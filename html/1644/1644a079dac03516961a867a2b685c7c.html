 FOREWORD
 This paper is one of thirty evaluations of the capabilities
 of Communist Parties in the countries of the free world.  It is di-
 vided into two parts:  (1) an analysis of the objectives, tactics,
 and capabilities of the party; and (2) a compilation of the specific
 "assets" of the party drawn up on the basis of an exhaustive check-
 list provided by the Central Intelligence Agency.
 The first part of the paper focuses on the actual current
 major objectives of the party; the specific tactics employed to carry
 them out; and the capability of the party to achieve its objectives
 assessed in the light of both past and present performance.-
 The second section of the paper is designed to supplement the
 evaluative portion of the paper by both itemizing the organizational
 potential and material assets of the party and, at the same time,
 providing an index to areas of Communist activity where information
 is inadequate, unreliable, or absent.  The data presented in the sec-
 tion on "Assets" should not be treated as definitive; they are rather
 .the best available to the Department at the present time.

 COMMUNISM IN BURMA:  OBJECTIVES, TACTICS, AND CAPABILITIES
 the Communists in Burma are at present pursuing a two-pronged,
 \and not completely consistent, policy.  The illegal Communist under-
 ground) is continuing the insurrection which began in 1948, and seems
 it present to be concentrating on maintaining and consolidating its
 control over."base areas," while training and strengthening guerrilla
 units for future action.  Efforts are also being made to develop
 effective alliances with other insurgent groups such as the White Band
 element of the People's Volunteer Organization and the Karen National
 Defense Organization.
 At the same time, the above-ground, Communist-dominated Burma
 Workers and Peasants Party (MPP), which is recognized by the govern-
 ment as a legal opposition group, seems most concerned with its own
 internal organization and with programs designed to develop popular
 support for the Party.  The BWPP is agitating for an end to insurgency
 through formation of a coalition government including opposition
 elements.  Communist efforts to recruit support within the Overseas
 Chinese Community are spearheaded by the China Democratic League (CDL).
 Within the framework of these general objectives, the Communist
 parties seek a number of immediate goals.  Domestically, current efforts
 are concentrated on:
 1.  combating the growth of anti-Communist sentiment among ,the over-
 seas Chinese;
 2.  penetrating Buddhist organizations;
 3.  increasing the membership of "mass organizations," which have
 thus far been relatively small in Burma; and
 4.  undermining the political position of the government and the
 Socialist Party which is its dominant element.
 Internationally, the chief immediate goal is to prevent a shift in
 official Burmese foreign policy toward the West and the US in
 particular.
 References in this section to insurgent activity refer principally
 to action by the Burma Communist Party (BCP).  Other Communist
 underground groups include:  (1) the Communist Party (Burma) --
 CP(B) -- which is a relatively small splinter group, and (2) a band
 of China-trained guerrillas under leadership of the Kachin renegade
 Naw Seng, which does not appear to be in contact with the BCP.

 There is, to some extent, a conflict between the policy of
 preparation for eventual overthrow of the government and "legal"
 efforts to establish a broad popular base and to create pressures
 leading to a coalition government.  The GUB is unlikely to be respon-
 sive to demands for a coalition as long as armed insurrection continues
 to threaten the political and economic stability of the nation, despite
 its apparent acquiescence in a rather artificial distinction between
 BCP insurgency and BWPP legal action.  At the present time, overall
 Communist strategy seems to favor the "legal" efforts of the BWPP.
 II.  TACTICS
 Current tactics include attempts to establish collaborative
 arrangements with other political groups and attempts to win direct
 following, for the party or'its fronts, from diverse elements within
 the Burman and minority populations.  The strength of the Communist
 appeal rests in the coincidence of certain aspects of current Communist
 policy with general Burmese fears and aspirations -- neutralist, anti-
 colonialist, and "peace" sentiments.                             The basically Marxist orientation
 of most present-day Burmese leaders, and the lingering sense of attach-
 ment to the homeland among the Chinese community also favor Communist
 efforts.
 Special appeals are directed to identifiable groups within the
 population -- particularly youth and students and, most recently, the
 Buddhist leaders.  There are some reports that Communist propagandists,
 perhaps aided by Chinese specialists, are attempting to subvert the
 minority peoples along the Sino-Burma border.
 The BWPP's small delegation in the Chamber of Deputies is
 important primarily as a focal point for expression of what are
 basically extra-parliamentary political pressures.  Popular organiza-
 tions controlled by the BWPP or its labor wing, the Burma Trade Union
 Congress, are utilized to create the impression of popular demand for
 policies favored by`the Party.  In addition, to opposing the-specific
 actions or presumed intentions of the Government, political pressures
 have been used in an attempt to destroy public confidence in the
 competence of the present Government.  In planning its program, the
 BNPP seems to be responsive to direction from the Chinese Embassy,
 through which it apparently receives some financial support.
 At the same time, guerrilla activity is continuing among under-
 ground groups.  Although the BCP forces have increasingly been broken
 up into small groups by Government military pressure, marauding bands
 still render large areas of the country insecure.  Present insurgent
 military operations seem designed primarily to secure supplies and
 manpower, and to keep government forces off balance.

 III.  CAPABILITIES
 The BCP is capable of continuing its present level of guerrilla-
 type insurgency, thereby preventing the consolidation of government
 control over all Burma and retarding economic recovery and development.
 The BWPP appears to have sufficient leadership, and an adequately dis-
 ciplined organization, to continue its agitational and penetration
 tactics, designed to maintain political pressure on the government and
 retard its slowly emerging trend toward a closer relationship with the
 West.
 The prospects for future Communist action will be determined
 largely by developments outside Burma, particularly decisions concerning
 broader Asian strategy.  In the.event of direct invasion or a greatly
 magnified program of direct aid to insurgent groups, the stability of
 the GUB would be seriously threatened.  The Government might, in the
 absence of immediate and effective help from the West, seek accommoda-
 tion with Asian Communism, and it is relatively certain that the
 prestige and power of local Communist elements would be rapidly
 magnified.
 In the absence of external intervention, however, the Government
 will probably continue to make progress in its efforts to suppress the
 insurgents and may, as larger areas of the country are secured, be
 emboldened to,take more restrictive measures against "legal" Communist
 elements.  In that event, the BNPP, which now appears to be the chief
 instrument of international Communist policy in Burma, might find its
 access to propaganda outlets circumscribed and its ability to manipulate
 front groups curtailed before its present organizational efforts have
 born fruit.  In the absence of actual or imminently threatened invasion,
 or of unforeseen internal economic disorders, it seems unlikely that
 the parliamentary position of the BWPP will improve significantly or
 that its mass base will grow materially.
 The capacity of Burmese Communist groups to support Soviet
 policy will, therefore, depend directly on Soviet (or Chinese) action.
 The 1948 insurrection by the BCP has this far failed in its primary
 aim of overthrowing the government and, balanced against an improving
 government position, its future is even less promising.  Were it not
 for the ever-present threat that the Burmese future will be over-
 whelmed by events beyond its borders, it might be predicted that the
 Communist conspiracy would continue,to wither, although at an
 agonizingly slow rate.

 COMMUNISM IN BURMA:  ASSETS
 I.  NUMERICAL STRENGTH
 An assessment of Communist strength in Burma must include both
 the illegal insurgent movement and above-ground Communist elements.
 Available data are insufficient to permit a definitive statement of
 total numerical strength.
 The Burma Communist Party (BCP) is the most important element
 of the underground movement.  Its membership is estimated to be
 .about 5,000.  A small splinter group, the Communist Party (Burma) --
 CP(B) -- was estimated in 1951 to have about 300 members and candi-
 dates.  The CP(B) split from the BCP in 1946 as a result of personal
 differences within the Communist leadership.  The two groups, however,
 reportedly concluded an agreement for at least limited military
 cooperation in August 1952.
 The principal above-ground group now appears to be the Burma
 Workers and Peasants Party (BPPPP), which was formed in December 1950
 by a group of dissident Socialists.. The party membership is unknown,
 but it has become increasingly well disciplined and energetic, taking
 effective leadership of Communist-dominated "front groups."  The most
 significant of the latter ares  (1) the Burma Trade Union Congress
 (BTUC) with a present estimated membership of about 2,000; (2) the A11-
 Burma Peasants Organization (ABPO), which claims a membership of
 100,000, probably with considerable exaggeration; (3) the World Peace
 Congress (Burma) with a small but vocal membership; and (4) the People's
 Youth Organization (PYO), which was founded only in December 1952 but
 which has considerable potential importance.  Communist organizations
 within the Overseas Chinese community are dominated by the China
 Democratio League (CDL), the nearest equivalent of a Chinese Communist
 Party.  The League's membership is unknown.
 Although the membership of Communist organizations therefore
 seems relatively small, the number of individuals who are subject to
 Communist influence and pressure is probably significantly higher,
 partly because of widespread receptivity in Burma to a number of aspects
 of current Communist propaganda efforts.  The number who are "strongly
 influenced" by Communist elements should probably include most of the
 membership of the non-Communist Trade Union Congress (Burma), and the
 membership of the People's Peace Front (PPF) and Mahabama parties, which
 collaborate with the B1fPP.  The Chinese population as a whole remains
 vulnerable to Communist pressure, but since 1950 vigorous efforts
 by non-Communist Chinese elements have probably reduced the number who
 are strongly influenced.  Rural populations are exposed to Communist
 propaganda and organizational effort for short periods in the course
 of guerrilla operations.  Although no adequate figures are

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 available, it seems likely that 5 percent of the total Burmese
 population may be controlled or strongly influenced by Communist
 elements.
 Geographically, Communist strength is heavily concentrated in
 Rangoon and the southern towns of Burma (the BRTPP and CDL groups)
 and in insurgent pockets in central and northern Burma (BOP).  The
 main sources of Burmese Communist recruits appear to have been
 students and youth, intellectuals, and peasants; urban labor has thus
 far been less significant.  Among the resident Chinese, the leadership
 is predominantly middle class in origin; laboring classes provide the
 bulk of membership; and a number of businessmen appear to be passive
 sympathizers.
 Comparatively little is known concerning the quality and
 reliability of the Communist membership or of its leaders,  Although
 the guerrilla groups undoubtedly include some elements whose principal
 motivation is organized banditry, the leadership appears to possess
 firm political resolve and to be in effective control of its following.
 The surrender rate among insurgent groups has remained relatively low
 despite mounting government military pressure.  Most of the leadership
 has belonged to Marxist, if not Communist, organizations for a period
 of five to ten years.
 The above-ground BWPP has recently been reorganized and "puri-
 fied" in a move which has apparently strengthened its internal
 homogeneity and removed elements of doubtful reliability.  Although
 it is probable that the total membership has declined somewhat since
 mid-1951, it seems likely that the strength and dependability of the
 party has increased, and that it will continue to exercise effective
 leadership of above-ground pro-Communist groups.
 The leadership of the China Democratic League is relatively
 more experienced and many of its important leaders have been trained
 in China.  The membership of the League increased markedly between
 1946 and 1950; in the last two years, however, its total strength has
 remained relatively stable and may have declined somewhat.
 II.  ELECTORAL STRENGTH
 Since the underground Communist parties are outlawed, Communist
 voting power is reflected only in the votes received by candidates of
 the BWPP and the parties which support it -- chiefly the People's
 Peace Front and the Mahabama.  The parliamentary strength of these
 groups in the Chamber of Deputies elected in 1951, related to the
 representation of other parties, is as follows:

 The most recent test of Communist electoral strength occurred
 in the Rangoon municipal elections of February 20, 1952.  The three
 .opposition parties listed above ran joint candidates, under the
 banner of the Triple Alliance.  The coalition won only one seat out
 of 35, in contrast with a representation of 15 seats for comparable
 parties in the Council elected in 1949.  However, these figures do
 not reflect BWPP strength adequately, for Triple Alliance candidates
 are reported to have received almost half the total vote given to
 candidates of the governing coalition (the Anti-Fascist People's
 Freedom League).  Nevertheless, the drastic decline in Council seats
 is significant because of the predominant role of Rangoon in national
 life.
 Although the BWPP and its affiliated groups are currently
 agitating for a coalition government including the Communists, there
 is no evidence of specific planning for future elections.
 III.  MILITARY STRENGTH AND ORGANIZATION FOR VIOLENT ACTION
 The Communist insurrection in Burma, coupled with Karen
 insurgency and the depredations of non-political bandit gangs, has
 effectively and seriously retarded Burmese recovery from wartime
 devastation. It is a continuing, though somewhat diminishing, threat
 to the integrity of the state.  The insurgency is exploited by above-
 ground Communist elements in their attacks on the government.
 Of the various insurgent elements, the Burma Communist Party
 (BCP) has been and remains the most significant.  The party controls
 as many as 8,000 guerrillas, which are now organized in small bands. _
 There have been no recent report of concentrations of more than 300
 in a single group.  The BCP is reported to have succeeded recently
 in establishing a coalition with two other underground elements:
 (1) the Communist Party (Burma), with an estimated strength of 1,000;
 and (2) some elements of the White Band People's Volunteer Organization
 -- total PPO strength is estimated at 3,000, but the effective
 strength of collaborating groups is unknown.  A potentially important
 group, which is now apparently independent of the BCP, is a force of
 Kachin-Burman-Chinese guerrillas, estimated at 1,500, under the

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORM&TION
 leadership of the renegade Naw gong.  Naw Seng'a two battalions have
 been trained in China, and may represent the best disciplined and most
 thoroughly indoctrinated insurgent group.
 All insurgent groups appear to be currently concentrating on
 strengthening their control of limited, relatively inaccessible "base
 areas."  BCP groups have been pushed back within the past year by
 government military operations; their current strength is located
 chiefly in central Burma south of Mandalay, in northern Burma, and
 in the western region stretching toward the Chin Hills.  CP(B) groups
 are located primarily in the Irrawaddy delta and westward toward the
 Arakan.  Naw Seng's force is reported to be in the Bhamo area in
 northern Burma.
 No significant military operations have been undertaken recently
 by-the insurgent groups except the BCP, and these have been confined to
 hit-and-run raids against government outposts, attacks on trans-
 portation and communications lines, and harassment of villages which
 are inadequately protected.  Troops not so engaged are concerned
 primarily with protecting Communist-held areas from government forces,
 but in case of attack, the Communists prefer to withdraw rather than
 fight as long as it is possible to remove supplies and equipment.
 Little has been learned concerning the administrative apparatus
 established by BCP groups in areas which they control.  Although the
 party claims to govern local areas -- appointing officials, directing
 education, and controlling marketing -- it is doubtful whether any
 permanent administrative apparatus has been established.  Above-
 ground Communist groups are primarily responsible for propaganda
 activity, but the BCP has undoubtedly carried on some propaganda work
 in connection with local recruiting efforts.
 The degree of popular support which Communist guerrillas have
 received seems to be a function of the military force which they can
 apply in any area.  For the most part, the rural population appears
 to be passive, reacting to preponderant military pressure and aiding
 guerrillas only when coercion is present or threatened.  The guerrilla
 groups live off the country, and no central supply organization is
 known to exist.  Even though the several groups are relatively
 independent, there is some intercommunication (including radio), and
 Communist intelligence concerning government operations appears to
 have been generally good.
 The BCP leadership has made persistent-efforts to secure
 effective working arrangements with other insurgent groups.  In
 August 1952, an agreement was reportedly reached with representatives

 of the Communist Party (Burma) and some White Band elements of the
 People's Volunteer Organization, providing for collaboration and
 demarcation of respective areas of activity.  Because of past. personal
 antagonisms among leaders of the various groups, the realization of a
 working arrangement would appear to reflect desperation born of
 declining strength, or perhaps a BCP effort to qualify for more
 extensive Chinese assistance by providing evidence of effective leader-
 ship of all guerrilla elements.
 External assistance (from China) to the Communist guerrillas
 has thus far been sporadic and at a relatively low level.  Some BCP
 cadres are reported to have received training in Yunnan.  Naw Song's
 guerrilla units have been trained in China, and may pose a more
 significant long-term threat to the government by establishing a
 protected base area in a remote region of northern Burma.  There are
 no reliable reports of significant amounts of arms being furnished to
 Burmese guerrillas from China.
 In its efforts to suppress the Communist insurgency, the Burma
 Government has been handicapped by the necessity of simultaneously
 containing Chinese Nationalist troops in eastern Burma, attempting to
 subdue Karen rebels,.and suppressing'Moslem dissidents in the Arakan.
 Total government strength of about 60,000, including the Union
 Military Police, is heavily taxed by its varied responsibilities,
 and the forces available for anti-Communist efforts fluctuates from
 time to time, in accordance with demands created by the actions of
 other dissident groups.  Key posts are manned; mobile reserves are
 maintained at central locations; and from time to time offensive
 actions are taken against isolated pockets of resistance.
 In the absence of stepped-up external assistance, the future
 capabilities of the Communist insurgents are not likely to improve.
 Although the guerrilla forces have been able to maintain their
 strength for some time, no significant expansion has taken place.  It
 is not clear whether manpower or arms shortages represent the chief
 limitation.  On balance, the government position has improved within
 the past year; perhaps the most significant development has been the
 increasing fragmentation of guerrilla forces and the restoration of
 agricultural production in some areas of the Irrawaddy delta which
 have been cleared on insurgents.  In addition to weakening the
 resource base of the Communists, this development will, in the long
 run, contribute to the strength and stability of the government.
 So far as is known, the above-ground BWPP has organized no
 paramilitary units, and has no plans for participation in violent
 action.  In order to keep its present legal status, the party must at
 least preserve the appearance of being no more than an opposition
 political party.

 IV.  GOVERNMENT. POLICY TOWARD CO1gMUNISM
 Present government policy draws a somewhat artificial distinction
 between political pressure and insurgency which, in turn, hat led to
 the development of the two arms of the Communist movement in Burma.
 The insurrectionary Communist parties -- BCP and CP(B) -- have been
 outlawed by the Government, and exist only as underground movements.
 The E PP, however, is a legal, political party, has a small parlia-
 mentary representation (9 seats out of 232) and is relatively unob-
 structed in its manipulation of front groups.  (Exceptions  the
 government has occasionally denied passports to proposed delegates to
 international Communist meetings.)
 Because of official reluctance to prevent distribution of
 literature which is not openly seditious, Communist propagandists
 have secured important outlets for dissemination of printed propa-
 ganda, taking advantage of an existing market for any literature which
 is interpreted as shedding light on "experiments in sooialism."
 Recently, however the Home Minister issued a.atrong warning to
 publicists who spread false information, advocate armed uprising, or
 undermine the security of the state.
 Within the Chinese community, the CDL and other Communist fronts
 have been permitted considerable political freedom of action in Burma,
 owing to the Burma Government's neutralist foreign policy, its desire
 not to antagonize Communist China, and to. the fact that Peiping has not
 encouraged the Burma Chinese to indulge in overt agitation against
 the Burma Government.  Nevertheless, Chinese Communist political
 activity is limited by the Burmese constitutional provisions that only
 Burmese nationals may vote and by the exclusion of a large proportion
 of the Chinese from Burmese citizenship.
 During 1951-52, the increasingly vitriolic anti-Western tone of
 local Chinese Communist propaganda, which the Burma government deemed
 injurious to Burma's neutral position, and the affiliation of pro-
 Communist Chinese with Burmese extreme leftist opposition elements, led
 to the government's tacit encouragement of anti-Communist elements
 in the Chinese community.  It is expected that the government will
 continue its present policy of sharply scrutinizing, though not
 severely restricting, local Chinese Communist political activities,
 and of tacitly encouraging the anti-Communist Chinese.
 V. COD'MtJNI ST INFLUENCE IN LABOR

 union membership is probably leas than 70,000.  The Socialist-
 controlled Trade Union Congress (Burma) -- TUC(B) -- split in

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 December 1950 when the BWPP was organized; the dissident union leaders
 formed the Burma Trade Union Congress (BTUC), which is now Communist-
 controlled.
 The most important affiliates of the BTUC are the All-Burma
 Ministerial Services Union (ABMSU), which is small but vital because
 its members staff government offices, and the Chauk Oilfields Workers
 Front.  Total BTUC membership was estimated in mid-1952 at less than
 2,000.  The percentage of Communists to non-Communists within the
 BTUC unions is unknown; the leadership is Communist, however, and
 .appears to be in effective control.
 In addition to the BTUC, there are at least a dozen Chinese
 labor unions, most of them small and concentrated in Rangoon; all
 except the Carpenters Union are Communist-controlled.  The Most
 important are those which deal with food marketing and handling, the
 Teachers Union, and the Stevedores Union.
 Apart from Communist-controlled unions, there is probably some
 surviving Communist influence in most of the unions affiliated with
 the Socialist-led TUC(B).  Since the 1950 split, the struggle for
 control between BTUC and TUC(B) leaders has been particularly strong
 in the Inland Water Transport Workers Union and its. five subsidiary
 groups.  Although the leadership now supports the TUC(B), Communist
 influence may still be prevalent in some locals.
 The Communist-controlled BTUC has been affiliated with the
 World Federation of Trade Unions (vFTU) since July 1951.  The status
 of the TUC(B) in relation to WFTU is at present unclear.  Prior to the
 1950 split which led to formation of the BTUC, the parent organization
 had been affiliated.    A 1951 May Day resolution expressed interest in
 continued membership, but TUC(B) leaders have since stated that the
 group is not presently affiliated.  It is certain that the TUC(B) has
 not been active in WFTU affairs.
 VI.  COMt(UNIST INFLUENCE IN SOCIAL,
 CULTURAL,                              TONS
 The most active Communist front organizations are in the fields
 of youth and student activities, international "friendship" societies
 and the Communist "peace movement," and among the Overseas Chinese.
 The following groups merit special mention:
 1.  Youth:  There are two underground youth organizations, the
 Communist Youth League and the Democratic People's Youth League, which
 are probably small but under effective BCP control.  The BWPP sponsored
 no distinct youth organization until December 1952, when the People's

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Youth Organization (PYO) was founded.  Although at present, in the
 formative stage, the PYO may become the focal point for Communist
 activity among youth and students.  The only non-Communist youth
 organization, the Burma Youth League, is non-political and relatively
 insignificant.
 2.  Studentes  The All-Burma Students Federation (ABSF) and the
 All-Rangoon   u en s Union are believed to be Communist-controlled.
 The ABSF is probably affiliated with the International Union of
 Students,    The only competing organization is the Rangoon University
 Students Union (RUSU) which has experienced.a continual struggle for
 control between Communist and non-Communist elements.  The most recent
 elections for union officers reflect some persisting. Communist
 influence.
 3.  The World Peace Councils  The Burma Branch of the World Peace
 Council -- WPC(!) -- is probably one of the most significant "front"
 groups although its active membership is believed to be relatively
 small.  Branches of the parent organization have been established in a
 number of towns, and the group may be the most effective instrument
 for dissemination of Communist propaganda outside of Rangoon.  The
 Council is controlled by the BWPP; its Secretary General, Ba Nyein,
 is a member of the BRPP Executive Committee and is considered the
 party's "leading thinker."
 4.  Chinese Organizationez  A number of organizations within the
 Overseas CM MO community are  ommunist-controlled or at least pro-
 Peiping.  Next to the China Democratic League, the most important
 Chinese group is the Chamber of Commerce.  Its leadership is pre-
 dominantly pro-Peiping, although control is being vigorously contested
 by anti-Communist elements within the Chamber. The Hui-an Young Men's
 Association, the Chinese Youth Society, and the Chinese Students Union
 attempt to spread Communist influence among youth and students; the
 first two are outstanding among all Chinese youth organizations.  Of
 the several regional Chinese societies, the Fukienese Association is
 the only ohe which is considered to be Communist-dominated.  Other
 Communist-oontrolhed Chinese organizations includes  the Chinese
 Women's Association, the Women's Welfare Workers Society, the Burma
 Chinese Relief Association, and the Burma Chinese Cultural Union.
 .5.  Women:  The All-Burma Women's Freedom League, formed by
 the BWPP in-Tanuary 1951, is the most active of three legal women's
 organizations in Burma.  A smaller group, the A11-Burma Women's Union,
 is controlled by the BCP and has been underground since'1947.
 6.  Friendship Societies:  The Sino-Burmese Friendship Society.,
 and the Burma-Soviet Cultural  ssooiation are small but significant ,

 groups, because membership is drawn largely from educated and therefore
 relatively influential classes.  The former is now composed exclusively
 of.Burmese, and is devoted to promoting interest in China and preserving
 "traditional ties of friendship."  The latter was formed with tacit
 approval of the Soviet Embassy in Rangoon, but appears to be operated
 by Burmese, including some non-Communists, who are interested in
 Soviet culture.
 7.  Minorities:  Apart from the numerous Chinese organizations,
 the principal minority groups controlled by Communists or Communist-
 sympathizers are the All-Burma Indian Youth League and the All-Burma
 Indian Congress.  Communist penetration of the Indian minority has
 been largely limited to laborers, some of whom are also represented
 in Communist-dominated unions.
 Organizational efforts appear to be directed at present toward
 enlarging Communist-controlled units within important organizations
 and securing mass support for the propaganda appeals of above-ground
 Communist groups.  Most politically conscious Burmese support some
 policies which are currently advocated by local Communists:  eg.,
 resolution of the problem posed by the Chinese Nationalist troops in
 Burma, some aspects of the "peace" campaign, and anti-colonialism.
 It has not been possible to determine the extent to which advocacy
 of such programs by non-Communist Burmese represents conscious support
 of particular Communist policies.  Quite clearly, however, Communist
 influence extends beyond those organizations which are controlled or
 strongly influenced by Communists.

 VII.  COMMW IST INFILTRATION INTO GOVERNMENT
 Direct Communist infiltration of the Burma Government appears to'
 have been slight.     So far as is known, no Communists are represented in
 policy-making bodies or in top levels of the military and police organ-
 izations.                                  Although there are probably some Communists or Communist-
 sympathizers on the staffs of the several government departments, there
 is no evidence that they have had a direct impact on policies and pro-
 grams of the government.
 Nevertheless, it may be well to point out  that, indirectly at
 least, Communist "influence" is present within the government' at almost
 all levels.  The most important Communist asset is the strength of Com-
 munist China; fear of antagonizing the powerful neighbor to the north
 has been directly responsible for the government's rigid verbal adherence
 to a neutral foreign policy.
 Secondly, most government officials subscribe to Marxist views
 in fields such as economic organization, and their background has
 stimulated an interest in "socialist experiments" in other parts of the
 world.  Many are known to read Soviet and Chinese. literature.  This
 indirect influence is stronger with.some individuals than others.  The
 present Minister of Land Nationalization, Thakin Tin, for example, holds
 extreme leftist views on nationalization and collectivization, although
 he is not known to be a Communist.  In general, there is far more
 interest in the Chinese "experiment" than in the Soviet Union, and it
 is doubtful whether such interest is attributable, at the top levels of
 government, to direct Communist infiltration.
 Just as there is some indirect Communist influence at official
 levels, so interest in China and to a limited degree a curiosity about
 the USSR have opened the way to some Communist influence on the public
 opinion-forming process.  This is attributable as much to the predispo-
 sitions of non-Communist Burmese as to direct  efforts by Communist
 elements.
 There is some Communist influence in educational circles, partio-
 ularlythe Chinese schools and in higher Burmese educational institutions.
 Of the more than 200 Chinese schools in Burma, a majority appear to be
 using Peiping-approved textbooks, although there has been some recession
 in Communist penetration since 1950.  There is also continuing Communist
 penetration of student groups at Rangoon University .
 Penetration of Buddhist, circles has thtrs far been slight, although
 efforts to secure Buddhist support for international Communist `"causes`"

 are currently being intensified, apparently with some success.  The
 government has shown genuine concern over these developments, and is
 endeavoring to counteract Communist influence by stimulating Buddhist
 revival programs, denying passports to Buddhist priests recruited for
 international Communist conferences, etc.
 The Communist press is relatively small, but non-Communist
 publications, on their own initiative, support some current Communist
 propaganda themes (most notably, the "menace" of Chinese Nationalist
 troops in eastern Burma, and evidences of "colonialism" in all parts
 of the world.)
 The Soviet Embassy in Rangoon has recently secured an outlet
 for Chinese and Russian films, by renting the King Theater on .a monthly
 basis.  During 1951 over 100 Chinese films were exhibited in Rangoon,
 and although the contents are not known, it seems safe to assume that
 many ccntained Communist propaganda themes.
 IX.  COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF NON-CO)~119JNIST POLITICAL PARTIES
 No noteworthy infiltration of right-wing political organizations
 and parties has come to light.  Among left-wing, non-Communist politi-
 cal groups, there has been considerable indirect influence; some ele-
 ments of Communist dogma (anti-colonialism, collectivism) have wide
 appeal in most political circles in-Burma, due to historical experience
 and Marxist training of most national leaders.  Direct Communist in-
 fluence, however, appears to be declining.  There is an increasing
 tendency, particularly at the top levels, to distinguish between cur-
 rent Soviet behavior and the theoretical Marxist formulations to which
 many Burmese leaders. still adhere.
 Collaboration with Communist elements by some Karen leaders and
 Dr. Ba Maw's Mahabama party appears to be based on expediency, rather
 than on ideological compatibility.

 X.  COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA ^AEDIA
 For practical purposes,.the Rangoon press is synonymous with
 the Burmese press.      Very little publishing activity is carried on out-
 side the capital city, and for that reason, human-carrier techniques
 are probably more important in the dissemination of Communist propa-
 ganda than formal media of communication.  In addition to the
 periodicals listed below, there is a considerable amount of pamphlet
 literature circulated within Burma, a good deal of it prepared or
 controlled by Communist organizations.

 Viet Minh representatives in Rangoon publish a weekly bulletin
 entitled "Vietnam Information."  Its total circulation is unknown.
 Distribution to many parts of the world is handled in Rangoon.
 The Chinese Embassy apparently subsidizes one or more papers in
 Rangoon, but is not known to publish any periodicals itself.
 Local radio broadcasting is a government monopoly, and no direct
 Communist influence has been discernible.  There is no known Communist
 broadcasting activity in Burma, except possibly for some radio communi-
 cation among guerrilla units.  The military network, if it exists, is
 probably used primarily for operational liaison and not for public
 propaganda activity.
 There is a limited audience for both Soviet and Chinese broad-
 oasts.  Soviet broadcasting appears to be confined to daily trans-
 missions in English directed to Southeast Asia, plus the Soviet
 Chinese-language service which can perhaps be heard in Burma.  The
 audience for Chinese Communist broadcasts is probably limited to the
 Chinese community.  Approximately 30 hours per week on international
 beams can be picked up in Burma.  Although no figures are available,
 the number of radio receivers is sufficiently low so that radio is a
 much less significant medium for external propaganda than publications
 and personal contaot.

 XI.  FINANCIAL C(NDITION
 No quantitative data on Communist finances are available.  It
 is doubtful whether the dues-paying membership of Communist organiza-
 tions, particularly in the labor unions, is very large, and direct
 receipts of this kind can be only a minor element in total party
 finances.  The underground guerrilla groups appear to be heavily de-
 pendent on local requisitioning and foraging in the areas of current
 military operations.
 Above-ground Communist groups are known to receive contributions
 from businessmen and other groups which are vulnerable to persuasion or
 pressure.  The China Democratic League, in particular, probably derives
 part of its financial support from merchants engaged in trade with
 China.  It is not known, however, whether any of these firms exist
 primarily for purposes of financing Communist activity.
 Leaders of the Burma Workers and Peasants Party apparently re-
 ceive some financial assistance through the Chinese Embassy in Rangoon.
 The money spent on local rallies (where, frequently, no collections
 are taken) suggests outside financial help.  In addition, supplies of
 Chinese Communist publications are a direct contribution to local
 Communist propaganda activity.  It is not known whether the Soviet
 Embassy has contributed directly to local party finances.
 In general, the financial condition of the Burmese Communists
 appears to be poor, with the exception of activities connected with
 the increasingly virulent propaganda campaign.  The guerrilla groups
 have been able to sustain their present level of activity, but do not
 appear to have financial resources adequate to attract wider support
 or to procure additional arms.
 Chinese Communist elements, by virtue of their ability to exact
 donations from local businessmen, are in much better financial condi-
 tion than the Burmese groups.

 XII.  SOVIET SATELLITE OFFICIAL ASSETS
 A.  Communist China
 The first Chinese Communist Ambassador to Burma presented his
 credentials in September 1950. By August 1952, the Embassy staff was
 reported to include 15 principal officers and 26 other members.  Many
 of these individuals are described as "active outside," implying that
 considerable efforts are made to keep in contact with local Chinese
 organizations of.various types.  Supplies of printed propaganda are
 apparently funneled through the Embassy for distribution throughout
 the Chinese community, utilizing schools, commercial, labor, and cul-
 tural organizations as outlets and as centers for displays.  It is
 probable that propaganda activity, in the broadest sense, is an impor-
 tant responsibility of most members of the Embassy staff.
 The Sino-Burmese Friendship Society also functions with support
 from the Chinese Embassy.  Its membership (total unknown but apparently
 relatively small) includes non-Communists interested in cultural re-
 lations with China as well as pro-Communist elements.
 The Soviet Embassy was established in Rangoon in April 1951, with
 an original staff of eight.  In late 1951, the total staff was reported
 to number 31, including housekeeping and administrative personnel.  The
 Embassy has a Press Attache, and it seems probable that other staff
 members are.engaged in essentially propaganda and contact work, since
 the size of the Embassy is greater than regular Embassy activities would
 justify.
 The Burma-Soviet Cultural Association, headed by a respected
 'member of the Rangoon University faculty, was founded early in 1952.
 The Soviet Embassy appears to have left the initiative primarily to
 Burmese intellectuals interested in the USSR, with quiet encouragement
 for the society's activities.  The first open meting was attended by
 about 200 persons, but active membership is not known.
 C.  European Satellites
 A Czechoslovak Consulate General was opened July 10, 1952, but
 no information on its staff is available.  A Hungarian trade delegation
 is reported to be in Rangoon, but its size also is unknown.  The
 activities of both the Czech Consul General and the Hungarian trade
 delegation members, although ostensibly directed toward increasing trade,
 probably include activities which should be labeled as propaganda.

 XIII.  COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 Although no international Communist organizations maintain
 permanent bureaus or offices in Burma, the activities of some of these
 groups have been an important part of the total Communist propaganda
 effort in Burma.  Local propaganda organs play up Burmese participation
 in international conferences both before and after Burmese delegations
 have gone abroad.

 Although the delegations have usually included Communists, they have not
 been composed exclusively of known party members.
 Burmese participation in the work of international "front"
 organizations seems to have been largely limited to att ndanoe at these
 conferences.  Although no reliable data'are available,,  t seems/ un-
 likely that financial contributions have been received from,Burmese
 groups. On the contrary, the international organization,i 3 appear to
 subsidize the participation of Burmese groups, at least to~thq extent
 of underwriting expenses while travelers are in orbit countries.

 XIV.  COMMUNIST COMMUNICATION NETWORK
 A.  International Party Channels
 All Communist elements in Burma emphasize the country's ties to
 China, because of a general Burmese sense of nearness to China and an
 interest in Chinese developments.  Outwardly, therefore, the closest
 international links appear to be with Communist China.  Ties with the
 Indian Communist Party have not been close, although one finds
 occasional references to liaison with representatives of the East
 Bengal Communist Party.
 There is ample, although circumstantial, evidence that above-'
 ground Communist elements follow international Communist directives
 concerning propaganda drives, although local implementation of specific
 campaigns is frequently tardy.  Under the direction of local "front"
 groups, the world-wide "signature campaigns" are carried on in Burma,
 and particular propaganda themes related to Far Eastern affairs are
 generally carried in local organs.  It is not known, however, whether
 the Chinese or the Soviet Embassy is the original source of directives
 to local groups.
 Although there are frequent reports of directives from Chinese
 or Soviet officials concerning party strategy in Burma, it is impossible
 to determine whether specific moves, particularly with reference to
 guerrilla'aotivity, are the direct result of Chinese or Soviet direction.
 Since early in 1952, there seems to have been a shift in emphasis, from
 direct military action to above-ground agitation for a "united front"
 government and an end to insurgency.  It is not clear whether the mili-
 tary weakness of the insurgent groups is responsible for the shift, or
 whether it was made in response to a directive concerning general Asian
 Communist strategy.
 1.  International courier system. The Chinese Embassy in Rangoon is
 known to have a regular courier service, and it is probable that the
 Soviet Embassy provides similar facilities.  In addition, commercial
 channels are readily-available within the Chinese community.  There are
 reports that crew members of ships calling at Rangoon serve as contacts
 with both Chinese and Soviet Embassies, but details are unavailable.
 There is also direct overland communication with China, but it is not
 possible to state whether these routes are more important than sea con-
 tacts.  Available evidence suggests, without definite proof, that the
 above-ground BWPP has direct access to the Chinese Embassy in Rangoon,
 and that the underground BCP maintains overland contact with China.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORM TION
 It is probable that arrangements for guerrilla training in China are
 made by direct liaison with Chinese officials in Yunnan.
 29"  Domestic communications.  The nature of current Communist
 operations reduces the need for close integration among the several
 elements.  Above-ground activities are concentrated in Rangoon and in
 major towns, and personal travel is limited only by deficiencies in
 local transportation.  Underground activity is apparently linked by
 courier and radio facilities between guerrilla areas, but details are
 unavailable.  Radio equipment is frequently moved to avoid capture,
 and the location of present installations is unknown.

 FOREWORD
 This paper is one of thirty evaluations of the capabilities
 of Communist Parties in the countries of the free world.  It is di-
 vided into two parts:  (1) an analysis of the objectives, tactics,
 and capabilities of the party; and (2) a compilation of the specific
 "assets" of the party drawn up on the basis of an exhaustive check-
 list provided by the Central Intelligence Agency.
 The first part of the paper focuses on the actual current
 major objectives of the party; the specific tactics employed to carry
 them out; and the capability of the party to achieve its objectives
 assessed in the light of both past and present performance.-
 The second section of the paper is designed to supplement the
 evaluative portion of the paper by both itemizing the organizational
 potential and material assets of the party and, at the same time,
 providing an index to areas of Communist activity where information
 is inadequate, unreliable, or absent.  The data presented in the sec-
 tion on "Assets" should not be treated as definitive; they are rather
 the best available to the Department at the present time.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFCRMPTION
 COMMUNISM IN INDOCHINA:  OBJECTIVES, TACTICS, AND CAPABILITIES
 All of the immediate objectives of the Communists in Indochina are
 related to their effort to win the bitter civil war which they are waging
 against the forces of the French Union.  Within the area which they have
 conquered, the Communist objective is to improve their control over popu-
 lation and resources in order to maximize their total military effort.
 Within the areas controlled by the legitimate Governments of Vietnam, Laos,
 and Cambodia, the Communist objectives are:
 1.  To subvert the loyalty of the population.
 2.  To improve the party's covert organization.
 II.  TACTICS
 Communism's objectives in Indochina are furthered by the Soviet and
 satellite-recognized "Democratic Republic of Vietnam," its Chinese-supported
 and equipped army, its administrative and control organizations (police,
 secret  and security services, propaganda organizations, administrative
 cadres), and by its popular front movement, the "Lien Viet" or 'National
 Unity Front."
 The entire insurrectionary structure is held together and controlled
 by the Laodong (Comunist) Party.  It is the Laodong Party which, in the
 final resort, operates the complex mechanism of war, propaganda, and compul-
 sion which appears to the people of Vietnam and to the outside world as the
 "Viet Minh" movement.  And the Laodong Party, in turn, is managed by a
 group of highly trained and thoroughly experienced revolutionary leaders.
 The Communist Party in Indochina uses both military tactics and
 political warfare tactics to further its over-all objectives.
 Its military tactics are designed: (1) to inflict maximum disrup-
 tion and destruction on enemy forces and enemy war potential in the rear
 zones, with the minimum expenditure of Viet Minh forces; (2) to infiltrate,
 occupy, and consolidate territory with a view to securing a continuing
 reservoir of potential manpower recruitment for the army and to finding
 the necessary economic means (mainly food) to support intensification of
 the war.  These tactics have been highly successful.  For over six years
 the Viet Minh has inflicted heavy casualties on the Franoo-Vietnamese
 forces, while paralyzing Indochinese economic life and preventing the
 country's recovery.  The Viet Minh is now strongly established in North and
 Northwest Tonkin, in the lightly industrialized and food-producing regions

 of North Central Vietnam, and in the coastal plains of South Central
 Vietnam.  Most of China's long common boundary with Indochina is now
 in Viet Minh hands, permitting continued Chinese Communist assistance %
 to the Viet Minh armed forces.
 Communist political warfare tactics are designeds (1) to ex-
 tend Communist Influence among all social and economic groups in the
 populations of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos; and (2) to consolidate
 Communist control over conquered areas and populations.
 Communist propaganda attempts to exploit sentiment "for independ-
 ence" and "against French colonialism."  To some extent, but only within
 carefully-drawn limits, the attempt to make the Viet Minh effort appear
 one of genuine national resistance to a foreign colonizing power con-
 tinues to displace certain other considerations in Communist tactics.
 Thus, Catholics in the Viet Minh zones have not been persecuted, nor,
 until very recently, attacked ideologically, so that the pretense of
 continued Catholic support for the "war of resistance" could be main-
 tained.  Similarly, although agrarian reform has been strongly stressed,
 landlords have been dispossessed only where it was essential to secure
 fuller cooperation on the part of the landless peasantry.  Orthodox
 Communist doctrine has generally taken second place to "anti-imperialist"
 themes in Viet Minh propaganda.  However, whenever the priority needs of
 intensifying the armed struggle have demanded that themes of "national
 unity" and nationalistic propaganda be soft-pedalled, this has been done,
 particularly since 1951.
 Efforts to consolidate Communist control over areas and popula-
 tions already under Communist influence center upon the peasantry.
 Basic Viet Minh policies and the major part of its propaganda output
 are calculated to increase the peasantry's contribution to the military
 effort.  Both within and outside the zones under direct Viet Minh control,
 the Communists rely heavily upon conspiratorial methods and upon a large
 and widespread system of terror and compulsion.  Such a system has been
 essential not only in providing the necessary vehicle for Communist control
 of the vast masses of people (some 12 million) and the variegated leader-
 ship which the Viet Minh movement has brought under its banners,, but also
 in order to gather the necessary intelligence for military operations and
 political warfare.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFO tM&TION
 If Franoo-Vietnamese military strength in Indochina does not
 increase, the Viet Minh may become strong enough within the next few
 years to be able, without identifiable Chinese Communist interven-
 tion, to break the current stalemate.  While the Viet Minh's military
 capabilities are at present limited by its exclusion from the more .
 productive regions of Vietnam, this might be overcome by significantly
 increased Chinese Communist materiel and technical assistance and by
 conquest of further territory.  At the same time, although the regime
 continues to be based largely on compulsion and terror and to depend
 mainly for the achievement of its objectives upon increasingly harsh
 exploitation of a war-weary peasantry, the Viet Minh's administrative
 and control capabilities seem adequate to counteract any growth of
 discontent among the populations and armies under its control.  The
 Viet Minh's popular hold on substantial portions of the populations
 outside its own zones, based partly on military prestige, partly on
 continued nationalist appeal, and partly on a widespread mechanism of
 compulsion and terror, is likely to be increased or decreased in.
 proportion to the military power and ideological dynamism which the
 free world, and above all the free states of Vietnam, Cambodia, and
 Laos may be able to bring to bear against it.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 I.  NUMERICAL STRENGTH
 Communist Party membership, following and strength are heavily
 concentrated in the areas of Indochina controlled by the "Demooratio
 Republic of Vietnam."    In the "DRY", the official Communist party, the
 LAO DONG (Workers) Party,has a membership variously estimated at be-
 We-on56,000 and 715,000.                          Although reliable data on the number of
 people under Communist Party discipline is lacking, the all-enocaspassing
 coverage of the constituent organisations of the Communist-controlled
 National Unity Front (LIEN VIET), suggests that a majority of the 12.7
 million inhabitants of the "DRY" may be considered under effective
 Communist control.
 In the areas under the control of the Associated States govern-
 ments of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, the Communist party is proscribed.
 However, there are obviously Communists in all of these areas, due to
 the ease with which the non-Cosmunist regions can be infiltrated.  In
 Vietnam particularly, but also in Cambodia and Laos, a number of
 clandestine Viet Minh or Chinese-Communist-controlled organizations are
 believed to be operating.
 How many of the 9.9 million population of free Vietnam are under
 Communist discipline cannot be estimated.  Clandestine Communist opera-
 tions are, however, relatively successful.  In part, this is due to a
 widespread Communist system of compulsion; on the other hand, the Viet
 Minh cause continues to exert considerable national appeal in the free
 zones of Vietnam.  It is possible that a substantial portion of the
 Vietnamese population and of the 800,000 Chinese in Vietnam are
 sympathetic to the objectives of the Viet Minh and therefore susceptible
 to Communist influence.
 In Cambodia, it is unlikely that more than 10 percent of the
 population of 3 million (including the Chinese) are strongly influenced
 by Communism.  However, acme 5000-10,000 Viet Minh guerrillas, mainly
 concentrated in the Southern provinces, are reported fighting in units of
 about company-.size against Franco-lbaer forces.  In early 1952, the
 Chinese Communist regime claimed the loyalty of 60 percent of the 300,000
 Chinese in Cambodia.  While this claim is undoubtedly exaggerated, a sub-
 stantial percentage of the Chinese in Cambodia are believed to be under
 Communist influence.
 In Laos, the number of people under Communist influence is believed
 to be extremely small - perhaps one percent of the one million population.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 The number of Viet Minh guerrillas in Laos is estimated at about 5,000.
 Communist strength is believed heaviest in the DRV-controlled
 provinces of North Tonkin and North Central Annam; less numerous in "DRV"
 areas in Central Annam and Cochinohina.  Communist influence in free
 Vietnam is probably strongest in the urban areas of Saigon-Cholon, ?anoi,
 and Haiphong.  In Cambodia, Viet Minh influence is strongest in the
 southern provinces where guerrilla units are concentrated.  Chinese
 Communist influence in Cambodia is strongest in Phnom-Penh where the
 Chinese population is heavily concentrated.  In Laos, Communist influence
 is strongest in the Bolovens Plateau region where the Viet Minh guerrillas
 are mainly based.
 Communist Party membership in Indochina is believed to be composed
 principally of professionals and government employees.  In the "DRY",
 industrial workers probably constitute an additional important membership
 group.
 Communist leadership in Indochina is believed to be well-eduoated
 (Western Europe, China and the USSR), thoroughly experienced, completely
 dedicated, and competent to fulfill not only its present responsibilities
 but those it would inherit as a consequence of total victory in Indochina.
 The average age of the sixteen current top-level Communist leaders is 47.
 Many top leaders have been active since 1930.
 II.  ELECTORAL STRENGTH
 On January 6, 1946, the Viet Minh Government held elections for a
 "Vietnam National Assembly" in an effort to legitimize its rule.  In
 addition to the polling in-areas of North and Central Vietnam under
 DRV control, clandestine votes were taken in parts of South Vietnam.
 There is considerable doubt as to the extent to which these elections re-
 flected the popular will; an implausibly large vote was olaim.ed for a
 country where the parliamentary system is all but unknown.  Among the
 300-odd members of the "elected Assembly," the Viet Minh (then ostensibly
 a coalition of left-wing and nationalist parties under Communist domina-
 tion) emerged as the largest party with 80 delegates.  The 90 independents
 probably also included a significant number of Communists and another
 group of 15 Communists was elected under the label of the "Marxist Party."
 No further elections have been held in the Communist-held areas of
 Indochina.  Elections have, however, taken place in Laos and Cambodia
 and are now about to take place in free Vietnam, although, of course,
 without Communist participation.

 III.  MILITARY STRENGTH AND ORGANIZATION FOR VIOLENT ACTION
 A.  Total Strength and Character of Communist Forces
 The Viet Minh disposes of a total armed strength of about 315,000
 men, distributed as follows:
 Regular Aray:         1300000
 Regional Forces:       750000
 Peoples Militia:      110,000
 The Regular Army is a well-trained, well-equipped, highly aobile,
 modern fighting force capable of waging effective positional warfare
 against France-Viet amese forces.  The Regional Forces are lase well
 equipped and generally recruited regionally for static support of the
 Regular Army.  The Peoplets Militia is locally recruited for village
 defense and small-scale guerrilla action.
 B.  Security of Controlled Areas
 The Viet Minh armed forces of 315,000 men, which are employed both
 for the defense and security of controlled areas and for offensive opera-
 tions based on these areas, are distributed within the "DRV"-controlled
 areas as follows:  174,000 men in Tonkin; 80,000 men in Central Vietnam;
 46,000 in South Vietnam; 10,000 in Cambodia; and 5,000 in Laos.
 The population in Communist-controlled areas has generally been
 stable and tightly-controlled.  Disturbances and riots have, however,
 occasionally been reported, particularly in the strongly Catholic Vinh
 and Thanh Boa regions of Korth Central Vietnam.
 Civil administration in "DRV"-controlled zones is in the hands of
 administrative cadres directly responsible to the "DRV" Ministry of
 Interior.  It is logical to suppose, although no information is available
 on the subject, that the Viet Minh armed forces have at least temporary
 control of civil administration in regions only recently conquered.  This
 control is presumably exercised by political and administrative cadres of
 the Army.
 C.   Military Support Organizations
 "DRV" supply, cgmmunioations, and intelligence organizations are
 highly developed units operating at all levels of the military administra-
 tion.                   Their authority is derived from Directorates attached to the
 General Staff of the army.  Information concerning the strength of the
 various support organizations is not available  although these organiza-
 tions may be assumed to be quite large.  Their networks are known to
 embrace all of Vietnam, including Franoo-Vietnamese areas.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORI[ATrON
 In view of the fact that North Vietnam is not only the theater of
 the most active military operations but also the seat of the "DRV" govern-
 ment, supply, cormnunioations, and liaison functions are presumably conr-
 oentrated in that area.  Intelligence activities are probably concentrated
 in urban centers (chiefly Hanoi and Saigon) as strongly as in strategic
 military areas.
 Available reports indicate that "DRV" support organizations have
 achieved a high degree of efficiency.
 D.  External Military Support
 rrrrrr i r             r.r.rr.Reports from a variety of sources, in most oases neither evaluated

 totals. Moreover, in a few oases where cross-checking of reported
 totals has been possible, resultant discrepancies have cast further
 doubt upon the validity of the figures reported.

 E.  Military Operations
 Military operations in Indochina since 1946 have been conducted in
 virtually all areas of the peninsula, but have.been principally concentra-
 ted in-North Vietnam (Tonkin).  There, Communist forces have been fighting a
 savage battle for over six years for control of the crucial rice.
 producing Red River Delta (in which the key cities of Hanoi and Haiphong
 are located).  At present about 174,000 Communist troops are pitted
 against an estimated 185,000 Franoo-Vietnamese forces in the Tonkin
 region.  The principal tactic of the Communist forces has been to harrass
 the Franoo-Vietnamese Army by guerrilla warfare inside the Delta and by
 massive attacks against isolated French posts and cities outside the
 Delta..
 A turning point in the battle for Tonkin was reached in the fall
 of 1950, when Viet Minh forces, in quick succession. seized all French
 .posts along the China border (Langson, Caobang, Laokay), excepting only
 Monoay in the extreme eastern coastal sector.  In the fall of 1952,
 Communist forces expelled the French from all of Northwest Tonkin, ex-
 cept Laiohau and Nason.  At this moment, therefore, the Communist forces
 hold most of Tonkin outside of the key Delta region.  The latter, how-
 ever, in which the vast bulk of Franco-Vietnamese foroes is now oonoen-
 traced, has been heavily infiltrated by Viet Minh forces and is
 besieged at its periphery by some five Viet Minh divisions.
 In Central Vietnam, an estimated 75,000 Franco-Vietnamese forces
 hold the narrow coastal plain from Faifo to Dong Hoi against some 80,000
 Communists who are in control of the remainder of the area.  In South
 Vietnam, an estimated 162,000 Franco-Vietnamese forces control most of
 the region, but conduct frequent and difficult operations against some
 46,000 Viet Minh guerrillas, oonoentrated principally in the unhealthy
 and almost impenetrable swamps of the Plaine den Jonas.  In Laos and
 Cambodia, Communist military operations are apresen  limited to small-
 scale harrassment by guerrilla forces.
 F.  Popular Attitudes. Toward the War
 The peasantry of Indochina has borne the main brunt of the long war.
 The peasantry serves as a reservoir of manpower for the armies involved,
 performs the coolie duties of supply, engages in sabotage and informer

 operations at the order of one aide or the other, constructs public
 works, and -- over and above all this -- produces the food for its own
 subsistence and that of the non-productive hundreds of thousands in the
 armies.  By this time, the peasantry clearly abhors the war and
 anxiously hopes for its and.
 General passivity toward either side in the conflict may in fact
 be said to characterize the sentiments of the vast majority of Indoohina's
 civilian population.  However, passivity is less noticeable, and the
 effects of political warfare and propaganda by either side are more
 marked, among city dwellers.  The nationalist pretentious of the Viet
 Minh, rather than Communism itself, continue to hold much appeal for
 Indochina's urban population, whether inside the Viet Minh zones or in
 areas of Franoo-Vietnamese control.
 G.  Current Strategic and Tactical Objectives of the Communist Insurrection
 Current strategic and tactical objectives of the Communist
 insurrection are military and political consolidation over newly-won
 territories in northwest Tonkin, and intensified penetration by Viet
 Minh regular forces into the Franoo-Vietnamese held Tonkin Delta area,
 The "DRV" probably will intensify guerrilla warfare in the plateaux
 region of Central Vietnam as well as in Cambodia and South Vietnam and
 may also attempt a limited military penetration into Laos.  In Central
 Vietnam, the Communist forces will probably continue to maintain strong
 pressure against the Franoo-Vietnamese forces along the coast.
 H.  Relations of Communist to Non-Communist Insurrectionary Organizations
 1.  Vietnam.  In June 1951 Colonel Trinh Minh The, former Chief of
 Staff ohs armed forces of the autonomous politico-religious Caodaiet
 movement, took to the bush with 2,500 men in South Vietnam to set up
 "the National Resistance Front," a "third force" opposed to both the
 Viet Minh and the French.  Since the spring of 1952, when the French
 launched military operations against this group, Coionel The has not
 been heard from and his current whereabouts are unknown. There is no
 evidence that Colonel The has collaborated with the Viet Minh.
 2.  Cambodia.  In March 1952, Son Ngoc Thanh, a leading Cambodian
 nationaUet, organized a dissident nationalist movement.  At first, the
 activities of this group seem to have been limited to propaganda attacks
 against the French and Cambodian King.  In recent months, broadcasts of
 Son Ngoo Thanh have been increasingly favorable to the Viet Minh, but
 the present relationship between these two movements is not clear.
 3.  Cambodian and Laotian Issaraks. The Cambodian and Laotian
 Iesaraks, un er the-leader-ship-respectively of Son Ngoo Minh and Prince

 Souphanouvong, have been formally allied with the Viet Minh movement
 since March 1951 when the "United National Front of Vietnam, Cambodia,
 and Laos" was established.  In the past, military efforts of the
 Issaraks have been for the most part limited to sporadic guerrilla
 warfare, banditry, and arms smuggling across the Thai border.
 A closer degree of cooperation seems to have been achieved during
 the past year between the Viet Minh and the Cambodian and Laotian Issaraks.
 From 5,000 to 10,000 Viet Minh are reportedly with the Cambodian Issaraks
 and 5,000 with the Laotian Issaraks.  In October and November, 1952, a
 Laotian delegate accompanied the Viet Minh delegation to the Asian and
 Pacific Peace Conference in Peiping. In December delegates from both "Free
 Cambodia" and "Free Laos".participated in the World Peace Conference in
 Vienna,
 anabilities for Expansion and Action in the Near Future
 Despite the relatively low level of military industrial production
 within "DRV" areas and a reportedly increasing food shortage, the "DRV"
 could probably expand the present scope of its military activities to a
 limited extent without significantly increased support from Communist
 China or from other Orbit countries.
 If, as seems likely, the Issaraks receive greater material assistance
 and technical advice from the Viet Minh, they would be able to expand
 theirnumbers and extend their operations.
 IV.  GOVERNMENT POLICY TOWARD COMMUNISM
 A.  Repressive Capabilities of the Associated States and France
 French and Associated States policy toward Communism in Indochina
 is the military destruction of the Viet Minh armed forces and complete
 eradication of Communist activities and influence throughout the peninsula.
 No Communist parties, groupings, or organizations are allowed to
 exist or operate in the Associated States of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.
 The overt circulation of Communist publications in Franco-Vietnamese
 controlled areas is prohibited and the possibility of Communist-oriented
 material appearing in the controlled press is negligible due to tight
 censorship exercised by both the French and the Associated States.  Severe
 repressive measures are taken against any individuals, groups, or organiza-
 tions believed operating under Communist instructions or for Communist

 - 11 -
 purposes.  Such repressive measures are expected to continue until
 hostilities in Indochina have ceased and internal political stability
 is assured.  They are carried out by civilian security services of
 France and the Associated States, and insofar as the security of
 components of the French Union Armed Forces is concerned, by the
 military intelligence and counter-intelligence services of these forces.
 At present, the scope and effectiveness of repressive action of
 which the French and Associated States civilian and military security
 agencies are capable in Indochina cannot be rated better than fair.  By
 contrast, Communist subversive operations are believed to be,'on the
 whole, very effective.  Possibly the greatest asset of Communist under-
 ground and subversive organizations of all types lies in the generally
 apathetic attitude of the Vietnamese population as a whole toward the
 conflict which is raging in its territory.
 B.  Extent and Effectiveness of Communist Subversive Operations
 Communist subversive operations in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos
 fall into two major categoriess those carried out by Viet Minh subversive
 teams and underground networks, and those carried out by clandestine
 Chinese Communist organizations.
 Viet Minh organizations operating in the French and Associated
 States-oontrolled zones of Indochina are for the most part responsible
 directly to the central "DRV" government, or its regional representatives.
 They perform three general types of assigned tasks: propaganda; political,
 economic, and oounter-intelligence;l and terrorism and sabotage.'
 The propaganda function is carried out by teams responsible to the
 Information Services of the central "DRV" government.  The total number
 or size of such teams is unknown,  but their effectiveness seems to have
 been considerable.  Espionage activities are carried out by organizations
 and units of unknown size believed to be attached to the regional Cong An
 (Public Security Service) of the Viet Minh, which is the latter's internal
 security organization.  Espionage agents reportedly are assigned
 specialized tasks, the most important of which is the infiltration of
 French and Associated States intelligence and security services.  Terrorism
 and sabotage within the free zones is performed by the Dich Van which in-
 cludes Death Volunteer Brigades, apparently assigned to operate in specific
 regions. The effectiveness of the,Dich Van is reportedly great; it has
 seriously disrupted. highway and rai7i  raTffc, damaged industrial and
 Military espionage is carried out by intelligence organizations
 responsible to the Directorate for Military Intelligence of the "DRV"
 Armed Forces General Staff.
 2.  Certain types of sabotage activities are carried out by organized
 guerrilla and commando units of the Armed Forces.
 3.  In 1951, ten such Information teams were reported to be operating
 in South Vietnam.

 military installations, and organised numerous terroristic acts in major
 urban centers, the most important of which was the assassination of a
 number of highly prominent French and Vietnamese civil and military
 personalities.  One of the most successful activities of Viet Minh sub-
 versive organizations has been the extortion of money from prominent
 French and Chinese as well as from Vietnamese business firms.  Many of
 these firms regularly pay large sums of "protection money" to Viet Minh
 agents in order to avoid bombing of their premises.
 The "DRV" benefits considerably by the intelligence activities
 carried out by Chinese Communist underground organizations in the non-
 Communist zones.  Since 1949, the Communist-directed "Association for
 the Liberation of Overseas Chinese in Indochina" has organized various
 clandestine student, women's and workers' organizations in Saigon-Cholon
 where approximately 80 percent of the total overseas Chinese population
 of some 800,000 is concentrated.  During 1952, the creation of a
 clandestine "United Action Committee of Democratic Sino-Vietnamese" was
 reported, also in Saigon-Cholon.  In North Vietnam, the "Society of New
 Chinese Democrats of Hanoi and Haiphong" reportedly intensified intelligence
 activities during 1952.  The size of these organizations is unknown although
 it is believed they have been fairly successful in gaining the sympathy
 .of certain of the Chinese population, particularly among students and
 workers.  Specific underground activities which have been reported include
 extortions of money for the protection of relatives in China, the circula-
 tion of Communist tracts and publications believed to be for the most part
 procured in Hong Kong, and the placement or pro-Communist instructors in
 Chinese schools.  In Cambodia, the Chinese Communist Party, whose head-
 quarters reportedly is located in Phnom-Penh, claims the sympathy of 60
 percent of the 300,000 overseas Chinese in that country.  No information
 is available concerning its activities or effectiveness.
 V.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN LABOR
 In "DRV" controlled areas, all workers in key industries are con-
 trolled by Communist elements, although the number of Party members in
 specific enterprises is unknown.  In the Associated States of Vietnam,
 Cambodia and Laos, the number of Communists in key industries, if any,
 is unknown.
 In "DRy" areas of Vietnam, the General Confederation of Labor,
 which is controlled by the communist Party, claimed "500,000 members" in
 1952.  The Confederation is composed of numerous affiliated trade unions
 organized at provincial levels throughout Vietnam.  It has been reported
 that although not all of its directors are Party members, those exercising
 any real authority are.  The Confederation has been affiliated with the
 World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) since the former's organization in
 1946 and has been represented at WFTU Conferences since 1948.  In addition
 to the General Confederation of Labor, the Viet Minh reportedly organized
 a Trade Union Council in 1950 to embrace "intellectuals and civil servants."

 No further information is available concerning this Council.
 In the free areas of Vietnam, labor organizations were prohibited
 until the promulgation of the Labor Code on November 16, 1952.  The
 principal Vietnamese labor union, which until last November operated as
 an association, is the Christian Confederation Vietnamienne du Travail
 Chretien, reported to have 5,000 members.  A number of civil servants
 in     i the French and Vietnamese. administrations, belong to Force
 Ouvriere which has its headquarters in France.  Although provisions of
 the new Labor Code in Vietnam do not extend to the overseas Chinese
 population, Chinese labor groups have for some time been loosely associated
 in a Federation of Chinese Mutual Aid Societies.  The 19 organizations
 comprising this Federation claim an aggregate membership of some 11,000.
 No information is available on Communist infiltration of, or in-
 fluence in, these labor unions in Franco-Vietnamese areas of Vietnam.
 However, the Chinese organizations are the most likely to have been
 infiltrated or influenced by Communists.
 VI.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN SOCIAL, CULTURAL, AND
 PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 In both the free and the Communist zones, the Lien Viet (National
 Unity) Front has developed an extensive and intricate network of front
 organizations to enlist the support of the peasants and special interest
 groups for the "resistance against French aggression."  The leaders of the
 front organizations are believed to be mostly well-indoctrinated and
 capable party cadres, many of whom work in more than one organization.
 What appear to be the most important front organizations are listed belows
 1.  The Union of Vietnamese Youth claims a membership of
 2,500,000 and has been affiliated with the World Federation
 of Democratic Youth since 1947.
 2.  The Union of Vietnamese Students and Pupils has been
 affiliated with the International Students Union since 1948,
 3.  The Union of Vietnamese Women claimed 3,000,000 members as
 of 1950.  It has been affiliated with the Women's Inter-
 national Democratic Federation since 1945..
 4.  The Catholic Association for National Salvation.
 5.  The Association of Vietnamese Journalists has been affiliated
 with the World Federation of Journalists since 1950.
 6.  The Vietnam World Peace Committee is affiliated with the
 World Peace Council.

 7. -The Vietnamese Peasants Association for National Salvation.
 8.  The Sino-Vietnamese friendship Association.
 9,  The Soviet??Vietnamese Friendship Association.
 In addition to Viet Minh front organizations, the Chinese Communist
 Party has organized various youth, workers', women's and cultural under-
 ground front organizations.  These organizations are believed to be
 strongest in the Saigon-Cholon area of South Vietnam and in the Phnom-
 Penh region of Cambodia, where the majority of the overseas Chinese
 residents in Vietnam and Cambodia are located.
 Many, if not all, of the "Lien Viet front groups have effective
 underground organizations within -Me areas under Franoo.-Vietnamese con-
 trol.
 Little information is available concerning non-Communist social,
 cultural, or professional organizations which may have been infiltrated
 by Comanunists.
 VII.  COMMUNIST INFILTRATION INTO GOVERNMENT
 Such infiltration is unquestionably a serious problem for the
 anti-Communist governmentsof the Associated States.  Although policy-
 making bodies of these states are believed to be to a large extent free
 from subversive Communist personnel and influences, the same can
 probably not be said with regard to the Armed Services, police and
 security services, and administrative cadres of the States.  Communist
 subversion is believed to have reached particularly serious proportions
 within Vietnam's National Army.  The Army Officer's Training School at
 Dalat has been reported strongly infiltrated by Coiunist elements, and
 certain Vietnamese troop companies in action in North Vietnam have proved
 of marked unreliability.  The Vietnamese, and even French, security
 services in North Vietnam are also believed penetrated to sons extent by
 Communist elements.
 No reports of Communist penetration of government agencies and
 services in Cambodia and Laos have been received, although it is likely
 that a limited degree of infiltration may be considered to have occurred.
 VIII.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE ON PUBLIC OPINION FORMATION
 In the "DRV"-controlled zones of Vietnam, leaders of public pro-
 paganda organizations are usually Party cadres.  Communist propaganda has
 undoubtedly reached nearly the entire population in these zones, chiefly
 through the effective organization of mass front organizations and compulsory
 study groups at provincial and village levels.

 In free Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, no known Communists are in a
 position to influence public opinion.  There are probably a considerable
 number of concealed Viet Minh sympathizers or agents, however, in schools,
 journalistic, and literary groups.  The prohibition of Communist publics..
 tions, tight press censorship,and the extremely limited number of radio
 sets among the population in Franco-Vietnamese controlled areas have
 tended to insulate the population from Communist publications and broad-
 casts.  Nevertheless, it is likely that Communist influence has been
 spread fairly successfully through clandestine operations and through
 direct contact of many individuals with underground Viet Minh agents.
 IX.  COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF NON-COMMUNIST
 The most important non-Communist nationalist organizations and
 parties in Indochina are the Dai Viet Party, the Cao Dai politico-
 religious group, the Vietnam  a  ona ist Party (V- and the Catholics
 in Vietnam, and the Democratic Party in Cambodia.  Although information
 is generally laoking on their membership, these parties and groups are
 thought to embrace several hundred thousand members.  The extent of
 Communist influence in these organizations is unknown, but is not be.
 lieved to be large due to the strongly anti-Communist, although clearly
 pro-nationalist, sentiments of most of their leadership.
 Branches of the above-mentioned organizations are still in some
 instances allowed to operate in "DRV"-controlled zones, where the Catholics
 and some Caodaists, for example, maintain social organizations.  However,
 the Communists have undoubtedly strongly infiltrated these branches and
 probably control them completely.  The same would be true for nominally
 non-Communist parties and organizations existing only in the "DRV" Zones,
 such as the Vietnam Democratic Party and the Socialist Party, which the
 Communists continue to tolerate in order to bolster their nationalist
 pretensions.
 X.  COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA MEDIA
 A.  Newspapers and Periodicals
 Listed below are the newspapers and periodicals known to have
 been published by the Viet Minh in 1951 or 1952.  Where known, the
 frequency of publication and the principal area of circulation are in-
 dicated.  These publications are also clandestinely distributed in
 Franoo-Vietnamese-controlled areas by Viet Minh underground organiza-
 tions.

 The "DRV" controls the following broadcasting stations which have
 regularly scheduled programs beamed to Indochina and to Southeast Asia:
 1,  Voice of Vietnam is regarded as the official government
 s    on.     is reportedly located in the Vinh area.  News
 is broadcast daily to Indochina and Southeast Asia in French,
 English, Tonkineae, Thai, Mandarin, and Cantonese.
 2.  Voice of South Vietnam has tentatively been located north
 of    gon,      roa oasts three programs daily of news and
 commentary in Coohinohinese and one in Mandarin.
 3.  Voice of Nambo is reputedly located in the Mekong Delta area.
 It carries  our programs of news and commentary daily, one
 each in Cochinchinese, French, Cantonese, and Cambodian.
 In Cambodia, the Voice of Issarak Cambodia is operated by the Issarak
 leader Son Ngoo Minh.  One-half hour of news an  comment is broadcast daily
 in Cambodian.
 Radio Moscow broadcasts one hour daily in Tonkinese and occasionally
 in Coo  no  nese.  Radio Pekin  broadcasts one hour daily in Tonkinese,
 and twice daily for 15 to      nutes in Thai.  Reception of the Thai
 language program is reported to be poor.
 Considering the small number of radio receiving sets in the
 Associated States, it is likely that Communist radio broadcasts reach
 only a very limited audience and achieve only limited propaganda effects
 outside the Communist zones.   Within these zones, however, they are used
 as an extremely important,and probably effective, means of disseminating
 propaganda and official orders to the population.
 The "DRV" authorities collect both direct and indirect taxes, many
 of then in kind, impose "duties" on goods entering Communist zones from
 the Franco-Vietnamese zones, and exact "voluntary"donations through various
 "emulation campaigns."  The amount of revenue thus collected is unknown,
 as is the size of any subsidies from international Communist organizations,
 donations or credits by Soviet or Satellite governments. or dues from
 party-controlled labor unions and fronts.  Nor is any information available
 on the amount of revenue collected through extortion of Vietnamese, French,
 and Chinese business firma in the non-Communist zones.

 Although the USSR, Caamaunist China, and other satellite countries
 have recognized the "DRV", they have not established diplomatic missions
 there.  However, Communist China has sent various temporary military and
 economic missions to the Viet Minh.  During 1952 a 50-man Chinese
 cultural mission was reportedly sent to Thai Nguyen in North Vietnam
 for the purpose of establishing political liaison with the "DRV" govern-
 ment, and an economic mission is said to have been not up also in North
 Vietnam to study economic resources. Current estimates place the number
 of more or less permanent Chinese Communist personnel-- technicians,
 instructors, military and political advisors -- with the Viet Minh at
 approximately 5,000.  All Chinese Communist Missions are surrounded by
 secrecy.  It is believed that contact between Chinese personnel and
 natives is held to a minimum.
 A Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association and a Soviet-Vietnam
 Friendship Association were organised inside the "DRV" in early 1950.
 Both organizations are associated with the "Lien Viet Front" and have
 established branches throughout "DRV"-oontrollC d areas of Vietnam.
 These organizations are reported to have clandestine branches in the
 free areas, particularly in the Saigon-Cholon district.  Propaganda
 committees are m"eported to have been established at the branch levels of
 both Associations.  In addition to parrying out regular propaganda
 activities, these associations are responsible for sponsoring celebrations
 of major Chinese Communist and Soviet holidays.  The Sino-Vietnamese
 Friendship Association has published a journal, China-Vietnam, since
 May 1950.
 While it is not known to what extent, if any, the Viet Minh move-
 ment may have been aided materially by international Communist organiza-
 tions, it has been granted a significant extent of moral support by
 such organisations through invitations to participate, often in a glorified
 role, in Communist international conferences.  In the past two years,
 delegates from the "DRV" and in two instances from "Free Cambodia" and
 "Free Laos" have attended the following international Communist *eetingsz

 XIV.  COMMUNIST COMMUNICATION NETWORK
 The Communists in Indochina maintain closest international ties
 with Communist China, which recognized the "DRV" on January 18, 1950 and
 received the credentials of the first "DRV" Minister in April, 1951 (his
 status has now been raised to that of Ambassador), and with the USSR,
 which recognized the "DRV" on January 30, 1950, and received the
 credentials of a "DRV" ambassador in April 1952.  Close ties are_
 also maintained, although much less prominently and for the most part
 covertly, with leaders of the French Carsmunist Party.  Relations have
 also developed between the Viet Minh leadership and leaders of the
 Eastern European and Korean Communist regimes.
 The clear harmony between Viet Minh and international Communist
 policies leaves no doubt that close coordination with the international
 Communist movement prevails.  Proof that Communist China supplies high-
 level guidance to the Viet Minh leadership was recently received in the
 form of a Chinese Communist broadcast supplying the "DRV" government
 with the draft of a proposed address by Ho Chi Minh, written in China by
 the "DRV" Ambassador to that country.  It is likely that frequent
 consultations between China and the "DRV" take place, and that a certain
 amount of day-to-day guidance is provided by the temporary technical and.
 military missions now present in the "DRV" areas.  It is also probable
 that the Viet Minh representative in Moscow sends home frequent guidances
 and reports.

 Efficiency of "DRV" contacts with the main Communist centers in
 Pei-p+ing and Moscow is presumably very good, since the French now
 control only one of the customary routes across the Chinese-Vietnamese
 border.  Radio contact between Communist China and the "DRV" is main-
 tained through stations BAL 6 and GMH in China, which relay broadcasts
 between the "DRV", China, and other Communist countries.  It is be-
 lieved that contacts maintained by the Indochinese Communists with
 France and with other Southeast Asian or Pacific countries are probably
 less efficient,

 FOREWORD
 This paper is one of thirty evaluations of the capabilities
 of Communist Parties in the countries of the free world.  It is di-
 vided into two parts:  (1) an analysis of the objectives, tactics,
 and capabilities of the party; and (2) a compilation of the specific
 "assets" of the party drawn up on the basis of an exhaustive check-
 list provided by the Central Intelligence Agency.
 The first part of the paper focuses on the actual current
 major objectives of the party; the specific tactics employed to carry
 them out; and the capability of the party to achieve its objectives
 assessed in the light of both past and present performance.-
 The second section of the paper is designed to supplement the
 evaluative portion of the paper by both itemizing the organizational
 potential and material assets of the party and, at the same time,
 providing an index to areas of Communist activity where information
 is inadequate, unreliable, or absent.  The data presented in the sec-
 tion on "Assets" should not be treated as definitive; they are rather
 the best available to the Department at the present time.

 COMMUIiISU IN INDONESIA:  OBJECTIVES, TACTICS, AND CAPABILITIES
 I.  OBJECTIVES
 The major current goals of the Communist Party of Indonesia
 (PKI) are to gain general acceptance as a genuine nationalist party
 in Indonesia, to perfect the party organization and to consolidate
 control over 's, variety of front groups, including the largest of the
 labor federations in Indonesia.  In pursuing these aims the PSI has
 attempted to recoup such prestige as it lost, first, in the course of
 the Madiun uprising in September 1948 and, second, as a result of a
 series of arrests of Communist leaders by the Indonesian government
 in August 1951.
 Secondarily, the PKI attempts, especially through the activities
 of its front organizations, to cause Indonesia's "independent foreign
 policy" to be directed in such a way that ties with the Soviet bloc are
 strengthened at the expense of relations with the West.  Thus, the
 PKI advocates the exchange of diplomatic representatives with the USSR,
 non-cooperation with the UN embargo on shipments of strategic items to
 Communist China, increased trade with the Soviet bloc, and rejection
 of US economic.. and military aid.
 The political climate in Indonesia, characterized by a lack of
 cohesive policy on the part of the major political parties and a
 general uncertainty as to the direction Indonesia will take in the
 immediate future both domestically and internationally, enhances the
 PKI's capability to pursue these several objectives concurrently.
 'While present emphasis is on furthering the domestic political fortunes
 of the party,'particularly with the prospect of general elections in
 the next year, past experience suggests that should the requirements
 of international Communism demand it, a quick reversal might be
 effected, and international considerations be given precedence.
 At this stage it is not clear whether the PKI hopes to achieve
 its ultimate goal of direction of the Indonesian state through peace-
 ful constitutional means, involving subversion of non-Communist
 groups, or through eventual armed insurrection.  It is likely that
 the party's internal consolidation is pursued with both possibilities
 in view.
 In its attempt to gain popular acceptance, the PKI has been
 able to capitalize on existing anti-colonial sentiment and has taken
 a strong stand on a number of issues which also form a part of the
 programs of other political parties.  Thus, the PKI advocates abroga-
 tion of the Round Table Conference agreements with the Netherlands,

 termination of the activity of the  Netherlands Military Mission,
 "restoration" of Western New Guinea (Irian) to Indonesian control,
 and nationalization of such foreign enterprises as the North Sumatra
 oil fields and the Bangka and Billiton tin mines.  These pronounced
 aims of the PKI,,shared as they are with other political groups,
 appear to be only means to enhance the national standing of the party.
 More general tactics directed toward this same and are the
 publicly announced support of the present Wilopo government by the
 PKI and efforts apparently undertaken in various localities to form
 a series of "Representative Councils" under PKI leadership.  These
 united front tactics were justified in a party statement issued in
 explanation of the first Communist support rendered an Indonesian
 government since Madiun:
 The formation of .the Wilopo cabinet opened rather extensive
 possibilities to the PKI and the other people's organi-
 zations to work publicly; they need no longer perform under-
 ground activities as they did during the Suleiman... cabinet
 5reoeding government ...This is the conclusion; in the
 present condition,   a PKI and the people have to choose one
 of these two; a democratic bourgeois government or a
 fascist bourgeois one....
 On several occasions since the and of the war, the PKI has
 stressed the desirability of a united front.  The PAI has also
 attempted in the past year to seize the initiative in organizing
 celebrations of national holidays.
 At the same time that the PKI has endeavored to reestablish a
 patriotic reputation by positive action, it has refrained from
 outspoken opposition to the government's programs, thus trying to
 overcome a reputation for negativism.  In conformance with this policy,
 the PUI was relatively restrained in recent Parliamentary debates
 critical of the leadership of the armed forces and the Ministry of
 Defense, and took care to deny complicity in the resulting anti-
 Parliament demonstrations.  In paying lip service to respect for
 democratic institutions the PKI has probably also been concerned for
 its political future should anti-Communist military leaders seize
 a larger measure of control.
 The PKI- has attempted to appeal to all social groups, and has
 had its greatest success in the organization of labor.  SOBSI
 (Sentral Organisasi Buruh Seluruh Indonesia), the PKI-controlled

 strikes in vital industries throughout Indonesia.  Harbor operations,
 transportation, petroleum and some estate rubber production were
 brought to a virtual standstill.  Since that time, the Indonesian
 government has restricted labor activity through a series of committees
 to which labor disputes are to be referred for compulsory settlement.
 Although SOBSI organizations have refrained from disruptive activity
 in the past several months in conformity to the PRI program of
 cooperation with the government, a potential for renewed agitation
 exists.  Among the more important other PKI front organizations in
 Indonesia are women's, youth, students, and peasants organizations,
 the People's Cultural League and the Indonesian Committee for World
 Peace.
 These groups echo the PKI program and propaganda in parlia-
 ment, communicate Communist propaganda to mass groups, attempt to
 enlist the support of non-Communist groups for Communist causes, and
 participate in national conferences and international meetings of
 Communist front organizations.  SOBSI and two peasant organizations
 are represented in the Indonesian parliament.  Although there is no
 separate Chinese Communist Party organization in Indonesia, many of
 the same purposes are accomplished within the Chinese community by a
 separate series of front organizations.
 In addition to controlling completely the activities 'of the
 above organizations, clearly recognizable as Communist front groups,
 PKI members attempt to infiltrate other mass organizations.  An
 article published in the official PKI organ in February 1951 on 'The
 Role of the PKI and Mass Organizations" states:
 "Communists who are assigned to join organizations, such as
 labor unions which are under the leadership of Trotskyite:
 or Social Democrats, are not to leave such organizations,
 for that would mean that we were allowing these masses to
 continue under the leadership of those who are really
 enemies of the people.... Therefore, we Communists may not
 refuse to work in a mass organization, no matter how
 reactionary it is."
 Communist efforts are also made to infiltrate ministries of
 the government, the police and military forces.  Apart from the
 known presence of Communists in the Ministries of Labor and
 Information, there is little evidence to indicate the degree of
 success enjoyed by the PSI to date in attaining this objective.
 Since the abortive Madiun rebellion in 1948, the PSI has, in
 general, refrained from violent activity.  Nevertheless, the party
 controls several small armed bands and is believed to continue
 attempts to infiltrate other dissident organizations.

 SECRET : 3ECUAITY INFORMATION
 The PKI in the course of its past history was often divided in
 its leadership and evidenced the same lack of cohesion and direction
 that characterized most other Indonesian political groups.  Today, fol-
 lowing the injection of considerable new blood into the party, there is
 every evidence that the PKI adheres closely to policy as transmitted
 through international Communist channels.  Liaison is believed to be
 effected through the Chinese Communist Embassy and at international
 Communist meetings.  Should the dictates of international Communism
 so demand, the PKI today would probably not hesitate to reverse its
 tactics, even at the risk of weakening seriously its domestic position.
 III.  CAPABILITIES
 The PKI today.is better organized and better-led than at any time
 in its past history. The party appears to be enjoying a considerable
 degree of success as a result of its policy of cooperation with the
 Indonesian government and its espousal of generally popular causes.  As
 long as it adheres to this policy of united front tactics its potential
 for expanding membership and enhancing its following would appear great.
 At the same time, the fact that the other major political parties advocate
 much the same program and are not faced with the PKI'a constant problem
 of establishing its identity as an indigenous party, militates against
 the party's becoming so strong that it might participate in an Indonesian
 government.
 One major purpose of the party's united front tactics has been to
 assure that it will not lose its present parliamentary representation
 when general elections are held.  It is not possible to forecast election
 results at this time, but judging from the Indian experience in conduct-
 ing elections with a largely illiterate electorate, the organization of
 the PKI, particularly among front organizations, will probably assure it
 representation disproportionate to its real popular support.
 As a vehicle for gaining sympatby for international Ccinxmmist
 causes, the PKI is limited in its success among politically articulate
 Indonesians by a general awareness of the nature of Ccnnudsm and the
 role played by front organizations, and by suspicion of the motives of
 advocates of either side in the cold war.  The party's appeal among the
 masses, in turn, suffers Prom a lack of awareness on-the part of most
 Indonesians of all but immediately pressing local problems.  Nevertheless,
 PSI propaganda as delivered through the several front organizations
 capitalizes on the strongly nationalist sentiment of the people.  Thus
 it is probable that the people as a whole are more susceptible to Communist
 propaganda influence than the more politically sophisticated leadership
 groups.

 It is unlikely that the PKI will in the foreseeable future be
 able to wage organized warfare against the Indonesian state, but it
 may be expected that all opportunities will be developed to subvert
 dissident groups with an eye toward future eventualities.  The party
 does continue to possess the capability of disrupting economic life
 through the activities of the labor unions it controls, but such
 activity would run counter to the law and might jeopardize the
 reputation for cooperation and concern for the national interest
 that the party has been nurturing. so carefully.

 C **WNISK IN INDONESIAs  ASSETS
 I. .~CA,ALL STRENGTH
 Estimates of Indonesia. Con n nist Party (PKI) strength vary from
 30,000-100,000 but no details are available. No separate Chinese Com-
 munist Party organization is known to exist in Indonesia, although the
 Chinese community, as noted below, possesses its own mass front organi-
 zations.  The PKI is strongest in Java and Sumatra and party activity
 seems best organized in the major cities, but little information is
 available concerning regional organization.
 Much of the leadership and probably a large portion of party
 membership are middle class intellectuals, but the bulk of party sym-
 pathizers are unskilled agricultural and industrial laborers and farmers.
 A majority of the party leaders have been educated or trained abroad, and
 Samsun, one of the PKI'S founders, is in Moscow where he is credited with
 playing a major role in Soviet planning for Indonesia.  Other Indonesian
 Coammnists are known to be in Prague, Pei-piing and Amsterdam.
 Beset by undistinguished and ineffective leadership thrnughont
 most of its history of three decades, the PKI in the postwar period has
 experienced a new vigorous direction on the part of both the overt Central
 Committee and its underground directorate.  Party leadership today may be
 divided between a small group of older prewar members and a majority group
 of more recent leaders - averaging 30-35 years in age -- who have ac-
 knowledged adherence to the party or front organizations only in the post-
 war period.
 While the government's security action of August 1951 against the
 Communists increased pressure on the party and for a time restricted its
 freedom of action, the most prominent and important leaders of the PKI
 escaped capture at the time, and many lesser lights have since been re-
 leased.  There has been no evidence of dissension within party ranks in
 the past two years,, and the present leadership appears prepared to under-
 take whatever action party strategy demands.
 II.  ELECTORAL STRENGTH
 No general elections have been held in Indonesia to date.  The PKI
 occupies 15 seats (7 percent) out of 220 in the provisional Parliament.
 If satellite parties and fellow travellers are included, a total of 40
 seats (19 percent) are controlled by the PKI.

 III.  MILITARY STRENGTH AND ORGANIZATION FOR VIOLENT ACTION
 Current PKI policy is to refrain from violent activity and to
 enhance its popular support through ostensible cooperation with the
 government and other political parties.  Past experience in the post-
 war period, however, indicates that the party will not hesitate to en-
 gage in violent action when strategy so demands.
 In September 19,8 during negotiations between the Republic and
 the Netherlands, the PKI undertook an armed uprising at Madiun in
 Republican-held territory.  Party strategy at that time was apparently
 aimed at precipitating a renewal of Dutch military action against the
 Republic in the course of which the PKI hoped to seize leadership of
 the Indonesian resistance.  Premature action on the part of some of the
 rebelling units and prompt counteraction on the part of the Republic
 resulted in the suppression of the Communists after considerable loss
 of life.  In August 1951, the Communists led a raid on Tandjung Priok, port
 area of Djakarta, in order to test the party's ability to execute this
 type of maneuver as well as the government's capability of coping with
 disruptive activity.  It was this action that hastened the Indonesian
 Government's decision to effect a series of security sweeps, in the course
 of which many prominent Communists and fellow-travellers were arrested.
 The Indonesian Communists are believed to have infiltrated dis-
 sident organizations currently engaged in armed insurrection and may
 possess small armed bands of their own, but reliable information on this
 subject is lacking.  Judging from their conduct of and participation in
 non-violent demonstrations, Party members presumably would be available
 in major cities for conducting violent demonstrations.  Although the PKI
 probably has an organization for violent action and the quality of leader-
 ship is greatly improved over 1948, the success of any large-scale insur-
 rection would probably depend on complete Communist subversion of existing
 dissident groups or units of the armed forces.  PKI control of most or-
 ganized labor, the largest farmers' organizations and important youth groups
 might provide considerable backing for whatever violent action the Party
 might undertake.
 IV.  GOVERNMENT POLICY TOWARD COWUNI94
 The PKI enjoys the same freedom as other Indonesian political
 parties, but the Indonesian Government limits the extent to-which the
 PKI and its allied organizations can engage in propaganda attacks on
 friendly states and the degree to which it may express its international
 ties.  Thus, pictures of international Communist leaders are occasionally
 prohibited at Communist rallies, and propaganda films of a flagrant nature
 are banned.  In August 1951 the Government, fearing another attempted
 coup, arrested numerous outstanding Communists and fellow travellers.

 The Party's past experience with the ability of the Indonesian
 Government to curtail overt activity has presumably led it to form an
 underground organization.  However, no details are known regarding the
 size or efficiency of such an organization.  An.elaborate array of front
 organizations and the probable existence of numerous undercover party
 members would seemingly enable the PKI to maintain its structural or-
 ganization and engage in limited activity in the face of Goverment re-
 pression of the Party proper.
 V.  COWUNIST INFLUENCE IN lABO 3
 The number of Communists in key industries is not known but is
 appreciable in view of the strength of PKI dominated unions.
 SOBSI (Sentral Organisasi Buruh Selmruh Indonesia), the trade
 union branch of the PKI, dominates the Indonesian labor movement and is
 an affiliate of the WFTU.  It is represented in the Provisional Parlia-
 ment, where it holds four seats.  SOBSI claims three million members,
 although its actual membership is estimated at about 800,000.  Its largest
 affiliate is SARBUPRI, a federation of estate workers unions which claims
 a membership of one million as against an estimated actual membership of
 350,000.  Other Important SOBSI affiliates exist among ship, dock, rai,
 road, transport, sugar, and oil workers.
 SOBSI's potential for disruptive activities was demonstrated in
 1950 when it spearheaded a campaign of widespread strikes in vital in-
 dustries throughout Indonesia.  Harbor operations, transportation, petroleum
 and some estate rubber production were all brought to a virtual standstill.
 Because of the threat to security, strikes were banned by local military
 commanders in several provinces in late 1950, followed by a nationwide ban
 in February 1951.  In October of the same year the ban was replaced by a
 comprehensive decree calling for a three-week oooling-off period and es-
 tablishing oemunittees of government officials for the compulsory settlement
 of disputes where voluntary mediation failed.  A series of disruptive har-
 bor strikes in March and April 1952 were settled by committee action.  A
 strike of sugar estate workers in mid-1952 was called off only after the
 government threatened to arrest strike leaders.  For the last several months
 there have been no strikes by SOBSI organizations, apparently in response
 to the PKI's avowed policy of cooperation with the goverment.
 Attempts by leaders of various non-Communist parties, particularly
 the Socialist, Labor and Masjiaai parties, to organize non-Communist unions
 capable of challenging SOBSI's domination of labor have been largely mi.-
 successful.                      The lack of capable union organizers and funds and the desire
 of various party leaders to bolster their own political strength have thus

 A.  Front Organizations
 The most important Communist front organizations are described
 briefly below:
 1. .Ikatan Pemuda Peladiar Indonesia (IPPI), Indonesian Youth and
 Students Union.  This group claims a membership of 50,000 to
 75,000, and is second in its field only to the Moslem youth,
 organization.  It is especially influential in the secondary
 schools and is affiliated with the International Students Union.
 2.  Pemba & Mat, People's Youth.  With an estimated membership of
 30,000 this is the most active politically of the numerous
 Indonesian youth groups.  Peruda Rakiat is affiliated with the
 World Federation of Democratic Youth.
 3.  Gerakan Wanita Indonesia Sedar (GERWIS), Enlightened Indonesian
 Woanen&s Movement.  GE14I3 does not possess nearly as extensive
 an organization as the older women's organizations, although it
 is the most active politically.  To date it has been unable to
 influence the national Congress of Indonesian Women to affiliate
 with Women's International Democratic Federation, of which GZIMIS
 is a member.
 4.  .B_arisan Tani Indonesia (BTI), Indonesian Farmers Corps.  This
 group is strongest in Central Java and is represented in
 Parliament.
 5.  kikun Tani Indonesia (RTI), Indonesian Farmers Union.  RTI,
 active in West Java and South Sumatra, and BTI are the two
 most powerful Indonesian farmers organizations.  Plans are in
 the offing for merger of the two groups.
 6.  Indonesian Committee for World Peace.  This organization has
 branches in major cities and appeals to mapy non-Communist in-
 tellectuals.
 7.  Lembaga Kebudaiaan Rakiat (IEERA), People 'a Cultural League.
 Apparently the successor to the Chinese-Indonesian Cultural
 League, this group also has branches in major cities.
 The above groups all serve as instruments for communicating Communist
 propaganda to mass groups, lend their names to the support of Communist .
 causes, attempt to enlist the support of non-Communist groups for Communist

 causes, and participate on behalf of Indonesian women, youth, etc., as
 the case may be, at international Communist conferences.
 Within the Chinese community the most important Communist organiza-
 tion appears to be the Min       She (People's Life Society), incorporating
 a great many womenrs, youth, educational, professional and sports associa-
 tions.             Little detailed information is available concerning its activities,
 but it appears to be the most active organization today among the overseas
 Chinese ooiunity.  When the Chinese Communist Ambassador arrived in Indonesia
 he was greeted by representatives of 180 Chinese associations, which may
 serve as an indication of the complexity of the organization of the Chinese
 community in Indonesia.
 In addition to the above group, perhaps a majority of the Overseas
 Chinese Associations (Chung Hua char, Hui), which have existed since the
 prewar period organized on a regional bas a,, have declared their support
 for the Communist cause.  Many of these have been brought together in a
 series of Communist-dominated United Overseas Chinese General Associations.
 The Chinese schools are a further vehicle for transmitting Communist
 propaganda, and a large number of these are known to be Commmist-dominated.
 A majority of Chinese labor unions are believed to be aff,.liated with SOBSI,
 the overall Indonesian Com9uunist labor organization.  In North Sumatra, at
 least, the Chinese Commmiat Farmers Association is a member of the broad
 farmers front dominated by the Indonesian Communists.
 Few details are available concerning the operations, leadership or
 membership of this array of organizations.  Chinese Communist leadership
 has been active in seizing control of a good many associations whose members
 were apathetic to the political implications of Communist efforts.  In some
 oases comparable non-Communist organizations east, generally organized by
 the KMT, but in general, the Comunist-dominated organizations are predominant
 in the overseas Chinese community.
 B.  Infiltration of Non-Communist Organizations
 The fact that many of the non-Communist mass organizations in
 Indonesia are inclined to the left and have programs that bear a striking
 similarity to those under Communist discipline makes it difficult to dis-
 tinguish all organizations that might properly be included in this category.
 It seems probable that the PKI attempts to infiltrate all such organizations.
 An article in the official organ of the PKI states, "It is the fundamental
 duty of the Communists to give gradual training to all mass organizations
 and to supply them with progressive leadership."  This publication also
 declares, "Every Communist must work hard to unite all kinds of mass or-
 ganizations into one mass organization."  It appears to be the PKI ob-
 jective gradually to merge infiltrated organizations into larger Commmist-
 dominated front groups.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 It is doubtful whether any of the non-rCoffinunist mass organizations
 consciously support Commonuiist programs, but there is often considerable
 agreement between the Communist and non-Communist groups.  The distinction
 between the two groups is often only in the degree of eagerness to take
 sides in international issues and willingness to affiliate with inter-
 national Comamuhist front organizations.
 GOVERTT
 VII.  CNIST INFILTRATION INTO
 A nwnber of Communists are known to hold positions in the Ministry
 of Labor and Information and in their regional offices.  The total number
 of Commnmists and Communist sympathizers in these offices is not known.,
 but the ratio to total personnel is believed to be small.  The arrests of
 August 1951 ferreted out a number of Communists and Communist sympathizers
 in the Ministry of Labor.
 DIalan Baru (The New Roth), often cited as a guide for PKI members,
 declares, "The armed forces must receive special attention as the most im-
 portant instrument of national power. Armed forces cadres and personnel
 must be given special attention in line with their role as the most important
 instrument for the defense of the National Revolution."  Although it is as-
 sumed that the PKI has attempted to infiltrate units of the armed forces,
 little evidence exists to indicate success to date.  There are no known
 Communists or Communist sympathizers at the top levels of the armed forces.
 The same publication further states, "The police and associated personnel
 must learn the meaning of the National Revolution....  The police must be
 led by progressive cadres." Nevertheless, the mobile brigade, national
 police force, is regarded as the most reliable of the Indonesian government
 security forces and there is no evidence of Commmnmist success at subversion.
 VIII.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE ON PUBLIC OPINION FORMATION
 , the national news agency is believed to be influenced by
 either Partai Murba, a so-called "nationalist Camanunist" party, or by the
 PKI,1 and a number of newspapers, avowedly independent, are believed to be
 operated by PKI members or sympathizers.  Nevertheless, the fact that the
 Connmiats advocate many of the same issues that fore part of the programs
 of major non-Communist parties and Coxa nmist publications share many opinions
 with the non-Communist majority of the press makes it difficult to assess
 Comsnunist influence on public opinion formation.  It would seems that the
 influence exerted by the Communists on public opinion media is limited and
 of much less importance than the impact on public opinion of the activities
 of Communist-dominated front organizations.
 1.  Adam Malik, head of Antara is thought to be a member of Partai Murba, but
 the possibility exists that Murba itself is today a PKI front.  In any
 case, attitudes of the two parties on most issues are similar..

 IX.  CCHMUJNIST INFILTRATION OF NON-COMMUNIST POLITICAL PARTIES
 Past experience indicates that attempts at infiltrating all political
 parties are probably made by the PKI.  In.1948, several leading members of
 the Socialist and Labor parties joined the PKI in the Madiun rebellion pro.
 claiming themselves to have been Communists for a number of years.  Little
 concrete information is available, however, to support the above assumption.
 M V1 as, which describes itself as "nationalist .Communist," has
 a program that differs from that of the PKI only in refusing to subscribe
 to a world Communist order.               cannot be described as Titoist or
 Trotskyist, since it acknowledges a position of world leadership for the
 USSR. ?Murba has four seats in Parliament, and has its own series of labor
 unions and front organizations.  Failure of the PKI strongly to attack M rba,
 suggests the possibility that since the death of its founder, Tan Melaka,
 who strongly opposed the PHI, the party may have been infiltrated by PKI
 members.
 X.  _C MIST PROPAGANDA MEDIA
 A.  Newapaners and Periodicals
 Bin    Merah (.Red Star) is the official publication of the PKI.
 Formerly restricted to Party members Bin     Merah is now available to
 the general public, but its circulation is not known.  The most important
 of the other Communist newspapers is Sin g, with a Chinese edition of
 about 20,000 circulation and an Indonesian edition of about 15,000 cir-
 culation.  There are seven other known Communist dailies, none of which
 is believed to have a large circulation.  In addition, a large umber of
 Communist or pro-Communist books and pamphlets are sold at virtually all
 bookstores in Indonesia.
 B.  PubligNM Houses
 B9,ataag MMeeah and all important PKI propaganda publications, in-
 cluding translations of foreign Communist writings, now are published by
 the Jam, aax P    n (Modern Institute) in Djakarta, a corporation in
 which the PKI is reported to have a financial interest.  Jaiaaan PPS
 may have replaced the translating committee  Komiai Penterdiemah) formed
 in March 1951 by members of the Politburo. This committee was charged
 with translating books and essays on Communist theory such as Lenin's
 State and Revolution, and Liu Shaw-chtits On the Part .  Three other
 known        st publishing houses are -the    jaja" publishing house
 and the Life Press Publishing Coampariy, both in Djakarta, and the Hwang
 Lung (Yellow Dragon) Publishing Company in Makassar.
 C.  Cammannist Propaganda from Abroad
 The Soviet magazine     Times and the Soviet novel Star, both in
 English, have been seen on sale in Medan, Sumatra.  Other specific foreign

 Communist publications available in Indonesia are not lawn, but transla-
 tion of Soviet writings is a constant part of PKI propaganda efforts, and
 a great umber of Chinese Communist publications, including textbooks, are
 distributed among both the Chinese and Indonesian commmmi.ties.  .
 The Soviet radio devotes one hour a day and Pei ping radio a half
 hour daily to broadcasts in Indonesian.  The effectiveness of these programs,
 which is difficult to judge, is limited by the fact that only about 230,000
 radio sets are registered in Indonesia.
 II.  FINANCIAL CONDITIC
 Party dues are collected monthly on a sliding scale in proportion
 to income, but do not exceed 1- percent of gross income.  Details concern-
 ing other sources of Party revenues, including possible subsidies from
 abroad are not known.   The PKI has had some difficulty in the past in
 financing its publications, but organizational capabilities of the party
 do not seem to have been hampered by want of funds.  Demonstrations or-
 ganized by the PKI and its affiliates appear well-supplied with posters,
 etc.  It does not appear that the party will suffer in the foreseeable
 future from financial difficulties.
 SOVIET-SATELLITE OFFICIAL ASSETS
 Neither the USSR nor the East European satellites maintain diplo-
 matic missions in Indonesia.  There is a Taos representative and a Czech
 consul-general in Djakarta, however, both of whom are reported to be en-
 gaged in political activity.
 Communist China has an embassy in Djakarta and consulates at
 Surabaya, Makassar, Medan, Banjermasin, and Djogjakarta.  The embassy
 staff is reported limited to fifteen persons, and in July 1951 the Indonesian
 government refused the entry of sixteen additional members.  No details are
 available concerning the consulate staffs.
 In 1951 the Chinese CoDinunist representatives were active in or-
 ganizing demonstrations on the part of the Chinese oamomiunity.  The poor
 reception accorded this activity by many Indonesians has caused greater
 .restraint to be exercised so that the hand of the Chinese Commmist embassy
 in such affairs in the past year has not been obvious.
 There is no Soviet-Indonesian Friendship Association, and the
 Chinese-Indonesian Friendship Association appears to have been superseded
 by the People's Cultural League, the size of which is not known.

 Close relations are maintained by the PKI with the Communist
 parties in the USSR, the Netherlands, and Communist China.  Leaders of
 the PKI have received training in these three countries, and, as noted
 above,. Samsun, one of the founders of the PKI is in Moscow.
 Perhaps the most striking example of compliance with international
 Communist directives took place in 1948.  Indonesian delegates to the
 Congress of the Communist Party of India and the Calcutta Youth Congress
 held early that year reported home the adoption of a policy of armed in-
 surrection.  In September, following also the return of Muso, Samaun's
 lieutenant, from Moscow, the PKI instigated the Madiun rebellion.
 A more recent example of direction from abroad was the criticism
 of SOBSI by WFTU representatives at the 1952 SOBSI national congress for
 not maintaining proper liaison with WFTU international headquarters and
 for failing to report SOBSI activities in sufficient detail.
 Representatives of WFTU and foreign Communist trade unions have
 attended past congresses of SOBSI, and a sixteen man delegation from
 Peiping is known to have been present at the national youth congress held
 in Djakarta in November 1952.  Apart from liaison that is assumed to take
 place at such meetings, it is believed that the Chinese Communist embassy
 is used as a channel of conamication for the PKI.

 FOREWORD
 This paper is one of thirty evaluations of the capabilities
 of Communist Parties in the countries of the free world.  It is di-
 vided into two parts:  (1) an analysis of the objectives, tactics,
 and capabilities of the party; and (2) a compilation of the specific
 "assets" of the party drawn up on the basis of an exhaustive check-
 list provided by the Central Intelligence Agency.
 The first part of the paper focuses on the actual current
 major objectives of the party; the specific tactics employed to
 them out; and the capability of the party to achieve
 assessed in the light of both past and present performance.-
 The second section of the paper is designed to supplement the
 evaluative portion of the paper by both itemizing the organizational
 potential and material assets of the party and, at the same time,
 providing an index to areas of Communist activity where information
 is inadequate, unreliable, or absent.  The data presented in the sec-
 tion on "Assets" should not be treated as definitive; they are rather
 the best available to the Department at the present time.

 CCIMUNISM IN MALAYA:  OBJECTIVES, TACTICS, AND CAPABILITIES
 1.  OBJECTIVES
 Communist guerrillas, 95 percent of whom are Malayan Chinese,
 have been carrying'out hit-and-run warfare against the British and
 their supporters in the Federation of Malaya since mid-1948, when
 the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) and its fronts and labor organiza-
 tions were banned.  Documents captured near the beginning of the
 guerrilla campaign'indioated that the objective of the MCP was to
 drive the British out of Malaya.  This was to be accomplished in
 three successive phases by:
 1)  disrupting the economy
 2)  setting up governments in "liberated" areas
 3)  joining up liberated areas.
 The inability of the party to achieve its first goal --
 disruption of the economy -- in the first three years of the campaign
 has according to other, more recent, captured documents, brought
 about a revision of party policy from one of indiscriminate and un-
 bridled terrorist activity to an attempt to guide guerrilla warfare
 away from activities harmful to the interests of workers and peasants
 and toward military targets.  This move, combined with others, is
 calculated to broaden the base of party support.
 MCP recognition of the necessity for this changed course of
 action has aroused some speculation, unsupported by any evidence,
 that the party, in admitting this initial failure, may also have
 reached the conclusion that it is incapable of achieving its ultimate
 objective through its-own efforts, but must preserve itself as a
 guerrilla force until an outside power can undertake the "liberation"
 of Malaya.
 II.  TACTICS
 During the past six months it has become increasingly apparent
 from the lessened number and changed character of terrorist incidents
 that the MCP, probably in response to progressively more effective
 pressure by British Security Forces, has put into effect its new
 strategic policies.  The MCP's aim -- to gain the support of laborers
 and peasants -- has required modification, rather than abandonment,
 of guerrilla warfare tactics.  A party directive indicates that
 military and police targets may be attacked, but that the destruction
 of dwellings and public utilities, and the seizure of food without
 compensation is to be discontinued.  The destruction of mine and
 estate property is also prohibited, since it affects the livelihood
 of laborers.  Urban organizations, particularly labor unions, are to
 be infiltrated or, if necessary, secret unions formed.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 The MCP's chief guerrilla organization, the Malayan Races
 Liberation Army (MRLA) is estimated to have from 3,000 to 5,000
 members.  Grouped into twelve regiments, the MRLA:usually utilizes
 the company or the platoon as its operating unit.  The MRLA is
 supported by the MIN YUEN, or Peoples Movement, which is
 responsible for furnishing supplies, intelligence, and recruits to
 the MRLA. Rather than a single organization, the MIN YUEN  is a
 collecton,of organizations controlled by party executives for work
 among the masses.  Among the MIN YUEN organizations are groups of
 armed xhen numbering about 4,000, cooperating closely with the
 MRLA.  It is through MIN YUEN organizations that intelligence is
 secured, men recruited, and funds obtained.  While some financial
 support comes from regular contributions by members'of MIN YUEI
 organizations, the bulk of the funds collected apparently comes
 from the "protection" money paid by Chinese businessmen, estate
 owners, and tin mine operators.  The MIN YUEN probably numbers
 upwards of 10,000 members.
 MCP activity capitalizes on anti-British sentiment and, to
 some extent, the economic rivalry between the Malayan Chinese and
 the paramount British economic group.  Since 1949 the nationalist
 character of the party has been stressed in propaganda,, but there
 is little indication that this line has been effective.
 Despite the receipt of one small shipment of arms from
 Thailand, there is no evidence that the MCP regularly receives
 material aid from outside Malaya. 'There is reason to believe,
 however, that some trained leaders have been infiltrated from
 China.  Propaganda circulated covertly by the. party' follows the
 lead of Peiping and Moscow broadcasts for the most part and it
 is likely that these broadcasts serve as one of the chief means
 of liaison between the MCP and'both these Communist centers-.
 III.  CAPABILITIES
 Malaya is not characterized by the existence of either a
 strong unified nationalist movement or depressed economic condi-
 tions that could be exploited by the Communists.  The guerrillas
 do not have widespread public sympathy, and the movement appears
 to be inspired by a hard core of Communists acting in response to
 the policies of international Communism.  The party has sustained
 itself largely by intimidation of the Malayan Chinese community.
 The recent change in the MCP's strategic policy away from wide-
 spread terroristic activity and the intimidation of peasants and
 laborers is in part at least an admission of the failure of this
 course of action.  The effectiveness of new emphasis on gaining

 the support of peasants and laborers, conducting a more selective
 terrorist campaign, and infiltrating labor unions and other
 organizations, cannot yet be evaluated.
 Over the past four years the British, utilizing military
 political, psychological, and socio-economic measures, have
 .successfully contained but have failed to suppress the Communists.'
 In additionto'the difficulties of guerrilla warfare in the jungle,
 the failure of the Malayan Chinese to cooperate in the anti-guerrilla
 campaign, political apathy, and the lack of a Malayan national
 consciousness have contributed to the inability of the British to
 eradicate the guerrillas.
 The diversity of Malaya's population has prevented the
 development of a national consciousness and hampered British attempts
 to arouse an anti-Communist spirit based on nationalism.  The
 largest elements of the population, the Malays (49 percent) and the
 Chinese (38 percent) form separate, mutually antagonistic communi-
 ties.                            Major causes of the friction are the Malay fear of eventual
 domination by the energetic Chinese whom they regard as alien, and
 the Chinese resentment of the favored position traditionally accord-
 ed the Malays by the British.
 In contrast with the non-committal attitude of the Chinese
 toward the present struggle, the Malays support the British,
 forming the bulk of the police and staffing most of the lower
 echelon administrative posts.  Traditionally oriented toward China
 as the Motherland, the Malayan Chinese have sought to preserve
 Chinese culture through their schools and their family life.
 Loyalty to the Motherland is basically cultural rather than political,
 however, and the majority of Malayan Chinese are committed neither
 to the Communist regime in Peiping nor to the Nationalists in
 Taipei.  Apart from a few leaders, political apathy has extended to
 Malayan affairs, the primary Malayan Chinese interest in Malaya being
 commercial.  The Malayan Chinese attitude is also due to the
 emergence of a strong government in China to which the overseas
 Chinese feel that they may eventually be able to look for protection
 of their interests; to the fact that the majority of the Communist
 guerrillas are Chinese; and to the British failure to demonstrate
 clearly the ability to eradicate the guerrillas.  Moreover, the
 Chinese fear local reprisals should they aid the British, or the
 punishment of their relatives or the confiscation of their property
 in China should they openly support an anti-Communist drive.
 The new Communist course of action is likely to pose new
 problems to the British, particularly since the infiltration of
 labor unions is to be attempted.  Nevertheless, it is likely that

 the British, now organized more effectively and imbued with better
 morale under the leadership of Gen. Sir Gerald Templer, will
 continue as during the past year to make slow progress against the
 guerrillas.  It is unlikely, however, that the British will be
 able to wipe out the guerrillas completely; at the same time it is
 .improbable that the guerrillas, without outside aid, can make the
 British position untenable.  The eventual outcome of Malaya's
 Communist problem is-probably to a large extent dependent upon
 events outside Malaya.

 COMMUNISM IN MALAYA: ASSETS
 I. NUMERICAL STRENGTH
 Although more than 15,000 persons, or about 0.3 percent of
 Malaya's population, are controlled or strongly influenced by Communism,
 the MCP itself is estimated to have only 3,000 to 5,000 members drawn
 almost wholly.from the'peasant and laborer class of the Malayan Chinese
 community.  Some 600 to 800 members are estimated to constitute the "hard
 core" of the party and to have been active in the MCP for more than ten
 years.  During World War II, these hard core members took part in the
 British-aided guerrilla organization known as the Malayan People's Axiti-
 Japanese Army.  Probably not more than 1,000 members have been associated
 with the party for more than five years.
 The actual leaders of the MOP are virtually unknown, but from the
 fact of continued guerrilla resistance over the past four years and from
 the statements of surrendered guerrillas it would appear that these
 leaders are determined.,.-aggressive., well-trained men.  Despite the strong
 leadership of the party, however, some of the rank and file members have
 become discouraged at the continual hardships of life in the jungle and
 have surrendered to British Security Forces.  Nevertheless, few of those
 surrendering have been associated with the movement for a long period,
 and it,is probable that the hard core of the party has remained virtually
 intact for the past four years.
 II.  ELECTORAL STRENGTH
 No general elections have been held in the Federation of Malaya.
 The MCP,, banned in mid-1948, has, of course, entered no candidates in the
 few municipal elections that have been held.
 III.  MILITARY STRENGTH AND ORGANIZATION FOR VIOLENT ACTION
 Communist forces are estimated to consist of 3,000 to 5,000
 members of the Malayan Races Liberation Party (MRIA) and approximately
 11,000 armed members of MIN YUEN organizations.  Despite guerrilla
 casualties in surrendered, captured and killed, amounting to half the
 estimated Communist force over the past four years, total guerrilla
 strength continues to be set at a constant level by British sources
 because of steady recruitment by the guerrillas.    Lack of arms apparently
 prevents any expansion of guerrilla forces.
 All Communist support organizations, necessarily covert, are
 blanketed into the MIN YUEN or People's Movement.  It is from these
 organizations that the      receives recruits, funds, food, and

 information. The MIN YUEN has a strength estimated at 10,000 or more.
 MIN YUEN organizations and their functions are: .
 1.  Self Protection Units -- to supply food
 2.  Protection Corps -- to sabotage and ambush
 3.  Armed Work Force -- to propagandize and organize
 I.  District Unit -- to propagandize and organize
 5.  Suicide Squad -- to assassinate reactionary leaders
 6.  Labor Protection Corps -- to lead strikes, to sabotage,
 to propagandize
 7.  Reserve Corps --- to train executives
 8.  Executive Committee of the Masses -- to gather information
 and food
 Sympathizers Cells -- to train prospective party members,
 to gather funds and food, and to act as couriers.
 The guerrillas have employed hit-and-run tactics against police
 stations and villages, ambushed patrols, sabotaged transportation and
 public utilities, and attacked rubber estates and mines.  Newly adopted
 tactics will, according to a captured directive, confine such attacks
 to military; and police targets, or to the property of "reactionary
 capitalists."  In the past, the guerrillas have received support because
 of their ability to intimidate the rural and to some extent the urban
 populations.  However, the recent resettlement of some 400,000 Chinese
 "squatters," who were living on the fringe of the jungle, into controlled
 and protected "now villages" has removed one major source of guerrilla
 support.  Henceforth, the guerrillas must rely more upon Malay villagers,
 estate labor, and urban dwellers.  Whether the newly adopted policy of
 paying for, rather than simply requisitioning food, and of safeguarding
 the interests of peasants and laborers will prove effective in winning
 voluntary'support remains to be seen.
 The guerrillas have been unsuccessful in achieving the economic
 disruption of Malaya, but their tactics have nevertheless affected
 adversely the economies of both Malaya and the United Kingdom. Prospecting,
 on which the future of the tin industry in part depends, has been prevented
 for the past four years.. Rubber trees have been slashed, and a large-
 scale program of replanting made impossible.  Nevertheless, current
 production has not been seriously affected, and it will probably be a
 number of years before Malayan production feels the full affect of the
 present situation.

 The expense of the anti-guerrilla campaign to the Federation
 has prevented the undertaking of needed economic development projects,
 while the expense of maintaining troops in Malaya and of contributing
 to extraordinary expenses of local government has constituted a
 financial drain on the United Kingdom.
 Guerrilla warfare has hampered the rapid achievement of political
 innovations desired by the populace and sponsored by the government as a
 means of encouraging Malayan nationalism as an anti-Communist force.
 Thus, while political progress toward autonomy has been slowed by
 guerrilla warfare, it is the opinion of high-ranking officials that
 political advance is nevertheless imperative if Malaya is to remain
 non-Communist.
 IV.  GOVERNMENT POLICY TOWARD COMMUNISM
 The Government banned the MCP, its fronts,-and its labor organiza-
 tion in mid-1948, when it also adopted Emergency Regulations placing
 extraordinary powers in the hands of the administration.  British Security
 Forces consist of about 10,000 soldiers and 60,000 regular and special
 police.  In addition, a part-time Home Guard of 140,000 has been recruited.
 The Home Guard and most of the special police are employed on static
 guard duty.  In addition to the military campaign, the Government has
 undertaken special measures under the Emergency Regulations, as well as
 broader social, political, and economic steps designed to create a
 climate unfavorable to the growth of Communism.
 By the end of 1952, more than 1400,000 Chinese "squatters" living
 on the edges of the jungle and beyond administrative control had been
 moved to protected "new villages" beyond the easy reach of Communist
 forces that had been intimidating them as a means of getting food,
 funds, and information.  During 1952, as in previous years, several
 thousand Malayan Chinese and a lesser number of Indians were deported
 from Malaya., and additional thousands were detained.  Moreover, in
 several instances entire villages were punished for refusing information
 to Security Forces or ignoring warnings to cease sheltering or feeding
 guerrillas.  Under the Emergency Regulations all inhabitants have been
 required to carry identity cards; carrying arms without a license has
 been made a capital offense; the movement of food has been restricted;
 pro-Communist newspapers have been banned; and the solicitation of
 money or food for the guerrillas has been made a capital offense.  An
 additional important regulation has placed in the hands of a comptroller
 the power to direct any person into the police or military forces or to
 perform any other duty.
 The announced British aim has been to guide the colonial
 territories to responsible self-government within the Commonwealth
 and, as a means to that end, to do everything possible to establish
 the required economic and social conditions.  The Federation Government's

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 efforts in this direction has been given a sense of urgency by the
 belief of high-ranking Federation officials that such measures will
 provide a long term solution to the problem of Communism.  Inter-
 racial harmony is seen as a prerequisite to the development of Malayan
 nationalism, and organizations, including political parties, embracing
 all communities in Malaya have been encouraged.  Local elections have
 been held in several municipalities, while some public members (as
 opposed to government officials) of the Legislative Council have been
 given responsibility for government departments as a first step toward
 cabinet government.  Citizenship provisions have been relaxed to allow
 a much larger number of Malayan Chinese to qualify, and agreement has
 been reached that a certain proportion of Malayan Chinese will be
 allowed in the Malayan Civil Service.  In the field of education,
 regarded as a critical element in "Malayanizing" the Chinese, the
 decision has been taken to establish national schools based on the
 Malay and English languages.
 Economic development, although slowed by the present guerrilla
 problem, has aimed at expanding the national income by improving and
 diversifying agricultural production, encouraging light industry, and
 improving power supply and communication.
 Propaganda measures, both with the guerrillas and with the
 civilian population., have been intensified recently.  Leaflets, posters,
 radio, and mobile public address systems are used.  One of the most
 effective measures has been the use of surrendered guerrillas to recite
 their unfortunate experiences with the Communists to a group of villagers.
 The recent change in tactics by the MCP would seen to indicate
 that measures taken by the Government have, at a minimum, been effective
 in containing the guerrillas.  The party's new tactics, however, will
 force the Government to adopt new methods, particularly since the in-
 filtration of labor unions is to be attempted.  Since police training
 has been directed toward the conduct of operations rather than the
 collection of intelligence it is possible that the new Communist methods
 may achieve some success before being checked by the Security Forces.
 V.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN LABOR
 A policy of encouraging responsible trade unionism was inaugurated
 shortly after World War II in Malaya.  In the early stages, the Malayan
 Communist Party gained control of the labor movement, organized general
 labor unions on a regional basis and finally established a top-level
 executive body known as the Pan--Malayan Federation of Trade Unions
 (PMFTU), which claimed affiliation with the World Federation of Trade
 Unions.  The WFTU was declared illegal in June 1948.  Subsequently,
 many unions rapidly disintegrated and many labor leaders went underground.
 Despite the fact that organized labor remains a Communist target,
 the Federation Government continues to encourage trade unionism as a

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 -9-
 means of developing social responsibility and combatting Communism.
 Under government guidance, trade unions have been rebuilt and a modest
 nucleus of non-Communist unions now exists as a basis for further
 expansion.  A Malayan Trade Union Council,, which was formed in March 1950,
 subsequently affiliated with the International Confederation of Trade
 Unions.
 .  No labor unions in Malaya are known to be Communist infiltrated
 at the present time and no Communist influence on the leadership has
 been observed.  While Communists have forced strikes among rubber
 tappers in certain areas of Malaya, Communist pressure was exerted
 from outside the unions rather than from within.
 VI.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN SOCIAL1 CULTURAL, AND PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 There have been no indications of-Communist influence in social,
 cultural, or professional organizations.  It is highly probable, however,,
 that there has been some Communist infiltration of Chinese secret societies.
 VII.  CO!h&UNIST INFILTRATION INTO GOVERNMENT
 There is no known Communist infiltration into the Government
 of the Federation of Malaya.
 VIII.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE ON PUBLIC OPINION FORMATION
 There is some evidence pointing to the infiltration of the
 faculties of Chinese schools by operatives of the Chinese Communist Party.
 The placement of'pro-Communist teachers in Chinese schools appears to
 have been accomplished at times with the connivance of school trustees.
 Such infiltration appears to be designed not only to spread Communist
 doctrine but to recruit students to go to China for completion of their
 education.
 IX.  COA'IUUNIST INFILTRATION OF NON-COMMUNIST POLITICAL PARTIES
 There is no known Communist infiltration of any of the Malayan
 political parties.
 X.  COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA MEDIA
 Publications of the MCP, usually attributed to various of the
 District Committees,, are mimeographed news sheets circulated clandestinely
 or covertly posted in a public place.  Publications which have appeared
 with some regularity include Freedom News, Workerst    ress, and Workers'
 and Students' News.   The number of copies c rcu a ed  s     own.
 At one time, large numbers of Communist or pro-Communist Chinese
 publications were imported from Hong Kong.  The police, however, have

 now undertaken to prevent such trade, and overt importation has ceased.
 There is presumably some clandestine circulation of such publications.
 XI.  FINANCIAL CONDITION
 No information concerning the financial condition of the 3CP
 is available.
 XII. SOVIET-SATELLITE OFFICIAL ASSETS
 Neither the USSR and its European satellites, nor the Pei-p'ing
 regime, maintain diplomatic, trade, or cultural missions in the Federation
 of Malaya.
 XIII.  COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS          -
 No Communist international organizations maintain installations
 within Malaya, and no conferences of such organizations have been held
 in Malaya.. Communist sources have reported the presence of Malayan
 representatives at meetings of various Communist international organiza-
 tions.                  Since 1918, however, these representatives have been Chinese
 who at one time lived in Malaya.  No representatives have left Malaya
 specifically to attend a particular meeting, or could be said to represent
 any particular Malayan organization.  Many have been deportees.
 XIV.  COMMUNIST COMMUNICATION NETWORK
 The MCP is thought to maintain its closest ties with Communist
 organizations in Thailand, and in Sumatra, Indonesia, and with the
 Chinese Communist Party.  It is assumed that at the present time
 instructions to the MCP are relayed through Pei-piing and Moscow radios,
 which have not only given propaganda support to.the 1CP but have, prior
 to the adoption of a new propaganda line by the MCP, indicated what
 that line should be.
 The beginning of a campaign of violence in 1948, already favored
 by some MCP leaders, was given impetus by the decisions of the Second
 Congress of the Communist Party of India, held concurrently with the
 Calcutta Youth Festival sponsored by the World Federation of Democratic
 Youth and the International Union of Students in early 1948.

 FOREWORD
 This paper is one of thirty evaluations of the capabilities
 of Communist Parties in the countries of the free world.  It is di-
 vided into two parts:  (1) an analysis of the objectives, tactics,
 and capabilities of the party; and (2) a compilation of the specific
 "assets" of the party drawn up on the basis of an exhaustive check-
 list provided by the Central Intelligence Agency.
 The first part of the paper focuses on the actual current
 major objectives of the party; the specific tactics employed to. carry
 them out; and the capability of the party to achieve its objectives
 assessed in the light of both past and present performance.-
 The second section of the paper is designed to supplement the
 evaluative portion of the paper by both itemizing the organizational
 potential and material assets of the party and, at the same time,
 providing an index to areas of Communist activity where information
 is inadequate, unreliable, or absent.  The data presented in the sec-
 tion on "Assets" should not be treated as definitive; they are rather
 the best available to the Department at the present time.

 CC*4MUNISM IN THE PHILIPPINES:  OBJECTIVES, TACTICS, AND CAPABILITIES
 I.   OBJECTIVES
 The leadership of the Philippine Commmmist Party apparently does
 not believe that the situation will favor a drive for immediate power for
 some years to come.   They regard the present period as a preparatory one
 and place main emphasis on organizational and propaganda work.  Their
 principal immediate objectives in rough order of priority, appear to be:
 1.  To win over the masses to the Communist cause.
 2.  To discredit anti-Communist parties and leaders.
 To weaken the close ties existing between the
 Philippines and the US.
 4.  To prevent further dissipation of the party's
 military arm.
 II.  TACTICS
 Although the Philippine Communists consider the workers and the
 landless peasants as the backbone of their movement and plan to concentrate
 their organizational propaganda efforts on them, they are also striving to
 enlist the support of bourgeois groups with a popular front program.  In
 order to facilitate its work of laying a basis for a seizure of power, the
 Philippine Coaamnuiist Party has outlined a program calling for the intensifica-
 tion of what it calls "legal" and "illegal" activities among the masses.
 (Although all Communist activities are illegal in the Philippines and have
 been driven underground, the Communists consider as illegal only their
 military activities and activities directly relating to the support of
 their military arm.)  Their program consists of (1) revival of popular
 front political parties; (2) infiltration of cadres into Government agencies,
 i.e., schools, military forces, into strategic industries, and into or-
 ganizations and groups, i.e., labor unions, peasant organizations, women's
 and youth organizations, etc.; (3) increased indoctrination of the rank and
 file of the movement; and (4) intensification of propaganda activities.
 Party planning apparently envisages the possible negotiation of an amnesty
 settlement with the Government which would enable it to expand its non.
 military activities.  Tactics for the 1953 Presidential and Congressional
 elections seem to call for support to candidates allegedly sympathetic to
 Communism.
 Communist propaganda planning calls for an intensification of the
 "peace" and "national independence" themes.  "Peace" appears designed to
 bring about a weakening of public support for the Government's anti-Communist
 policies in both the domestic and foreign fields.  "National independence"

 will attempt to place blame for all the i31s of the Philippines on US
 policies and US influence on its "puppets" -- the major Philippine political
 parties.  The Communists are charging that US military and economic aid
 programs are disadvantageous to the Philippine masses.  Both themes are
 to be infused into all party activities and, with suitable adaptations,
 directed to all classes of the populace.
 Ccwn unists are using their military arm, the People's Liberation
 Army (HMB), for disrupting Government operations, e.g. assassinations of
 prominent anti-Communists, sabotaging the economy, procuring supplies, and
 as an agency for recruiting the more violent malcontents among the masses.
 At present, however, a policy of conserving H MB strength and limiting its
 operations appears to be in effect.  It may be that in the face of continued
 Government pressures and in order to gain from the Government freedom of
 operation for their organizational and propaganda programs, Philippine
 Communists might further reduce their military activities.
 III.  CAPABIIITIES
 The Philippine Coasnunist Party, which in 1950 was strong enough to
 carry on widespread and well-coordinated armed rebellion, had by 1953 reached
 a low point in revolutionary potential and no longer constituted a serious
 threat to the Philippine Government.  The party's once formidable military
 arm, the IINB, now has capabilities for only small-scale raids and ambuscades,
 while the party is reduced to attempts to infiltrate and organize front
 groups in the face of very severe government repressive measures.  Moreover,
 the party is suffering from a serious shortage of capable executives and
 theoreticians, its organizational apparatus is scattered and harassed by
 increasingly effective Government intelligence' operations, its propaganda
 output is small and distributed with difficulty, and its finances are in a
 precarious state.
 Whether the PKP can again develop sufficient strength to threaten the
 stability of the Philippine Government depends mostly on factors outside the
 control of the PKP.  For the future strength or weakness of the PEP hinges
 on (1) whether or not the Philippine Government continues its strong anti-
 Connnunist programs; (2) whether or not the US can maintain effective eoo--
 noQnic'and military aid to the Philippines; and (3) whether or not the
 Philippine Government increases its efforts to alleviate social and economic
 ills.  In the event of fraudulent elections in 1953 with accompanying civil
 disorders and a loss of popular support for the Government, or the accom-
 modation of one or the other major political parties to amnesty negotiations,
 a situation probably would be created in which short term Communist objec-
 tives and planning could operate with a fair degree of success.  However,
 Commnunist tactics and planning appear to envisage a lengthy period of
 time as necessary before they will be in a position to effectively challenge
 the Philippine Government with a resurgence of their military arm and

 widespread mass support.  With the uncertainties at present threatening
 the continuance of a strong anti-Communist policy on the part of some
 Government leaders, and in the absence of an effective Government reform
 program, it appears that the defensive strategy of the pgp is well suited
 to Philippine conditions through 1953.
 IV.  SUPPLEMFJ.rTTARY DATA ON THE CHINESE CCI4MUNISTS IN THE PHILIPPINES
 Because of excellent security practices, very little information Zs
 available concerning the objectives, tactics, and capabilities of the Chinese
 Commaists in the Philippines. Nevertheless, to judge by their known ac-
 tivities, their objectives include the followings  .
 1.  To gain the loyalty and financial support of the
 .Chinese community -- numbering about 200,000 --
 for the Chinese Communist cause, and, conversely,,
 to subvert and discredit Kuomintang forces in the
 Philippines;
 2.  To construct an effective espionage network;
 3.  In general, to establish a firm mass base for more
 violent revolutionary action in the future, and;
 4.  To support the Philippine Ccnmunist movement in any
 manner which does not jeopardize fulfillment of the
 first three objectives.  Available evidence indicates
 that the Chinese Communists in the Philippines place
 highest priority on the objectives involving the
 Chinese community.
 In order to attain these goals, Chinese Communists employ a variety
 of tactics, including infiltration, some terrorism, and propaganda.  Up to
 now, Chinese Communists have concentrated on infiltration of Chinese or..
 ganizations, particularly secret societies, chambers of commerce, and
 schools.  However, some Chinese Communist infiltration of intelligence
 agencies of the Philippine Government has been reported.  Chinese Commmmmists
 extort contributions from rich Chinese merchants by threats of violence to
 them or their relatives in China.  Some propaganda materials, most of which
 apparently are smuggled into the country, are distributed among the Chinese
 community.
 Apparently, the Chinese Con mists in the Philippines still have
 fairly considerable capacity for future espionage, infiltration, and
 propaganda activities.  The Philippine Goverment round up of Chinese
 Communist suspects in December 1952 evidently did not cause material
 damage to the Chinese Com mmist apparatus in the Philippines.  Nevertheless,

 the Philippine Government and the Kuomintang organization in the Philippines
 are united in opposition to Chinese Communist activity there.  The great
 majority of the Chinese in the Philippines apparently are either anti-
 Communist or politically neutral.            The ability of Chinese Communists in
 the Philippines for forming front groups or labor unions is very limited.

 SECRET - SECURITY I NFORMAT I ON
 COWUNISM IN THE PHILIPPINES:  ASSETS
 1.  NUMERICAL STRENGTH
 The membership-of the Philippine Communist Party (PKP) probably
 numbers about 3,000 to 5,000.  There are about 8,000 to 10,000 Huks,
 the Peoples' Liberation Army or military arm of the PKP, who are not
 PKP members and an estimated 40,000 members of Communist-dominated
 mass organizations.    The number of people influenced by.partial, but
 significant, Communist infiltration of non-Communist organizations is
 unknown., Altogether, Communists and those strongly influenced by
 Communism are estimated to account for 0.2 percent to one percent of
 the total population.  Chinese Communists are estimated to number
 2,000-3,000 but there are no data on the number of members of
 organizations controlled or influenced by them.  PKP membership
 increased from 1946 to 1950 but declined during 1951 and 1952; there
 has been a great increase in Chinese Communist strength since 1946.
 Approximately 90 percent of PKP members and following are located
 in Central and Southern Luzon with the balance in Northern Luzon and
 scattered localities in the Visayas and Mindanao.  The leadership has
 come primarily from Manila, Pampanga, Nueva Ecija, and Bulacan in
 -Central Luzon.  Chinese Communists are primarily in Manila and the towns
 and cities of Southern Luzon, Cebu, and Iloilo.  The bulk of the PKP
 membership and sympathizers are peasants while Chinese Communists are
 primarily merchants, sohool teachers, and administrators.
 Party members are for the most part poorly indoctrinated in
 Communist theory,, have little education, but as a result of continuing
 governmental suppressive action, are probably reduced now to a loyal
 and hard working core.  Morale and discipline among ordinary party
 members is generally good, although some instances of financial dis-
 honesty and sexual profligacy have occurred.  The fanatical well-
 indoctrinated "hard core" probably amounts to 20 percent in the case
 of the PKP and 30 percent for the Chinese Communists.  In the case of
 the PKP, few have been members more than ten years.
 The top leaders of the PKP apparently are not of high caliber
 but the Chinese are of generally good quality.  According to William
 Pomeroy, the American Communist who served with the Huk$ for two years,
 the various leaders displayed poor executive ability, poor ideological
 training, or lack of flexibility.  Taken as a group, the PKP leadership
 has suffered from shortages of good exeoutives,and theoreticians since
 at least 1948.  On the other hand, most top PKP leaders are hard
 working, resourceful, and hardened by the conditions of harassment
 under which they live.  They have close connections with the common
 people and are responsive to their motivations.  For the most part they

 SECRET -- SECURITY INFORMATION
 are fairly young men in their late thirties or forties, and many have
 had only military experience during World War II and afterward as an
 occupational background.
 II.  ELECTORAL STRENGTH
 The Communist Party is not a legal political party in the
 Philippines and cannot run candidates on a ticket of its own.  During
 the last general elections the PKP called for a boycott of the.
 elections.  Chinese Communists in the Philippines apparently do not vote
 and do not have an electoral strategy.
 All political parties in the Philippines receiving votes in the
 last elections are avowedly anti-Communist.
 ? III.     MILITARY STRENGTH AND ORGANIZATION FOR VIOLENT ACTION
 The military arm of the PKP, the Peoples' Liberation Army (HMB)
 or Huks, numbers between 5,000-10,000.  Not all of these are active at
 any one time.  Approximately half are farmers who only occasionally
 participate in Huk raids, ambuscades, etc.  HUB units operate as
 guerrillas with the strength of individual bands'varying between five
 and 100.  They have no heavy weapons but an ample supply of small arms
 in. fair to poor condition.  So far as is known, the HLLB receives nog
 military support from outside the Philippines but may receive military
 advice from China.  However, there is no definite information on the
 number ordutie's of Chinese Communists operating with the HMB.
 Opposed by approximately 23,000 government troops, the HMB
 retains capabilities for small scale raids, ambuscades, kidnappings',
 assassinations,and the dissemination of Communist propaganda.  As a
 result of their depredations, nearly one-third of total government
 expenditures goes to the armed services.  While the HMB does not threaten
 the stability of the government, they nevertheless are a drain on its,
 financial resources, hinder economic development, and tend to disrupt
 the food supply situation.
 HMB strength and activity is concentrated in Central and Southern
 Luzon; their plans for expanding operations in the central and. southern
 islands apparently have been abandoned for the present.  In the face of
 the increased effectiveness of government military action against them,,.
 it is doubtful whether the HMB can expand its activities in the near
 future unless in the event of a fraudulent national election in 1953.
 HUB operations are hindered also by the improved discipline of the
 Philippine Army which has had the result of gaining the cooperation of
 many townspeople and peasants.  While a sizeable number of local
 residents in Central Luzon remain sympathetic with the HMB or are

 fearful, of HMB reprisals, large numbers are now supporting the Army's
 efforts to eliminate HMB activities.  Still, approximately 40,000
 members of PKP mass organizations and Communist sympathizers aid the
 HMB in the collection of intelligence, procure food and recruits, work
 at HMB "production bases" in the Sierra Madres where root crops are
 grown, or act as couriers.  They enable the HMB to sustain its present
 rather low level of activity.
 IV.  GOVERNMENT POLICY TOWARD COMMISM
 The Philippine Government and both major political parties are
 anti-Communist and no overt Communist activities are permitted.  Although
 the PKP has not been outlawed by Congress, in 1951 a Philippine Court
 ruled that the PKP was a seditious and illegal association.  Although
 this decision has been appealed, the Supreme Court probably will uphold
 the lower court's ruling.  In-any event, all PKP members and members of
 auxiliary organizations are subject to arrest.  All front organizations
 are underground and severely hampered by government agencies.  In areas
 of the Philippines where Communists are most active, the privilege of
 the writ of habeas corpus and the right to bail is denied to them.  All
 Chinese Communist activities are also forbidden and individual Chinese
 Communists are subject to deportation to Taiwan on the sole grounds of
 Communist membership.
 Very little is known of the "underground" activities of Filipino
 or Chinese Communists.  PKP organizations apparently are poorly trained
 and organized and with the exceptions of aiding Huks, collecting
 intelligence, and passing on word of mouth propaganda, do not appear
 to be very active.
 During 1951, Communist influence in the Philippine Labor move-
 ment was reduced drastically, and at present there are no Communist
 unions or known significant infiltration of labor unions or key
 .industries:  The possibility of Communist infiltration exists.  Party
 members have been ordered to make lists including all factories, the
 organizational status of laborers and leaders therein, and the problems
 of the laborers.
 VI.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN SOCIAL, CULTURAL,
 AND PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 Communist front organizations apparently have been identified
 by the government and driven deeply underground in the Philippines.
 There appears to be no known significant infiltration of non-Communist
 organizations by Philippine Communists.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Since the suppression by the government of the large front labor
 organizations in 1951, the largest mass organization probably has been
 the National Peasants Union.  It has an estimated 4,000-10,000 members
 located mostly in Central Iixzon and was formerly the largest peasants'
 organization.  For the type of organization it is, it appears to have
 had good leadership, and were the present severe restrictive measures
 of the government to be relaxed, it probably could be considerably
 expanded.
 Two other known Communist mass organizations are the National
 Women's League and the National Youth League.  In 1951, the former
 had a reported membership of 1,500 and the latter 2,200, but again,
 these organizations are underground and very little is known of their
 present activities.
 All known Chinese Communist organizations have gone underground.
 These include the Hwa Chi Comrades Association, the Anti-Japanese and
 Anti-Collaborators League, and the K'ang Fan.  There appears to have been
 a significant infiltration of Chinese Chambers of Commerce in several
 cities and reports indicate a possible infiltration of the leading
 Chinese anti-Communist association -- the Anti-Communist Anti-Soviet
 Salvation Association.
 Present Communist planning calls for the organization and infil-
 tration of various mass organizations -- youth, women, intellectuals,
 etc., but to date there is no indication that they have made significant
 progress with these plans.  From Cavite Province comes a report that a
 ""peace" organization (Katahimikan ng Mahirap - Peace for the Poor) was
 being organized.
 Party theory conceives of two main types of infiltration
 activities:  "legal" and "illegal."  ""Legal" infiltration activities
 consist of working toward a policy-making position within an organiza-
 tion, subtly exerting influence on its policies, and standing-by to
 replace an "illegal" cadre if the latter is arrested.  "Illegal"
 activities include industrial sabotage and recruitment of new members
 for the HMB.  A party member sometimes engages in both types of
 activities simultaneously.
 VII.  COMMUNIST INFILTRATION INTO GOVERNMENT
 There is no known significant infiltration of the government by
 Communists. That some infiltration has occurred was evidenced by the
 court conviction in May 1951 of an official of the Department of Foreign
 Affairs for participation in the Communist rebellion, and in 1952, of a
 Nacionalista Congressman on a similar charge.  There are reports of
 suspected Communist sympathies on the part of fairly prominent

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Administration officials, but these have not been confirmed.  In the
 past there has also been some Chinese Communist infiltration of the
 Military Intelligence Service.
 VIII.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE ON PUBLIC OPINION FORMATION
 There is no known Philippine Communist influence in Philippine
 public -opinion-forming circles, although a few journalists are reported
 to hold views sympathetic to Communism.  There is some Chinese Communist
 penetration of Chinese schools and possibly one radio station.
 IX.  COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF NON-COMMUNIST
 POLITICAL PARTI
 There is no known Communist infiltration of the non-Communist
 Philippine political parties.
 X.  COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA MEDIA
 Current Communist periodicals are the Mapagpalaya (The Liberator),
 Titis (the Spark), and Freedom.  They appear at uncertain intervals and
 none probably has a circulation exceeding 10,000.  They are clandestinely
 mimeographed in several or perhaps all-Party Regions at HMB camps.
 Information on Chinese Communist publications is not available.
 Two publications, Hungary, and The Working Youth in the Rumanian
 People's Republic, have been received unsolicited by individuals in
 Manila and Dumaguete and by the Philippine Education Company.  There is
 no regular importing of Communist publications from abroad, but
 occasionally US Communist Party publications and Chinese Communist
 newspapers are smuggled in, the latter from Hongkong.
 There are no communist radio stations in the Philippines, with the
 possible exception of one station in Manila (the Kuo Tai Station) which
 in October 1952 was organized by an alleged Chinese Communist.  Further
 information on this station is unavailable.  There are no foreign
 Communist broadcasts directed specifically at the Philippines.  The
 reception and size of audience of Peiping's daily 30-minute broadcast
 in English to Southeast Asia or its programs in Mandarin, Cantonese,
 and Amoy dialects to overseas Chinese are unknown.
 X'I.  FINANCIAL CONDITION
 In recent years PKP theoreticians have emphasized the significance
 of finance and supply operations, both of which are called finance in
 PKP terminology.  Data about the actual financial status of the PKP as
 of January 1953 are not available.  Although foreign sources, notably

 10 -
 the US Communist Party and Communist-dominated American labor unions,
 furnished fairly considerable financial aid to the PKP in the prewar
 period, the PKP apparently has received very little material assistance
 from abroad since World War II.  In 1951, the party leadership
 promulgated a "one year program" for the PKP during fiscal year 1952, and
 expected party revenues for this period were budgeted at the fantasti-
 cally high figure of US $4,621,000.  The captured American Communist,
 William Pomeroy, testified in mid-1952 that only "a tiny fraction" of
 this sum was collected.  Party finances in 1952 probably were below those
 during 1950, for example.  The PKP "Statement of Income" for the first
 six months of calendar year 1950 lists total party income for that
 period as US $10,750.  Apparently, the greatest source of income is
 from raids and extortion practices.  (In contrast, according to the
 PKP "Statement of Income," only $28.50 was realized from the sale of
 Titis in the period April-June 1950.)
 ?Data on the income of the Chinese Communists are unknown.  Several
 business firms are controlled by the Chinese Communists, but revenue
 figures from these sources are not available.  Probably'the over-all
 health of the Chinese Communists is better than that of the PKP, in
 view of the generally good financial standing of the Chinese community.
 III.  SOVIET SATELLITE OFFICIAL ASSETS
 There are no Soviet or?satellite establishments diplomatic or
 otherwise in the Philippines.
 XIII.  COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 Since the suppression of the various Communist front organiza-
 tions in the Philippines, there has been no evidence of any affiliation
 of Philippine groups with Communist International Organizations.  There
 are no installations or meetings of these latter within the Philippines
 and no known receipt or transmission of funds to or from them.
 Philippine Communists, however, have attended several Congresses or
 Conferences held abroad.  One Filipino reportedly attended the meeting
 of the International Union of Students in Peiping in 1951, and Teodosio
 Lansang (alias Manuel Cruz) attended the Berlin and Vienna Peace Council
 meetings in 1951 and 1952 respectively, and the Asian and Pacific Peace
 .Conference in Peiping in 1952.  There was no known attendance at, such
 meetings by Chinese Communists in the Philippines.
 XIV.  COMMUNIST COMMUNICATION NETWORK
 The internal communication network of the PKP is a primitive one
 consisting primarily of the use of women couriers.  The Philippine Army
 is supposed to have located the main north-south courier route on Luzon

 which ran down through the Sierra Madres.  Inter-island communication
 is by boat, and here there are infinite possibilities for'the Communists
 to choose.  There are reports that important leaders have radio  .
 receivers and that the Chinese Communists had established a transmitter
 in the Batanes Islands.  Chinese Communists apparently have excellent
 covert communication and courier systems.
 Contacts with the outside, of which China is most important and
 US next, must be clandestinely arranged.  The many islands and the long
 coastline of the Philippines offer many places for couriers-to land.
 There are reports of couriers landing in Manila, Albay Province, and
 various places in the Sulu Archipelago.  Landings from unidentified
 submarines off the east coast of Luton are frequently reported but are
 to date unconfirmed.  Most couriers apparently are Chinese who, after
 their arrival in the Philippines, manage to move about from place to
 place with no great trouble.
 The correlation of some PKP activities with general Communist
 strategy in the Far East possibly is effected at international Communist
 conventions and through couriers, but detailed proof of this is lacking.

 FOREWORD
 This paper is one of thirty evaluations of the capabilities
 of Communist parties in the countries of the free world.  It is di-
 vided into two parts:  (1) an analysis of the objectives, tactics,
 and capabilities of the party; and (2) a compilation of the specific
 "assets" of the party drawn up on the basis of an exhaustive check-
 list provided by the Central Intelligence Agency.
 The first part of the paper focuses on the actual current
 major objectives of the party; the specific tactics employed to carry
 them out; and the capability of the party to achieve its objectives
 assessed in the light of both past and present performance.-
 The second section of the paper is designed to supplement the
 evaluative portion of the paper by both itemizing the organizational
 potential and material assets of the party and, at the same time,
 providing an index to areas of Communist activity where information
 is inadequate, unreliable, or absent.  The data presented in the sec-
 tion on "Assets" should not be treated as definitive; they are rather
 the best available to the Department at the present time.

 COMMUNISM IN THAILAND:.  OBJECTIVES, TACTICS, AND CAPABILITIES
 I.  OBJECTIVES
 The immediate-Coals of the Communists in Thailand are not easily
 discernible at the present moment, since the current vigorous anti-
 Communist drive of the Thai-authorities has presumably forced Communist
 leaders to reconsider their past strategy.
 Before November 10, 1952, the date when the Thai Government
 began its most recent attempt to suppress Communist activity, the imme-
 diate Communist objectives in Thailand appear to have been:
 1.   To expand and improve their own organizations, in preparation
 for the time when domestic events or external assistance might
 make a direct drive for power possible.
 2.   To mobilize all varieties of domestic sentiment against the
 present ruling group.
 3.   To undermine popular support for US policy in Asia and for
 Thailand's pro-American international orientation.
 4.   To render material and propaganda assistance to Communist-led
 rebels in Indochina and Malaya.
 In the current crisis, these objectives have probably been sub-
 ordinated to the overriding need to ensure the survival of key
 personnel.  If the Thai police persevere in-their suppression of overt
 Communist activity, Communist strategy will probably be altered to give
 greater attention to underground organizational work and less attention
 to propaganda activity.
 II.  TACTICS
 Two distinct Communist organizations-have developed in Thailand;
 the Thai Communist Party (TCP) and the Chinese Communist Party in
 Thailand (COP(T)).  The TCP is small and appears to be dominated by
 the larger and better organized COP(T).  Two distinct parties are
 maintained, however, because of the long-standing antipathy with which
 many Thai regard the Chinese and the desire to create the appearance
 of an indigenous Communist movement.
 The CCP(T) has attempted to gain strength by recruiting personnel
 for training, both in Thailand and in China; by soliciting funds for
 local expenses and for transmission to the mainland; by penetrating;
 Chinese schools, labor unions, business organizations, and regional
 associations; and by utilizing newspapers, some of which are subsidized,
 to carry propaganda.

 vote for municipal councilmen); Pernambuco (43,563 or 18.1 percent of
 the total for state deputies); Rio de Janeiro State-(38,399 or 11.8
 percent of the vote for federal deputies);.and Rio Grande do Sul
 (38,759 or 6.1 percent of the total vote for federal deputies).  In
 Sao Paulo State the PCB was the fourth largest party, with about 40
 percent of the vote received by the major party, and 66 percent of the
 vote received by the_ runner-up.  In the Federal District the PCB led
 all other parties in elections for municipal councilmen, with a vote
 more than 20 percent higher than either of its two closest rivals.
 In Pernambuco the PCB was third, with about half the vote received by
 each of the two leading parties.
 III.  MILITARY STRENGTH AND ORGANIZATION FOR VIOLENT ACTION
 Current Communist policy puts considerable emphasis on violence.
 Local party leaders in various parts of Brazil -- especially in Rio
 Grande do Sul, Parana, Santa Catarina, Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais --
 have-in many instances in the past year taken advantage of mass economic
 grievances (rising prices, poor transportation, archaic landholding
 systems) to instigate or assume the direction of strikes, street
 demonstrations, and rural disorders.  Data are not immediately available
 as to the number of people involved in these disturbances, but in any
 single instance the number probably would not surpass several hundred,
 which probably would represent the maximum that the PCB could bring out
 in any locality for violent demonstrations in connection with any current
 issue.
 There is evidence that the PCB is preparing, through organization
 of an "Army of National Liberation", for an eventual insurrection in
 which Communist participation would be more direct and on a broader
 scale.  Reliable detailed information concerning Communist efforts to
 recruit, train, and equip such a force are lacking.  The State of Minas
 Gerais, and especially the strategically located "Minas Triangle"
 bordering Sao Paulo, GoiAs , and Mato Grosso, is generally indicated
 as the main center of insurrectionary preparations.  This region would
 appear to be especially well suited to guerrilla activities designed
 to disrupt Brazilian internal communications and to obstruct the supply
 of Brazilian strategic materials to the United States.  A recent report
 states that Minas Gerais has been supplanted by northern Brazil as the
 .place of emphasis for PCB revolutionary activities.
 Probably not more than 50,000 persons would be available for
 guerrilla assistance to the Soviet Satellites in the event of an East-
 West war.  Leadership would be available from a small number of active
 or inactive commissioned officers of the armed services and a larger
 number of noncomnissionedi officers.  Weapons would be limited largely
 to small arms and explosives, of which the PCB quite likely has enough
 available to permit, for a relatively short period, effective guerrilla
 activity and sabotage in places isolated from main population centers.

 IV.  GOVERNMENT POLICY TOWARD COMMUNISM
 The Brazilian government for seven years has pursued a vigorous
 anti-Communist policy which has been highly effective in some sectors
 but of insignificant result in others.  The PCB was outlawed in 1947
 and all those elected to governmental office on the PCB ticket were
 removed early in 19).8.  The PCB attempted to circumvent its illegality
 by simultaneous attempts to organize new parties as replacements for
 the PCB and to infiltrate or make deals with established parties to
 include Communists on their tickets.  The government has refused to
 register parties organized to substitute for the PCB, and Communist
 efforts to infiltrate political parties and thereby gain entrance to
 governmental bodies have in many instances been defeated by governmental
 or party action to annul candidacies, invalidate elections of Communists
 to office, and remove Communists from party posts.  The PCB has been
 unable effectively to infiltrate any party at the national level and
 its ability to do so at'the state level, though perhaps not at the
 municipal level, appears to have declined since 1948-L9.  The PCB's
 success in achieving and retaining elective office for individual
 Communists likewise appears to have been minimal except in some munici-
 palities.
 The government in general has moved less vigorously and ef-
 fectively against the PCB's press and its front activities.  Here
 governmental policy has been largely one of harrassment and obstruction
 rather than outright suppression, although it has acted to close some
 fronts and other Communist organizations which appeared especially
 threatening to internal security.  The government-has also sought
 actively and with some success to influence public opinion against
 Communist fronts and their propaganda.  Communist ability to gain non-
 Communist allies for their front activities is, together with the
 opposition of some non-Communist political opponents of the admini-
 stration to any measure which might threaten civil liberties, doubtless
 a factor in the government's failure to take drastic action against
 the PCB's press and its front activities.
 The government has given especially close attention to the
 problem of Communists in the labor movement.  Under Dutra and until
 relatively recently under Vargas, the government has kept tight con-.
 trol over labor by intervention of unions, and legal proscriptions
 against voting and holding of labor-union office by Communists.
 Current policy favors greater independence for unions.  Should the
 Communists as a result make any important gain, government action to
 vitiate it would be a reasonable expectation.

 Government action against the Communist underground organization
 has until recently been limited and somewhat haphazard, although the
 police, especially of Rio, Sao Paulo, and Rio Grande do Sul, appear to
 be vigilant and well informed of the PCB's activities.  In the past
 year, and especially in the past few months, the administration has
 moved to break up the Communist; organization in the military and has
 arrested numerous allegedly Communist officers and enlisted men and
 brought them to trial.  Pressure is now building up for similar action
 against Communists in the civil service, where legal considerations
 have thus far been a bar to a thorough anti-Communist purge.
 V.   CCHMIST INFLUENCE IN LABOR
 A.  Key Industries
 According to a mid-1952 report, a majority of the directors of
 the national dockworkers' organization (Sindicato National dos
 Contra-mestres, Marinheiros, Mocos s Remadores em Trans -ones Maritimos)
 were Communists and had succeeded in appointing a Communist delegate of
 the` organization in the port of Santos, a major.shipping center.  A
 negro Communist, Geraldo Rodriguez, who had been on several trips to
 Europe and was in touch with head officials of the international Communist
 labor front, *7U,, was said to be playing a leading part in dockworkers'
 circles in Santos.  Moreover, the Communist directorate of the national
 dockworkers' organization reportedly hoped to appoint Communist delegates
 to the, ports of Belem, Porto Alegre, and Rio de Janeiro in addition to
 Santos. Roberto Morena, Communist federal deputy and labor leader, was
 active in. promoting a dockworkers' strike held in Rio de Janeiro in
 the summer of 1952.
 Communist labor has pockets of strength in the national railroad
 system.  In December 1952, according to the press, Communist labor
 leaders were active among Central do Brasil railway workers in an
 attempt to foment a railroad strike-.
 PCB has had cells in government-operated arsenals.  In the course
 of its anti-Communist campaign, the government discharged a number of
 Rio Naval Arsenal workers accused of Communist membership or ties, but
 there is no assurance that a complete purge has been effected.
 WFTU in December 1951 gave propaganda support to a national
 strike of airline employees and pilots.  The extent of Communist influence
 in national airlines is not known.
 B.  Labor Unions
 Communist strength in the national labor movement is represented
 by the Brazilian Workers' Confederation (Confederagio dos Trabalhadores

 do Brasil, CTB).  The Communist-dominated organization was outlawed
 In 19-47-7but, operating underground, apparently still gives PCB some
 strength in the labor movement. Communist capabilities for organization
 and leadership in some sections of the Brazilian labor movement if
 unchecked, would probably compare favorably with those of independent
 or,government -controlled labor leadership.  Under government repression,
 Communist labor leadership has only limited capabilities to construct
 an organization of its own, but it does have some power to undermine
 non-Communist efforts to gain leadership of the workers.  Thus in
 November 1952 non-Communist labor elements called a meeting to establish
 a National Trade Union Center designed to invigorate the Brazilian labor
 movement.  The Communists took over the meeting and established a
 Permanent Inter-Syndicate Committee (Commissao Inter-Sindical Permanente,
 LISP) with the reported purpose of destroying existing labor organizations
 at their national level and replacing thew with a Communist apparatus.
 Communist influence is probably present to a considerable degree
 in many unions on the national level.  Indeed, leaders of non-Communist
 federations admitted as much in November 1952 when they announced plans
 for an educational campaign within their affiliates to alert the
 membership to both Communist and Argentine efforts at penetration.
 There are only two national unions which recent reports definitely
 indicate are under.strong Communist influence.  These are the dockworkers'
 organization mentioned above and the National Federation of Teamsters
 and Chauffeurs, with its 26 affiliated unions.  In the 1952 union
 elections a Communist sympathizer was elected president, but only 6 of
 the,26 affiliates voted and the legality of the election was challenged
 by the defeated candidate with the support of the Sao Paulo teamsters'
 affiliate.  The outcome of the challenge is not known.
 The strength of Communists in local unions is a subject of
 widely varying estimates.  Trade union elections involving approximately
 200 locals in the federal capital area during the period April-September,
 1952 revealed no overall increase in Communist strength as measured by
 changes made in leadership of the. unions.  Such figures as are available
 on Communist membership of local unions reveal that it is very small,
 but a handful of militant Communists in local trade unions have shown
 ability to agitate the workers, prolonging and worsening strike situations.
 In view of PCB's apparent lack of a widespread, tightly organized
 following in the labor movement, its leaders probably could not hope
 to organize a general strike or even a series of significant strikes.
 The Communist national labor front.. CTB, belongs to the hemisphere
 labor front, CTAL. Roberto Morena, CTB leader, is a member of the CTAL
 Central Committee.  Another Brazilian is a member of the CTAL Secretariat

 in charge of CTAL liaison with the Trades Union Departments of the
 international Communist labor front, WFTU.  Still another Brazilian
 labor leader, Joao Amazonas, was a member of the WFTU Secretariat
 in 1952.
 VI.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN SOCIAL, CULTURAL, AND
 ,'PROFESSIO    ORGANIZATIONS
 There are probably between 500 and 1,000 Communist front
 ,.organizations in Brazil, including local branches of national front
 movements.  The two largest and most widely effective'national.front
 organizations are the Center for the Study and Defense of
 Petroleum and the National Economy (Centro de Estudos e Defesa do
 Petroleo a da Economia  Nacional  and  he National  rganiza  on for
 the  eIense7-of -Peace and Culture (Or aniza ao Nacional de Defesa da
 Paz a da Cultura, sometimes referred  o as the Movimento Brasileiro
 oos Partidarios da Paz) designed to propagate nationalism and
 Isolation sm respectively. These organizations have branches in
 every state, in all important cities, and in many smaller localities.
 The Centro Nacional de Estudos e Defesa do Petroleo, which aims at
 nationalization o  Brazilian petroleum resources and the preservation
 of other Brazilian mineral resources from exploitation by US capital,
 has had much wider appeal than the "peace" movement.  In both cases,
 Rio, Sao Paulo, and Porto Alegre appear to be the main centers of
 strength.  Millions of Brazilians undoubtedly have been influenced
 by the activity of both the "petroleum-defense" and the "peace"
 campaigns, but active participants in these movements, and especially
 the "peace" movement, are relatively few.  In Rio de Janeiro, for
 example, a city of more than two million population, there were,
 fairly recently, only 623 dues-paying members of the local peace
 organization.  Communist or pro-Communist intellectuals tend to
 take the leadership of the peace movement, and Brazilian nationalists
 are especially prominent in the petroleum organization.  A relatively
 small number of Brazilian legislators and government officials
 --
 most of them minor -- are active in one or the other movement on the
 national level.  Members and-leaders in one movement tend to be active
 also in the other.  Present indications are that both the peace and
 the petroleum fronts have reached the peak of their influence, and are
 probably incapable of any substantial expansion.  This is probably
 especially true of.the_peace movement, which both the government and
 the responsible press have combatted vigorously.
 National fronts whose purposes and activities are to propagate
 anti-US nationalist and "peace" propaganda include the National
 Committee against the Brazil-US Military Agreement (Commissio Nacional
 Contra o Acordo Militar Brasil Estados Unidos), the Humanitarian

 Crusade for the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons (Cruzada Humanitaria pals
 P_rohibba2 o das Armas Atomicas), and the League for the Defense of
 Electric Power  Liga de Defesa da Energia Eletrica).  The last-nemed
 organization is active in Rio and other cities in combatting foreign
 control of public utilities.  The Brazilian Association of Democratic
 Jurists (Associa ao Brasileira dos Juristas Democratas), whose activities
 are centered at Rio,de Janeiro, is a national front which has special
 importance internationally, being affiliated with the Communist
 International Association of Democratic Jurists.  The League for the
 Defense of Democratic Liberties (Liga da Defesa das Libertades Democrfiticas)
 is another national front of considerable importance.  All these
 organizations appear to be officered mostly by old-line Communists and
 chronic joiners of Communist fronts and have few important non-Communist
 adherents.
 Among organizations of professionals and intellectuals Communist
 influence is strong and in some instances predominant.  Communists have
 for several years completely controlled the Brazilian Writers' Association
 (Associagao Brasileira do Escritores) of Rio de Janeiro, as a resuot of
 the resignation of anti-Communist members in disgust at Communist tactics
 of fraud and force.  Various state organizations of writers, over which
 the Rio de Janeiro organization pretends to exercise control, are in
 some instances dominated.or strongly influenced by Communists or pro-
 Communists.,  The Communist group among the writers contains some first-
 rate literary men but in large degree appears to consist of pseudo-
 intellectuals and journalistic hacks.  In late 1952 anti-Communist
 literary leaders took first steps toward organizing an anti-Communist
 writers' association.
 . Communist organizations among minority groups are especially
 important among the Poles, who form a sizable colony in southern Brazil.
 The principal Communist organization among the Poles is the Polish
 Communist Party.  There is also a Communist-infiltrated organization,
 the Polish Association.  These organizations are countered by the
 Polish Cultural Union of Brazil, the only national Polish organization
 in Brazil, which works for the defeat of Communism and the liberation
 of Poland.  The small Russian colony's Centro Russe, formed in 1943
 as, a nonpolitical social center, was suspected in early'.1951 of being
 a Russian espionage organ.  Armenian cultural associations in Rio de
 Janeiro and Sao Paulo are reported to be Communist or to contain pro-
 Communists.  The Syrian-Lebanese colony in Belo Horizonte, estimated
 to consist of 250 to 300 members although not known to be formally
 organized, is reported to be the financial backbone of the PCB in
 that city.
 Among students the Communists still exert considerable influence,
 although in the past year or two they have lost control of the national

 organizations representing university students, the National Union of
 Students (Uniao Nacional dos Estudantes) and high school students, the
 Brazilian Union of Secondary Students  Unniiioo Brasileira dos Estudantes
 Secundarios).  The Uniao Nacional dos Estudantes decided in August
 1951 to sever its ties with the International Students' Union, a
 Communist international front; the vote, 2011 to 159, indicated the
 continuance of a strong Communist or pro-Communist minority in the
 organization, although for a year or more the group had been free of
 Communist officers.  On both university and secondary school levels,
 Communists remain in control of some state students organizations.
 Communist strength among students appears to be especially pronounced
 in Sao Paulo.  It is believed that as a general rule Communist influence
 among students as a whole is considerably less than in organizations
 formed to represent the group.
 The outstanding women's organization of political purpose in
 Brazil is apparently the Communist-controlled Federation of Brazilian
 Women (Federa ao das Mulheres do Brasil), believed to have been founded
 about 1949 on Communist initiative.- T his organization, with headquarters
 at Rio, appears to have branches in Sao Paulo, Ceara, Minas Gerais, Rio
 Grande do Sul, Bahia, Pernambuco, and the State of Rio de Janeiro.  It
 may have branches also in other states.  The organization apparently is
 strongest in Sao Paulo.  Delegates attending the first National Women's
 Congress, sponsored by the Brazilian Women's Federation in 1951, are
 reported to have been all Communists.  Women in Brazil tend to be
 politically apathetic.  They are also strongly influenced by the Roman
 Catholic Church.  These factors tend to limit expansion of the Federation's
 influence.
 VII. CO?EMUNIST INFILTRATION INTO GOVERNMENT
 There is no comprehensive detailed information available
 concerning the extent of Communist infiltration of the government.
 .The anti-Communist press has alleged that there are a number of
 Communists in high government positions, including the head of the
 Price Control Commission, the director of the Public Service
 Administrative Department, President Vargas' private secretary, and
 several men in the Brazilian Foreign Office or its diplomatic missions.
 (The Foreign Office is now investigating charges against some of its
 personnel.)  The evidence brought out'against most of these men in
 some instances is sufficient to raise strong doubts as to their
 loyalties, but it is not fully convincing, especially since the
 allegations have come in large part from newspapers interested in
 embarrassing. President Vargas.
 A 1952 report states that there were at that time approximately
 80 militants in the Ministry of Transportation and Public Works; 50
 each in the Ministry of Education and Public Health and the Ministry
 of Justice; 40 each in the Ministries of Agriculture, Labor and Finance;

 13
 and one cell with an unknown number of militants in the Foreign Office.
 These figures, if correct, indicate that percentagewise, the strength
 of Communism in the agencies named is very small.  Evidence to suggest
 the level at which their influence can make itself felt, and how, is
 not available.  In the government-owned shipping company, Lloyd
 Brasileiro, and the nationalized railroad, Estrado do Ferro Central,
 Communist strength was reported in 1952 as being somewhat larger: about
 200 militants and 450 contributing sympathizers in Lloyd Brasileiro and
 150 militants and 200 contributing sympathizers in the Estrado do Ferro
 Central.  A number of reports indicate a fairly heavy infiltration of
 the Federal Service for Protection of the Indians.  Concerning infil-
 tration of police and security services there is only scattered information.
 The low pay and social origins of many policemen would seem to tend to
 make them vulnerable to Communism, however.
 Communist Party membership in the armed services has frequently
 been estimated as about 5 percent at the maximum, with the navy probably
 less heavily infiltrated than the other two service branches.  Member-
 ship is believed to be limited largely to enlisted men and noncommissioned
 officers and to include few, if any, commissioned officers above the
 middle echelons.  According to a report of late 1951 there were 105
 militants in the Ministry of Air, 90 each in the Ministries of War and
 Navy, and 150 militants and 450 contributing sympathizers at the Navy
 Arsenal.  Apparently most of the Communist group at the Navy Arsenal,
 and presumably many of the alleged Communists in the service ministries,
 are civilian employees.  The government recently dismissed a number of
 alleged Communist workers at the Navy Arsenal, and has been arresting
 and bringing to-trial alleged Communist servicemen.
 VIII.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE ON PUBLIC OPINION FORMATION
 There is good indication that Communists and their sympathizers
 are fairly numerous in the fields of education and entertainment
 (including radio) and in the non-Communist press.  For Brazil as a
 whole there are no precise data available as to the number of Communists
 in these activities, and there is no adequate basis for estimating the
 number of people subject thereby to Communist propaganda.
 A 1952 US Embassy report states that key positions in several
 Sao Paulo radio stations (unidentified) are held by Communists, including
 six Communists who are either program directors or station announcers.
 A similar situation is reported with regard to radio stations in Rio de
 Janeiro and Porto Alegre.  In the latter city one of the leading stations
 is directed by a suspected Communist.  Radio Tupi and Radio Difusora
 may be two of the stations reported to be under Communist influence in
 Sao Paulo.
 Communist influence in religious groups is small.  The Greek
 Orthodox Church in Belo Horizonte, composed entirely of Syrians and
 Lebanese, reportedly looks to Moscow for its orientation.

 IX.  COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF NON-COMMUNIST POLITICAL PARTIES
 Except in isolated instances on the local level, Communist
 influence in right-wing organizations and political parties appears
 to be negligible, although the ultranationalism of some members of
 conservative groups sometimes appears to put them in the same camp
 with the Communists.  Left-wing, non-Communist organizations and
 parties are relatively few in Brazil.  The most radical of these
 groups is the small Brazilian Socialist Party, which recently has
 appeared to be under considerable Communist influence.  Other parties
 (such as Vargas' Brazilian Labor Party) offering programs more or less
 leftist in orientation tend to be officered at the top by conservatives,
 although in the lower echelons, and especially at municipal levels,
 there appears frequently to be considerable Communist influence.
 X.  COM1VJNIST PROPAGANDA MEDIA
 Communist Publications
 The Communists publish a fairly large number of newspapers and
 periodicals in Brazil, most of them small in circulation and poor in
 quality.  Total circulation has been estimated at 50,000.  Twenty-six
 Communist publications are listed below according to place of publication.
 In addition the Communists are believed to produce a number of small
 periodicals pointed toward special groups such as labor unions and the
 armed forces..

 B.  Pro=Communist, Disguised Publications
 There are undoubtedly some such publications in Brazil, but
 they would for the most part be of little significance.  Two years ago,
 there were at least two publications of this type in the Federal
 District, one of which was entitled Emancipagao, which appealed to
 Brazilian nationalists interested in preventing foreign exploitation
 of Brazilian petroleum and other mineral resources.  Emancipa ao, which
 may still be published, very soon lost its ncn-Communist disguise.
 C.  Communist Printing Establishments
 Information on Communist printing establishments is scanty.
 Two publishing houses founded by the PCB -- Edigoes Horizontes and
 Editorial Vitoria, in the Federal District -- are known to have
 published until 1917 Russian-language books in Portuguese translation.
 These firms may still be active.  Waldir Duarte, Editor, Livros-
 Revistas-Jornais, of the Federal District, was reported in 1951 to be
 engaged in the publication and distribution of Voz Operaria and other
 Communist publications.  Grifico Luxo Arte ana OZON, also in the Federal
 District, reportedly have   even uuse-T"By -t e PCB to print its propaganda.
 Communist publishing houses in Belo Horizonte are reported to include
 Grafico,Ne tunia and Tipogrtfia Cruzeiro.
 D.  Import of Communist Publications from Abroad
 Soviet newspapers reportedly are not available for public
 purchase but may be obtained by a few select customers at a few book-
 stores or newsstands.  A small number of Soviet publications also
 enters the country by mail on a subscription basis.  Satellite
 publications from Czechoslovakia and especially Poland reportedly are
 received in much larger quantities directly from Europe, in part (at
 least until recently) by diplomatic pouch.  Polish publications are
 believed to have a wide circulation among Slavic groups.  Montevideo
 is reported to be animportant transfer point for import into Brazil
 of some Communist publications from abroad.
 Foreign Communist publications which are reported received in
 Brazil include the Soviet publications Union Sovietica and Mundo
 Es.tudiantil, and the pro-Communist Ukrainian D  ly News, of New York.
 The , ov et publications Tiem os Novo and Literratura  ovietica probably
 also enter Brazil.
 The Moscow radio broadcasts one-half an hour daily in Portuguese
 to Brazil.  The broadcasts are of high intensity and intelligibility,
 but their potential. audience is limited by the fact that they cannot

 be received on standard home radios except those equipped with short
 wave bands.  Soviet programs are not -- or were not in 1951 -
 rebroadcast from any point outside the USSR or within Brazil.  The
 propaganda nature of Soviet broadcasts is completely obvious, and
 they probably have slight if any influence among non-Communist groups.
 X.I.  FINANCIAL CONDITION
 No specific data which would serve to give a general picture
 of PCB revenues and financial assets are available.  The general
 financial condition of the party appears to be shaky.  The printing
 facilities and paper used for Communist publications in most instances
 are poor,and the Communist press is frequently in financial difficulties.
 XII.  SOVIET SATELLITE OFFICIAL ASSETS
 Poland and Czechoslovakia are the only countries of the Soviet-
 Satellite Bloc which maintain diplomatic relations with Brazil.  Their
 missions at Rio de Janeiro are small, consisting of two diplomatic
 representatives in the case of Poland and four in the case of Czechoslovakia.
 Poland maintains a consulate general at Sao Paulo and a consul at Curitiba.
 There is also a Polish consular agent at Porto Alegre.
 Both Poland and Czechoslovakia maintain ostensibly commercial
 enterprises in Brazil.  These firms reportedly contribute to the fi-
 nancial support of the PCB and are also said to operate as centers for
 .espionage.  The commercial firms with Czechoslovakian connections are
 either subsidiaries of Czech state trading organizations bearing similar
 names or are appointed representatives of the state trading corporations.
 The Polish Legation sponsors two known trading organizations.  A third
 such enterprise was established by a represent;:.tive of the Polish Red Cross.
 With regard to propaganda, Polish representatives are much more
 active and influential than are the Czechoslovakians.  Polish consular
 establishments in southern Brazil are especially important centers for
 the distribution of propaganda among the large Slavic population of the
 region.  Polish efforts appear to be directed mainly toward influencing
 Slavic groups.  However, both the Polish Minister at Rio and the Consul
 General at Sao Paulo have also endeavored to promote Polish influence
 among non-Polish Brazilian groups through social and cultural activities,
 as have consular officials in other areas.
 Polish diplomatic and consular establishments print or sponsor the
 printing of a number of publications in Brazil.  These include A Pol6nia
 de Hoje, a monthly publication printed and distributed by the Pol ski -
 mission at Rio; Siewca, a weekly controlled by the Polish mission and

 XIII.  COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 The Brazilian front corresponding to the International Association
 of Democratic Jurists, international Communist front, was host at a
 regional meeting, the Continental Conference of Democratic Jurists of
 America held in Rio de Janeiro in November December 1952.  The meeting
 was attended by Communists and fellow travellers from Argentina, Bolivia,
 Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Guatemala,,and Mexico.
 Attendance of Brazilian delegations at meetings of Communist
 international organizations held abroad was as follows in the period
 1951-52.

 XIV.  COMMUNIST COMMUNICATION NETWORK
 Little is known definitely concerning the nature of the Communist
 international comunications network.  The Czech and Polish missions
 at Rio are available for use in international communications.  The
 Soviet nission at Montevideo also may be important in the international
 communications network of the PCB9 with the large and freely operating
 Communist-dominated S]aric Union of Uruguay possibly serving as an
 intermediary.  Brazilian Communists travelling between Brazil and Europe
 doubtless serve frequently as couriers.  Internally, intercommunication
 between Communists appears to be effected without difficulty.

 FOREWORD
 This paper is one of thirty evaluations of the capabilities
 of Communist Parties in the countries of the free world.  It is di-
 vided into two parts:  (1) an analysis of the objectives, tactics,
 and capabilities of the party; and (2) a compilation of the specific
 "assets" of the party drawn up on the basis of an exhaustive check-
 list provided by the Central Intelligence Agency.
 The first part of the paper focuses on the actual current
 major objectives of the party; the specific tactics employed to carry
 them out; and the capability of the party to achieve its objectives
 assessed in the light of both past and present performance.-
 The second section of the paper is designed to supplement the
 evaluative portion of the paper by both itemizing the organizational
 potential and material assets of the party and, at the same time,
 providing an index to areas of Communist activity where information
 is inadequate, unreliable, or absent.  The data presented in the sec-
 tion on "Assets" should not be treated as definitive; they are rather
 the best available to the Department at the present time.

 COMMUNISM IN CHILE:  OBJECTIVES, TACTICS, AND CAPABILITIES
 I.  OBJECTIVES
 The chief concern of the Chilean Communist Party (Partido
 Comunista de Chile, PCCh) is repeal of the anti-Communist  eeffense of
 Democracy Law of 1948 which seriously restricts the party's ability
 to achieve its other objectives.  These are mainly objectives which
 directly impair US-Chilean relations and by so doing fulfill foreign
 policy requirements of the USSR.  They include (1) abrogation of the
 Mutual Security Agreement (MSA) with the United States, (2),nationali-
 zation of US-owned copper mines, (3) resumption of diplomatic and
 trade relations with the Soviet bloc, and (4) creation of an anti-US
 bloc of Latin American countries as advocated by Chilean nationalists.
 The objective of regaining legal status through repeal of the
 Defense of Democracy Law imposes certain tactical limitations upon
 PCCh efforts to attain its other immediate objectives, counseling as
 it does moderate and constitutional methods of action.  Such consti-
 tutional methods of action are apparently viewed by the Chilean
 Communists as more effective, at least for the time being, than
 violence.
 The underlying strategic policy of the PCCh is to attempt to
 win a direct following among key social groups -- labor, students,and
 intellectuals -  and to use this following to exert pressure upon
 national policy.  Current PCCh strategy is implemented through the
 Communist-led "People's Front", which serves as the political instru-
 ment of agitation for "national liberation" and for the specific
 immediate objectives of PCCh.  Unlike the old Chilean Popular Front,
 this political front is dominated by the Communists and is not a
 major political force.  Communist organizational efforts among the
 key social groups are directed to unifying these groups under the
 'leadership of Communists and Communist sympathizers so that they may
 give strength to the demands of the "People's Front".
 PCCh has not committed its political front to either the new
 regime led by nationalist ex-dictator Carlos Ibanez or to the de-
 feated Radical Party which informer years worked with the Communists
 in the Popular Front.  Although the Communists opposed Ibanez in the
 September 4, 1952 election, they hailed his victory as a defeat for
 the United States arid offered him the conditional support of the
 "People's Front" for a program of "liberation" from US influence.
 They present their political action as designed to offset the in-
 fluence of the rightists on the Ibanez administration and to force

 the administration to keep its campaign promises, which included
 repeal of the Defense of Democracy Law, opposition to US influence,
 and trade and diplomatic relations with all the countries of the
 world.  On the other hand, the Communists are maneuvering into
 electoral combinations with the defeated Radical Party, which has
 been moving left since its fall from power, and they have found
 Radical and other non-Communist allies in labor and student groups
 that oppose Ibanez.
 Long influential in labor, the Communists have used unions
 under their domination as effective instruments to promote their ob-
 jectives.  Their ability to hold together a labor following has
 hinged largely upon their success in settling worker grievances and
 the skill of Communist lawyers in handling involved labor-management
 negotiations.  Communist-influenced unions have brought pressure on
 government officials, have fomented numerous strikes, and have
 staged public demonstrations in favor of such Communist objectives
 as repealing the anti-Communist law.  In its efforts to regain
 legality -, the party has, when possible, avoided taking open leader-
 ship in strikes.  To its labor target PCCh stresses the need of
 unity to prevent government control of labor as in Argentina.
 Communist propaganda to students and youth lays major stress
 on the peace motif.  Emphasizing that in all countries youth is the
 first victim of war, the PCCh endeavors to create a feeling of in-
 ternational youth solidarity by recruiting delegates to international
 Communist-dominated youth conferences and otherwise encouraging a
 spirit of international camaraderie.  Enthusiastic delegates returning
 from such conferences have been widely used to rally new members for
 the PCCh.  The Communists have also used students effectively in
 demonstrations against high prices and the Defense of Democracy Law
 because of government hesitation to use force against student
 demonstrators.
 In addition to labor and student targets, the Communists are
 attempting to influence many other groups through a wide variety of
 Communist fronts, including price-control committees which appeal to
 housewives,' friendship centers for foreign groups in Chile, and clubs
 for artistic and literary groups.
 The Communists developed clandestine methods of operation in
 the period 1948-50 when the Defense of Democracy Law was fully en-
 forced and PCCh still operates clandestinely to some extent.  Its
 underground tactics included attempts to exert influence on labor at
 the lower levels and to continue propaganda operations through a
 range of Communist fronts and clandestine publications.

 SECRET.- SECURITY INFORMATION
 Contacts between the Soviet bloc and Chile are maintained by
 Chilean Communist officials or their trusted sympathizers, who at
 fairly regular intervals visit'the Soviet orbit or exchange views
 with Communist party leaders from other Latin American countries who
 have been to Moscow.    Moscow directs two and one-half hour radio
 programs to Latin America daily, and Budapest an hour program.
 Soviet literature comes into Chile direct from the Soviet bloc or
 from Uruguay, Mexico, and other Latin American countries.  The PCCh
 is believed at the present time to receive little financial aid from
 outside the country.
 III.  CAPABILITIES
 The Communists now face both favorable and unfavorable factors
 in attaining; their objectives.  Favorable factors include the new
 Ibanez administration's support for the repeal of the Defense of
 Democracy Law and the similarity between Communist objectives and
 some of those advocated by Ibanez' nationalistic supporters.  The
 Interior Minister, the Public Works Minister, and the new chief dele-
 gate to the UN have long been sympathetic to certain Communist ac-
 tivities, such as propaganda for "peace", and agitation for greater
 revenues from the US copper companies.  Apparently through their ties
 with the Interior Minister, the Communists have reportedly obtained
 permission to hold a meeting of the Communist-dominated Latin
 American Confederation of Labor (Confederation de Trabajadores de
 America Latina, CTAL) in Santiago in March and a Continental Cultural
 Conference at about the same time.  The new foreign Minister, although
 long.hostile to Communism, is nevertheless a leading advocate of a
 Latin American economic bloc.  The Communists are also having some
 success in interesting the Radicals in the restoration of a Popular
 Front.  The Communist-Socialist candidate in the senatorial by-elec-
 tion of January 4, 1953 received considerable Radical support.  The
 threat of possible government moves toward control of labor has
 played into the hands of the Communists in their efforts to rally
 labor unity against such a development.
 The Communists' greatest recent membership gains have re-
 portedly been among youth groups.  This may stem in part from the
 PCCh success in sending Latin America's most influential delegation,
 including some prominent Catholic student leaders, to the Berlin
 Youth Festival in 1951.  Communist propaganda has also had consider-
 able success among teachers, and the Teachers' Federation shows
 strong Communist influence.  The Communist press is allowed to cir-
 culate freely, and two Communist senators have been permitted to.re-
 main in congress despite the illegality of the party.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 These factors favoring the Communists are balanced and in some
 respects outweighed by unfavorable factors.  In the September 4, 1952
 presidential election, the Communist-supported candidate won only
 52,000 votes out of 900,000 in contrast to Ibanez' huge vote of
 435,000.  The Radical Party and its allies ran well behind the anti-
 Communist right-wing parties.  Ibanez is thus in a strong position
 to curtail Communist activities as he did in his previous administra-
 tion if the party becomes more aggressive.  Ibanez knows that the US
 is Chile's main copper market and its principal source of loans;
 hence, he is not likely to be easily influenced by Communist demands
 that Chile pursue a clear-cut anti-US policy. The Communists also
 face increasing competition in labor, including the growing strength
 of the rival Popular Socialists, who now control the Labor Ministry,
 the expanding influence of the Catholic Falange in the nitrate fields,
 and the new labor confederation-of Ibanezl leading woman supporter,
 violently anti-Communist Senator Maria de la Cruz.  Although the
 Popular Socialists and the Falange might join with the Communists to
 oppose government control of labor, they are well versed in Communist
 maneuvers and would be unlikely to lend themselves to Communist cam-
 paigns in general.  Both parties have at times criticized the US but
 they have been even more critical of the USSR.  Furthermore, the
 Communists have so far been notably unsuccessful in their efforts to
 penetrate the Armed Forces and the national police.
 Although the political-situation in Chile is still fluid under
 the new administration, there seems little likelihood that the
 Communists will attain their immediate objectives, with the possible
 exception of the repeal of the Defense of Democracy Law.  Since its
 election, the Ibanez administration has specifically stated that it-
 does not intend to nationalize copper, abrogate the Mutual Security
 Agreement, or resume relations with the Soviet.  Althou ghsome of
 Ibanez' advisers favor a Latin American economic bloc, Ibanez himself
 has been noncommittal since his election.  If Chile's economic situa-
 tion should deteriorate, however, the administration would be under
 increasing pressure to pursue extremist policies, some of which would
 be favorable to the Communists.

 COMMUNISM IN CHILE:  ASSETS
 I.  NUMERICAL STRENGTH
 PCCh is believed to have about 35,000 members at,thejpresent
 time, or about two-thirds of the membership it claimed in 194? prior
 to the outlawing of the party.  Most Communist membership is located
 in the strategically important mining centers of the north, in major
 urban centers, and in the coal-mining areas.  Labor provides-the bulk
 of PCCh membership although intellectuals, students, and professional
 people are qualitatively as important to the party.
 PCCh has apparently maintained a satisfactory level of organi-
 zation and operation despite membership losses since being outlawed
 in 1948.  The party has carried, out several minor purges in this
 period to tighten party organization and to eliminate members sus-
 pected of weakness or disloyalty.  Dissensions and purges do not seem
 to have lowered the readiness of the party membership that remained
 loyal after 1948 to accept the'party line.  Party leadership is in
 the hands of a predominantly middle-aged "old guard", most of whom
 have had 20 years or more of service in the Communist movement.
 Political Commission members must have at least 10, years as mili-
 tants in the party.  Most of PCCh's 35,000 members have at least
 five years of service in the party ranks.   Party membership dipped
 sharply following the outlawing of PCCh in 1948 and has made some
 slight recovery since 1950, when the party was able to resume more
 or less overt operation.
 II.  ELECTORAL STRENGTH
 The candidate of the Communist-Socialist People's Front
 (Frente del Pueblo) won oily 52,000 votes (5 percent of the total)
 in t e 5 p ember 4, 1952 elections.  Many fellow travellers reportedly
 defected to the victorious candidate, Carlos Ibanez, who made a strong
 appeal to-leftist and mass groups.  In January 4, 1953 by-elections
 for Senator of Santiago Province (national capital and environs),
 the candidate of the People's Front won 68,000 votes ( 33 percent of
 the total).  This area is a center of Communist strength, and the
 Front candidate also had the support of  any members of the major op-
 position Radical Party.  Should the Communists, as is now anticipated,
 regain legal etatus', the Communist-Socialist ticket might be 'able to
 rally 80,000 votes in the March 1953 elections for Congress, or
 approximately 9 percent of the probable total vote.
 The division of the national vote of about 900,000 in the
 March 1953 elections is expected to be about as follows:

 III.  MILITARY STRENGTH AND ORGANIZATION FOR VIOLENT ACTION
 PCCh at present opposes use of armed insurrection or violence
 to effect Communist objectives.  There have been no violent Communist
 demonstrations since April 1949 when 19 or more persons were wounded
 in resisting police action to break up an illegal meeting of several
 thousand Communists and sympathizers in Santiago.  In 1951 three
 party leaders who favored use of violent tactics were expelled from
 PCCh.  Should PCCh revise its policy, which was outlined in a mani-
 festo of August 1952, it is believed that the party could, under cer-
 tain circumstances, bring out four to five thousand demonstrators in
 the capital city of Santiago.  Probably only a fraction of this
 number would be willing to use violence..  PCCh apparently has no
 armed units, but some Communists have collected arms in their homes.
 Police investigation of an explosio. in a Communist workerts home in
 1950 revealed an arms cache of 12 ;machine guns, a number of home-made
 cartridges, and other n ateriel ;
 IV.  GOVERNMENT POLICY TOWARD COMMUNISM
 PCCh was outlawed by the Defense of Democracy Law of September 3,
 1948.  The present administration has promised repeal of the law, which
 might be effected prior to the March 1953 congreosional elections.  In
 the event of Communist disturbances, however, the administration could
 invoke the Law on the Internal Security of the State or request
 special emergency powers which are usually granted.
 For two years after the passage of the 1948 measure outlawing
 PCCh, its activities and ability to circulate propaganda were severely
 circumscribed.  The law aroused strong opposition from non-Communist
 as well as Communist labor because of certain restrictive features
 affecting labor organizations in general, and it has not been strictly

 enforced since 1950.  Communist activity was, in any case, never
 -wholly eliminated because PCCh set up a number of Communist fronts
 1-tnd also continued to wield influence in labor at the shop level of
 labor organizations. Communist propaganda now circulates freely.
 Should the government again undertake measures to curtail PCCh
 activity, the party would no doubt make use of its experience in the
 period 1948-50, when the anti-Communist law was enforced, to carry on
 covert operations and disseminate propaganda through fronts.
 V.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN LABOR
 Communists have been denied union office under Chile's anti-
 Communist legislation and the government made strong efforts in the
 period 1948-50 to stifle all Communist activity in the labor movement.
 These efforts did not succeed, in large part because of the absence of
 effective labor leaders of other parties and the inability of the
 Chilean workers to gain hoped-for unity and effectiveness without the
 collaboration of Communist labor elements.  For a time it appeared
 that the National Association of White-collar' Workers (Junta Nacional
 de Empleados de Chile, JUNECH), a strong and largely non-oomunist
 organization, might point the way toward reorganization of workers on
 aurnified basis independent of Communist influence.  JUNECH, however,
 has recently been working in cooperation with the Communists to form
 a unified organization of white-collar and manual workers.  The degree
 of collaboration of the white-collar unions with the Communist-led
 workers may increase as the two groups find'a common cause in opposing
 a projected government-controlled workers' federation.
 Communist labor leaders are reportedly in virtually uncontested
 control of unions in the nitrates fields and coal mines.  The major'
 copper workers' federation is'anti-Communist, but the Communists con-
 tinue to command a minority following among copper-mine labor.  At
 present the Communists are not believed to have much strength in the
 railway federation or in communications.  If, however, the promises of
 certain government officials to restore to their jobs workers dis-
 charged for political purposes are kept, there may occur a recrudes-
 cence of Communist influence in railway and communications unions.
 There are no reliable figures on the present membership of the
 Communist-controlled Confederation of Chilean Workers (Confederation
 de Traba adores de Chile, CTCh) or on the Communist element therein.
 Ch claims to represent 400,000 manual and white-collar workers, al-
 though,it admits that these workers are not all members of affiliates,.
 of the Communist CTCh.  As the total legal trade-union membership in
 1950 was 262,000 plus another 100,000 government employees and rail-
 road workers in unions without legal status, this claim appears to be
 exaggerated.  Most CTCh affiliates, as the National Mining Federation

 8 -
 (Federacion Nacional Minera) and the National Metallurgical Federation
 ( ed~ erasion Nacional Metal 'gica) are doubtless Communist-controlled.
 Nevertheless, the majoritiyof rank-and-file members probably have
 little real understanding of the meaning of Communism and are.interested
 mainly in the material benefits promised to them by the Communist
 leaders.
 Labor organizations that are not controlled by the Communists,
 but that are strongly influenced by PCCh on the national level, in-
 clude affiliates of the important National Association of White-collar
 Workers (JUNECH).  Estimated membership of JUNECH is about 110,000 and
 includes both government and private employees.  Communist penetration
 of JUNECH affiliates, though probably slight on a numerical basis, is
 significant because of the posts held by Communists.  Thus the JUNECH
 official organ is under the virtual control of a Communist adminis-
 trator and its Communist editor.  The Secretary of Organization and
 the Secretary of Union Problems of the association of white-.collar
 workers in private industry are Communists.  The president of the
 association of government employees, while not a Communist, has be-
 come a complete tool of the  'ommunists.  The teachers' federation is
 reportedly Communist-controlled and if the new governns nt rehires
 teachers dismissed by the previous regime under the Defense of De-
 n cracy Law provisions, Communist strength would be even further aug-
 mented   The president and two of the principal leaders of the semi-
 government workers' federation are Communists.  Thus, while JUNECH
 relatively seldom follows the Communist line as such, its. affiliates
 are very susceptible to'Communist influence.
 The Communists have taken the lead in groups working for a
 nat~on4 labor confederation to include all workers, both manual and
 white-collar and have worked closely with leaders of JUNECH in these
 endeavors.  Strong Communist influence was apparent in the National
 Unifying Movement for Workers, formed in 1950, and the National Com-
 mittee for Workers and Employees, set up in late 1951.  The under-
 lying Communist purpose in encouraging the establishment of these
 committees was to try to unify labor into a central organization
 subject?to-Communist guidance.  A so-called "National Committee for
 Syndical Unity", which includes representatives of all major labor
 groups  was formed in October 1952.  The Communist CTCh is sponsoring
 a meeting scheduled for February 1953 to carry out the objectives of
 this Committee.
 The Communist CTCh is affiliated with the Communist-controlled
 Latin American Confederation of Workers (CTAL) and is represented on
 the CTAL Central Committee.  CTCh is also affiliated with the WFTU and
 the CTCh affiliate, the National Metallurgical Federation, is affiliated
 with WFTU's international trades department in this field.

 VI.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN SOCIAL, CULTURAL,
 AND PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 The PCCh has set up a wide variety of front organizations
 --directed toward youths, women, professional, artists, intellectuals
 and miscellaneous groups that can be interested in the PCCh goals of
 "peace" and friendship with countries in the Soviet bloc.  The largest
 and most influential front group is the Peace Movement (Movimiento
 for la Paz, MPP), which is affiliated with the World Peace Council.
 The size of its membership is not known, but it has branches in all
 the larger cities:.  Its directorate includes not only top Communists
 but also influential non-Communists such as Interior Minister
 Guillermo del Pedregal, MPP president until his recent cabinet
 appointment.  Since the organization has close ties with members
 of the Ibanez administration, its capabilities for expansion would
 appear to be improved.  In addition to the MPP, the PCCh has set up
 additional peace fronts to attract specific groups, including the
 Youth Committee for Peace, the National Committee of Labor Partisans
 for Peace, and the Spanish Committee for Peace.
 Closely allied with the Peace Movement are the various centers
 of "friendship" with nations of the Soviet bloc, such as the Committee
 of Friends of the Soviet Union, three committees relating to Communist
 China, one to Poland, and two each to Czechoslovakia and Hungary.  The
 size of these "friendship" centers is not known, but more than 1,000
 persons attended a function of the Committee of Friends of.the Soviet
 Union on November 7, 1952, the anniversary of the Russian revolution.
 In the group-were members of the Chilean Committee of Friends of
 Czechoslovakia (Comite de Amigos de Checoeslova uia), Friends of
 Hungary Center (Centro de Amigos de Hungar a , Chilean-Chinese
 Cultural Institute  Institute Chileno-Chino de Cultura), Friends of
 Poland Center (Centro    Amigos de Polonia, and other front groups;
 numerous members of the Jewish colony, most of whom are foreigners;
 and many students from the Unitersity of Chile.  PCCh apparently con-
 siders these "friendship" centers a valuable method of attracting non-
 Communists to help promote Soviet international objectives, including
 increased trade between Chile and the Soviet bloc. In some instances,
 an anti-Communist organization has sprung up to rival the Communist
 center.  For example, the Polish Union of Chile and the Czech Union
 are both strongly anti-Communist.
 For Chilean youths, one of the key PCCh targets, the party con-
 tinually organizes new fronts to attract additional non-Communist
 leadership.  Two youth fronts now in the field are the Popular Youth
 Movement (Movimiento Juvenil Po ular) and the Front of Popular Youth
 (Frente de  uventudes  ooppulares , which  have their strongest following

 -10-
 in the cities, particularly the university centers of Santiago,
 Valparaiso, and Concepcion. Although the Communists have hitherto
 been the most active party in the youth field, they are now re-
 ceiving increasing competition from the new Ibanista youth movement.
 Some of the most active Communist fronts have been set up to
 attract artistic and professional groups.  Among these are the Alliance
 of Intellectuals of Chile (Alianza de Intelectuales de Chile, AICh),
 Continental Art Group (Grouo de Arta Continents , "Gebriela Mistral"
 Artistic Society (Con un-to Art!stico "Gabriela Mistral"), Union of
 Painters (Union de  'ntoresxperimentater   eatro Experimental),
 Committee of   mocratic   wwyers (Cornite de Abo ados Democraticos , and
 the Journalists' Cooperative (Cooperati-va de  eriodistas .  The numeri-
 eal size of these fronts is not known.  They are strongest in Santiago
 and other populous centers and they have succeeded in attracting a
 -number of influential non-Communists, including poetess Gabriela
 Mistral, Nobel Prize winner.
 Communist fronts to attract women have not been particularly suc-
 cessful.  The leading Communist front in this field, the Movement for
 the Emancipation of Chilean Women (Movimiento Pro-Emanci~ de la
 Mu erer de Chile, MEMCh), which was originally established to work for
 nationa`1 suffrage for women, is considerably less influential than the
 non-Communist Chilean Federation of Women's Institutions (Federacion
 Chilena de Instituciones Femininas, FECHIF).  The PCCh failure to
 attract women was shown in the presidential election of September
 1952 when the Communist-supported candidate had little feminine sup-
 port in contrast to Ibanez' large following.                   The PCCh continues,
 however, to operate fronts designed to attract women such as the
 Foundation for the Protection of Childhood (Defensa de la Ninez) and
 the National Housing Front (Frente Nacional de la ViviendaT.
 Among minority groups in Chile, the well-established Germans
 in southern Chile are the most important.  They are generally anti-
 Comnunist, and so far as is known no Communist fronts exist for this
 group.  The Yugoslavs, who are widely dispersed in Chile, are also
 preponderantly anti-Stalinist.  Spanish refugees who have entered
 Chile in recent years are usually pro-Communist.  They are active in
 the various "peace" fronts and in the Confederation for Aid to the
 Spanish Democracy (Confederacion de Ayuda a la Democracia Espanola)-
 /A number of Communist fronts have been set up for Jewish residents
 and refugees.  Among these are"the Zionist Federation (federaci6n
 Sionista de Chile), Representative Committee of the Jewish Community
 its Representativo de la Colectividad Isra elita de Chile),
 Maccabi Jewish Sport Club Elub Deportivo Israelita Maccabi),.and the
 Committee for the Protection or '  ewis     Migrantsom     e? Protecci6n
 a los Imigrantes Israelitas).  Many of these, how ever, have their)
 counterpart anti-Communist organization.    One of the more recent PCCh

 fronts is the Chilean-4Iindu Cultural Center (Centro Cultural Chileno-
 Hindu), organized by top Communist leaders for the stated purpose of
 diffusing information on the attributes of Hindu culture.
 Since the PCCh was outlawed, it has set up one front after
 another to agitate for the repeal of the Defense of Democracy Law.
 The most active front in this field at present is the National Executive
 Committee of the Movement for Liberty and Human Rights (Comite
 Ejecutivo Nacional del Movimiento por la Libertad   Derechos Humanos),
 which includes on its directorate such influential non-Communists as
 Clotario Blest, president of the government employees federation.
 The PCCh also attempts to infiltrate non-Communist organizations
 in addition to establishing its own fronts.  Two of the most important
 successfully penetrated are the influential Students Federation of the
 University of Chile (Federaci6n de Estudiantes de Chile, FECh) and the
 Federation of Teachers, both of which frequently lend themselves to
 Communist propaganda campaigns.  At present the Communists appear to
 be infiltrating some of the nationalist organizations such as the
 Committee to Defend the Interests of Chile and Latin America, which
 could readily be used to create difficulties for the United States.
 VII.  COMMUNIST INFILTRATION INTO GOVERNMENT
 Following the outlawing of PCCh in 1948, the Gonzalez Videla
 administration removed most Communists and fellow travellers from
 government positions.  In the present regime of Prewident Ibanez,
 two of the 12 members of the Cabinet are reportedly Communist sympa-
 thizers:  Interior Minister Guillermo del Pedregal and Public Works
 Minister Humberto Martones.  Whether they will stay in office long.
 enough to bring Communists into their ministries in significant num-
 ber remains to be seen.
 The Communists have been notably unsuccessful in efforts to
 gain influence in the armed services at the top level.  The Communist
 youth organization has been instructed to penetrate the armed services,
 but there is no indication that it is succeeding in this mission.  There
 is no evidence of any Communist influence in the police and. security.
 services.
 Communist influence in associations of government employees
 affiliated with the white coller workers federation (JUNECH) indicates
 that there is significant infiltration of the government service, es-
 pecially in the teaching field, at middle and lower levels. With the
 relaxation of the Defense of Democracy Law, which forced many Com-
 munists out of government positions, some Communists have returned.

 VIII.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE ON PUBLIC OPINION FORMATION
 Communist influence is strong in the educational system al-
 though the number of Communist teachers is not known.  The Federation
 of Teachers, the Union of Professors, and the Alliance of Intellectuals
 are Communist-dominated.  The Director of the National Symphony is
 a Communist; the Experimental Theater is highly influenced by Communism;
 and the leading art magazine of Chile, Pro-Arte, is Communist.  The
 important student federation at the University of Chile showed strong
 Communist direction in its latest student election, in which a Communist-
 Radical-Socialist coalition won control of the organization.
 There is no Communist influence in the Church, which, on the
 contrary, is a leading anti-Communist force.  Most of the press and all
 of the radio stations are anti-Communist.
 IX.   COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF
 When the Communists were disenfranchised by the Defense of
 Democracy Law in 1948, many of them infiltrated other parties, including
 even some of the anti-Communist rightist groups.  The Communists have
 very little, if any, influence in the top levels of the rightist parties.
 The parties most seriously infiltrated by Communists were those
 on the left, including the Radical Party, the Falange  and the People's
 Democratic Party.  The Social Christian Conservative 'arty (center)
 also may have been infiltrated to some extent.  The Communists are cur-
 rently trying to interest these parties and the Socialists in forming
 a leftist front.
 Z.  COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA MEDIA
 The principal Communist and pro-Communist newspapers and
 periodicals in Chile (most of which are published in Santiago) with
 estimated circulation, publisher and frequency of publication are as

 Although Chile does not maintain relations with the Soviet
 orbit at the present time, publications of Soviet orbit diplomatic
 missions in Mexico and international Communist fronts, especially the
 labor and peace fronts, are imported in unknown quantity.

 The Communists do not control or influence domestic radio
 broadcasting stations.  Soviet orbit stations broadcast to Chile,
 including daily programs of two and one half hours from Moscow and
 one hour from Budapest.  The broadcasting hours are in the early
 evening and the reception is good. under favorable weather conditions.
 Many Communists are reported to listen regularly, to these programs.
 XI.  FINANCIAL CONDITION
 The size of present party revenues is not known 'In 1948
 PCCh reportedly received three million pesos (about $30,000) from
 membership fees.  There are reported to be some three thousand pro-
 fessionals in the party, each of whom was asked to lend the party
 10,000 pesos (about $100) in 1950, but apparently only a limited
 number complied.  The party also attempts to collect funds by means
 of quotas assigned to its units throughout the country and through
 special fund-raising affairs.
 Few business firms in Chile are Communist-controlled and funds
 from this source are believed to be small.  PCCh, so far as is known,
 receives little financial aid from abroad for operations within Chile,
 with the exception of books sent without charge from Communist pub-
 lishing houses abroad, which are sold to help maintain. the expenses
 of Communist propaganda.
 Before the passage of the Defense of Democracy Law in 1948,
 the party was reported to receive a considerable part of its revenues
 from Communist-controlled unions.  No recent information has been re-
 ceived on its present. revenue from this source.  The party receives
 some revenues from collections regularly made at meetings of Communist
 front organizations.
 Reports on PCCh finances in 1951 indicated that the party was
 in acute financial difficulties.   Concrete reports for 1952 are not
 available, but the party's expanding publications program suggests
 that its financial condition has improved.
 III.  SOVIET SATELLITE OFFICIAL ASSETS
 There are no Soviet orbit diplomatic, trade, or cultural mis-
 sions in Chile.
 The local Communists have organized a Committee of Friends of
 of the Soviet Union (Comite de Amigos de la Union Sovietica) and
 binational "friendship" ocieties relating to China,    gary, Czecho-
 slovakia, and Poland (see section VI).

 Chilean Communists have reportedly been given some financial
 aid in meeting their expenses for travel to the above Communist-
 sponsored meetings, but the amount is unknown.                         The-method of supplying
 funds appears generally to be through payment of passage for delegates
 to the European offices of the transport company involved, and of ex-
 penses -when the delegates arrive in the Soviet orbit.
 XIV.  COMMUNIST COMMUNICATION NETWORK
 PCCh leaders: have at fairly regular intervals gone to Moscow,
 Prague, or Vienna, either individually or as delegates to international
 Communist congresses, and have presumably received instructions from
 international headquarters in person.  International contacts have
 also been supplied via members of other Latin American Communist par-
 ties who have travelled to the Soviet orbit.  Concrete evidence of
 Soviet'instructions to PCCh beyond that indicated above, is not avail-
 able.
 PCCh maintains closest connections with the Communist parties
 of Uruguay, Argentina, Guatemala, Bolivia, Mexico, Peru, and Cuba.
 The Argentine Communist leader, Victor Codovilla, reportedly visited
 Chile recently en route to the All-Union Communist Party Congress in
 Moscow.
