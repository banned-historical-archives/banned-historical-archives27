 LI N PI AO, NEW NUMBER-TWO MAN IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 After months of turmoil within the Chinese Com-
 munist leadership, Defense Minister Lin Piao emerged
 in August as Mao Tse-tung's first deputy in the party.
 In this role he displaced Liu Shao-chi,  long a domi-
 nant figure in the regular party apparatus.   Lin Piao
 is the only leader now described in the Peking press
 as Mao's "close comrade in arms."   An aura of per-
 sonality second only to Mao's has been built up
 around his name, and he is evidently being groomed
 as Mao's successor.
 Lin has risen in spite of a long record of ill-
 ness and absence from public view.   His chief as-
 sets have been his power in the army, Mao's high re-
 gard for him, and Mao's apparently growing mistrust
 of other leaders.   Lin's military background once
 seemed to be a major bar to political advancement in
 a state which stresses party control over the army.
 This factor has become less important now that the
 authority of the party machinery has been downgraded
 with the demotion or dismissal of many of its leaders.
 Lin Piao and the army have been in the center
 of the drive against the   party apparatus.   His
 precise role in this sweeping campaign, however,
 remains unclear.   He may have been merely an in-
 strument of Mao, may have worked with others, or
 may himself have been the prime mover behind the
 purge.   Whether he has developed a strong enough
 personal power base to survive after Mao goes is
 uncertain.  At the moment there is little question
 that he is the dominant leader in the regime af-
 ter Mao.   If Mao's control has slipped badly,  as
 seems conceivable, Lin may already be the dominant
 leader.
 Background
 Lin Piao is considered one
 of China's most brilliant mili-
 tary commanders.   An honors grad-
 uate of the Whampoa Military
 Academy,   he had by the time he
 was 28 won recognition as a
 theoretician on warfare and was
 acknowledged the foremost mili-
 tary strategist in the Chinese
 Communist armed forces.   He
 participated in the Nanchang Up-
 rising on 1 August 1927 which
 marked the birth of the Chinese
 Workers and Peasants'  Red Army,
 and in 1934 he led the vanguard
 Communist troops from central
 China to Shensi on the Long March.
 At the 1937 battle of Ping-hsing
 Pass in Shansi, he defeated the
 crack Itagaki Division and won
 the first major Communist victory
 against the Japanese.   His critique

 of that battle was used as a text
 for instruction.
 In 1942 and 1943 Lin took
 part, with Chou En-lai, in the
 Chungking negotiations between
 the Nationalists and the Commu-
 nists.   After the defeat of Japan,
 with civil war impending, he was
 assigned the crucial mission of
 consolidating Manchuria as a
 base for the conquest of the
 whole of China.
 When the Communists came to
 power in 1949 he was a national
 hero, but poor health seemingly
 kept him from playing a fully ac-
 tive role in the Peking regime.
 He has been absent from public
 life for several protracted pe-
 riods since 1937 and there have
 been official announcements on a
 number of occasions that he was
 ill.
 He was seriously wounded in
 1937 and received treatment in
 the Soviet Union, and on four
 separate occasions between 1950
 and 1954 organizations subordi-
 nate to him sent him "comfort
 messages"--indicating that he was
 then incapacitated.   In 1960 a
 Chinese press statement described
 him as "very weak."
 Lin was
 out of public view from 1950 to
 1956.   He made one appearance
 in 1957, but then numerous ones
 during the next four years.   He
 may have overdone it, because
 his public activity dropped off
 sharply after early 1962 until
 the summer of 19 66 .

 politburo's standing committee,
 the inner circle of Mao's closest
 advisers,  in 1958.   The next year
 he was appointed minister of na-
 tional defense, replacing the
 disgraced Peng Te-huai, and was
 put in charge of the party's
 Military Affairs Committee  (MAC),

 political-military theories of
 "self-reliance," "man over weap-
 ons," and "people's war."   Little
 is known of his own military
 philosophy.   He assumed his top
 military posts at a time of ma-
 jor conflict between Mao and some
 of the army leaders, presumably
 to facilitate strengthening of
 party domination over the armed
 forces.   Under Lin's aegis the
 role of the General Political De-
 partment, the party's arm within
 the military, was greatly en-
 larged and political indoctrina-
 tion was pressed throughout the
 services.
 Lin Piao's name achieved in-
 creasing prominence outside the
 military after a drive was
 started in 1964 to have the whole
 country adopt the army's politi-
 cal indoctrination methods.
 Everybody was told to study Lin's
 instructions on "putting politics
 in command" and studying Mao.
 In September 1965 Lin authored
 a major article setting forth
 Mao's views on global strategy
 and "people's war.'."   Toward the
 end of the year Lin was being
 cited as an authority on intel-
 lectual and cultural policy.
 Throughout this period Lin
 Piao himself remained a shadowy
 figure, seemingly serving as an
 instrument of Mao and lending the
 prestige of his name to reinforce
 Mao's authority.
 Lin Piao's Recent Rise
 It was not until May 1966
 that Lin emerged as a serious
 threat to other leaders.   At that
 time the Liberation Army Journal
 --pointedly identified in May as
 Lin's journal--spearheaded the
 attacks against high party offi?"
 cials who were being brought down
 in disgrace.   Theiusually authori-
 tative central committee journals
 People's Daily and Red Flag fol-
 lowed the army journal's lead
 in that period.   in early May,
 Lin showed up for the first time
 in 12 months, making an appear-
 ance with Mao, party general sec-
 retary Teng Hsiao=ping,  and Pre-
 mier Chou-En-ldi., The order of
 precedence at that appearance was
 Mao,  Teng, Chou,  end Lin,  indicat-
 ing that although; Lin was
 closer to the top power struc-
 ture than before, he did not yet
 stand ahead of too party and gov-
 ernment leaders.
 Lin's standii!iq improved af-
 ter the early May` appearance.  Dur-
 ing May and June he and Mao were
 virtually the onl7 leaders cited
 in the party press as authorities
 on important curr6nt developments.
 However, the time was not
 yet ripe for a mote against rank-
 ing party leaders: such as Liu Shao-
 chi.   During July, both the People's
 Daily and the army journal found
 occasions to indi ate that Liu
 was still a domin4nt party leader
 as well as chief df state.
 A showdown apparently took
 place at the llth. !central commit-
 tee plenum held from 1 to 12 Au-
 gust.   Subsequentlevents indicate
 that the main decision taken at
 the plenum was to 'demote Liu
 out of the inner circle of power

 and to designate Lin Piao as Mao's
 first deputy and heir apparent.
 To achieve this, bargains involv-
 ing Lin, Chou En-lai, and Teng
 Hsiao-ping were probably made.
 Chou retained his number-three
 position, one he has held for
 many years, and Teng, while drop-
 ping to sixth place, was allowed
 to remain in the standing commit-
 tee as head of a weakened sec-
 retariat.
 Since the plenum Lin has
 been consistently represented as
 holding a pre-eminent position
 over Mao's other lieutenants.   He
 is now the only person described
 as Mao's "close comrade-in-arms,"
 an accolade formerly given to Liu,
 Chou, and Teng as well.   Press
 accounts of the three mammoth
 rallies held in August and Sep-
 tember to display the new leader-
 ship lineup described Lin as
 standing "shoulder to shoulder"
 with Mao and speaking in Mao's
 name.
 Several senior military of-
 ficers have been added to the po-
 litburo.    Although no formal an-
 nouncement has been made, the new
 politburo lineup implied by pub-
 lished lists of leaders attending
 the Peking rallies indicates that
 three senior military officers--
 all members of Lin's Military Af-
 fairs Committee--have been brought
 in.   The only military men on the
 previous politburo, besides Lin,
 were the ineffectual Ho Lung and
 Liu Po-cheng.   Six of the 21 mem-
 bers of the politburo now are mil-
 itary men.

 Lin Piao's Views
 Less is known about Lin Piao
 than about any other Chinese
 leader.   There is no large body
 of public writing attributed to
 him and such few works as are
 available--the article on "Peo-
 ple's War" published in Septem-
 ber 1965 for example--are not
 much help in assessing his atti-
 tudes.  As might be expected they
 applaud and echo Maoist doctrine
 at every point, and thus do little
 more than reflect Lin's willing-
 ness to perform the kind of pub-
 lic kowtow that has been neces-
 sary for survival and advancement
 under Mao.
 Lin's contacts with foreign-
 ers have been limited.   The most
 detailed available accounts we
 have of such encounters date from
 the 1930s and, although they pro-
 vide clues about his character at
 that time, they throw little light
 on his present views.  He has never
 been abroad, except for medical
 treatment in the Soviet Union, and
 therefore there is no evidence to
 be derived from recent impressions
 gained by Western observers.
 The scanty  and fragmentary
 information available does, how-
 ever, permit a number of tentative
 conclusions about Lin's outlook
 which suggest the general approach
 he might take toward major ques-
 tions of policy.   These are based
 in the main on what is known about
 Lin before he rose to a position
 of authority at the center of power
 during the mid-1950s and must

 therefore be treated with caution.
 The passage of time and the bur-
 dens of responsibility inevitably
 affect and sometimes profoundly
 alter a man's character.   There
 is no way of knowing with any cer-
 tainty how events of the last
 decade have influenced Lin's out-
 look.
 One thing that is reasonably
 certain, however, is that he re-
 ceived his fundamentally revolu-
 tionary orientation as a young
 man.     He was born just before the
 collapse of the Manchu dynasty in
 1911 and grew up in the ensuing
 period of political ferment during
 which demands for social change and
 newly assertive nationalism grew
 into powerful forces shaping the
 thought of China's youth.
 Lin, the second son of a
 petty landholder who was also the
 proprietor of a small factory in
 the Yangtze valley province of
 Hupeh, was sent to a middle school
 at Wuhan--one of China's first in-
 dustrial centers--in 1921.  While
 at school Lin joined a group known
 as the "Social Welfare Society"
 directed by a man who later be-
 came a prominent propagandist for
 the Chinese Communist Party.   Dur-
 ing his four years in Wuhan, Lin's
 thought probably acquired a basic
 Marxist twist.
 To this was added an impor-
 tant overlay of modern chauvinism
 when Lin was caught up in the May
 30th Movement of 1925 which dwarfed
 all previous antiforeign demonstra-
 tions.  This social convulsion was
 touched off when police in the In-
 ternational Concession in Shanghai
 fired on a group of demonstrators
 protesting against foreign control.
 Strikes, b_oycotts;, and militant
 "anti-imperialist' demonstrations
 --led by student Agitators--erupted
 all over China and continued for
 many months.   There: is no precise
 information concerning Lin Piao's
 role in these events but it is
 clear that he was much influenced
 by them.
 Driven by the thrust of twin
 forces--the thirst for social
 change and the desire to erase
 the humiliation of foreign domina-
 tion--Lin Piao chase a military
 career to realize ;his ambitions
 and entered the Whampoa Academy
 late in 1925.   This school, with
 Chiang Kai-shek as commandant and
 Chou En-lai as director of the po-
 litical department,, produced the
 officers who commanded China's
 armies in the years to come.
 While at Whampoas. Lin learned
 his lessons well.   In 1926 he re-
 nounced his membership in the
 Kuomintang,  Joined the Communist
 Party,        and graduated to command a
 platoon in Chiang's "northern ex-
 pedition" against the warlords.
 When the Kuomintan  and the Com-
 munists split in 1127 Lin Piao
 joined. the Communi.5t forces led
 by Chu Te. From that point he
 rose rapidly--commending a regi-
 ment at 20, a division two years
 later, and the First Red Army
 Group at the age of, 24.
 From then until 1955 when he
 was elected to the Politburo Lin's
 role was primarily that of a troop
 commander, a professional soldier
 occupied with the problems of
 training armies and directing them
 in the field.   In this he became
 a legendary figure.,  No leader in
 a Communist army can be apolitical,

 old revolutionary, one clearly
 still adept in manipulating the

 threading the labyrinth of party
 politics. Although he has repeat-

 propositions, it is doubtful that
 he is entirely in tune with the

 during recent years which insists
 that study of Mao's thought is
 more important than field exer-
 cises in forging a military ma-
 chine--or in coping with any
 similar practical problem.
 His attitude toward the out-
 side world is probably suspicious
 and hostile.   US officials who
 dealt with him in the period just
 after World War II found him an
 evasive and misleading bargainer
 and there is nothing in his record
 since then to indicate any change
 in his approach to the West.   Lin
 probably subscribes wholeheartedly
 to Mao's proposition that the US
 should be despised "strategically"
 and over the long run it is likely
 that he takes even more seriously
 the second part of the "paper ti-
 ger" thesis which enjoins cautious
 respect in tactical situations
 existing today.
 Lin's Future
 The composite picture that
 emerges from all of this lacks
 sharp definition but suggests the
 In each of his major state-
 ments made in August and September
 Lin Piao declared that the main
 task ahead was to bring down ad-
 ditional powerful party figures.
 This indicates both that he feels
 he has some distance to go before
 fully consolidating his position

 and that he has considerable con-
 fidence in his strength.   He has
 many things going for him--Mao's
 trust, the backing of the army,
 the apparent cooperation of Chou
 En-lai and the government appara-
 tus, and the acquiescence of some
 leaders in the party apparatus.
 In the present fluid situa-
 tion, however, Lin's position must
 be considered uncertain.   His
 physical vigor is in question.
 Mao's health and control may be
 slipping.  Whether Lin is strong
 enough to survive without Mao's
 backing, should he die suddenly,
 is also in que~t.ion.  Mao, who
 has recently turned against many
 old comrades, could even turn
 against Lin neat.   In short,  the
 situation is expected to remain un-
 stable until-Mao finally goes and
 Lin--or some other contender--full
 consolidates his position,
