 ON DE-STALINIZATION                                             .
 Pravda's editorial follow-up to the 30 June central
 comma twee resolution issued in defense of de-Stalinization
 indicates that the Soviet party has, for the time being
 at least, closed the debate on the causes and implications
 of Stalinism.  Although reassessmen~.~af Stalinist practice,
 accompanied by a guarded loosening~at certain points in
 the Soviet system; is lik---to continue at a deliberate
 pace, the regime has owe again acted to ensure its strict
 control of the process.  Meanwhile, the most important
 Western Communist parties have commented favorably on the
 30 June resolution.

 New incidents which have taken place on the Israel-
 Jordan border may revive the excitement which prevailed
 in Arab capitals for a few days last week when Jordan's
 leaders announced they expected imminent Israeli ag-
 gression.  The Israeli response to the new incidents
 may be even more bitter than usual, since they follow
 close on assurances from Jordan that King Hussain and
 his chief of staff are doing their utmost to control
 their own forces and avoid what the Israelis would view
 as provocations.  UN secretary general Hammarsk,~old is
 scheduled to return to the area next week.
 THE TITO-NEHRU-NASR MEETING  . . . Page                                        3
 The meeting in Yugoslavia of Tito, Nehru, and Nasr,
 apparently scheduled to begin on i8 July, will bring
 together for the first time these three self -appointed
 champions of the "anti-bloc" nations of the world.
 Preoccupation of each of these leaders with his own
 special interests will probably restrict their field
 of agreement to themes favoring national independence,
 coexistence,.: the peaceful settlement of disputes, and
 the need for disarmament and a ban on atomic warfare.

 The Polish government has reacted to the Poznan .riots
 with a combination of threats and concessions.  The Polish
 United Workers' (Communist) Party and the government are
 in a dilemma as a result of differences of opinion among
 the leaders between the proponents of a more liberal

 On the eve of its 14th congress, scheduled to begin
 on 18 July at Le Havre, the French Communist Party seems
 to have accepted the results of the Soviet 20th Party
 Congress, particularly Khrushchev?s attacks on Stalin
 and the cult of personality.  Despite some continuing
 confusion and indications that Stalinist traditions in
 the French party may die hard, the  r ,

 A number of the Latin American presidents who are to
 meet with President Eisenhower in Panama on 21-22 July
 apparently have plans for requesting economic or polit-

 Kubitschek in connec        his economic development

 There are increasing signs in Burma of discontent
 with the results of the close ties established with
 Communist countries during former premier U Nu's tenure.
 The initial momentum of the Sino-Soviet campaign to

 CAMBODIA'S RELATIONS
 WITH THE SING-SOVIET BLOC
 Cambodian crown prince Sihanouk's policy of closer
 relations with the Sino-Soviet bloc produced on 7 July,
 at the conclusion of Sihanouk's visit to Moscow, a Soviet
 pledge to provide Cambodia "unconditional" economic and
 technical assistance.  While some Cambodian leaders fear
 the consequences of the influx of numerous Communist
 technicians into Cambodia, Sihanouk appears confident
 that he can control Communism internally.  For its part,
 the USSR probably regards the outcome of Sihanouk's visit
 to Moscow as an important step in the x~romotion of its
 aims in Southeast Asia.

 As a result of their gain in the Japanese upper
 house election on S July, the Socialists, supported by
 other leftist elements, now control one third of the
 upper house membership, en?ugh to block government
 plans to revise the constitution in order to legalize
 Japanese rearmament.  The Socialists have attributed
 their increased popular support to the party's anti-
 American policy, which emphasized the Okinawan land con-
 troversy and opposition to both American bases and re-
 armament.
 CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY CONGRESS

 Peiping has announced that the Chinese Communist
 Party will convene its eighth congress on 15 September.
 The last congress met in 1945.  Some 1,000 delegates
 are expected to reaffirm Mao Tse-tung's leading position
 within the regime and to "elect" a new central committee

 Algerian rebel activity has slowed in the north, but
 it has increased in southwestern Algeria along the

 journed without ratifying the West German commercial loan
 to Yugoslavia ar the war claims agreement negotiated in
 March.  Yugoslavia's indignant reaction will probably
 jeopardize West Germany's economic position there.  These
 incidents typify the kind of difficulties Bonn is likely
 to encounter in its relations with o h

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 DEVELOPMENT CF THE SING-SOVIET ALLIANCE  Page 1
 The Sino-Soviet alliance, which was firm in Stalin's
 time, seems to be as firm or firmer under the Khrushehev-
 Bulganin leadership.  In the past two years, the Kremlin
 has helped Peiping to increase its international prestige,
 has continued its aid to the Chinese Communist military
 establishment, and has agreed to enlarge substantially
 its contribution to China's industrialization.  Peiping
 may have adjusted its policy toward Taiwan to fit the
 Soviet aims of avoiding a general war and of engaging
 the West in a long-term competition.  The Chinese are   25X1
 elsewhere in the Far and Near East.
 LATIN AMERICAN ATTITUDES TOWARD US INVESTMENT  . . .
 Latin American dissatisfaction with Washington?s
 emphasis on private rather than government investment
 has notably abated during the past several months.  While
 Ibis dissatisfaction had become less intense following
 the Rio conference of November 1954, it could well re-
 sume its former intensity if measures taken by the United
 States and local economic reforms do not substantially
 increase the flaw of private dollar capital.

 ?N L1E-STALINIZATION
 Pravda's~editorial follow-
 up to tie 30 tune central com-
 mittee resolution issued in de-
 fense of de-Stalinization in-
 dicates that the Soviet party
 has, far the time being at
 least, closed the debate on the
 causes and implications of
 Stalinism.
 Clearly suggesting that
 the party has rested its case
 on the "vivid and precise Marx-
 ian reply" provided by the res-
 olution,  Pravda has shifted
 from defense to reaffirmation
 of basic political premises and
 a statement of the limits be-
 yond which "democratization"
 will not be willingly carried.
 Although reassessment of
 Stalinist practices, accompanied
 by a guarded loosening at cer-
 tain points in the .Soviet sys-
 tem, is likely to continue at
 a deliberate pace, the regime
 has once again acted to con-
 fine the process to a frame-
 work established by itself.

 .duly,   ke the central commit-
 tee resolution, stressed that
 -the basic lines of the Soviet
 system and the party's "Lenin-
 ist principles" were unaffected
 ~~by Stalin's errors.  "In spite
 of the great harm done to the
 party by the cult of the in-
 dividual of J. V. Stalin," the
 editorial asserted, "the party
 created by V. I. Lenin,, backed
 by its local organizations,
 ..never ceased to live a creative
 life."
 In Stalin's late years,
 Pravda continued, in an appar-
 en  reference to the present
 leadership, there was in the
 central committee "an able
 Leninist nucleus of leaders who
 understood correctly the press-
 ing requirements both in the
 fields of home and foreign pol-
 icy.'?  The thread between Lenin
 and the present, it was implied,
 therefore.  is unbroken and the
 principle of the party's con-
 tinuity and infallibility re-
 mains intact.
 There can be no question
 of freedom of the press in the
 Western sense'or of a mufti=
 party system in the USSR, Pravda
 emphasized--thus implying pia
 such proposals have cropped up
 within the country. .They are
 ruled out by the fact that "the
 Communist Party was, is, and
 -will be the one and only ruler
 of thoughts, the one to express
 the ideas and .hopes of the peo-
 ple--the leader and organizer
 throughout the entire struggle
 for Communism."
 Having restated this funda-
 mental principle, Pravda pointed
 to a proper understating of
 "Soviet democracy" with a quota-
 tion from Lenin;  "It is heces-
 nary to learn to merge together
 the turbulent, mass-meeting-like
 democratism of the working class-
 esy  flowing like a spring flood,
 with iron discipline in work,
 with unc~emurring  submission  to
 the will of the individual--
 the Soviet leader--in work.?'
 Meanwhile, the most im-.
 portent Western Communist par-
 ties have commented favorably
 on the 30 June rPSOlution.

 announced they expected an im-

 'CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 12 July 1956
 8 July, when Jordan insisted
 that Israeli troops were mas s-
 ing,. the Israelis repeatedly
 asserted Jordan's fears were
 figments of Arab imagination.
 They invited foreign attaches
 to view Israeli maneuvers on
 9 and IO July, probably to re-
 assure these observers that
 nothing unusual was taking
 place   Foreign Minister Myer-
 son told American officials she
 could explain the crisis only
 in terms of some internal Arab
 maneuvering from which Arab
 leaders wished to distract at-
 tentian,
 Developments in the Arab
 states--the change of army
 staff chiefs in Syria, uncer-
 tainty about future political
 trends in Jordan, and Iraqi
 troop movements--probably had
 much to do with the nervousness
 exhibited by some of the Arab
 leaders.
 THE TITO-NEHRU-NA SR MEETING
 The meeting in Yugoslavia
 of President Tito, Prime Minis-
 ter Nehru,-and President Nasr,
 apparently scheduled to begin
 an 18 July, will bring together
 for the first time all three
 Qf these-self-appointed cham-
 pions of  the  "anti-bloc"  nations
 of the world.
 The preoccupation of each
 of these leaders with his own
 special interests will probably
 preclude agreement on specific
 problems of mutual interest
 .and limit any joint communique
 vmainly to restatements of such
 general themes as the "five
 principles" of peace and coex-
 istence, the need for disarma-
 ment and a ban an atomic weap-
 ons,:-and the settlement of
 disputes by peaceful means
 Even though the excitement
 early in July seems to have
 been a false alarm, the Jorc'a-
 nian response to UN truce chief
 Burns' warning and Burns' own
 views--he told American offi -
 cials he was "frankly alarmed"
 at the Israeli attitude--are
 symptoms of renewed tensions.
 UN secretary general Hammar-
 sk~old, who will again visit
 Jerusalem on 19-20 July, and
 go on to Cairo on 21-22 July,
 will find that much of the ef-
 fect of his mission last April
 has been dissipated, and that
 his fears that he had gained at
 best a temporary truce have
 been Iaraely iustif;A~
 Regardless of the nature
 of the communiqub, however, the
 meeting will be widely inter-
 preted in Asia as further evi-
 denee that the neutralist powers
 -are growing in importance in
 world affairs,  Many former
 colonial countries would prob-
 ably  also be encouraged by an-
 other formal association of a
 European power with the neutral-
 ist views of Asiaa
 One. issue on which all
 three men could probably agree
 is that there has been a major
 change in Soviet thinking dur-
 ing-the past year in the direc-
 tion of political "liberaliza-
 tion" and that Soviet actions
 are genuinely intended to re-
 lieve world tension.  Tripartite

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 AFTERMATH OF POZNAN RIOTS
 The Polish government has
 reacted to the Poznan riots
 with a combination of threats
 and concessions.  The Polish
 United Workers'  (Conununist)
 Party and the government are
 in a. dilemma as a result of
 differences of opinion among
 the leaders between the pro-
 ponents of a more .liberal.
 course for Poland and the
 militant Communists who favor
 repression as a means of con-
 trol.
 Party first secretary
 Och~,b and his followers may
 claim that the Poznan incident
 is sufficient reason to.rein-
 stitute tighter centrals, at
 le2.st temporarily, while the
 faction led. by Premier Cyran-
 kiewicz may propose a contin-
 uation of the liberal policies
 to placate the populace.  Some
 cognizance will have to be
 taken of the views of the
 people, who appear to be en-
 couraged by the uprising and
 may seek redress of their
 grievances with further demon-
 strations.  So fax, the govern-
 ment-has acted relatively
 moderately:
 Concessions have been made
 to the Poznan workers.  The
 -first of four payments, which
 will total 6,50,400 zlotys
 ($1,625,?~O.at-the legal rate
 of exchange) to compensate far
 overtaxation, has been made..
 The government claimed that
 the-tax settlement had ?been
 arranged the day before the
 ricits,
 Two government officials
 have been removed from office,
 either as scapegoats or for
 actual ineptness in handling
 the Poznan workers' demands.
 On ? July, Machine Industry.
 Minister Fidelski and Auto-
 mobile Industry Minister
 Tokarski were relieved of
 their posts and their minis-
 tries combined.  The new Min-
 istry of Machine Industries
 is under former power minister
 Jaszczuk.  Fidelski has been
 cited several times by Radio
 Warsaw as having taken. part
 in negotiations with-the
 Poznan workers  before the
 riots.
 Of the many persons ar-
 rested in Poznan, ten have
 been publicly identified and
 will probably be tried and
 punished for fomentiag the
 riots.  Mass punishments, how-
 ever, are unlikely,
 The .riots are being in-
 vestigated by a special com-
 mission headed by party
 secretary Gierek.  Since
 Gierek is said to be a sup-
 porter of Premier Cyrankiewicz,
 who has assumed a leading role
 in the liberal group, his ap-
 pointment may indicate the
 government intends to follow a

 CURREI~LT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 12 July 1956
 THE FRENCH COMMUNISTS AND. THE
 CULT OF PERSONALITY
 On the eve of its 14th
 .congress, scheduled to, begin
 on 18 July at Le Havre, the
 French Communist Party (PCF)
 seems to have accepted the re-
 sults of the S?viet 20th Party
 Congress, particularly Khru-
 shehev's attacks on Stalin and
 the cult of personality.  De-
 spite some continuing cpnfusion
 and indications that Stalinist
 traditions in the French party
 may die hard, the present lead-
 ership-seems to be maintaining
 its control.
 The French Communists were
 apparently startled by Khru-
 shchev's exposure of, the errors
 of Stalin, and hesitated initi-
 ally to make any comment.
 Following Italian leader Togli-
 atti's sharp attack on the
 method and meaning of the re-
 port, however, the French party
 echoed some of his points in
 milder terms.  Further indica-
 tions of PCF acquiescence ap-
 peared following the Moscow
 .press announcement of a "com-
 plete identity of views" be-
 tween Soviet party officials
 and the French Communist
 delegation that went to b~oscow
 on 26 June for clarification
 of the new line.
 'Major changes in leader-
 ship appear unlikely in the
 near future as a result of the
 new policies..  Secretary Gen-
 eral Thorez' health has re-
 portedly deteriorated recently,
 and it is rumored he may be
 elevated to an honorific post.
 He is said to have re-
 established party discipline
 among the rank and file, and
 his recent claims of having
 tried to avoid personal pub-
 licity may be taken as an at-
 tempt to conform to the new
 line of collective leadership.
 He is said to "continue to
 believe" that-the best chance
 for future success lies in
 close, but better-disguised,
 ties with Moscow.
 As long ago as last spring,.
 there were indications of dis-
 content-among the second eche-
 lon leaders, possibly as a re-
 sult of Pierre Herve's charges
 that the party was doctrinally
 rigid.  At that time, secretariat
 member Servin allegedly pro-
 posed that self-criticism not
 be limited to the USSR, that
 expelled members be given a
 second hearing, and that elec-
 tions to the party's highest.
 bodies be by secret ballot.  In-
 clusion of Servin in the group
 sent to Moscow in late June may
 be an attempt to assuage this
 discontent by broadening the
 base for .policy formation.
 In any-ease, the Stalin..
 issue does not- seem to have
 .weakened the Communist Party
 in France, and it is unlil~ely
 to provoke a major wrangle at
 the party congress, particular-
 ly since strong efforts will
 be made to muffle criticism
 and questioning.   The congress
 is expected to concentrate on
 pressing for unity of action
 with the Socialists, but the
 Communists may have difficulty
 in reconciling this policy
 with its strong stand for im-
 rnediate negotiations in A1-
 geria.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 12 July 1956
 THE  PANAMA MEETING fJF PRESIDENTS.
 A number- of Latin American
 presidents evidently hope- to
 -find an opportunity at the 21-
 22, July meeting; of-chief exec-
 utives of the American republics
 to press requests for economic
 or political assistance on
 President Eisenhower, although
 the agenda makes no provision
 for substantive discussions.
 The unprecedented meeting,. which
 was postponed from 25-26: Jurie
 to permit President Eisenhower's
 attendance, is to commemorate
 the-first step in inter-American
 organization, the Congress of
 Panama of 1$26.
 Bilateral Approaches.
 -__
 Brazil:  The most urgent
 request for aid is expected to
 come from Brazilian president
 Kubitschek, who. did not origi-
 na11y intend to go to the meet-
 ing.  Kubitschek~tald American
 ambassador Dunn on 3 Jnly he
 planned to take up with Presi-
 dent Eisenhower his economic
 program and to explain-the do-
 mestic political problems
 arising from his policies of
 close. collaboration with the
 United States, opp?sition to
 both Communism and extreme na-
 tionalism, and insistence on
 maintaining Brazil's commit-
 ment to export atomic minerals
 to the United States.
 Kubitschek may also expect
 to discuss a US request for
 military sites on the Brazilian
 bulge.  Since it would require
 an extensive effort by his ad-
 ministration to get the Brazil-
 ian congress to approve such
 an agreement, Urazil  is
 requesting a small aircraft
 carrier as a visible quid pro
 quo.
 Panama:  The host govern-
 ment. of Panama may seek to dis-
 cuss its negotiations with the
 United States for radar sites
 connected with projected Nike
 installations in Panama.  Panama
 has consistently obstructed the
 .initiation of surveys for the
 radar sites, denying that ex-
 isting treaties authorize leases
 for these sites.. Panama may
 hope to extract new concessions
 or at least to accelerate US
 action on legislation imple-
 menting the 1955 treaty.
 Chile:- Chilean president
 Ibanez may also plan to dis-
 cuss his economic problems with
 President Eisenhower.  The
 editor of a semiofficial
 Chilean newspaper repprtedly
 stated on 9 June that the
 Chileam president, who has in
 recent months adopted economic
 and financial, reforms long ad-
 vocated by the United States,
 may request President Eisen-
 hower?s intervention in favor
 of a $160,000,000 development.-
 laan which Chile requested
 from the US in 1953.
 Multilateral Approaches
 The Chilean editor also
 stated that all Latin American
 presidents going to Panama
 were doing so in expectation
 of a US announcement of a sub-
 stantial increase in economic
 aid or technical assistance to
 Latin America. .While-this does
 not appear to be a widespread
 feeling, a general discussion
 of US-Latin American relations
 may arise.  Brazil?s support
 for a general discussion of US-
 Latin American economic rela-
 tiaras may be indicated by
 Kubitschek?s statement on 6
 July that he planned to bring
 up the problems of foreign in-
 machiner       ports .                               25X1

 SIGNS OF BURMESE DISCONTENT
 WITH COMMUNIST TIES
 There are increasing signs
 in Burma of discontent with the
 results of the close ties with
 the Communists established dur-
 ing former premier U Nu's tenure.
 Further development of this
 friction in Burma, one of the
 Sino-Soviet bloc"s earliest
 targets-among the neutral na-
 tions, could impair the Com-
 munists' coexistence campaign
 in South and Southeast Asia.
 Past promises of noninter-
 ference in Burmese affairs did
 not prevent the Soviet and Chi-
 nese embassies from liberally
 subsidizing the opposition
 National United Front in the
 April elections.  This meddling,
 which resulted in significant
 gains by the opposition, may
 have played a large part in U
 Nu's decision to resign last
 month.
 On the economic side, the
 Burmese have lately discovered
 that barter trade with the bloc
 is by no means the hoped-for
 panacea for their economic ills.
 They have complained of red tape
 in arranging imports of goods,
 uncertainty of delivery dates,
 and poor quality of items.  U
 Nu openly criticized barter
 deals just before his resigna-
 tion, saying one would have to
 be "crazy to barter rice when
 he could sell it for cash."
 An additional indication
 of a cooling of Burmese rela-
 tions with the bloc is the fact
 that a high-level Burmese trade
 mission that recently departed
 for Europe deleted, at the last
 minute, all Communist countries
 from its itinerary.
 The initial momentum of
 the Sino-Soviet campaign to
 capture Burma's neutralist sym-
 pathies appears to be lost, and
 the Burmese are likely to show
 more sophistication in their
 future dealings with the bloc.
 The Communists, however, can
 be expected to take some steps
 aimed at correcting these points
 of friction.  Promised Soviet
 construction of several impres-~
 sive projects in Rangoon--a
 hospital, a sports center and
 a technological institute--
 should help reduce areas e~
 irritation.

 CAMBODIA'S RELATIONS
 WITH THE SINO-SOVIET BLOC
 Cambodian crown prince        i
 Sihanouk's foreign policy of
 closer relations with the Sino-
 Soviet bloc produced on 7 July
 a Soviet pledge to provide
 Cambodia. with "unconditional"
 economic  aiYd  technical  assist-
 ance..,. A point communique'.
 issued in Moscow also spoxe of
 strengthening political and cul-
 tural ties between the- two
 countries and announced a
 Soviet gift of a hospital, com-
 plete with equipment, for
 Phnom Penh.
 Sihanouk, head of a delega-
 ian that included Premier Khim
 Tit and National Assembly chair-
 man Oum Chheangsun, left little
 doubt during his seven-day visit
 to-the USSR that, despite his
 "permanent" resignation from
 public office  last  March.,  he re-
 mains  the  architect of  Cambodian
 policies.  The visit was marked
 by Soviet praise of Cambodia's
 neutralism and its successful
 "evasion" of Western military
 blocs; Sihanouk reciprocated by
 lauding the USSR's progress.,
 t;aod will and dedication to world
 peace.  A basic reason for
 Sihanouk's effusiveness--evident
 in his statement that Cambodia's
 national interests are dependent
 on "sincere, claw  and fraternal.
 relations with the Soviet anion"'
 --apparently lies in his con-
 viction that by obtaining-the
 USSR's public commitment to the
 "five  principles"  of  peaceful  co-
 existence in .its relations with
 'Phnom Penh, Cambodia's security
 would be guaranteed,
 Tconomilc Aid
 According to the Moscow
 commun~:que, Soviet and Cambodian
 experts will meet soon in Cam-
 bodia to develop "practical" ways
 to implement the economic and-
 cultural ties between the two
 countries.  In this connection,
 the-USSR expressed ifa readiness
 to send technicians to train
 Cambodian personnel-and to
 provide industrial equipment.
 This agreement follows closely
 the conclusion of a $22,400,000
 Chinese Communist economic aid
 agreement. with Cambodia, and,
 there is a possibility that
 assistance may also be forthcoming
 from Poland.
 Sihanouk. hopes this Commu-
 nist aid, in conjunction with
 Western assistance, will enable
 Cambodia to fulfill an ambitious
 two-year economic development
 plan designed to make the
 country econarnically independent
 by 1957.  While some Cambodian
 leaders fear that Communist
 technicians will engage in sub-
 versive activities in Cambodia,
 Sihanouk apparently remains
 confident that he can control
 Communism within Cambodia's
 borders.
 For its part, the USSR--
 which recently expressed its
 readiness to establish diplamatie
 relations- wi1;h Laos--probably
 regards the outcome of
 Sihanouk's visit as an im~-
 portant step in the promo-
 tion of neutralism in South-
 east Asia.     A  further  oppox?-
 tunaty to expand Soviet in-
 fluence in the area will actor
 during the as-yet-unscheduled
 visit to Cambodia, at
 Sihanouk's invitation, of
 Bulganin, Khrushchev and

 JAPANESE SOCIALISTS SCORE GAINS
 IN UPPER HOUSE ELECTION
 As a result of their gains
 in the Japanese upper house
 elections on $ July, the So-
 cialists, supported by other
 leftist elements, will Control
 for another three years one
 third of the upper house member-
 ship, enough to block govern-
 ment plans to revise the consti-
 tution in order to legalize
 Japanese rearmament.  The gov-
 erning Liberal-Democratic Party,
 however, continues to retain
 control of the chamber by a
 simple majority with the support
 of the Ryokufukai ("Green
 ;Breeze").  The Socialists have
 attributed their increased popu-
 lar support to the party's anti-
 American policy which emphasized
 the Okinawan ,land controversy
 and opposition to both American
 bases and rearmament,
 The composition of the weak
 upper chamber does not affect
 the tenure of the administration,
 since questions of confidence
 are the prerogatives of the
 lower house.  The Socialist gains
 in the House of Councilors,
 nevertheless,-are a serious set-
 back to-the government,.  The
 Hatoyama administration not only
 will be unable to undertake a
 revision of the constitution,
 but will be further handicapped
 by  its  loss  of  prest~,ge.
 The government party will
 need to impose stronger disci-
 Aline on the rank and file than
 in the past if it hopes to push
 its legislative program past the
 strengthened Socialist opposi-
 tion.  The poor conservative
 showing at the polls may also     ~
 encourage dissident factions
 within the party to increase
 their efforts to wrest the party
 leadership from the Hatoyama
 group.
 The primary reasons for the
 Socialist gains, not only in
 urban areas but also in the
 traditionally conservative
 :rural areas, appear to be popu-
 lar opposition to rearmament,
 the furor over the Okinawan
 land dispute, and general dis-
 satisfaction with continued
 conservative factionalism. -The
 failure of the conservative
 "Green Breeze" to elect an ap-
 preciable number of its candi-
 dates and the complete shutout
 of the pro-Communist Labor-
 :E'armer Party indicate a polar-
 izing of popular strength between
 the two major parties to the
 disadvantage of the minor parties.

 The Chinese Communist
 Party's last congress, meeting
 in Yenan before Communist power
 was consolidated on the Chinese
 mainland, elected a  7?-man
 central committee, which has
 been reduced to 68 by the
 death  of five members and the
 dismissal of two for incompe-
 tence and two others for "anti-
 party" activity.  Many of the
 remaining members apparently
 have no power in the regime.

 to be considerably larger be-

 creased from 1,200,000 to more

 PEIPING PREPARES NEW MOVE
 FOR CLOSER TIES WITH NEPAL
 A treaty between Communist
 China and Nepal dealing with
 commercial and economic matters
 will be negotiated at Katmandu
 "in a few. months."  Preliminary
 arrangements far these negotia-
 -tions were apparently discussed
 prestige with a diplomatic
 triumph and to consolidate their
 control of the conservative
 party.
 The agenda of the congress.
 will include (1) a report on
 the work of the central com-
 mittee since 1945, (2) a report
 on the revision of the party
 constitution, (3)  a  directive on
 the Second Five-Year Plan (1958-
 62), and (4) the "election" of
 a new central committee.  The
 members of 'the new committee will
 of course have been picked pre-
 viously by the top leadership.
 In addition, Chou En-lai has
 reported that opposition to
 "right-leaning conservatism"--
 i.e., a more moderate approach
 to socialism--will be the central
 question at the congress.
 It seems probable that a
 show of "democracy" will be made
 at the congress; the People's
 Daily has said that t e~'party
 is eager to develop "criticism
 and self-criticism."  A recent
 press announcement that Italian
 Communist Party boss Togliatti
 will be in China in September
 suggests that he had perhaps

 Algeria
 The tempo of guerrilla
 activity in rural northern
 Algeria has slowed considerably
 since the large-scale sweeps
 carried out in early June by
 the greatly strengthened French
 forces.  The rebels, whose
 losses have been heavy, appear
 to be more on the defensive than
 at any time in recent months.
 Except for occasional hit-and-
 run forays by small bands,
 guerrillas generally.-stay under
 cover in their mountain hide-
 outs.
 The increase in rebel
 attacks on French desert out-
 posts, particularly along the
 Moroccan-Algerian border,- sub-
 stantiates reports that some
 nationalist elements are moving
 west and south.  At the same
 time, indiscriminate terrorist
 attacks in the large northern
 urban centers have increased.
 As yet, such attacks remain
 sporadic and have not reached
 serious proportions.
 Morocco
 A potential threat to the
 sultan's authority appears re-
 duced by the integration into
 the royal army of important
 northern elements of the ir-
 regular "Army of Liberation.''
 Other former resistance fight-
 ers, spurning integration now,
 are reportedly moving southward
 toward the ill-defined frontier
 region of the Sahara, where
 Moroccan nationalists have an-
 nounced extensive territorial
 claims on Algeria.
 The increased number and

 provided that the status of
 France's forces in Morocco
 would remain unchanged until
 a basic defense relationship

 in Paris are seeking to re-

 is concluded soon, there may
 be serious trouble, possibly

 between French troops and the

 Meanwhile; the Moroccan
 government is ready to press
 for the opening of bilateral
 negotiations with the United
 States regarding the status
 of the five American air bases
 in Morocco,  The Moroccan for -
 eign minister has formally re-

 texts of the 1950 French Ameri-
 can agreements, which France  --
 had-agreed to furnish it some

 withholding this information.
 in an attempt to bolster-its
 position during economic and
 financial negotiations with
 the Moroccans,.
 On 6 July the secretary
 general of the French Foreign
 Ministry asked for an American
 commitment not to offer mill-
 Lary aid to either Morocco or
 Tunisia, and implied that the
 texts of the 1950 agreements
 would be withheld until a com-
 mitment'.is received.  Such a
 commitment, which would only
 be useful to France if "leaked"
 to the Moroccans, would in the
 opinion of the American charge
 in Rabat adversely affect the
 American position in Morocco.
 Tunisia
 The antagonism and sus-
 picion underlying French-Tuni-
 sian relations, particularly
 concerning Tunisian sympathy
 for the. Algerian nationalists,
 flared this-week when the French
 government strongly protested
 an Arab-language broadcast of
 1 July by Radio Tunis support-
 ing the Algerians.  The Tunisian
 government rejected the protest.
 Negotiations under way in
 Paris on defense and foreign
 policy seem to be marking time.
 French officials' hopes that
 the issue of a defense agree-
 ment will "quietly die" within
 the next few weeks appear un-
 likely to be fulfilled.  The
 Tunisians continue to press
 strongly far complete military
 evacuation of Tunisia.  A com-
 mitment to evacuate, even over
 a long term, does not seem likely
 in view of the strategic im-
 portance to France of its ex-
 tensive naval facilities
 at Bizerte.-and the unresolved
 Algerian-rebellion:

 MOLLET'S CONCESSIONS WIN FRENCH
 ASSEMBLY'S SUPPORT FOR EURATOM
 Premier Mollet has won a
 342-183 vote of approval in-the
 National Assembly for French
 participation in the drafting
 of a six-power EURATOM treaty.
 Some of his support, however,
 was won by extensive concessions
 to nationalist opponents of
 European integration, who ob-
 jected in particular to and
 effective limitation of France's
 rights to develop nuclear weap-
 ons,  These concessions leave~in
 doubt the question of whether a
 treaty acceptable to the other
 five nations will be ratified by
 the French assembly.
 From the start of the
 debate, Mo31et was faced with
 -the absolute hostility of the
 Communists and the Poujadists;r
 opposition from the right-center
 -aimed at the supranational as-
 pects of EURATOM; and with fears,
 :particularly among Mendes-
 France Radicals, that the six-
 nation organization would be-too

 dence, he felt obliged to threat-
 Mollet apparently con-
 cluded that the threat of res-
 ignation was insufficient to
 assure success, however, and
 made additional concessions to
 center and rightist nationalists.
 He promised to demand at the
 current Brussels conference
 that the EURATOM treaty provide
 for institutions completely
 separate from those of the Coal-
 Steel Community,  Mollet also
 discriminated against West
 Germany by promising to insist
 that France and all other members

 except West Germany, regain tr^
 (right to manufacture nuclear weap-

 ~.~RICTION IN
 'aVEST GERMAN-YUGOSLAV .RELATIONS
 West German-Yugoslav re-
 lations suffered a setback on
 7 July when the Bundestag, irked
 at recent Yugoslav statements
 seeming to imply recognition
 of East Germany, adjourned with-
 out ratifying-the West German
 commercial loan to Yugoslavia
 or the war claims agreement
 negotiated in March.  Yugosla-
 via's indignant reaction will
 probably jeopardize West Ger-
 many's economic position there.
 These incidents typify the dif-
 ficulties Bonn is likely to en-
 counter in its relations with
 .other states on matters per-
 taining to East Germany,
 West German officials had
 demonstrated a desire early
 this year for improved relations
 with Yugoslavia, and negotia-
 tions for a $14,000,000 settle-
 ment of Yugoslav war claims were
 completed on 10 March.  Payment
 of a $50,000,000 postwar Yugca-
 Slav trade indebtedness to West
 Overmany was postponed to 1968,
 and West Germany granted a $5?,-
 000,000 long-term ,commercial
 loan to Yugoslavia at-the same
 time,  These commercial agree-
 ments indicated West Germany's
 interest in long-term consolida-
 tion of its position in-the
 Yugoslav market.
 The trend toward better re-
 cations received a sharp set-
 back, however, as a result of
 Pdarshal Tito's trip to Moscow.
 ~gest German leaders objected to
 the joint Tito-Khrushchev com~
 rnuniquL issued on 24 June which
 stated that there are two sov-
 ereign German states and that
 German reunification should pro-
 teed from East-West German nego-
 tiations.  This eommuniqu~ and
 other Yugoslav statements an
 the de facto existence of two
 German states led many Bonn
 leaders to fear. that Tito might

 irked when they learned that
 Bonn intended to make ratifi-

 conditional on explicit assur-
 ances that Belgrade would not
 recognize East Germany.  State-
 ments by responsible Yugoslav
 leaders, however, that they
 had only recognized the d,~ facto
 existence of, two German govern-
 ments, with no present intention
 of establishing diplomatic re-
 lations with East Germany, left
 the Bundestag still so suspicious
 that it refused to ratify the
 'two March agreements before ad-
 journing on 7 July.
 The Belgrade press has
 been extremely indignant, accus-
 ing Bonn of having attempted to
 exploit the economic negotiations
 to influence Yugoslav policy to-
 ward East Germany.
 It is still unclear as to
 what steps Bonn might take in
 the event of Yugoslav recogni-
 tion of East Germany.  The con-
 troversy possibly typifies the
 difficulties Bonn will encounter
 by its policy of threatening
 retaliation against countries
 recognizing East Germany.
 Dras-tic off icial Yugoslav
 counteraction is unlikely be-
 fore a clear-cut decision is
 made in Bonn, but the Federal
 E,epublic has probably seriously
 jeopardized its economic privi-
 leges affirmed in the commercial
 agreements, including a provision
 .giving the West Germans equal nav-
 igation  rights on the Danube
 with Yugoslavia.

 RECENT SOVIET AGRICULTURAL
 DECREJE
 The Soviet Union has taken
 the unusual step of publishing
 a decree in draft form and al-
 lowing "public discussion" be-
 fore governmental approval.
 The proposed decree, issued on
 25 June, is designed to elimi-
 nate the uSe of grain products
 and other foodstuffs purchased
 from state stores as feed for
 privately owned livestock.  The
 proposed decree would also re-
 strict the private ownership
 of livestock in urban areas
 through the introduction of
 high monetary taxes and oblig-
 atory deliveries of milk and
 meat,
 The removal in 1953 of the
 :restructions on urban ownership
 .and production of livestock pro-
 duce has, according to the de-
 cree, resulted in a situation
 which many urban dwellers have
 t~xploited t4for  private  gain."
 ;Livestock products command high
 orices on the open markets and
 ;ire in short supply in state
 stores, while grain products
 ;have been cheap and relatively
 ;plentiful.  The decree states
 that townspeople and collective
 :farmers adjacent to towns took
 advantage of the removal of
 :restrictions by feeding bread
 and other foodstuffs purchased
 :from state stores to livestock.
 'T'his  practice '?disorganizes"

 of total numbers, but probably
 account for a disproportionate-
 ly large share of the live-
 stock products available in
 urban areas.  Furthermore, the
 draft decree indicates that
 since 1953 large increases
 have occurred in the production
 of livestock products in the
 .urban areas--where Soviet of-
 ficials probably least ex-
 pected. them.  The new measures
 probably would reduce the urban
 supply of livestock products.
 The decree promises that
 the decline in the supply of
 -urban livestock products which
 would result from its enactment
 will be quickly overcome by
 increased .state and collective
 livestock production<  This
 increase in socialized produc-
 tion, in turn, is to result
 partly from new measures aimed
 at persuading urban livestock
 holders to sell their livestock
 to the state.

 portedly aroused much opposi-
 tion in Soviet urban areas,
 About a week after its publica-
 t-ion., the Soviet minister of
 state farms,Benediktov, said
 it would undergo major changes
 before promulgation.  The Soviet
 leadership,by .issuing the de-
 cree in draft for discussion.,
 is apparently trying to con-

 PAST III
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 DEVELOPMENT OF THE
 The Sino-Soviet alliance,
 which was firm in Stalin's
 time, seems to be as firm or
 firmer under the Khrushchev-
 Bulganin leadership.  In the
 past-two years, the Kremlin
 has helped Peiping to increase
 its international prestige,
 has continued its- aid to the
 Chinese Communist military
 establishment, and has agreed
 to enlarge substantially
 its contribution to China's
 ixidustrialization.  Peiping
 may have adjusted its policy
 toward Taiwan to fit the
 Soviet aims of avoiding a
 general war and of engaging
 the West in a long-term compe--
 tition.  The Chinese are also
 closely co-ordinating with
 Moscow their programs else-
 where in the Far and Near East.
 The Stalin Era
 Soviet dictation of Chi-
 nese Communist tactics in the
 1920's was followed by a series
 of failures.  With Mao''Tse-
 tung's triumph over Soviet-
 trained internal opposition in
 1935, and with Moscow's belated
 .endorsement of Mao's program
 the same year, Chinese Com-
 munist primacy in devising the
 party's program for China was
 established.  Although the
 Chinese Communists were quick
 to adjust to changes in Soviet
 foreign policy after 1935, the
 Kremlin apparently did not
 again interfere in Peiping's
 domestic planning or in the
 Chinese Communist Party organi-
 zat-ion.  From that time until
 now, the principal criterion
 for advancement in the Chinese
 party has seemed to be loyalty
 to Mao Tse-tung rather than to
 any group of leaders in Moscow,
 It is not known whether
 Stalin at any time considered
 attempting to transform Soviet
 influence ,over thy: Chinese
 SING-SOVIET ALLIANCE
 Communists into Soviet control
 of the movement.  Any inten-
 tion along these lines would
 presumably have been discouraged
 by the experience in 1948 with
 Yugoslavia..  In any case, after
 the establishment of the Peiping
 regime in October 1949, the
 USSR treated Communist China
 with much greater deference
 than it did the Eastern Euro-
 pean Satellites and apparently
 made no effo"rt to reduce Pei-
 ping to satellite status.
 SinodSoviet
 Treaty
 The Sino-Soviet treaty of
 February .1950, concluded during
 Mao's only known trip outside
 China, became the rough guide
 for Soviet treatment of the
 Peiping regime during the next
 few years.  It provided for
 consultation on all matters of
 common concern, and subsequent
 Soviet and Chinesge policies
 for the most part have seemed
 well co-ordinated.  It gave
 Peiping a Soviet military
 commitment in the event of
 attack by Japan or any ally of
 Japan,  a conunitment which,
 while evasive, has been publicly
 extolled by  Peiping as a
 deterrent to ~.merican action
 against the China mainland.
 The treaty also promised
 Feiping $300,000,00? in economic
 aid and provided for Soviet
 occupation of Port Arthur,
 joint control of the main rail-
 way in Manchuria, and joint
 operation of certain other
 enterprises in Manchuria and
 Sinkiang.
 The Chinese Communist
 victory over the Nationalists
 during 1949 may have led Stalin
 to believe that the Western
 powers could be forced from the
 Asian mainland without great
 risk to the ~TSSR, and,. in the
 case of Korea, without great

 successful UN intervention in

 Korea.
 in the Sino-Soviet relationship
 --although a strain far short
 of rupture.  A Chinese Com-
 munist delegation initially
 headed by Chou was engaged in
 high-level ecanomic negotia-
 tions in Moscow from August
 1952 to May 1953,  The prolonged
 talks suggest that there was
 hard bargaining and possible
 Chinese disappo~,ntment over
 failure to obtain greatly in-
 creased Soviet support of
 Peiping's industrialization
 program.
 Korean Settlement
 There may also have been
 a difference of views between
 Peiping and Moscow on the terms
 for a Korean cease-fire, nego-
 tiations for which were begun
 as a result of Soviet initia-
 tive in 1951.  The USSR, having
 restored Communist control of
 North Korea by proxy, seemed
 to fear that any concession to
 the West would be regarded .as
 a sign of weakness and the
 negotiations dragged on until
 after Stalin's death.  The
 Chinese Communists, on the other
 hand, boasted that they had
 achieved a stand-off with the
 West and suggested they would
 like to get on with China's
 industrialization.
 The Indian formula for a
 Korean truce in late 1952 was
 denounced by Soviet UN delegate
 Vyshinsky after the Indians--
 perhaps incorrectly--had con-
 cluded that their proposal was
 satisfactory to Chou En-lai.
 In any case, Chou made his own
 bid for the Korean settlement
 .shortly after Stalin's death,
 and Soviet diplomats then
 endorsed Chou's overtures.
 There may have been
 another strain at this time
 Moreover, Mao in early
 1953, following Stalin's
 death, published an article
 called "The Greatest Friendship"
 in which he suggested a real
 sense of loss over the "great
 teacher" and "most sincere
 friend" of the Chinese people.
 Recent Soviet Policy
 In May 1953, the new
 Soviet leadership apparently
 moved a considerable way toward
 meeting Ghinese economic demands
 by agreeing to provide aid for
 the construction of 141 basic
 enterprises in China under a
 program running through~1959.
 In October 1954 the Kremlin
 agreed to extend aid to 15
 additional basic construction
 projects and to provide another
 long-term credit of $130,000,-
 000,  In April this year, First
 Deputy Premier Mikoyan committed
 the USSR to assist Peiping in
 building 55 more industrial
 enterprises.  There seems little
 doubt that Soviet econom~,c aid
 of this type is being given the
 Chinese as rapidly as they can
 handle it.
 Military Aid:  The Kremlin.
 is continuing its substantial
 military aid to Communist China,
 while helping the Chinese
 develop their own production
 capabilities.

 12 July  195F.
 The Russians Have also
 given extensive technical
 assistance to Peiping's air-
 craft and shipbuilding Indus-.
 tries.  Under the supervision
 of many Soviet advisers, naval
 shipyards in Shanghai have-,been
 greatly expanded in the past
 year.,  In launching their first
 modern .destroyer iri April 1956,
 the Chinese apparently matched ,
 timetables of Soviet yards for
 production of this vessel,.  The
 Chinese have also succeeded,
 with much: Soviet help, in a
 "trial"  production o:?  jet air-
 -craft engines.-
 Training:  In addition to
 providing large numbers of
 Soviet advisers on reasonable
 terms, the Soviet Union is
 educating some thousands of
 Chinese students. -There are
 now about 2,600 Chinese students
 in the USSR, with nearly 7,000
 more scheduled to go to the
 USSR--and 700 to the Satellites
 --through 1957.  In addition,
 about 11,500 young Chinese are
 to be sent to the USSR and the
 Satellites in the next few years
 for "practical training."
 Political  Su~~or____t_~ :   The
 present-Soviet lead .have
 been making. an effort to go
 even further than Stalin in
 helping Peiping acquire inter
 national prestige.  When a high-
 -level Soviet delegation--in-
 eluding Khrushchev, Bulganin,
 Mikoyan and Shepilov--visited
 Peiping in the fall of 1954,
 142oscorv agreed to an early trans-
 fer to the Chinese of Soviet
 shares in the four Sino-Soviet
 joint stock. companies and.
 to the early withdrawal of
 Soviet armed forces from Port
 Arthur.  In thus liquidating
 Soviet footholds in China--
 which had often been interpret-
 ed  by Asians as evidence of
 European  extraterritoriality--
 the Soviet leaders fulfilled
 a commitment given in 1950, for
 which they took credit.
 Public. Soviet support for
 Peiping's policies reached a
 new high during the Soviet visit
 in the fall of'1954.  Khrushchev
 declared that the Soviet people
 sympathized with and supported
 the'Chinese in their determine-
 tion,to "liberate" Taiwan.
 Although Ifhrushehev did not
 ,ment~ion~the type of Soviet sup-
 port which Peiping, could expect,
 his speech was the first in
 which~..any tap-level Soviet
 leader. had publicly pledged
 support for this Chinese Com-
 munist-goal.
 Coleadership
 Immediately after taking
 .over in February-1955, the
 Khrushchev-Bulganin team ele-
 vated Peiping to the status of
 "coleader'`' ? of  the world Com-
 munist camp.  Soviet propagan-
 dists began to refer to Com-
 munist China as a power capable
 of;"taking care of itself."
 Whi~.e the use of such descrip-
 tions of the Peiping regime
 made ft possible for the USSR
 to-claim that it was not re-
 sponsible for Peiping's actions,
 this characterization, in terms
 of prestige, went far beyond
 angthing ever previously ac-
 corded a non-Russian Communist
 movement.
 Soviet leaders subsequently
 wade no effort to force the
 Chinese Communists to conform
 to the Soviet line on "collec-
 tive leadership,"  Chinese Com-
 munist praise of Mao's personal
 leadership continued, and in
 July 1955 ~llao emphatically as-
 serted that leadership by
 purilicl.y reversing the policies
 of all other~Chinese Communist
 leaders who' h~,d spoken on the
 subject of the speed of China's
 socialization.

 some doctrinal points which had
 been simmering for years. between
 Russian and Chinese theorists. ,
 The new Soviet approach was
 shown by several speakers at
 the Soviet 20th Party Congress,
 who affirmed that there may be
 "different roads. to socialism."
 Shepil?v, for example, remarked
 That the Chinese program, "from
 the point of view of a (mere)
 Bookman of Marxism, is almost
 tantamount to trampling under

 during the devaluation of Stalin
 during 1956.  In what Chou En-
 lai has described as a "very
 serious and responsible" edito-
 rial of early April--written by
 proteges of Mao--Peiping. took a
 more moderate line than did the
 Soviet press.  The editorial
 minimized Stalin's errors on
 China in the 1920's by attribut-
 ing  them to former Chinese Com-
 munist leaders, and did not ac-
 cuse Stalin of sins against'-
 China in even the latter part of
 his life, when he made "gross
 errors'' in other. directions.
 The Soviet press has not express-
 ed or implied any criticism of
 Peiping's treatment of Stalin.
 Policy on Taiwan
 Peiping's propaganda about
 Taiwan. reached an all-time high
 in belligerency in early 1955,
 and there seemed at least.a mar-
 gi~al possibility of an early
 attack in the Taiwan area.  Then

 CURRENT INTELLIOENGE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 12 July 1956
 LATIN AMERICAN ATTITUAES TOWARD U5 INVESTMENT
 Latin American dissatis-
 faction with Washington's empha-
 sis on private rather than
 government investment in Latin
 America has notably abated
 during the past several months.
 While this dissatisfaction had
 become less intense following.
 the Rio conference of November
 1954, it could well resume its
 former intensity if measures
 taken by the United States and
 local economic reforms do not
 substantially increase-.the flow
 of private dollar capital.
 Latin American Hopes
 At the end of World War II,
 the Latin Americans had expected
 a large influx of private Amer-
 ican capital for the accelerated
 industrialization of the south-
 ern continent.  However,. recol-
 lection of heavy losses on past.
 private investment in Latin
 American government-bands had
 a discouraging effect, and more
 secure opportunities in. the
 United States-and Canada proved
 too strong a counter-attraction
 to private investors,  Conse-
 quently, the Latin Americans
 increasingly disparaged private
 capital as a source of funds,
 Nevertheless, American private
 investment in these countries
 amounts to about $6.5 billion,
 or 3? percent of total US for-
 eign investment.
 Being accustomed to a
 larger role for government in
 economic affairs than prevails
 in the United States, they re-
 sented Washington's view that
 they should themselves create
 internal conditions attractive
 to private investment and should
 use foreign public loans pri-
 marily as a further stimulant,
 not as a substitute.
 US private investment in
 Latin America declined from
 $580,000,000 in 1952.to
 $223,000,.000 in 1954, and con-
 siderable resentment over: US

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY  SUMMARY
 12 July 1956
 Peru's success over the
 past six years in similarly at-
 tracting private capital on the
 basis of economic reforms rec-
 ommended by the same US experts
 has had an important psycho-
 logical impact beyond Peruvian
 borders.
 Political and Economic Problems
 It is by no means certain,
 however, that this improved
 Latin American attitude toward
 private investment .will endure.
 There is no evidence of any im-
 pressive over-all increase. in
 the flow of private dollar cap-
 ital to Latin America,  The
 IFC's operations are not`sched-
 uled to begin for another few
 weeks and other measures -for
 expanding private investment
 have apparently not yet had
 time to take effect.
 The Brazilian and Argentine
 governments face grave political
 problems that will. restrict
 their ability to carry out the
 disinflationary and other eco-
 nomic reform measures needed to
 create a climate favorable to
 large-scale foreign investment.
 The level. of savings and domestic
 investment in many other Latin
 American countries also con-
 tinues to be depressed by pres-
 sures for a rising standard of
 living combined-with such basic
 unsolved problems as vulnera-
 bility to fluctuations in world
 prices of a limited range of
 exports.
 If the ambitious stabiliza-
 tion plans of mayor Latin Ameri-
 can countries should fall con-
 spicuously short of realization
 during the remainder of this
 year, or should there be a broad
 economic downturn, a resurgence
 of bitter criticism of the
 United States' "neglect of
 Latin American .financial and
 development needs" can be ex-
 pected. .This would be particu-
 larly conspicuous at the next
 inter-American economic con-
 ference tentatively scheduled
 in the spring of 1957.
 Under  such  ~Qriditions,
 moreover, Latin ~~uerican coun-
 tries might well become vul-
 nerable to Soviet bloc offers
 of development capital at lower
 interest rates than those
 available in the West
