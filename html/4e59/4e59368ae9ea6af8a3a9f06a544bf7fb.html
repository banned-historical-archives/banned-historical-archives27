 China: In Pursuit of
 Economic Modernization

 Summary
 Chinese economic policies have undergone great change in the two years
 since Mao's death and the purge of the leftist Gang of Four. In contrast to the
 narrowly conceived policies of earlier years-products of a rigid and confin-
 ing ideological orthodoxy-both domestic and foreign economic policies now
 display a vigorous, growth-oriented pragmatism. The most dramatic policy
 reversal has been Peking's invitation of US oil firms to participate in the
 development of China's offshore oil. Prior to October 1976, such a move
 would have been inconceivable.
 Ideological constraints, though greatly relaxed, are still present; but they
 are much less confining and therefore have less impact on policy decisions
 than the desire for rapid economic growth and considerations of economic
 efficiency. The effect has been to greatly expand the number of policy options
 available to Peking, and the moderate government has exhibited remarkable
 flexibility in its initial round of decisions.
 Peking's overriding goal is to build China into a major economic power
 by the end of the century. In the view of China's leaders, this requires the
 rapid modernization of agriculture, industry, and science and technology.
 When national defense needs are added, the programs that Peking has in
 mind are referred to as the "four modernizations."
 The Fifth Five-Year Plan (1976-80) was to have been the launching pad
 for this modernization drive. After a poor start, however, attributable in part
 to a resurgence of leftist power and political turmoil, the Fifth Plan has been
 incorporated into a 10-year plan that extends through 1985. The few targets
 publicized thus far indicate that the new plan is ambitious and in many
 respects probably feasible only under the most auspicious conditions. How-
 ever, regardless of whether all targets are met on schedule, the new plan
 signifies a long overdue commitment to major modernization and expansion
 programs for key sectors of the economy.

 The success of the 10-year plan, and the modernization program as a
 whole, hinges on Peking's ability to strengthen management, raise labor
 productivity, and improve the effectiveness of investment. Already, reforms
 are under way, and changes are evident in industrial organization, factory
 management, wage policy, and in policy toward science and education. The
 relaxation of the political climate has also paved the way for freer discussion
 of economic problems and the rehabilitation of prominent economists who
 were purged during the Cultural Revolution.
 Permeating these reforms and reflecting the vigor of the new pragma-
 tism is a willingness to draw on foreign technology and capital that goes well
 beyond past limits. Also evident is a recognition that imports of plants and
 equipment alone cannot solve China's problems. Foreign systems of manage-
 ment, methods of education, and the like are also of considerable interest.
 As the plan proceeds, the anti-Gang of Four, "let's get on with it"
 sentiments that have helped produce a broad consensus on goals and
 programs will weaken as a source of cohesion. And the plan will need to be
 readjusted, reopening potentially contentious issues. With its options greatly
 expanded, however, Peking should find itself in a better position to deal with
 the economic trade-offs that have in the past given focus to disruptive
 political disputes.
 While policy options are no longer circumscribed by a rigid ideological
 orthodoxy, economic realities still pose formidable obstacles to modernization.
 China's nearly 1 billion people, an agricultural sector technologically so
 backward that it employs 70 percent of the labor force, a "modern" industry
 using techniques that are 10 to 30 years out of date and with operations
 presently most inefficient-these are the basic determinants of China's
 economic future, and they will impose strict limits on the pace of moderniza-
 tion. These economic facts of life emphasize the difficulties facing China's
 leadership; they do not, however, deny the possibilities for substantial
 improvement in economic performance. Other factors, such as native abilities
 and political and cultural strengths, ameliorate to some extent the limits set
 by basic economic conditions. The apparent determination of the current
 leadership to rapidly modernize the economy suggests that, perhaps for the
 first time in the 30-year history of the People's Republic of China, the full
 economic potential of the Chinese economy may be exploited.
 The discussion which follows is not a rigorous examination, either of
 China's new 10-year plan or of the other topics discussed. For the most part,
 the absence or near absence of statistical data preclude all but the simplest
 quantitative treatment. Rather, it is meant to be a collection of considered
 impressions of the plan and of the policy changes which have become
 apparent in 1977-78.

 China: In Pursuit of
 Economic
 BACKGROUND
 Many of China's economic problems in recent
 years are traceable to the Cultural Revolution
 (1966-69). As a result of that episode, a faction
 deriving its power basically from its access to
 Mao Tse-tung and its control of the propaganda
 apparatus became a major political force in the
 1970s and a source of economic instability. Eco-
 nomic issues increasingly were defined in ideo-
 logical terms, with struggles between moderates
 and leftists sharply reducing Peking's ability to
 deal with economic problems. The confusion
 among managers, workers, and rank-and-file
 party cadres, caused by abrupt and extreme
 swings in policy, further contributed to deteriora-
 tion of the economy.
 By the mid-1970s the seriousness of the eco-
 nomic situation had become apparent, even to
 outside observers. Deterioration has been most
 evident in industry-where growing production
 imbalances within the iron and steel industry
 have resulted in steel shortages, and where de-
 clining growth in coal production has caused
 widely disruptive energy shortages. Agriculture
 has also been affected. The media in recent
 months have revealed numerous occasions when
 local cadres, in carrying out leftist policies, took
 actions which reduced the work incentives of
 commune members.' Such instances, repeated
 throughout the countryside and coupled with
 disruptions to the flows of industrial inputs and
 consumer goods to rural areas, may help explain
 why agricultural performance has been particu-
 larly disappointing since 1975.
 When a strengthened moderate faction began
 in 1975 to advocate strong measures to revitalize
 the economy, the list of economic problems fac-
 Modernization
 ' Perhaps the most common complaint has concerned the en-
 forcement of overly restrictive regulations on private and collective
 trade on rural free markets. In some areas, this led to a significant
 reduction in peasant income.
 ing Peking greatly obscured the gains that had
 been made over the previous two decades.
 China's GNP by 1975 was some 2.7 times that of
 1957, the final year of the First Five-Year Plan.
 With population growing at an average annual
 rate of over 2 percent, this works out to per
 capita GNP growth of just over 3 percent yearly.
 An overwhelming share of this growth has come
 from industry, where output has expanded at an
 average annual rate of about 9 percent. In
 contrast, as one would expect of a sector employ-
 ing traditional, centuries-old production technol-
 ogies on relatively fixed land area, agriculture
 has grown much more slowly-2 percent annu-
 ally, or approximately the same rate as popula-
 tion growth.
 This record of impressive, but uneven, growth
 has been obtained by maintaining investment at
 a high 20 to 25 percent of GNP. Conversely, the
 share of output going to consumption has been
 restricted, and gains in personal consumption
 have been modest. There have been noteworthy
 improvements for the consumer in some areas,
 particularly in health and education. In such
 basic and important items as food and clothing,
 however, gains since 1957 have been much less
 noticeable.  When compared with pre-1949
 days-a comparison that Peking likes to make-
 even the minimal gains in food and clothing
 consumption acquire added significance. But as
 time goes by, fewer and fewer individuals are
 able to remember those days; and over the past
 decade, the comparison has begun to lose its
 impact on the Chinese consumer.
 On the eve of the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1976-
 80), Peking therefore had to face up to several
 critical problems:
 ? Agriculture, despite heavy dosages of invest-
 ment since the mid-1960s, remained a drag
 on the economy.

 Approved For Release 2004/02/23 : CIA-RDP80T00702A000500060015-4
 ? Industry, the major source of growth for
 more than a quarter of a century, was beset
 with growing difficulties.
 ? The urban labor force, after two decades of
 sacrifice, had begun to demand a higher
 priority for consumption at a time when
 investment needs also were greater.
 These general issues, along with the inade-
 quacy of the transportation network, greatly
 increased the pressures on China's leadership.
 ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IN 1976-78
 The first two years of the Fifth Plan were
 disappointing. Economic performance in 1976
 was extraordinarily poor: turmoil associated with
 the purge of the Gang of Four, unfavorable
 weather, and the devastating T'angshan earth-
 quake combined to hold the level of economic
 activity to a standstill. Last year saw notable
 progress in some sectors and continued stagna-
 tion in others; for the economy as a whole,
 performance fell short of expectations. The all-
 important grain harvest in 1977 remained un-
 changed from the 1975 level of about 285 million
 tons. Industrial output in 1976 showed no gain
 over 1975, although productive capacity contin-
 ued to expand. And despite the 14-percent gain
 claimed for 1977, many industrial facilities were
 still operating well below capacity in the first
 half of 1978.
 After industrial production failed to grow in
 1976, Peking had hoped that a strong recovery in
 1977-the first full year following the purge of
 the Gang-would provide a firm basis for accel-
 erated growth during the remainder of the Fifth
 Plan. However, shortages of raw materials and
 electric power left many plants with considerable
 idle capacity. These problems were made worse
 by continued worker unrest, commercial disloca-
 tions, and widespread violations of financial reg-
 ulations. Late that year, State Planning Commis-
 sion chief Yu Ch'iu-li told a forum of party and
 state cadres that because of severe bottlenecks
 and the generally chaotic situation, China's eco-
 nomic problems could not be solved in a single
 year.
 Many of these problems will occupy Peking for
 the remainder of this plan period, but there is
 little question that economic recovery is well
 under way. Statistics for the first half of 1978
 would seem to warrant a more bullish assess-
 ment, but their meaning is obscured by the
 comparison with the first half of 1977, when the
 economy was floundering. For example, gross
 value of industrial output for the first half of
 1978 was reported as 24.6 percent above that for
 the comparable period of 1977; and substantial
 gains were claimed for steel production (66.9
 percent), coal (19.3 percent), electricity (17 per-
 cent), crude oil (11.2 percent), cement (32.8
 percent), chemical fertilizers (47 percent), and
 tractors (27 percent). The volume of rail freight
 reportedly rose by 22.4 percent. Despite these
 gains-so large that they appear to say more
 about the weakness of the economy in early 1977
 than the strength of activity in 1978-Hua Kuo-
 feng in July described progress at that point only
 as "in the nature of recovery." Other information
 also suggests that the level of economic activity
 in 1978 has been merely satisfactory and that the
 economy remains vulnerable in many areas.
 Apart from the continuing disorder, planners
 have repeatedly cited agriculture, steel, electric
 power, coal, and transportation as "weak links."
 The list should also include light industry where
 production problems have been described as
 "acute."
 THE EMERGING SHAPE OF
 NEW ECONOMIC POLICIES
 Modernization and the 10-Year Plan
 Peking has yet to specify what is meant by its
 announced goal of achieving "front rank" eco-
 nomic power by the year 2000. This obviously
 requires a major breakthrough in the lagging
 agricultural sector, greatly expanded industrial
 capacity, and the development of a strong capa-
 bility in science and technology, especially of an
 applied nature. Progress along these lines should
 lead to substantially improved living standards
 and real incomes. But this could hardly create, in
 a single generation, anything resembling an af-
 fluent society. For example, were China able to

 Approved For Release 2004/02/23 : CIA-RDP80T00702A000500060015-4
 sustain its historical growth rate of about 6
 percent annually, by the year 2000 its GNP
 would still be 15 percent below what US GNP
 was in 1975. And with a population that is likely
 to approach 1.5 billion by the end of the century,
 China's per capita GNP would be less than
 $1,000, about equal to that of Brazil at present.
 Even remarkable Chinese success in implement-
 ing birth control programs would not alter this
 judgment. Actual possibilities for the economy
 over the next two decades, of course, fan out
 considerably depending on how much progress is
 made during the next eight years, the first phase
 of the modernization program.
 Agricultural Goals
 Peking's target of producing 400 million tons
 of grain in 1985 implies average annual growth
 of 4.3 percent in 1978-85, compared with a 3.6-
 percent average during the previous eight years
 and no increase at all in 1976 and 1977. Attain-
 ment of this goal would mean grain production of
 more than 350 kilograms per capita, well above
 the 300-kilogram level achieved in the late 1950s
 and regained in recent years. China's planners
 clearly are banking on early payoffs from ex-
 panded mechanization and land improvement
 programs, as well as improved seeds and rapidly
 increasing output from imported chemical fertil-
 izer plants now coming on stream.
 Since other agricultural subsectors, such as
 livestock and subsidiary production, have consis-
 tently grown more rapidly than grain output, the
 goal of 4- to 5-percent annual growth in the total
 value of agricultural production should not be too
 difficult to achieve if the grain production target
 is attained. Realistically, output is likely to fall
 somewhat short of these goals.
 Industrial Targets
 The planned annual increase of more than 10
 percent in total industrial output seems within
 reach, given the 9-percent average annual
 growth of the past decade-which occurred in
 spite of periodic, politically caused disruptions.
 Still, the Chinese will have to make an enormous
 effort in energy-especially oil and coal-and
 steel, and increase their purchases of foreign-
 made plants and equipment. The planned change
 in the pattern of growth, favoring light industry,
 may also cause unforeseen difficulties.
 Investment Priorities
 Agriculture
 Peking's 10-year plan places heavy demands
 on agriculture for foodstuffs and industrial raw
 materials, both for domestic consumption and
 export. The stagnation of grain production since
 1975-following a. decade and a half of heavy
 investment in agriculture-has once again dem-
 onstrated the vulnerability of the economy to
 agricultural setbacks. Earlier this year, party
 Chairman Hua Ku.o-feng spelled out the implica-
 tions of continued slow growth in agriculture:
 ... Agriculture is the foundation of the
 national economy. If agriculture does not
 develop faster, there will be no upswing in
 our industry and economy as a whole; and
 even if there is a temporary upswing, a
 decline will follow. There will be really
 serious trouble in the event of major natural
 calamities....
 To accelerate output growth-or, perhaps more
 realistically, to guard against the possibility that
 a series of poor harvests will undercut the 10-
 year plan and stall the drive for modernization-
 Peking  has stepped up its investment in
 agriculture.
 Current agricultural policy emphasizes in-
 creased mechanization along with a push for
 farmland improvement. As a result of steel short-
 ages in 1976-77, the mechanization program is
 behind schedule, but the leadership intends to
 make up for lost time and fulfill the original
 targets. These targets call for the "basic" mecha-
 nization of agriculture by 1980.2 Goals for major
 items, apparently stated in terms of inventory
 (except for fertilizer), include:
 ? A 70-percent increase in large and medium-
 sized tractors.
 2 Precisely what is meant by "basic" mechanization is unclear.
 One official has defined it as replacing with machines 70 percent of
 the manpower employed in major farm operations.

 ? A 110-percent increase in machine-drawn
 farm implements.
 ?-A 36-percent increase in hand-guided trac-
 tors.
 ? A 32-percent increase in drainage and irriga-
 tion machinery.
 ? A 58-percent increase in chemical fertilizer
 production.'
 To achieve these goals, state-supplied steel for
 the manufacture and repair of farm machines
 during 1978-80 will be raised by a total of 50
 percent over the previous three-year period; and
 the share of locally produced steel used on the
 farm and in machinery production will be upped
 from the current 30 percent or so to more than
 40 percent.
 Perhaps because these objectives are so ambi-
 tious, and the sector so backward, Peking has
 selected the farm machinery industry as one of
 the first industries to be reorganized under a plan
 that may eventually encompass all of industry.
 Underlying this action is the familiar proposition
 that production, quality of output, and productiv-
 ity can be substantially improved by setting up
 large, highly specialized production facilities.'
 Although small, locally managed plants will con-
 tinue to be important sources of simple machin-
 ery and equipment for the farm sector, they will
 no longer be the primary agent for mechaniza-
 tion. Many of these plants instead will be ab-
 sorbed into local or regional networks featuring
 large-scale, specialized production and assembly
 facilities. One of the reports delivered at the
 Third National Conference on Agricultural
 ' Asked to outline mechanization goals, an official in the State
 Council office in charge indicated that one of the goals is to supply
 600 kilograms of chemical fertilizer per hectare by 1980.
 'New China News Agency recently reported that the First
 Ministry of Machine Building held a meeting at which delegates
 "summed up both positive and negative experiences gained since
 1964 in organizing production according to the principle of coordi-
 nation between specialized departments.... They unanimously
 agreed that a salient problem in the organization and management
 of the machine building industry today is that factories are either
 `big and all-inclusive' or `small and all-inclusive,' and because of
 that, duplication in construction and production is quite common,
 production is scattered and small scale, and production processes
 are backward with low efficiency, poor quality, and high costs."
 The farm machinery and motor vehicle industries have been chosen
 as the first sectors to be reorganized.
 Mechanization, held in January, told how au-
 thorities in one municipality had doubled the
 output of tractor gears in only six months by
 pooling the gearmaking equipment from seven
 different tractor plants and adopting more up-to-
 date production techniques.
 Increased mechanization is designed first of all
 to relieve seasonal labor shortages, the most
 immediate and direct effect of which will be to
 permit an increase in multiple cropping and raise
 grain yields. Larger supplies of irrigation and
 drainage equipment will improve Chinese capac-
 ity to deal with drought andflooding and will aid
 in the expansion of areas of "high and stable
 yields."
 Mechanization will also help compensate for
 the loss of agricultural labor to nonfarm activi-
 ties-a problem that appears to have been sig-
 nificant during recent years. Since the early
 1970s, as a result of the rapid development of
 rural industry, demand for rural labor has
 greatly increased. Large numbers of peasants
 have been drawn away from collective agricul-
 tural activities, resulting in a shortage of farm
 labor and, in some areas, a decline in farm
 output. Increased mechanization will help solve
 these problems and will also encourage more
 rapid industrialization in those areas where in-
 dustrial development has been retarded by labor
 shortages.
 The growth in use of machines envisaged by
 Peking will encounter difficulties, many of which
 relate to or affect the demand for farm machin-
 ery. Poor machine quality, the lack of standard-
 ization, and the limited range of equipment and
 accessories available have been cited as major
 reasons for the reorganization of the farm ma-
 chinery industry. Without substantial improve-
 ments in these areas, rural communes and pro-
 duction brigades may be reluctant to make major
 investment purchases. An additional factor in
 this investment decision is the scarcity of trained
 manpower to operate and repair farm machinery.
 Peking anticipates considerable improvement in
 these areas (the number of technicians is to be
 doubled by 1980); and to further attract pur-
 chasers, ? it plans to cut costs-and presumably
 prices-20 percent by 1980.

 The goal of 85-percent mechanization set for
 1985 means that investment in machinery will
 continue to absorb a large share of agricultural
 investment during the Sixth Five-Year Plan
 (1981-85), but there will be a shift of emphasis
 away from simple machinery and tractors to
 heavier, more sophisticated items. Farmland
 capital construction, particularly those programs
 other than irrigation and drainage, will receive
 relatively greater emphasis during  1981-85
 (compared with 1976-80) in order to meet the
 1985 target of providing one mou (one-fifteenth
 of a hectare) of stable, high-yield farmland per
 rural resident. Peking also plans during the next
 plan period to invest more heavily in land recla-
 mation, much of it in border areas where state
 farms are predominant; more than 13 million
 hectares of land are to be reclaimed during the
 next eight years, expanding farmland by some 12
 percent. The chemical fertilizer industry should
 continue to receive a large share of investment
 during the Sixth Plan period; although the last of
 the 13 large imported urea complexes will be in
 full production by that time, the rate of applica-
 tion of chemical fertilizers still will be low com-
 pared with usage in Japan and Taiwan.
 The above discussion highlights the more im-
 portant components of agricultural investment
 scheduled for 1976-85. Peking is aware of the
 complexities of rural development and that the
 above programs are only part of the matrix of
 inputs and practices that are associated with the
 modernization of agriculture. Current programs
 do not ignore, for example, the investments that
 must be made to improve seed varieties, to
 develop better methods of plant protection, and
 to adapt cultivation techniques to new crops and
 cropping patterns. For the moment, however, the
 emphasis is on machinery, land improvement,
 and chemical fertilizer production-which ap-
 parently are thought to offer quick payoffs in
 terms of sharp increases in labor productivity
 and output growth.
 Industry
 Hua Kuo-feng has sketched out the investment
 program that will be required to generate an
 overall industrial growth rate of more than 10
 percent annually during the next eight years.
 According to Hua:
 ... the state plans to build or complete
 120 large-scale projects, including 10 iron
 and steel complexes, nine nonferrous metal
 complexes, eight coal mines, 10 oil and gas
 fields, 30 power stations, six new trunk
 railways, and five key harbors.
 The cost of the program, in terms of funds
 budgeted for capital construction in industry
 during 1978-85, will approximately equal the
 total of the previous 28 years.'
 Metals. The 10 projects in the steel industry
 apparently include the construction of three en-
 tirely new complexes and the renovation and
 expansion of seven existing facilities. Peking is
 seeking the latest technology from Japan and
 possibly West Germany for these projects, and
 the cost will be enormous. The foreign exchange
 bill for one new plant alone could easily exceed
 the combined cost of all of China's whole plant
 purchases in the early 1970s. Because of the high
 cost and China's limited experience in construct-
 ing huge integrated plants, the steel moderniza-
 tion program almost certainly will be stretched
 out, perhaps even into the 1990s.
 Little is known about the nine nonferrous
 metal complexes cited by Hua, although Peking
 has approached both Japan and Italy regarding
 facilities for processing aluminum and copper.
 China's capabilities in these industries are badly
 dated, and Peking will probably seek out foreign
 suppliers of complete plants as the quickest
 means of expanding capacity and updating
 technology.
 Energy. Plans for 1985 indicate an attempt to
 rectify the longstanding imbalance in investment
 allocations that have grossly favored the oil
 industry and neglected coal. (Coal accounts for
 66 percent of primary energy production, petro-
 leum 23 percent, natural gas 10 percent, and
 hydroelectric power 1 percent.)
 During 1978-87, Peking plans to double coal
 production to reach an output rate of more than
 ' Hua has stated that the capital construction effort as a whole in
 1978-85, in terms of funds budgeted, will equal the total for the
 previous 28 years.

 I billion tons per year. This will prove difficult:
 the implicit average annual growth rate would be
 7.2 percent, compared with the actual 6.3-
 percent average growth in coal production since
 1970. The industry is technologically backward
 and its labor productivity notoriously low; over
 one-third of total output is produced at small
 mines and pits. To accomplish its goal, Peking
 plans to increase mechanization at existing mines
 and open eight new large mines.
 Oil production probably is planned to grow at
 rates comparable to those of recent years--
 around 13 percent annually-rather than at the
 rates of earlier years-over 20 percent. Nonethe-
 less, the share of investment allocated to the
 petroleum industry shows no signs of declin-
 ing. The costs of finding and producing oil are
 steadily rising. Most of China's readily accessible
 deposits-shallow deposits in the north and
 northeast-have already been tapped and in
 some cases are showing initial signs of depletion.
 For example, Ta-ch'ing, which produces one-half
 of China's oil, is yielding an increasingly large
 water cut (the field is water injected) and its
 shallow reservoirs have come within sight of
 depletion. The shallow deposits at Sheng-li and
 Ta-kang, which together produce another 30
 percent of total production, have some potential
 for expansion, but from their beginnings these
 fields-because of complex geological conditions
 that have resulted in a multiplicity of scattered,
 small reservoirs with widely differing character-
 istics-have taxed Chinese technical capabilities.
 Outside of a few fields with shallow deposits of
 unknown potential, additional production gains
 will have to come from deposits that are deeper,
 offshore, or located in the far west-and which
 therefore require large investments in infrastruc-
 ture and more advanced technology.
 Primarily as a result of coal shortages, domes-
 tic oil consumption has grown at an average
 annual rate of more than 15 percent since
 1970-a rate that Peking considers excessive,
 since it has eaten into the surplus available for
 export. Petroleum now supplies a little over 20
 percent of China's energy needs, up from 13
 percent in 1970. This shift toward greater use of
 oil is bound to continue, despite efforts to spur
 the growth of coal production.
 An examination of energy consumption trends
 indicates that it will be very difficult to slow the
 growth of demand for oil; indeed it will probably
 grow more rapidly as modernization gets under
 way. Mechanization will greatly add to petro-
 leum consumption in the agricultural sector,
 where energy use has nearly tripled since
 1970. And the expanded use of diesel locomotives
 and motor vehicles, together with agricultural
 mechanization, probably will more than offset
 any successful efforts by industry to reduce its
 per unit consumption of petroleum. With crude
 oil output rising at an average rate of 11 percent
 annually since 1974 and the future demand for
 oil-for domestic use and export-likely to ex-
 ceed 15 percent. annually, it is not hard to
 understand why Peking has moved so quickly to
 initiate talks with US and Japanese oil com-
 panies about possible cooperative development of
 China's offshore oil resources. As a result of
 domestic consumption trends and the importance
 of crude oil exports in foreign trade plans, the
 petroleum industry will continue to command a
 large share of state investment and in addition
 will receive a substantial infusion of foreign
 capital.
 The 30 new power plants, together with ca-
 pacity increases at small plants and the expan-
 sion of existing facilities, should enable the
 Chinese to maintain high rates of growth in
 electricity output through 1985. Nevertheless,
 capacity will expand at best by 6 to 8 million
 kilowatts per year (compared with an average of
 about 5 million kilowatts annually in recent
 years), and production will have difficulty keep-
 ing pace with demand. Local shortages will
 continue to occur. The severity of those shortages
 will depend upon the effectiveness of conserva-
 tion measures and the degree to which transmis-
 sion and distribution facilities are improved.
 Transportation
 The six new trunk railroads and five new
 harbors mentioned by Hua are only the more
 visible parts of a comprehensive program for
 modernizing the transport sector.
 Plans for the railroads, the backbone of
 China's transport sector, call for:

 Approved For Release 2004/02/23 : CIA-RDP80T00702A000500060015-4
 ? Widespread use of diesel and electric locomo-
 tives, lightweight passenger cars, greater ca-
 pacity freight cars, and the most modern
 high-speed passenger trains.
 ? Extensive adoption of heavy-duty rails, auto-
 matically controlled crossings, and increased
 capacity bridges.
 ? Introduction of computer services throughout
 the system.
 ? Mechanization of cargo handling, track
 maintenance, construction, and locomotive
 repair.
 To increase traffic on other transport modes-
 trucks, ships, and aircraft-China can be ex-
 pected to introduce such intermodal services as
 containerization and piggyback operations.
 In nearly all aspects, the Chinese must look
 abroad for both equipment and technological
 know-how. Although no major new contracts
 have been signed, substantial orders from Japan,
 West Germany, and France are in prospect. In
 addition to diesel locomotives, jet transports, and
 motor vehicles, the shopping list includes tech-
 nology related to centralized traffic control sys-
 tems and other computer applications.
 New Quest for Efficiency
 The above list of projects will greatly expand
 productive capacity. To realize its modernization
 goals, however, the Chinese leadership is count-
 ing on substantial payoffs from new and im-
 proved systems of economic management.
 It is in the realm of planning and management
 that recent initiatives contrast most sharply with
 the practices of the past 10 years. Current
 economic policies in many ways resemble, in
 their demonstration of flexibility and pragma-
 tism, policies that were discussed and experi-
 mented with during the early 1960s, before the
 Cultural Revolution. Then, as now, a leadership
 headed by economic moderates faced the prob-
 lems of rebuilding a weakened economy and
 establishing new organizational and incentive
 structures more supportive of future growth. In
 recent months Peking has taken measures to
 restore peak levels of productivity and to improve
 the efficiency of resource use. New initiatives are
 most apparent in the areas of wages and incen-
 tives, factory management, planning and organi-
 zation, and in policy toward science and technol-
 ogy. The political and ideological relaxation that
 has followed the purge of the Gang also extends
 to economic discussion, and prominent econo-
 mists are again playing a role in public affairs.
 Wage Reform
 Peking's success in bolstering economic growth
 during the remainder of the Fifth Plan period
 depends heavily on its ability to improve work
 incentives and boost labor productivity. When
 the present government took office in October
 1976, it faced a disgruntled work force which
 since 1974 had increasingly resorted to slow-
 downs, absenteeism, and strikes to protest low
 wages and eroding living standards. One year
 later, with low morale and low productivity still
 serious problems, the new leadership announced
 pay increases for three-fifths of the urban labor
 force, stressing that the improved economic situ-
 ation made it possible to raise wages. None-
 theless, everyone realized that the move was
 intended to buy time until a more thorough
 consideration of wage policy was possible.
 The pay hike probably has had a beneficial
 impact on work discipline and, therefore, on
 productivity.  However, the wage increase-
 amounting to some 10 to 15 percent for the
 lowest paid workers and around 10 percent over-
 all-is probably regarded by many as in-
 adequate. The abolition of production bonuses in
 the late 1960s (which cut personal incomes of
 industrial workers by approximately 10 percent),
 followed by a period of essentially unchanging
 wages and larger-than-normal price increases,
 resulted in serious losses of purchasing power
 which the wage increase leaves largely unre-
 stored. In view of the magnitude of discontent
 over wages and living conditions, any substantial
 improvement in work incentives-and produc-
 tivity-will  require  further  concessions  by
 Peking.
 The current leadership recognizes the need for
 a comprehensive wage reform which in addition
 to raising pay rates and sanctioning the use of
 production bonuses and piece rates, would, inter

 Approved For Release 2004/02/23 : CIA-RDP80T00702A000500060015-4
 alia, establish rules governing eligibility for and
 regularity of promotions. This may involve no
 more than enforcing existing regulations-regu-
 lations that have been widely ignored during the
 past decade.
 The basic problem, however, is in deciding just
 how much wages should be raised; or, whether
 bonus and piece rate systems-or some combina-
 tion of the three-may be more effective in
 raising labor productivity. And these decisions
 must be coordinated with plans for consumer
 goods production and imports. The apparent
 inaction on wage reform may signify that Peking
 is hoping that the small wage increase granted in
 1977, along with the introduction of bonuses and
 piece rates and some improvements in living
 conditions,' will reduce worker dissatisfaction
 (that is, raise labor productivity) to an accept-
 able level.
 Hua Kuo-feng's remarks at the National
 People's Congress last February ended any
 doubts that the leadership plans to make greater
 use of material incentives. Hua said that the staff
 and workers of state enterprises should be paid
 "primarily on a time-rate basis with piecework
 playing a secondary role, and with additional
 bonuses."' He also indicated that preparations
 for a reform of the wage system were under way.'
 The length of Hua's comments on wages and
 living conditions is revealing. Past references to
 'A report prepared for the State Council in 1975 cited the need
 to (a) build more dormitories for workers; (b) improve the opera-
 tion of mess halls, nurseries, and medical services; (c) improve the
 organization of spare-time educational, cultural, recreational, and
 sports activities; and (d) solve the problem of husbands .and wives
 working in separate places for long periods.
 ' It is interesting that piece rates, generally opposed by labor,
 seem to be welcomed by Chinese workers. Apparently, production
 norms are sufficiently low that the additional effort required to
 increase earnings is relatively unimportant after years of low and
 unchanging wages with little or no opportunity to supplement wages
 by production bonuses or overtime.
 Hua's further remarks on the necessity of increasing the supply
 of nonstaple foodstuffs to urban consumers seem to confirm that
 inadequate supplies of nonstaple foodstuffs have in recent years
 been a difficult problem and perhaps an important source of worker
 dissatisfaction. That he also called for improvements in housing,
 both for urban and rural residents, is not surprising, since lack of
 adequate housing has always been a problem. His remark, however,
 suggests that housing inadequacies have been a source of particular
 aggravation in recent years.
 these topics by members of the leadership have
 been brief and for the most part noncommittal
 statements to the effect that, as production in-
 creased, consumption and living standards would
 increase accordingly. Hua's remarks are further
 confirmation of the pressures being exerted by
 Chinese consumers and of the leadership's recog-
 nition that these demands can no longer be
 ignored or turned aside by ideological con-
 demnation of material incentives and appeals to
 patriotism. The 12-percent annual rate of growth
 planned for light industry during 1976-85-
 2 percentage points higher than for industry as a
 whole-and the apparent decision to import con-
 sumer goods when excess demand becomes a
 problem are examples of the type of policy that
 can be expected from Peking.
 Strengthening Enterprise Management
 Almost two years after the purge of the Gang
 of Four, and despite continuing efforts by the
 leadership, enterprise management remains in a
 state of confusion. Last year the First Ministry of
 Machine Building promoted a campaign to im-
 prove product quality. Surveying results at the
 end of the year, it found that only about 20
 percent of the enterprises had achieved marked
 results, that about 60 percent "did some work,
 but their efforts were not vigorous, earnest, and
 meticulous-and thus produced only fair re-
 sults," and that the remaining 20 percent "either
 carried out their work perfunctorily or did noth-
 ing at all."
 Kiangsu Province in June reported on its at-
 tempts to improve product quality and reduce
 materials consumption during the first five
 months of this year. Of 33 products examined for
 quality, 28 showed improvements over 1977, but
 only seven reached the highest quality levels
 attained in earlier years. "Materials and other"
 consumption indexes for 43 products were exam-
 ined: 37 were lower than last year, but only 10
 reached previous lows.
 These are evidently typical experiences, for in
 July a People's Daily editorial complained of
 "numerous problems" in management, and a
 circular issued by the State Economic Commis-
 Approved For Release 2004/02/23 : CIA-RDP80T00702A000500060015-4
 Approved For Release 2004/02/23 : CIA-RDP80T00702A000500060015-4
 sion-announcing that September would be the
 first "quality month" for industry and communi-
 cations-said that "the trend toward a worsening
 of product quality has been changed somewhat,
 but the low quality of products remains a serious
 problem."
 The intractability of these problems has forced
 Peking to devote more time to management
 issues and has hastened the adoption of two
 important measures. Following Hua Kuo-feng's
 announcement of the decision at the National
 People's Congress, Peking has begun to abolish
 enterprise "revolutionary committees." These
 were formed during the Cultural Revolution to
 assume the tasks previously handled by party
 committees and enterprise managers. Apparently
 they became the loci of bureaucratic infighting
 and, collectively, a source of industrial disorder.
 Greater control of operations is now being vested
 in individual managers (under the direction of
 local party committees) whose authorities and
 responsibilities are now more extensive and clear-
 cut.
 With the elimination of revolutionary commit-
 tees in production units, Peking has mounted a
 concerted attempt to restore the systems needed
 for effective management, for example, financial
 and quality controls, material consumption
 norms, and the like. The most recent, important
 development in this area has been the issuance in
 April of the Central Committee document, the
 30-Point Decision on Industry.' The People's
 Daily editorial announcing the action called the
 document the "fundamental law" for industrial
 and communications enterprises, which, it said,
 "provides a basis to eliminate chaos, restore
 order, and set things straight from the bottom
 up." The editorial went on to describe the docu-
 ment: "It specifically defines a series of princi-
 ples and policies on tasks and basic regulations
 for enterprises, methods and work styles, and
 ways of improving industrial management and
 quickening the pace of industrial development."
 'The full title is Decision of the Central Committee of the
 Chinese Communist Party Concerning Some Problems in Speeding
 Up the Development of Industry (draft). The document is not yet
 available outside China. However, New China News Agency has
 published a list of the major points; these are listed in the appendix.
 The 30 Points represents a major accomplish-
 ment in the lengthy attempt to bring order to the
 economy. In recounting the history of this strug-
 gle, and of the document, People's Daily pointed
 out that it retains "many" good points from the
 70-Point Decision on Industry promulgated in
 the early 1960s, the 10 Points of 1972, and the
 1975 document referred to as the 20 Points.
 The appearance of the 30 Points, bearing the
 imprimatur of the Central Committee, should
 help dispel the misgivings of managers and
 middle- and lower-level functionaries who thus
 far have been reluctant-for fear of a sudden
 change in policy that would make them targets
 for leftists-to implement the policies of the new
 government. Indicating that not even this action
 is expected to completely allay the fears of lower
 level officials, People's Daily cautioned that,
 "Due to the longtime ideological confusion
 caused by the Gang of Four, we may encounter
 some ideological obstacles during this trial
 implementation."
 The 30-Point Decision on Industry is mainly
 concerned with immediate productivity increases
 and the reestablishment of familiar institutions
 and practices which can be expected to have a
 positive impact on efficiency. Perhaps more sig-
 nificant over the long run is Peking's curiosity
 and questioning about managerial techniques
 used in other countries with vastly different
 economic systems--implying that China's lead-
 ers are considering further, perhaps major,
 changes in the economic system.10 In the most
 publicized instance, they have shown consider-
 able interest in the Yugoslav system; but the list
 of countries where official Chinese visitors have
 displayed more than a passing interest in man-
 agement extends to Japan, several countries in
 Western Europe, and Romania." There is noth-
 ing to suggest what changes Peking may have in
 mind, but the flexibility that such a search

 JUG interview with the economist Sun Yeh-fang in the Foreign
 Broadcast Information Service Daily Report: People's Republic of

 implies is remarkable when one considers the
 ideological rigidity that has constrained public
 discussion and policy during much of the past 10
 years.
 Changes in Planning and Organization
 Paralleling Peking's attempts to strengthen
 enterprise management are moves to tighten
 central control and to raise economic efficiency.
 It would probably be inaccurate to character-
 ize what is happening as a return to strong
 control by the center. Rather, it seems more
 likely that current developments are first of all a
 reaction to the extreme de facto decentralization
 that occurred amidst the chaos of the early
 1970s 12 and secondly a reawakening of the de-
 sire-apparent in 1964-65 and now given new
 impetus by plans for modernization-to improve
 efficiency. Peking since the late 1950s has dis-
 played an understanding and acceptance of the
 importance of local initiative in tackling its
 economic problems; and there is no evidence that
 anyone in the leadership is now arguing that
 authority over the economy should be concen-
 trated, in whole or in large part, in Peking."
 After all, many of China's 29 provincial units
 have populations that are larger than all but a
 few countries. And the Chinese, if anyone,
 should be aware of the problems which ensue
 from a large central bureaucracy.
 "A de jure decentralization of sorts-probably administrative
 only-took place in 1970, perhaps in association with the rapid
 growth of local small industry at that time. But there is no evidence
 that the provisions enacted were extreme or opposed by anyone in
 the current leadership.
 13 For example, Hua Kuo-feng's speech to the National People's
 Congress contains the following passage: "Given the strengthening
 of unified central leadership, it is necessary to develop the initiative
 of both the central and local authorities. While the former must
 have absolute control on major issues, power should devolve on the
 latter with respect to minor ones. Power is to be centralized where
 necessary, while active support is to be given to the local authorities
 in undertaking what should be put in their charge." In this instance
 Hua's emphasis is on more central control, but the passage is-also
 meant to reaffirm Peking's commitment to an administratively
 decentralized control system. Remarks by the prominent economist
 Sun Yeh-fang in an August interview with a TANJUG corespond-
 ent suggest that even now, while strengthening central control,
 Peking may be contemplating reforms which extend the authorities
 of enterprise managers.
 In  what  appears  to  be  one  recent
 manifestation of the strengthening of central
 control, the number of ministries under the State
 Council has been expanded. Whereas in 1975 a
 single ministry was responsible for fuels and
 chemicals, now there are separate ministries for
 coal, petroleum, and chemicals. Similarily, indi-
 vidual ministries have been reestablished to gov-
 ern the textile industry and the railroads. The
 appearance of additional ministries by itself does
 not necessarily signify stronger central control;
 but given the frequency of editorial commentary
 in the official press calling for more unified
 planning and coordination, it is reasonable to
 assume that the new ministries reflect steps in
 this direction.
 Another sign of the tightening of control, but
 obviously much more complex in its intentions
 and implications, is the apparently imminent
 reestablishment of the six economic regions into
 which China's 29 provincial units once were
 grouped for planning purposes. While we know
 very little about how this regional framework
 operated in the past, oblique references by Hua
 Kuo-feng and Yu Ch'iu-li to regional economic
 systems in each of the six major regions suggest
 that a regional setup is being revived to facilitate
 long-term planning and to strengthen control of
 the economy at an intermediate level between the
 provinces and Peking.
 Other new organizations have also appeared,
 perhaps connected with the attempt to reassert a
 greater measure of central control, but more
 obviously associated with the desire to improve
 efficiency. Particularly noteworthy was the rees-
 tablishment last year of the National Petroleum
 Corporation, which reportedly has taken over
 operational responsibility for the oil industry,
 leaving the Ministry of Petroleum Industry
 charged mainly with policy formulation. A min-
 isterial-corporate structure of this sort also may
 figure in the reorganization announced for the
 agricultural machine industry. Similar corpora-
 tions were set up in these and several other
 industries in 1964-65 but were later abolished
 after condemnation by radicals as "capitalist
 monopoly trusts."

 Although details are sketchy, the corporate
 idea seems to have two rationales. As described
 in 1964-65, the corporations and enterprises un-
 der their control were to be relatively free of
 interference from local authorities; especially in
 matters of policy, they were to be accountable
 only to the central authorities in Peking. In
 addition, such enterprises would be "specialized"
 rather than "all-inclusive," making it possible to
 reduce costly duplication in organization, person-
 nel, and fixed assets.
 In July New China News Agency reported
 that the First Ministry of Machine Building was
 reorganizing its affiliated departments and enter-
 prises along lines of specialization "to improve
 coordination and planning." This form of organi-
 zation had been tried in 1964, NCNA noted.
 Reforms had recently begun in Peking and
 Shanghai, and the Ministry had dispatched per-
 sonnel to aid in the reorganization to a number of
 provinces." A farm machinery corporation was
 set up for the northwest region of the country,
 with factories in Shensi, Kansu, Ninghsia, and
 Sinkiang Provinces designated to produce parts
 and accessories.
 The emphasis on efficiency extends to military
 industries. Both Yu Ch'iu-li and Hua Kuo-feng
 have signaled the leadership's intentions to,
 where possible, "integrate" military and civilian
 enterprises. Presumably the objective is to make
 idle or underutilized capacity in military plants
 available for civilian use and to more carefully
 scrutinize those military resource allocations that
 could be used for civilian purposes.
 Renewed Emphasis on Expertise
 Meeting the human capital requirements of a
 modernization program would be difficult under
 the best of circumstances; now, the "crisis" in
 education and science is perhaps the major ob-
 stacle to the fulfillment of China's goals.
 Reestablishing an educational system capable
 of turning out well-prepared graduates, like most
 of the tasks facing Peking, will take several
 14 NCNA cited Liaoning, Kiangsi, Shantung, Honan, and the
 northwest.
 years. The logistics alone are formidable. Al-
 though undergraduate enrollment is rapidly be-
 ing expanded, it remains below pre-Cultural
 Revolution levels. Post graduate education will
 resume in the fall of 1978, but with an enroll-
 ment of only 9,000. One of Peking's responses to
 the protracted nature of the restoration process
 has been to reinstitute a system of "key" schools
 whereby resources are concentrated on a limited
 number of highly qualified students who will
 form the nucleus of the scientific and technical
 contingent required for modernization. The deci-
 sion has also been made to send literally thou-
 sands of students abroad for training at the
 undergraduate as well as graduate levels. The
 realization that resources" must be concentrated
 on a limited number of high-priority objectives
 also is evident in discussions of the plans for
 scientific and technical work.
 For the past year and a half, Peking has been
 considering the directions its science policy
 should take. Two major planning conferences
 were held in late 1977 and early 1978-one for
 natural sciences, the other for more general
 scientific and technical matters-prior to the
 National Science Conference, held in March
 1978. There, amid much fanfare and speeches by
 top party leaders, a draft science plan for 1978-
 85 was presented. The plan is broad in scope,
 covering everything from very basic consider-
 ations on education to foreign training for Chi-
 nese scientists and the areas of research to be
 tackled during the next eight years.
 Fang Yi, head of the State Scientific and
 Technological Commission, earlier had an-
 nounced that research work was to focus on a
 number of key problems in industry, agriculture,
 and national defense. In his discussion at the
 March conference, Fang elaborated on those
 problems. He focused on eight areas of research,
 three of which relate directly to industry: energy,
 materials, and computers. Touching in turn upon
 oil, coal, and electric power-all of which are
 priority concerns--Fang also brought up the
 need to explore new sources of energy, mention-
 ing first the need to step up research on nuclear
 energy. In materials research, he cited metal-

 lurgy, holding up the needs of the steel industry,
 in particular the beneficiation of hematite, as an
 item of top priority; Fang also mentioned a
 number of nonferrous metals industries where
 research is needed to solve technical problems.
 His discussion of research on computers simply
 noted the large number of areas where comput-
 ers are valuable tools and declared Peking's
 intentions to build a "fair-sized" computer indus-
 try by 1985. The discussion of agricultural re-
 search covered a wide range of topics, reflecting
 the general technological backwardness of Chi-
 nese agriculture.
 The new leadership is keenly aware of the
 importance of scientific-technical work to Chi-
 na's modernization. Despite added spending on
 science and technology, shortages of research
 personnel and educators will persist for some
 time. The recognition that this is so is reflected in
 the careful attention to the needs of agriculture,
 industry, and national defense over the next eight
 years and the concentration of scientific re-
 sources on a limited number of projects with a
 reasonable possibility of quick payoffs.
 with another prominent rehabilitee, Hsu Ti-hsin
 (now head of ERI), and a third economist,
 Kuang Jih-an, presided over a series of regional
 economic planning forums. In addition to holding
 discussions of current economic conditions and
 the 10-year plan, forum participants also dis-
 cussed ongoing research and proposed topics for
 future work. The proposed topics, as reported by
 New China News Agency, presage a movement
 away from the "quote Mao, quote Marx" eco-
 nomics that had become standard fare in recent
 years. This change is beginning to be seen in the
 journal Economic Research which resumed pub-
 lication this year after a decade-long hiatus.
 Hsueh Mu-ch'iao is another rehabilitee of
 note. He once headed the State Statistical Bu-
 reau, was a deputy on the State Planning Com-
 mission, and was head of the National Price
 Commission. Hsueh's current role is unknown;
 he has been noted in attendance at important
 functions, and some of his writings from the
 1950s have been republished-for no apparent
 reason except perhaps to notify the bureaucracy
 of his return.
 Reappearance of Prominent Economic Officials
 Among the signs of a budding economic lib-
 eralism are the rehabilitation of once-disgraced
 economic officials and the promise of a return to
 more substantive economic discourse.
 Perhaps most symbolic of Peking's about face
 in economic policies is the reappearance of
 economist Sun Yeh-fang. During the Cultural
 Revolution, Sun--a former director of the State
 Statistical Bureau and once head of the Eco-
 nomic Research Institute of the Academy of
 Sciences-was denounced as "China's Liber-
 man" for advocating study of Yugoslavia's use of
 profits as a management tool. The vehemence of
 the attacks on Sun made his rehabilitation in
 1.977 as remarkable as Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-
 p'ing's reappearance in 1973.
 Sun since April has been an adviser to the
 Economic Research Institute where he shares
 responsibility for restoring and planning China's
 economic research effort." In May, he, along

 economic reforms, see the interview by TANJUG correspondent
 Aleksandr Novacic in FBIS, August 23, 1978, pp. A/26-28.
 Widening Role for Foreign Technology
 Just as China is looking abroad for models of
 managerial efficiency, so are its planners turning
 to the foreign sector for acquisitions of modern
 plants and technology. With investment priorities
 now generally established, extensive negotiations
 are under way with Japanese and Western firms
 for a new wave of technology imports that should
 continue for the next several years.
 Complete industrial plants top the shopping
 list. Major interest centers on facilities for the
 steel, electric power, petrochemicals, and fertil-
 izer industries. Inquiries also have been made for
 plants producing nonferrous metals, locomotives,
 trucks, and electronic components. In addition to
 whole plants, the Chinese have shown great
 interest in purchasing specialized machinery and
 equipment, particularly items needed by the fuel
 industries. Computers and telecommunications
 equipment also are high on the list.
 Despite Peking's new overtures, however, tech-
 nical and financial constraints restrict the scope
 of any drive to expand technology imports. While

 Approved For Release 2004/02/23 : CIA-RDP80T00702A000500060015-4
 a sizable army of middle-level factory techni-
 cians has been spawned by China's "learning by
 doing" approach to industrial training, there is a
 serious shortage of experienced design and pro-
 duction engineers and other highly trained tech-
 nicians essential in setting up and operating a
 modern factory. Even with the new emphasis on
 expertise, a resolution of this problem is bound to
 take a very long time.
 A major financial constraint is China's limited
 capacity to earn foreign exchange. Credits and
 other forms of import financing can smooth the
 repayment obligations, but ultimately higher lev-
 els of exports are needed. Many traditional ex-
 ports depend directly on the backward agricul-
 tural sector, and the past failure to invest in
 mining and processing of metals and minerals
 forces China to import many of the goods that it
 should be able to export. Technical problems and
 rapidly increasing domestic demand will con-
 strain exports of petroleum. Nevertheless, as
 Peking progresses with its modernization plans,
 China is likely to evolve new methods of financ-
 ing foreign purchases. These methods may take
 the form of greater acceptance of foreign debt
 and widening interest in generating new sources
 of export earnings.
 In recent months, for example, Chinese offi-
 cials have been considering trade and financing
 arrangements that they would not even discuss
 previously: (a) long-term credits and the financ-
 ing of capital imports through foreign bank
 deposits with the Bank of China; (b) barter and
 compensation deals for plant purchases; (c) the
 importing of materials to reprocess for export;
 (d) designation of certain factories to produce
 goods for specific foreign markets; and (e) fuller
 compliance with international standards on pat-
 ents, trademarks, and copyrights. There has also
 been some talk of cooperative ventures with
 foreign oil firms to develop China's offshore oil
 resources. How far Peking is willing to pursue
 these more adventurous trade and finance prac-
 tices is unclear. Stated policy still precludes
 direct loans, joint ventures, and foreign invest-
 ment. The leadership likely will introduce these
 more flexible practices on a selective basis, rede-
 fining self-reliance to justify their actions, but
 not abandoning the basic principle.
 COMPETING NEEDS AND
 POLICY CHOICES
 Productivity gains play such an integral role in
 the 10-year plan that the deftness with which
 Peking handles related topics like wage reform,
 bonus schemes, and consumer goods markets will
 have a major impact on the success of the plan.
 The sensitivity of the wage issue and the possibil-
 ity that by responding to worker demands the
 leadership may be contributing to an incipient
 consumerism have wide-ranging implications
 that will be discussed at length by the Politburo.
 The very fact that these problems are by and
 large unfamiliar to the leadership makes unlikely
 their quick and efficient resolution. And it in-
 creases the possibility that misjudgments will
 further jeopardize plan goals.
 In earlier years, Peking could concentrate on
 maximizing the rate of investment and output
 growth, while avoiding bottlenecks and inflation-
 ary pressures. Consumer needs were not ignored;
 but the consumer was made to understand that,
 at least for the time being, growth in personal
 real incomes had to remain small. Because the
 price level generally was kept under control, a
 small annual increase in wages was acceptable to
 the work force. Open complaints were very infre-
 quent and work slowdowns, absenteeism, and
 strikes were practically unheard of. This is no
 longer the case.
 Workers learned during the Cultural Revolu-
 tion that they could express their economic griev-
 ances with a degree of impunity and effectiveness
 that was previously unsuspected. The abolition of
 production bonuses in the late 1960s (which cut
 personal incomes of industrial workers by ap-
 proximately 10 percent) followed by a period of
 essentially unchanging wages and larger-than-
 normal price increases turned minor grievances
 into serious labor problems. Government inaction
 resulted in a variety of job actions and a sharp
 decline in labor productivity.
 Peking not only has to face up to the problems
 of lost purchasing power and wage reform, but it
 must also convince the worker that this govern-
 ment is fair and can be trusted. First and most
 important, however, it must come up with a
 package of wage increases and bonuses that
 significantly increases incomes, and it must en-

 Approved For Release 2004/02/23 : CIA-RDP80T00702A000500060015-4
 sure the availability of goods at prices that leave
 the worker with real gains.
 In the next year or two, consumption increases
 can be achieved by tapping unused capacity in
 light industry and restoring order to markets,
 especially those for nonstaple foods. Productivity
 growth in response to the wage increase in late
 1.977 and in anticipation of further wage adjust-
 ments will also provide for some increases in
 consumption.
 Beyond 1980 and until the current investment
 program is completed, more than moderate gains
 in consumption seem unlikely. Investments in
 agriculture are being substantially increased.
 Since foodstuffs account for about one-half of
 consumer expenditures, increases in agricultural
 investment imply gains in consumption. And
 because a large share of the raw materials used
 in light industry also comes from the agricultural
 sector, growth in industrial consumer goods out-
 put should also improve. Agriculture, however, is
 fickle; without favorable weather, investment
 may not yield the anticipated growth-particu-
 larly if one is looking for a payoff within the
 relatively short period of five to 10 years. When
 discounted for variation in weather and the
 complexities of agricultural development, the
 agricultural component of investment can be
 expected to yield only moderate gains in output
 and consumption growth.
 Light industrial output is to grow by 150
 percent during 1978-85, an average annual rate
 of slightly more than 12 percent. Comments by
 the head of the State Planning Commission and
 by officials in the Ministry of Light Industry
 indicate, however, that these gains are intended
 to come largely from fuller utilization of capacity
 and more efficient use of inputs, not from invest-
 ments in new capacity. Our estimate of growth in
 consumer goods production shows an average
 annual rate of growth of 7 to 8 percent since
 1957. This falls so far short of the planned 12
 percent that one has to be skeptical of Peking's
 ability to achieve its goal without massive addi-
 tions to capacity.
 The growth of per capita consumption will also
 be constrained by yearly population increases of
 1 to 2 percentand by exports of consumer goods.
 Foodstuffs and light industrial products account
 for over 50 percent of total exports. Raw materi-
 als, particularly crude oil and coal, are to become
 an increasing share of exports, but until the mid-
 1980s when current investments in those sectors
 really begin to pay off, foodstuffs and light
 industrial goods will continue to be important
 export items.
 All of this suggests that, Peking may find itself
 still faced with labor problems and lagging pro-
 ductivity throughout the 10-year plan. If it turns
 out that moderate consumption gains will not
 induce the productivity gains implicit in plan
 goals, then Peking may be forced to cut back on
 its investment in heavy industry, something that
 would be done only reluctantly.
 The defense budget cannot be regarded as a
 significant source of transferable funds. Cuts in
 defense spending in the early 1970s (with no
 evidence of substantially larger expenditures
 since) and the real need for a costly program to
 modernize conventional forces have probably
 been cited in arguments for an increase in mili-
 tary budgets. However, in the debate last year on
 military spending, the Hua regime argued that a
 strong defense requires a modern industrial base.
 The debate apparently ended with a consensus
 (1) to hold military spending at a level which
 allows for the most essential aspects of defense
 modernization and (2) to make underutilized
 resources controlled by the military partially
 available for civilian industry. The impression is
 that much of the resources which are transfer-
 able to civilian use has already been-or soon
 will be-tapped, lessening the possibility for
 significant resource transfers during 1981-85.
 Peking is showing less reluctance to rely on the
 foreign sector, and it conceivably could invite
 additional foreign investment in its consumer
 goods industries; but such arrangements could
 hardly provide a significant share of the needed
 increase in consumer goods production. Simi-
 larly, further efforts to improve efficiency, if
 successful, would seem to offer the hope of only
 marginal gains in the output of consumer goods.
 When one considers the political as well as the
 economic difficulties that China's modernizers
 are likely to encounter, the undertaking they

 Considerable controversy appears inevitable-
 not only over basic policy changes certainly but
 also over the nuts-and-bolts issues of implemen-
 tation that affect the political and economic
 status of bureaucrats and bureaucracies. Never-
 theless, Peking seems capable of resolving these
 difficulties in ways that will allow satisfactory
 gains in per capita consumption and, at the same
 time, permit rates of investment and industrial
 growth that are reasonably close to plan goals.
 In short, the 10-year plan is likely to be a
 successful first step toward the modernization of
 China's economy.
