 VIETNAM
 Pare-Tet Viet Cong attacks directed against US airfields
 inflicted only minor damage.   There are indications of
 a sizable buildup of enemy main-force elements in the
 northern provinces and possible post-Tet attacks in
 this area.   The Constituent Assembly adjourned for a
 ten-day Tet holiday and postponed consideration of im-
 portant issues such as the powers of the proposed leg-
 islature.   Hanoi insists that its foreign minister's
 recent offer to consider talks if the US will stop the
 bombings is a "serious gesture of good will" which
 the US ignored.   Peking,  impervious to North Vietnam-
 ese sensitivies,                            has carried its anti-Soviet agitation
 to Hanoi.
 COMMUNIST CHINA
 Maoist leaders seem to be intensifying their drive
 against opponents throughout the country, but it is
 not clear that they are making much headway.   In some
 localities the armed forces seem to have sided with
 Mao's opposition.   Difficulties in the army seem to
 have hurt the standing of Defense Minister Lin Piao.
 CHINESE STEP UP ANTI-SOVIET CAMPAIGN
 The harassment of Soviet personnel still in China, now
 in its third week,  is designed to goad Moscow into a
 diplomatic break.   Peking's aim is not only to bolster
 its "cultural revolution" by uniting the Chinese
 against a foreign enemy,  but also to complicate Soviet
 problems connected with the Vietnamese war.
 ANTI-SUKARNO CAMPAIGN IN INDONESIA GAINS MOMENTUM
 Most Indonesians no longer debate whether the Presi-
 dent should be removed, but how to accomplish the oust-
 er.   Appointment  of  108 new members of parliament has
 strengthened the anti-Sukarno forces.

 FAR EAST
 The dramatic deterioration of Communist China's
 relations with the Soviet Union has tended to over-
 shadow further Chinese domestic fireworks.   The
 abuse heaped upon the departing dependents of So-
 viet diplomats and the concerted harassment of the
 remaining officials suggest that the Chinese are
 trying to force the Soviets to close their embassy.
 As the pressure in Peking increases, the Soviets
 will have great difficulty maintaining their pres-
 ence there.
 In the struggle between supporters and oppo-
 nents of Mao Tse-tung, the shakiness of Mao's mili-
 tary backing continues to be evident
 Almost daily exhorta-
 tions to supposed followers of Mao to unify them-
 selves so as better to oppose the "handful in power"
 betray their disarray.   The formation of "communes"
 --patterned on the short-lived Paris commune of
 1871--to rule Shanghai and several provinces is the
 regime's latest improvisation in the effort to re-
 gain clear control.
 In South Vietnam, the New Year holidays have
 brought a pause both in military action and consti-
 tution-making.   Hanoi is extending its campaign to
 persuade the US that peace talks could begin if the
 bombing of North Vietnam were ended.
 In Indonesia,  pressures continue to mount for
 the ouster of President Sukarno, with even some
 leaders of his once reliable National Party adding
 their voices to the chorus.   Final action might
 come through the policy-making Provisional People's
 Consultative Assembly, which is scheduled to meet
 next month.

 VI ETNAM
 Both military and political
 activity in Vietnam has slowed
 down with the beginning of the
 five-day lunar new year celebra-
 tions  (Tet)  on the morning of 8
 February.
 Pre-Tet military activity
 initiated by the Viet Conq was
 highlighted by four attacks
 against US airfields in South
 Vietnam on 6 and 7   February.
 Three of the raids--those at
 Binh Thuy, Tra Cu, and Tra Noc
 in the Mekong Delta--caused few
 casualties and only minor damage
 to the installations.   The fourth,
 against a US Army airstrip in cen?-
 t.ral Binh Dinh Province known as
 "English Airfield," resulted in
 casualties of one killed and 59
 wounded.
 Shortly before the truce
 the Viet Cong destroyed more than
 $5 million worth of ordnance at
 the Long Binh ammunition dump
 northeast of Saigon and nearly
 150,000 gallons of napalm at. the
 Bien Hoa Air Base.
 Six US Army battalions of
 Operation GADSDEN, reported sev-
 eral heavy engagements with enemy
 forces while sweeping the western
 section of the long-time Commu-
 nist sanctuary known as War Zone
 "C"  in northern Tay Ninh Province..
 There have been continuing
 :indications of possible Communist
 troop deployments in the northern
 provinces.   There are also re-
 ports of Communist units moving
 south from Quang Tri and Thua
 Thien provinces into Quang Ngai
 Province.
 Enemy strength in Quang Ngai
 Province is now estimated to be
 as high as 15 main-force bat-
 talions,  and several indicators
 point to enemy preparations for
 offensive operations in this
 province in the near future--a
 recent rallier stated that Quang
 Ngai would soon become a "major
 battlefield."   Possible objec-
 tives include the Special Forces
 camps scattered throughout the
 province and/or US Marine and
 South Korean base camp areas.
 At the same time, a con-
 tinuing high level of truck traf-
 fic has moved southward on the
 Laotian panhandle's infiltration
 road network.   Nearly 500 ve-
 hicles were observed entering
 Laos from North Vietnam during
 the first three weeks of Janu-
 ary--a level of activity al-
 most comparable to last year's

 gan in October.
 South Vietnamese Politics
 South Vietnam's Constituent
 Assembly adjourned on 3 February
 for about ten days without hav-
 ing begun discussions on the more
 significant aspects of legisla-
 tive power in the future govern-
 ment.
 Some public criticism of the as-
 sembly's work, echoing that of
 military leaders and given
 prominent coverage in the gov-
 ernment-controlled press, has
 irritated the assemblymen, but
 apparently not to the extent of
 seriously damaging their relations
 with the government.
 Hanoi on Negotiations
 Hanoi propaganda has con-
 tinued to press for a permanent
 cessation of the bombings.   On
 5 February the party daily news-
 papers underscored the signifi-
 cance of recent North Vietnamese
 offers to consider talks with
 the US in exchange for a cessa-
 tion of the air strikes and chal-
 lenged President Johnson's 2
 February statement that there
 had been no "serious effort by
 the other side."   Hanoi charac-
 terized Foreign Minister Nguyen
 Duy Trinh's 28 January inter-
 view expressing a willingness
 to talk as a "serious effort
 full of good will" and charged
 that the US had ignored it.   In
 another commentary, on 7 Febru-
 ary, Hanoi publicly denied that
 "secret talks" were being held
 with the US.   The commentary
 called such talks "ambigious
 rumor" and "sheer fabrication."

 demonstrations in front of So-
 viet embassies to Hanoi for the
 first time on 30 January.   Al-
 though both the Soviet and the
 Chinese press reported the dem-
 onstrations, Hanoi authorities
 refused to allow any local re-
 lease of the news.   The demon-
 strators were "gently dispersed,"
 Local authorities sup-
 pressed the French AFP corres-
 pondent's dispatch.   The next
 day's edition of the local Chi-
 nese-language daily was delayed,
 possibly because of censorship
 problems.
 Peking may also have en-
 gaged in some limited "obstruc-
 tionism" in connection with So-
 viet aid personnel.   The Soviet
 press charges that the Chinese
 harassed Soviet technicians en
 route to Hanoi at the Peking
 Airport.
 COMMUNIST CHINA
 The supporters of Mao Tse-
 tung seem to be intensifying their
 drive against opponents through-
 out China, but in spite of numer-
 ous claims of victory it is un-
 clear how much headway they are
 really making.   In some areas
 army forces appear to have sided
 with Mao's opposition in party
 organizations.   This is not sur-
 prising since the local party boss
 usually is political commissar
 of army units in his jurisdiction
 and has a higher party rank than
 the local. military commander.
 In Sinkiang and Tibet the
 party chieftain is concurrently
 the military commander.   Opposi-
 Page 5
 tion to Mao has been especially
 stubborn in these two provinces.
 According to posters, pro-Mao
 Red Guards have been attack-
 ing Sinkiang boss Wang En-mao for
 five months and Chang Kuo-hua,
 top man in Tibet,  for about
 two months.
 Maoist forces may be gain-
 ing the upper hand in Sinkiang.
 The Urumchi radio station has
 been broadcasting vitriolic at-
 tacks on the Sinkiang party com-
 mittee since about the first of
 February, when propaganda media
 were apparently taken over by
 pro-Mao forces.   Posters seen
 in Peking claim that Wang has

 been in Peking for six weeks
 "consulting" with Premier Chou
 En-lai.
 A wall poster seen in Peking
 on 7 February reported that "reac-
 tionary" army troops in six Szech-
 wan cities had been suppressing
 "revolutionaries."   The troops
 were said to be led by political
 commissars of the Cheng-tu Mili-
 tary Region  (Szechwan
 Province)
 who are
 responsive to
 Li Ching-
 chuan,
 first political
 commis-
 sar of
 the region and
 first sec-
 retary
 of the Southwest party
 bureau.
 Other posters have reported
 recent clashes between troops
 and Maoist militants in Honan
 Province and in the Mukden
 (Liaoning, Kirin, and Heilung-
 kiang provinces),  Inner Mongolian,
 Tsinan  (Shantung) and Canton
 (Kwangtung, Hunan, and Kwangsi)
 military regions.   Such reports
 appear to be designed to dis-
 credit local military commanders
 and may be a prelude to their
 dismissal.   There is no evi-
 dence that pitched battles be-
 tween army factions have oc-
 curred anywhere.
 The drive to discredit and
 bring down military leaders con-
 tinues to be pushed in Peking,
 as well as in the provinces.   Mao
 Tse-tung is reported in a poster
 to have complained to the Mili-
 tary Affairs Committee on 27
 Page 6
 January that many "old leaders"
 in the army did not understand
 his revolutionary objectives.
 Fresh posters have gone up
 in the past week attacking Yang
 Yung,  commander of the crucial
 Peking Military Region  (which
 includes Shansi and Hopeh prov-
 inces),  and many other military
 figures.   It is now fairly cer-

 Mao at a Red Guard rally.

 endorsed only four of the take-
 overs--in the provinces of
 Shansi, Kweichow,                         and Heilung-
 kiang and in the Shanghai munic-
 ipality.   New organizations
 modleled on the Paris Commune of
 1871 have been established in
 these areas to replace party
 committees, but it remains to be
 seen whether they can consolidate
 control and operate effectively.
 Peking's failure to acknowl-
 edge victory claims by six pro-
 vincial radios suggests either
 that it is not satisfied that
 those making the announcements
 are genuinely pro-Mao, or be-
 lieves that the announcements
 were premature.   The seizure
 pronouncements issued by "revo-
 lutionaries" in Kwangsi and Kansu
 provinces did not use the harsh
 language characteristic of gen-
 uine pro-Mao forces in attacking
 local party leaders.
 Shensi Province, which had
 announced a take-over of power
 on 26 January,  seems to be in
 turmoil again.   A provincial
 radiobroadcast from Shensi on
 4 February said that "revolution-
 aries" were "making slow steps
 without advancing" and claimed
 that the key to victory "lies in
 staging a people's war."   The
 radio went on to exhort "revolu-
 tionaries" to fight this war in
 the streets,  factories,  and rural
 areas.
 Page 8
 The tone of seizure announc
 ments indicates that pro-Mao
 forces are firmly in control of
 the party apparatus in the East
 China provinces of Kiangsi, Anhwei
 and Shantung.   Peking's failure
 to endorse these take-overs may
 be related to problems involving
 the loyalty of local military
 commanders.
 Economic Aspects
 Peking has taken measures to
 protect and distribute supplies
 of food and other daily necessi-
 ties in hopes of alleviating the
 more immediate economic problems
 resulting from the "cultural revo-
 lution."   Maoist leaders still
 seem determined, however,  to push
 the revolution despite its dis-
 ruptive effects on production and
 labor discipline.
 In quick succession, Peking
 on 30 January ordered postponement
 of the lunar new year celebra-
 tions,   and on 3 February or-
 dered the military to take control
 of stocks of food and "other im-
 portant materials."   The celebra-
 tions were postponed so as not to
 compound existing difficulties--
 intermittent transport stoppages,
 some consumer goods shortages,
 and worker absenteeism.  The holi-
 day period is normally an occasion
 for extensive travel and above-
 normal demand for consumer goods.

 CHINESE STEP UP ANTI-SOVIET CAMPAIGN
 Peking's drive to goad Mos-
 cow into a diplomatic break,  now
 entering its third week, appears
 intended in part to bolster the
 "cultural revoluticon" by uniting
 the people against a foreign en-
 emy.   Anti-Soviet demonstrations
 are reported in major cities out-
 side the capital,  and domestic
 propaganda broadcasts have warned
 against a possible coup by pro--
 Soviet Chinese.
 The unprecedented. violence
 of the campaign and the evident.
 Chinese determination to push it
 through to a conclusion suggests,
 however,  that other,  equally im-
 portant objectives are involved.
 A complete break in diplomatic
 ties would enormously complicate
 Soviet problems in dealing with
 the Vietnamese war,  and could
 confront Moscow with difficult
 decisions regarding support for
 Hanoi.
 If the Chinese succeed in
 forcing Moscow to take the first
 step in breaking relations,  Peking
 would blame the Soviets for any
 tie-up in overland aid shipments
 to Vietnam.   The only feasible
 alternative to rail transport of
 major military materiel through
 China would be shipments by sea.
 The Chinese have repeatedly
 charged that Moscow was reluctant
 to take this step through fear
 of a confrontation with the US
 and the Chinese probably believe
 that in a pinch the Soviets would
 refuse to ship by sea and thus
 discredit themselves in Hanoi.
 Izvestia on 9 February ac-
 cused China of doing all. it could
 to break transport links between
 the Soviet Union and North Viet-
 nam.   This was the first time an
 official Soviet organ had leveled
 this charge.   The paper also
 quoted speculation in the Western
 press that Peking is seeking a
 break in relations with Moscow
 in order to isolate the North
 Vietnamese and stop Soviet deliv-
 eries.   This may be the first
 step in an effort to shift the
 onus for any future difficulties
 onto Peking.
 The Chinese are apparently
 stepping up the pressure on the
 Soviets in Peking.   The embassy
 is under a virtual siege and the
 Chinese have been taking steps
 to render the situation intoler-
 able.   Soviet officials have been
 warned to stay inside their com-
 pound in order to escape "serious
 incidents."   East European diplo-
 mats, who have been taking in
 food and other necessities to
 the beleaguered Russians, have
 been informed that their safety
 cannot be guaranteed if they per-
 sist.

 Nonstop demonstrations out-
 side the embassy have made de-
 liveries of fuel impossible and,
 according to the Reuters corre-
 spondent,  Soviet diplomats have
 said that coal supplies will last
 only until the end of the month.
 The Chinese could make the sit-
 uation untenable even sooner by
 cutting off water and electricity.
 Despite their difficult
 situation,  the Soviets apparently
 hope to ride out the current
 crisis.   Reuters reports from
 Peking that the Russians have

 have filled the embassy swimming

 go on doing all it could to pre-
 vent any "break up in diplomatic
 relations."   He added that "it
 all depends on the other side."

 preparing against the possibility
 that the Chinese will take some
 drastic additional action to

 ANTI-SUKARNO CAMPAIGN IN INDONESIA GAINS MOMENTUM
 Pressures against Indonesia's
 President Sukarno continue to
 mount.   Most Indonesians no longer
 debate whether or when he should
 be removed but how to accomplish
 it and what subsequently should
 be done with him.
 For the time being,  the prin-
 cipal emphasis is on persuading
 Sukarno to resign.   In addition.
 to Foreign Minister Adam Malik,
 several high-ranking army officers
 and some leaders of the National
 Party--until recently a Sukarno
 bulwark--have asked the President
 to leave the country in order to
 avoid the necessity of taking
 legal action against him.
 Student leaders argue that
 it is too late to let Sukarno
 retire quietly and that he must
 be forced to face congressional
 action and a court trial.   The
 Provisional People's Consultative
 Assembly (MPRS), the country's
 foremost policy-making body which
 would be required to take any ac-
 tion against Sukarno, reportedly
 is scheduled to convene on 6 March.
 Anti-Sukarno, pro-army ranks in
 the MPRS have been considerably
 strengthened by the addition to
 the Indonesian Parliament of 108
 new appointees, including at
 least 20 student and youth leaders.
 Parliament, now with 350 members,
 sits as a body in the MPRS, whose
 total membership now is 649.
 While the regime is placing
 chief emphasis on the Sukarno
 problem, it is also making prog-
 ress in restoring Indonesia's
 economy and international stand-
 ing.   The recently passed for-
 eign investment act which con-
 siderably improves the climate
 for foreign business activity
 has now become law.   Indonesia
 has also negotiated an invest-
 ment guarantee agreement with
 the United States.   Stabiliza-
 tion measures initiated in late
 1966, have helped slow the
 country's economic deterioration.
 Indonesia's Western credi-
 tors are scheduled to meet in

 of about two thirds of Indonesia's
 total debt to Western nations.

 FACTIONAL MANEUVERING IN LAOS
 Prime Minister Souvanna
 Phouma's rightist deputy, Leuam
 Insiesingmay,  is exerting pres-
 sure in an effort to bolster his
 much eroded position within the
 Laotian Government.   Souvanna
 nevertheless is well set to gain
 cooperation from the new National
 Assembly which opened last week.
 Leuam's failure to secure
 the election of more than a half
 dozen or so of his followers in
 the voting for the new assembly
 on 1 January substantially re-
 duced his influence.   In the pre-
 vious assembly his rightist fac-
 tion held 32 out of the 59 seats.
 In the pre-election maneuvering
 Leuam was unable to persuade key
 regional military commanders to
 support candidates amenable to
 his leadership.   Since the elec-
 tion, he has threatened to resign
 from the formal leadership of
 the rightist faction--a position
 of some importance to the nominal
 balancing of the assembly among
 leftist,  rightist,  and neutralist
 elements--unless Souvanna gives
 him a greater say in government
 decisions.
 So far,  Souvanna has been
 unmoved.   He has advised Leuam
 that if he resigns from the as-
 sembly position, he must also
 vacate the deputy prime minister-
 ship,                        a considerably more substan-
 tial office to which Leuam is
 clinging.   Souvanna's assembly
 position is strong enough that
 he need not accommodate Leuam. A
 majority of the deputies have
 pledged support to the prime
 minister,  and the president of
 the assembly has agreed to shep-
 herd his programs through.
 A much more difficult prob-
 lem for Souvanna is the question
 of integrating the neutralist
 military into the Royal Armed
 Forces.   Discussions have found-
 ered on the question of revealing
 the neutralists' true force lev-
 els.   They have been receiving
 funds and supplies on the basis
 of inflated strength figures
 which enable officers to pocket
 the proceeds of unused allotments.
 Certain commanders,  notably Col.
 Somphet,  are jockeying for the
 favor of the general staff in
 Vientiane by revealing the sizes
 of their fellow officers' units
 and proclaiming themselves sup-
 porters of full integration.
 On the military front, the
 Communists have again shown their
 ability to strike at will at ma-
 jor government installations in
 many areas by attacking Luang
 Prabang Airfield on 2 February
 and destroying a number of tac-
 tical aircraft.   The raid was
 probably a reaction to the ef-
 fective government use of Luang
 Prabang - based aircraft against
 Communist ground operations.

 Soviet leaders continue their active diplomacy

 Podgorny had done last week in Italy, the ideas of
 detente, European security,  and trade.   Brezhnev,
 meanwhile, went to Prague, where, among other things,
 he must have been trying to deal with problems cre-
 ated by West Germany's diplomatic maneuvers in East-
 ern Europe.
 The Rumanians refuse to be called to account

 Pact foreign ministers, at first set for last Monday
 in East Berlin,  if the meeting were held there and
 if the subject of their relations with West Germany
 were raised.   The meeting was thereupon reset for
 later in the week in Warsaw, and it now seems likely
 to bring forth only the most general statement of
 support for East Germany.
 In Western Europe, attention remains focused
 on the crucial Kennedy Round trade negotiations and
 on discussions over the draft nonproliferation treaty.
 West German Foreign Minister Brandt, meanwhile, vis-

 UK AND MALTA AT IMPASSE OVER PLANNED BRITISH TROOP CUTBACK
 Britain's plan to reduce
 its forces on Malta has embit-
 tered the Maltese, but London
 now has proposed new talks on
 the issue which offer some hope
 of ending the impasse between
 the two governments.
 Malta's principal concern
 is the effect the British troop
 cutback would have on its econ-

 concessions three weeks ago but
 its final offer failed to satisfy

 the UK and subsequently rejected
 another British offer.   It in-
 sisted that the British either
 reverse the decision to reduce
 their forces there--numbering
 about 4,300--or get out entirely.
 To harass the British,  the
 Maltese have withheld tax-free
 fuel and other supplies and re-
 fused services for UK units.   They
 also introduced legislation to
 remove privileges and immunities
 granted British military personnel.

 Now, however, the Maltese
 Government has indicated an in-
 terest in Britain's latest offer
 to discuss the economic effects
 of the troop reduction.   London
 also expressed its willingness
 to talk about rephasing the with-
 drawals.
 Maltese Prime Minister Borg
 Olivier has been under pressure
 from the left-leaning opposition
 leader, Dom Mintoff,  and from
 labor unions--whose members would
 suffer the most from an economic
 pinch.   Mintoff argues that Malta
 has always been undercompensated
 for the Western presence.   He
 has made vague claims that he can
 get economic assistance from Com-
 munist and neutralist countries.
 The US ambassador to Malta
 believes that further harass-

 ment of British forces might lead
 to a break in relations and a
 chaotic internal situation.   A
 breakdown of order or a rapid de-
 terioration of the economy could
 lead to the downfall of Borg
 Olivier's pro-Western government
 and the return of Mintoff's Labor
 Party to power.
 If the two sides do not re-
 solve the dispute in further talks
 an effort will probably be made
 to have NATO play a conciliatory
 role.   It would be asked to ex-
 pand its proposed study of the im-
 plications for Malta of the re-

 PACE OF KENNEDY ROUND TRADE TALKS STEPPING UP
 Participants in the Kennedy
 Round of trade and tariff nego-
 tiations are under the pressure
 of time to show results within
 the next two months.  The authority
 granted under the US Trade Ex-
 pansion Act of 1962 to cut tariffs
 by as much as 50 percent expires
 on 30 June,  and negotiated con-
 cessions must be in shape for
 formal approval by then.
 sible EEC, and particularly French,
 efforts to revive debate on how
 to handle the mutual reduction of
 particular tariffs which are mark-
 edly higher in the US than in
 Europe;  the US protectionist
 valuating system for certain chem-
 icals;  and various  "nontariff
 barriers" to trade--the most re-
 cent complaint being the new US
 auto safety standards.
 The principal negotiators
 --the US, UK, EEC, and Japan, plus
 the Scandinavians, Switzerland,
 and Canada--agreed in Geneva last
 week to press for agreement on
 the key issues by the beginning
 of April.   To meet this deadline,
 negotiations within separate com-
 mittees dealing with specific
 products such as chemicals,  steel,
 grains,  and cotton textiles will
 have to be sharply intensified.
 Ultimately, each delegation must
 be able to recommend to its re-
 spective government a "package"
 of concessions balanced among all
 these sectors.
 With the crunch thus ap-
 proaching, the "war of nerves"
 which has been part of the Geneva
 talks since their inception has
 also intensified, and the Euro-
 pean press has been carrying
 gloomy reports about the final
 outcome.   These have tended to
 concentrate on what are in fact
 likely to be major problems: pos-
 The EEC--still working out
 its internal policies and having
 to reconcile the interests of
 its six members--remains the main
 source of uncertainty.   Although
 the community will doubtless be
 tough to the end,  there have been
 several favorable developments.
 The EEC's Commission is negotiat-
 ing more freely than before,                                                                       and
 West Germany, with a recession on
 its hands,  seems even more eager
 to bring about sizable tariff
 cuts.   Also, the French have
 agreed to push for a community
 commitment to provide food to
 less developed countries as part
 of a global grain agreement.  Such
 a commitment is of great impor-
 tance to the US, but the Dutch
 and Germans,  in particular, will
 for financial reasons have con-
 siderable difficulty accepting
 it.
 Thus far, Britain's  "prob-
 ings" for EEC membership appear
 to have had no impact on the

 tariff talks.   There has, however,
 been some questioning in the
 French press whether the EEC
 should make concessions now to
 the UK and EFTA countries,  since
 their eventual membership in the
 E3C would make such concessions
 superfluous.
 The problems the developing
 countries have getting benefits
 from the Kennedy Round were re--
 cently highlighted at a high-level
 GATT  (General Agreement on Tariffs
 and Trade)  meeting in Argentina.
 Some of these countries stand to
 suffer reductions in the pref-
 erences they presently enjoy in
 developed-country markets as a
 result of the Geneva negotia-
 tions.   Differences among the
 industrialized nations on how to  25X1
 "compensate" them for such losses
 may create another difficult
 Kennedy Round hurdle.

 MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA
 Official royal African visits to the US domi-
 nate the scene this week, with the arrival of King
 Hassan of Morocco on 9 February to press for more
 defensive arms aid to counter the Soviet arms build-
 up in Algeria.   Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia,
 scheduled to arrive on 13 February, also wants ex-
 tensive arms aid and may go to Moscow for them if
 he does not get the huge package he wants from the
 US.   (An article on page 15 discusses the numerous
 problems that underlie his search for arms.)
 On the continent,  the picture in the Congo
 brightened a bit when Mobutu indicated willingness
 to discuss the formation of an international "asso-
 ciation" to mine and market the copper.   In Nigeria,
 however,  the prospects for another meeting of the
 antagonists are dim,  although a meeting of the Su-
 preme Military Council has been called for later
 this month.  Algeria held communal elections on 5
 February and the regime's success in holding them
 at all may bode well for future elections on a
 state and national level.
 The closing days of the Indian general elec-
 tion campaign have been marked by violence and much
 heckling of the Congress Party campaigners--even
 Mrs. Gandhi was struck by a thrown rock.
 The Greek Crown Council on Cyprus met this
 week with Cypriot President Makarios in attendance,
 and Prime Minister Paraskevopoulos announced his
 intention to continue the dialogue on this thorny
 problem with Turkey on the ministerial level.
 Israel says it continues to find terrorist
 bombs near its borders.  Another Israeli-Syrian
 meeting on the dispute over farming in the demili-
 tarized zone has been postponed for a week.   Saudi
 Arabia is still sounding out Yemeni anti-Egyptian
 sentiment to see what if anything can be done about
 the Egyptian presence in Yemen.

 INDIAN ELECTION CAMPAIGN INTENSIFIES
 Electoral prospects for
 India's long-ruling Congress Party
 have not materially changed as
 the campaign for the 15-21 Febru-
 ary general election enters its
 final week.   The campaign itself,
 however, has grown more heated
 and incidents of violence report-
 edly have increased.
 leaders, including Prime Minister
 Gandhi, have been heckled and
 even physically assaulted while
 campaigning in opposition strong-
 holds.   Rocks, tomatoes,  and
 shoes have been thrown at Congress
 candidates, especially by vola-
 tile conservative elements in the
 cities.
 Congress seems certain to
 retain a viable, but reduced,
 working majority in the national
 parliament.   The biggest gains at
 Congress' expense are likely to
 be scored by the right-wing oppo-
 sition parties--the Hindu nation-
 alist Jan Sangh and the conserva-
 tive Swatantra.   The  Indian Com-
 munists, split since 1964 into
 two rival parties, are not ex-
 pected to improve much, if at all,
 on the 29 seats won by the united
 party in 1962.   On the state level,
 opposition parties will almost
 certainly capture one of the 17
 state governments--Kerala--and
 have varying prospects of depriv-
 ing Congress of its majority in
 the legislatures of at least five
 other states.
 The major opposition parties,
 eager to destroy the image of
 Congress invincibility, are
 strongly on the offensive. They
 have kept alive the prevailing
 mood of discontent and dissent
 by assailing the incumbent Con-
 gress governments from virtually
 every angle.   Congress Party
 The extent of pre-electoral
 violence has given Indian authori-
 ties cause for concern, with the
 chief election commissioner warn-
 ing that such violence threatens
 to alter the climate of freedom
 for the elections.   Mrs. Gandhi,
 herself the victim of a well-aimed
 rock, has appealed to the country
 to maintain its good record for
 orderly electioneering.
 Although several national
 issues have emerged--inflation,
 food shortage, currency devalua-
 tion,  and the demand for a nation-
 wide ban on cow slaughter--none
 of these is expected to have a
 decisive effect on the election
 results.   Indian voters, espe-
 cially in the rural areas where
 most of them live,  still tend to
 vote on the basis of personality,
 caste, and strictly local issues.
 It is in these areas that Con-
 gress, with the only nationwide     25X1
 political machine, has what should
 be a decisive advantage over its
 splintered opposition.

 REVIVING OPPOSITION IN PAKISTAN
 Pakistani President Ayub Khan
 faces mounting political problems.
 Although they present no immediate
 threat to his regime, he must han-
 dle them deftly lest they be ex-
 ploited by his reviving opposition.
 After seven-year retirement
 imposed by Ayub's military regime
 in 1960,  some of the most promi-
 nent civilian politicians of the
 1950s are returning to political
 activity and this is changing the
 cast of personalities with whom
 Ayub must cope.   Some of these so-
 called EBDOnians--a term derived
 from the initials of the enabling
 order which automatically expired
 on 31 December 1966--are joining
 his Pakistan Muslim League,  and
 to this Ayub will have to adjust.
 The more active ones, however,  are
 returning to the opposition.
 Mumtaz Daultana--a former pro-
 vincial chief minister and possibly
 the most important of the EBDO-
 nians--appears to be having some
 success in uniting the center and
 rightist opposition in West Paki-
 stan.   He may hope to unite all
 anti-Ayub factions on the basis of
 their opposition to the current in-
 direct electoral system--one of the
 few issues on which they agree.
 However,  Daultana has not yet been
 able to reach an agreement with
 the extreme leftist National Awami
 Party, nor has he yet devised a po-
 sition on provincial autonomy ac-
 ceptable both to West Pakistanis
 and to the Awami League, which ad-
 vocates near independence for East
 Pakistan.   If Daultana succeeds in
 uniting antiregime elements, Ayub
 could face his greatest political
 challenge in several years.
 Among Ayub's more immediate
 problems which are subject to op-
 position exploitation has been the
 high price of food.   This has been
 an important cause of two major
 strikes--one of port workers in
 Karachi, the other a rail strike
 which temporarily paralyzed trans-
 portation in West Pakistan.   Al-
 though the government moved quickly
 to force union leaders to agree to
 a settlement,  recognized labor
 leaders lost control of union mem-
 bers to leftist agitators who may
 have been under Communist direc-
 tion.   The government found it nec-
 cessary to make large-scale arrests,
 to fire on strikers, and to use
 troops to run the trains before the
 strikers began returning to work.
 Another, more transitory
 problem has been a dispute between
 ultraconservative religious lead-
 ers and an Ayub-appointed committee
 as to the exact day on which this
 year's Ramadan fast ended.   Ayub
 retaliated by "detaining" five of
 the Muslim leaders, and the arrests
 appear to have increased popular
 dissatisfaction.
 The continued arrival of for-
 eign aid grain is improving the
 food situation, and resentment
 over the Ramadan confusion will
 disappear fairly soon.   However,
 other problems are bound to arise,
 any of which would help a revivi-
 fied opposition to whittle away at
 Ayub's still great political
 strength.

 EMPEROR OF ETHIOPIA TO VISIT UNITED STATES
 Emperor Haile Selassie ar-
 rives in Washington on 13 February
 for long-sought talks with Presi-
 dent Johnson.              He is deeply con-
 cerned with developments in the
 Horn of Africa and the Red Sea
 basin which he apparently sees
 as a Somali-Arab-Communist con-
 spiracy and a threat to the
 Ethiopian empire.
 The Emperor's foremost con-
 cern remains his archenemy,  the
 Somali Republic, which has designs
 on the Somali-inhabited terri-
 tories of Ethiopia and is support-
 ing guerrilla activities there.
 He is worried not only about that
 country's Soviet-supplied mili-
 tary buildup but also about its
 designs on French Somaliland,
 which is to decide in a 19 March
 referendum whether or not to
 with France.
 Another concern is the Egyp-
 tian and Communist presence in
 Yemen and the threat this poses
 to near-by Aden when the British
 depart next year.   Traditionally
 wary of Muslim encirclement, the
 Emperor's fears have been height-
 ened by stepped-up Arab,                                                                           Somali,

 TALKS BEGIN BETWEEN UNION MINIERE AND CONGOLESE
 Congolese President Mobutu
 and Union Miniere have both shown
 somewhat greater willingness to
 resolve their dispute, but many
 important issues remain to be
 ironed out.
 Union Miniere,  reportedly
 under considerable pressure from
 the Belgian Government and from
 other Belgian firms with inter-
 ests in the Congo, gave its
 blessing late last week to a
 proposal for a new international
 "association" to mine and market
 the Congo's copper under contract.
 Membership in the "association"
 apparently would be offered to
 several international mining
 firms, but Union Miniere, even
 though nominally excluded from
 participation, would probably
 continue to dominate the group
 through its control of European
 mining personnel in the Congo.
 A representative of a firm as-
 sociated with Union Miniere pre-
 sented the proposal to Mobutu
 during a meeting on 6 February.

 Mobutu had earlier turned
 down terms very similar to this
 proposal and had refused to con-
 sider a place in mining and mar-
 keting for either Union Miniere
 or its associates.   Nonetheless,
 at. the 6  February meeting
 he indicated a willingness to
 use the new proposal as a basis
 for negotiations.
 Although the two sides are
 in. direct communication for the
 first time since early December,
 there probably will be many ups
 and downs in their talks.   There
 are indications,  for example
 that they take divergent views
 of the "association's" purpose.
 Mobutu sees the association as
 a stopgap until he can work out
 alternative arrangements, whereas
 the Union Miniere group says
 it will cooperate only if the
 Congolese agree to a long-term
 contract.
 ALGERIA HOLDS COMMUNAL ELECTIONS
 The successful holding of
 Algerian communal elections on
 5 February--the first balloting
 for local officials since inde-
 pendence five years ago--is the
 Boumediene regime's first achieve-
 ment toward putting the country's
 administration on a firm founda-
 tion.   The regime may now consider
 it possible to hold elections for
 departmental councils and ulti-
 mately for a national assembly.
 The elections were conducted
 in an atmosphere of apparent calm.
 Despite the poor weather,  the
 turnout reached as high as 90
 percent in some rural areas and
 55 percent in Algiers.   The regime
 had made an intensive effort over
 the last three -months to arouse
 interest in the elections,  to
 ex?plain their purpose,  and to
 introduce candidates.    The higher
 participation in rural areas was
 due to efforts of local gendarmes
 apparently ordered to make sure
 the people voted.   Also,  candi-
 dates were better known person-
 ally.
 The country's sole politi-
 cal party, the National Libera-
 tion Front, was assigned the
 task of preparing the electoral
 lists, basing selection of can-
 didates on demonstrated ability
 as well as on party militancy.
 Some choice, however, was pro-
 vided by listing two nominees
 for each seat.
 These elections are the
 final step in the broad program
 of communal reform, embodied in
 a Communal Charter adopted by
 the Revolutionary Council early
 in January.   The regime's aims
 are twofold:   to stimulate and
 encourage participation in gov-
 ernmental affairs at the Grass-
 roots level, and to shift the
 central government's massive
 administrative and financial
 burdens to the local level.

 WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 Much of the political activity in the hemi-
 sphere last week was related to the forthcoming
 inter-American meetings in Buenos Aires.
 The chief task of one of those assemblies--
 the 11th Meeting of Foreign Ministers--will be to
 choose a date, site, and agenda for the proposed
 inter-American summit conference.   Most countries
 are now reconciled to having the meeting in mid-
 April at Punta del Este, Uruguay, but a consensus
 on details of an agenda will be harder to find.
 Chile, Colombia, and Mexico still insist that an
 agenda be spelled out before their presidents
 commit themselves to attend.  The Colombian foreign
 minister has suggested a month's delay in the
 meeting, even if an agenda agreement is reached.
 Attendance of several other presidents remains
 uncertain. Haiti's Duvalier may stay home for fear
 of not being allowed to return should he leave.
 Barrientos of Bolivia needs some face-saving agree-
 ment on his demand that Bolivia's aspirations for
 an outlet to the Pacific be discussed.
 One of the matters that was slated for discus-
 sion at the second of the Buenos Aires meetings--
 the Third Special Inter-American Conference,  con-
 voked to revise the OAS Charter--has been dropped.
 Brazil's proposal to "institutionalize" the Inter-
 American Defense Board--an independent body with
 only advisory powers--by making it a formal OAS
 mechanism ran into such determined opposition from
 Mexico and Chile that Brazil backed off.
 Deliberations of the hemisphere's diplomats
 in Buenos Aires next week could be interrupted by
 demonstrations or attempted disturbances.

 tons in 1967.   Havana is unlikely
 to meet this target, but the good
 current crop may permit delivery
 to the USSR of at least 3 million
 tons---last year's export target.
 Sugar deliveries probably are to
 account for most  of  the 23-percent
 growth in trade which the new
 trade pact. establishes as a goal
 for 1967.
 The  USSR remains Cuba's
 chief source of foreign support
 and accounts for half its $1.5-
 billion foreign trade.   China has
 cut back its trade with Cuba,  and
 other Communist countries assist
 Cuba reluctantly.   The Polish
 trade agreement this year,  for
 instance,  specifies only that
 trade will "equal"  that for 1966.
 Cuban-Soviet differences over
 the aims of the aid program were
 probably a factor in protracting
 the negotiations, which began
 last October.   For several years
 the USSR has provided large quan-
 tities of specially designed
 equipment and hundreds of tech-
 nicians to improve Cuban agricul-
 ture, but Havana. continues to
 seek more aid for industrial
 projects.
 Any problems encountered dur-
 ing the trade talks had no ef-
 fect on Soviet military deliver-
 ies.   These have been increased
 in recent months in an effort to
 refurbish the Cuban armed forces,
 and replace worn out or destroyed
 e ui ment.
 Recent ar-
 rivals include eight new naval
 ships--patrol craft and subchas-

 DOMINICAN PRESIDENT MOVES TO SHORE UP POLITICAL POSITION
 Dominican President Balaguer
 has been trying to shore up his
 political position and has demon-
 strated particular concern over
 the solidarity of his military
 and police support.   He intends
 to restore the pay of military
 and police officers to the level
 prevailing before the government
 adopted austerity policies last
 summer.
 Balaguer's authorization of
 a roundup of left-wing dissidents
 on 22 January was partially in-
 tended to show the military that
 he could move firmly to curb anti-
 government activities.   Similarly,
 his speech on 4 February portray-
 ing plotting and subversion by
 the Communists may have been in-
 tended in part to reassure hard-
 line military elements that he
 is not blind to this danger.
 Relations with opposition
 elements acceptable to Balaguer
 are also coming in for presiden-
 tial attention.   In an attempt to
 isolate and weaken the militant
 leadership of the left-of-center
 Dominican Revolutionary Party
 (PRD), Balaguer has named PRD
 dissident Angel Miolan to be
 Minister without portfolio.   He
 has also taken a relatively mod-
 erate and flexible stand in deal-
 ings with the left-of-center Rev-
 olutionary Social Christian Party,
 which has indicated its inten-
 tions to keep its opposition ac-
 tivities within bounds acceptable
 to Balaguer.
 Balaguer has taken some steps
 to allay concern among moderates
 over the sometimes arbitrary ac-
 tions of the government.   He has
 publicly apologized to non-Commu-
 nist dissidents who were caught
 in the roundup of left-wingers
 last month and now seems willing
 to accept some of the secondary-
 student demands that have led to a
 protracted school boycott.
 Through his statements and
 actions Balaguer appears to be
 consciously attempting to create
 an impression that he is in
 full control of political develop-
 ments and is not threatened by
 any serious unrest.   His assidu-
 ous cultivation of potential po-
 litical allies seems to indicate  25X1
 apprehension that challenges to
 his government may be developing

 BRAZIL PROMOTING TRADE WITH EASTERN EUROPE AND USSR
 The Brazilian trade mission
 that has been touring Eastern Eu-
 rope for several weeks has con-
 cluded its talks there and moved
 on to Western Europe and the US.
 The mission, headed by Minister
 of Industry and Commerce Martins,
 is part of a major Brazilian ef-
 fort to expand foreign trade.
 Brazil has been sending about
 six percent of its total exports
 to the USSR and Eastern Europe
 in recent years,  but the volume
 has been limited by Brazil's
 restricted capacity to import
 bloc products.   Exports averaged
 about $100 million annually dur-
 ing 1964 and 1965,  and rose to
 nearly $70 million in the first
 half of 1966.
 In Moscow the Brazilians  con-
 cluded the first deal under last
 year's $100-million credit agree-
 ment with the Soviets.   A $5-mil-
 lion credit was extended to fi-
 nance the construction of a petro-
 chemical plant in the state of
 Bahia.

 Hard bargaining is likely
 t:o be the order of the day when
 foreign ministers of the Western
 Hemisphere meet in Buenos Aires
 on 15 February.   Differences of
 opinion are already apparent on
 every item to be discussed at
 these meetings,  the Third Spe--
 c_ial Inter-American Conference
 and the 11th Meeting of Foreign
 Ministers.
 One major purpose of the
 meeting is to make final deci-,
 sions on amendments to the Charter
 of the Organization of American
 States  (OAS).   These amendments
 were drafted by a special OAS
 committee in Panama almost a
 year ago, but the follow-up meet-
 ing scheduled for August was
 postponed because of the mili-
 tary coup in Argentina. The most
 controversial of these amendments
 is one spelling out US undertak-
 ings on economic aid, which the
 ES opposes and other members are
 eager to adopt.
 Differences of opinion are
 also likely over regional eco-
 nomic integration.   According
 to a press report, the Chilean
 foreign minister, who is one of
 the strongest advocates of in-
 tegration, may not attend be-
 cause of political problems at
 home.   The US ambassador in San-
 tiago, however, believes that
 Valdes will go.   If he stays
 away,  strong leadership for any
 meaningful decisions on economic
 cooperation may be lacking.
 Planning for the inter-
 American summit meeting may also
 pose problems.   Although most
 members agree that the meeting
 should be held at Punta del Fste,
 Uruguay, from 12 to 14 April,
 some countries find these dates
 inconvenient because of govern-
 ment changes and congressional
 sessions.   Furthermore,  there
 is some feeling that it is pre-
