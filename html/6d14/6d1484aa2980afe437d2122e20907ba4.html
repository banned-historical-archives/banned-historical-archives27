 The criticism of Stalin made at the 20th Party Congress resulted in an im-

 leaders. issued a statement on the relations between socialist states

 article entitled "More on the Historical Experience of the. Proletarian Dictator-

 the solidarity of proletarian internationalism centering around the USSR and
 explained that the international solidarity among the Communist parties of
 countries of the world is the new form of union in the history of mankind.
 .The Communist parties of the various countries must unite, and at the 'same
 time the countries must become independent states; they must recognize the
 fact that they are the representatives of the just racial interests and
 .racial sentiments of their own'people.  Therefore, in order to strengthen the
 international unity of the socialist countries, "the Communist parties of the,
 socialist states must mutually respect the racial interests and racial senti-
 ments of other countries.   However,. the USSR under  Stalin "showed a tendency
 to assume the attitude of a great power in its relations with its allies and

 it is not appropriate to assume that. this criticism against
 formalism and the assertion that it should be overcome had the effect of
 destroying Sino-Soviet solidarity or that it would imperil the unity of the
 socialist camp.
 It must be noted that Communist China's plea was made to
 strengthen the union between 'the USSR and Communist China. and to reinforce
 the: solidarity of the socialist camp.  This purpose is attested to by the
 fact that the Chinese not only charged that they, themselves must overcome
 Formalism but also 'at the same time, harshly criticized revisionism.
 The suppression of formalism was naturally accompanied by a struggle
 'against the revisionists because (although the many forms and methods of
 socialist construction and its independent nature may have been acknowledged)
 the important problem was to determine to what degree such diversion and in-
 Idependents nature could be permitted, since there was the need to criticize
 all those who went too far and who as 'a result became guilty of revisionism.

 Except for their mutual hatred of American imperialism, the Soviet and
 Chinese leaders differed in their attitudes toward imperialism, war, and
 peace -  at least, their points of view must be regarded as having different
 nuances The Soviet stand on these issues is clarified in Khrushchev's report

 Under these conditions, Lenin's. proposition that
 fox war exists and is effective as long as imperialism exists" stands true
 today, but since factors other than economic have changed, "war is not athing
 that cannot be prevented by any means.". In other words, according to Khrushchev,
 Lenin's theory that war is inevitable as long as capitalism exists must be re-
 stated to read that "even.though capitalism exists, war is not inevitable." It
 goes without saying that this theory of imperialism and war provides the theo
 reticel background of his'policy of peaceful coexistence.  The Soviet argument
 is that in a time like the present when two social systems exist with one
 following a course toward "the most destructive war" (with the use of atomic
 weapogs) and the other adopting a course of "peaceful coexistence," and when
 inevitable even, though capitalism exists, there can be no other
 course to follow but the course of peaceful coexistence.   Therefore, the. Soviet
 d vernment,could not ignore Communist China's recent interpretation of im- ,
 perialism, war, and peace.  The Soviet position was expounded in MatokovskiVB
