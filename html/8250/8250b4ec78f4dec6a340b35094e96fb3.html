 Editorial Page
 It is probable that Soviet actions in resuming nuclear testing and
 refusing to continue negotiating on a nuclear test-ban at this time result
 from the failure of Khrushchev's German policy to catapult the West into
 concessions, and thereby upset his timetable.  The nuclear tests and
 disarmament problems, however, should not be tied solely to the German
 situation.  Whatever the end of the German problem, the threat and fear
 tactics in the Soviet armament strategy will continue to be used in
 attempts to weaken the will of the free world to resist continuing Soviet
 demands.

 Briefly Noted
 Definition of Cuban "Socialism" - The Cuban police in Havana has
 banned the publication of Voz Proletaria, the press organ of the local
 Trotskyite section.     In addition, it has destroyed the plates of Trotsky's
 book, the Revolution Betrayed, which was in process of publication.  It is to
 be noted that this took place while the Cuban government was playing host
 to Vittorio Vidali (Communist member of the Italian Chamber of Deputies)
 and the Spanish Communist leader Lister, both of whom organized and
 sirected the massacre of anarchists and Trotskyists during the Spanish Civil
 Wat.  In spite of Castro's assertions that Cuba is not a Communist but a
 Socialist State, it would appear that his favorite form of "Socialism" is one
 which receives its directives directly from Moscow.
 "Horror Bomb" - Attention is directed to an article from the Washington
 Post of 10 September, "'Horror Bomb' Is Cut To Size by Cube Root, " by
 Zygmunt Litynski.  (See Press Comment, 12 September 1961). This article
 (or other articles based on it) is highly recommended where it is desirable to
 allay exaggerated fears of the military importance of Khrushchev's 100 megaton
 bomb.  As shown in Guidance #428, Khrushchev is seeking to mobilize world
 opinion; this article could be a useful weapon in thwarting his intention.  The
 fact that, as the article points out, the 100 megaton bomb is militarily pointless
 does not, of course, negate the fact that it will create a sizable amount of
 fallout. Along the same line, to show that the Soviet Union does not enjoy
 military superiority, we recall to your attention Guidance #365 of 27 March
 1961, "The Nuclear Submarine -- An American Technical Triumph".  (Note
 that, as a later correction indicated, the Minuteman missile will not after
 all be mounted on railroad cars, but on "hardened" underground pads. )

 Background:  Following the Moscow Declaration in December 1960, an
 uneasy truce seemed to prevail in the Communist Bloc.  Within the last two
 months, however, direct friction between Moscow and Peiping has again become
 evident.  Referring to Isaac Deutscher's celebrated London Sunday Times
 account (See Press Comment, 5 July 1961), Polish officials have said that, in
 substance if not in fact, Deutscher's story reflected the Moscow-Peiping
 situation "with 90 percent accuracy. " Genuine signs of Sino-Soviet tension
 include the following:
 a.  The greatest present irritant in Moscow-Peiping relations is
 probably Albania.  At the Bucharest Congress in June 1960, Albania took
 a strongly pro-Chinese position, and at the 81.Party Conference in Moscow
 in November 1960, she pursued (as Walter Ulbricht disclosed) a "dogmatic
 and sectarian" attitude; in fact, Hoxha and Khrushchev exchanged insults.
 Albanian "left-wing" positions have been restated since the Moscow
 Conference at national congresses in February and May 1961.  Peiping
 has granted Albania a new $125, 000, 000 credit, and in a communique of
 25 April, made it plain that the aid is a reward for supporting Peiping' S'
 position.  At the end of May, an Albanian court condemned to death four
 defendants, ostensibly agents of the "Yugoslavs, Greeks, and U. S. Sixth
 Fleet," a verdict actually aimed at Khrushchev's unsuccessful attempts
 to overthrow the Hoxha regime.  Moscow maintained a propaganda silenc~c
 and withdrew its military personnel and submarines.  (See Guidances #304,
 #390, and #401.)
 b.  There are indications that the USSR is endeavoring to make its
 relaticn s with Yugoslavia closer and warner.  For example, the Yugos4av
 Foreign Minister, Koca Popovic, arrived in Moscow on 7 July to see
 Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko.  This would appear to be related to
 Albanian developments, and "Yugoslav revisionism" is of course
 anathema to Peiping.  (See Guidance #284.)
 c.  On 3 July the Kremlin sent a delegation, headed by the leading
 Soviet theoretician, Mikhail A. Suslov, to the 40th anniversary celebra-
 tions of the Mongolian Republic at Ulan Bator.  (Suslov also visited India
 recently).  No delegation was sent to the 40th anniversary of the Chinese
 Communist Party at Peiping.  In speaking at Ulan Bator on 4 July,
 Suslov stressed Communist solidarity and the "peaceful co-existence"
 policy, and made no reference to China.
 d.  The Soviet Trade Ministry has made a point of disclosing in
 Vneshnaya Torgovliya (Forein Trade) that Communist China owes the
 USSR more than $300, 000, 000, due to the Chinese failures to meet
 export committments.  The Soviets have also revealed that Soviet
 exports of complex machinery to China will be reduced.  Last month,

 Moscow's Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta (Economic Gazette) published
 extensive data on Chicom production which had been withheld from
 Peiping's own official announcement.  The USSR has refused to send
 food to feed the starving Chinese, with the exception of a shipment
 of surplus Cuban sugar.
 e.  Moscow published last month in Partinaya Zhizn (Party Life)
 its own version of the 40 year history of the Chinese party.  Harry
 Schwartz of the New York Times summarized this article as follows:
 "This Soviet version /of Chicom history/ differs
 markedly from the Chinese Communists' own public line
 on this history.  In the Soviet version, Mao Tse-tung is
 only one of several Chinese Communist party leaders
 who urged correct tactics in the party's early years.
 Moreover, the article denies, in effect, that the Chinese
 Communist party had made any fundamental contributirn s
 to the knowledge of how to build socialism.  The Soviet
 magazine asserts that the Chinese experience, has funda-
 mentally shown the correctness and universality of the
 general principles of Socialist revolution and construction.
 It has shown, the article said, "that the work begun in
 October 1917 by the Russian Communists is the model for
 Communists of all countries, including also for China.  To
 emphasize this point, the Soviet article hails the collectivi-
 zation of Chinese agriculture on the Soviet model in the
 nineteen fifties as 'the great revolutionary change' in
 Chinese history.  It suggests error in the much more
 radical formation of the Chinese people's communes in
 1958.  The Communist International according to the
 Soviet publication, gave instructions in the Nineteen
 Twenties for Chinese Communist to stress revolutionary
 activity among the peasants.  This implies that Mr. Mao's
 contribution in this area was not novel.  The article also
 gives credit to Lenin rather than to Mr. Mao for the idea
 of purchasing property from capitalists,  The technique
 has been employed by the Chinese Communists to end
 private industry and trade. "
 It appears that Khrushchev has decided that he must establish his
 mastery over the bloc, once and for all.  It is striking that, since the Albanian
 developments, all the pressure in Sino-Soviet relations seems to come from
 the Soviet side.  On 5 July, Peiping radio reported that Chinese Foreign
 Minister Chen Yi had been entertained at a banquet in Moscow by Khrushchev
 and all the leading dignitaries, but Tass only reported that Gromyko received
 :hen Yi, "who had stopped over in Moscow. " On 8 July, Pravda (perhaps

 to check rumors arising from the Deutscher article) published a statement by
 Chen Xi, entitled "China for Peaceful Coexistence", denouncing "gossip" about
 Sino-Soviet relations. In publishing this statement, however, the Soviets seemed
 to be trying to commit China to complete support of Soviet positions, to imply
 a Soviet triumph; a statement by a Soviet leader recognizing the equality of
 China would have been more pertinent to the questions raised by Deutscher.
 (In any case) Chen Yi's statement, printed without dateline, had actually been
 made before he left Geneva, to a Canadian TV correspondent,)

 426.  The 22nd CPSU Congress
 8-030"W%JA 4fli   d 961
 Background: The 22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet
 Union CPSU is scheduled to begin in Moscow on 17 October. It is the first
 "regular" Congress since the 20th Congress, held in February 1956 and made
 memorable by Khrushchevts secret speech, downgrading Stalin, and by major
 deviations from Stalin's principal policies. The 21st Congress was not
 designated as a "regular" congress and did not elect a new Central Committee.
 The 22nd Congress will be attended by approximately 4, 500 delegates,
 since representation -- which used to be I delegate for 5, 000 party members --
 has been expanded to 1 delegate for 2, 000 members (the CPSU has now over
 8 1/2 million members). Most foreign Communist Parties, inside and outside
 the Bloc, will be represented by high-ranking delegations and the Congress will
 undoubtedly be used for many formal and informal contacts between Soviet and
 :.reign party officials: nothing definite is known as yet concerning a large
 formal meeting with the foreign delegates, comparable with the conference of
 81 Communist Parties last November.
 Khrushchev will be the paramount figure at the Congress: he is scheduled
 to deliver both principal speeches, the report of the Central Committee and the
 report on the new party, program. There will be, of course, the customary
 speeches by leading foreign delegates and carefully stage-managed "debates".
 Main purposes of the Congress, as much as can be estimated at this
 moment, are likely to be:
 a.  to proclaim Khrushchev as the leader of the World Communist
 Movement -- based on whatever successes in the Berlin crisis he will
 be able to maintain at that time, plus his support of "liberation wars" in
 Cuba, Laos, Vietnam, the Congo, etc. , as well as "his" successes in  _..
 space flight, etc. -- and to demonstrate unanimous support for his forth-
 coming moves to complete the "downfall of U. S. imperialism, " for his
 action against the UN, etc. ;
 b.  to present Khrushchev as the leading authority on Communist
 ideology and doctrine (thus implicitly refuting Chicom claims about Mao's
 superiority in this field), as author of the new party program. (See also
 Guidance #421, 28 August 1961: "The Draft of the CPSU Program");
 c.  To strengthen I4 rushchev's grip on the party apparat by electing a
 new Central Committee, packed with staunch supporters of Khrushchev,
 and adopting new party statutes, facilitating his continued control (e. g. by
 facilitating replacement of older, unregenerate officials, as suggested in
 the draft program).
 Khrushchev will try hard to obtain some substantive concessions from the
 West before the Congress opens: this is likely to result in a further increase of
 the tensions created by his threats regarding Berlin, by his resumption of
 nuclear tests and other recent moves. These developments may change the
 conditions under vhich the Congress will meet. Appearance of an internti
 opposition within the CPSU (whether Stalinist, pro-Chinese or reflecting
 Malenkov's "anti-party group")NNis unlikely, though the final version of the pro-
 gram or theApprro ie  oor eofease ZO6 3r/   , `rC1~ _%pf24    AW66fMgbbqJ*y reflect

 427.  The Forthcoming Sixteenth General Assembly of the United Nations
 Background: On 19 September, the Sixteenth General Assembly of the
 United Nations will be convened in New York, with ninety-nine member nations
 and possibly several more to be admitted. There are many ports of divergence
 and possible conflict facing the world and it is not possible to predict which of
 the widespread and diverse issues will either be stressed or cause outspoken--
 if not heated - debate. There can be no question that voting by "bloc" - that
 is, ly grouped national self-interest or ideological commitment  - will assume
 seriou3 importance. The non-committed national states now have a numerical
 voting majority. Those belonging to the Afro-Asian community - with few
 exceptions extending east from the Atlantic to the South Pacific - constitute
 the largest group. The adherents of communism, including the USSR, and the
 atellites have the least voting weight. The West lies in between. Since none of
 .he three groups controls a clear majority, the basic contest is the formation
 of a majority on each issue. It is an age-old problem in parliamentary
 a s semhh e s - a problem Western Europe and the United States and Canada havc-
 fully understood for many years (and a problem India and Japan are beginning
 to understand and cope with) - but which the USSR and much of the rest of the
 world do not. Most succinctly stated, it is the problem of achieving the
 significant majority of votes at the right moment in any parliamentary of
 general assembly.
 The Special Session on Bizerte, which opened in New York on 21 August,
 offers perhaps a general indication of what may happen at the 16th General
 Assembly. At that Special Session the whole-hearted support accorded Tunis
 against France by the Afro-Asian states, joined by most of the un-committed
 nations in other geographic areas, clearly indicates that on questions conce colonialism and related issues there will be a solid majority supporting an inde-
 pendent position. That the USSR will continue its assault on the US and the   c:;?t
 is highly probable. That the issue of reorganization of the UN Secretariat and of
 general support - including financial - of the UN will cause much debate and
 disclose many shades of opinion (with the USSR ever pressing for a weaker UN)
 cannot be questioned. It is uncertain whether the Berlin problem will be
 formally put before the General Assembly t?.iis session, but the issue will be
 present in the minds of everyone, and is expected to be the subject of extensive
 discussion. The pending 22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet
 Union (CPSU), convening in mid-October, will be an influential factor in the
 voting pattern of the Communist Bloc states. The resumption of nuclear testing
 will have its influence.
 One of the most difficult issues will be the admission of Communist China.
 That, however, is being treated in a separate Guidance and need not be dis-
 cussed here other than to say that our path is a thorny one.
 Against this background, the United States, supported by the West
 generally, will maintain and press a position embracing the following points:
 a.  Support of retention and extension of a strong Secretariat headed by
 a single Secretary-General, strengthening of UN administrative proce-

 from New York.
 b.  Extension of understanding and consultation between the West and
 the uncommitted nations on all UN matters; development of further
 cooperative efforts between the industrialized states of the Free World

 c.  Holding firm on t he necessity for a reasonable and sound
 approach toward all matters involving international security and the risk
 of war, including Berlin, disarmament, prohibition of nuclear fission
 testing, and the right of all nations to be free from interference or the
 threat of interference from outside their borders;

 429. SO VIE'IR        EeP6           5    FL~L ~
 Background:  The Soviet Union's statement of 31 August on the resumption
 of nuclear weapons tests stated: "The harmful effects of thermonuclear weapon
 tests on living organisms are well known in the Soviet Union, therefore every
 measure is being taken to minimize such effects" and noted that this decision
 to carry out tests was taken with "heavy heart". On 3 September the President
 of the United States and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in a joint
 proposal to Khrushchev called for an agreement between the three not to conduct
 nnac.lear tests which take place in the atmosphere and produce radioactive
 7",.1.1-out. The Una f UKK G=tatement noted that: "Their aim in this proposal is to
 protect mankind from the increasing hazards from atmospheric pollution and to
 contrib.trce to the reduction of international tensions. "
 Though there ig considerable divergence of opinion in scientific and
 ::n--dical circles over the scope of damage that, may be inflicted on mankind's
 inaalth from continued nuclear weapons testin g, world opinion particularly in
 Asia is deeply concerned with and vulnerable to the subject of hazards of
 radioactive fall.. out.
 Since testing sites used by all atomic powers to date are in relatively
 isolated areas there is little concern over the direct or short-term fall-out
 that covers the target or blast area. The real danger growing out of nuclear
 tests stems from the radioactive debris that finds its way into the earth's
 stratosphere. This long term fall-out virtually circles the globe and settles back
 to earth months or years after the explosion. The special hazards to the human
 race are to be found in those radioactive elements of the fall-out which are
 taken into the body and ly their nature have a tendency to accumulate or build
 up in deposits. The most talked about and potentially dangerous element is
 strontium 90, which like radium, is retained in the body and deposited in bone.
 Through fall-out it contaminates the soil and eventually contaminates man's food
 supply and may cause bone tumors, aplastic anemia or leukemia. An official
 Of the US Atomic Energy Commission is quoted in the 31 August New York Times
 that "the strontium 90 already created by nuclear explosions could cause 50 to
 100 cases of bone cancer a year for the next seventy years and twice that many
 cases of leukemia, cancer of the blood."
 Prior to the suspension of tests in October 1958, Soviet scientists produced
 numerous articles on the perils of radioactive fall-out. As noted in the New York
 Times of 4 September 1961 (See Press Comment, dated 6 September) Soviet
 Professor A. M. Kuzin in mid-1958 observed that if nuclear tests continued,
 7, 000, 000 lives per generation would be lost due to diseases caused by the
 radioactivity. Three years ago prominent Soviet scientist A. P. Vinogradov
 stated radioactive contamination of man's environment is "criminal". The Soviet
 magazine Mezhdunarodnaya Zhizn in October 1958 declared: "Radio active fall-out
 is a grave hazard to the health of the people living today and threatens the normal
 development of future generations." Concerning possible effects on future
 generations, some scientists feel that cesium 137, a radioactive element found
 in fall-out, will contribute to various genetic disorders and diseases. Cesium 137
 has characteristics similar to strontium 90 in that it is taken up by plant life,

 enters the human food chain and adds to the normal radioactivity of the human
 body. Unlike strontium 90, cesium 137 is absorbed by the soft tissues of the
 body rather than the bone.
 As is well known the Soviets are conducting a series of atmospheric tests
 of low to intermediate yield nuclear weapons in the Semipalatinsk area of
 Central Asia. They have declared their intent to test bombs of a strength up to
 100 million tons of TNT, a force 5, 000 times greater than the bomb exploded
 over Hiroshima. As outlined in Item #428 world reaction outside the Soviet
 bloc to the Soviet's resumption of tests has been one of alarm, shock, and
 disgust with the irresponsibility of the Soviet move.

 acKgrouncl: During Fresident Nkrumah's visit to the USSR in July, he ,
 indicated, in a number of speeches, that the USSR was a model to be emulated
 in the search for political union in Africa. In his luncheon speech of 11 July at
 the Kremlin, he declared: "Slow remarkable it is that within the short space
 of time, you have welded fifteen Republics and seventy-three nationalities into
 one strong state and achieved nearly one hundred percent literacy".
 At Tashkent on 17 July, the President repeated his themes when he said:
 "I have been struck by the fact that sixty different nationalities in this Republic
 have been able to come together and to support the great development program
 of your government. " Referring to the welding together of "nationalities" as
 demonstrating the effectiveness of political union, he went on to say: "The
 strength and unity of the nationalities of this Republic is symbolic of the
 .,strength and power of the Soviet Union itself. " Subsequently, in the same speech
 he said: "The peoples of the Soviet Union by the manner in vhich they have
 .gelded many Republics and nationalities into one great country, have demon-
 strated the effectiveness of political union, and this is most inspiring for us in
 our struggle for the political unification of the African continent. Comrade
 Chairman, this is a great lesson for Ghana and for Africa as a whole. The
 example of the Uzbek Republic and of the Soviet Union shows that our ideal of
 African unity is not a mere dream but a distinct possibility and, indeed, a
 necessity for survival and development in Africa. ""
 In a speech at Kiev on 19 July, President Nkrumah referred to the welding
 together of many republics and nationalities into one country as demonstrating
 the effectiveness of political union and added: "This is an achievement which
 we can surely emulate in Africa where the conditions for unity are so favorable
 and the necessity so imperative." He went on to suggest that existing national
 boundaries in Africa should be revised saying: "Our present territorial
 boundaries were demarcated for us in a manner calculated to assist the
 imperialists and colonialists in their plans for domination, exploitation and
 control. We, therefore, have a clear duty to rediscover the links formerly
 uniting our people and which can form the only basis for African strength and
