SCOPE NOTE 
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in March 1985 characterized the 
reforms conducted since the Third Plenum of the 11th Central 
Committee in December 1978 as a "second revolution," which "is an 
unprecedented thing in China's history of thousands of years." These 
reforms involve fundamental political, economic, and social changes, 
probably the most comprehensive and systematic ever undertaken by a 
Communist regime. This Estimate considers what the second revolution 
is, how it is affecting Chinese institutions and society, and how it is like-
ly to develop over the next 10 years. It also considers various courses 
these reforms might take and how they are likely to affect US interests.

KEY JUDGEMENTS 
China's far-reaching reform effort?unprecedented in Communist 
experience?has already achieved certain notable successes and is likely 
to continue, albeit at a somewhat reduced pace, over the next decade. 
This means that in the broader overall context China's power and 
influence will grow, a prospect that will offer both significant new long-
term opportunities and challenges for the United States. 
The principal goals of the reform movement?which in their 
totality clearly constitute a "second Chinese revolution"?are: 
? To restructure, reorient, and rejuvenate the political leader-
ship. This entails reorganizing and reforming the party; separat-
ing party and state functions; revamping ideology along more 
pragmatic lines; establishing stronger legal and institutional 
structures; and bringing younger, better educated, and more 
qualified personnel into positions of responsibility. 
? To expand the economy. This entails narrowing the scope of 
central planning and gradually allowing market forces to deter-
mine more economic activity; improving efficiency, productivi-
ty, and quality in production; raising the standard of living; 
developing more effective financial institutions; gradually elim-
inating government involvement; promoting development of a 
relatively unregulated tertiary sector; opening China's economy 
to foreign participation; and giving priority to existing industrial 
bases. 
? To fashion a leaner, more professional military establishment. 
This entails establishing a younger and more educated officer 
corps; reducing the overall size of the armed forces; constricting 
the role of the military in the economy and in politics; 
reorganizing military regions and commands; and acquiring and 
deploying improved weapons and equipment from domestic 
and foreign sources. 
? To create a society less constrained by political and social 
controls. 
? To expand ties to the outside world that will assure China 
breathing space that will enable it to concentrate on its ambi-
tious efforts to modernize and provide access to economic, 
scientific, and technical support.

In seeking these ends, there will be significant constraints that will 
fashion, slow, and under certain circumstances, possibly halt certain of 
the reform efforts for a time: 
? Deng Xiaoping and his supporters face the extremely difficult 
task of loosening certain controls?in order to stimulate the 
receptivity, creativity, and flexibility necessary to achieve the 
goals of reform?without, in the process, losing their own 
monopoly of power. This basic contradiction may prove to be 
the single most vexing problem these leaders will confront, 
inasmuch as they believe they can establish far-reaching eco-
nomic reform and yet maintain the leadership of the Party and 
the Marxist-Leninist character of the society. 
? Sharp differences exist among the leadership on some issues of 
the scope and pace of reform. While we believe that the broad 
thrust of reform will continue, the implementation of various 
policies will be highly uneven, owing to these internal 
difficulties: 
? Traditional endemic systems of guanxi (personal relationship) 
networks, favoritism for relatives, going through the "back 
door" and other traditional methods of doing business will not 
speedily be abolished, if at all. 
? Senior officials who fear that retirement will bring loss of 
power, prestige, and perks will continue to resist some ele-
ments of reform. 
? Concerns will abide, especially among lower ranking cadres, 
that the reforms will not endure. 
? There will also be concerns that the rapid opening to the West 
will allow "unhealthy influences" to enter China and will also 
make it too dependent on foreign countries. 
? A myriad of technical, financial, and managerial obstacles will 
impede the ability of China, a huge, still backward LDC, to 
meet its reform goals. Some of these problems are not wholly 
within China's own ability to control and are crucially impor-
tant infrastructure gaps in energy and transportation. 
? Finally, the effort to modernize will create disruptive economic 
and social problems such as inflation, corruption, income dispar-
ities, regional inequalities, and occasional outbursts of social 
discontent. 
How the party approaches these issues, and the particular scope, 
character, and pace of reforms over the next few years, will be 
influenced significantly by how well the succession to Deng takes place.

We now believe that the mechanisms are in place for a fairly orderly 
succession, and that the leadership that follows Deng, for the most part, 
will share the goals and priorities he has set. These successors will be 
prepared where necessary to adjust the pace of reforms, from time to 
time, when faced by marked political hesitance and economic/techni-
cal constraint. 
The maintenance of reforms will also be affected significantly by 
external forces. China's ambitious revolution will not be taking place in 
a vacuum but in a broad context of interacting outside pressures on 
China: most notably from the USSR, the United States, and Japan. In 
this setting we believe that the Chinese will continue to perceive that 
they are not imminently threatened by the Soviet Union and will have 
time to concentrate resources on economic modernization. China will, 
meanwhile, continue to value its economic ties to the West and japan 
and will continue to push strongly for infusions of foreign technology 
and investment. 
Despite the many hazards that will confront China's modernization 
effort, we believe the most likely outcome over the next decade will be 
a general continuation of reform and an uneven but gradual growth 
of China's economic strength, stability, and power. This means that, in 
broad terms: 
? The reforms will for the most part bring reasonable prosperity 
and will give most of the populace a stake in the continuation of 
reform. 
An avowedly centrally planned economy will attempt to make 
increasing use of both market forces and political intervention 
and will encourage flexibility and competition within certain 
carefully prescribed sectors. 
? The economy and the society will in many respects be opened 
up still more than at present but without the party losing its pre-
eminence and control or the society losing its distinctively 
Chinese Communist character. 
? The pace of reform will be uneven, progress will be start and 
stop, there will be incessant disputes over priorities and scope, 
and leadership shifts will occur as various members of the 
second generation attempt to strengthen their respective power 
and authority. But, we believe such developments will not lead 
to major turmoil, as occurred during the Cultural Revolution, 
and will be more or less confined to the type of political struggle 
we have witnessed over the last eight years or so.

? China will develop an extensive web of interlocking trade, 
technological, and financial relationships with other countries?
mainly Western countries and Japan?but this will include 
markedly expanded ties to the USSR. 
? China will conduct a foreign policy that is more activist, 
including competing more assertively with newly industrialized 
countries to sell to foreign markets, maintaining an aggressive 
policy of arms sales abroad, and playing one country off against 
another in order to obtain the best possible terms for foreign 
markets and investments. Beijing's foreign policies will nonethe-
less seek above all to avoid such external conflicts as might 
interfere seriously with China's primary focus on moderniza-
tion. 
Should this -most likely- projection prevail, with China's modern-
ization effort meeting modest success, the significance for the United 
States will be profound. Among the principal consequences: 
The growth of Chinese power will be gradually accompanied by 
a corresponding expansion of Chinese regional and global 
interests. China will feel more confident and capable of promot-
ing its interests in the strategic triangle and probably will 
genuinely move toward its avowed objective of an -indepen-
dent- foreign policy. 
China will continue, and perhaps escalate, its pressure on the 
United States to reduce arms sales to Taiwan, and will increas-
ingly pressure the United States to convince Taiwan to accept 
Beijing's terms for national reconciliation. 
There will be continuing opportunities for US trade and 
investment, as China will want to continue its favorable eco-
nomic and other ties to the United States and other Western 
countries. How willing Beijing will be to continue to mute some 
of its more nationalistic goals?such as recovery of Taiwan?to 
achieve these benefits, as it has in the past, is uncertain. 
There will also be some opportunities for a limited expansion of 
US military cooperation with China, primarily in the regulariza-
tion of exchanges at various levels. However, China will not 
wish to rapidly expand military hardware acquisitions from the 
United States. 
? The gradual growth of Chinese power and influence will 
complicate US relations with other countries in East Asia. Some 
countries will increasingly try to persuade the United States to 
place restraints on its assistance to Chinese military 
modernization.

? China will continue to be wary of the Soviet strategic threat and 
of Soviet intentions, but will likely be increasingly willing to 
engage in various forms of economic and other exchange with 
the USSR; China may also eventually be willing to restore party 
ties. However, these improved economic and political ties will 
not lead to Chinese cooperation with the Soviets against the 
United States, because the United States and the West will 
remain more important than the Soviets as a source of technol-
ogy, investment, and other economic advantages. 
Though less likely than the projection posited above, another 
plausible scenario is one in which the technical and political problems 
we have noted gradually overwhelm the reforms. Such an outcome 
would be one stopping short of total collapse or total failure of reform, 
but one most likely to result in a permanent recentralization of 
authority and a tightening of economic controls. A more centralized and 
repressive regime probably would not be able to resolve China's 
economic problems, and popular support would dwindle over time. 
This alternative is also likely to be accompanied by an upsurge in 
Chinese nationalism. The Chinese probably would blame the developed 
countries for their problems, but are also most likely to be suspicious 
and hostile toward the USSR. China probably would escalate rhetoric 
identifying with various Third World causes and might allow territorial 
problems with its neighbors to become more serious. We believe, 
however, that the political unrest and nationalistic excesses on the scale 
of the Cultural Revolution would be unlikely. 
If this scenario were to unfold, there would be greater challenges 
for the United States since China probably would become even more 
stubborn in asserting its regional demands. The Hong Kong settlement 
could unravel, causing the Taiwan issue to become more difficult. 
There would likely be setbacks across the board in economic, scientific 
and technical, and cultural cooperation, though we do not believe these 
would be abandoned altogether. Suspicion and hostility toward China 
by Japan and Southeast Asian countries could increase, and these 
countries would likely put greater pressure on the United States to avoid 
policies that had the appearance of strengthening China. Some Chinese 
leaders might want to further reduce tension with the Soviet Union and 
perhaps even develop closer ties to replace links to the West, but others 
would continue to resist, harboring lingering suspicions of Soviet 
intentions. 
As for other alternative futures, we believe that there is almost no 
likelihood that either a dramatically more rosy or a dramatically more 
pessimistic scenario for China will prevail. For China to succeed in its

reforms well beyond our projections, it would require fundamental 
changes in the political, economic, and social system that are not in the 
cards during the period of this Estimate. Likewise, we believe that the 
party and people would not countenance a new "Cultural Revolution," 
even if the reforms failed miserably. Even if either possibility occurred, 
the forces that would produce such a change would be so cataclysmic as 
to preclude an effective estimate of how US interests might be affected. 
It is safe to say, however, that either a much more powerful China, or 
one that is wracked by turmoil, would pose greater albeit different 
challenges to the United States and would not be in our interest.

DISCUSSION 
Origins of the Reforms 
1. At the heart of China's second revolution is the 
question of how China will modernize, an issue that 
has animated all Chinese political groups in the 20th 
century. With the ending of the Cultural Revolution 
and Mao Zedong's death in 1976, many Chinese were 
convinced that Mao's course had been disastrous. The 
Communist Party's leadership was seriously ques-
tioned; the economy was in bad shape and getting 
worse, and a sense of malaise throughout society was 
growing. This situation enabled Deng Xiaoping to 
make a comeback and to be 'n to reestablish and 
consolidate his position. 
2. Since the Third Plenum of the 11th Central 
Committee in December 1978, Deng has effectively 
led a group of other reform minded leaders in achiev-
ing major political and economic renovations, which 
are now also producing fundamental social change as 
well. These leaders, while accepting and defending the 
primacy of the Communist Party and the maintenance 
of a Marxist-Leninist state, have rejected many of the 
policies identified with Mao, particularly the extrem-
ism of the Cultural Revolution. Though not entirely in 
agreement among themselves as to the scope and pace 
of change, they have identified key areas in which 
change is necessary if China is to enter the next 
century as a modernized, unified, stable, and powerful 
state. In their view: 
? The leadership of the Communist Party and the 
vitality of the state can only be assured if 
authority is successfully institutionalized rather 
than being vested in one charismatic leader. 
? Comprehensive economic modernization and 
improvements in the standard of living require 
material incentives and cannot be achieved by 
relying principally on normative exhortations 
and coercive campaigns. 
? Modernization also requires that ideological pre-
cepts endorse scientific and technical rationality 
rather than undermining it as Maoist dictums on 
"red versus expert" did. 
? To obtain the necessary ingredients for modern-
ization, China must increasingly interact with the 
outside world, particularly the West and Japan. 
25X1 
3. Since the Third Plenum, Deng has had to con-
tend with various forms of opposition to his reform 
agenda. He has compromised when necessary but has 
been highly effective in getting much of his agenda 
adopted. There has been significant change in the 
nature of the Chinese policy debate in the past seven 
years. Unlike the earlier period of Communist rule in 
which wide policy oscillations were the norm, the 
reform program has progressed to the point where 
debate and policy conflict are over pace, scope, and 
tactics rather than on whether reform is needed. In 
other words, even Deng's opponents favor reform. 
Even if the Chinese only "muddle through" in the 25X1 
next few years, it is unlikely that there will be 
dramatic leadership or policy shifts over whether 
reforms are desirable 
The Political Agenda 
4. Deng and his supporters have said that for the 
entire reform agenda to succeed, both political struc-
tures and key personnel must be changed. They have 
championed a number of institutional changes to 
enhance the efficiency and legitimacy of the party. 
These involve:

SECRET 
? Reorganizing the party. The key changes in-
clude the rehabilitation of the Secretariat, the 
abolition of the Chairmanship, and the restruc-
turing of commissions within the Central Com-
mittee. The purpose is to provide more discipline 
and responsiveness to party organizations. 
? Separating party and state functions. There has 
been a major reorganization of the state appara-
tus, including the restoration of the position of 
President of the People's Republic, a reduction in 
the number of ministries in the State Council 
with a corresponding reduction in the number of 
Vice Premiers, and an effort to set up a new state 
military commission. Deng has said that the 
party should withdraw from a policy implemen-
tation role and should focus on leadership. The 
purpose here is to prevent the concentration of 
power in one organ or person, an abuse that 
Deng believes led to the excesses of the Cultural 
Revolution.

Reform Benchmarks 
January 1975?First Session, Fourth National Peo-
ple's Congress. Premier Zhou Enlai's report calls for 
increased efforts to promote the -four modernizations": 
of agriculture, industry, national defense, and science 
and technology. Political infighting in the Politburo 
delayed implementation of specific policies. 
December 1978?Third Plenum, 11th Central Com-
mittee. Deng Xiaoping begins to assume leadership, 
eclipsing Party Chairman and State Council Premier 
Hua Guofeng; reform program initiated. 
February 1980?Fifth Plenum, 11th Central Com-
mittee. Some key opponents of reform purged thereby 
weakening "leftist" influence in the Politburo; Party 
Secretariat established. 
August-September 1980. Deng proposes separation of 
party and government functions, emphasizes collective 
leadership and retirement of superannuated officials to 
open door for more highly qualified personnel; Hua 
replaced as Premier by Zhao Ziyang. 
December 1980. Politburo suspends Hua from offi-
cial duties. Deng assumes leadership of Central Com-
mittee Military Commission; Hu Yaobang takes charge 
of party bureaucracy. 
June 1981?Sixth Plenum, 11th Central Committee. 
Hu replaces Hua as Party Chairman; over some opposi-
tion, Deng wins approval of "Resolution on Party 
History," which is sharply critical of many of Mao's 
policies and some of his ideological precepts. 
September 1982-12th Party Congress. New party 
constitution abolishes Chairmanship; Hu becomes Gen-
eral Secretary; Agricultural -responsibility system" im-
plemented on national basis. 
November 1982?Fifth Session, Fifth National Peo-
ple's Congress. New state constitution adopted, which 
restored position of President, Peoples Republic of 
China, fixes terms of office for most top state officials at 
five years, and replaces communes with townships as 
basic administrative unit. 
October 1983?Second Plenum, 12th Central Com-
mittee. Kicks off party "rectification" campaign de-
signed to weed out "leftist" and incompetent cadres at 
all levels of the party. 
October 1984?Third Plenum, 12th Central Com-
mittee. Resolution adopted extending reform to include 
government control of industry, some price controls, 
and central planning. 
September 1985?Party Conference of Delegates. 
Retires large number of aged party, government, and 
military leaders; approves the principal direction of the 
Seventh Five-Year Plan. 
March 1986?National People's Congress. Approves 
Seventh Five-Year Plan, which calls for modest eco-
nomic growth and reaffirms China's commitment to 
reform and the "open door" but contains no new 
reform initiatives. 
? Revamping ideology. While defending the legiti-
macy of "Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong 
Thought," the reformers are redefining it to 
support their pragmatic policies. Gone is the 
emphasis on "class struggle," "better red than 
expert," and other Maoist ideological exhorta-
tions. Now ideology must make acceptable mar-
ket forces in the economy, foreign investments, 
and other policies that "seek truth from facts"; 
the legitimacy of party authority increasingly is 
explained in economic performance terms rather 
than more obscure theoretical constructs. 
? Establishing the principle of legality. Besides 
reinvigorating legal institutions, such as the proc-
uracy (which prosecutes cases) and the courts, 
and enacting a legal code and new laws affecting 
all facets of society, Deng and his associates have 
created the expectation that there will be some 
limits on the exercise of authority by the state. 
Increased predictability and controls on the arbi-
trary exercise of authority will enable the regime 
to obtain greater commitment from its citizens, 
especially the intellectuals whose willing partici-
pation is required if modernization is to work. 
5. A major effort is also being made to invigorate 
institutions by recruitment policies that favor younger 
and more educated people. Without completely abol-
ishing widespread family favoritism and guanxi (per-
sonal relationship) networks, Deng and his supporters 
are implementing a personnel system which: 
? Establish an age limit for various offices in 
party and government. An age limit of 65 for 
government ministers and 60 for vice ministers 
has been established. The age limit is 68 for 
ordinary Central Committee members but for 
Politburo members the age is uncertain; press 
sources indicate that it ranges from 70 to 72.

According to Deng, 81, a "few old cadres" will 
keep their positions "for a while." According to 
General Secretary Hu Yaobang, 70, the retention 
of some older veterans who are still in good 
health is the "common desire" of the entire party 
membership and "in their fundamental interest." 
Since 1984, 47 ministers and directors of Central 
Committee and State Council Departments have 
been replaced, along with 80 of their deputies. At 
the provincial level, 14 of the 27 provincial-level 
administrative units have had new party secre-
taries, and 10 have had new governors. Nearly all 
of these changes reflect the new age limitations. 
? Ensures that better educated and more quali-
fied personnel are appointed to party and gov-
ernment positions. More than three-fourths of 
the 64 new members of the Central Committee 
appointed at the September 1985 National Con-
ference of Delegates had received higher educa-
tion?meaning a college degree or training at a 
technical school or military staff school. This 
emphasis on educational qualifications now ex-
tends throughout the system. 
? Promotes persons who will be supportive of the 
reforms. The age restrictions have enabled Deng 
to remove some senior leaders opposed to his 
policies, while the new recruitment guidelines 
help him to place his proteges in key positions. 
6. Deng and his supporters believe that these politi-
cal changes are vital if China is not to experience the 
excesses of the Cultural Revolution, when one individ-
ual was able to manipulate the levers of power, 
wreaking great havoc on the nation 
7. These changes do not mean that the system of 
favoritism for relatives and guanxi networks endemic 
to Chinese political life will be speedily abolished. 
Evidence suggests that children of high-ranking offi-
cials are heavily favored in recruitment for desirable 
positions in government and industry, 1 and guanxi 
plays a very significant role in determining who will 
be promoted. For example, it is strongly believed that 
the newly appointed Ministers for Public Security and 
State Security were chosen not primarily because of 
their qualifications, but because of their personal ties 
to Hu Yaobang. 
8. Reformers are not political liberals who favor 
individual rights and democratic procedures. Quite 
the contrary, they are deeply committed to what they

Revitalizing China's Economy and Society 
9. As Deng and his supporters seek to reform 
Chinese politics, they also recognize that the success of 
the second revolution also hinges on achieving eco-
nomic progress. Among the most important areas are: 
? Narrowing the scope of central planning and 
gradually allowing market forces to determine 
more economic activity, while maintaining eco-
nomic stability by means of monetary and fiscal 
policies. 
? Improving efficiency, productivity, and quality 
in production by providing enterprise managers 
and farmers more authority over planning, 
output, and marketing; by demanding greater 
fiscal responsibility; and by breaking up vertical-
ly organized relations and encouraging competi-
tion between economic units. 
11 
SECRET 
? Raising the standard of living by allowing more 
individual freedom to exercise entrepreneurial 
skills and accumulate wealth, and by promoting 
more production of consumer goods while devel-
oping new policies to help the economically 
disadvantaged. 
? Developing more effective financial institutions 
to improve allocation of funds, monitor enter-
prise activity, and influence the rate and direc-
tion of economic development.

? Gradually eliminating government intervention 
that stifles economic growth, such as controls on 
prices, rents, and wages. 
? Promoting development of a relatively unregu-
lated tertiary economic sector, such as service 
industries, small-scale transport, and marketing. 
? Opening China's economy to foreign participa-
tion in order to acquire advanced technology, 
investment capital, and management skills. 
? Giving priority to existing industrial bases. 
10. The political and economic reforms are being 
accompanied by social changes as well. Chief social 
goals include: 
? Revamping the education system, giving priority 
to scientific and technical skills. Admissions to 
colleges and universities are to be based on 
qualifying examinations, and a system of degrees 
has been restored. 
? Easing limits on artistic and cultural expression. 
? Giving intellectuals a more prominent role in 
party and government affairs and extending 
greater prestige to intellectual endeavors. 
? Easing public restraints over religious observance 
and over cultural expression by national 
minorities. 
These social changes are seen as necessary for creating 
greater popular support for the party. Nevertheless, 
some key controls will remain in place: birth control, 
migration, and labor unions 
Military Reforms 
11. Deng and his reformist colleagues want a mili-
tary that is leaner, more professional, and better 
trained and armed. In pursuit of this objective they 
have: 
? Pushed for a younger and more educated officer 
corps with greater technical specialization. Older 
officers have been forced into retirement and 
younger ones promoted. 
? Begun implementing a reduction in the overall 
size of the armed forces by over 1 million 
personnel, from about 4.5 million to 3.5 million. 
This is being done to save money and improve 
the quality of recruits. 
? Reduced the role of military units in the econo-
my?for example, they have taken the Railway 
Construction Corps and the Capital Construc-
tions Engineer Corps out of PLA control?while 
at the same time using many defense industries 
for civilian production. 
? Reorganized military regions and commands to 
simplify command and control. 
? Acquired and deployed improved weapons and 
equipment from foreign and indigenous sources. 
12. Through these changes in the PLA, Deng be-
lieves that its mission of providing national security 
can be accomplished more effectively and less expen-
sively. At the same time, the military as an institution 
may become less likely to play a significant domestic 
political role to the degree it did during the Cultural 
Revolution. Thus far, there have not been substantial 
increases in the military budget?the published mili-
tary budget has actually been somewhat reduced since 
1979?but should the PLA go forward with an-
nounced intentions of improving weapons technology, 
costs could increase substantially. In any case, the 
success of the military modernization depends on the 
success of the economic program. We believe that the 
reformers will hold to their policy of selectively and 
gradually improving weapons technology, avoiding the 
expense that would be entailed in a rapid buildup. 
Accomplishments 
13. The reforms have already had a fundamental 
impact on Chinese politics, economics, and society. 
More than 1.2 million cadres at various levels have 
been retired. Of 200,000 younger cadres promoted to 
posts at or above the county level, 60 percent have 
college or university degrees. At the most recent party 
conference of delegates in September, 10 elderly 
members of the Politburo resigned and were replaced 
by six younger persons, and 64 older members of the 
Central Committee resigned in favor of younger and 
more technically qualified persons.2 
14. Even more dramatic have been the economic 
changes in China. Annual growth over the past few 
years has been running at about 9 to 10 percent, well 
above the growth target Beijing needs to accomplish its 
goal of quadrupling the total value of industrial and 
agricultural output by the year 2000 (see table). The

"contract responsibility system" has led to an unprece-
dented boom in many of China's rural areas both in 
terms of productivity and peasant income. 
15. The overall standard of living of the Chinese 
people has improved considerably. Coupon rationing 
has ended for clothing and most foods. Rural dwellers 
have seen their annual per capita income more than 
double since 1978, up to about 300 yuan. The gap 
between rural and urban living standards has nar-
rowed significantly. There is a wider variety of prod-
ucts and consumer goods available. 
16. The reforms are perceived by most Chinese as 
having delivered the goods thus far, and the reformers 
are counting on popular support to keep the momen-
tum going. Chinese leaders repeatedly assure foreign 
visitors that the reforms are highly popular and for this 
reason can be successfully continued. 
Reform Obstacles 
17. In spite of these accomplishments, the pace of 
reforms and the degree of implementation have been 
and will be uneven because of both technical obstacles 
and political resistance. Among the chief technical 
obstacles are: 
? Problems in developing the managerial talent. 
Many economic managers have successfully 
achieved goals based on quantitative production

but are now expected to perform in an environ-
ment that demands quality, innovation, market-
ing skill, and profits. The educational system will 
have great difficulty providing the skilled man-
agers China needs. 
? Shortcomings in financial capabilities. As the 
1985 foreign exchange scare?in which the Chi-
nese discovered their reserves were being deplet-
ed much more rapidly than anticipated and 
moved quickly to regain central control over 
outflows?amply demonstrates, China may have 
difficulty committing the financial resources 
necessary for infrastructural development at the 
appropriate time. Additionally, the unleashing of 
strong inflationary pressures by the reforms has 
disrupted both investment and planning. 
? Difficulties in acquiring and absorbing technol-
ogy. Certain technologies are unavailable owing 
to COCOM restrictions or because Western en-
terprises refuse to provide it, fearing that the 
Chinese will subsequently use it to compete with 
them. Even so, a number of reports suggest that 
Beijing has acquired expensive technology from 
abroad only to have it remain unused for want of 
trained personnel.

energy and transportation. China's short-term

Special Economic Zones: 
A Test of the Reforms a 
At the urging of Deng Xiaoping, in 1979 the State 
Council authorized the creation of special economic 
zones as part of a policy directed at liberalizing the 
foreign trade system and opening the economy to the 
West. Four zones were established to spur and concen-
trate foreign investment, Xiamen and Sharitou designed 
to concentrate on developing export processing indus-
tries and Shenzhen and Zhuhai, bordering on Hong 
Kong and Macao respectively, designed for more diver-
sified development. All four zones offered investors 
low-cost labor, reduced rents and taxes, and scaled 
down or waived customs duties. They sought to attract 
foreign investment in infrastructure projects as well as 
in industries that would promote exports and enhance 
technological development. Responding to the charge of 
critics that the Special Economic Zones (SEZs) were like 
the treaty ports of the past, the reformers asserted that 
unlike the situation in the past, foreign involvement 
would be on Chinese terms, not forced by the foreign-
ers. 
Initially, the development of the SEZs was sluggish, 
but beginning in 1983 there was rapid expansion, 
particularly in Shenzhen. By 1984 Shenzhen had at-
tracted 70 percent of the total foreign funds invested in 
SEZs and 15 percent of total realized foreign investment 
in China. This, together with heavy state investment in 
infrastructural projects, resulted in a major boom. In 
early 1984, Deng visited Shenzhen and praised the 
results. His visit seemed to allay concern that the SEZ 
experiment would be short lived. Indeed, the gross 
value of industrial and agricultural output in the four 
zones went from 2.1 billion yuan in 1983 to 3.3 billion 
yuan in 1984, with Shenzhen accounting for about 50 
Percent of the growth. (s NF NC) 
a See INR Report 1120-AR, China's Special Economic Zones: Less 
Progress than Meets the Eye, 2 July 1985 
However, some unforeseen results caused Chinese 
policymakers to again have second thoughts. Most of the 
investment has gone into construction rather than in-
creases in production; also, only about one-third of sales 
from the SEZs have been made abroad, while two-
thirds have been in China. Export goals for Shenzhen 
were supposed to reach US $5.2 billion by 1990, but 
between 1980 and 1983 they increased only from US 
$11.2 million to $21.1 million, a tiny fraction of official 
projections. In 1984 the four zones ran a trade deficit of 
US $2 billion. In general, the SEZs have failed to serve 
the anticipated investment function and have failed to 
attract technology-intensive industry. Also, there is 
some consternation that they have led to corruption and 
the spread of -spiritual pollution- in China. 
In mid-1985 Chinese leaders seemed to be hedging 
their bets on the SEZs. Deng referred to them as 
'experimental- and suggested that they could be shut 
down if their purpose was not achieved. Cu Mu, who 
carried the SEZ portfolio in the Secretariat, gave SEZ 
performance a mixed review in a newspaper interview 
in April 1985. Cu was removed from the Secretariat at 
the Party National Conference of Delegates in Septem-
ber. 
The SEZ's lackluster record in obtaining key objec-
tives has probably tarnished the credibility of the 
policy, if not the policymakers. Reformers are nimbly 
switching their strategy for China's modernization and 
are now focusing on upgrading technology in major 
industrial centers through licensing agreements and 
joint ventures. However, it seems unlikely that the SEZ 
concept will be abandoned; rather, they will most likely 
record modest gains as they compete with other open-
ing Chinese industrial cities for foreign investment. 
energy approach involves dependence on coal-fired 
plants, which create pollution and place an added 
burden on mining and transportation. The long-term 
plan calls for expensive nuclear and hydroelectric 
projects, which will have no payoffs until the 1990s. 
Transportation is a serious problem, which only sub-
stantial investment can help to solve. Chinese railways 
are 70 percent overbooked, and port congestion is 
extremely severe. Attempts to increase highway use 
for short haul commerce will be costly and will 
increase demand for fuels that the energy sector may 
not be able to provide. 
18. Reform policies have generated or exacerbated 
a host of serious difficulties in China's economy. 
Among these problems are double-digit inflation, a 
rise in official corruption, socially disruptive income 
disparities, and regional inequality. These problems 
have generated both social discontent, as measured by 
student demonstrations, and political controversy at 
the highest levels. 
19. There is also political resistance to the reforms. 
Significant issues include: 
? Strong differences among the leadership as to 
the extent and pace of reform. Some leaders 
have tried to slow and modify the reforms 
because they believe that moving too rapidly and 
too far is undermining party authority. 
? The fear of losing power and perks among 
senior officials who are being retired.

We must intensify ideological and political work and 
preserve the prestige of the party's departments in charge of 
this work. There are now some people, including some party 
members, who have forsaken the socialist and Communist 
ideal and turned their backs on serving the people. Some of 
them have become rich by unlawful means such as specula-
tion and swindle, graft, and acceptance of bribes. In their 
dealings with foreigners, they have no consideration of 
personal or national dignity. These problems can be attribut-
ed to the relation of ideological and political work and the 
decline in the function and authority of departments in 
charge of such work. We should take this as a lesson. Party 
organizations at all levels should conduct ideological and 
political work in earnest and safeguard the authority of those 
departments.

Delegates, September 1985. 
? The concern among some officials, particularly 
lower ranking cadres, that the reforms will not 
endure. These officials adopt a "wait and see" 
attitude and move slowly and cautiously, if at all, 
in implementing directives. 
? Concern that the rapid opening to the West will 
allow unhealthy influences to enter China and 
will also make China too dependent on foreign 
countries 
20. Thus far, both Deng and his opponents have 
sought to avoid a showdown on the issue that must 
inevitably arise: will economic modernization require 
a loosening of ideological strictures and political con-
trols? To date we judge that the party remains deeply 
divided on this issue. The dilemma of trading political 
control for improved economic performance will re-

21. The party's ability to overcome obstacles to 
reform and to continue with the second revolution 
hinges on how orderly the succession to Deng is 
accomplished. The mechanisms are in place for an 
orderly succession, but the future of reform depends 
on the nature, character, and policies of Deng's succes-
sors. Deng has given a high priority to putting in place 
those persons he deems most committed to reform, yet 
On prospects for the succession to Deng, see forthcoming SNIE 
13-86 May 1986, China After Deng: Succes-
sion Problems and Prospects. 
he has also had to accept the promotion of proteges of 
other leaders, including those who have been opposed 
to some elements of the reforms. Reform success owes 
much to Deng's political skills and ability to negotiate 
among competing interests. We doubt that his succes-
sor will have the same commitment to reform or his 
negotiating ability. Nevertheless, we believe that the 
leadership that emerges after Deng for the most part 
will share his goals and priorities even though it will 
include some who favor a different approach 
External Influences 
22. China's reform effort has been perceptibly in-
fluenced by external forces and will continue to be so 
over the coming decade. Of particular importance has 
been the shift in Chinese perceptions of threat and a 
corresponding shift in foreign policy emphasis. Chi-
nese demands for a -united front" against Soviet 
-hegemonism,- heard during the high tide of Sino-US 
cooperation in 1979, have given way to the declaration 
of an -independent- foreign policy that seeks to treat 
the superpowers more evenhandedly. While there has 
been no substantive Soviet change on key issues that 
divide Beijing and Moscow, Chinese perceptions have 
shifted. They believe: 
? The United States has increased its power and 
vigilence against the Soviet threat. 
? The Soviets are becoming overextended in their 
activities in Afghanistan and Vietnam and are 
also distracted by their problems at home and in 
Eastern Europe. 
? Avoiding armed conflict is essential so that China 
will have time and resources to modernize. 
? New Soviet leadership might be eventually more 
forthcoming on China's three major conditions 
for normalizing relations. 
In the past few years, China's stated rationale for 
cooperation with the West has progressively shifted 
from the strategic countering of Soviet power to their 
expressed desire for financial and technological sup-
port for China's modernization. 
23. China has fostered improved ties to the Soviet 
Union, and rapid gains in trade, perhaps as much as $6 
billion annually by the end of the decade, are antici-
pated in the 1986-90 trade agreement concluded by 
the two parties. Though far less than China's trade 
with the West, this trade expansion is evidence of

Chinese willingness to obscure or overlook some politi-
cal differences while seeking modernization. In partic-
ular, the Chinese probably will continue to use care in 
dealing with especially sensitive issues in order not to 
jeopardize potential Soviet contributions to Chinese 
modernization. 
24. The pace and degree of Chinese reforms are 
partly influenced by how successful the Chinese be-
lieve they will be in acquiring modernization resources 
in the West, principally from the United States. The 
United States is currently the largest foreign investor 
in China, after Hong Kong, and has worked to pro-
mote trade and economic cooperation. There are 
15,000 Chinese students in the United States, the 
largest number abroad in any country, and the re-
formers perceive that these students are a fundamen-
tal means of acquiring expertise. We believe that 
Beijing is increasingly concerned with issues such as 
trade, investment, student exchange, and the US role 
in COCOM restrictions on China. Chinese attitudes 
toward military cooperation with the United States are 
mixed. Some elements of the leadership favor limited 
military cooperation as a means of promoting military 
modernization while others want to downplay such 
cooperation 
25. Chinese leaders believe that Japan can make an 
important economic and technological contribution to 
China's modernization, but they remain suspicious of 
Japanese intentions. There are mixed feelings about 
Japan's role in such projects as the Baoshan steel 
project that helped to modernize China's steel industry 
but at enormous expense. Deng recently stated that 
continuing trade deficits with Japan were unaccept-
able, while others have complained of Japan's lack of 
investment in China. Below the surface of official 
good will between the two nations, there is lingering 
hostility as evidenced by student demonstrations 
against Japan in the fall of 1985 
China's Future: The Most Likely Prospect 
26. Deng and his reformist colleagues have already 
scored remarkable achievements in reorganizing the 
political infrastructure and improving economic pro-
ductivity in certain sectors, such as agriculture, where 
reform policies have been applied most extensively. 
The economic reforms in China have brought unprec-
edented prosperity and have given the people a stake 
in the continuation of reform. Reform policies have 
been implemented in a -two steps forward, one step 
back" fashion, and we expect this pattern to continue. 
We believe, on balance, that the Chinese leadership 
has demonstrated sufficient success in achieving their 
goals of creating a more united, stable, and powerful 
China, and that the general trend of reform will 
continue during the period of this Estimate. 
27. Nevertheless, we believe that over the next 10 
years there will be continuing political and economic 
problems facing the Chinese leadership that have a 
potential to threaten reform. That is, there will be 
incessant disputes over the scale, pace, and side effects 
of reform, and leadership shifts will occur as various 
members of the second generation attempt to strength-
en their respective positions. But, we do not believe 
these will lead to major turmoil, as occurred during 
the Cultural Revolution, and will be confined to the 
type of struggle that we have witnessed since the 
Third Plenum in 1978. 
28. Economic performance is most likely to support 
a continuation of reform policies. Despite problems 
with excessive growth, inflation, and corruption, 
China's robust economy (see table) has generated 
popular and political support that probably will carry 
the leadership through the inevitable cyclical down-
turns and lean years. The reformers' ability to discover 
and respond to problems in the economy has been an 
important factor in their record of success, and we 
expect this flexibility to be maintained. 
29. Over the next 10 years, key features of a 
developing China probably will include: 
16 
SECRET 
? A party leadership that dominates policy formu-
lation across the board. 
? A bureaucracy staffed by relatively young, tech-
nically capable personnel. 
A social system that reflects tensions between 
economic liberalization and political control. 
? An avowed centrally planned economy that at-
tempts to make use of both market forces and 
political intervention to influence its develop-
ment and encourages flexibility and competition 
within certain carefully described sectors. 
? An extensive web of interlocking trade, techno-
logical and financial relationships with other 
countries, mainly Western and Japan. 
? An approach to foreign policy issues that is more 
activist but dominated by a desire to avoid 
unnecessary external conflict that would inter-
fere with a continuing focus on modernization.

30. As China becomes more prosperous, its foreign 
policy options will increase. It will seek to play a 
greater role in international and regional affairs. 
China will publicly adhere to its -independent- pos-
ture and will rhetorically support various Third World 
positions in the United Nations and in other interna-
tional forums. At the same time, China will continue 
to emphasize orderly economic, financial, and trade 
ties to the West. Within Asia, China will seek to 
augment its role as a regional power, recognizing that 
the United States and the USSR are actively engaged 
in the region, but seeking over the longer term to 
reduce that involvement. Specifically, we believe that 
China will: 
? Increasingly seek arrangements in Korea that will 
enhance prospects for peace and stability in the 
peninsula. 
? Continue to demand a solution to the Cambodia 
conflict that acknowledges Chinese interests and 
influence in Indochina. 
? Attempt to avoid military action except perhaps 
in the South China Sea where overlapping terri-
torial claims involve several countries, including 
Vietnam. 
31. We believe that China will not move signifi-
cantly closer to the Soviet Union. Normalization of 
Sino-Soviet relations may move forward, perhaps, 
even including a restoration of party to party ties. 
Even in that exigency, the Chinese will not cooperate 
with the Soviets against the United States, because the 
West will remain more important to China as a source 
of technology, investment, and other economic advan-
tages. China will improve economic relations with the 
USSR but will most likely continue to regard the Soviet 
Union as a major competitor for influence in East Asia 
and a strategic military threat. 
32. Greater production of a wider range of goods 
will mean that China will compete more assertively 
with newly industrialized countries to sell to foreign 
markets, especially in the developed countries. China 
will also maintain an aggressive policy of arms sales 
abroad, which, with technological improvements, will 
make it increasingly competitive in this market. 
China's increasing economic strength will make it 
even more attractive to foreigners in both market and 
investment terms, which in turn will enable the 
Chinese to play one country against another in order 
to obtain the best possible terms. Developing countries 
in East Asia will feel increasing pressure from China's 
development. 
A Less Likely Alternative: The Reforms Collapse 
33. We believe that another plausible though less 
likely outcome is a situation in which technical and 
political problems gradually overwhelm the reforms. 
This would entail a permanent recentralization of 
authority and a tightening of economic controls. Such 
a situation could be brought about by: 
? A series of major economic setbacks, such as 
runaway inflation, successive poor harvests, or 
stagnant industrial growth. 
? Widespread demands for greater personal and 
political freedoms that appear to threaten the 
party's control. 
? Political unrest among segments of the popula-
tion resulting from a perception of disadvantage. 
25X1 
25X1 
34. S ou t ese, or other potential developments, 
result in the ending of reforms, we would anticipate 
the following situation: 
? Intensified infighting among party elites, accom-
panied by signs of policy immobilism and ideo-
logical dogmatism. 
? Growing tension in the bureaucracy as technical-
ly qualified personnel lose authority to anti- 25X1 
reform party ideologues. 
? A social system characterized by increasing un-
rest as the regime moves to dismantle reforms 
and reimpose central authority. 
? The broadened application of central planning 
and limitations on market forces in the economy. 
? An increased emphasis on self reliance, perhaps 
including attempts to limit foreign participation 
in China's economy. 
? A foreign policy lacking initiative but pursued in 
a truculent manner. 
35. This more centralized and repressive regime 
probably would not be able to resolve China's econom-
ic problems, and popular support would dwindle over 
time. This alternative could also be accompanied by 
an upsurge in Chinese nationalism. The Chinese would 
be most likely to blame the developed countries for 
their problems but would remain suspicious of Soviet 
intentions toward China. China would escalate its 
Third World rhetoric and might allow territorial 
problems with its neighbors to become more serious. 
The Hong Kong settlement could unravel, causing the 
Taiwan issue to become more difficult. We believe, 
however, that political unrest and nationalistic excesses 
on the scale of the Cultural Revolution would be 
unlikely

Can China Dramatically Succeed or Fail Beyond 
Our Expectations? 
36. We believe it is highly unlikely that the Chinese 
reforms will succeed dramatically or fail miserably. In 
order for the reforms to accomplish much more than 
we anticipate: 
? The role of the party would have to be further 
diminished and greater political pluralism 
introduced. 
? Marxist-Leninist ideology would have to cease to 
be the basis of legitimate authority. 
? The bureaucracy would have to become much 
more technically skilled and insulated from polit-
ical shifts. 
? The economy would require much less govern-
ment intervention and would give primacy to 
market forces. 
? In exchange for Western know-how and technol-
ogy, China would have to grant much greater 
foreign access to its domestic markets. 
Over the period of this Estimate it is highly unlikely 
that the Communist Party would countenance changes 
of this magnitude, preferring to maintain control 
rather than rapidly accelerate the pace of moderniza-
tion 
37. It is also highly unlikely that the reforms will 
precipitate a major economic or political collapse with 
accompanying Cultural Revolution style xenophobia. 
Causes of such a collapse would include: 
? A complete breakdown of consensus among the 
leadership, resulting in violent political turbu-
lence, purges, and probably military 
intervention. 
? The emergence of regional power centers com-
peting with Beijing for political authority. 
? Extreme social polarization and the emergence 
of ideological fanaticism. 
? Bureaucratic paralysis leading to failure to im-
plement policies effectively. 
? Stagflation, increased unemployment, crop fail-
ures and famine, or other dislocations of such 
magnitude that the reforms are totally 
discredited. 
We believe that having come close to this type of 
political and economic collapse during the Cultural 
Revolution, Chinese leaders, regardless of their atti-
tude toward reform, will try to undertake whatever 
steps are necessary to prevent this degree of systemic 
breakdown 
Implications for the United States 
38. Our most likely alternative for China's future 
offers a mixed but basically favorable situation for the 
United States. A more politically stable and economi-
cally prosperous China with increased ties to and 
interactions with the United States, Japan, and other 
Western countries has been a goal of US policy for a 
decade or more. In this respect, the progress of China's 
reforms compliment US policy. Nevertheless, the very 
success of these reforms will bring both opportunities 
and challenges for US policymakers as they deal with a 
more capable and confident China in the decades 
ahead. 
39. We believe that the key opportunities for the 
United States will be: 
? A potential for the expansion of mutual trade 
and investment. 
? Continued areas of political cooperation; specifi-
cally, both sides will wish to limit Soviet power 
and influence in the region and will want peace 
and stability on the Korean Peninsula. 
? Some limited expansion of military cooperation, 
primarily in the regularization of exchanges at 
various levels; however, we believe that China 
will not wish to rapidly expand military acquisi-
tions from the United States. 
? Better cultural ties and understanding because 
China will wish to maintain a broad level of 
student, cultural, and scientific exchange. 
? A potential to influence a generation of Chinese 
elites, exposed to the United States through a 
variety of exchanges 
40. We believe that the key challenges for the 
United States will be: 
18 
SECRET 
? Continuing pressure on the United States to 
reduce arms sales to Taiwan. 
? Increasing pressure on the United States to con-
vince Taiwan to accept Beijing's terms for na-
tional reconciliation. 
? Continuing, and perhaps escalating, demands 
that the United States transfer sensitive technol-
ogy to China and reduce third-party transfer 
restrictions. 
? Continuing pressure for US concessions on trade 
and investment. 
? Growing Chinese competitiveness in East Asian 
markets.

41. The gradual growth of Chinese power and 
influence will complicate US relations with other 
countries in the region. Many Southeast Asian coun-
tries view China as an economic competitor and will 
become alarmed as China increases its access to US 
and other Western markets. Increasing Chinese mili-
tary power will be viewed with concern by some Asian 
countries that will try to persuade the United States to 
place restraints on its assistance to Chinese military 
modernization; these countries do not appreciate the 
limits of US influence on China. 
42. A moderately successful reformist leadership 
will seek to maintain or enhance China's position 
within the strategic triangle. The attitude of close, 
strategic cooperation with the United States against the 
Soviet Union that China evoked in the 1970s is not 
likely to reoccur during the period of this Estimate. 
Rather, China will most likely seek to find ways to 
exploit differences between the United States and the 
Soviet nun t enhance its own position in the 
triangle. 
43. In the event that our less likely, but plausible, 
scenario unfolds, China would become a more serious 
challenge to US interests because it would probably be 
even more stubborn in asserting its demands. We 
would anticipate that: 
? Cooperative Sino-US economic ties would be 
reduced. 
? Beijing would most likely escalate its demands 
that the United States stop arms sales to Taiwan. 
25X1 
? Military cooperation with the United States 
would be cut back. 
? Exchanges in scientific, technical, cultural, and 
other areas would falter. 
? China would increasingly adopt an anti-US pos-
ture in international fora and in propaganda. 
25X1 
44. Under these circumstances we could expect that 
China would be more assertive on regional issues25X1 
China might renew moral and political ties to pro-
Beijing Southeast Asian Communist movements and 
under some circumstances might be willing to slightly 
upgrade ties to these groups. While some leaders might 
also want to reduce tension with the USSR and 
develop closer ties to replace links to the West, this 
tendency would be mitigated by  lingering suspicions 
of Soviet intentions toward China 25X1 
45. Reform in China is a complex political, eco-25X1 
nomic, and social phenomenon whose future course 
cannot be precisely predicted. The continuity or aban-
donment of the policies and structural changes that 
emerge from the -second revolution- will have impor-
tant implications for US interests in Asia and else-
where. We believe, however, that stunning success or 
ignominious failure is not only highly unlikely, but are 
tied to so many imponderables as to mitigate against 
projecting specific implication of these alternatives for 
the United States.
