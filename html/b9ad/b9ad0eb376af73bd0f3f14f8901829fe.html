THE NEW *RAVEN ItAniftor, Arrb 
MERGER PLANS 
Mr. MMICOFE. Mr. President, the 
corranutere using the New Trairen Rail-
road received a rude rebuff -yesterday 
from the New York Central and the 
Pennsylvania nailroids. These two giant 
coMPAnfis, seeking ICC permission to 
merge into a still larger combine, gave 
the ICC three proposals for leaving the 
, New fleven opt of their proposed merger 
plans. Tinder bull of the proposed 
merger plans, the New Raven is left out 
in .the Cold, and So are the Ne* Raven's 
comnititere, 
If there is to be any Merger at all, it is 
vital that the Nevillavenpaseerigir serv-
ice be included The New 'Stork -Central 
and the Pennsylvania show a callous dis-
? regard. of the public interest by ignoring 
'al.ii basic fact. Naturally, the sole con-
cern of these two major carriers is to 
seek inclusion only of prohtable routes, 
; regardless of the needs of passengers. 
Fortunately, the ICC applies a higher 
standard?that of making sure the pub-
lic intereet is served. 
. Any merger that failed to include the 
'New Haven's passenger service would 
clearly not be in the public interest. I 
, believe the- ICC recognizes this.; but 
should it decision on the merger appli-
cation ignore this fact, I will initiate 
whatever legislative action may be nec-
essary to block such a result. 
The New York Central and the Penn-
sylvania must not be allowed to consoli-
date their position in the New 'pork Met-
ropolitan area without making provision 
for the needs' el one Of the largest groups 
a rail users in that area. The alterna-
tives, whip.' the major carriers suggested
yesterday are 'thoroughly -inirearStic. 
They seek the benefits Of Merger, with-
out the responsibility of Service to corn-
` rkaters. They must not be permitted "to 
have it both ways." 
DA-O sricsg   
nil OP ,VVORTall 
Mr. rt;IBTCOPP. Mr. President, on 
- May 19, I inserted in the CONGRESSIONAL 
Ftgcoan a radio script about the urgent 
need for day-pare services for the 5m11-
lion young children of working moth-
. isto 109-8 
ers?almost half a million of whom are 
left to drift on their own, each day. This 
was one of the programs, entitled "Di-
mension of a Woman's World," by the 
noted radio and television commentator, 
Betty Furness. 
Miss Furness has now followed up this 
program with another on the services for 
these children?and what they should 
be. I ask unanimous consent that it be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the script 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
DIMENSION OF A WOMAN'S WORLD 
Day care for young children can be one of 
the most important services a community 
can offer. It can hold families together when 
a mother is ill?or troubled, or most often, 
has to work. (And today, millions of moth-
ers with young children, do have to work.) 
Good day-care services can provide help for 
children with problems, emotional or physi-
cal. It can bring out into the world, young 
children who because they are blind or 
handicapped might otherwise be absolutely 
housebound. 
Many communities have been reluctant to 
supply day-care services on the grounds that 
they are somehow a sweet but unnecessary 
charity?kind of like an organized babysit-
ting club. But this is a very unrealistic point 
of view. 
We talked to people at the National Com-
mittee for the Day Care of Children and they 
point out that year after year we spend 
money trying to rehabilitate children, who 
through neglect have gotten into trouble. 
In corny, old-fashioned language, they've 
simply had bad starts in life. 
Why, these experts demand, do we have to 
wait for a family to collapse before we move 
In to help them? How can we allow almost 
half a million children to wander around in 
neglect?for whatever reason? 
That day-care service Ls desperately needed 
all over the country, is indisputable, that it 
comes in many forms, however, is often not 
known. 
Most people are familiar with centers for 
preschool children, and we'll get back to 
these in a minute. But there are other 
kinds of day-care services. For instance, 
housekeepers are provided when parents are 
sick and simply can't take care of their chil-
dren. Or sometimes when a mother has died 
and a father is left on his own with little 
children to cope with. 
In these cases, a really good, trained-per-
son, can often held a family together until 
the children grow older or the parents are 
able to take over for themselves. 
Sometimes a family can afford to help pay 
for these services?sometimes they can't. 
But even if an agency has to assume the full 
cost of a housekeeper's salary for several 
years, it is still far cheaper than breaking up 
the family and sending the children to in-
stitutions or foster homes. 
Cheaper in terms of money, and certainly 
cheaper in terms of people's lives. 
A similar service is provided by some agen-
cies for children under three. These babies 
are simply too young to join a day-care 
group. They do not do well thrown in 
with a lot of other children, so instead they 
are often pared for in private homes on a 
daily basis. 'their mothers bring them in 
the morning, pick them up at night, and are 
With them over the weekend. 
The day-care centers take 'are -Orthe-1-` 
to 6-year-olds. 
And researching this subject we discovered 
that many people resist the idea of provid-
ing these facilities because they are against 
women with young children going out to 
200176057-8 
12003 
work. This is " also unrealistic; because 
whether it is ideal or not, many of these peo-
ple have no choice. They work because they 
have to. And this is where the communities 
help is necessary. 
How do you build a day care center? Well, 
in most towns the first step is convincing 
people that there is a need. And the Na-
tional Committee for the Day Care of Chil-
dren has all kinds of material designed to 
help you do just that. They'll provide you 
with sheafs of facts and figures, and the 
reasons why. 
They also sent us a book of standards 
drawn up by the Child Welfare League de-
scribing precisely what good day-care service 
should include. It goes into everything. 
Food, staff, even lists necessary toys and play 
equipment. 
It is only some 8 pages long, but it is a re-
markable handbook that copes with the me-
chanics and philosophy of this business. 
"Day-care service," it says, "is designed to 
protect children by providing part-time care 
and guidance, when their families are unable 
to meet their needs without some assistance 
from the community." 
Then it goes on to say, "and to make it 
possible for children to have healthy and 
constructive experiences during the time 
they require such care." 
It seems to me this is a very small invest-
ment, when you consider that in 15 or 20 
years these children will be part of the new 
generation. 
FOREIGN POLICY?TRADE WITH 
RUSSIA, CUBA, RUMANIA, AND 
HUNGARY 
Mr. DOMINICK. Mr. President, I 
wish to dliscusai subject which I be-
lieve to be of extreme importance both 
to the Senate, as a body, and to the en-
tire country. 
Last November, shortly after the trag-
gic death of President Kennedy, we in 
the Senate had before us, for debate 
and vote, Senate bill 2310, initiated by 
the Senator from South Dakota [Mr. 
MUNDT] and which I had the privilege 
of cosponsoring. That bill was to pro-
hibit any guarantee by the Expert-Im-
port Bank or any other agency of our 
Government of payment of obligations 
of Communist countries. 
All Senators wlio were present on that 
oceaMorr will recall the discussion on the 
floor and the agreement to have short 
hearings held before the Banking and 
Currency Committee, with a definite 
date set, by which the bill would be re-
ported to the Senate. Not all Sena-
tors had a chance to attend the hear-
ings; and because of the short time in-
terval, practically no one had a chance 
to review the hearings record. 
Shortly after the bill was reported to 
the Senate by a divided vote in the com-
mittee, debate ensued; and, with strong 
administration pressures, the bill was 
passed by an extremely close vote. 
Mr. President, the bill was passed more 
as a memorial to the late President Ken-
nedy and as a reaffirmation of faith in 
President Johnson than as a carefully 
considered and logical policy. The ob-
vious dangers, I believe, were glossed over 
or were wholly ignored; but the results of 
those policies are now coming home to 
roost.

12004 Approved Fiar,ReInsAM5All/1A-RDP6613g1403R000200170057-8 
KD ? SENA fE June 2 
Let me give an example: Ever since 
our Government broke diplomatic rela-
tions with Cuba, our country has been 
4 engaged in a national effort to impose 
on Cuba an economic quarantine; and 
our Government has also been doing its 
best to persuade our allies and other 
countries to refrain from trade with 
Cuba, so that Cuba's Communist govern-
ment might be more readily deposed by 
the Cuban people. The need for this has 
been stated on this floor again and again 
and again. I have made more than five 
speeches in which I outlined for the Sen-
ate the continuing dangers to this hemi-
sphere originating from this Communist 
base; and only 10 days ago I pointed out, 
here on the floor of the Senate, that in-
formation publicly available states that 
the Cubans are in possession of under-
water missiles with a 1,200-nautical-mile 
range?missiles designated as the Golan 
/I. These missiles, if in existence, have 
a range sufficient to enable their use to 
decimate the entire eastern half of the 
United States; and they are not subject 
to inspection or discovery by aerial sur-
veillance, for they operate from the floor 
of the ocean, and are movable by subma-
rines or trawlers. We all know from 
news media of the operations of the Rus-
sian trawler fleet off Florida and the for-
ays of the Russian submarines off of our 
coast. Keeping in mind our national 
policy of cutting off trade with Cuba?
and we have added to that the thought 
that we should try to prevent Cuba from 
exporting subversion, which obviously we 
have not succeeded in doing?what hap-
pened when we rejected the bill intro-
duced by the Senator from South Da-
kota (Mr. MUNDT] and agreed to sell 
wheat to Russia on a credit basis, sup-
ported by the credit of the Export-Im-
port Bank, the capital of which is derived 
from the U.S. taxpayers? 
The very first thing that happened was 
the diversion from Halifax of a ship 
loaded with Canadian wheat initially 
bound for the Soviet Union. Instead, it 
was sent to Cuba. This, in turn, wai 
followed almost immediately by British 
agreements to sell buses to Cuba, thus 
Increasing Cuban traipportation capa-
bilities; French agreements to sell trucks, 
bulldozers, and locomotives, thus in-
creasing not only transportation facili-
ties but general industrial strength; and 
Spain's agreement to sell fishing vessels 
to a host of other countries, including 
Portugal and Italy, negotiating to supply 
Communist Cuba with the necessary 
facets of a modern economy. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed at this point in the 
RECORD an article from the Christian 
Science Monitor dated January 30, 1964, 
detailing some of the negotiations then 
going on between other countries and 
Cuba. Keep in mind that this was only 
some 60 days after we had originally 
denied the validity of the bill introduced 
by the Senator from South Dakota [Mr. 
Mmorl and had embarked on the policy 
of trading with, Russia. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
CUBA ELUDES BOYCOTT 
(Trade between Cuba and the non-Com-
munist world is continuing?and in some 
cases even increasing?despite U.S. efforts to 
prevent it. This is the principal finding of 
correspondents of the Christian Science Mon-
itor in various countries asked to report on 
trade between Cuba and their areas. As the 
following dispatches indicate, most countries 
observe the American ban on strategic ex-
ports to Cuba, but few discourage nonstra-
tegic trade.) 
BRITAIN 
(By John Beaufort) 
Britain's position on Cuban trade is that 
the United Kingdom maintains the same 
peaceful diplomatic and commercial relations 
with the Castro regime as with previous Cu-
ban Governments. 
Britain has, however, voluntarily applied 
to Cuba the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion Cocom list. (This list enumerates stra-
tegic goods and materials which NATO cowl-
tries agree not to export to the Communist 
bloc.) 
These restrictions apart, Whitehall sees no 
military, political, economic, or ideological 
reason for curbing normal trade with Cuba. 
London does not feel compelled to modify 
its commercial policies to meet Washington's 
apprehension that any trade strengthens 
Premier Fidel Castro's ability (a) to remain 
in power and (b) to export Castroism to 
Latin America. 
The British rather take the line expressed 
by Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home in 
his recent U.S. television interview that peo-
ple become "less Communist when they are 
more comfortable." The Labor oppoeition 
agrees with the Conservative government on 
this line. 
FRANCE 
(By Harry B. Ellis) 
Three facts dominate the French Govern-
ment's attitude toward trade with Cuba: 
I. France never has sold to Premier Cas-
tro's Cuba on credit, only for cash. 
2, The Cuban Government recently opened 
In Paris a permanent trade mission and 
wants to buy French trucks, bulldozers, and 
other heavy equipment. Reportedly the Cu-
bans-are seeking $10 million worth of French 
credits to finance such deals. 
3. Businessmen In the hard-hit, heavy-
equipment sector of the French economy 
would like to boost their exports?and so 
would the French Government. 
From this melange emerges the following: 
France, busy cultivating trade opportunities 
throughout the Communist world, has no 
moral objection to nonstrategic trade with 
Cuba. Deals will be consummated if Paris 
becomes convinced Cuba is a sound credit 
risk. 
This is apart from sales for cash. which 
will continue. In the first 6 months of 1963 
France bold Cuba $2.340,000 worth of goods 
and bought $1.500,000 worth in return., 
CANADA 
(By Bruce Hutchison) 
Apart from strategic goods Canada will sell 
anything to Ctita but it is not selling much. 
Last year's sales amounted to about 44 mil-
lion, the smallest figure in modern times. 
All exports to Cuba are controlled by strict 
regulations that apply only to it and other 
Communist countries. 
The government's first "control list" in-
crudes all forms of military armaments and 
their components. None of these things may 
be shipped to Cuba. 
A second list specifies goods produced in 
the United States and shipped to Canada. 
None of them may be exported to Cuba. 
These regulations implement Canada's view 
that trade with Communist countries M gen-
wally desirable provided it does :Int con-
tribute to their strategic strength. 
NORTH AFRICA 
(By John K. Cooley) 
Ideology yields to necessity in North Africa 
where about 27 million people use sugar com-
ing largely from Cuba as a basic food and 
where governments are striving to escape 
from economic dependence &a the former 
colonial power, France. 
Morocco. Algeria, and Tunisia are all buy-
ing more raw Cuban sugar and selling to 
Cuba about half its value in phosphates, 
cement, pipe, canned sardines, grains, and 
cork products. 
Of the North African counties only So-
cialist Algeria. which has the closest and 
friendliest relations with Havana, evokes 
ideology In what President Ben Bella has 
called "an economic policy conforming to our 
Socialist choice." 
Anti-Communist Morocco has agreed to 
purchase I millions tons of raw Cuban sugar 
by the end of 1965, The prices Cuba offered 
Morocco have been as much as 30 percent 
below those ruling on the world market. 
During the recent brief diplomatic rupture 
with Cuba, Moroccan officials expressed ap-
prehension because no other major world 
sugar Source Is presently available to this 
country.' 
Cuba is second only to France as a cus-
tomer for North African canned fish which is 
increasingly hard to sell In competitive Euro-
pean markets. 
WEST GERMANY 
(By Ernest S. Piako) ? 
Bonn's policy toward Fidel Castro's Cuba 
largely parallels that of the United States. 
The West German Federal Republic has no 
diplomatic relations with Cuba; nor has it a 
trade tqlat y with it. 
There is no ban on private trade with Com-
munist countries?except for strategic 
goods?but according to available earidence, 
the total of West German exports to and 
imports from Cuba appears to be very small. 
According to a Voluntary agreement be-
tween the Bonn Government and the West 
German shipping lines, West German vessels 
will keep out of Cuban waters, The charter-
ing of West German ships to sail under 
Cuban flags has been prohibited. 
ITALY 
(By Walter Lucas) 
The Italian Government has adopted no 
special policy regarding Italians trading with 
Cuba. In practice, mutual trade between 
Italy and Cuba is carried on freely on ordi-
nary commercial lines. 
Permission for an export license from the 
government is only necessary on exports in-
volving long-term credits in which normal 
banking finance Is backed up by govern-
ment insurance. In such cases an applica-
tion for an export license would be approved 
on its merits. 
The decision is generally made on commer-
cial, not political grounds. Since, however, 
the financial position in Cuba does not favor 
long-term credit operation, few licenses are 
given. 
In any case Italo-Cuban trade is small. In . 
1962 It amounted to only $1.7 million both 
ways. This increased to $36 million both 
ways In the first 9 months of 1963. Almost 
the whole of this great increase was due to 
large purchases of sugar after the failure of 
the Italian sugar beet crop. 
A certain number of Italian ships on long-
term charter contracts with the Soviet Union 
and Poland make regular tripe to Cuba. 
Over these the Italian Government has no 
control.

should like to outline for the Senate as 
a whole and for the country some of the 
statements which Dr. Nutter made at 
the hearing They appear on page 68 
of the hearing record. lie said: 
As I understand it, the basic issue before 
this committee has to do with the advisabil-
ity of making the credit insurance program 
of the Export-Import Bank available for 
underwriting private loans advanced to Com-
munist countries to finance their purchases 
of products in this country. To place this 
issue in a concrete setting, it seems reason-
able to begin by examining the matter of our 
recent wheat sales to Communist countries 
and how such an underwriting of credit risk 
would affect them. As I understand it, the 
bill under consideration arose out of circum-
stances surrounding these transactions. r 
think it will be clear that the main line of 
argument would apply to any comm&lity 
other than wheat that might play a similar 
role in the future. 
Dr. Nutter then continued on page 69 
of the hearing record: 
The troubles being encountered by the 
Soviet leaders are of their own making, and 
they should find their own solutions. It is 
idle to believe that any assistance we offer 
will be rewarded with gratitude. Kindness 
on our part will be taken merely as a sign 
of weakness, the action of a degenerate ad-
versary contributing to his own destruction. 
? The fOrm our response should take is clear. 
If we decide that a one-shot sale of wheat to 
the Soviet Union would bring us any im-
portant lasting benefit---which, incidentally, 
is riot evident to me?then we should drive 
the hardest bargain possible in making the 
It is important to point out that these 
benefits would accrue to us whether our grain 
is sold by us directly to Communist countries 
or indirectly through other countries. That 
is to say, there is no substance to the argu-
ment that we should sell directly to the 
Communist countries because, if we don't 
they will simply buy the same commodities 
from some dealer, say, a German firm, who 
has bought them from us. If we sell the 
goods indirectly, so the argument goes, we 
merely let some other country, say, Germany, 
make a profit in Rating as intermediary. 
Hence, the argument concludes, we should 
be willing to make some concessions to the 
Communist countries in order to make a di-
rect sale. 
The entire argument is, of course, fal-
lacious. 
Professor Nutter continued: 
Only if the sales are made on credit does 
the American balance of payments have no 
improvement for as long as the credit is 
outstanding. 
The moral is simple: If we decide to make 
wheat available directly or indirectly to Com-
munist countries, we should sell ip at the 
highest cash price we can get, regardless of 
, who the immediate buyer is. Our best 
chance of driving a hard bargain is to deal 
directly with the Communist countries on 
an all-or-none basis, provided we can control 
the volume of indirect sales. In any event, 
there is no sense whatsoever in setting favor-
able terms just in order to make a direct sale. 
Granting special concessions to the Com-

STATEMENT OP G. WARREN NIIITER, CHAIR-
MAN, SAM= WILSON DEPARTMENT OF EGO-
NOMIgl, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA 
_Dr. Norma. Thank you very much, 
Mr. Chairman and members of the com-
mittee, it is an honor to appear before this 
committee to offer my opinions on the im-
portant matters now being deliberated. So 
that the committee will not be misled, let me 
make it clear that my claim to competence 
in discussing the issues before you is a 
limited one. I am not an expert on Inter-
national trade and finance. And, although 
/ have spent a number of years doing re-
search on the Soviet economy, this work has 
been done in an academic environment, 
which means that I normally consider my-
self fortunate if I have managed to catch _up 
with happenings of 5 years ago. I have tried 
in recent months to become better ac-
quainted with the current economic situa-
tion in Communist countries, but I would 
not claim expert knowledge. What I have to 
say this morning derives, therefore, more 
from my broad views on the trend of events 
over the 'rot 'decade than from detailed 
knowledge of present conditions. 
As I understand it. the basic issue before 
this committee has to do with the advis-
ability of making the credit insurance pro-
gram of the Export-Import Bank available 
for underwriting private loans advanced to 
Communist countries to finance their pur-
chases of products in this country. To place 
this issue in a concrete setting, it seems 
reasonable to begin by examining the matter 
of our recent _wheat sales to Communist 
countries and how such an underwriting of 
credit risk would affect them. As I under-
stand it. the bill under consideration arose 
out of circumstances surrounding these 
transactions. I think it will be clear that 
the main line of argument would apply to 
any commodity other than wheat that might 
play a similar role in the future. 
The Soviet Union, as we all know, has 
historically been an exporter of wheat, not 
an importer. This has been the case despite 
the generally poor record of growth in agri-
culture, because Soviet authorities have pre-
ferred other products over food. Over the 4 
years, 19441, Soviet exports of wheat 
amounted to more than a tenth of the har-
vested crop, but annual exports; declined 
from about 7 million metric tons in 1958 
and 6 million metric tons in 1959 to 4.8 mil-
lion metric tons in 1961. Although I do not 
have the figures at hand. I should imagine 
that exports were even lower in 1962. Even 
expo -Gs of this level have hung precariously 
on successful production in substantial vol-
ume from the virgin lands in south-central 
Asia, pleiwed up and put to seed over the 
last decade. 
This year there was a serious crop failure 
of a magnitude yet to be accurately deter-
mined, but apparently primarily In the virgin 
lands region. As a result, the Soviet Union 
has already agreed to purchase about 6.5 
million metric tons from Canada and is 
negotiating with firms In this country for 
perhaps 4 million metric tons. Enropean 
satellites are apparently negotiating for an 
additional 2.5 million metric tons. How 
much of this Bum is destined for internal 
consumption in the Soviet Union and how 
much for fulfillment of export obligations, 
Including those to its European satellites, is 
still in doubt. But the fact remains that the 
Soviet purchases alone amount to around a 
fifth of the Soviet crop of the last few years, 
and this suggests that the crop failure was 
quite substantial, 
As we deliberate over how we should act 
in the situation that has developed, the first 
question we should face is whether Soviet 
Imports of wheat are likely to be only tem-
porary or whether they are likely to become 
a normal occurrence over the indefinite 
future. 
If the situation is temporary?if the crop 
failure this; year has been caused by extra-
ordinary events not likely to recur?then we 
should view the wheat shortage as just an-
other 'editor causing severe economic diffi-
culties at the moment In the Soviet Union. 
These difficulties have resulted from the 
concurrence of several developments: a nor-
mal slowing down in the economic growth 
rate, the inefficiency of the organizational 
system in dealing with an increasingly com-
plex economy, and the heavy burden of the 
military-space program. 
If this is the situation, how should we 
respond to it? The troubles being encount-
ered by the Soviet leaders are of their own 
making, and they should End their own so-
lutions. It is idle to believe that any assist-
ance we offer will be rewarded with grati-
tude. Kindness on our part will be taken 
merely as a sign of weakness, the action of 
a degenerate adversary contributing to his 
own destruction. 
The form our response should take is clear. 
If we decide that a one-shot gale of wheat 
to the Soviet Union would bring us any Im-
portant lasting benefit?which, incidentally, 
Is not evident to me?then we should drive 
the hardest bargain possible in making the 
sale, preferably exacting poltical concessions. 
We should lay here the utter hyprocriey in 
the indignant protests of Ehrushchev against 
"discriminatory pricing." It is in the very 
nature of the Soviet system to exploit each 
trading partner as much as possible. Uni-
form, nondiscriminatory prices play no role 
In Soviet trade except for the relatively email 
purchases from the United States and a few 
other countries. The great bulk of trade is 
conducted on a bilateral, discriminatory 
basis In dealing with such a system, we 
only harm ourselves in not charging the 
highest price possible. If we decide to sell 
wheat to the Reaaiana, let us sell it on our 
own terms, on an all-or-none basis. They 
are then free to take It or leave it. as other 
countries normally are in dealing with the 
Russians. 
So much for the situation if it is simply 
a temporary emergency. Suppose, on the 
other hand, that Soviet imports of wheat 
are likely to be a regular event in the future. 
This is by no means out of the question, for 
there is a real possibility that the virgin 
lands have been turned into an unproduc-
tive dust bowl for some time to come. How, 
then, should our attitude differ? In this 
ease we might well be more lenient in the 
terms of sale that we exacted at the moment, 
only on the condition, however, that a defi-
nite commitment were made for continuing 
purchases over a reasonably long period of 
time. Before reaching a decision on what 
to do in this case, we should need to re-
examine our entire trading policy toward 
the Soviet bloc and let our decision on the 
sale of wheat derive from that general 
decision., 
In neither case should we rush into agree-
ments, and our actions should be guided 
solely by cold considerations of what is in 
our best Interest. We have no solid ground 
for believing that the nature and objectives 
of Soviet corcununism have changed in any 
significant degree in recent times. Only the 
problems facing that system have changed, 
and with them the tactics followed. 
One might well wonder whether this cen-
tral fact has not been forgotten by the ad-
ministration. The admiqlstration has rushed 
Into an agreement on the sale of wheat. It 
has seemingly leaned over backward to make 
sure the terms were not too harsh. /t has 
responded to every objection raised by the 
Soviet leaders against proposed terms by 
denying that we were imposing conditions 
in any way different from those imposed on 
others. It has essentially put on kid gloves 
to make sure that it treated Soviet negotia-
tors with special tenderness, for fear that the 
sale otherwise might not go through. In 
brief, an outsider would be justified in con-
cluding that, for some reason unknown to 
him, the primary beneficiary of this transac-
tion is supposed to be the United States. 
I speak, of course, as an outsider, unaware 
of the host of factors being weighed by the 
administration in negotiating this commer-
cial transaction with Communist countries. 
Perhaps there are impelling reasons why the 
administration is anxious to conclude an 
agreement with the Soviet Union and its 
satellites on terms less faekarable than could 
be achieved through tougher and more pro-
tracted bargaining. But those reasons re-
main unexplained and therefore beyond, the 
realm of discussion. 
It is true that the public has been informed 
of two benefits to this country from this sale 
of grain. First, our surplus stocks of grain, 
accumulated as a result of the policy of 
subsidizing agricultural production through 
price supports would be reduced. Second, 
the deficit In our current international bal-
ance of payments would be reduced. 
It is important to point out that these 
benefits would accrue to us whether our 
grain is sold by us directly to Communist 
countries or indirectly through other coun-
tries. That is to say, there is no substance to 
the argument that we should sell directly to 
the Communist countries, because, If we 
don't, they will simply buy the same com-
modities from some dealer, say, a German 
firm, who has bought them from us. If we 
sell the goods indirectly, so the argument 
goes, we merely let some other country, say, 
Germany. make a profit in acting as interme-
diary. Hence, the argument concludes, we 
should be willing to make some concessions 
to the Communist countries in order to make 
a direct sale. 
The entire argument is, of course, falla-
cious. The only matters of Importance are 
whether we sell the wheat in the first place, 
and how much we get for it in the second 
place. It does not matter who buys the 
wheat so far as the central Issue here is con-
cerned, as long as no additional goods are 
imported into this country or no credit is ex-
tended by our citizens in connection with the 
sale. 
If we can sell to a German firm at an ac-
ceptable price. it would be folly to sell direct-
ly to the Communist country of ultimate des-
tination at a reduced price just to make a 
direct sale. On this score, it also makes no 
difference whether the payment Is In gold or 
convertible currency. The effect -on sales of 
surplus stocks and on the balance of pay-
ments is identical in both cases. Only if the 
sales are made on credit does the American 
balance of payments have no improvement 
for as long as the credit is outstanding. 
The moral is simple: If we decide to make 
wheat available directly or indirectly to Com-
munist countries, we should sell it at the 
highest cash price we can get, regardless of 
who the immediate buyer is. Our best 
chance of driving a hard bargain Is to deal 
directly with the Communist countries on an 
all-or-none basis, provided we can control 
the volume of indirect sales. In any event, 
there is no sense whatsoever in setting favor-
able terms just in order to make a direct 
sale. 
Granting special concessions to the Com-
munist countries would Indeed be sadly 
Ironic. We have given foreign aid to 
various countries In order to inhibit the 
spread of communism. This foreign aid has_

would then iorOPoge tO-cOrracttliat 'deficit by

This brings me to the question before the

The CHAIRMAN. All right, you may proceed. 
Senator JAvrrs. I know them both very 
well, Mr. Chairman, and I am very glad to 
introduce the witness to the committee. 
Mr. STEIBEL. This is a challenge, Senator, 
to see whether I can convert you. 
Mr. DOMINICK. Mr. President, every 
time we have protested to our friends 
and allies about trading with Cuba, 
we have been answered with the ir-
refutable logic, "Why should we cut off 
trade with a satellite of Russia?Cuba?
when you are trading directly with Rus-
sia?" 
As a side issue, I suggest that to trade 
with Russia has enabled it to shift its 
concentration from its own internal eco-
nomic problems and has freed it even 
more to arm and supply its own satellites. 
In December, 1963, I received a report 
from Cuba which reads, as follows?and 
I think this may be of interest to the 
entire Senate: 
Elias Rivero Bello, a communications chief 
for Cuba's state-controlled merchant traffic, 
Lineas Mambises, states that Red Chinese 
commercial trade with Cuba is on the rise 
with Russian shipping diverted to military 
cargoes. Although Red China has only two 
ships in direct trade with Cuba, its prod-
ucts are reaching Havana in ships of British 
registry manned by crews from Hong Kong. 
The two Red Chinese ships are Shien Foon 
and Ho Fun. The British-chartered ships 
most often plying the China-Cuba route are 
identified by Rivero Bello as the Macao, East 
Breeze, West Breeze, and the Suva Breeze. 
Rivero Bello was in charge of the teleprint-
ers which handled clearance messages for all 
ship traffic to and from Cuba. He fled Cuba 
the end of November of this year (1963). 
It seems obvious to me, from reading 
these reports, and from the overall re-
sults we have had up to date in connec-
tion with trade with Cuba immediately 
after our wheat sales to Russia, that we 
have created a far more dangerous con-
dition than previously existed by virtue 
of the fallacy in our foreign policy with 
respect to trade with Communist Cuba. 
In that same article is a brief state-
ment which reads: 
There is the suspicion that the Russians 
are again introducing strategic weapons into 
Cuba. 
Again I point out that he was the one 
Who was in charge of taking all messages 
for shipping in and out of Cuba?
The "special cargoes," states Rivero Bello, 
"are unloaded in the greatest secrecy, and 
not even the Cuban Communists are per-
mitted near them. All are unloaded, trans-
ported, and stored by Soviet personnel." 
This is one more indicator, it seems to 
me, of the point I just made, with re-
200170057-8 
12007 
spect-tO-the fact that there are reliable 
reports that there are 1,200-mile missiles 
now in Cuba which could decimate the 
entire eastern coast of this country. 
Going further, in the April 13, 1964, is-
sue of U.S. News & World Report there 
appears the viewpoint of Prof. G. War-
ren Nutter, who is the James Wilson 
professor of economics at the University 
of Virginia, and a recognized authority 
in connection with the Soviet economy. 
He was discussing, publicly and in the 
magazine, the Soviet economy and the 
advisability of our trading with her, 
much less guaranteeing credit for such 
sales. There are a couple of items in the 
article which I wish to emphasize. 
The question asked was: Should we 
help the Soviets try to adjust? 
His answer to the question was: 
It is a difficult problem. It's not easy to 
know exactly what we ought to do. I think 
it's a little easier to know what we ought not 
to do. 
I don't think we should help them out of 
their current economic difficulties without, at 
the same time, getting some change in either 
the political climate or their internal sys-
tem. That much, I think, we ought to do. 
We have to take advantage of these periods 
of weakness if we're going to get any changes 
started. 
Question. Under those terms, was the 
wheat deal a mistake? 
Answer. The way in which it was done 
was a mistake. We should have bargained. 
I think that their internal problems are 
really quite serious, very serious. Their 
problems in relations with the East Euro-
pean satellites are serious and becoming 
more and more aggravated all the time. In 
addition, they've got the problem of China 
and the whole splitting of the Communist 
bloc. 
Once again he says, in answer to the 
same question: 
Are you saying that as long as we bail them 
out nothing will happen? 
The questioner is talking about bail-
ing out the problems of the Soviet econ-
omy. 
Answer. That's right. If we bail them out, 
they will use the time at their disposal to 
retrench, to build up their power and to 
somehow manage the difficulties that they're 
involved in. They'll find some way. 
Question. If the Russians can drum up 
support from capitalism to make socialism 
work, do you think they're going to change 
socialism? 
Answer. They won't. That's quite unlike-
ly. That would be their own business and 
nobody else's if it weren't for the aggressive-
ness, belligerence, and expansionism that go 
along with Russian communism. 
The next few points are very impor-
tant in the general context: 
I'm afraid that our foreign policy is sheer 
romanticism, without any real logic in-
volved in it. Our Government shies away 
from anything which carries any immediate 
risk at all, no matter how small, and then 
rationalizes whatever course is left, even 
though the ultimate risk is much greater. 
In cold reality, this leads to nothing more 
than a policy of appeasement, and I mean 
this in the literal sense associated with 
Neville Chamberlain. We know from dread-
ful experience what appeasement leads to. 
The course being followed now is to be 
nice and to be friendly, because it seems 
least risky at the immediate moment. This 
Is rationalized on the ground that fat Com-
munists are less dangerous than skinny ones.

This may be true, If one is looking at a very 
long sweep of history. Over a thousand 
years or so, perhaps people will become more 
liberal solely because they become more af-
fluent. 
But if one's talking about what happens in 
the immediate context of a system such as 
Russia's, then exactly the reverse occurs: As 
won as they become fat?or, rather, fatter?
they get more belligerent and aggressive. 
What is the history of events in Russia? 
As soon as Khnishchev thought he was fat 
enough, be sent up a sputnik. He went all 
out on rocketry and introduced a massive 
armament program. That was his re-
sponse?not relaxation. 
When did the relaxation come? It came 
when they got thinner. My feeling Is that. 
at the moment, our best allies are the thin 
fellows, not the fat ones. Those are the ones 
we have the most to gain from. 
Question. Who are they? 
Answer. They're all the people In these 
Iron Curtain countries who have gotten thin-
ner in the last few years, 
Who are they mad at? They're not mad at 
us. Who are they dissatisfied with? They're 
not dissatisfied with us. They're dissatisfied 
with their system, and they're mad at their 
governments. 
It seems to me this is the kind of situation 
we want to try to utilize the best we can. I 
think we ought to put it up to them to work 
out their own way to get fatter while leav-
ing the outside world alone. 
There's a perfectly good solution to their 
problems, a perfectly simple solution?and 
that's to change the system. 
It seems to me, as I have said, that this 
is a clear recognition of the problems 
that our policy is leading us into, not 
only the longrun troubles we are going 
to have with a Communist economy, but 
perhaps even some shorter term ones. 
There have been reliable indications 
that a process has been developed by a 
Russian?I do not know how to pro-
nounce the name of it, but it is spelled 
L-e-b-e-d-j-i-w--under which the So-
viet Union can produce a ton of indus-
trial ethyl alcohol from 8 tons of wheat. 
Under a 7-year plan, the Soviets plan 
to produce 800,000 tons of this alcohol 
from foodstuffs. This would require 6.4 
million tons of cereal grains, which is 
more than accounted for in their deal 
with Canada alone, not counting the 
amount of wheat they entered into a 
Contract to purchase from this country. 
It certainly does not make any sense 
to me when this kind of a process is 
presently in existence in Rnsaia for the 
United States to sell surplus wheat on 
credit?which is not going to help our 
international balance of payments?
which will permit them to male ethyl 
alcohol, which in turn can be used for 
the production of armaments and ex-
plosives of all kinds. This is one of the 
Immediate dangers, it seems to me, that 
can come from the program. 
What are the things that have been 
happening in this trade field and the 
problems that have arisen from it? Let 
Me talk about one that has recently come 
to light. The April 27, 1964, issue of the 
Washington Evening Star contained an 
article by Marguerite Higgins which re-
ported an oil strike in Manchuria of a 
substantial nature. 
Mats is a Red Chinese oil strike. Until 
this time, the Chinese had been almost 
ComPletely and wholly dependent upon 
Russia TOT oil, for transportation, for 
heating, and for any other uses that they 
could rind for it. I think this is impor-
tant. The article reads as follows: 
The U.S. intelligence community is con-
vinced It has discovered an important reason 
why Peiping has greked the last year and a 
half to let loose with increasing ferocity 
against the Russians: A Red Chinese oil 
strike in Manchuria. 
According to reports reaching here, the 
strike is of such size that it could make China 
self-sufficient In petroleum products. 
Oil has constituted the chain of black gold 
that for more than a decade made Peiping 
slavishly dependent on its relations with 
Moscow. Until recently. Moscow has fur-
nished virtually all of China's oil. The peak 
was reached in 1981 when Peiping bought 
?28 billion worth of oil and aviation fuel 
from Russia_ 
It continues, and because / think it is 
Important, I ask unanimous consent that 
the entire article by Marguerite Higgins 
be printed at this point in the REcoltn. 
The PRESIDING OFFICztt. (Mr. 
BREWsTslt in the chair.) Is there objec-
tion? 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
!Prom the Washington Evening Star, 
Apr. 27, 1964] 
INTICIPRITIVIL REPORT: Panntro COCKY AT 
On. Smoot 
(My Marguerite Higgins) 
The 17 S. intelligence community is con-
vinced it has discovered an important reason 
why Peiping has picked the last year and a 
half to let loose with increasing ferocity 
against the Russians: A Red Chinese oil 
strike in Manchuria. 
According to reports reaching here, the 
strike is of such size that it could make 
China self-sufficient in petroleum products. 
Oil has constituted the chain of black gold 
that for more than a decade made Peiping 
slavishly dependent on its relations with 
Moscow. Until recently. Moscow has fur-
nished virtually all of China's oil. The peak 
was reached in 1961 when Peiping bought $2.8 
billion worth of oil and aviation fuel from 
Russia. 
It Is of significance that In the days when 
the Sino-Soviet split was still a matter of 
conjecture, the experts who argued against 
the likelihood of a complete rupture invari-
ably cited Peiping's dependence on Moscow 
for oil as a reason why Mao Tse-tung would 
hesitate to make a total break. 
Quite apart from giving Peiping greater po-
tential independence and therefore greater 
license to thumb its nose at Moscow, the oil 
strike will have an enormous impact on Red 
China's economic destiny. 
The exact date of the Manchurian discov-
ery is not known. But the first reports of it 
began to filter to the West about 18 months 
ago. 
The most solid information has come in 
the last few weeks from Japanese engineers 
and businessmen engaged by the Chinese to 
help in the drilling and in building all re-
fineries. It is the Japanese who are the 
source of the estimate that the oil resources 
discovered in Manchuria may be large enough 
to make China self-sufficient. 
There is an irony in this because the Japa-
nese, In all the years that they occupied Man-
churia, never were able to discover oil, even 
though they did extensive exploring. 
The Manchurian find helps explain the in-
crease in petroleum experts from Prance, 
Britain and West Germany who have been 
traveling to Red China via Hong Kong in 
recent months. 
There is a good case to be made that Red 
Chinese stridency against Moscow has In-
- June 2 
creased in almost direct proportion to Pelp-
Ing's confidence in the fact that its de-
pendence on Moscow for oil would end. 011 
sennerlea are not of course built In a day. 
But It apparently has been pretty heady 
for the Chinese leaders to possess the knowl-
edge that it is only a matter of time until 
the Chinese Army will no longer be vulner-
able to the threat of being immobilized by 
a Kremlin decision to cut off oil exports. 
It is not just the Western intelligence com-
munity that sees a close connection between 
the oil discovery and Peiping challenging 
stand against Moscow. 
A spot check of Eastern European em-
bassies showed that Communist diplomats 
were aware of the developments in Man-
churia and its impact on the Sino-Soviet 
split. 
Said one Eastern European: "In private 
talks in Peiping with our officials, the Chinese 
make no attempt to hide their exhilaration 
over their economic liberation from Moscow 
that will come as the result of the develop-
ment of their own oil. 
"All of us have noted that the Red Chinese 
waited until they were quite sure of their 
oil potential before they took the risk of a 
complete break with the Russians by attack-
ing them so violently. They have become 
increasingly cocky about their future. 
"The Chinese seems to feel that no matter 
how many mistakes they make, destiny Is on 
their side, and therefore the east wind will 
prevail over the west." 
Mr. DOMINICIC. Mr. President, it 
seems to me that there are two important 
points in this connection. The first is 
that if China actually has found the oil 
to the extent mentioned?and all the 
Information leads us to believe that it 
has?it is then free, as far as oil is con-
cerned, to continue its more aggressive 
campaigns throughout Asia in order to 
put the other Asian countries under 
communism. The second point, and it is 
equally important, is that if China is 
freed from purchasing oil from Russia, 
so, too, is Russia free from the obligation 
of sending oil to one of its chief Com-
munist allies, thereby giving it far more 
ability to use its oil supplies to increase 
Its own industrial capacity within its 
own country. 
This leaves, then, only two major 
points. The first is that this is one of 
the remaining weaknesses in the Rus-
sian economy. The second is that the 
oil strike in China can be used by virtue 
of having the proper type of industrial 
equipment for refining. 
The other day I was consulted by a 
very prominent person in one of the for-
eign embassies here in Washington. I 
was asked, with regard to the latter ques-
tion I mentioned, to look at the Par East 
Trade and Development magazine for 
April 1964?at the same time the article 
on the oil strike was published. It reads 
as follows: 
larousraud, EQUIPMENT ros Canis 
Snam-Projetti. of Milan, a member of the 
EN/ group, has won a Chinese contract for 
a complete petroleum refinery, worth Elm. 
Work is to be completed by 1968. This is one 
of several large orders placed with Italian 
firms recently. Last December the Chinese 
signed three contracts for chemical equip-
ment worth about Elem., and Montecatini 
Is shipping E7m. worth of machinery for 
two fertilizer factories with a combined out-
put of 800,000 tons. The plants will prob-
ably be built near Luchow in Szechuall 
Province, where natural gas is plentiful.

Once again we are faced with a situ-
ation in which a free world, which is 
doing its best to take the leadership in a 
fight to dive self-determination rights to 
all countries, by virtue of trade with the 
ComMunist countries is increasing their 
economy Onci bolstering the economies 
wherever they are the Weakest. The 
U.S. public is being told that this is nec-
essary because of a deficit in inter-
national payments, when we are doing it 
on credit. It does not make sense. 
Just yesterday, I understand, the For-
eign Relations Connnittee was informed 
about the agreement with Rumania, the 
agreement apparently having been 
signed, as far as trade is concerned, 
without benefit of consultation with the 
House of Representatives or the Senate, 
and without the advance knowledge of 
the House of Representatives or the 
Senate, or the advance opportunity of 
the House of Representatives or the 
Senate to do anything about it. 
'in this morning's Wall Street Journal, 
there is a very small comment on this 
sub,ject which reads as? follows: 
. 
ports to Rumania Of most goods will be 
allowed without individual licenses. 
The United States clung to its refusal to 
sell strategic materials to any Communist 
bloc nation, but extended to Rumania trade 
terms thsp are among the most liberal Of 
those offered any Soviet Satellite.- The two 
cOuntrieo als6 agreed to raise the level of 
diplomatic representation from legations to 
embassies arid exchange of ambassadors "at 
an early date." 
Its understood the Johnson administra-
tipn. is prepared to make available to Ru-
mania the facilities- of the Government's 
Export-Import tank' to furnish credit guar-
antees of 14p to 5 years on Some of the in-
creased sales expected toresult from the 
agreement. 
, 
So here we are, full circle, back 'again 
into the November situation. We saY 
to our allies, "Please do not trade with 
tuba." We say this because if we can 
give them an economic quarantine, we 
can to reduce their economjp, slrength 
that the Cubans themselves will have an 
opportunity to upset their government. 
On the other hand, we proceed to do ex-
actly the same thing, giving trade and 
dealt to the head of the overall con-
spiracy, Rnssia, and then giving it to 
one of its most praline/it satellites, 
Ru-
ntaia, which is still governed by Mr. 
Kadar, Mr. Radar having been One of 
,the greatest- Communist butchers that 
the Soviet, satellites ,eye.T had. 
There is, an article dated today in the 
Wall Street Journal entitled: "United 
States, Rumania_ Sign Trade,. Political 
Pik* Move May Loosen Satellite's So-
viet Ties." It reads in cart as follows: 
TY.a, officials` declined to eiaborste, but the 
Runinalans have been known to be In the 
market for whole petrochemical plants, as 
well as oil refinery machinery. Talks between 
a Rumanian trade delegation and U.S. Indus-
trialists have been going on during the gov-
ernment-to-government conferences; and 
some transactions already are said to have 
been closed., 
_Nothing official was said about U.S. Gov-
ernrilent credits to help finance such trade, 
but it isUn4erstood the Johnson administra-
tion is prepared to make available the facili-
ties of the Government's Export-Import Bank 
to furnish credit guarantees of up to 5 years. 
President Johnson is required by law to make 
a determination that export-import credits 
to a Communist country are in the national 
interest; he hasn't yet done so, but the pros-
pect is that he will act shortly. 
I want to make it crystal clear for the 
RECORD that any guarantee by the Ex-
port-Import Bank is out of the taxpayers' 
funds for guaranteeing the credit of 
Communist countries. And if we are to 
have a certain policy with respect to one 
country, saying that we are going to cut 
off the economy of that country in order 
to overturn a Communist government, 
what is the purpose of not only trading 
with the head country and its other sat-
ellites in Western Europe, but also using 
our own taxpayers' credit in order to 
make sure that its sales go through, so 
that we can be absolutely positive that 
they are getting credit on the easiest 
possible terms? - 
It is a strange and peculiar type of 
foreign policy for this country to be pur-
suing. Moreover, all satellite countries 
will do exactly what Professor Nutter 
warned they would do, in his article in 
the U.S. News 84 World Report; namely, 
they will interpret this policy as noth-
ing more than a sign of weakness in the 
free world and, over a period of time, 
nothing but appeasement of the Commu-
nist conspiracy, which is worldwide. 
Mr. ALLOTT. Mr. President, will the 
Senator yield? 
Mr. DOMINICK. I yield. 
Mr. ALLOTT. First of all, my distin-
guished colleague from Colorado has 
made a very important contribution to 
the subject, which we have been discuss-
ing for some 6 or 7 months, and which 
was lost sight of when it was originally 
discussed before the Senate. 
Senators will recall that when the Rus-
sian wheat transaction was first pro-
posed to the people of America, it was 
supposed to be a one-shot cash trans-
action. I am sure the Senator remem-
bers that. 
Mr. DOMINICK. .1 certainly do. 
Mr. ALLOTT. Many of us, upon first 
blush, thought that upon those terms it 
might be a favorable deal. Then we 
found that we would start financing the 
deal on a long term?or what I would 
call long term, but which others thought 
was an ordinary term?of up to 4 or 5 
years by way of credits. 
The point the Senator has made, which 
is very important, is that we do not 
change the balance of trade when we 
finance such deals by providing credit. 
The balance of trade is changed only 
when the credit is finally paid off. 
I should like to ask the Senator a ques-
tion with reference particularly to his 
remarks about Rumania. 
We are about to engage on such a deal 
with Rumania. According to the morn-
ing newspapers, we will make the deal on 
the "most favorable terms" to Rumania 
and an other country. This means, first 
of all, that we will not effect any change 
in the trade plan of our country. Does 
it not? 
Mr. DOMINICK. That is correct. 
Mr. ALLOTT. Second, does it not 
mean that when we offer them the "most 
favorable terms," we will ultimately build 
up dollar credits in Rumania; then, go-
ing by the very naive attitude of the State 
12009 
Department and in accordance with what 
Dr. Nutter calls the romantic concept of 
the State Department, we will be called 
upon, when it comes time for Rumania 
to repay those dollars, to grant them 
even more favorable trade terms? That 
means that we will place the workers and 
manufacturers?the producers?in this 
country in an even worse position with 
relation to the people of Rumania. 
Mr. DOMINICK. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the article to 
which I have referred, published in the 
Wall Street Journal, be printed in the 
RECORD at this point. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
[Prom the Wall Street Journal, June 2, 19611 
UNITED STATES, RUMANIA SIGN TRADE, POLITI-
CAL PACT?MOVE MAY LOOSEN SATELLITES' 
SOVIET TIES 
WAsxmarox.?The United States signed 
new economic and political agreements with 
Communist Rumania that are expected to 
spur increased U.S. sales to that Soviet-bloc 
nation and perhaps encourage a general loos-
ening of ties between Russia and her Eastern 
European satellites. 
The tw9 countries 019_ agreed to raise the 
level of diplomatic representation from lega-
tions to embassies and exchange ambassadors 
"at an early date." And agreement was 
reached on an expansion of cultural, educa-
tional, and scientific links. But the big de-
velopments had to do with trade, said U.S. 
officials in announcing a pact reached after 
more than a week of high-level discussions 
here. 
These are the key elements in the agree-
ment: 
The United States, while clinging to its re-
fusal to sell strategic materials to any Soviet-
bloc nation, has agreed to relax export licens-
ing requirements so as to eliminate the need 
for individual licenses on "most commodi-
ties" shipped to Rumania. 
Until this relaxation, generally each ship-
ment to a Communist bloc country has to be 
licensed. With most other countries there 
exists the general authority to export broad 
categories of goods rather than seek licensing 
of each individual shipment. 
The United States agreed specifically to 
grant licenses for what the joint communi-
que called a number of particular industrial 
facilities in which the Rumanian delegation 
expressed special interest. U.S. officials de-
clined to elaborate, but the Rumanians have 
been known to be in the market for whole 
petrochemical plants, as well as oil refinery 
machinery. Talks between a Rumanian 
trade delegation and U.S. industrialists have 
been going on during the government-to-
government conferences, and some transac-
tions already are said to have been closed. 
Nothing official was said about U.S. Gov-
ernment credits to help finance such trade, 
but it is understood the Johnson adminis-
tration is prepared to make available the fa-
cilities of the Government's Export-Import 
Bank to furnish credit guarantees of up to 
5 years. President Johnson is required by law 
to make a determination that Export-Im-
port credits to a Communist country are in 
the national interest; he hasn't yet done so, 
but the prospect is that he will act shortly. 
Without such credits, officials said, the 
prospects for any sizable boost in U.S. sales 
to Rumania are slim. Because the whole 
purpose of the agreement announced yester-
day is to spur such sales, there would have 
been little point to all the fanfare surround-
ing the agreements if the United States 
weren't prepared to allow the bank to guar-
antee normal private credit. 
U.S. sales to Rumania have been averaging 
less than.$2 million annually, and this coun-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD?SENATE 
try's purchases from the Eastern European 
nation have been even skimpier. Yesterday's 
agreement isn't expected to spur the U.S. im-
ports, chiefly because the country has little 
that the United States wants to buy. Spe-
cifically. U.S. authorities firmly ruled out the 
possibility of Rumanian oil entering the U.S. 
market. Although /birnazin is a major on 
exporter to Western Europe, the thinking 
here is that it cannot ship oil economically 
to the United States. 
But there are high hopes for a significant 
increase in U.S. sales to Rumania, whose 
foreign exchange earnings from oil make it 
perhaps the most promising customer in all 
the Eastern European Communist bloc. 
Asked what the United States hoped to gain 
from the agreement, a top official said: 
"Business." The United States, he argued, 
has been unnecessarily inhibited from sell-
ing to Rumania on terms comparable to 
those enjoyed by Western European com-
petitors. 
Politically, the United States has wider 
purposes. Rumania, experts have been 
noting, has been a prime example of greater 
independence among the satellites from Mos-
cow's controL It has refused to allow its 
relatively rich economy to be tightly inte-
grated within the Soviet bloc, defied Mos-
cow's dictation on Communist Party doc-
trine, taken a neutral position in the Sino-
Soviet dispute and turned increasingly 
toward Western Europe to trade. 
The United States wants to encourage all 
these trends, and not just in Rumania. 
Yugoslavia and Poland have long been rated 
the most independent minded of the Eastern 
Europeans and the United States has tried 
with aid and trade to encourage this loosen-
ing in bloc relations. The hope now is that 
with Rumania looming as a more important 
trading partner with the United States, 
others, such as Hungary and Czechoslovakia. 
may be increasingly encouraged to turn west-
ward. 
U.S. diplomats, in fact, would like to add 
another enticement to Rumania by con-
ferring upon her the most favored nation 
arrangement under which this country treats 
all its trading partners alike; trade conces-
sions offered tp any particular country are 
automatically extended to all others. Only 
Poland and Yugoslavia among, Communist 
countries have been extended this arrange-
ment and the issue remains a touchy one 
with Congress. So the administration Is un-
likely to press the matter on Capitol Hill this 
year, .officials said yesterday, though it was 
discussed in the talks with the Rumanians. 
But yesterday's agreement almost certainly 
will bring an effort hi Congress next year to 
confer most favored nation status upon Ru-
mania. 
By way of promoting greater United States-
Rumanian trade, the United States plans to 
open a trade promotion office in Bucharest, 
and the Rumanians have indicated an in-
tent to expand their New York City trade 
office. Both countries will exchange tourist 
promotion offices, too. 
Officials said the U.S. arrangements with 
Rumania are the most liberal for any East-
ern European nation, except for Yugoslavia, 
which is treated practically on a par with 
Western trading partners. Poland has a li-
censing arrangement which does away with 
some individual licenses on U.S. exports but 
experts said It isn't as far reaching as the 
agreement with Rumania. 
Mr. DOMINICK. In part, the article 
reads as follows: 
"U.S. diplomats, in fact. would like to add 
another enticement to Rumania by con-
ferring on her the "most favored nation" ar-
rangement under which this country treats 
all its trading partners alike. 
That Is exactly what the Senator was 
saying. 
By doing this, we are granting a Com-
munist-governed nation?and it is only 
about 3 percent Communist, with the 
rest of the people being "thin" Commu-
nists, the ones who would like to get out 
from under?the designation of a most 
favored nation. 
The only thing I can see in all this 
Is the idiocy of this kind of arrange-
ment. 
Mr. ALLOW. If my colleague from 
Colorado will yield to me for one closing 
comtnent I should like to say that I am 
struck with the idiocy of the effect that 
popular slogans have on our State De-
partment and on others. I cannot help 
recall two facts. First of all, it was after 
we started to make our wheat deal with 
Russia that Great Britain, Italy, France, 
and even Spain started to expand their 
trade with Cuba. 
Second, this shows the extent to which 
slogans like "It is easier to deal with a 
fat Communist than a lean one" have in-
fluenced the thinking of our State De-
partment. 
It is about time for us to get down to 
a realistic way of thinking, and stop ac-
cepting the concept that we can capture 
and retain the leadership of the world 
with slogans which come out of Madison 
Avenue. That is what we have had for 
the past 4 years. 
Mr. DOMINICK. Mr. President, I sin-
cerely appreciate my colleague's addi-
tion to this colloquy. I know how 
strongly he has felt about this subject 
for a long time. . 
I also wish to express my appreciation 
to him for the leadership which he took 
in trying to interest Senators to talk 
about Cuba as long ago as last summer, 
when a group of us came to the floor 
with one idea after another on what we 
.could do about Cuba. Certainly, trading 
with Russia was not one of the ways by 
which we thought we could liberate Cuba. 
Exactly the opposite was true. I ex-
press my appreciation to the Senator. 
Mr. MUNDT. Mr. President, will the 
Senator yield? 
Mr. DOMINICK. I yield. 
Mr. MUNDT. First of all. I wish to 
convey to the Senator from Colorado, 
who has given us this very significant 
address, my congratulations for the very 
careful research and the great amount of 
study and background material he has 
brought before us and before the Ameri-
can public by his address this afternoon. 
I believe he has put his linger on what 
was before Congress last fall, and will be 
again sometime next month, as one of 
the real, basic decisions to be made by 
America in connection with the cold war 
It seems to me that history pretty -well 
records now that America reached a 
crossroads in its policy during the de-
bates alluded to by the Senator. That 
was last October, November, and Decem-
ber. They started in the last few days of 
October, as I remember. At that time, 
America sharply changed a foreign policy 
which had served it pretty well for nearly 
17 years. At that point American pres-
tige and world leadership began to slide. 
It has steadily fallen ever since. 
Once we ceased to be constructive, once 
we ceased to be consistent, and once we 
-- June 2 
began to ask others to do what we refused 
to do ourselves, we appeared to the world 
as hypocritical, mercenary, and incon-
sistent. 
Second. lacking direction and leader-
ship from the United States, the free 
alliance has been steadily falling apart. 
We see examples of it in NATO, as well as 
In Franco-American relations. We see 
Indications of it in the failure of our allies 
to follow any suggestions we make in con-
nection with Cuba. I believe that Pro-
fessor Nutter very prophetically and 
properly related foreign trade, which the 
Senator from Colorado has been discuss-
ing so effectively this afternoon, with the 
problem of foreign aid, which will be 
before us shortly after we dispose of the 
civil rights bill. 
It is now before the House of Repre-
sentatives. More and more Americans 
are indicating by what they write and 
what they say, including editors and 
commentators by their expressions, that 
we are indeed engaged in a completely 
self-defeating program when, on the one 
hand, as Professor Nutter pointed out 
and as the Senator from Colorado [Mr. 
DOMINICK] has emphasized, we propose 
to trade increasingly with Communist 
countries and, on the other hand, pro-
pose to continue a multibillion-dollar 
aid program to non-Communist coun-
tries, justified exclusively on the concept 
that by so doing we help to protect them 
against aggression and potential aggres-
sion by communism. 
Can the Senator from Colorado find 
any logic oi any possibility of success in 
such an inconsistent, self-defeating 
trade-aid program as the one which this 
administration has placed before the 
country? 
Mr. DOMINICK. I cannot think of 
any possibility of reconciling the two pro-
grams at all, provided that our foreign 
policy is to try to win. I am not a bit 
sure that our foreign policy at this point 
Is designed for that purpose. If it is not 
designed for that purpose, if it is de-
signed merely to frame a platform upon 
which we can hopefully exist for a little 
while longer, perhaps the administration 
is trying to keep everything quiet at the 
same time. But if we are trying to do 
something to support our former pro-
gram of saying that people should have 
the right to determine their own form of 
government, then aiding both sides, in-
cluding neutralists and the underdevel-
oped, with our foreign aid, to prevent the 
Communists from taking over, and then 
aiding Communists to strengthen their 
economy, it is the most hopeless futility 
lean think of. 
Mr. MUNDT. There is no possibility 
of success in that kind of program, by 
seeking, on the one hand, to bail out the 
Communists from the economic prob-
lems which their nefarious system has 
imposed upon them, while using the 
money of American taxpayers, through 
the Export-Import Bank, to bail out 
Communists, and then coming back to 
the taxpayers and saying, "We want an-
other $3 billion installment in 1964 in 
order to build up the non-Communist 
world because it is threatened with new 
aggressions from the Communists, whom 
we have recently built up with American

to deliver them to the Communists' doors 
at the cheapest possible oceanic freight 
rates, and to sell the materials to them 
at the lowest possible prices, so that we 
will get that business, instead of having 
the other nations get it, and also to ex-
tend to the Communists the easiest and 
longest possible credit terms. I think 
that is our foreign policy. If that is our 
foreign policy, certainly it is doomed to 
failure, because only Communist coun-
tries can profit by means of such a 
policy. 
Mr. DOMINICK. I completely agree; 
and I could not state the matter more 
effectively, even if I tried 15 times to do 
so. 
About 1 year ago, members of our 
State Department went to Western Eu-
rope, and tried to persuade the Western 
European countries not to grant long-
term credit to the Russians, so as not to 
enable the Russians to obtain the needed 
materials with which to construct an oil 
pipeline through Western Europe; and 
we fought and fought against having 
those countries give Russia long-term 
credit in that connection, inasmuch as 
the extension of such long-term credit 
was the only basis on which Russia would 
deal for such pipe. 
But here we go, reversing our policy 
and giving 5-year credit to Rumania?
and 5-year credit is long-term credit in 
anyone's language?and doing the same 
thing for Hungary, but saying to all these 
countries, "You must stay out of Cuba." 
It seems to me that we are seeing the 
very beginning of a Johnson policy to 
er4 
12012 Approved FeblyulemsieReiliacifteDPgt, 
which are so substantial that in all like-
lihood they will have to come before the 
U.S. Senate, for ratification as a treaty. 
So here is our chance to explore what is 
involved in this business. 
Furthermore, I know that soon the 
Senate will be working its will on the 
legislative authorization bill for foreign 
aid. That bill has already been passed 
by the House of Representatives. So 
here, too, we have a chance, by means of 
amendments?under the happy way the 
Senate operates, by means of which no 
amendment need necessarily be ger-
mane?to do something constructive 
about this situation and to place a re-
straining hand on these "happiness 
boys" who think communism has now 
changed its purpose and its objective," 
and who believe we should now feed com-
munism and should encourage it and 
should pat it on the back, instead of do-
ing as we did for 16 years?curtail and 
check it. 
Furthermore, Mr. President, before 
Congress adjourns, the Senate will have 
an opportunity to vote on appropriation 
bills dealing with foreign aid; and then 
Senators can raise the question of how 
inconsistent our foreign policy has be-
come. If we really believe the cold war is 
over, and that now is the time to kiss and 
make up with the Communists and to 
give them the benefit of an aid program 
based on credit to them, then surely we 
cannot believe there is any reason for ex-
tending a single clonar of credit aid to 
the non-Communist world on the basis 
of the argument that that is the only 
way to keep them from going Communist. 
So we are the custodians of the public 
purse will face some rollcall votes on 
these issues in the next few weeks. To 
those who read the RECORD and to those 
who have concern, let me say I hope they 
will make their wishes and attitudes and 
desires crystal clear to all Members of 
the Senate before Senators face up to 
those very significant rollcall votes, as 
the amendments come before us. 
Again, I salute the Senator from Colo-
rado [Mr. Doxibuck) on his masterly 
presentation of a matter which is by far 
more significant and important than the 
question of what is happening in Laos or 
in Vietnam, because in this case we are 
dealing with the system which is being 
operated from Milscow and Peiping, with 
its tentacles spread all over the world; 
and if we are to deal with it effectively, 
we must deal with it at the center, rather 
than at the periphery. Otherwise, what 
we do will be love's labors lost. 
Mr. DOMINICK. Mr. President, I 
thank the Senator from South Dakota, 
who from the very beginning, even as 
early as last fall, has tried to have us 
deal effectively with this problem. 
Mr. ALLOTT. Mr. President, will 
my colleague yield briefly to me? 
Mr. DOMINICK. I yield. 
Mr. ALLOTT. My colleague has spo-
ken of the proposed nuclear plant for 
Rumania which is being discussed. 
There are perhaps three main sources 
of power, as my distinguished colleague 
knows; they are coal, other carbonifer-
ous materials, and oil. So can anyone 
suggest why we should be dealing with 
Rumania, which has one of the richest 
A 1 
and largest and most extensive oil fields 
in the world, for the supplying of nu-
clear power? Some States in our own 
country have no method of providing 
fuel except by means of nuclear power; 
and that is understandable. But I am 
sure no reasonable man could under-
stand why the Romanians would want a 
nuclear plant, in view of their valuable 
oil resources, unless they could sell the 
oil somewhere else at a greater profit, 
and unless they are in hopes of duping 
the United States to build a nuclear 
plant for them, or unless the Romanians 
hope to acquire from the nuclear plant 
strategic information or materials 
which would be of benefit to them?
which again brings us through the cycle. 
Today, Great Britain is greatly upset 
over this matter. 
Just last week, I placed in the Cox-
CRESSIONAL RECORD an article, from the 
London Daily Express, which shows how 
upset the British people were because we 
had developed the A-11, without giving 
them any of the information, whereas, 
on the other hand, we had taken from 
them all of the key details on the ultra-
secret information they had developed 
from their new supersonic bomber and 
its electronic equipment. 
Since 1960, we have managed to topple 
one government in Canada because we 
were trying to force nuclear warheads 
on the Canadians; and we have had our 
own difficulties with France, because we 
refused the same thing to De Gaulle. 
How inconsistent we can be in connec-
tion with our foreign policy, I do not 
know. The word "naive" has been used, 
and the word "romanticism" has been 
used: but I say this is a childlike ap-
proach to the problems of the world and 
to foreign relations, because it does not 
deal with reality. Instead, it deals with 
matters entirely outside of reality. 
Again I say to my distinguished col-
league that I am very proud of the speech 
he has made this afternoon to the 
Senate. 
It has been a real contribution, be-
cause unless we somehow are able to 
reverse the almost inevitable run to the 
sea that the State Department has fol-
lowed for the past few years, we stand 
In grave danger in this world. The Sen-
ator has contributed greatly. 
Mr. DOMINICK. I was about to say 
to my distinguished colleague that every 
now and then I hear representatives of 
the State Department say that our 
foreign policy must remain fluid. If it 
becomes any more fluid than it is now, 
we shall all be washed out to sea in the 
water they have created, without any 
real substance to anything they have 
been doing. 
Again I appreciate my colleague's par-
ticipation in this particular colloquy. 
CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1963

of the bill (H.R. 7152) to enforce the 
constitutional right to vote, to confer 
jurisdiction upon the district courts of 
the United States to provide injunctive 
relief against discrimination in public 
accommodations, to authorize the Attor-

constitutional rights in .public PaCilitieS 
and public education, to extend the Com-
mission on Civil Rights, to prevent dis-
crimination in federally assisted pro-
grams,? to establish a Commission on 
Equal Employment Opportunity, and for 
other purposes. 
'THE CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE MUST BE RESOLVED AT 
THE COMMUNITY LEVEL 
Mr. CASE. Mr. President, final reso-
lution of the civil rights issue will come 
In the community. I wish to call atten-
tion to one example of such community 
action in my own State of New Jersey. 
In Newark, a group of young people 
associated with the Congregation Wnai 
Jeshurun have begun this year a reme-
dial tutorial program aimed at helping 
about 20 Negro boys and girls in elemen-
tary and high school subjects. The 
members of the temple youth group are 
themselves high school students. They 
give of their free time on Saturdays in 
order to share the classrooms of their 
temple with Negro children from the 
neighborhood. The project has met with 
a deservedly wide response, both in and 
out of the State: and other such pro-
grams are now underway. For example, 
in New Jersey alone, congregations in 
Trenton, Teaneck, Bayonne, River Edge, 
East Orange, and Elberon have begun or 
plan similar tutorial programs. 
I ask unanimous consent that two 
newspaper articles describing the New-
ark program be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the articles 
were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
From the New York Times, Apr. 26, 19641 
JERSEY NEGROES TUTORED SY JEWS?YOUTHS 
SEEK A MEANINGFUL APPLICATION OF JUDAISM 
NEWARK, April 25.?A group of Jewish 
youths here have been tutoring some 20 
Negro boys and girls in elementary and high 
school subjects as part of a program for the 
"meaningful application of the teachings of 
Judaism." 
The Jewish youths are members of the 
Congregation B'Nai Jeshurun_ In explain-
ing the project, Rabbi Barry H. Greene, asso-
ciate spiritual leader of the congregation, 
quoted Maimonides, the 12th century Jewish 
philosopher and doctor, who wrote: 
"The advancement of learning is the high-
est commandment." 
"We are dedicated to the preservation and 
the meaningful application of the teachings 
of Judaism," Rabbi Greene said. "We are 
translating our convictions into deeds." 
Every Saturday morning from 9:45 to 12, 
about 20 Negro boys and girls from the 4th 
to the 12th grades share the classrooms of 
the 118-year-old temple. On hand to greet 
them and work with them are members of 
the youth group, 15 to 18 years of age. 
While other junior members of the con-
gregation are attending religious classes and 
.Piaturday morning services, the Negro chil-
dren are tutored in simple arithmetic, spell-
ing, physics. Latin. English, geography, his-
tory, algebra, and reading. 
The tutorial project was started 2 months 
ago at the suggestion of Stuart Rosengarten 
of South Orange, a junior at Columbia High 
School. A member of the Mitzvah Corps, a 
youth group sponsored by reform congrega-
tions. Stuart lived and worked last summer 
among the needy in Puerto Rico. 
The program was publicized in the area's 
schools and the boys' club at Stella Windsor 
Wright Home, a city housing project. The 
response, Rabbi Greene revealed, was "spon-
taneous and heartwarming."
