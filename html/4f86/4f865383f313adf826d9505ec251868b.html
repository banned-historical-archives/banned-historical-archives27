 Far East
 V I ETNAM
 Political activity in Saigon
 this week generally centered on
 preparations for the September
 elections and on forthcoming gov-
 ernmental changes.   Differences
 between the government and the Bud-
 dhist Institute subsided somewhat
 in immediate importance.
 The government has begun to
 brief provincial officials on the
 application of the recently promul-
 gated law under which a constitu-
 ent assembly will be elected in
 September.   It is not yet clear
 whether any military officers will
 be candidates,  although a military
 member of the Directorate has been
 put in charge of political activ-
 ity for the armed forces.   Polit-
 ical and religious groups appear to
 be organizing for the elections
 along traditional lines, with no
 significant new alliances evident
 thus far.   Government leaders rec-
 ognize that the Buddhist Institute
 and some Catholic factions oppose
 the elections, but are hoping that
 indirect persuasion will change
 the attitude of these recalcitrant
 groups before September.
 Government Changes
 The government hopes to an-
 nounce its new cabinet on 1 July.
 One significant realignment, which
 stresses the importance of rural
 pacification, will elevate Revo-
 lutionary Development chief Gen-
 eral Thang to the status of a "su-
 perminister," responsible for the
 ministries of interior, public
 works,  and agriculture.   One cab-
 inet minister with close ties to
 the Buddhist Institute is ex-
 pected to be removed.
 Meanwhile,  "watchful waiting"
 and some uneasiness continue to
 characterize public reaction to
 devaluation and other economic re-
 form measures announced on 18 June.
 As expected,  some adverse reaction
 has developed including a strike
 by construction workers in the Sai-
 gon area, but no definitive trends
 relating to the over-all success
 or failure of the reforms are yet
 evident.
 Moderate and militant Bud-
 dhist leaders within the Buddhist
 Institute apparently remain un-
 able to resolve their differences
 over continuing opposition to the
 Ky government.   After raiding the
 institute compound last week,  the
 government made some conciliatory
 moves toward the moderates, but
 no accord has yet been reached.
 Military Situation
 The scene of major fighting
 shifted during the past week from
 South Vietnam's western highlands
 to the northern and central
 coastal plain.
 Northwest of Hue, in Thua
 Then Province, two US Marine bat-
 talions conducting search-and-de-

 tactical air strikes, artillery,
 and naval gunfire, US forces killed
 92 Communists while sustaining only
 moderate casualties.
 In Phu Yen Province, eight US
 battalions continued to press Op-
 eration NATHAN HALE against two
 PAVN regiments near the provincial
 capital of Tuy Hoa.   The 12-day
 ground sweep has thus far taken
 more than 400 Communist lives and
 has seriously disrupted enemy
 plans--gleaned from captured docu-
 ments--for a major regimental as-
 sault against a nearby US/Vietnam-
 ese Special Forces camp.
 South Vietnamese forces en-
 joyed mixed success during the con-
 duct of two large-scale search-and-
 destroy operations in the Mekong
 Delta.   Southwest of Saigon, gov-
 ernment regulars lost 30 killed and
 72 wounded in two days  (26-27 June)
 of heavy fighting in Dinh Tuong
 Province, but rallied on 28 June
 by killing 82 Viet Cong during a
 one-day sweep in southernmost An
 Xuyen Province.
 The two major Communist-
 launched attacks this week were
 notably unsuccessful.   A 29 June
 battalion-sized ambush against a
 Vietnamese Marine battalion in
 convoy along coastal Route 1, north-
 west of Hue, was beaten off, with
 enemy losses of 202 killed, versus
 50 government troops killed and 84
 wounded.  A regimental-strength
 attack the next day against ele-
 ments of the US lst Infantry Divi-
 sion conducting EL PASO II north of
 'Saigon in Binh Long Province was
 also repulsed with only moderate
 'Friendly losses, against more than
 :300 Viet Cong killed.
 Air Strikes on North's POL Dumps
 US Air Force and Navy aircraft
 conducted several coordinated
 strikes against major North Vietnam-
 ese POL storage facilities begin-
 ning on 29 June.  Pilots reported
 that heavy damage was inflicted on
 the installations at Hanoi, Hai-
 phong, Do Son, Bac Giang, and Viet
 711ri.   No definitive assessment
 could be made from the initial
 bomb damage photography, however,
 because of heavy smoke and flame
 rising from the targets.   These
 facilities were estimated to com-
 prise some 70 percent of North
 Vietnam's bulk petroleum storage
 capacity.
 Two US aircraft were lost to
 ground fire during the attacks. At
 ].east five other air force aircraft
 were damaged--three by flak and two
 in an aerial engagement with four
 North Vietnamese MIG-17 fighters--
 but all these returned safely to
 their bases.  One of the DRV
 fighters was shot down.
 Hanoi's initial propaganda
 reaction to the strikes stressed
 that the attack provided a great
 victory for the North Vietnamese
 air defense which, Hanoi claimed,
 shot down seven US aircraft dur-
 ing the raid.

 that construction previously ob-
 served at Yen Bai in northwest
 North Vietnam is an airfield. The
 area of grading and leveling now
 is about 10,500 feet long.   If con-
 struction continues at the present
 rate,  this airfield will probably
 be ready for use by the end of the
 year.
 More Soviet Helicopters to DRV
 Four more MI-6 Hook helicop-
 ters have arrived in Hai hon
 I                         I  North Vietnam
 now  ias six or these heavy-duty
 helicopters--the first two arrived
 in early March and have since been
 operating from Hanoi/Gia Lam Air-
 field.
 These helicopters could
 play a significant role in logis-
 tic operations or in the tacti-
 cal deployment of weapons systems
 such as surface-to-air missiles.
 The Hook is capable of moving
 more than 70 troops or 17,000
 pounds of cargo for a distance
 of over 300 miles.  There is no
 evidence at present, however, to
 indicate what use the North Viet-
 namese might make of these new
 aircraft.
 The latest report on infiltra-
 tion from MACV provides further
 evidence that movement of North
 Vietnamese into the South reached
 a new high of some 24,275 during
 the first five months of 1966. Of
 this number, MACV lists 10,300 as
 confirmed and the remainder as
 either probable or possible.   By
 comparison, MACV estimates that

 INDONESIAN CONGRESS NEARS ADJOURNMENT
 The Indonesian congress  (MPRS),
 the nation's highest policymaking
 body,   is still in session but has
 probably completed the major ac-
 tion expected of it.    Having en-
 dorsed President Sukarno's 11 March
 transfer of executive power to
 General Suharto and having unan-
 imously named General Nasution
 as MPRS chairman, the members have
 gone into committee sessions and
 will probably adjourn on 4 July.
 General Suharto apparently
 feels that the MPRS action both af-
 firmed and strengthened his mandate
 and gave the army all the authority
 it needs for the time being.   In a
 press interview on 27 June, Suharto
 made clear that he plans no imme-
 diate action to strip Sukarno of
 titular authority.  He will prob-
 ably continue, however, to counte-
 nance anti-Sukarno propaganda de-
 signed to reduce the President's
 prestige and discredit his policies.

 Although the MPRS clearly is
 being stage-managed by the military
 leadership, speech-making and dis-
 cussion sessions from 22 to 26 June
 indicated that some differences of
 opinion are permitted. The National
 Party  (PNI)  took a generally pro-Su-
 karno line;                         the opportunistic Moslem
 Nahdatul Ulama  (NU)--the only other
 large recognized party--moved away
 from the pro-Sukarno line it has
 been taking for the past few weeks
 toward the strongly anti-Sukarno pos-
 ture of the minor parties.
 Now that his authority has
 been confirmed by the MPRS, Suharto
 probably hopes to move against left-
 ist military and civilian elements
 in East and Central Java.   He has re-
 placed the army commanders in both
 provinces, where pro-Sukarno senti-
 ment has been vigorously expressed
 in recent weeks and where an effec-
 tive Communist underground could de-
 velop unless remedial steps are
 taken.   Suharto has appointed one
 of his closest and most trusted ad-
 visers, Major General Sumitro, to
 the East Java post and a strong anti-
 Communist personality, lr~leneral,
 Surono, to Central Java.
 SHAKE-UP IN CHINA'S SECOND-ECHELON LEADERSHIP
 There are mounting signs that
 the political turmoil in Peking has
 produced 4 massive shake-up of key
 officials just below politburo rank.
 A host of officials dropped
 out of public view before or about
 the time of the fall of politburo
 member Peng Chen in March or April.
 While failure to make public ap-
 pearances is not an infallible guide
 to a leader's standing, it is
 usually a good one.   Appearances
 enhance a leader's stature and
 serve to remind subordinates, who
 are often kept in the dark about
 such things, that he still exercises
 authority.   Of the 73 officials
 who filled key party and military
 posts before 1 April, about the
 time that Peng Chen fell,  31 are now
 out of view (see chart).   On 1 Jan-
 Page 5
 uary  1966, only 15 of the 73 had
 one unreported for as much as three
 months.
 The recent unsettled political
 scene has produced considerably more
 pressure than usual for a leader to
 do what he can to establish that he
 is in good standing.   The Peking
 press has been adding to these pres-
 sures by demanding that responsible
 officials "personally" take charge
 of the current ideological purifica-
 tion drives in their own domains.
 Such demands could foreshadow charges
 of malfeasance against officials who
 can be represented as not complying.
 '.Phis was the technique used to bring
 down Peng Chen.   It would seem to
 establish the general proposition
 that, when political shortcomings
 are publicized in a leader's domain

 and he is not represented as engag-
 ing in the necessary clean-up ac-
 tion, he is in trouble.   At the
 moment,  at least eight provincial
 leaders and two department heads in
 the central committee have been
 implicated by this type of indirect
 attack.   In all these cases the of-
 ficial concerned has been out of
 sight for months.
 An indication that the fate
 of such men has not been entirely
 settled was provided by Peoples
 Daily on 24 June.   It urged leading
 officials who are under criticism
 not to lose heart if the "masses
 post a few big-character posters"
 (i.e. make public accusations), but
 to try to clear themselves.   Since
 Peoples Daily had attempted unsuc-
 ces sfully earlier this year to de-
 fend Peng Chen,  its presentadvice
 may not be very reassuring to
 those under attack.  Moreover, only
 a few days earlier the Peking press
 had applauded the use of such post-
 ers as "detectors of monsters" who
 will "turn pale with fear and break
 into a cold sweat at the sight of
 them."
 Description of the "freaks and
 monsters" under attack indicate
 that they,  like Peng Chen, may be
 accused of harboring bourgeois re-
 visionist sentiments and of working
 against the party and Mao Tse-tung.
 This does not fit well with the
 background of the men involved.
 Almost to a man, those whose status
 is now in question are hard-line
 men with an unswerving record of
 devotion to Mao and his dogmatic
 policies.
 Little is known about new ap-
 pointments.   Peng Chen was replaced
 in early June as first secretary of
 the Peking city party organization by
 a man believed to be a protege of
 party general secretary Teng Hsiao-
 ping.  The only key appointment an-
 nounced since then is a new deputy
 director of the general political
 department  (the party's control ap-
 paratus in the army).   This man
 served under Teng Hsiao-ping in
 Southwest China in the early 1950s.

 CHOU EN-LAI'S VISIT TO RUMANIA ENDS IN DISPUTE
 Chinese Communist Premier
 Chou En-lai's eight-day visit to
 Rumania exposed the flimsiness
 of the two countries' claim to a
 close relationship.   It achieved
 little or no agreement on sub-
 stantive issues and ended in an
 open clash with Rumanian party
 boss Ceasescu.   Chou, however,
 fared better in Albania and Pak-
 istan,   the other two stops on
 his tour.
 Rumania has used its rela-
 tionship with China to underscore
 its neutrality in the Sino-Soviet
 rivalry and thus to advance its
 independence of Moscow.   China
 has encouraged   Rumanian inde-
 pendence as a tactic in its strug-
 gle with Moscow, and cited ties
 with Bucharest to counter asser-
 tions that Albania is its only
 friend in Eastern Europe.   The
 usefulness of these tactics for
 both Rumania and China was re-
 duced by Chou's   visit.
 There was little effort to
 hide the differences between
 Chou and Ceasescu as the 16-24
 June visit came to an end.   In-
 stead of the customary communi-
 que, brief unilateral statements
 were issued from Bucharest and
 Peking which mentioned no sin-
 gle item of agreement.   In his
 farewell remarks, Chou. described
 the talks merely as "useful" and
 "frank," a clear indication of
 their unsatisfactory nature.
 Rumania's refusal to allow
 Chou to use Bucharest as a plat-
 Page  7
 form for an attack on Soviet
 "revisionism" combined with Chi-
 nese intransigence on Vietnam,
 apparently triggered the dispute.
 Discord became public when the
 two  leaders arrived over two
 hours late at a friendship rally
 which had been billed as the
 climax of the visit.   Disagree-
 ment was apparently so sharp
 that prepared speeches had to be
 discarded and innocuous extem-
 poraneous remarks substituted.
 The Albanian portion of
 Chou's trip,  24 to 28 June, was
 more congenial.   Although it was
 uneventful,  it shed light on the
 difficulties in Bucharest.   In a
 speech honoring Chou, Albania's
 Premier Shehu clearly referred
 to the Rumanians when he charged
 that "certain people consider
 themselves neutral in this life
 and death struggle....   Neutrality
 ...merely favors modern revi-
 sionism."
 The key to Sino-Pakistani
 relations is shared enmity toward
 India.   During Chou's two-day
 stop in Rawalpindi,  en route
 home,   he probably sought assur-
 ances that recent Pakistani for-
 eign policy developments do not
 portend a major shift  toward
 the West.   The Chinese are un-
 doubtedly concerned over the re-
 cent ouster of pro-Chinese for-
 eign minister Bhutto,                                                                           and a re-

 WARSAW DEMONSTRATIONS HIGHLIGHT CHURCH-STATE STALEMATE
 The antiregime, prochurch
 demonstrations in Warsaw last
 weekend have sharpened the di-
 lemma both sides face--how to
 maintain their basic positions
 without generating a full con-
 frontation on the popular level.
 The church cannot trans-
 late its manifest popular sup-
 port into political action be-
 cause the regime would not hesi-
 tate to use force to restrain
 it.     The government, however,
 fears that overly repressive
 methods would touch off extensive
 rioting and that direct action
 against Cardinal Wyszynski would
 make a martyr of him.
 There are indications of
 rising concern in the Roman
 Catholic hierarchy and among
 party and nonparty elements
 alike that both sides have mis-
 handled the situation and that on
 occasion they have engaged in
 unnecessary provocations.
 Both sides realize that
 Polish national interests dic-
 tate an eventual settlement,
 possibly with a new church-
 state agreement, but the imme-
 diate situation may worsen as
 each side probes the other's de-
 termination.  The regime may im-
 pose additional restrictions on
 the church millennium celebra-
 heighten tension and could lead
 to worse popular outbursts.

 FRENCH NON-COMMUNIST LEFT MOVES TOWARD COOPERATION WITH COMMUNISTS
 Francois Mitterrand,  lately
 a candidate for the French pres-
 idency, is moving his non-Commu-
 nist Federation of the Democratic
 and Socialist Left toward closer
 cooperation with the French Com-
 munist Party  (PCF).   Mitterrand's
 immediate goal is to strengthen
 the federation for the legisla-
 tive elections which must be
 held by next March but could
 take place sooner.
 Mitterrand'has publicly em-
 phasized that "nothing comes
 ahead of the union of the left,
 which evidently includes the Com-
 munist Party."                             His present
 "shadow cabinet" includes no Com-
 munists but he has opened the
 way for PCF representation in a
 government of the "left" by say-
 ing "we will not contest elec-
 tions with the support of popu-
 lar forces in order to form a
 majority the next day without
 them."  Mitterrand's movement to
 the left has been endorsed by
 Guy Mollet and Rene Billeres,
 the leaders of the Socialist and
 Radical Socialist parties which
 make up most of the Mitterrand
 federation.
 The PCF's reaction has been
 wary,  and it is going ahead with
 plans to run its own candidates
 in the first round of the elec-
 tions.   The PCF argues that the
 left must agree on electoral
 tactics and a program before a
 true alliance is possible.   Never-
 theless,  the PCF has welcomed
 the opportunity to cooperate
 with the federation and has
 sought to facilitate cooperation
 by playing down doctrinal dif-
 ferences.
 Gaullist  attempts to get
 votes from the left electorate,
 which will surely be stepped up
 with De Gaulle's trip to the So-
 viet Union, have also encouraged
 the PCF and the federation toward
 cooperation.   Leaders of both
 groups acknowledge this common
 threat.
 Some elements of Mitter-
 rand's federation--notably,So-
 cialist leader Gaston Defferre
 do not favor his move to the
 left,   and Jean Lecanuet,  leader
 of the non-Gaullist center group-
 ing, has extended the welcome
 mat to dissatisfied federation
 leaders.   It is doubtful many
 will accept his offer, however.
 Even Defferre has endorsed Mit-
 terrand as head of the federa-
 tion at least through the elec-
 tions.
 The long-term significance
 of Mitterrand's move is far from
 clear.   He, Mollet,  and its other
 backers undoubtedly see the move
 as a way of facilitating elec-
 toral alliances on the key sec-
 ond round of the assembly elec-
 tions when most of the seats will
 be filled.   Even a united left
 is extremely unlikely to win an
 assembly majority, however,  so
 the federation leadership can af-
 ford to be free with its promises
 of postelection cooperation.
 Continuing PCF concern that it
 will be used in the election and
 then discarded is probably the    25X1
 best evidence that no irrevo-
 cable commitment to a "popular
 front"   et exists

 SE RE T
 NATO DEVELOPMENTS
 The formal withdrawal on 30
 June of French personnel and mil-
 itary units from NATO assignment
 has underscored the continuing
 uncertainty over France's future
 military cooperation with the
 Alliance.
 At the meeting of the North
 Atlantic Council  (NAC)  on 28
 June,  the French representative
 said that France was willing to
 "subordinate" its forces to NATO
 command in wartime and to arrange
 a mission and role for these
 forces.   He avoided, however,  any
 specific details on such arrange-
 ments and reiterated the French
 position that these were pri-
 marily military matters to be ne-
 gotiated between SACEUR and the
 French chief of staff--not in the
 political forum of the NAC.
 The Germans on 30 June of-
 fered the French a declaration
 on a transitional arrangement for
 stationing French forces in Ger-
 many following French withdrawal
 from the NATO military structure.
 The text of the declaration was
 changed after the French indi-
 cated they would not accept it
 as originally worded.   It now
 reads that a German "representa-
 tive" rather than a German general
 will be assigned to French
 headquarters in West Germany to
 represent the sovereignty of the
 Federal Republic.   The Germans
 also toned down their statement
 on the mission of the French
 forces.
 There is still some doubt,
 however, how the French will re-
 act to the German statement.
 French officials still maintain
 that the 1954 London-Paris Agree-
 ments provide a legal basis for
 the stationing of French troops
 in Germany, and that the German
 declaration is unnecessary.   In
 objecting to this German approach
 a French official said that it
 would not facilitate the ulti-
 mate solution of the French
 troop question.
 Meanwhile, the Netherlands
 Government appears to be moving
 toward formally accepting the
 Headquarters, Allied Forces Cen-
 tr-al Europe  (AFCENT), on its ter-
 ritory.   The Germans also have
 indicated a desire to have AFCENT.
 However, the appointment of Ger-
 man General von Kielmansegg to
 replace the French general as com-
 mander of AFCENT appears to make
 the Netherlands the more likely
 host for AFCENT inasmuch as the
 Dutch have said that they would
 accept a German general in that
 command only if it is located out-
 side German

 POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN YEMEN
 As Kuwaiti mediation efforts
 and Egyptian indecision have in-
 creasingly paralyzed all govern-
 ment action in Yemen,               anti-Egyp-
 tian movements now developing
 among Yemeni republican groups
 may presage a new reshuffle of
 the present regime along more lib-
 eral lines.
 During the last three months
 a number of republican political
 movements have sprung up in the
 usual Yemeni garb of a conference
 of leaders.  All these recent
 meetings have had certain aims in
 common:   the removal of President
 Sallal, continuation of the gov-
 ernment's "republican" guise, es-
 tablishment of some kind of
 broadly based government,  and the
 withdrawal of Egyptian troops.
 The republican conferences
 are largely gatherings of leaders
 from various tribes.   In the most
 recent meeting an important tri-
 bal chief played a leading role.
 This course of events appears
 somewhat analogous to the tribal
 conference at Khamir in the spring
 of 1965, which led up to a brief
 period of more liberal rule.
 Party lines within the re-
 publican ranks are becoming con-
 fused.   Ardently pro-Egyptian
 and cautiously anti-Egyptian lead-
 ers alike have become almost per-
 manent residents of Cairo, while
 seeking to gain Nasir's favor.
 Cairo in fact seems unde-
 cided on policy in Yemen.   Al-
 though Nasir has publicly prom-
 ised substantial Egyptian troop
 reductions, the British decision
 to evacuate the Aden base by
 1968 may be delaying the Egyp-
 tian withdrawal from Yemen.   The
 Egyptians presumably hope to be
 able to bring maximum influence
 to bear on an independent South
 Arabia.
 The Kuwaiti mediation ef-
 forts in Yemen may account for
 further Egyptian hesitation.
 So far the mediation has not
 accomplished more than giving
 the Egyptians and the Saudi
 Arabians a channel to use with-
 out resuming direct negotia-
 tions.   Neither Nasir nor Fay-
 sal appears to have softened
 his views substantially in the
 first round of exchanges.   In-
 deed, the strong Egyptian press
 criticism of King Faysal's
 visit to the US will undoubtedly
 further complicate his relations 25X1
 with Nasir and may spell an end
 to the entire mediation effort.

 SSE ACRE T
 BRAZZAVILLE REGIME AND
 A long-developing showdown
 between the dominant political
 leadership of the radical Congo
 (Brazzaville) regime and impor-
 tant elements of the 1,700-man
 army came to a head this week.
 It is not yet clear whether army
 units supporting the mutiny
 which began on 27 June or the
 civilian leaders have the upper
 hand.
 Prime Minister Noumazalay's
 appeal to the army to turn in
 its weapons and return to camp
 has not been obeyed,  and the
 loyalty of troops patrolling the
 streets is uncertain.   Govern-
 ment leaders have taken refuge
 in a Brazzaville stadium, where
 they are being protected by the
 approximately 200 Cuban soldiers
 of the Presidential Guard.   Loyal
 Cuban-encadred militia are also
 guarding the radio station.
 Neither of the opposing forces
 appears willing to test its
 strength by combat.

 officers, but has not yet been
 able to assert his authority over
 one paracommando company, some
 other elements of the army and
 gendarmerie, and an undetermined
 number of civilians--apparently
 mostly northern fellow tribesmen
 of the disciplined officer.
 Army dissatisfaction with
 the government has mounted over
 the past several months.   Army
 officers have been resentful of the
 MNR's persistent downgrading of
 army influence and the building up
 of paramilitary forces which oper-
 ate under party control.                                                              Certain
 army elements have strongly pro-
 tested the use of Cuban recruits
 in the Presidential Guard as well
 as the arming of the party youth
 wing and the urban militia.   The
 National Assembly's approval last
 week of a decree establishing a
 collective army command and a polit-
 ical department in the army, as
 called for by the MNR central com-
 mittee last spring, probably also
 added to army hostility.
 The disturbances were
 sparked by army resentment over
 punitive action that the govern-
 ment had taken against a popular
 junior officer.   The officer's
 tribal brothers in the military
 partially destroyed the head-
 quarters of the government party,
 the National Revolutionary Move-
 ment  (MNR).   Soldiers led by para-
 troopers seized Army Chief of
 Staff Mountsaka, some of his
 staff officers,  and the head of
 the security police.   Prime Min-
 ister Noumazalay has replaced
 the army high command with po-
 litically reliable junior
 President Massamba-Debat, who
 has in the past been the target of
 army criticism, returns this week
 to the country to face a situation
 which could snowball into a genuine
 military coup.   Should the MNR hold
 its own against the generally mod-
 erate army, however,  the militant
 extremists in the regime will be
 strengthened.   A purge of the army
 and a further reduction in army
 influence would probably follow,
 causing the regime to rely more than
 ever on the Cuban- and Chinese Com-
 munist-trained paramilitary forces
 for its protection.

 KENYA GETTING TOUGH TOWARD SOMALIA
 The government of Kenya is
 adopting an increasingly belli-
 cose stance toward neighboring
 Somalia. With recent national as-
 sembly by-elections safely out of

 to stamp out Somali insurgency in
 northeastern Kenya.
 Dissident activity has in-
 creased sharply there in the past
 two months as bands of Kenyan
 Somalis, trained and equipped by
 the Somali Army, have re-entered
 Kenya.   Their demolition of
 bridges and attacks on military
 outposts have demonstrated an im-
 proved capability and greater ag-
 gressiveness.
 The Kenyatta government has
 been irritated further by Somali
 radiobroadcasts supporting former
 vice president Odinga's opposi-
 tion party in the by-elections.
 Last week Nairobi severed commer-
 cial relations with Somali and
 prohibited Somali citizens and
 airline flights from entering
 Kenya.   Kenyan propaganda broad-
 casts to the border area have
 also been stepped up.
 Two weeks ago in a skirmish
 200 miles inside the border Ken-
 yan tribesmen speared to death
 some 40 Somali guerrillas armed
 with guns.   Nairobi now is begin-

 ARGENTINE GENERALS OUST PRESIDENT I LLI A
 The Argentine Army,  in a
 carefully planned and well-exe-
 cuted coup, removed President
 Illia on 27 June,  ending three
 years of constitutional govern-
 ment.   The overthrow was swift
 and bloodless and came after
 weeks of rumors and speculation
 that a coup was imminent.
 Argentina's new president,
 Lieutenant General Juan Carlos
 Ongania, who was inaugurated on
 29 June,  established his reputa-
 tion as a capable executive while

 The gen-
 erals prdecided to move
 against Illiafbecause they con-
 cluded that he would not actually
 carry out the policy changes   he
 promised in cabinet meetings
 earlier in June.   The generals
 may also have been concerned that
 Illia was trying to promote dis-
 unity among the top generals
 through War Secretary Castro
 Sanchez.
 were constitutionalists
 opposed in principle to military
 involvement in government.   How-
 ever,  they had made it known that
 they considered the armed forces
 the final arbiter in national af-
 fairs and that they would not al-
 low the government to lead the
 country toward anarchy or eco-
 nomic disaster.   Although Illia
 had made progress in solving some
 of Argentina's pressing economic
 problems,  he was reluctant to take
 repressive actions against strik-
 ing workers or proscribe Peronist
 participation in national elec-
 tions.   The military were concerned
 at the disruption of public serv-
 ices by strikes and the threat of
 a Peronist victory in important
 provincial elections that were
 scheduled for March 1967.
 The coup began late on 27
 June after General Pistarini,  the
 army commander in chief,  had con-
 ferred with his staff and prob-
 ably with Ongania.   Pistarini an-
 nounced the arrest of General
 Caro,  Illia's only ally among the
 top generals, and repudiated the
 authority of Castro Sanchez.   This
 left Illia with no military sup-
 port.   The president's futile ef-
 fort to dismiss Pistarini was
 merely a gesture and did not pre-
 vent the generals from following
 their operations order.   The coup
 brought no reaction from either
 the Peronists or Illia's own Radi-
 cal Party supporters.

 missed the congress and taken over

 the Supreme Court but did not
 immediately name a new cabinet.
 No effort to hold elections is
 likely until the regime can pro-
 mulgate a new political party
 statute that will effectively
 control the threat of Peronism.
 Reaction to the coup in
 Latin America has been varied but
 relatively mild.  Venezuela has
 condemned the coup and will break
 relations in accord with its
 Betancourt Doctrine--refusing to
 recognize governments that come
 to power through a coup.

 BRITISH HONDURANS PROTEST TERMS OF INDEPENDENCE AGREEMENT
 Popular feeling has been
 aroused in British Honduras  (Be-
 lize) by opposition leader Philip
 Goldson's premature disclosure
 of an agreement the UK is nego-
 tiating with Guatemala over in-
 dependence for the colony--to
 which Guatemala has long asserted
 a claim.
 Popular demonstrations which
 began a few weeks ago are becom-
 ing more violent.   Demonstrators
 on the evening of 27 June mobbed
 the Guatemalan Consulate in Be-
 lize City and burned a consulate
 car.   Later a group approached
 Premier George Price's house but
 was frightened off by police.
 Other groups caused damage to a
 cabinet minister's house and car.
 Radio Belize--the country's only
 station--was also attacked, sus-
 taining minor damage.  About 300
 demonstrators participated in
 rioting which was finally broken
 up by police using tear gas.
 This is the first such dis-
 order in Belize since 1918.  Most
 off the violence can be attributed
 to Goldson's scare tactics. Dur-
 ing recent rallies he has ac-
 cused Price of selling Belize
 out to Guatemala.  Goldson has
 buttressed his argument by point-
 ing to a stipulation in the
 agreement making Guatemala re-

 after independence.   He has also

 British Honduras
 disclosed that Guatemalan citi-
 zens would have free entry to
 Belize.
 The agreement as it stands
 is not unfavorable to the Bel-
 zians, but Goldson and the op-
 position appear determined to
 sabotage it to prevent Price from
 being credited with achieving
 the country's independence.
 Price's reassuring statements do
 not seem to have allayed the ap-
 prehension and confusion caused
 by Goldson's disclosure, and the
 premier may even be losing the
 support of his own party on the
 issue.
 Guatemala has protested
 the incident of 27 June and has
 demanded that the United Kingdom
 provide guarantees for the con-
 sulate's safety.   In the absence
 of such guarantees,  the Guate-
 malan Government stated that it
 might be unable to continue with
 the mediation and would be forced
 to take measures for the consu-
 late's protection.                                                                 Governor Stal-
 lard proclaimed a curfew on 28
 June in order to try and stem the
 demonstrations.
 Although the agreement will
 probably be signed eventually,
 signature may well be delayed
 by the furor which Goldson has
 raised.

 GUATEMALA RETURNS TO CONSTITUTIONAL RULE
 Guatemala's long struggle
 to return to constitutional gov-
 ernment ends on 1 July with the
 inauguration of Julio Cesar Men-
 dez Montenegro and Clemente Mar-
 roquin Rojas as president and
 vice president respectively.
 Mendez' term will be difficult
 at best.   The reforms needed to
 alleviate the country's serious
 economic and social problems
 would alienate the armed forces,
 which now support him.
 The inauguration will it-
 self be an achievement.   Terror-
 ism from both ends of the politi-
 cal spectrum has challenged Men-
 dez' assumption of office.   Commu-
 nist-led leftists, at first hop-
 ing for a champion in the new
 president, now believe the Rev-
 olutionary Party, which elected
 him, no longer represents their
 interests.   They have concluded
 that his regime in effect can be
 no more than a continuation of
 the military government.   They
 therefore promise to oppose it
 until it falls.
 Far rightists, on the other
 hand, fear that Mendez' assump-
 tion of power will signal a re-
 turn to Communism reminiscent of
 the
 The fears of neither ex-
 treme appear justified.  Mendez
 is inexperienced in practical
 politics.   His actions since his
 election suggest, however, that
 he will be moderate in his poli-
 cies, and more open to advice
 than was Colonel Peralta, the
 retiring chief of government.
 As a liberal, Mendez is not
 likely to be quite as rough on
 the Communists as the military
 government.   He probably hopes
 to reduce their effectiveness by
 solving the problems that make
 Communism attractive.   On the
 other hand, Mendez' cabinet has
 been chosen for the most part
 from elements acceptable to the
 military--the final arbiter in
 Guatemalan politics.
 Among the more pressing
 problems facing Mendez is the
 possibility of continued terror-
 ism.   Six kidnapings in the past
 month and a half point up the
 ability of the FAR--the Commu-
 nist Party's action arm--to ter-
 rorize at will, although it is
 in no position to overthrow the
 government.

 DOMINICAN PRESIDENT BALAGUER TO BE INAUGURATED
 Joaquin Balaguer will be
 inaugurated as Dominican presi-
 dent on 1 July in ceremonies to
 be attended by foreign digni-
 taries including Vice President
 Humphrey.   Extreme leftists
 have been discussing the possi-
 bility of upsetting the inaugura-
 tion, but they do not appear to
 have firm plans for a large-
 scale, organized protest. Never-
 theless, some attempt to inter-
 fere with the ceremonies--per-
 haps by a terrorist act--or to
 embarrass Vice President Hum-
 phrey seems likely in view of
 charges that Balaguer was fraud-
 ulently elected and the intense
 anti-Americanism of Dominican
 extremists.
 Although the security forces
 are making preparations to en-
 sure the safety of inaugural
 participants,  they are not fully
 capable of offering protection
 against all contingencies.
 statements of intention might
 have raised.
 In his farewell talks,
 provisional President Garcia
 Godoy has been sounding very
 much like a presidential candi-
 date in the next election. F_
 He has praised
 his regime for dealing with a
 situation in which it was "asked
 to perform almost a miracle" and
 has expressed satisfaction over
 the accomplishment of his major
 task, the holding of peaceful
 elections and the orderly trans-
 fer of power.   Garcia Godoy has
 claimed credit for what he feels
 to be the "rehabilitation" of
 the military--although it re-
 mains to be seen whether there
 has been any fundamental change
 in the attitude of the armed
 forces toward civilian power.
 Balaguer's inaugural speech
 and his cabinet appointments, to
 be announced afterward, will of-
 fer the first firm indication of
 the new regime's intentions.
 Both are well-kept secrets. Bal-
 aguer's silence has contributed
 to the preinaugural calm by pre-
 venting his opponents from capi-
 talizing on issues which any
 Garcia Godoy feels his po-
 litical stock received a further

 BOLIVIAN ELECTIONS STILL ON
 The national elections on 3
 July will be held in an uneasy
 atmosphere.   Incidents of vio-
 lence are probable before and on
 election day, but only a chaotic
 situation-or the assassination
 of the assured presidential vic-
 tor, Rene Barrientos, would be
 likely to cause cancellation of
 the voting at this late date.
 The army is on alert to guard
 against disorder.
 Barrientos' opponents have

 CHILEAN AND COLOMBIAN LEADERS
 Chilean President Eduardo
 Frei made a strong plea for Latin
 American economic  integra-
 tion during a speech on 22 June
 in honor of visiting Colombian
 President-elect Carlos Lleras
 Restrepo.   Presumably, Frei ex-
 pects Latin American chiefs of
 state who attend Lleras' inaug-
 uratioxl on 7 August to discuss
 details of integration in prepa-
 ration for the meeting of Western
 Hemisphere chiefs of state that
 has been proposed for late this
 year or early 1967.
 Frei suggested creation of
 a high-level study group to pro-
 pose policies covering regional
 investment, multinational proj-
 ects, and other matters of common
 concern.   He proposed that in ad-
 dition to economic integration,
 the meeting of hemisphere leaders
 strations large enough to force
 EL cancellation.   Some groups now
 urge abstention and blank voting
 to reduce Barrientos' margin of
 victory and undercut his claim
 to a popular mandate.    As many
 as four of the six contending
 parties may pull out of the race
 at the last minute.  The tradi-
 tional manipulation of ballots
 and voting irregularities, if un-
 usually extensive, would also
 cloud Barrientos' victory.  F__~ 25X1
 PRESS HEMISPHERE ECONOMIC TIES
 should discuss regional arms con-
 trol and agrarian reform.
 Lleras, in his response,
 agreed on these topics and added
 that study should be devoted to
 establishing a complementary eco-
 nomic relationship between the
 Latin American countries and the
 United States.
 The Colombian president-
 elect is on a tour of Venezuela,
 Chile, Peru, Ecuador, and Panama.
 In Venezuela he stressed Latin
 American economic integration in
 remarks closely paralleling
 those made later by Frei.   The
 statements of the two leaders,
 as well as Frei's past initiatives,
 indicate that they intend to
 press for a unified approach to
 economic association in Latin
 America and for greater economic
 cooperation from the US.7--~ 25X1

 FIDEL CASTRO RESUMES NORMAL ACTIVITIES
 Castro apparently has de-
 cided to end his two-month period
 of withdrawal from the Cuban
 limelight.
 On 27 June, Castro boarded
 the ship returning Cuban athletes
 to the island from the Carrib-
 bean Games in Puerto Rico,  al-
 though he did not participate
 in the formal welcoming cere-
 monies for the team.   The Cuban
 Communist Party newspaper Granma
 prominently featured pictures
 of Castro congratulating the
 athletes in its 28 June edition;
 pictures of Castro had been un-
 characteristically absent from
 Cuban papers for about three
 weeks.
 Castro delivered his first
 speech since 1 May on the eve-
 ping of 29 June. He appeared
 very relaxed and self-assured
 during the 70-minute speech and
 the ceremonies preceding it,
 which were broadcast on island-
 wide radio and television.
 There was no sign of physi-
 cal illness; mental illness would
 not necessarily be obvious. Cas-
 tro's speaking manner, however,
 and over-all demeanor were char-
 acteristic of his public appear-
 ances over the past seven years.
 Castro concentrated on charg-
 ing the US with having harassed
 the Cuban athletes at the Carib-
 bean Games.   He did not rebut
 the rumors circulating about his
 health and political position.
