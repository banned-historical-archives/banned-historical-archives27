 ECONOMIC OBSERVATIONS AS WAR INDICATORS
 H. C. Eisenbeiss
 THE 1964 STUDIES IN INTELLIGENCE AWARD
 25X1    The Studies' annual award for the most significant contribution to
 the literature of intelligence was shared in 1964 among three authors
 whose articles were adjudged to be indistin uisliable in degree of
 merit.  The  were:
 1                      -3 By special dispensation the usua
 prize was augmented so that each winner could be given $200.
 Approved For Release 2005/01/05 :
 The Soviet Union, being the only country with enough military
 capability to constitute a serious threat to U.S. power, is the principal
 focus in the intelligence effort to give warning of any deliberate
 all-out attack on this country.  Under prevailing conditions as of the
 mid-1960's, economic intelligence can contribute to this effort: in a
 number of important ways.  The USSR has elaborate civil institu-
 tions whose main purpose is to facilitate the transition of the economy
 from peace to war: they provide for stockpiles of all kinds of goods,
 industrial and agricultural, and maintain the administrative apparatus
 needed to integrate industrial and transportation facilities into a
 military effort.  The Soviet civil defense program is already extensive
 and would undoubtedly be augmented in the event of imminent
 hostilities.  Finally, a variety of economic problems would hinder the
 Soviets from undertaking the kinds of massive action called for by
 their military doctrine except after a great deal of advance preparation;
 the transportation system, most notably, operates at close to capacity
 under normal loads.
 It is true, however, that economic intelligence has a diminishing
 role in today's early warning process.  Under conditions that prevailed
 immediately before World War If, or even the Korean war, logistics
 were frequently more important than either weapons systems or
 tactics, and the potential of economic intelligence for strategic warn-
 ing was correspondingly great.  But as such current military con-
 cepts as "zero-reaction-time" long-range ballistic missiles with nuclear
 warheads and "instant-ready" airborne armies approach realities, in-
 formation on the slow build-up of a logistical base contributes less
 toward determining whether, or where and when, the technically
 advanced weapon systems are to be used.  It is nevertheless to be
 expected, since the maintenance of "instant readiness" will be very
 expensive in this era of rapid technical advance, that economic intelli-
 gence will continue to be useful for strategic early warning.

 In the USIB Watch Committee's monitoring of war indicators Com-
 munist China, though a poor second to the USSR, remains of con-
 siderable concern for a variety of reasons.            These reasons include a
 very large army, a regime which sometimes talks as if it considers
 war an enjoyable pastime, an inclination toward what Mr. Kent calls
 the "dramatically wrong decision," 1 its proximity to the Nationalists'
 offshore islands and Taiwan itself, its Indian adventure in 1962, and
 the expectation of its eventually producing nuclear weapon systems.
 Today, however, it not only lacks modern weapon systems, but the
 ability of its economy to support a sustained effort by its massive but
 obsolescent ground force is, at best, in doubt.  The achievement of
 a significant modern military capability will require a large and
 successful industrial program, one as much concerned with produc-
 tion of basic commodities (e.g. high-grade steels and technically com-
 plex chemicals) as with military equipment proper.  The economic
 intelligence officer charged with strategic warning of hostile Chinese
 action against the United States will be preoccupied with the regime's
 progress toward such a program for some years to come.
 Civil Defense 2: the MOG
 It could be argued that with present collection capabilities civil
 defense is the best bet as source for successful strategic warning of
 Soviet intention to start a big war.  Furthermore, it seems probable
 that the potential for collecting civil defense information of the warn-
 ing type will improve.
 Although the Soviet civil defense program seems to have changed
 policy several times since the war, and although there are grounds
 for debate over its exact size and effectiveness, there is no question
 that it is large; in comparison with those in the West it is enormous,
 involving millions of people.  Whether the current policy calls for
 urban blast shelters or urban evacuation plus fallout shelters makes
 no great: difference in its value for warning.  Either way, the public
 has to know what it is supposed to do, when to do it, and where to
 ' Said of the Soviet decision to install strategic missiles on Cuba, Studies VIII 2,
 2 Soviet: civil defense has long been a concern of the economic intelligence of-
 ficer because the present program began as an integral part of the postwar re-
 constructiion of the Soviet economy.  Today the Ministry of Defense and other
 institutions are heavily involved in the program, but the role of economic institu-
 tions also continues to grow.

 go.  The best of security is not likely to conceal even the earliest of
 the massive public actions that go with the declaration of a "special
 period" of possible imminent hostilities.  Urban evacuation, more-
 over, presently an integral part of Soviet policy, requires several days.
 The program is as complex as it is large, and it appears to stipulate
 detailed procedures for every part of Soviet society.  These details
 are one of the reasons that it offers good opportunities for the collec-
 tion of strategic warning information.  In Moscow they include
 such seeming minutiae as relocating to the suburbs fire engines sta-
 tioned in the central city, removing national treasures (probably
 including Lenin's body) for safekeeping, preparing for window-by-
 window blackouts, and probably even making "final disposition" of
 carnivorous, poisonous, and obstreperous residents of the zoo.  So
 long as persons friendly to the United States can move about in Mos-
 cow, we have simple, inexpensive, and reliable collection devices-
 such as an embassy wife airing the heir-to give us the crucial in-
 formation on implementation of civil defense procedures.~S
 A Moscow Observer's Guide, assembled by the National Indications
 Center, covers the possibilities for simple physical observation at
 times of crisis.  The MOG was used during the Cuban missile crisis,
 and in retrospect it can be said to have proved a useful tool.  One
 defect in the performance was notable, however: an ominous sign-
 distribution of gas masks before the eyes of U.S. personnel on one
 of the upper floors of the Foreign Ministry building-was reported
 by the highest priority cable, whereas reports of negative indications-
 neither Lenin nor the live inhabitants of Moscow, neither fire engines
 nor ferocious animals ever left their normal quarters-arrived by slow
 boat, or not until personnel returning to Washington underwent an
 end-of-tour debriefing.  Next time it would help to know in Washing-
 ton which items in the MOG had been checked and which of these con-
 veyed "no information," which were normal, and which ominous.
 Prospects for increasing the MOG type of emergency collection
 appear to be improving.  There is now an Indian consul stationed
 in Odessa; his cooperation would double (from 1 to 2) the cities
 covered.  Then if a U.S. consular office opens in Leningrad the cov-
 erage could be tripled.
 'The simplicity, economy, and reliability of embassy wives emerges from com-
 parison with other intelligence systems, not other wives.

 Disaster Columns
 Paramilitarized relief and recovery columns based in rural areas
 under the civil defense program offer another possible set of indicators.
 The task of these "disaster columns" is to move into a nuclear-
 devastated urban area and attempt to assist the injured, limit damage,
 and restore or salvage what they can.  They arc to get their personnel
 mostly from the farms, their transport and earth-moving equipment
 from farms and from construction projects.  Similar city units to
 be evacuated in an emergency draw personnel and equipment from
 factories, utilities, and service groups.  Both the Soviet press and
 secret intelligence suggest that the rural relief columns have not yet
 developed much beyond the planning and organization stage, but
 there has been recent public exhortation to increase efforts to equip
 and train them.
 We have no source with a demonstrated ability to observe and report
 promptly an alerting of the disaster columns.  Still, collection pos-
 sibilities seem fairly good.  The columns will directly involve large
 numbers of people.  And if alerted they would disrupt the activities
 of even larger numbers by their claims for equipment on farms and
 construction activities.  Thus the immediate task is to determine the
 procedures prescribed for the disaster columns as they are organized
 and trained, so that emergency collection requirements and means to
 meet them may be established.
 The foregoing discussion may suggest that the prime task in day-to-
 (lay observation of the Soviet civil defense system is measurement of
 its alertness for near-term use.  In fact, it is not.  Although portions
 of the system have been alerted and exercised, there is no evidence
 of any national exercise having been staged, even one of a command-
 post type.  The most widely held (but not necessarily the best) guess
 at the reason for this apparent shortcoming is that the Soviet popula-
 tion has a proclivity to read too much between the lines and might
 react in ways that would hurt, for example panic buying.
 Over the years, in support of the National Indications Center and
 the Watch Committee, economic analysts have charted the slowly
 growing capabilities of the civil defense apparatus.  They seek the
 answers to such questions as: "Does the disaster column program
 have a readiness date?  Does it require the diversion of resources
 from some other user?   How effective will the columns be?"  In
 order to answer such questions as well as possible the collection and

 analysis of data on civil defense developments must be a day-to-day
 process rather than one concentrated on periods of crisis.
 The overwhelming majority of the answers have, in NIC jargon,
 been "negative." That is, we have never (Cuban crisis included)
 discovered an urgent effort to achieve early readiness, peak at a given
 time, or otherwise meet a specific target date.  It appears rather that
 the Soviet regime believes civil defense to be a necessary part of
 the balanced economic and military power base of the state which,
 like the other parts of that base, must more or less keep pace with
 general progress.
 Suppression for Surprise?
 What of the possibility of a surprise attack plan which omits any
 direct pre-action alerting of the civil defense apparatus?  Summarily,
 such a plan is considered to be unlikely.  Even if we ignore the
 strategic military reasons for using the civil defense system, what-
 ever its capability (as well as the even more cogent military reasons
 for not meditating an attack at all under the present balance of
 forces), there remain a number of considerations against it.
 Civil defense is an integral part of Soviet power.  In some areas,
 when a regional military authority has conducted an air defense
 exercise, the regional civil defense mechanism or some part of it has
 also been exercised.  The military authority can do this because civil
 defense is now a military responsibility.  The regional military com-
 mander is trained to consider civil defense another of his many tools.
 Consequently, it appears that a decision to omit civil defense would
 be administratively as complex as a decision to cancel participation
 of aircraft in an air defense effort and leave the job entirely to missiles.
 The military commander, however, does not bear sole responsibility
 for civil defense.  The party, the economic bureaucracy, and the civil
 government each has its own responsibilities, chain of command, and
 interlocking liaison with respect to it.  In order to omit civil defense
 from a surprise strike plan, positive :instructions to prevent the execu-
 tion of standing operating procedures would thus appear to be
 necessary at a multitude of geographic locations-would need to go to
 party officials, military officers, civil government bureaucrats, and
 managers of factories, and would need to go to many levels in each
 of these hierarchies.  With so many people involved, the planners of
 the strike have a problem: would the security of the surprise be well
 served by an attempt to leave out civil defense?

 Most important is the probability that the party leaders would not
 accept a military plan which excluded civil defense participation.
 One totally unacceptable result of such a plan might be the decimation
 or worse of the party while the military leadership remained rela-
 tively unimpaired.  Another consideration of the Presidium ought to
 be the reaction of the surviving members of the populace, as well as
 of the party, if available civil defense facilities had not been put
 to use.
 Above all, the party leaders remember the effects of World War II
 on Soviet industry and the prodigious logistic efforts required to
 fight the war and afterward to rebuild the economy and restore the
 culture.  Even now the demographic effects of World War II present
 problems of labor force and military manpower.  It is these memories
 and the dangers of nuclear warfare, not charity, that have caused the
 party leaders to expend the money, effort, and manpower to create
 a civil defense organization, along with strategic reserve and in-
 dustrial mobilization systems.
 To sum up, the Soviet civil defense program involves millions of
 people in a multitude of tasks.  It is considered a basic component of
 national power, and there are strong reasons for expecting it to be
 activated even in connection with a planned surprise attack.  Cur-
 rent collection systems are relatively inexpensive and reliable, and
 they are capable of timely reporting on the activation of at least
 some part of the system.  Prospects for this reporting appear to be
 improving rather than diminishing.  Let us now look at indicators
 in other economic fields that can be monitored with existing collec-
 tion capabilities.
 Transportation: Pre-attack Moves
 Because the Soviet transportation system is usually operating at
 close to capacity, a major increase in military movements would dis-
 rupt normal traffic patterns.  The operation of the system is conse-
 quently of great interest for strategic early warning.  Moreover, be-
 cause the bulk of transport is concentrated in rail facilities, the Soviets
 are concerned that the existing system might not give them the flexi-
 bility and service they would need after a war had begun, and schemes
 to remedy the projected shortcomings are probably also of value in
 pointing to possible indicators.
 These propositions are not just wishful thinking on the part of
 U.S. intelligence officers.  The July 1961 issue of the Soviet journal
 Approved For Release 2005/01/05 :
 SECRET
 Military Thought (secret edition) contained an article which discussed
 military transport in much this light.  The author was quite concerned
 lest the West be tipped off to any imminent action against NATO by
 the total disruption of normal freight when reinforcements were
 moved to the western front.  He proposed, in order to allay this
 danger, that a large proportion of normal movements be continued
 and the reinforcement trains mixed in as a minor part: of total rail
 activity over several weeks.
 From the Soviet viewpoint the problem of concealing this westward
 reinforcement of the ground armies, a necessary action under the
 "balanced force" concept, is complicated by the difference in gauge
 between Soviet and European railroad tracks.  At each border cross-
 ing point, paired tracks of the two sizes parallel one another in order
 to facilitate train-to-train transloading.  These transfer yards have
 grown slowly but steadily, and some now reach many miles both east
 and west of the Soviet border.
 Surveillance of the routes, crossing points, and yards in the western
 USSR and abutting parts of eastern Europe should reveal by direct
 observation the reinforcement of the armies facing NATO.  For in-
 direct acquisition, information useful to the strategic warning process
 should he available to a number of railroad men, bureaucrats in
 economic administration, and plant officials on both sides of the
 border.  These people would quickly be aware of an either general
 or partial embargo on civil freight or passenger traffic, and many of
 therm could determine whether it resulted from military usage of the
 system.
 Wartime Capability
 Soviet military planners also appear to be much concerned about
 the difficulties their transportation system will face in providing the
 required service after the start of a war.  A variety of measures
 intended to strengthen it have been proposed, some of which would
 offer opportunities to collect early warning information.  Because
 some of the measures could also serve purely economic ends, how-
 ever, both collectors and analysts must treat them with care.
 A central organization for the control and direction of all forms
 of transportation would increase the efficiency, flexibility, and recuper-
 ability of the Soviet system.  With central direction, priority freight
 could be more rationally shuttled among various routes and carriers

 and around bottlenecks and damaged facilities; repairs could be
 organized in better accord with national priorities.  The intelligence
 officer concerned with strategic warning therefore watches constantly
 the administration of Soviet transport.  Centralization, subordination
 to the Ministry of Defense or a supraministerial body, and military
 staffing of either the operating or directing levels of transportation
 administration are considered possible moves that would have mean-
 ing for early warning.
 A wide range of physical improvements in peacetime have also
 been suggested as means to strengthen the wartime capacity of Soviet
 transport.  At one end of the range these consist simply of more
 facilities, especially of kinds other than railroads-more pipelines,
 more and better roads, improved canals, and more double tracking.
 Less grandiose proposals are for road and rail bypasses around cities,
 alternative bridging, and extension of Soviet-gauge track farther into
 eastern Europe.  Proposed emergency measures include road trailers
 to move rail cars across breaks in rail lines, stocking of reconstruction
 materials in the vicinity of probable Western priority targets, and
 last-minute evacuation of transportation equipment from target areas.
 We do not know which of these proposals might be implemented in
 preparation for an anticipated war.  Economic development requires
 that some of them-the "Friendship" oil pipeline into eastern Europe,
 for example-be acted on without particular regard to their military
 utility.  Others, particularly evacuation of transport equipment from
 target areas, would be either very expensive or so disruptive of normal
 military and civil activity that they are unlikely.  But if evacuation
 did occur, it would be an unmistakable sign that large-scale hostilities
 were imminently expected.
 Finally, in addition to land transportation, the intelligence officer
 must follow Soviet merchant shipping and civil aviation.  Normality
 in the deployment and occupation of the merchant marine has been
 a comforting phenomenon during past crises.  Sometimes the Soviets
 have moved ships out of an area of immediate danger, but they have
 not put them in safe havens.  If they really mean business one would
 expect them to move at least some ships to home or friendly ports.
 As to aviation, almost as many high-performance air transports are
 operated by Aeroflot as by U.S. air carriers. These planes plus the
 military air transports provide a substantial airlift potential, and so
 any unusual activity in Aeroflot needs to be identified.

 SECRET
 Thus transportation, like civil defense, should be featured in a list
 of activities that under existing collection capabilities could provide
 useful, perhaps conclusive, strategic warning information.
 Strategic Reserves
 Over the years the Soviets have quietly created a vast and expensive
 system for maintaining strategic stockpiles.  It is administered un-
 obtrusively and with unusual care from Moscow by the Chief Direc-
 torate of State Reserves, apparently directly responsible to the Council
 of Ministers.  Its object is support for a war effort.  It was used for
 the initial effort in the Korean war.
 For this purpose the Directorate administers and operates stores of
 foodstuffs, raw materials for industry, semiprocessed materials, finished
 manufactures, medical supplies, fuels, spare parts, construction ma-
 terials--some of almost everything.  It is not the only operator of stor-
 age facilities in the Soviet Union: the Ministry of Defense has depots;
 factories and distributors hold limited inventories; economic and
 political administrative institutions keep some stocks.  But State Re-
 serve inventories are probably by far the most important.  They were
 designed, for example, to enable the economically deficient eastern
 littoral of the Soviet Union to operate for extended periods without
 the aid of the vulnerable Trans-Siberian Railroad.
 Under Khrushchev the rules governing the withdrawal of materials
 stored in the facilities of the Directorate were relaxed to allow use
 in casing the effects of natural disaster and economic abnornahties-
 in June 1964 Tass noted that farmers lacking seed were being supplied
 from state reserves.  But the primary purpose of the system-strategic
 reserve for war-remains.  Withdrawals from stock are not a routine
 bureaucratic procedure; high officials must rule on each individual
 release and approve the replacement schedule.  Accounting proce-
 dures, including physical inventory, are apparently stringent.  The
 refreshing process, putting old stores into service and replacing them
 with newly procured goods, seems to be pursued with care.
 As long as the Chief Directorate of State Reserves exists it must: be
 presumed to have a role in any Soviet plan to start a large war, and
 it may have one to play in limited war.  In recent years, however,
 the value of this knowledge to the indications process has l:,een slight
 because the intelligence community lacks a source for timely and de-
 tailed information on actions of the institution.  The USIB's Economic
 Intelligence Committee reaffirmed in 1964 that development of such
 -RDP78T03194A000200030001-0
 Appro      niRdl 2005/01/05: CIA
 a source is one of the first-priority requirements for economic informa-
 tion.  Prospects for filling this requirement are uncertain.
 Industrial Mobilization
 Another unique Soviet institution (or perhaps set of institutions) is
 designed to coordinate the efforts of industry and transport in filling
 wartime military needs.  It is most easily explained in terms of the
 pre-1957 economic administration because there was information on
 its operation then.  Prior to 1957 the Soviet government ran the econ-
 omy through a series of ministries based in Moscow; there was an oil
 ministry, an aircraft production ministry, an ocean fleet ministry, etc.,
 sometimes close to fifty of them.  Each ministry was subdivided into
 departments, some functional, like supply or finance, some product-
 oriented, e.g., fighter aircraft production, and some geographical, as
 eastern area oil exploration.
 Now each ministry had also a military affairs office called the "Mili-
 tary Mobilization Department," and the administration of each factory,
 railroad section, river fleet, or other activity had a similar subdivision
 under one of a variety of names-mobilization section, special depart-
 ment, secret department.  These two, the ministry department and
 the factory department, had a number of different responsibilities, de-
 pending on the kind of ministry or facility it was in.  For example, at
 plants which had been converted after the war to the production of
 agricultural implements instead of small arms and ammunition, the
 responsibility of these departments included maintenance of an ability
 to switch back to arms-the required equipment, limited quantities
 of raw materials, and personnel with the right skills.  Another re-
 sponsibility was to keep track of the draft status of the employees in
 order to assure that quotas for draftees and for skilled production
 personnel would both be met.  It was the factory departments that
 handled classified documents at the plant level.
 Like all Soviet institutions, these were required to submit many
 reports.  The instructions for some of the reports, which have come
 into the hands of U.S. intelligence, clearly assumed that these units
 would be deeply involved in the Soviet actions precedent to initiation
 of any major military action.  In some instances they were the chan-
 nel through which the civil defense readiness of the plant was reported
 to the ministry in Moscow and would have been the channel for re-
 porting the effect of enemy military action on the plant.  The intel-
 ligence officer concerned with economic activity in the Soviet Union
 Approved For Release 2005/01/05  CI,
 DP78TO3194A1Q3NQRcbTPrs
 presumes that these units will continue to play a considerable part
 in any Soviet preparations for war.
 Again, as reflected in the 1964 updating of EIC priorities, the in-
 telligence community needs a source.  In at least one of the few eco-
 nomic ministries that retain more or less their pre-1957 form, the units
 continue to exist and to function. Soviet attitudes and procedures
 being what they are, the continuity of the system would be-assumed
 without any evidence at all, but there is some indication that units at
 the factory level also continue to exist. A source is now needed for
 much more basic information than the alerting of the system.  We
 need to reidentify its parts and rediscover its procedures after the con-
 stant shuffle of industrial administrative bodies since 1957.                                                                                                         Prospects
 for such a source do not appear very bright.
 The four activities discussed above (strategic reserves, the industrial
 mobilization system, civil defense, and the transportation system) are
 the ones that the economic intelligence officers in CIA consider the
 most likely to be productive for indications purposes.  They are the
 fields that are kept under constant review for the National Indications
 Center, subject of course to what the quantity and quality of reporting
 are at any given time.  The list of four, however, by no means exhausts
 the economic phenomena from which early warning indicators may be
 derived.  Indeed, they may not even be the most important.
 General Economic Activity
 At least some economists turned intelligence officers believe that
 their most important contribution to the warning process is the con-
 tinuing analysis of the totality of Soviet economic policy; they believe
 that a Soviet decision as important as to go to war will be reflected in
 a variety of broad economic developments.  These might include
 great changes in the share of investment resources going to support
 military activities, in the division of epnstruction activities between
 projects offering a relatively quick return and those having a slow
 return over a very long period, in the proportion of total goods avail-
 able assigned to people for consumption and to industry for investment
 opposed to that available for military forces, in the way the annual
 addition to the labor force is divided up, and in the assignment of
 priorities among the various claimants in the economy.
 Other intelligence officers, including economists, arguing that data
 on general economic policy is too imprecise to be of great value for
 early war          o t that conclusions reached in the last 10 years
 -RDP78T03194A000 a     1-6
 Approved For Release 2005/01/05 : CIA-RDP78T03194A000200030001-0
 or so via this route have regularly been that the Soviet Union is hell-
 bent for peace.  The fact that there has been no global war in this
 period does not demolish the objection: in late October of 1962 econo-
 mists involved in intelligence were not likely to be making arrange-
 ments for a winter vacation in southern Florida, even though the
 evidence from Soviet economic policy suggested that it would be rea-
 sonable to do so.
 Strictly, it can be claimed only that the total economic picture should
 tell us what the potential enemy ought to be considering if he is ra-
 tional, not what he will necessarily do.  The Chinese Communists,
 for example, would be unable at present to sustain a massive military
 operation over an extended period, but Mao and friends might still
 start one.  At times, nevertheless, the total economic view can he
 fairly conclusive.  In late 1963 and up to Khrushchev's fall in 1964
 a variety of sources, secret and public, have given evidence of a Soviet
 economic policy so clearly reflecting peaceful intent that it should pre-
 vail even in the face of fairly strong contrary evidence.
 In practice, the National Indications Center and the Watch Com-
 mittee have been interested in Soviet economic policy only as back-
 ground for the week-to-week examination of more direct indicators.
 Though this practice may seem to neglect an important part of the
 total picture, there are valid reasons for limiting broad economic policy
 to a background role.  The information on which judgments about
 this policy are based is more often than not obtained from open Soviet
 sources and is therefore subject to manipulation by the Soviets.  It
 also requires interpretation, which can be a long and involved process,
 and frequently it is not timely enough for indications purposes. Ma-
 terial' in open sources becomes available when the Soviet publisher is
 ready, not when the economic intelligence officer needs it.
 Bottleneck Intelligence
 Under this heading one can collect the unending flow of reports on
 shortages of particular kinds of equipment and materials in the Com-
 munist world.  The warning watchman is traditionally interested in
 the bottleneck because it might reflect a diversion of the commodity in
 question from normal to military use ("Lucky Strike `green' has gone
 to wart").  A typical example might be the periodic Soviet shortages
 of petroleum products, generally diesel fuel or bunker oil.  The bottle-
 neck report of a commodity specialist is generally his most frequent
 contact with the indications process.  All such reports are carefully
 reviewed for indications implications.
 The commodity specialist himself, however, is not likely to consider
 bottleneck intelligence a very useful input for strategic warnin;4.  Be-
 cause the Communist economies are continually trying, to get from
 available resources the maximum output and because these resources
 frequently do not stretch as far as the planners had scheduled them,
 shortages are a permanent part of all economic systems like the Soviet.
 The specialist might even find it more disturbing if all references to
 shortages among the commodities he watches disappeared from the
 Communist press; the disappearance might be a reflection of tightened
 security, which in turn might suggest some dark intent.  Moreover,
 a confirmed or admitted shortage in a commodity which he h, -td esti-
 mated to be in good supply might move the analyst rather to question
 his previous estimates, all too often based on inadequate sources, than
 to suspect a diversion to military usage.
 Most investigations of bottlenecks as indications turn out like one
 made at the request of a congressional leader who had been told
 that the Soviet purchases of Canadian and U.S. grain reflected very
 high military consumption of alcohol (industrial) rather than a crop
 too small to feed the population.  The gist of the intelligence reply
 was that even if Soviet military use of alcohol exceeded U.S. military
 use by 10 times it would still consume only about three percent of
 Soviet alcohol output, far too little to require large grain: imports.
 In the light of his experience the commodity analyst thus properly
 looks first to the economy rather than to hostile intentions for the ex-
 planation of all shortages.  Even when he cannot find an economic
 explanation he remains reasonably sure that there must be one.  That
 he still looks carefully for indications implications in each new shortage
 does credit to his integrity, for he feels like a man examining clams
 for pearls.
 A myriad of other possible economic events might theoretically pro-
 vide valuable indications information, but limits on collection capabili-
 ties and on the ability to generalize from fragmentary information
 (like data on one activity at one facility at one point in time) severely
 reduce the logical possibilities.
 A large "unknown" area in the potential utility of economic intel-
 ligence for strategic warning is covered by the items in the General
 Indicator List which refer to relocation of plants, increased output in
 armament plants, and changes in the pattern of industrial output.
 The validity of such indicators and to some extent the prospects of

 collecting information on them would depend on what assumptions
 were made as to the kind of war plan the USSR might settle upon.
 There is little precedent in the history of such activities to serve as a
 guide for early warning; some redirection of economic effort occurred
 during (but not before) the Korean war.
 In practice, there are only a few additional economic areas of oc-
 casional concern, even as background, to the NIC and the Watch
 Committee.  Economic developments in the GDR are of considerable
 background value for strategic warning.  In particular, the level of
 interzonal trade has over the past several years been a good gauge of
 the intensity of Communist feeling on the Berlin issue.  Moreover, it
 is difficult to see how the Group of Soviet Forces Germany could be
 put to extended use without the support of the GDR railroad net, which
 is sometimes hard pressed to handle normal loads and therefore could
 not move greatly increased military traffic without cutting off its civil
 customers.
 The varying priorities accorded Communist agriculture are also of
 background value.  For an extreme example, the periods when signifi-
 cant number of troops are engaged in digging potatoes or moving
 wheat seem unlikely to bring war.  At other times the Soviet Union
 is involved in one of its chronic reorganizations of economic adminis-
 tration (such as that being prepared in the fall of 1962), with in-
 evitable disruptive effects on command, output, and supply flows,
 aggravated by infighting for position in the new scheme.  That such a
 reorganization is in progress does not preclude war, of course, but it
 does indicate strongly that the possibility of war is not preempting
 the undivided attention of party and government leaders.
 Construction projects are of occasional concern in early warning.
 Information on important projects is sometimes available with little
 time lag, and analysis of the purpose, priority, and cost of the effort
 may then be of significance.
 Finally, merchant shipping and related information provided in late
 July and early August of 1962 the initial indisputable evidence of a
 drastic modification in Soviet policy on Cuba.  On 29 August the
 Watch Committee concluded that "at the least, recent deliveries in-
 dicate a significant Soviet effort to improve the defensive military
 capabilities of the Cuban regime."  This conclusion was made pos-
 sible primarily by the collectors and collators of information on com-
 mercial maritime shipping.  Were the Soviets again to try such a
 build-up in an overseas location, shipping information might again
 provide strategic warning.
 Some observations on the hazardous
 duty of conveying early warning in
 political and other "soft" areas of
 intelligence.
 ON WARNING
 Keith Clark
 The capabilities of U.S. intelligence have improved markedly in
 the course of the last fifteen years or so, but in the same period ex-
 pectations about what it ought to be able to accomplish have probably
 grown even faster. This is natural enough, and probably professionally
 salutary for those who ply the trade, since most people need de-
 manding requirements to keep them up to the mark.  In any case,
 the government spends a great deal of money to equip itself with
 good intelligence and is rightly impatient with anything less than
 the best.  But the situation does carry irritations and hazards for the
 professional.  It is comparable to that in modern medicine, wherein
 improvement in techniques and medications, by giving rise to an-
 ticipation of consistent success, makes occasional failure a doubly
 grievous matter.
 And by some standards intelligence fails more than occasionally,
 since it is considered in many quarters to have fallen down on the
 job if there takes place anywhere in the world an important, or some-
 times even mildly interesting, political event which it had not heralded
 in advance in a way to make the warning stick in the minds of its con-
 sumers.  We are all familiar with the queries and the resulting search
 of the record to find out whether top officials had been warned of
 such and such a development prior to its occurrence, and if not why.
 The short answer is often that these officials had indeed been warned,
 sometimes repeatedly, but won't admit it.  This is the one likely to
 jump to the tongue of the participant in the post mortem, whether
 intelligence collector, analyst, or estimator: he had reported a week
 or a month ago that coup plotting was afoot in Ruritania and the
 government's position was shaky, so nobody should have been sur-
 prised when it was thrown out last night.
 Whether or not anyone should have been surprised, however,
 the fact is that they often enough were surprised, and so inclined to
 ask why.  Except in a narrow and not very profitable way, the

 analyst or estimator cannot meet the question by pointing out that
 an estimate or a current intelligence daily "covered" yesterday's big
 event when it noted weeks or months ago the possibility of a coup
 in Ruritania.  Too often that report has been forgotten in the
 intervening stream of intelligence issuances and other papers or their
 equivalent in briefing sessions.  Unless the consumer has been in-
 formed recently, and with sufficient emphasis and impact to make
 it stick, he has not in an effective sense been warned.
 The following observations on this subject are intended neither
 as a defense of the intelligence community's record nor as definitive
 analysis and solution of the difficulty.  The problem of crisis antic-
 ipation and early warning will continue with us, I suspect, despite
 the recurrent efforts of this computer age to gear up machines for
 effective and reliable prophecy in these soft areas of intelligence; here
 art, old-fashioned expertise, and a judicious amount of imagination
 still count for more than science.  But while these reflections can
 offer no new secret insights or intellectual breakthrough, it may
 nonetheless be useful in a professional journal to record some guide-
 lines and techniques derived from experience in asking the questions,
 if not always giving the right answers.
 The obvious first consideration is that the world itself is a chancey
 and uncertain place, in which change, sudden or gradual, is more
 the rule than the exception.  One need only compare the world
 today, or any one area of it, with what prevailed 10 years ago to
 get a measure of the flux we live in.  Technology, altering the lives
 and the thinking of men everywhere, has been accelerating the pace
 of even the most massive historical trends, the kind that used to
 take decades to work themselves out.  To take one conspicuous
 example: with some stretching of the historical imagination one can
 imagine a colonial revolt against imperialism getting under way a
 century ago and gaining wide support in various parts of Asia,
 Africa, and Latin America, but one can scarcely picture such a move-
 ment winning hands down, but for a few isolated spots, in little
 more than a decade.  Yet this is what has happened in the last 15
 years, and the accompanying turbulence has generated some of the
 principal problems for U.S. foreign policy and intelligence during
 most of our official careers.                Approved For Release 2005/01/05  CIA-RDP78TO31
 In this world and this period of history, the intelligence analyst
 and his customers are going to be nearer the mark if they think of
 change as more or less constant, and the main question as being
 not whether but when and how it will manifest itself.  Unless proven
 otherwise, it should be assumed that a given society is changing
 daily.  We face a semantic pitfall in the possibility of inferring from
 the overworked term "stable" or "stability" that things are remaining
 static; this attribute is often ascribed to a kind of mere surface calm
 below which change and flux are going on all the time.
 If accepting the fact that change is normal and widespread pre-
 disposes us favorably, it still does not begin to solve the problems
 arising from what we have to work with in forecasting a particular
 change. In most cases the raw material of the evidence is necessarily
 fragmentary and inconclusive, and as it is rounded out it normally
 becomes not the stuff of early warning but news of current events.
 A number of things contribute to the poor quality of evidence on
 future developments.
 One is the sheer impossibility of keeping track of the moves of
 every individual, organization, or government that may be in a
 position to change things in some part of the world.  This difficulty
 is compounded when the success of the move for change depends
 on the ability of the promoters to keep it secret.  If the coup plan
 that gets leaked is the one most likely to be frustrated by its enemies,
 it follows that a lot of such impending moves that have been reported
 either do not come off or go quite differently than anticipated.  No
 one in the early-warning business can afford to overlook such reports
 in his own calculations, but some of them are going to prove ill
 founded by reason of the same lack of secrecy that led to our getting
 them.
 There is also the intrinsic element of caprice in the affairs of men
 and nations.  Some events cannot be predicted because the principals
 seize sudden opportunities to act or are reacting to sudden stimuli,
 unforeseen and quite often unforeseeable by those on the spot.  If the
 participants themselves could not have predicted the turn of events,
 the most sensitive and pervasive of intelligence systems would not be
 likely to do better. It is probably a salutary sign of awareness of such
 limitations that the unanticipated fall of Khrushchev was not followed,
 at least to my knowledge, by stern admonitions to the intelligence
 94AOOO 00030 k0 0ts procedures and sharpen its sense of urgency.

 Shotgun and Pinpoint
 For those charged with intelligence warning there is of course a
 simple and appealing solution to these dilemmas-to point the gun in
 all possible directions.  Warning always of everything gives you a
 technical defense against the charge that you failed to provide warning;
 it is also likely to lose you most of your readers or listeners and beat the
 remainder into a state of permanent hysteria or hopeless apathy.  It
 is doubtful that anyone could be got to read an estimate or current in-
 telligence paper big and fat enough to cover all the dire possibilities,
 and it is certain that the inflationary effect of this course on the value
 of intelligence warning would be ruinous.
 A cardinal principle of effective warning intelligence, then, has to
 be selectivity.  Selectivity involves rejection, and rejection involves
 risk.  If intelligence is to eschew the shotgun approach in the in-
 terests of being read and respected, it will have to pick from the
 voluminous mass of often fragmentary and sometimes contradictory
 data a limited number of items to pass along, and sometimes what it
 rejects will later prove to be important.  The hope is that the
 error will be corrected in time by the receipt of information supple-
 menting or shedding new light on the rejected item and so pro-
 moting it out of the rejection category.  Or perhaps another, better
 or luckier human mind will encounter the same fragment of informa-
 tion and respond more sensitively and perceptively-hopefully well
 in advance of the event it foreshadows.  In the best of circumstances,
 however, selection will occasionally eliminate something that sub-
 sequently proves to have been important stuff.  It is the argument of
 this essay that an occasional miss of this type is preferable to the
 overprudent shotgun alternative.
 Now even a highly selective warning system will have to deal in
 possibilities more often than in probabilities or near-certainties.  Rea-
 sonable prudence requires that a government be prepared, at any given
 moment, to cope or at least live with a number of contingent possi-
 bilities only some of which will in fact materialize.  If something
 could happen, it had better be borne in mind, whether it will "prob-
 ably" happen or not.  This being the case, some fairly substantial
 proportion of the warnings delivered will in the event prove exagger-
 ated or will otherwise not be borne out by subsequent develop-
 ments.  (Sometimes the fact that a warned-of development fails to
 come off may be due to U.S. action triggered by the warning; here
 intelligence has done its job to perfection even as its prophesies fail
 to come true.)
 Errors on the side of caution are less harmful than neglect of
 warning, but they are not harmless.  A false alarm will normally he
 overlooked or forgiven much more easily than a failure to call the
 shot on something that does happen; but both are errors and both
 ought to be on the consciences of those in the warning business.
 Most of us recall with acute pain instances in which intelligence
 failed to forecast something that did occur.  A review of the dan-
 gers and opportunities warned of that did not materialize may give
 less pain but is still sobering.
 Importance
 The area between these two kinds of error thus represents one of
 the criteria in the process of selection-degree of likelihood.  The
 standard is admittedly a fuzzy one.  A second criterion offers some-
 what solider ground, namely the importance of the matter being
 warned of.  It is often, though not always, easier to judge how sig-
 nificantly some contingency would affect our interests than how
 likely it is to occur.  Common sense and a reasonable familiarity
 with the scope of our government's interests and activities usually
 enable us to tell whether some foreseeable event would be of critical,
 great, moderate, little, or no importance to national or departmental
 interests.  In any case the policy makers' judgment on this score can
 supplement our own.
 The complexity and many responsibilities of a government like
 ours suggest that very few foreign developments would fail to be of
 concern to some department or program.  As a criterion for warning
 selection, then, the question of importance probably refers less to
 whether than to whom to warn and how.  Some predictions should
 have top billing in national intelligence publications or briefings,
 others more subdued treatment in departmental or specialized is-
 suances.  The criterion is thus most usefully relevant to selection for
 briefings and publication at the highest levels.
 It is this writer's subjective and purely personal opinion that the
 application of more vigorous standards in this respect would have a
 salutary effect on the bulk and readability, and hence on the impact,
 of most intelligence publications, not excluding the national esti-

 mates.  An urge for completeness and detailed perfection is a good
 thing, but sometimes an inordinate amount of time and energy is
 spent in perfecting presentations of detail which can make no earthly
 difference to policy decisions but confront already overburdened
 readers with more information than they want or need to know. This
 is not an argument for either carelessness or super-finality but a plea
 for the classic virtues of brevity and concentration on the essential
 as still useful in our line of work.
 The criteria of likelihood and importance for determining whether,
 how, and to whom to give early warning are supplemented by a third,
 that of imminence, which is most relevant to the choice of when to
 warn..  This timing is often of critical importance, for policy makers
 arc as human as the rest of us and busier than most.  On the higher
 levels they are subjected to a mentally exhausting barrage of publi-
 cations and briefings on a host of subjects, and in the daily round of
 attending to inescapably urgent things, some of the rest are going
 to be remembered and some are not.
 Selection in the light of imminence is a matter of avoiding un-
 acceptable extremes, warning too early or too late.  Logically it
 might: seem the earlier the better, giving as much time as possible
 to do something about it, but this logic leads to presenting a catalog
 of all kinds of important things that may or are likely to happen
 eventually.  Though it is unquestionably desirable to look ahead, in
 appropriate context, with a general prediction of developments that
 seem ultimately probable, our problem here is a pointed particular
 warning at a time when something can and should be done about it.
 Even the most prudent and forward-looking administration cannot
 give as serious attention to a problem foreseen five years ahead as to
 one shaping up next week.  It is not just that something postponable
 is crowded off the stage by real and present dangers; there is often
 little that can or should be done about some foreseen events until
 they are closer at hand.  There is always the chance that the con-
 tingency will not arise when expected or not at all.
 It is true that in addition to delivering specific warning at the right
 time, intelligence has a responsibility to keep its consumers suffi-
 ciently aware of the remoter contingencies, of what Walt W. Rostow

 degrees easier and conceivably a bit more fruitful.  In an uncertain
 world perhaps we can't ask for much more.

 Some precepts for the practical ap-
 plication of an esoteric art.
 COUNTERINTELLIGENCE INTERROGATION
 C. N. Geschwind
 The general topic of interrogation is a vast one, opening into all
 fields of theoretical and applied psychology and leading at its distant
 limits in one direction to the wellsprings of human nature and in
 another to the roots of political power.  The specialized form we call
 counterintelligence interrogation-that done to secure information on
 a hostile intelligence service and the cooperation of the subject with
 a view to neutralizing it-being a more subtle art than the interroga-
 tion, say, of ordinary prisoners of war or criminal suspects, has ramifi-
 cations almost equally far-reaching.  The ordinary intelligence officer
 cannot begin to master the enormous body of literature on the topic.'
 Because of this and because a really first-class talent for inter-
 rogating-as for managing people in general--is a rarity, what is
 needed as a matter of practical reality is a simplified doctrine and
 standard procedures that officers of average ability can follow.  The
 soaring doctrines of the theorist and the virtuoso have to he brought
 down to earth and confined to what will work for you and me.      This
 kind of simplification has been performed in several guides and man-
 uals.2  What I want to discuss in this article are selected aspects of
 counterintelligence interrogation which have been slighted or in my
 opinion simply require highlighting.
 Managerial Aspects
 It is a peculiar feature of most works on interrogation that they
 begin with the "how to" phase; one starts out in a room face to face
 A good place to sample it is in A Study for Development of Improved Inter-
 rogation Techniques: Study SR 117-D, by Albert D. Biderman of the Bureau of
 Social Science Research, Inc., with its bibliography of hundreds of references.
 This is the final report, March 1959, on contract AF 18 (600) 1797, monitored
 by the Rome Air Development Center with technical assistance from the Air Force

 with the subject, all ready to interrogate him.  In reality, many things
 have to be done before we reach that point. The following para-
 graphs cite some of them.
 The need.  First of all we have to decide whether the subject
 actually has to be interrogated.  Like a marriage, a CI interrogation
 should not he embarked upon unless it is unavoidable.  Does the
 subject really know enough to be worth while?  Can he do something
 useful for us if we swing him around?  Would some other subject
 be better worth our time?
 In answering these questions, we have to keep in mind our purpose,
 at least latent in most CI interrogations, of getting the subject to col-
 laborate with us, later, perhaps in an entrapment or double-agent
 operation, perhaps for example by surfacing hostile operations or
 testifying in court.  We have to guard against a very natural desire
 to get the truth out of someone just because we want to prove some-
 thing or satisfy our curiosity.  It takes just as long and costs just as
 much to interrogate a bum as it does to lay open the secrets of an
 opposition case officer who has defected.
 Now there will be times when we do not know enough about a
 subject to decide whether he is worth interrogating or not.  We should
 get the facts-by file checks, other investigation, screening assess-
 ments, etc.-before we render a decision.  In this connection, it is
 important to bear in mind that some agent handlers have a tendency to
 push their disposal or discipline problems into interrogation channels.
 Those in charge of interrogations should be careful never to buy a
 pig in a poke, or act until they have reviewed whatever operational
 files there are.
 Control.  A second thing to be established is the control situation.
 Authorities vary on many points in interrogation doctrine, but they
 are all agreed on one: the better the control, the better the outlook
 for success. A man firmly behind bars can be put under a good
 deal more control than one we meet in a safe house, not to mention
 his own home.  Though obvious, this is often overlooked.
 We should therefore catalog, in writing, the factors of control which
 we have and those we can develop.  Can we jail the man?  Can we
 convince him that we can?  Could he flee across the border, or would
 he face a worse fate there? Are his emotional treasures (family, etc.)
 where we can reach them?   What hard evidence have we in docu-
 ments or witnesses?  Are we free to use it?  These and many other
 questions must be studied.

 Bargaining position.  In every interrogation there is an overt or
 tmacitns
 ogaining situation, and the quid pro is the single most potent
 eabarf
 moving the subject to action.  Are we going to pay for his
 information?  What can we do for him if he collaborates?  Will he
 face jail if he does not?  How can we protect him from retaliation?
 What can we do about his special problems?  Before entering upon
 interrogation we must be quite clear as to what offers may be made
 or implied and what may not.
 Care and feeding.  It should always be settled in advance where
 the subject will be housed and under what conditions, where he will
 be fed, how his laundry will be handled, where he can go and what
 he can do for amusement, what medical care will be available, who
 will provide transport, where he can get religious ministration, etc.
 Security.  We do not need to be reminded about protecting our
 security from the subject, but what about his security?  Will he be
 quartered out of sight from the public?  How can he be transported
 securely? flow will he be guarded?  Can he go out nights?  Will
 he be supplied with funds and documentation to protect him? How
 and for how long can he remain away from his regular haunts with-
 out attracting hostile attention?  What cover can be arranged for
 our contact with him?  A CI interrogation differs from most other
 types in the critical respect that we may wish to keep it completely
 secret, not only to protect ourselves and him but to safeguard opera-
 tional potentials and values that may be derived from him-potentials
 of which we may have no inkling until we are well along in the
 interrogation.
 Covert aids.  We should have firm plans on whether and how to
 introduce stool pigeons among the subject's associates, whether to
 read his mail, surreptitiously search his belongings and quarters, put
 eavesdropping devices in his vicinity, put him under surveillance, and
 so on.
 Manpower.  There is the question of what interrogators are to be
 reserved-one might say expended.  How much time will they have?
 Will they have suitable facilities? What help will they have?  Are
 they actually up to handling the subject?  Will the polygraph be
 made available? How much control of it will the interrogator have?
 Are recording devices on hand?
 Legalities.  The basic paper work often turns out to be

 the right to interrogate this particular subject and why.  It is well
 to secure some agreement in writing from him also, if only a security
 agreement.  Most subjects can be talked into signing some sort of
 paper.  There must be a clear-cut understanding of how the local
 law or legal officials fit into the picture.  After the subject has com-
 plained to the district attorney is the wrong time to think about this
 aspect.
 Females.  Female subjects, whether young or old, require special
 handling not only because they are more difficult to interrogate but
 because they can cause scandals.  If female interrogators are not
 available, a witness, possibly through a mirror-window, should always
 be arranged.  Neglect of this point can lead to extremely painful
 incidents.
 Interpreters. The use of interpreters poses many problems.  In
 professional work there should he someone listening in at least from
 time to time to report what the interpreter is really saying. The
 availability and the ability of interpreters should be determined in
 advance.
 Concurrent research.  It would be nice to have an interrogator who
 knew all the topics of the interrogation as well as the subject did, but
 in most cases the interrogator's knowledge will be deficient in one or
 more respects.  He may therefore not recognize the significance of
 certain information the source provides or could provide, may waste
 valuable time getting information that is already well known, may
 misinterpret information, or may not even reach a common under-
 standing with the subject on what they are talking about.  Every
 interrogator, however well informed, has blind spots and therefore
 needs to have his "take" reviewed concurrently, while the subject is
 available to supply further or clarifying data.
 This means that concurrent research support should be arranged,
 if not at the site of the interrogation then near enough that the inter-
 rogator can have the drafts of his reports reviewed daily and can
 discuss the trend of the interrogation with one or more competent
 analysts.  In practice, unfortunately, the U.S. services have been so
 organized that the consumer-analysts are far away and first see the
 interrogation reports long after both subject and interrogator are busy
 with other things.
 Spot interrogation.  Many times the subject is available only at
 intervals-a border crosser, a possible double agent, a defector who

 has steady employment elsewhere, a prisoner of the police to whom
 access is but fleeting, or some person whose contact with its must
 be concealed.  In such cases the planning must be especially thorough
 and details of questions well worked out with the help of the best
 analysts available.
 Supervision. The interrogator must of course be alone with his
 subject a good deal of the time, and he must have a wide latitude in
 dealing with him.  He may spend quite a bit of time discussing trivia
 without necessarily being out of line.  He cannot do his job with some-
 one breathing down his neck.  The simplest means of supervision,
 short of closed-circuit TV, is a microphone in the interrogation room,
 so that when the supervisor is minded and has time he can listen in
 to what is going on.  This is a good way to keep interrogators on
 their toes and keep some track of the development of the interrogation.
 The mirror-window (if suitably camouflaged, as in a medicine cabinet)
 is also a big help.
 Communications.  A one-way telephone is most helpful, one that
 does not ring but can be used by the interrogator for outgoing calls.
 A light and buzzer system to show when the corridors are free and
 enable the interrogator to call for assistance or block the corridor is
 one of a number of refinements that can be elaborated at an interroga-
 tion center but are usually too costly for smaller setups.
 Comforts.  It is important to be sure the refreshment facilities are
 adequate.  Toilets, snacks, coffee, etc., must be handy and controlled
 by the interrogator without his having to leave the subject alone.
 Disposal.  Planning should be quite concrete on what is to become
 of the subject after the interrogation is over.  Provision for the sign-
 ing of receipts, quit-claims, security and recontact agreements, etc.
 should be made in advance; you can't tell when an interrogation
 may suddenly be terminated.
 Conversion.  It will almost always be a major objective to win the
 cooperation of the subject at least to the extent of maintaining secrecy.
 Is your interrogator able to argue ideologies?  Can he handle the
 man in such a way as to win his allegiance?   These are matters to
 have in hand before the struggle begins.
 The golden rule of counterintelligence interrogation is take care of
 the housekeeping before the how-to part, being sure that everything
 is as efficient, secure, dignified, and impressive as you can possibly
 make it.

 The Interrogator Job
 It is a truism to say that most men who have the ability to handle
 interrogation have more sense than to want to.  In many ways the
 interrogator has become a forgotten man of intelligence and counter-
 intelligence, looked upon as a question-machine and seldom given
 adequate career prospects.  The work is just about the hardest there
 is, for it includes the two separate jobs of questioning people and
 writing reports.  And it is of key importance: interrogation and in-
 vestigation are the twin pillars of counterintelligence.
 The Communist services have provided the most elaborate interro-
 gation careers and facilities procurable.  They rely very heavily upon
 interrogation not only to get facts but to grind people down to their
 specifications.  Successful interrogators can look forward to positions
 of increased importance.  One East German, a certain Gustav Szinda,
 who used to beat subjects up first and ask questions afterward, with
 the twin objectives of knocking them off balance and convincing
 them that he meant it when he threatened violence, eventually
 wound up as chief of a provincial headquarters of his service.  Others
 have been given such positions as chief of operations and illegal
 rezident abroad.  The Communists consider interrogation training
 to be the building of a fundamental skill, and a successful interrogator
 they seem to look upon as so heavily compromised to the regime as
 to be trusted on foreign missions.
 We, on the other hand, seem to have made the job a drudge assign-
 ment which does not lead anywhere.  The easiest way out of this
 dangerous situation would be to make a half-year or so of interrogation
 duty routine in the development of all officers who aspire to run
 secret agents.  This would yield a reservoir of interrogators for any
 situation, train agent handlers in the skills of questioning and
 reporting, strongly reinforce their knowledge of counterintelligence
 topics, foreign languages, hostile thinking, etc., and at the same time
 provide manpower with motivation to handle the presently much
 neglected basic job of interrogation.
 In any case, those upon whom the interrogation task is laid require
 more than routine good handling; they have to be made to feel that
 their work is appreciated and the greatest care taken to steer their
 careers away from blind alleys.  Above all, one must see to it that
 unimportant or curiosity interrogations are not imposed upon experi-
 enced men; nothing is so demoralizing to an interrogator as to
 struggle with worthless subjects to get a product that will soon find
 its way into the classified trash.  As good sources become scarce, pres-
 sure develops to fish out marginal ones and dubious individuals such
 as fabricators for the sake of producing some kind of report.  Con-
 sistent resort to this practice risks killing the goose that lays the
 golden eggs.
 The best protection against such misuse is to give established
 interrogators the responsibility for assessing and evaluating their
 sources.  If an interrogator says a subject shows signs of mental
 aberrations or other deficiencies or is worthless in point of knowledge,
 his judgment should be accepted unless there are very important
 reasons for overriding it.  In the latter case these should be candidly
 explained.  If at all possible, interrogators should function in groups
 or as a staff led by a senior interrogator.  This is a great morale-
 builder and stimulant to productive competition.
 The how of Interrogation
 The general successfulness of interrogators in eliciting compliance makes for
 a difficulty in analyzing scientifically the bases of their effectiveness.  A high
 rate of success is apparently achieved by many different kinds of personalities,
 employing a wide variety of methods, on the basis of assumptions and lines
 of reasoning which, to the extent that they are articulated at all, are fre-
 quently unfounded or mutually incompatible s
 It seems to me that this finding is substantially correct.  That is
 to say there are all sorts of people and all sorts of approaches that
 work.                                  There is no best way.  There are not even many general rules.
 People are complex, variable, and vulnerable or invulnerable at the
 most unexpected points.  More important, depending on the person
 doing the interrogation and the personal equation that evolves be-
 tween him and the subject, the vulnerabilities may change.  An
 elderly woman, for example, may develop a strong interest in im-
 pressing a personable young male interrogator and entirely reject
 another elderly woman.   On the other hand, she may refuse to talk
 at all except to another woman in the same age bracket. Many
 people, of course, make adaptations, so that an interrogator not
 basically compatible with the subject assigned him may soon get
 along swimmingly.
 The tricks and tactics of interrogation worked out by generations
 of interrogators can be found in many books; all of them have
 validity some of the time.  There are many tomes on how to assess

 the vulnerabilities of subjects, mostly in rather abstruse psychological
 language.  What it all boils down to is that what works with one
 person may not work with another.
 It seems to me that we have again to fall back heavily on what
 are in the main the managerial aspects.  We have to arrange a suit-
 able setting and props in accordance with the role to be given the
 subject in our interrogation psychodrama.  Is he to play the role of
 a captured spy?  A fellow conspirator?   A terrified victim?  A hero?
 An oracle?  A being entitled to every consideration and protection?
 A suspect?  Is he to change roles, and if so when and how?  When
 we have a controlled situation, we have enormous power to force a
 role upon the subject because we can manipulate his environment.
 Unless our subject is highly sophisticated, he will hardly realize
 he is being offered a part to play.  He may, of course, seek to play
 a part: of his own, but if we have assessed him and the situation
 correctly and approach him skillfully, we can fairly easily maneuver
 him at least to take one of two roles we prefer.  Insensibly he drifts
 into the part and begins to respond as if he were the person repre-
 sented in that role.
 In counterintelligence interrogation, no matter where we start we
 want at the end to have our subject playing the same role-the
 oracle; this is the pose that makes him as productive as a gusher.
 We can hardly start with it if he is recalcitrant, but we can lead
 toward it from the beginning by getting him to pontificate on trivia
 and harmless matters.  The best interrogators-sometimes uncon-
 sciously-all head in that direction.
 The worst interrogators are those who (usually unconsciously)
 want to be the heroes of the drama themselves and so beat the sub-
 ject (mentally) to the ground.  The interrogator must firmly suppress
 all impulses to dramatize himself, unless for the purpose of arousing
 the subject to compete.  He can boast of his own operational achieve-
 ments, for example, and quite possibly get a recalcitrant subject to
 top his story.
 We must decide early on whether we are going to interrogate on
 many topics and in detail or only on a few or superficially.  When
 we are in for a long siege, the managerial aspects become very im-
 portant indeed, and the problems of writing, accuracy, concurrent
 research, and keeping the subject productive become more difficult.
 If we confine ourselves to a few topics-relatively rare in counter-
 intelligence interrogation-we need not expect too much trouble with
 the source once he has been made productive.

 Some Approaches
 Making the subject productive is the first goal of any interrogation,
 and it can be reached, as we have said, by many avenues.  The prob-
 lem may range from coping with open hostility to working around
 mental blocks.  In a paper of this length we had better concentrate
 on ways of transforming a recalcitrant subject into an oracle, and
 of these on a few that are not covered in nearly every work on inter-
 rogation.  The following are some that have proved profitable.
 Hypnotism.  In a legal and control situation where chemical or
 natural hypnotism can be induced by qualified practitioners, its value
 does not lie in questioning an entranced subject.  You get worthless
 suggestion-results, fabrications, and distortions. What it can do is
 enable you to change the subject's attitude toward the interrogation.
 Ile can he made to see foes as friends (a good CI interrogator of
 course is never a foe, but only a man who wants to get the subject
 on his side), and post-hypnotic suggestion can often make him co-
 operative after he is out of his trance.
 The polygraph.  This machine is the stethoscope of interrogators,
 used in diagnosis of areas of deception.  It is also a fabulous stalking
 horse, offering the interrogator many openings to give the subject
 an excuse for not holding out any longer.
 The ideological argument.  Every interrogator should be prepared
 to refute tenets of Communism such as that the end justifies the means.
 The ideological line vis-a-vis a subject, however, should not be to
 prove him wrong but to provide him with rationalizations which
 he can use to justify to himself his changing sides (which every
 person to some extent wants to do).
 The quid pro quo.  Cl officers are sometimes in a position to make
 substantial offers to a recalcitrant subject-protection, a chance to
 "work against the Communists on our side," etc.  Backstopped and
 approved on the proper level, such inducements can occasionally
 shortcut weeks of effort.  Quite a few subjects who do not want
 to say so are actually very much interested in "what's in it for me."
 Threats.  Threats to turn the subject over to local authorities, to
 return him to the Communists, of blacklisting, public exposure,
 solitary confinement, deprivations, deportation, confiscation of prop-
 erty, physical violence, etc. are dangerous instruments, for if they
 fail of their effect it usually means the loss of irre      b1

 having been cleared beforehand on the highest level.  The fear ele-
 ment can be stimulated easily and safely by manipulating the situation
 in such a way as to imply the threat.
 If threats arc employed, it should always be implied that the sub-
 ject himself is to blame-"you leave us no choice but to ...'  He
 should never be ordered to comply "or else."  Readers familiar with
 the Jaitner case will recall that he was told he left us no choice but
 to blacklist him everywhere.  This potent threat to his swindling
 future brought him almost at once around to an agreement to tell
 us the truth now if we would keep quiet and not bar him from future
 deceptions.  Essentially the threat is the basis for a quid pro quo.
 One should always be prepared to carry out an explicit threat, for the
 subject will generally sense a bluff.
 Confrontation.     There is a strong temptation, when we are in
 possession of hard evidence such as a witness, documents, or self-
 contradiction, to face the subject with it.  Certainly in many cases it
 becomes necessary eventually to use this type of ammunition openly,
 but the moment should be put off until all else has failed, always until
 after our advantage has been used in polygraph tests or a decision
 made not to run any.  There is nothing so valuable to interrogators
 as having a question on which the subject is known to lie, especially
 when he has no idea that we know it.
 A woman agent of the East German MfS, for example, was observed
 shoplifting by our surveillants.  In the general polygraph examina-
 tion she was casually asked whether she stole things, and the resultant
 reaction became an invaluable gauge.  Later interrogated on the
 same point, she almost immediately admitted it; if this had happened
 before the polygraph test the effect would have been lost.  Coming
 as it did, the confession was the turning point in the interrogation,
 proving an entering wedge for other detailed admissions.
 In the instructions issued by Communist services to their agents
 there is usually a section on what to do under interrogation. They
 are told to stick to their story and try to find out what evidence there
 is against them, and particularly to be alert for anything indicating
 who has betrayed them.  It is well to hear this in mind in surfacing
 evidence in the confrontation maneuver or in the "we know every-
 thing" ploy.
 Divide-and-conquer tactic.  Whenever two or more persons are
 under interrogation on the same topic, for example two agents from
 the same network, the opportunity aril pprdve 1 For Release 2005/01/05  CIA-

 other, not only as sources of detail exposing and refuting cover stories
 and other lies, but also as levers.  A clever interrogator can get the
 idea across to each subject that the other is leaking, especially if he
 has reliable derogatory information he can let slip into his question-
 ing.                                                                                                             In the still hours of the night, when the subject is free to mull
 over the day's exchange, he will stumble on the "slips" and their
 significance, with very weakening effect on his morale.
 Harassment.  Three things very hard on a subject are to have to
 go back over the same ground, to change abruptly from topic to topic,
 and to be interrogated at irregular intervals, say once at dawn, an-
 other time at midnight, etc.  They are particularly effective if done
 under the pretense of "emergencies in which your help is needed"
 rather than as a hostile measure.  But harassment which goes so far
 as to impair the functioning of the subject's nervous system reduces
 his capacity to provide accurate and complete information.  All
 harassment and threats build up the subject's sense of moral superi-
 ority and so his resources for resistance.
 Isolation.  We often find that resistant subjects are kept in com-
 pounds with open-mesh fences, windows, etc. which allow them
 visual contact with the outside world.  In some cases they have been
 allowed to listen to broadcasts or receive newspapers.  Resisters draw
 great strength from this.  They should be isolated visually and in
 every other way, so that they come to regard the prison as their world
 and gradually respond to the fully controlled environment.
 Violence.  There is little doubt that violence, correctly applied,
 often gets crude results quickly; but it lowers the moral caliber of
 the organization employing it and soon corrupts the interrogation staff,
 which degenerates until it cannot operate without violence.  There
 are many more powerful persuaders, and violence should never be
 used.
 Miscellaneous Considerations
 Most of the following topics are each worth a book to themselves;
 here we arc only hitting a few points where an interrogation can be
 helped or hurt.
 Questionnaires.  It should be a function of the concurrent research
 analysts to work out as thoroughgoing a biographic questionnaire as
 possible, so that a junior interrogator, if no one else is available, can
 get down the main facts on which the interrogation plan will have

 Approved F&tW   &2005/01/05 : Cl
 to be based.  The standard Personal Information Report forms in
 use are inadequate but far better than nothing.  Special questionnaires
 should also be devised to cover each main topic. By using question-
 naires we do risk stereotyping the questioning process, but we gain so
 much in the way of systematic coverage that the disadvantage is
 trivial.  This is hard work that has to be done before the subject
 has even been contacted.  It is a staff job.
 Subject assessment.  Tomes have been written on how to deter-
 mine the character of individuals, their strengths, interests, weaknesses
 etc.  It remains a fact that the best clue to the future behaviour of
 any man is his past performance.  The more you can find out about
 the subject's past reactions in situations which confronted him with
 unpleasant choices and problems, the better you can determine who
 should interrogate him and can plan the interrogation tactics.  It is
 quite beyond this paper to get into details on this enormous topic.
 The plethora of aids is confusing.  If you have psychiatric assist-
 ance it may prove quite valuable.  The polygraph can be used as an
 assessment tool.  So can handwriting analysis.  Direct interviews,
 batteries of tests, etc., all have some validity.  But the situation is
 often the determining factor.
 Thus a basically dishonest millionaire would scarcely ever be a
 thief because he has no need to steal, while an honest man faced
 with necessity can perform quite spectacular larcenies.  A weakling
 being asked to divulge information when it would mean death for a
 beloved child will put up a hell of a battle, while a hardnosed fighter
 type may be quite easily induced to cooperate in exchange for a
 fortune or the chance to do in a personal enemy.  It is accordingly
 illusory to devote too much time to assessing a subject's inherent
 resistance potential.
 Far more important is to select an interrogator whose personal
 equation meshes with the subject's.  And that is easily done by trying
 out a few people in harmless personal interviews. Most of us have
 the gift of being able to tell whether we like and are liked by given
 individuals.  Another very important thing is to be sure to determine
 whether the subject can in fact tell an accurate story about anything.
 Some criminals with jail experience habitually put out a screen of
 confusing tales on any and all topics when confronted by authorities.
 Such people can often be trapped by stool pigeons.
 Clues on bona fides.  Only detailed research and investigation can
 confirm bona fides.  There are, however, some warning signs that
 Approved For Release 2005/01/05 :
 SECRET
 -RDP78T03194AQAQ-$@@,Q1$Q,001-0
 should be looked for.  Subjects who use or understand jargon. they
 could not know unless they were "hep" should be trapped with more
 jargon, provocation, etc.  Subjects who defend one or another aspect
 of Communist doctrine while disavowing Communist affiliations should
 always be viewed with suspicion.  Subjects with a fund of "guard-
 house lawyer" talk, like those who do not seem to be able to tell a
 straight story about anything, are often found to have had extensive
 criminal involvement.  Subjects who get off on side issues in great
 detail but are brief on certain central matters are worried about the
 latter.
 Pocket litter.  Never forget to turn out all pockets, cuff linings, etc.
 and where possible conduct a full body search.  Make sure the subject
 gets a chance to explain each item.
 The interrogation plan.  This should be made by the interrogator
 and approved by the supervisor.  It should include deadlines.  Never
 start without one.
 Story building.  As far as possible, the first interrogation should
 be conducted as if it were the last, with detail piled on detail. It is
 not a good idea to have different people give the subject "`once over
 lightly" treatments. As he tells and re-tells his story lie will develop
 it, plug loopholes, resolve contradictions, add corroborative detail,
 learn how to talk under questioning, etc., making the job of the detailed
 interrogator and the breaking of recalcitrance harder and harder.
 Some subjects even begin to believe their own lies.
 Commanders should politely but firmly resist the efforts of visiting
 firemen to "get immediate information on a few important points"
 while the detailed interrogation is postponed.  If there is need for
 haste on particular matters, as in order to get evidence for making
 arrests, this interrogation should be done, in detail, by the assigned
 interrogator.  The visiting firemen can if need be sit (or better just
 listen) in, but it is a very bad error to let them take over unless
 political considerations have precedence.  These smash-and-grab art-
 ists not only contaminate the subject by providing him with all sorts
 of information in their efforts to get immediate answers but also put
 him in the position of being able to say much later, when cornered:
 "Oh that, why I told the big man with the white mustache all about
 that--didn't he tell you?"
 Recording hints.  Full tape recordings are usually useless because
 they include too man  preliminary and clarifying verbal exchanges

 and other confused matter.  Cut the recorder in while you summarize
 out loud, paragraph by paragraph, what the subject has just said,
 asking him to confirm or correct you.  This greatly reduces volume
 and error and in effect gives you the first draft of your report.
 Reporting hints.  All interrogation reports, unless they have been
 fully verified by research, should be labeled "Unevaluated Informa-
 tion."        They should distinguish carefully between what the subject
 has directly observed, what he has heard, and what he deduces, e.g.,
 "Subject infers, because of so and so, that ...."  The interrogator's
 comment should always be carried in footnotes, never inserted in the
 body of the report.  If the results of research and check-ups such as
 confirmatory name-traces are to be mentioned, they too should appear
 as footnotes.  There should also be a statement informing the reader
 how much confirmatory research was done; otherwise a heavily an-
 notated report will give the impression of having been fully researched
 although only aspects of a pivotal nature (or those interesting the
 interrogator) had been checked out.
 Maps and plans. Beware of letting the subject have maps or build-
 ing plans to work with until he has drawn what he can from memory.
 Nothing suits a fabricator better than to get a .map thrust into his
 hands from which to give verisimilitude to his lies about installations,
 escape routes, etc.  When the subject has produced his memory work
 the comparison with maps and plans will yield many interesting
 insights.
 Questions on organization and functions.  The rarest of birds is a
 man who really knows how his organization is set up and functions.
 It is well to be very careful in taking any subject's say-so, no matter
 how sincere and confident he is, on how his outfit works.  The best
 safeguard is to do detailed biographical and job interrogations con-
 cerning all his colleagues; then do an organization and function inter-
 rogation; then examine whether the job descriptions of individuals
 confirm the organic picture.
 Two-man teams.  A prolific source is a heavy burden on a single
 interrogator.  It is not extravagant but highly efficient to use two
 interrogators alternately on different topics, one questioning while
 the other is off writing up what he has gleaned, so that the subject
 is kept continuously occupied.  This not only leaves no time for
 idling and brooding but introduces a measure of variety and com-
 petition into the interrogation process.
 Operational officers as interrogators.  Their use is often unavoidable,
 as in handling double agents.  It is poor practice to use them for
 ordinary interrogations, both because it ties up specialized manpower
 and because no operational officer can be expected to buckle down
 to detailed interrogation work not directly affecting his own operation.
 Interrogator training.  Other things being equal, it is better to get
 people who are interrogators more or less by nature and inclination.
 The training really has to be done on the job.  It is possible to lecture
 and give it dry-run, ground-school type of training, with each mar,
 interrogating a fellow student and being in turn interrogated (the
 latter aspect is often overlooked); but the best results and the quickest
 assessment of ultimate suitability are obtained by putting the man to
 work interrogating real but second-class subjects.  Sometimes arrange-
 ments can be made to assign candidates to local security or police
 interrogation work for a few months.
 CI background.  No interrogator will be useful or productive unless
 he has had full CI operations training and experience and acquires an
 extensive and detailed knowledge of the organization, functions, per-
 sonnel, tactics, methods, etc. of the Communist services against
 which he is to work.
 Indigenous interrogators.  As a rule, these will have a great deal
 of trouble winning the confidence of indigenous subjects, who gen-
 erally distrust their countrymen's security and resent the imposition
 of a mere fellow countryman's will.  If they have to be used, their
 original motivation should gradually be reinforced, as by inducing
 them to apply for U.S, citizenship and providing a career path that
 leads to attractive goals.  One should make sure that they are soon
 moved on to other and better work, not left stuck in an interroga-
 tion rut.
 The interrogator's attitude.  The most important single attribute
 every successful interrogator appears to have is an inflexible determina-
 tion to get the facts.  Persons who quail at difficulties, look for fast
 and easy solutions, are lazy, have turned out to be misfits in other
 jobs, etc. should not be disposed of into the interrogation team.
 They will not only lower morale but be the cause of costly failures.
 When the recalcitrant subject meets with an interrogator who he
 senses is absolutely determined, his resistance is invariably weakened.
 And the subject soon perceives the caliber of the man who faces him.

 Never forget that some day the subject may have an opportunity to
 tell his side of the story to the press or other public medium, friendly

 MORE ON THE RECRUITMENT OF SOVIETS
 Martin L. Brabourne
 Andrew J. Twiddy's "Recruitment of Soviet Officials" 1 came as an
 invigorating breath of fresh air to at least one much interested reader,
 combining a realistic appraisal of one of our key intelligence tasks
 and an unenchanted review of past efforts with an original and
 optimistic approach to the future.  Its community-wide dissemination
 in the Studies was also a forward move in striking the keynote, so to
 speak, for a renewed and broader examination of Soviet recruitments
 which would lift the subject out of its status as the arcane, esoteric
 specialty of a selected few.  It is not out of disagreement with Mr.
 Twiddy but stimulated by his refreshing treatment that this reader
 has tried to organize and pull together his own parallel thoughts
 and experiences in the hope of continuing the conversation, the
 "thinking out loud" that Twiddy began.  He believes he has some-
 thing to say, and perhaps this may in turn stimulate others to join
 the discussion.
 The Vulnerable Target
 We have for years studied so-called "vulnerabilities," the "basis for
 recruitment," the "motivation of defection," and so on, and there is no
 question
 ffthat we have learned something from these studies.  That
 ou eorts have somehow been wide of the mark, however, is indi-
 cated by the consistent failure of operational approaches based. on the
 studies.  It may be that we have lost sight of the forest, or perhaps
 more appropriately have failed, in our wandering among the trees, to
 perceive that we are in a forest at all.  What we are looking for is so
 evident, so perfectly obvious, that in a sense it has escaped our notice.
 This single, simple, self-evident observation is that the enormous
 act of defection, of betrayal, treason, is almost invariably the act of
 a warped, emotionally maladjusted personality.  It is compelled by a
 fear, hatred, deep sense of grievance, or obsession with revenge far

 exceeding in intensity these emotions as experienced by normal,
 reasonably well-integrated and well-adjusted persons. Defection is
 atypical, and continued betrayal even more so: of the thousands,
 even tens of thousands of Soviets who have served abroad since say
 1950, only a few dozen have defected, and of these only a few have
 worked in place for us as agents. Such acts in peacetime are clearly
 a manifestation of abnormal psychology; a normal, mature, emotionally
 healthy person, deeply embedded in his own ethnic, national, cultural,
 social, and family matrix, just doesn't do such things.2
 This general principle is illustrated in our experience with Soviet
 defectors,  All of them have been lonely people.  All of those in the
 writer's experience have manifested some serious behavior problem-
 such as alcoholism, satyriasis, morbid depression, a psychopathic
 pattern of one type or another, an evasion of adult responsibility-
 which was adequate evidence for an underlying personality defect
 decisive in their defection.3  It is only a mild hyperbole to say that
 no one can consider himself a Soviet operations officer until he has
 gone through the sordid experience of holding his Soviet "friend's"
 head while he vomits five days of drinking into the sink.4
 What is the evident corollary of this proposition?  Simply stated,
 it is that our operational efforts should be focussed against the emo-
 tionally weak, immature, and disturbed fringe elements of a Soviet
 colony.  Systematic fishing in these troubled waters should have a
 much higher probability of yield, over a period of time, than un-
 focussed, indiscriminate efforts such as have been made in the past.
 This is the principle that has been so obvious as to escape notice.
 2 The truth of this generalization is today adequately recognized in overt
 academic, journalistic, and literary works.  Of the many references that could be
 given, Rebecca West's Meaning of Treason comes to mind, and William L. Shirer's
 The Traitor.  From a psychoanalytical standpoint there is Robert Lindner's
 Prescription for Rebellion.  A sociological treatment, and the best one for our
 own systematic study and understanding, is Morton Grozdin's The Loyal and the
 Disloyal (University of Chicago, 1956).
 a Our classified literature has finally recognized this fact, and articles in this
 journal have reflected the hard-earned lesson.  See, for example, "What to Do
 with Defectors" by John Ankerbrand, Studies V 4, p. 33 if.
 ' We shall not attempt an analysis of the degree to which this post-defection
 behavior may reflect guilt and remorse for the act of defection.  Suffice it here
 to observe that psychiatric study of several of these defectors identified the alco-
 holic manifestations as merely one symptom of lon -standing  er onalit  difticultie
 of which the defection itself was another.     XpproVe(~ I-or R elease 2005/01/05: C
 Given the principle, a number of conditions must be satisfied before
 it can be translated into an operational program.  First is the ques-
 tion whether it is possible to recognize and identify these fringe ele-
 ments by means of traditional and existing sources of information,.  Do
 sources normally available to us produce the kind of clues which
 would at least tentatively identify such potential targets?  If so, the
 next step is to isolate and catalog these clues, criteria, and indicators
 of our targets.  That done, case officers and analysts have to be
 sensitized to recognize the indicators, have to develop the outlook
 and sophistication to seize on them in their observations and report
 them.  Finally, access must be gained to the targets so identified, and
 officers must learn how to talk to them.
 Target Characteristics
 An intelligence officer once observed that the only reliable motiva-
 tion for treasonable espionage is hatred and thirst for revenge.  Else--
 where it has been said that most traitors have been impelled to their
 treason by dreams of power and glory.  Who are the people that
 hate and seek revenge with such passion they commit treason? Who
 are the people that dream of power and glory and, not only frustrated
 in these dreams but perhaps even ridiculed in their daily lives, be-
 come so bitter as to turn their backs on family, friends, and nation?
 It is necessary at this point to go into a little amateur (and vastly
 oversimplified) psychology.  In this writer's opinion, the persons we
 are seeking are those with a markedly deficient or defective con-
 science-the psychopaths, also called sociopaths-and at the other
 end of the spectrum those who may have an adequate (or perhaps
 overdeveloped) conscience but are hampered in their life and work
 by intense internal conflicts-neurotic and prepsychotic personalities.
 The psychopath is a person basically without scruples or one whose
 weak or defective conscience is eroded by the problems and frustra-
 tions of living and finally collapses under their intolerable accurnula-
 tion.  Sometimes a deceptively charming and seemingly well-adjusted
 person, he can also be an easily recognizable misfit, an intrigant, a
 con man, a chiseler.  He is highly self-centered, even if he hides it
 with some degree of success.  He is impulsive, with a low frustration
 tolerance, hypersensitive, easily angered.  He has an enormous need
 for prestige, status, recognition.  He is often highly arrogant.  Ile

 mum damage or in indiscriminate destructive retaliation, a blind
 lashing out.  Sgt. Dunlap, Col. Penkovskiy, Joe Valachi, Aaron Burr,
 Rastvorov, George Blake, and Lee Oswald almost certainly belong co
 this type.  Eleazar Lipsky has written a highly perceptive fictional
 account of such a person in his story The Scientist, which is well worth
 reading.   Another by the same author is Kiss of Death, presenting a
 fictional precursor of Joe Valachi.
 The neurotic and prepsychotic are different from the psychopath,
 but equally interesting from an operations standpoint.  Here we have
 emotional constellations characterized by inner conflicts, anxieties, and
 severe repressions or distortions of particular facets of the personality.
 It is to this category that Morton Grozdin's "alienated" personality
 belongs.  The neurotic or prepsychotic has difficulty getting along
 in life; in severe cases he is immobilized in his job or perhaps in his
 family relations.  He may be severely repressed, or over-organized
 and rigid (the Puritan, for example).  His ability to understand and
 gel: along with other people is characteristically poor.  He is pre-
 occupied with his own problems.  He loses contact with other people
 to varying degrees, and he acutely feels need for such contact, for com-
 munication and affection.  He will be over-dependent or over-
 aggressive.  His personality distortions cause his unsatisfied needs to
 he experienced with much greater intensity than in "normal" people,
 and it is these overwhelmingly intense feelings which can provide
 the driving power for defection and espionage.'
 Whether the neurotic/prepsychotic is overly dependent (often shy,
 withdrawn, even isolated), or overly aggressive, obnoxious, and up-
 staging, he retains the opposite tendency repressed, driven out of sight,
 so to speak, with greater or less success.  A highly dependent person
 thus has strongly repressed hostility and unsatisfied aggressive needs,
 while the highly aggressive ones have rigidly suppressed dependency
 needs and are often most lonely persons.    The suppressed tendency,
 whether to dependency or aggression, often splashes over into overt
 behavior, giving the outside observer an impression of inconsistency,
 "spottiness," or instability of character.
 ' The force of these drives was well illustrated by an incident in the writer's
 handling of a defector.  The defector was being "dried out" from one of his
 periodic alcoholic bouts and had been placed under sedation.  The doctor ad-
 ministered about ten times the dosage normally sufficient to knock a person cold.
 This massive dosage failed to put him to sleep, however; it merely "slowed him
 down."                                          Approved For Release 2005/01/05 : Cl

 Recruitment
 Neurotic and prcpsychotic persons are characteristically unable to
 evaluate friend and foe objectively.  They systematically misread the
 motives and intentions of others, projecting their own problems onto
 people in the outer world.  In aggregate all these attributes, while
 making their possessors difficult to work with, render many of them
 peculiarly susceptible to approach and development.
 Finally, even in more normal people, we should look especially at
 the unique vulnerabilities of middle age.  The incidence of various
 types of emotional and mental breakdown is highest in the middle-
 age category.  The period of life from say age 37 on shows the highest
 incidences of divorce, disappearance, alcoholism, infidelity, suicide,
 embezzlement-and probably defection, overt or in place.
 The reasons for this phenomenon are not hard to find.  There is
 the onset of decline from physiological peak; one's children suddenly
 are no longer children but young adults, bringing a sharp realization
 of the passage of one's life; youthful ambitions and ideals suffer dis-
 illusion and then sudden, brutal collapse; career turning-points occur
 at this time.  The prospect of an insignificant old age looms large
 and immediate.  Most men, according to numerous qualified sources,
 go through a complete reevaluation of personal philosophy, religious
 and moral beliefs, and so on in this period.'  It is the time when a
 man takes stock of his life, and the result is frequently traumatic in
 the extreme.   This so-called "middle-age revolt" is of exceptional
 importance from an intelligence operations standpoint, since men of
 37 or older are usually well advanced in their professional careers
 and highly enough placed to make them extremely interesting targets.
 Symptoms and Sources
 What precisely, then, should we look for in our scrutiny of source
 materials during the initial search for targets?  The following sketches
 the outline of an indicator list; it is not, of course, complete or
 comprehensive:

 All of the above are relative questions; they call for qualitative
 evaluation of the ways a given Soviet relates to other Soviets.    To
 make valid evaluations of this type requires persons, analysts and case
 officers, who know and understand the Soviets as participants in their
 own culture and society.  It requires mature, sophisticated, socially
 sensitive, and observant persons who mingle and converse with a
 broad range of Soviets reasonably frequently and over a period of time.
 Telephone taps and audio sources which provide coverage of in-
 ternal conversations in a Soviet colony, properly read, are an exceed-
 ingly valuable source of clues and leads bearing on the questions of
 interest.  Wives' personal chatter and complaints, the planning of
 social events (picnics, hunting and fist    rov'ednior'ele)ase12005/01/05: CI
 said when the children become ill, when the boss insists a man leave
 his lunch to come to the office, when people arc planning home leave-
 all of these situations are among the kind that provide occasion for
 personal commentary, for flashes of irritation, frustration, and anger,
 for identifying persons who are disliked or isolated, and so on
 People who have business relations with the Soviets visit their offices
 frequently and also attend parties and receptions.  As recruited agents,
 they can report on pecking order, on arrogance/ submissiveness, on
 the personal manner and personality of individual Soviets, and on
 warmth or coldness in interpersonal relationships, as well as more con-
 crete observations such as disparaging remarks made by one Soviet
 about another, jokes and ridicule, flashes of irritation and anger, im-
 patience in dealing with people, and so on.  As a given Soviet be-
 comes acquainted with such a contact and gains confidence in him,
 he may over time decide that the man is no risk, regardless of what
 the security officer might say, and may increasingly confide in him.
 All of these observations and confidences provide insight into the Soviet
 colony and produce the hints and leads we are seeking.
 Double agent operations can also, in certain circumstances, produce
 similar information.
 Finally, there is direct diplomatic or social contact.  Numerous ad-
 vantages accrue from a broad and continuing contact of this kind.
 Foremost is the short-circuiting of all the indirect assessment problems,
 problems occasioned by working through one or several intermediaries;
 face-to-face meetings by trained intelligence professionals should pro-
 duce far more comprehensive and reliable impressions.                                                                                                                     Second, the
 direct American-Soviet confrontation permits individuals on each side
 to become acquainted with individuals on the other and so dispels
 the numerous halo effects and stereotype conceptions that arise when
 the two are isolated from each other.  Third, if there is information
 already on hand leading to a given target or if it is obtained from
 another source such as a telephone tap, it is far easier, faster, and
 more productive to undertake direct probing and development of him
 and observe and evaluate at first hand his reactions.  Fourth, it is ex-
 tremely useful, if not indeed essential, to expose a given target to a
 range of diverse personality types, for purposes of both assessment
 and development.  Finally, an intelligence officer (and to a lesser
 degree any U.S. government officer) can be much more fully briefed
 and guided than say a third-national agent.

 Program Training
 A, third prerequisite for making an operational program of our prin-
 ciple, we said, was to provide an enabling point of view for case of-
 ficers and analysts and sensitize them to the indicators.             One aspect
 of the problem is that most case officers regard Soviet recruitments as
 a will-of-the-wisp and simply refuse, in practice if not in words, to give
 the required effort to the task. The other is that they do not recognize
 the necessity for sensitive observation, through fairly subtle indicators,
 of personality relationships and adjustments.  If a case officer cannot
 himself do these things, it is of course unrealistic to expect him to give
 adequate guidance to his agents.  The net result is that a supervisor
 trying to run such a program must spend an inordinate amount of
 time in personal debriefings and guidance of these people.  Some
 examples follow.
 Three different officers in a field station were successively charged
 with responsibility for screening telephone tap production.  They were
 given the criteria for selection, and examples taken from live material
 were repeatedly drawn to their attention.  Yet time after time they
 all failed to notice interesting and possibly important leads in the
 material.  One item missed: a series of telephone calls indicating that
 a given Soviet was having serious marital problems, was drinking
 heavily (on one occasion throwing the embassy into a flap at 2 a.m.),
 and. was having difficulty in his work as a result.  (A year later new
 evidence showed the marital problems to be deep and durable ones.
 Ile was of minority ethnic origin, and his wife, a Great Russian, ridi-
 culed him as representative of this minority nationality.)  Second item
 missed: A senior officer newly assigned to the Soviet embassy con-
 ducted himself with great arrogance, constantly using offensive and
 abusive language over the telephone and creating numerous enemies.
 (It has more recently been found that this same officer may be having
 not one but several affairs simultaneously within the Soviet colony.)
 Third item missed: Two Soviet officers were reflected in telephone
 conversation as absolutely despising each other, to such an extent that
 they could not even be seated next to each other at an official function.
 Fourth item missed: In an operational development that was heading
 toward a defection approach, a key unknown was the relationship of
 the target with his wife.  Overt observation had suggested that it was
 the hoped-for cold and perfunctory one; a warm feeling between them
 would probably vitiate the whole approach.  The missed conversa-
 tion, on a newly acquired tap, established beyond a shadow of doubt
 that husband and wife were warm and iloptjved For Release 2005/01/05 :
 Reports on social contacts can be equally frustrating from a super-
 visory standpoint.  In reporting physical characteristics, intelligence
 officers trained in anti-Soviet operations generally produce good de-
 scriptions of Soviets they meet.  But when it goes beyond the physical
 to observations on interpersonal relationships and psychological nu-
 ances, they rarely produce acceptable reports in the sense of what is
 needed for a program of this kind.  One officer who had flirted with
 a Soviet's wife recalled gleefully some weeks after the event how the
 husband had bristled with antagonism from across the room, obviously
 watching every move she made.  This incident had not been noted
 either in the written report of contact or in the oral debriefing after
 the party.
 Another intelligence officer, speaking fluent Russian, gained accept-
 ance from the Soviets and frequently attended their get-togethers and
 embassy receptions.  But this officer treats social/ diplomatic contact
 as just that: his eyes are blind to behavioral nuances and his cars are
 closed to anything except art, books, theatre, and so on.  Nothing
 can be elicited from him concerning which Soviet talks to which and
 in what manner, or which habitually wanders around alone and un-
 engaged with others.                                                                                                                   Superior in many aspects of his job performance,
 he seems to have a blind spot when it comes to functioning as a
 spotter or developer. He will note that a Soviet has a seventeen-year-
 old boy; but that this same Soviet is very upset because the boy's
 education is about to be broken off by conscription escapes him.
 Another officer, reporting that a Soviet had been in London, failed
 to report that the London visit was a six-month familiarization assign-
 ment in the embassy, which usually means a KGB probationary tour.
 Met later by another officer, this Soviet turned out to be a quiet,
 thoughtful, and seemingly impressionable young man; there was no
 such description in the original contact reports.  With glowing sincer-
 ity he now characterized his experience in London as "the most
 wonderful six months" in his life.  The original case officer, ap-
 prised of this remark, said "Oh I know that, he told me that a long
 time ago!"
 These sad stories could go on, but the point is made: officers must
 be trained and sensitized, and first of all they must be convinced that
 Soviets can be recruited and it is worth the effort.  This is a long-

 Access and Development
 If we can overcome this obstacle, the final requirement for making
 the program operational is gaining access to the Soviets in question
 and knowing what to do when it is gained-things easier said than
 done.  Access is in a sense the key question of Soviet operations.
 if normal social, business, and diplomatic intercourse with the Soviets
 were possible, most of the problems to which this paper is addressed
 would not exist.  Many of the operational approaches and gimmicks
 which have been devised over the years have been efforts to evade
 or surmount restrictions on getting next to the target.
 Some of these restrictions are created by Soviet security practices and
 controls of one type or another.  In addition to specific control pro-
 cedures, the intense security indoctrination the Soviets get implants in
 them suspicion and anxiety about any foreign contact.  So even when
 you succeed in establishing an outside relationship with one or two
 Soviets, you usually find that it is leading nowhere unless you get
 invited to their home ground, where, paradoxically, you have a chance
 to break out of the controlled channel by assessing individual Soviets
 in their own environment and observing their relationships with each
 other.  Outside the Bloc practically the only place where this is pos-
 sible is at Satellite or Soviet receptions, or to a lesser degree at some
 third-national receptions.  Invitations to these are therefore the first
 objective, regardless of whether you are seeking an opportunity in
 person or trying to maneuver embassy officers, indigenous business-
 men or other contacts, or recruited agents of any nationality into
 promising situations.
 Of equal importance with the Soviet restrictions are our own self-
 limitations.  These result from general American attitudes towards
 the cold-war enemy, the reflection of this in the official climate estab-
 lished by an embassy, a reluctance on the part of American diplo-
 matic and even intelligence officers to consort with Soviets and East
 Europeans, and a general diplomatic ineptitude in dealing with them,
 often marked by the apparently irresistible urge to be one up on them,
 embarrass them, and score at their expense in order to look good as a
 loyal and clever American diplomat when the Political Counsellor
 reads the Memorandum of Conversation.  More on this subject a little
 later.                            Approved For Release 2005/01/05  Cl

 Third-National and Indigenous Agents
 In the face of this reluctance of the official American communit1
 abroad to indulge in social contact with Soviets, a natural course is
 to emphasize the alternative and complementary program of running
 agents into the Soviet-Satellite community.  These may be Americar
 (including staff agents under deep cover), indigenous, or third.
 nationals.  They may be persons already in business or other contact
 with the Soviets whom we can coopt, or they may be carefully selected
 "pigeons" whom we recruit, train, and then set up in positions where
 we hope the Soviets may be interested enough to cultivate them.
 'The agent approach is indeed an essential part of any comprehen-
 sive program.  Third-national agents, in particular, provide a broader
 base for assessments and development, offer windows that may have
 a truer view of certain targets than an American can get, and fre-
 quently give access to Soviet groups that, like trade :missions, are
 beyond reach through normal diplomatic channels.  It does suffer,
 however, from certain inherent difficulties.  One is that the unilateral
 cooption of people with established Soviet contacts is replete with
 security hazards, including a high probability of their being doubled
 by the local security service as well as by the Soviets, and the con-
 sequent limitations on the extent to which they can be safely briefed
 and guided.  Finding them in the first place may require an extensive
 investigative effort, and then come operational maneuvers to screen,
 contact, and develop them.  A year or more may thus be required
 to procure only a handful of such agents.  And as noted, if we are
 doing this unilaterally we are operating in the same area and against
 the same targets as the local services.
 The planting of agents especially recruited and trained for this
 purpose is an important program that takes even more time.  Finding
 suitable persons, recruiting and training them, creating situations
 leading to contacts, and developing plausible relation ships are a
 matter of long-term effort that should be undertaken in sufficient
 mass to make up for the likelihood of failures.  After the laborious
 preparation the plant may fail to evoke any interest whatever from
 the targets.  Or he may develop a relationship which the local
 security service then calls him in to explain.  If he escapes these
 hazards the time will still come in most agent-mediated operations,

 Approved ForRRelease 2005/01/05 : Cl
 ecrui men
 must be introduced to make a face-to-face assessment and possibly
 take over the development.'
 The citation of these difficulties in trying to maneuver agents
 against Soviet targets, along with a conclusion that the percentage
 over time of yield from such operations will be low, is not intended
 to convey a pessimistic or defeatist attitude regarding this use of
 agents.  It is intended as grounds for insisting that such operations
 must be part of a comprehensive, long-term, focussed program; and
 this is not a program that can be run with the left hand, so to speak,
 part-time, by officers assigned also to other duties whose product
 may be more immediately tangible and gratifying to a chief of station.
 Diplomatic Contact
 Broad and regular diplomatic contact with the Soviet colony is
 the other main approach to the access problem.  Against its unde-
 niable limitations and dangers, it offers the advantages of direct assess-
 ment, personal acquaintance and familiarity, gradual development
 through conversations, rapid contact in any sudden opportunity for
 more direct approach, and a high degree of control over what is said
 to the target and how it is said.
 The opportunity for this kind of contact is probably much greater
 than the accepted mythology allows.  The Soviets are said to shy
 away from such contacts, to be prohibited from accepting invitations,
 to mouth nothing but the Party line, to walk away if an American
 approaches, and so on.  Undoubtedly this is a true picture in many
 places.  In this writer's experience in one country, however, such
 beliefs, buttressed by a few casual experiences, had effectively inhib-
 ited efforts to cultivate Soviet bloc representatives for a considerable
 period of time, but when a determined and prolonged effort was
 finally made it paid off handsomely, to everyone's surprise.  The
 principal obstacles, it transpired, had been skepticism, indifference,
 and hostility within the American establishment.
 A truer picture would show that Soviet intelligence officers and
 coopted workers are under instructions to cultivate Americans-for
 ' This statement is based in part upon the proposition, not here to be developed,
 that no Soviet is going to consider seriously defection to nationals or intelligence
 services of small powers.  When a Soviet begins to think about treason, he is
 going to think of either Britain (along with some Commonwealth countries) or
 the United States.  Third-national agent assessments are in any case, in this
 writer's opinion, not to be considered reliable; that is why a first-hand profes-
 sional assessment must be obtained.         Approved For Release 2005/01/05

 ecruitment
 identification, assessment, and transmission of "disinformation"--and
 moreover that, as human beings in a dull and restrictive environment,
 they welcome such contacts, whatever their official aims may be. This
 truer picture would distinguish between intelligence officers and other
 Soviets; the latter are truly wary of friendly contacts with Westerners
 while under the eyes of their security shepherds and tend to avoid
 Westerners at receptions.  Finally, willingness to engage in broad
 diplomatic contact, in all probability, varies considerably from one
 Soviet embassy to another, depending on the local situation, the per-
 sonalities of the ambassador and the intelligence rezidents and so on.
 But we don't find out what we can do in any particular place until
 we really try.
 There are a variety of reasons why Foreign Service, USES, and
 military attache personnel and even intelligence officers under official
 cover are so often reluctant to involve themselves with Soviet bloc
 representatives.  Some don't want it on their records that they have
 had Eastern associations; some imagine that the Soviets are ten feet
 tall; many feel that it's too much work with too little to show for it;
 some have a visceral distaste for intelligence and just don't want to
 get involved in it.  Many officers are therefore also indifferent to
 standing instructions that contacts and relationships be reported,
 dilatory in writing reports, and reluctant to be debriefed.  And there
 is a certain category of persons whose chief delight is to bait, embar-
 rass, and insult their Eastern counterparts.
 For this latter there is no excuse.  Yet time after time one can see
 officers-military, diplomatic, and intelligence-ruining contacts: "All
 that guy could do was talk about himself, I just walked away."
 "This jerk fastened himself to me like a leech, so I told him off." "He
 was so stupid I couldn't make any money with him."  "When he got
 gushy about friendship I asked him why they didn't take the same
 approach to disarmament negotiation."  "That fat slob is too incom-
 petent as an Army officer for me to waste my time talking to him."
 It must be recognized that some of the American inhibitions are
 not wholly without justification.  The KGB is known to put at the
 top of its priorities the cultivation of American officials in order to
 assess them, determine who does what in their installations, attempt
 compromises, and hopefully recruit.  But this fact merely calls for
 discrimination on our part in selecting those-intelligence officers or
 others--whom we encourage to cultivate and be cultivated by the

 Many of the difficulties are often traceable to a single underlying
 cause, an indifference pervading the individual establishment. The
 tone or attitude of an official representation is determined by the
 ambassador and his deputy.  If the ambassador is indifferent, skep-
 tical, or hostile toward this intelligence objective, then it is an uphill
 .struggle all the time.  On a personal basis one can secure the full
 cooperation of Foreign Service, USIS, and attache officers, but usu-
 ally only at the cost of time and developmental efforts which should
 be invested rather in operations against targets.  The only solution
 visible to this writer is a continuing flow of requirements and guid-
 ances not only from intelligence headquarters but also from the State
 Department emphasizing the Soviet operations problem.  Until the
 U.S. Government addresses itself integrally to this problem, the intel-
 ligence effort will tend to peter out in paper exercises.
 The Soviets are a highly disciplined group, intensively indoctri-
 nated, provocation-minded, keenly suspicious, insulated, and operat-
 ing within security controls and secret observation several orders of
 magnitude greater than anything to which we are accustomed.  They
 are prideful and highly sensitive to slight.  At the same time, as indi-
 viduals, many of them are extremely anxious for adventure and
 exposure beyond these narrow confines, and many are eager for
 acceptance and approval by Westerners and by Americans.      This
 mixture of conflicting tendencies can produce interesting results
 and points to operationally useful tactics.
 While Soviet relationships with the British and Americans (and
 some others) are under tight official control, those with other nation-
 alities may be, for diplomatic or other reasons, much more relaxed.
 Thus it may be unusual (as well as operationally undesirable) for a
 Soviet to accept a singleton invitation from an American but not at
 all unusual to see singleton Soviets at parties given, for example, by
 the Indians, the Iraqis, or the French.  And at such a third-national
 party the singleton Soviet can be approached, conversation can flow
 easily, and after a number of such meetings over a period of time
 a real relationship and bond may develop.  The Soviet is in a posi-
 tion--limited, of course, by the possible presence of Soviet agents
 at the party-to report the contact or not, or to slant the report, as
 he sees fit.  But the minute an attempt is made to convert this relation-
 ship to an overt Soviet-American one, it comes into the purview of
 Approved For Release 2005/01/05 :
 SECRET
 -RDP78T03194'666V6d30001-0
 the rezident and the security officer, and it will be either abruptly
 terminated or run as a controlled intelligence contact.
 In twos or more, on the other hand, the Soviets will often accept
 invitations from Britishers and Americans, even during periods of
 international tension, especially to reasonably large parties or recep-
 tions which have a diplomatic or official rather than personal and
 pointed tone.  It is perfectly possible, over a period of time and in
 a succession of large cocktail party meetings, to conduct highly useful
 conve sations with a chosen target, even though other Soviets are
 charging around and perhaps watching closely from across the room.
 This is a device that can be used at posts where there is no mecha-
 nism to assist elements of the diplomatic community, especially new-
 comers, to meet their counterparts from other countries.  Where there
 are organs like International Clubs or Diplomats' Associations they
 enormously simplify the problem of meeting Soviets and spotting links.
 Most officers in a Soviet establishment speak the local language,
 usually quite well, and very few Americans speak Russian.  It is
 often argued, therefore, that the Soviets will immediately suspect a
 Russian-speaking American of being an intelligence officer and shy
 away from him, so that in order to allay suspicion it is better for
 American officers to speak the local language.  This argument is
 fallacious on three counts.
 First, in order not to start out from a position of inferiority, the
 American should he able to speak the indigenous language as well
 as the Soviets do.  In many places he usually is not.  A man with
 a six-month or one-year quickie course in one of the less common
 languages usually cannot compare with the product of the Soviet
 institutes, who may, moreover, be serving his second or third tour in
 the area.  Second, the argument presumes that the Soviets will have
 nothing to do with a suspected intelligence officer.  This is simply not
 true, any more than that we will have nothing to do with a suspected
 Soviet intelligence officer.  Finally, there is the fact that many .Hes-
 sians ate genuinely pleased to have a foreigner speak to them in their
 own tongue. At a recent Soviet reception this writer had the pleasant
 experience of finding himself "receiving" his Soviet hosts: at one time
 there were seven Russians lined up to introduce themselves to their
 Russian-speaking guest, one third secretary even elbowing his way
 past the GRU deputy chief.

 What to Say
 Here are some observations, which apply both to direct contact
 and to the guidance of agents, on how to talk to Russians.  The first
 and overriding rule: Warmth, openness, sincerity, interest. A cold,
 suspicious, cautious, unresponsive person is greeted with coldness,
 suspicion, caution, and indifference.  Second rule: Avoid polemics,
 political evangelism, criticism, one-upmanship.  Third rule: Don't
 probe.  Fourth rule: Show respect where respect is due.8
 Remember that the object of the exercise is not to pass the after-
 noon, conduct political arguments, or cement international relations;
 it is to recruit Soviets.  The immediate purposes of the social contact
 are to build rapport, to elicit responses useful for assessment, to assist
 chosen targets in articulating grievances, to awaken resentments and
 anxieties, to plant ideas, to make oneself a sympathetic friend, a
 channel, a "connection."  These objectives should be best served
 by questioning and conversation on topics which we know from our
 many studies to be likely to stimulate anti-regime responses, tailored
 to the extent possible to the individual Soviet in question so as to
 strike a responsive note without giving cause for alarm.

 backed away, but not without absorbing our point.  The rapport was
 not broken, and we have a reasonable belief that the conversations
 were never reported.  No defection, no recruitment; but who knows,
 in the future, if perhaps the system should kick him hard in the teeth.
 Example No. 2.    GRU colonel, civilian journalist cover.  Spotted
 and developed by third-national agents.  Difficult personality, dis-
 liked by a number of other Soviets.  Cultural pretensions.                                                                                                                     Pompous
 and conceited, high self-estimate, but work actually marginal.  Self-
 indulgent.  Strongly dependent personality, would refuse to rebut
 political arguments.  Drinking progressively more during his tour,
 toward the end approaching near-alcoholism.  Under pressure would
 block up and become unable to express himself.  Marital situation
 unknown, although ample evidence of frequent friction with his wife.
 Constantly chafing against the "bureaucracy." Frequently in trouble
 with the embassy.
 After development by agents, warmly accepted direct American
 contact, which confirmed almost all aspects of previous indirect assess-
 ment.  He was crude, arrogant, condescending, constantly talking
 (about himself), highly insecure, seeming greatly in need of a sym-
 pathetic listener (other Soviets apparently wouldn't give him the time
 of day).  Unfortunately, just when the relationship was getting warm
 he and the Soviet ambassador discovered a common passion for chess,
 which transported him from a condition of chronic discontent, isola-
 tion, and unhappiness to a seventh heaven where all immediate oppor-
 tunity for manipulation was dissolved.9
 Our conversations with this Soviet were directed towards conveying
 a sense of the cultural ferment, freedom, experimentation, and oppor-
 tunity to be found in the West and particularly in the United States.
 We especially dwelt on the immense prestige, power, and influence
 exercised by Western journalists and commentators.  We also fed
 back to him his own complaints about the cultural and, intellectual
 " Our belief in the value of using the Russian language was strengthened by this
 case.  Both this man and his wife spoke good English, and lie also ;poke the
 local language.  As he drank, however, he would revert more and more to Rus-
 sian.                                                                                                                   His wife also, on one occasion at a party, after several hours of effort at
 being pleasant, sought us out with the plea, "Come sit and talk with me in P essian,
 I'm tired of speaking English."

 sterility of "bureaucracy," with a progressive effort to tic the terms of
 reference for this into his headquarters in Moscow and the local
 Soviet embassy.
 Example No. 3.  A young Soviet officer was noted in the telephone
 taps, soon after arriving, to be having serious difficulties with his
 wife and to be drinking very heavily.  After raising cain on the town
 one night he was apparently severely reprimanded and assigned (as
 he still is) to minor embassy drudgery.  His parents were divorced,
 we ]earned, and as a child he lived with his stepmother and mother
 alternately, a pointer to one possible source of his problems.  A third-
 national agent with a logical business cover established contact with
 him, and a warm though unproductive relationship has resulted.  (It
 is unproductive because the intermediary agent is an unimaginative
 plod, unresponsive to requirements and guidance by virtue of inability
 to grasp any subtleties whatever.  But we keep trying.)
 The Soviet did make one interesting point in a conversation with
 the agent, to wit: "Please don't invite me out.  We are not like the
 Ccrrnans or British or Americans and cannot accept an invitation just
 like that.  If I accept your invitation, I must obtain approval, and
 for this I must offer explanation, provide justifications, and so on.
 You like ine and I like you, but it just isn't worth it."
 Our efforts to get additional means of regular access to this man
 have so far been fruitless.  Recently, however, upon being introduced
 to this writer, he was talking within minutes about the sterility and
 boredom of existence in the confines of the Soviet colony.  11e is out-
 going, bored, curious, anxious to see and learn, chafing under embassy
 restrictions, and at least partially perceptive of the negative aspects
 of the Soviet system.  He deserves further exploration, to assist him
 in the articulation of his discontents and to discover whether his
 personality, political, and career problems are deep and strong enough
 to provide fuel for a channeled explosion.
 These examples illuminate to some extent the generalization that
 the safest, most innocuous way to surface and. cultivate anti-social
 tendencies and personal grievances, as well as plant ideas and com-
 municate sympathy, is by questions on certain crucial topics: "What
 is your promotion system?"  "You look very tired tonight, have you
 been working too hard?" "You say you are bored and hate this place,
 but there is this and this and this to do, you have a very pleasant
 and beautiful Club, how can you feel that way?"  "Why do you call

 assign a man like B [whom we know the respondent hates] to such a
 responsible post?"
 Digression: Virtues of the Interrogative
 The utility of questions in stimulating conversation, in focussing
 thought, in causing inner turmoil (if that is what you want to do),
 and in communicating a sympathetic awareness is of more than mere
 tactical value.  The mind functions four to five times as fast as oral
 communication, so that even under the best circumstances, when a
 respondent is interested in what you. are saying, his attention and
 thoughts are continually straying, elaborating.  Under less than the
 best circumstances, where there is a language problem and the re-
 spondent is only mildly or even negatively interested, his attention is
 constantly wandering and the effectiveness of your communication
 can go well below 10 percent.  Addressing him a question, however,
 serves to engage almost his whole consciousness, prevents his thoughts
 from wandering, appeals to his ego, and communicates an interest in
 him and his opinions.
 In addition, the responses to certain types of questions can be use-
 ful in assessment; the so-called projective questions, requiring expres-
 sions of preference, interest, and the like, arc an essential part of
 assessment.  For example: "Who is your favorite author [or fictional
 hero]?" "What do you hope to do when you retire?" "What is it you
 like best [or least] about living in such and such a country?" "What
 do you want your children to do in life?" "Why did you choose the
 foreign service?"  "Your work involves talking to people a lot, do
 you like that?"  "Why did you [a Satellite representative] like the
 movie `Chance Meeting'?"
 Suitable questions are the most effective way to probe personally
 and politically sensitive topics and implant ideas without running a
 risk of alienating the respondent or exposing your own prior knowl-
 edge.                                                                                                          A sure way to alienate Soviets is to criticize the system, its
 methods and policies, etc., even if you know what you are talking
 about and even though the Soviet may agree with you.  The 'better
 way to get him to think such thoughts is to trigger then by seemingly
 innocuous questions.  "What do you do with your evenings?"  "Have
 you been dancing at A?"  "Have you visited B?"  "Do you prefer
 to spend your time at your own Club here?"  These questions (and
 many more like them), directed at a person already chafing at the
 restricted and highly organized Soviet embassy existence (a fact

 known to you from other sources), will certainly provoke inner reac-
 tions, no matter what the overt response is.70
 The Last Step
 After all these many words we are still faced with the crucial
 problem of how this whole process is to be carried to the point of
 defection or recruitment, as the case may be.  In a sense, to be sure,
 we can consider all we have done-identifying targets, establishing
 relationships with them, working on their frustrations, pressures,
 prides, and ambitions-as worth-while programmed work to increase
 the probability of walk-ins. And that it will often be. Only in a most
 unusual and favorable case will an outright approach be made, and
 then only after every aspect has been studied and restudied at head-
 quarters and in the field and the plan specifically tailored to its oppor-
 tunities, peculiarities, and risks.
 But to complete a hypothetical case let us assume that we have
 arrived at the stage of considering an outright approach.  We are
 working with a Soviet who is definitely "different"-an odd-ball of
 some type, neurotic, "alienated," possibly quite disturbed. We know
 a great deal about him from a number of different sources as well as
 through direct contact.  He has shown a tendency to relax and talk
 about his personal problems with his American or other friend.  He
 has shown he has the nerve to side-step Soviet security controls, and
 we have strong grounds for believing that he is not reporting his
 conversations with us.   We believe that we have detected an impor-
 tant change in his relationship with other Soviets (which may not
 have passed unnoticed by them either).
 "This digression on the interrogative was derived from the theory of sales work,
 a fact which provokes a further digression: It is strange that a profession so highly
 dependent on personal contact, personal rapport, and personal influence as clandes-
 tine operations is has paid practically no attention to such allied lines of endeavor
 as social case work and selling.  The sales profession has intensively applied both
 pragmatic insight and psychological research to problems of personal effectiveness,
 rapport, interpersonal influence, the hard sell, and the soft, insidious sell.  It has
 no qualms whatever about telling a salesman both how he is to talk to people
 and what he is to say, with highly effective results.  A manual entitled Cold Call
 Selling, published by the National Sales Development Institute, is the finest piece
 this writer has seen on the "cold approach."  (It cost him $17.00, which couldn't
 be written off operationally but was at least income tax deductible.)  Elmer Leter-
 man's Creative Selling is a fine manual on personal contact, especially on the soft
 sell.
 What do we do now?  Here we should keep in mind the very
 basic proposition that a man who defects is running away from some-
 thing too big for him to cope with, and a man who changes sides in
 place is fighting back against something.  Neither is being pulled to
 us by personal magnetism or ideological attraction, even though these
 motives may appear as rationalizations.  Our role then is to continue
 to build up, in our contacts with him and perhaps by clandestine
 irritant actions on the side, these inner pressures that are driving him.
 At this stage we try to contribute to building in him the conviction
 that there is no hope for him within the Soviet system.  Now we can
 do what we could not earlier, try to channel and focus his resentment
 onto the top Soviet leaders, the apparatchiki who surround theist, or
 the system itself.  The process is one of pinning the blame for his
 intense personal dissatisfactions on the regime, of directing his anti-
 social tendencies, if you will, against it.
 This is a stage of utmost interest and delicacy.  We are not trying
 to tell a Soviet things which he himself knows better and feels more
 deeply than we.     But we can build on, feed back to him, and focus
 feelings which he has already expressed.  We all know how to calm
 a friend down when he is upset; we also know, with a close friend.,
 subjects to avoid talking about, not because he would get angry at
 us but because they would hit sensitive nerves and plunge him into
 depression or trigger anxieties.  It is the reverse of this latter course,
 in moderate and appropriate doses, that we deliberately pursue with
 our Soviet "friend."
 Once a Soviet is so far along as to question his own system and
 his relationship to it, we are not far from our ultimate goal.  Once he
 begins to think of his rulers as bad or irresponsible or dangerous or
 corrupt, or as surrounded, misinformed, and manipulated by others
 who are like that, he is very close to the crossing.
 It has been our thesis here that we do have a sufficient basis of
 understanding to bring about recruitments and defections of Soviets.
 Our information sources, if they are properly used, are adequate to
 permit us at least an initial target selection; and if we deliberately
 seek out "alienated" Soviets, the neurotic or sociopathic fringe, the
 chronically unhappy, the misfits, we can significantly increase our
 probability of yield.  We must, however, seek some means of solving

 COMMUNICATION TO THE EDITORS
 Wanted: a Word
 Dear Sirs:
 The contribution from intelligence officers who defect from the
 Communist services has been one of the mainstays of our counter-
 intelligence effort, and we have accordingly sought in various ways
 to create as inviting an atmosphere as possible for further defections.
 One of the most difficult aspects of this effort, and one of the biggest
 stumbling blocks to defection, is the implication of cowardice, treason,
 and desertion not only in the act itself but also in the terminology
 applied to it.  Deserter, turncoat, renegade, apos`fate, etc., are words
 of opprobrium, and even the usual term defector, though less indignant
 than the others, carries a connotation of dishonorable motives, a
 touch of the subconscious revulsion Organization Man feels for any
 deed that undermines his organization.
 This deed is not necessarily dishonorable, however; it is usually the
 only effective action within the capabilities of an intelligence officer
 caught in the meshes of tyranny if disillusionment or his principle:;
 drive him to oppose that tyranny.  Defection from a Communist
 service requires courage as well as adroitness.  And even if a defector's motives are unworthy we don't attract him by the use of
 stigmatizing names.
 It has long been recognized that the terminology we use is infelici..
 tous from the point of view of encouraging defections, and there have
 been sporadic efforts now and then to develop a new semantic ap..
 proach.  These have not been successful; a new word or phrase is
 still being sought and is badly needed.  What we are looking for is
 a readily understandable expression conveying the idea of a courageous
 act to liberate not only oneself but other victims, one that is trans-
 latable or transliterable into foreign languages and not susceptible to
 invidious or comical perversion.  If any of your readers has a sug-
 gestion we should be happy to hear it through your good offices.

 Soviet doctrine on the holding of
 meetings with agents.
 OPERATIONAL CONTACTS'
 L. K. Bekrenev
 Personal contacts with agents are conditioned by a series of mutually
 related factors among which the following are basic:
 The situation, maturity, and importance of the agent.
 What is to be accomplished by the meeting.
 The professional skill and the legal status of case officer and agent.
 The timing, duration, and place of the meeting.
 Prevailing operational conditions.
 Quality of the Agent
 If an agent is sufficiently trusted and if he supplies valuable in-
 formation, personal contact with him should be reduced to a minimum.
 For the intervals it suffices to work out a plan for either to summon
 the other to a meeting in case of emergency.
 Even in meetings with a tested and reliable agent much attention
 is paid to security as well as to the fulfillment of intelligence require-
 ments; but in working with an agent who has not been fully assessed
 and vetted, the prime emphasis is put on vigilance and checking-has
 he been planted by the local counterintelligence, are his motives in
 agreeing to collaborate sincere?  The need for personal meetings
 with such an agent is increased, for they give the opportunity to assess
 him more completely.  But the meetings must be conducted with
 caution.  In 1959 an officer assigned to a certain residency 2 submitted
 a plan for a third-country meeting with an agent who had been re-
 cently and hurriedly recruited and not thoroughly assessed.  Head-
 quarters warned the resident 3 of the need for precautionary measures,
 and in this it proved to be correct: the agent brought along counter-
 intelligence officers to the meeting site.  The resident's application
 of precautionary measures and the case officer's observance of correct

 operating techniques en route to the meeting made possible the de-
 flection of a serious provocation by adversary counterintelligence.
 One should not neglect personal meetings with agents who are not
 sources of important information.  Agents performing support roles
 are also essential to the service and should be appreciated. If a Soviet
 intelligence officer on an illegal assignment is supplied cover by an
 auxiliary agent, his fate depends upon that agent.
 In general, whatever an agent's role in the intelligence net, personal
 contact should be made with him only when it is impossible to manage
 without it.  The number of meetings should be kept as low as possible,
 especially with sources of valuable information.  This principle holds
 for all residencies and agent groups 4 but particularly for residencies
 under legal 5 cover in countries which have severe counterintelligence
 practices.
 Purpose of Meetings
 Personal meetings may be held to give an agent his next assignment
 and instructions for carrying it out, to train him in tradecraft or the
 use of technical or communications equipment, to transmit documents,
 reports, technical equipment, money, or other items, or to fulfill several
 of these purposes.  In actual practice several purposes are usually
 served by a meeting.  In addition to its particular objectives more
 general needs can be filled.  A meeting held for training purposes may
 be a means for clarifying biographic data on the agent or his views
 on various subjects. At every meeting with an agent one should study
 him and obtain new data on his potential and talents, thereby pro-
 viding a better basis for judging his sincerity and deciding how much
 trust to place in him.
 These various objectives require different kinds of meeting in terms
 of frequency, duration, and choice of time and place.
 Professional Skill
 Success in face-to-face handling depends to a large degree on the
 professional authority of the handler, his knowledge of the business,
 the firmness of his will, his adherence to principle, and his ability to
 get along with people.  Above all else is dedication to the assignment
 and a positive resolve to achieve success and fulfill the assigned tasks.

 Vigilance in protecting one's activity and intentions not only from
 counterintelligence but also from the agent requires a developed in-
 tuition, the power of observation, and an ability to retain the initia-
 tive and assert one's will tactfully.
 Some case officers lose the initiative during agent meetings by wast-
 ing time discussing secondary matters or problems in no way related
 to the purpose of the meeting and end up failing to attain the objec-
 tives for which the meeting had been set up.  Recently, for example,
 a case officer from one of our residencies under legal cover was asked
 to make a quick contact with an agent in order to transmit to him
 Headquarters' decision that he should immediately leave the country
 because of impending danger.  Instead of executing these instructions
 immediately, the case officer devoted a meeting to completely un-
 necessary conversation about the agent's status in the country, means
 of communication, legal documentation, etc.  Then he ordered the
 agent not to travel anywhere without his approval and set another
 meeting for six days later!  The resident had to correct the situation
 immediately.
 There have been cases in which agents have actually refused to
 meet with officers who exhibited incompetence in matters concerning
 which they themselves, as specialists, were working in behalf of So-
 viet intelligence.  During meetings the case officers acted timid, were
 not serious, let their minds wander, acted stiff and formal, attempted
 to order the agents about, or did not show interest in the agents'
 problems.  Or they did not give the agents satisfactory explanations
 of operational or contact problems, betraying thereby lack of prepara-
 tion and at times confusion, which engendered doubts in the agents
 as to the security of working with them.  Such conduct has often lost
 us the services of valuable agents.
 Experienced case officers are made; not born.  Experience is ac-
 quired by practical work.  New case officers, just beginning to work
 at agent operations abroad, therefore have to hold personal meetings
 with agents.  But they learn also by example, instruction, and: coach-
 ing.                                                                                                           It is necessary to imbue them with professional skills and draw
 them gradually, starting with less complicated tasks, into the work of
 handling agents.
 Legal Status
 There have been instances in which agents have refused to meet
 with case officers whose legal position in the country was incompatible
 with their own situation.  In particular, several agents have refused

 to have meetings with officers from our military attache apparatus
 because if discovered by outsiders or counterintelligence they would
 be incriminated.  The legal status of case officers and agents is of
 utmost significance for clandestinity, security of communications, and
 ability to make personal contact and must be taken into account
 in planning meetings.
 During the years 1951-1953 our service suffered some bitter failures.
 To a significant degree these were a consequence of slackened vig-
 ilance on the part of case officers in legal residencies and of their
 agents.  The case officers would report that meetings had been carried
 out under favorable conditions and there had been no external sur-
 veillance.  But testimony at trials would subsequently show that
 counterintelligence had known not only the time and place of meetings
 but also their duration and details such as who the participants were
 and what they did, how the officers were dressed, and in one case even
 the color of the wrapper on a package that had been passed.  There
 had obviously been surveillance which both case officers and agents
 had failed to detect.
 These failures occurred, not because operational conditions were
 terribly complicated or the adversary counterintelligence service was
 so skillful, but because either the case officers or the agents had for-
 gotten to be vigilant at all times, mistaken the significance of cover
 and security, or done incorrect things.  This was what enabled
 counterintelligence to arrest our agents and expel our officers from
 the country.  At present counterintelligence practices are less severe
 in several of the eastern capitalist countries than in the west, but
 that gives no reason to weaken vigilance there.  Favorable elements
 in any operational situation should be taken advantage of, but not
 by relaxing vigilance and security consciousness.
 Illegal residencies 6  and agent groups, not being subject to sur-
 veillance of the kind experienced under legal cover, can depend better
 on having secure personal meetings.  These can be held in a re-
 laxed atmosphere and in some instances without clandestinity.  In
 every country there live many "welcome" foreigners, tourism is a mass
 phenomenon, business and family ties are widely developed; thus
 large human streams cross international borders.  No country has a
 counterintelligence service with the capability to follow every for-
 eigner? not to say every local inhabitant, in its effort to identify officers
 and agents of foreign intelligence services.
 0 Under deep cover, which in Soviet practice involves false documentation.
 This does not mean that members of illegal residencies are not
 subjected to any surveillance, only that its incidence on them is greatly
 reduced.  Provided, of course, that they have not compromised them-
 selves by mistakes or rash acts and so been placed under special ob-
 servation, counterintelligence does not follow at their heels.  More-
 over, they have greater freedom in selecting cover stories, means of
 disguise, and other security measures, even in countries with the most
 severe counterintelligence practices.
 Choice of Case Officer
 The legal status factor should be taken into account in deciding
 what case officer is to be assigned to carry out any particular meeting
 with an agent.  Initially, in legal residencies, meetings with agents
 are carried out by the officers who assessed and recruited therm.  De-
 pending on the purpose of the meeting or the importance of the agent,
 they can also be held by the resident, his deputy, or a special case
 officer sent for this purpose from Headquarters.
 Case officers in legal residencies, in the course of recruiting agents,
 cultivate new contacts among local inhabitants who seers. to have
 agent: potential.  The development of such persons, on top of already
 recruited agents, brings an increasing number of personal meetings and
 concomitant danger of detection.  In order to reduce this danger and
 also improve the management of the intelligence net, headquarters
 splits off the most valuable agents of legal residencies and sets them up
 under illegal residencies or as agent groups reporting directly to
 Headquarters via illegal channels.
 In illegal residencies and agent groups meetings are held by the
 residents, their deputies, and the group leaders.  A resident can
 assign a trusted cut-out to hold a meeting that has limited objectives
 such as transmitting materials.  Despite the favorable conditions in
 illegal residencies, meetings must be planned and held in full com-
 pliance with clandestine operational doctrine.                                                                                                               Holding them without
 professional planning is not permitted.  Each member of an illegal
 residency or agent group must check constantly for clandestin:ity and
 for the security of his illegal status and make efforts to improve that
 status.
 In principle it is undesirable to make frequent changes in the
 person assigned to meet an agent.  It: is therefore important, before
 assigning an officer to make contact with any agent, to think over
 thoroughly all the considerations presented above in order to avoid

 mistakes.  From the point of view of security, it is also improper to
 set up personal contact between the radio operator of an illegal
 residency and agents in its network.  Only the resident must know
 the identity of the radio operator.
 As a parallel security measure the agents of an illegal residency
 must not know the basic biographic data (name, nationality, addresses)
 on the resident, his assistants, or the cut-outs who effect the opera-
 tional contact.  For this reason it is better to use pseudonyms, al-
 though in practice it is not always possible.  Under no circumstances
 should horizontal lines of personal contact be permitted, even if
 adherence to this doctrine necessitates excluding an agent from opera-
 tional activity for some time.  This is a vitally important rule, es-
 pecially among valuable and trusted agents.
 Headquarters is responsible for personal contact arrangements with
 illegal residents, group leaders, and singleton case officers or agents
 reporting directly to Headquarters.  It sends out its case officers for
 this purpose, either illegally with foreign documentation or officially
 with Soviet documentation and an appropriate cover story.  The meet-
 ings can be held in the target country or in a third country.             In some
 cases the agent may be summoned to Headquarters and the business
 taken care of there.  In that case it is necessary to expunge from the
 agent's passport (or the resident's or group leader's), all notations con-
 cerning his stay in the Soviet Union.
 Choice of Place
 The choice of meeting place is of considerable importance and
 should be made deliberately and with foresight.  It has to lend itself
 to the objectives of the meeting, suit the positions in society of the
 agent and case officer, and satisfy security considerations.  Meetings
 can be held on city streets, in parks, restaurants, cafes, reading rooms,
 or museums, out of town, in the suburbs, etc.  The range of possibili-
 ties depends to a large degree on the creative initiative of members of
 the residency, conditioned by a firm knowledge of the real operational
 situation, local conditions, and the structure and techniques of the
 counterintelligence and police forces.
 Elements to be taken into account include the severity of the
 country's administration, the sensitivity of the police force, the extent
 to which police and counterintelligence check local inhabitants, for-
 eigners, employees of Soviet installations, main highways, streets, and
 squares, and how well state and private buildings and transportation

 facilities are guarded.  Similarly it is necessary to hear in mind the
 degree to which counterintelligence and police agents are planted in
 enterprises and public buildings such as theaters, museums., libraries,
 and restaurants. In addition to counterintelligence activity, one should
 consider police measures for maintaining public order, particularly
 the control of criminal elements and lesser violators of law and
 morality.  In the summer of 1959, for example, two of our illegals
 meeting abroad found themselves in a district where the police were
 conducting a roundup of such elements.  When they saw what was
 going on they took off, but could not get away without having their
 documents inspected by the police.  The situation would have been
 much worse for an officer under legal cover meeting with an agent.
 For prolonged meetings it is necessary to choose places which out-
 siders cannot observe.  Frequently the agent is picked up at some
 predetermined place in an automobile and taken for operational work
 to a place chosen earlier that the agent himself had not known about.
 The agent's own car can also be used for this purpose.  It is best
 not to hold conversations on operational matters in the automobile,
 for it is possible that a recorder might be hidden in it.
 Places for long meetings present fewer difficulties in illegal resi-
 dencies.  Their members can meet in their own apartments, in hotels,
 or in out-of-town resort areas without any special risk of suspicion.
 But even in illegal residencies the demands of clandestinity and secu-
 rity must be observed in choosing meeting places.  The local opera-
 tional climate and the status of the persons to take part in the meet-
 ing must be taken into account.
 The problem is greater in residencies under legal cover.  lUlere it
 is best either to have reliable safehouses or to deliver the agent dis-
 creetly to the official residency building.  The latter is a serious opera-
 tional move.  If neither is feasible, it is better to have headquarters
 dispatch an officer to a third country, either legally or illegally, for
 the meeting.
 Here are some of the mistakes sometimes made by case officers
 of legal residencies.  They hold meetings in restaurants and other
 public establishments located near hotels and houses where employees
 of Soviet installations, sometimes even the case officers themselves,
 reside.  The service personnel in such establishments know the iden-
 tities of Soviet citizens.  Some of them may be counterintell igenc_e
 agents, and in any case they may spot our officer holding a meeting
 and report to the police or the counterintelligence service.  Other

 meetings are held near guarded compounds and government installa-
 tions where more intense surveillance is maintained than elsewhere.
 Some case officers use the same site for successive meetings over an
 extended period of time.  Others hold meetings in their own or the
 agent's apartment, sometimes taking along their wives in order to
 suggest a family friendship.  These fail to realize that social inter-
 course implies a closer relationship than legitimate business relations
 and unquestionably will not escape notice in these days of intense
 counterintelligence activity.
 Timing, Duration, Frequency
 In the matter of timing it is always necessary to bear in mind the
 current foreign policy objectives of the Soviet government so that
 these will not be prejudiced by any unfavorable incident arising from
 the operational contact.  If there is any such risk the meeting should
 be postponed until another time.  This applies to meetings with agents
 that are poorly assessed or insufficiently tested, particularly if there
 is doubt of their bona fides.  It applies also when there is a pos-
 sibility that the case officer will be under surveillance as he leaves for
 the meeting.  This consideration should be borne in mind by case
 officers of illegal residencies but especially by those in residencies un-
 der legal cover.
 Governments of capitalist countries sometimes pursue political ends
 by having counterintelligence set up special provocations against So-
 viet officials and catch them meeting with agents or agent candidates.
 The object may be to compromise Soviet foreign policy, strain inter-
 national relations, or strengthen the political position of the capitalist
 government, especially if it is currently trying to get a military or
 anti-democratic law through parliament.  Sometimes this is done
 against the opposition of the counterintelligence service, for the pre-
 mature detention of the Soviet officer may frustrate its effort to make
 a thorough study of his contacts. As a rule provocations against our
 officers are associated with an international or internal political de-
 velopment, and they are even mounted against officials who have no
 connection with agent operations.
 Meetings should be kept as short as the transaction of the business
 allows.  The case officer and agent must not be together without a
 purpose.  They should not waste time discussing matters having no
 substantial relationship to the business at hand.  This does not mean
 that one should talk to the agent only about business in dry bureau-
 Approved For Release 2005/01/05 :

 cratic language. Sensitivity towards the agent's interests must be
 developed.  If the situation permits, he should be heard out even on
 matters which were not anticipated when the meeting was planned
 but which have an operational relationship and can influence his
 future work.  But he should not be permitted to deflect the talk into
 a labyrinth of secondary, insignificant topics.  The case officer must
 keep the initiative in his own hands, and he must remember that con-
 trol of a meeting in a proper and businesslike manner cuts down its
 length.
 Frequent meetings with the same agent are unwise, especially if he
 is a tested and reliable one producing important secret information.
 Meetings with such agents can be reduced to one or two a year, or
 even fewer, held whenever possible in third countries.  Routine
 transactions can be taken care of through nonpersonal forms of com-
 munication.  With more ordinary agents it should not be necessary
 to meet oftener than once every two or three months.  These limita-
 tions are of special importance for residencies under legal cover.
 Operational Conditions
 It should be taken as axiomatic that Soviet intelligence officers under
 legal cover are subject to counterintelligence scrutiny in all capitalist
 countries, most effectively in those with severe counterintelligence prac-
 tices. In some European and eastern countries the counterintelligence
 effort is not as intense as in the countries of the Anglo-American bloc,
 and the operational situation is therefore "easier."  But this seeming
 ease never justifies reduced vigilance and security-consciousness on the
 part of case officers and agents.  Flaps still occur in countries where
 the operational situation appears to be relatively favorable, and
 analysis shows that flaps do not depend on the complexity or simplic-
 ity of the operational situation but are traceable to deficiencies in the
 camouflage of operational activity, slackening of vigilance, and neglect
 of cover and clandestinity.
 In capitalist countries of the east that have comparatively small
 counterintelligence apparatuses, the activities of our legal residencies
 still do not necessarily go without observation.  The counterintel-
 ligence programs of such countries as the U.S.A., England, and France
 are also extended to those eastern countries and seek to undermine
 and compromise the favorably developing relations between them and
 the Soviet Union.  The capitalist counterintelligence services exploit
 in this effort all the national peculiarities of which the east has many.

 This tactic of adversary counterintelligence carries possibilities of
 great unpleasantness for us.
 Because of the operational conditions now prevailing in capitalist
 countries, intelligence officers, especially those in residencies under
 legal cover, must seek out and apply the most reliable forms and
 methods of camouflage and clandestinity when meeting personally
 with agents. Although the holding of personal meetings has been
 rendered difficult for them, with proper study, good planning, and
 careful execution it can be successful.  Counterintelligence surveil-
 lance of personnel in Soviet installations abroad is not so tight or con-
 tinuous as to make operational activity impossible.  As a rule it is
 intermittent and is shifted from one case officer to another and even
 to persons that have no connection with agent operations.  A counter-
 intelligence service does not possess the means for uninterrupted sur-
 veillance in all places at all times in all cities; it uses various systems,
 and observation teams do not work around the clock in all places.
 Once one understands the working patterns of a particular counter-
 intelligence service, obstacles erected by it can be circumvented.
 An agent with whom personal contact is maintained must be in-
 culcated by his case officer with the qualities of a clandestine per-
 sonality.  He must be invested with the ability to camouflage himself,
 to exercise vigilance, to determine whether he is being observed by
 counterintelligence.  He must have the ability to spot surveillance at
 his place of work or outside his place of work, especially when de-
 parting for an operational meeting.
 Agents' carelessness or inexperience in matters of security has often
 resulted in operational flaps.  Some agents have failed to attach sig-
 nificance to the circumstance that someone, often an acquaintance or
 friend, began to show intensified interest in them before the com-
 promise.  They ignored changes in their relationships with co-workers
 and friends. They did not wonder about the appearance of new faces
 in their milieu.  Some agents, because of inexperience or in a delib-
 erate violation of security rules induced by personal rashness, have
 failed to check for surveillance when going to an operational meeting.
 Some agents go to operational meetings unprepared, without thinking
 out their future actions in advance, and have not planned what be-
 havior patterns to exhibit while en route to the meeting place or in
 its area.  Some have approached our case officers at places not stipu-
 lated as meeting sites, have telephoned the case officer at his office and
 discussed personal contact arrangements, or have showed up in per-
 son at the Soviet installation to see the case officer.

 Regardless of how skillful and vigilant a case officer may be, he
 can come to the attention of counterintelligence if one of his agents
 violates operational rules deliberately or neglects them because of
 inexperience.  Furthermore, the agent's attitude toward cover and
 clandestinity when meeting with his case officer contributes to some
 degree to the over-all assessment of his sincerity and honesty in col-
 laborating with Soviet intelligence.  Some agents, of course, work
 honestly with us without adhering to the basic rules of security on
 the premise that no kind of surveillance is being directed at them.
 Nevertheless the case officer must always consider the agent's attitude
 toward security and train and indoctrinate him accordingly.  He must
 seek out the reasons for every deviation by the agent from the norms
 of behavior he has laid down.
 Planning a Meeting
 The preparation of a meeting plan is done by the handling case
 officer with the guidance of the resident or his deputy. It begins with
 the meeting's objectives and tasks, including specific problems to be
 resolved with the agent, the ways and order of their solution, and
 operational or personal problems which the agent may have and
 which should be settled at the meeting.  If the meeting place and
 time previously selected are not suitable for the accomplishment of
 these tasks or for current operational conditions, then it is proper
 to make changes. The agent should be informed in advance by non-
 personal contact or at the agreed time and place during a. brief
 contact.  The latter procedure is the better if the scheduled meeting
 is imminent; it avoids confusion and possible broken contact.  If it
 is possible that surveillance of the handling officer may endanger the
 meeting, then he can be replaced by another handler.
 The case officer must study the operational climate on the route
 of travel and in the area of the meeting place.  He must be prepared
 to take correct stock of the situation on the spot and in case of neces-
 sity make the proper security decisions.  Some case officers panic
 when complications arise in the operational situation in the vicinity
 of the meeting place.  Some officers suspecting surveillance either
 continue according to plan, attaching no significance to their suspi-
 cions, or completely abandon the meeting without activating planned
 measures to get to the bottom of the situation.  If the latter., they
 frequently head for the automobile that brought them to the meeting
 area instead of going home, thus giving counterintelligence the oppor-

 tunity to identify another intelligence officer, the one at the wheel
 of the parked automobile.  Another mistake is for the case officer,
 instead of leaving the meeting area by a route designed to avoid
 encountering the agent, to take a direction that results in confronta-
 tion with him.  Not suspecting danger (incidentally, the need for
 danger signals is not always anticipated), the agent goes right up
 to the case officer; and counterintelligence has caught them in contact.
 The plan will include reaffirmation or replacement of agreed meet-
 ing arrangements and signals, the cover story for the meeting and
 the sequence of actions to be taken to substantiate it, assessment of
 the personal qualities of the agent and observation of his behavior,
 the sequence of actions to be used in checking the operational climate
 in the meeting area beforehand and afterward, and in case of need
 a check on the agent's honesty. It will include the sequence of moves
 to be made in the event the agent does not appear or if complications
 arise while the case officer is en route to the meeting area, approach-
 ing the meeting site, or actually with the agent.  Finally, it will
 include arrangements with the support elements assigned to provide
 security for the meeting and the danger signals agreed upon.
 After he has thought over and clarified all of these elements, the
 officer should make a written outline of his plan and schedule of
 action.  This will help him to resolve all problems and accomplish
 his mission completely and clandestinely in the briefest possible
 period of time.
 The departure of a case officer for an agent meeting is critical when
 he is under legal cover in a capitalist country with stringent counter-
 intelligence practices.  Preparations can be made approximately as
 follows.
 Several days before the scheduled meeting the residency, using sup-
 port means and other available assets, studies the status of the case
 officer with respect to the presence of counterintelligence surveillance.
 Also studied are the counterintelligence personnel and technical assets
 being used against the Soviet installations, especially the counter-
 intelligence officers assigned to follow the given case officer.  Trial
 exits of the case officer into the city are made in order to determine
 the nature and extent of surveillance.  Similar exits are made simul-
 taneously by other case officers in order to determine as completely
 as possible the intensity of surveillance and to see whether the coun-
 Approved For Release 2005/01/05 :
 74                                             SECRET
 terintelligence assets assigned to the given officer are withdrawn and
 reassigned to follow the others.
 The case officer who is to hold the meeting "trains" counterintelli-
 gence personnel to a habitual daily schedule of movements in order to
 take the edge off their vigilance.  It may be useful to deviate from
 this daily pattern sometimes in order to test how the counterintelli-
 gence personnel react, but one should never "play" with the counter-
 intelligence agents and tease them by acts ostensibly designed to
 shake surveillance.
 On the basis of data collected by these measures steps are worked
 out for the officer to make a secure exit into the city to hold the
 meeting (or to forewarn the agent if he discovers surveillance). A
 system of signals is agreed upon and an appropriate distribution of
 security and support personnel is worked out.  For the latter, other
 case officers and technical personnel in the residency are co-opted,
 ones not subject to intensive counterintelligence surveillance.
 For the exit itself various techniques of camouflage are used.  In
 one case, talks indicating the case officer was ill were held several
 times during the day over a telephone known to be tapped by the
 counterintelligence service.  The state of his health was being dis-
 cussed again over the telephone at the very time when he was leaving
 his home to meet an agent, so early that surveillance teams had not
 yet started to work.  In another instance the officer was hidden in an
 automobile and driven by two other members of the residency to a
 place where one of the two was taking driving lessons.  The counter-
 intelligence agents, who for some time had been used to watching this
 car leave for the driving lessons, now trailed it for a while and then
 fell for the cover story and discontinued surveillance.
 Once a "party" was arranged in the apartment of a case officer
 who was scheduled to meet with an illegal.  Counterintelligence,
 believing the cover story and supposing that all residency person-
 nel subject to surveillance were safely assembled in this one place,
 relaxed vigilance.  Taking advantage of their relaxation, the "host"
 went out by a secret exit, held his meeting, and returned the same
 way.  He resumed entertaining his "guests" and then conducted them
 down to the street before the very eyes of the counterintelligence
 agents, leaving the impression he had been in the apartment with his
 comrades all the time.
 In order to weaken surveillance over a case officer who is about to
 leave for an agent meeting, other members of the residency are some-

 times sent into town in order to disperse the strength of the surveil-
 lance teams and distract their attention.  The invention of successful
 camouflage devices depends on the use of initiative and resourceful-
 ness in the light of the specific concrete situation.
 Surveillance en Route
 Automobiles and residency members on foot can be used for signal-
 ing danger to the case officer going to a meeting.  They are stationed
 at prearranged points, the men perhaps making calls from specified
 telephone booths.  Everything is calculated as to time and place.
 The case officer may be required to go to a stipulated point at a given
 time or be at a given place in order to observe what kind of a signal
 is set up there.  If our automobile, for example, were parked at a
 specified point, this would signify that the case officer was under
 surveillance and should not keep the rendezvous.  In working out
 such safeguards they should be so calculated as to warn the case officer
 in time for him to call off the operation before making contact with
 the agent.
 Secret technical devices are used to detect surveillance on case
 officers going to an agent meeting.?  Carefully selected residency
 employees can also be sent out to test operational conditions along
 the handling officer's route, at particular points to be passed, and in
 the area of the meeting place.  This must be done, however, without
 attracting superfluous persons into the meeting area and without
 drawing counterintelligence attention to it.  In some cases such pro-
 cedures are coordinated on the spot with residents of fellow intelli-
 gence organs.8  Sometimes employees supporting the meeting of a
 case officer with an agent are subjected to more intense surveillance
 than the case officer himself and so pull the counterintelligence "tails"
 along after them to the meeting.  In this fashion security support is
 converted into its opposite, and the operation has to be called off.
 The case officer departing for a meeting is required to check care-
 fully whether he himself is under surveillance.  If he is, he must con-
 vince the surveillants by his actions that his trip into town has no
 intelligence connotations; that is, he must act in conformity with the
 approved cover story or its alternate.  He must also try to shake off
 the surveillants.  It is not proper, however, to let it be evident that

 he is trying to shake them off, especially if the meeting is with a
 valuable agent. Obvious efforts usually do not work.  On the con-
 trary, they charge the atmosphere around the case officer and bring
 on counterintelligence reinforcements.
 The officer can go on to the meeting only after careful checking and
 making fully certain that there is no surveillance.  When surveillance
 is discovered and when it is impossible to get away from it naturally,
 he should calmly abort the meeting.
 The Meeting
 Upon meeting the agent, the case officer first tells him the cover
 story for their being together and then establishes arrangements for
 future contact.  After that the business specified in the meeting plan
 can be taken up.  If the plan calls for the return of intelligence mate.
 rials to the agent, these are given to him immediately.  But if it
 calls for the case officer to get materials from the agent, it is best
 for him to take them at the last moment, just before the meeting ends.
 Then, when counterintelligence activity is severe, he must get rid
 of them as quickly as possible.  For this purpose support automo-
 biles or other members of the residency are sometimes stationed at
 predetermined points in order to take them from him.
 Various techniques are used to effect the transfer of intelligence
 materials.  They can be thrown into the open window of a parked
 automobile.  They can be passed outside of town between two cars
 in motion, one overtaking the other and running side by side with it
 for a brief span.  Heavy suitcases containing radio gear, for example,
 can be handed over in this way.  Or the exchange can be accom-
 plished under the pretext that one car is helping the other make
 repairs.  Under present conditions, however, residencies under legal
 cover should receive and pass materials whenever possible via non-
 personal forms of communication with the aid of technical opera-
 tional equipment.)
 After the meeting has ended the case officer may, if special per-
 mission has been obtained from the resident, check on the actions
 of the agent by discreet, unnoticeable surveillance.  This practice
 obtains when something in his behavior and performance gives rise
 to suspicion.

 Upon return to the residency the case officer makes a detailed oral
 report to the resident, and if asked he writes a report for transmittal
 to Headquarters including his own comments and conclusions. The
 resident adds his comments before sending it.
 Under Better Conditions
 Meetings with an agent in a third country are planned and con-
 ducted in compliance with all the requirements of cover and clan-
 destinity applicable to agent meetings everywhere.  This applies
 especially when a Headquarters officer has traveled there with Soviet
 documentation to hold the meeting.  In a third country, however,
 the operational climate is more favorable in that the counterintelli-
 gence and police agents do not know the identity of either the case
 officer or the agent.  Moreover, neither the case officer nor the agent
 has acquaintances among the local populace, with whom an encounter
 during a meeting would be most undesirable.  The agent feels more
 confident and relaxed, a circumstance which facilitates a more com-
 plete and thorough examination and resolution of the business at hand.
 A third country is usually chosen that has less stringent counter-
 intelligence practices, one where the operational situation permits
 holding a meeting with less risk of discovery. The case officer who
 arrives in a third country illegally, with foreign documentation, enjoys
 still more favorable conditions, not only for meetings but also for
 non-clandestine association with the agent.  The two can even live
 in the same hotel.  Nevertheless, a case officer meeting an agent in
 a third country must carefully adhere to all the rules of clandestine
 intelligence operations.
 In illegal residencies and agent groups, meetings with agents should
 conform to the same requirements, even though conditions are differ-
 ent and security measures normally do not have to be carried to such
 lengths.  The establishment of personal contact in illegal residencies
 and agent groups . is under the control of Headquarters, and residents
 and group leaders report on meetings to Headquarters through their
 communications channels.
 Meetings with an agent summoned from abroad to Headquarters
 enjoy the most favorable conditions of all, held in a safehouse and
 in a calm atmosphere which provide the opportunity to thrash out
 problems thoroughly and resolve pending operational matters.  Such
 meetings establish conditions for definitive checking and assessment
 of the agent, should this be necessary.  They entail, however, acute

 problems of security and cover, especially when the agent is quartered
 in a hotel with other foreigners.  His contacts with Soviet officials
 must not become known to outsiders, especially his own countrymen.
 If he arrives with false documentation, he should be quartered in a
 safehouse only, and he should not appear in those places where
 citizens of his country might meet him.  His exit from the USSR
 also requires serious attention.  He cannot take an airplane or train
 on which acquaintances might happen to be traveling.
 Despite its obvious vulnerability, personal contact in agent opera-
 tions is unavoidable.  It must be used most intensively for recruitment
 purposes.  It has a number of advantages over other modes of agent
 communication. It facilitates the exchange of materials, the assessment
 of potential agents, and agent indoctrination and training.  It is a
 means of direct supervision, which is extraordinarily important and
 necessary in intelligence operations, especially in the protection of the
 network from penetration by provocateurs and counterintelligence
 agents.
 It is used primarily within residencies.  It is also used by Head-
 quarters for communication with agents, group leaders, and illegal
 residents, especially in peacetime.  It can seldom be the means of
 delivering urgent intelligence reports, however, and therefore even in
 peacetime arrangements for radio and other forms of non-personal
 communication with Headquarters must be established.
 Much is demanded of case officers making personal contacts-
 excellence in operational preparedness, personality, education, ,and
 general cultural development, knowledge of specialized matters on
 which the agents are working, ability to detect surveillance, ability
 to grasp quickly the content and significance of a discussion and make
 correct decisions on matters broached by agents, and skill in avoiding
 compromise of self and agent when danger threatens.
 Because of the complexity of modern operational conditions, the
 possibilities for personal contact in a target country are significantly
 reduced and in some instances eliminated completely.  Personal
 contact with a valuable agent should take place in a third country
 or at Headquarters.

 indispensable residue of meetings in residencies under legal cover are

 residents in this respect. Yet control and supervision by Headquarters
 is never completely absent.  It is precisely the central intelligence
 apparatus which can and must, by study of experience with personal
 contacts in all strategic intelligence operations, substantially aid resi-
 dents to set up arrangements that conform with modern operational
 conditions.  Headquarters officers, residency officers, and those who
 are in intelligence training establishments must develop the highest
 creative initiative and resourcefulness in the quest for secure agent
 communications, in fitting these to actual operational problems, and
 in the application of the latest attainments of Soviet and foreign sci-
 ence and technology.

 diplomatic, consular, military and intelligence sources to their head-
 quarters.  The source and material are being checked as to probable
 authenticity both here and in London.  We shall submit later a con-
 sidered opinion on this point.  It is possible that contact: with this
 source furnishes the first important penetration into a responsible Ger-
 man agency.
 We have labeled these reports the "Boston Series" and append hereto
 the first fourteen.2

 in a branch of the Reich Foreign Ministry, in Edward P. Morgan's "The Spy
 the Nazis Missed" in True magazine for July 1950.  Morgan's story, based on
 information from "Wood," is fictionalized and inaccurate in some of its details
 but otherwise substantially correct.  It reveals that the first of Wood's reports
 were cabled from Bern to Washington in late August 1943.  Why "the first

 GERMANS SECURE BRITISH REPORTS
 Shortly prior to the 4th of November Ambassador Von Papen came
 into possession of certain documents on which he clearly places great
 value and which, seemingly, were secured from the British Embassy
 in Ankara by an important German agent.3  Among the cables was a
 list of questions which the British Ambassador took to Cairo for his
 own guidance in consulting with Eden.  Also included was a Foreign
 Office memorandum of October 7, apparently entitled, "A Long-Range
 View of Turkish-British Policy." By a special courier these and addi-
 tional documents were dispatched to Berlin.  Among these addi-
 tional documents was a memorandum presumably dealing with the
 steps which the English were taking in Turkey in preparation for war
 and which was referred to in a list of questions.

 The following order was dispatched by Keitel from General Head-

 the possession of rebels or who in any manner unite with rebels
 for mutual ends; if captured, 1) Officers are to be shot at once;
 2) Soldiers and non-commissioned officers, avoiding as much as
 possible any passage through Germany, are to be dispatched at

 TREATMENT OF ITALIAN JEWS
 On October 6, 1943, the following recommendation was made to

 for the British to take counteraction.  These were not among the first delivered,
 however; Morgan's story in True cites them as a sample of the "important news"
 with which "the secret circuit between Berlin and Bern," established after Wood
 had made two trips to Bern in person, "became heavily laden."  Cicero's own
 memoirs (Elyesa Bazna, I Was Cicero) give Wood's true name as Kolbe.

 SECRET NAZI RADIO IN DUBLIN 4
 A secret radio transmitter is located in the Nazi Legation in Dublin,
 and the Irish are aware of its existence.  Regular cables from Dublin
 are sent, with considerable delay, by way of Bern; the Nazis are
 keeping the secret transmitter for emergency use only.  The Irish. are
 putting pressure on the Nazis to give up this transmitter, but the
 Germans are stalling.  The Nazi Minister, Hempel, was of the opinion
 that he should be permitted to state to DeValera that such a crisis
 might result from the Irish insisting on the surrender of the transmitter
 that it might result in the recall of Hempel, thereby causing a decrease
 in the independence now enjoyed by Ireland in relations with England.
 NOTE: With reference to the above report, OSS is now advised by its London
 Office that this transmitter was removed on December 24th by the Government
 of Eire.
 INTERNMENT OF GERMAN FLIERS IN EIRE
 The German Government in December proposed that, to avoid
 being interned, Nazi airmen landing in Ireland should claim that they
 are on a practice flight.  Munitions and bombs are to be dropped over-
 board prior to landing.                                                                                                         On the basis of such actions by Nazi fliers,
 the German Government is to request that DeValera release all Nazi
 airmen who land in Ireland from now on.  Then perhaps a civilian
 airplane could fly to Ireland for the purpose of picking up these fliers,
 thereby affording the German Government a chance to send a new
 German official to Dublin.
 NOTE: With reference to the above report, OSS had been advised from London
 that, whether or not German aviators were engaged in "nonoperational" flights,
 everyone has been interned on landing and they will continue to be interned.
 ' Morgan puts the delivery of a fancifully embroidered version of this document
 not with the initial take but as one of Wood's reasons for making-still in 1.943,
 "late October"-his second trip in person to Ber?

 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 The following paraphrase comes from German sources, the ultimate
 source allegedly being the German Foreign Office. It purports to be
 a report to Berlin by the German Minister to Switzerland, embodying
 the substance of a report from the Swiss Minister in Washington to
 the Swiss Foreign Office:
 "1..K. O. Schweiz [Note: Kriegs Organization, the Swiss secret in-
 telligence agency]5 has seen reports of the Swiss Minister, which were
 based upon talks with the Vice President.?  According to these reports,
 at the start of the Moscow Conference the Americans and British tried
 to vindicate both the past and future actions of the Allied GHQ's;
 however, their Russian partner exhibited practically no sympathy or
 appreciation of their position.  On the other hand, it seems that the
 foundations were laid for coming military cooperation.  Not until a
 second front has been opened up, i.e., not until the Allies have carried
 out a successful invasion of France, will this plan for cooperation go
 into effect.  Until then Russia retains the right to unrestricted action
 in military and political matters.  The Vice President stated, how-
 ever, that Russian conditions for more complete military cooperation
 will soon be met.
 10. The report of the Swiss Minister is a valuable supplement to
 the reports from friendly diplomats which I [the German Minister to
 Switzerland] sent earlier.  The reason that the above report contains
 so much more concrete information than the data which came to Bern
 from the American and British governments is due to the fact that the
 Vice President was talking to the Swiss Minister, his brother-in-law,
 in the greatest confidence."7
 `Erroneous.  K. 0. Schweiz would be the German Abwehr station in Switzer-
 land.

 The V-Weapons
 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 10 July 1.944
 Here is a message just received through OSS in Berne from our in-
 formant strategically placed in Berlin:
 "1. With reference to the rocket bombs, extremely secret in-
 formation from Pari (Koerperbau) 8 reveals that the 'gerade Lau-
 fapparatur' ? is produced in Gdynia, at the Ascania works; both
 the V-1 and V-2 models are made in Hersograd (sic), which is
 located in Niederdonau10 in the vicinity of St. Valentin; the
 `Duesen''1 are built at the Krupp works in Wuppertal; additional
 parts which are not named are manufactured by the Siemens-
 plauia 12 factories at Murtenberglech (sic) 13, situated 30 kilo-
 meters north of Augsburg.
 "2. Approximately 10% of the V-1 model rocket bombs will
 have short-wave transmitters installed in them.  The purpose of
 this will be to direct the path and aim of the rocket bomb.  The
 problem which arises with respect to this, however, is whether
 waves transmitted from England will be able to interfere with the
 apparatus.
 "3. To the best of the informant's knowledge, Berlin has not
 been able to obtain any first-hand information regarding con-
 sequences of the bombing of southern England.  They have se-
 cured the following indirect reports, however, through third
 persons:
 "(A) On June 29th, von Papen wired Berlin that be was in-
 formed in confidence by the Deputy General Secretary that al-
 though England has ended the suspension of diplomatic privileges
 and although the Turkish government has asked its Embassy at
 London for a report on this topic, still no report has been received.

 Britain has requested all diplomatic representatives stationed in
 England not to transmit any information regarding the invasion
 situation and the Nazi weapon.
 "(B) From Madrid, Ambassador Dieckhoff wired the following
 on July 2nd: In the last two days, the initial results of the rocket
 bombing of southern England have become a great deal graver.
 If this bombing is maintained, it is anticipated that there will be
 heavy damage and disorder, even though public services have not
 yet been halted.  Dieckhoff's information was based on a cable
 from Alba which reached Madrid on July 1.
 "4. In the neighborhood of Orlamuende, south of Kahla on the
 railroad line between Rudolfstadt and Jena, a large new airplane
 plant is being built.  It is underground in part.  It was already
 bombed on either June 29th or 30th, but this raid did not cause
 much injury and the plant will soon be in operation.  Pursuit
 planes (Jagd maschinen) are manufactured here; in addition, per-
 haps new secret weapons are also produced.  In comparison with
 the V-1 model, the V-2 travels through the stratosphere.  It is
 radio-controlled and is therefore a more accurate weapon.  In
 addition, it possesses a longer range.  This new model will be in
 use by the Nazis within 60 days, at the outside."
 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 We have just received through our representative in Bern the fol-
 lowing report from a reliable source inside Germany, concerning the
 characteristics of the German V-2 bomb:
 "A-4 is the designation applied to the V-2 bomb by the experts, but
 there are many conflicting reports concerning it. It is reported to be
 manufactured at Saint Gallen in Austria southeast of Steyr.  The parts
 are assembled at MDW (Mittel-Deutschen Werke) Harz (sic) and
 all buildings for this work are located beneath the earth.   The most
 effective way to cripple this production would be to smash the lines
 for rail shipment.  The weapon is claimed to be capable of a speed
 of 1 kilometer per second and to sustain itself in flight for a distance
 of 500 to 600 kilometers.  It carries anywhere from 1 to 2 tons of
 explosive charges and has a weight of about 20 tons.  It is not directed

 by remote control, however.  The fuse is manufactured in Moertingen
 near Augsburg.  The bomb is propelled from steel plates wl-iich are
 mounted on a movable track. The Germans are said to be all ready to
 employ the weapon in Norway.  On October 3, a wire was sent by
 General Jodal 14 to the Oberbefehlshaber in the West that this is not a
 propitious time, politically, to launch these bombs against Paris, and
 no attack should be made in that region now.  It is the opinion of
 everyone that any talk of other so-named V weapons is mere propa-
 ganda, or, at least if there are such bombs, they will not be ready for
 use till March or April next year.  If the V-1 or V-2 are directed by
 remote control they use a wave length frequency of 24 to 56 centi-
 meters.  Operations have been resumed at Peenemuende."

 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 The enclosed dispatch from Berne and the accompanying evaluation
 of its source should, it is believed, be brought to your attention as
 early as possible.
 You will recall earlier copies of a special character which were
 secured from original official German sources through our Agency in
 Switzerland.  This cable is not such a message but it is the evaluation
 by our principal Swiss intelligence representative16 of two hundred
 such enemy documents (four hundred pages) which have just come
 into his hands.
 As is customary with material of such special character these en-
 closures are also being delivered personally to the Secretary of State,
 General Marshall, Admiral King, General Eisenhower and the Secre-
 tary of the Joint Chiefs.
 Under existing arrangements on this particular contact the British
 will see this cable and, as in the past, will doubtless show it to their
 highest officials.

 MEMORANDUM TO ACCOMPANY 2787-92 ATTACHED
 With regard to the attached message which left Bern April 12th,
 the following is to be said.
 (1) The author of message is an American citizen, 52 years
 old, in charge of OSS secret intelligence in Switzerland since
 November 1942.  His intimate knowledge of European politics
 dates back to 1915.  During the last war he acted as an intel-
 ligence officer for the United States Government from the Lega-
 tion in Switzerland.                  Subsequently, he represented the United
 States officially on several occasions in important diplomatic nego-
 tiations.  During the last 30 years he has had a continuing expert
 and responsible interest in European affairs.
 (2) All "Boston" (Kappa) material has been handled per-
 sonally by him in Switzerland since it first appeared in October
 1943.17
 (3) The sender of this message has hitherto acted merely as
 a reporter of material received by him, transmitting it as it
 reached him, and only occasionally making a brief note of com-
 ment on some point of fact or on some individual named in
 Boston material.
 (4) His last previous evaluation, a month ago (not based
 primarily on earlier Boston material), was conservative and by no
 means optimistic with regard to the possibility of an early Ger-
 man internal collapse.
 (5) As a man experienced in affairs, he knows how significant
 the attached message may be and the responsibility he assumes
 by sending it.
 (6) However, in view of the very great implications in this
 message, a cable has been sent to the author requesting him to
 review it carefully to see whether he wishes, on reflection, to
 modify any of its language and to report here by cable im-
 mediately.
 (7) It would seem that the author, thanks to the sudden receipt
 of 400 pages of material all at one moment, finds himself in a posi-
 tion where he can see the whole picture rather than any single
 'This date splits the difference between the actual first appearance in August
 and the first dissemination in January 1944.  The volume of reporting did in-
 crease in October with Wood's second trip to Bern.

 part.  He is probably better able to see and evaluate that whole
 picture than the Germans are themselves, since they have neither
 the time nor the calm nor the undistracted minds to take an over-
 all view of their own diplomatic situation.
 (8) You will be further informed when and if any modification
 of this message comes from Bern.
 Sincerely regret that you cannot at this time see Wood's material as it stands
 without condensation and abridgement.  In some 400 pages, dealing with the
 internal maneuverings of German diplomatic policy for the past two months, a
 picture of imminent doom and final downfall is presented.  Into a tormented
 General Headquarters and a half-dead Foreign Office stream the lamentations
 of a score of diplomatic posts.  It is a scene wherein haggard Secret Service and
 diplomatic agents are doing their best to cope with the defeatism and desertion
 of flatly defiant satellites and allies and recalcitrant neutrals.  The period of secret
 service under Canaris and diplomacy under the champagne salesman is drawing to
 an end. Already Canaris has disappeared from the picture, and a conference was
 hurriedly convoked in Berlin at which efforts were made to mend the gaping holes
 left in the Abwehr.  Unable now to fall back on his favorite means of avoiding
 disconcerting crises by retiring to his bed, Ribbentrop has beat a retreat: to Fuschl
 and retains a number of his principal aides at Salzburg.  The remainder of the
 Foreign Office is strung out all the way between Riesengebirge and the capital.
 Almost impossible working conditions exist in the latter, and bombing shelters are
 being permanently used for code work.  Once messages have been deciphered,
 a frantic search begins to locate the particular service or minister to which each
 cable must be forwarded; and, when a reply is called for, another search is neces-
 sary to deliver this to the right place.
 Borman or Neubacher will step forward if Ribbentrop is sacked, and one of
 them will carry out Gestapo diplomacy. Ample evidence of what this will mean
 is contained in 100-odd pages of Weesenmeyer cables describing the situation in
 the Hungarian capital.  There, however, the drama involves that old fox, Horthy,
 playing the role of a 1944 Petain.  Weesenmeyer's cable dated the 20th of last
 month ends on the following querulous note: "Within the last 24 hours, I have
 had three long talks with Von Iorthy.  As a result, I am becoming more and
 more convinced that on the one hand the Regent is an unmitigated liar and on
 the other he is physically no longer capable of performing his duties.  He is con-
 stantly repeating himself, often contradicting himself within a few sentences, and
 sometimes does not know how to go on.  Everything he says sounds like a
 memorized formula, and I fear that it will be difficult to convince him, let alone
 win him over."
 In Sofia, cagy Bulgarians are playing all kinds of tricks on Beckerle and going
 off to Turkey on pleasure trips, while Nazi offices are accusing each other right
 and left of letting traitors clear out from under their noses.  In Bucharest,
 Antonescu's harried aides try to think up excuses for the Stirbey-Chastelain in-
 cidents that will satisfy the Nazis, while the Marshall himself is getting reports
 that looting German troops are just ahead of the Russians.
 The final death-bed contortions of a putrefied Nazi diplomacy are pictured in
 these telegrams.  The reader is carried from one extreme of emotion to the other.

 from tears to laughter, as he examines these messages and sees the cruelty ex-
 hibited by the Germans in their final swan-song of brutality toward the peoples so
 irrevocably and pitifully enmeshed by the Gestapo after half a decade of futile
 struggles, and yet at the same time sees also the absurdity of the dilemma which
 now confronts this diplomacy both within and outside of Festung Europa.
 19 April 1944
 In connection with the message from Switzerland (transmitted to
 you on 15 April 1944) giving an appreciation of the German political
 and diplomatic situation rendered by the principal OSS intelligence
 officer, Switzerland, he was immediately queried as to whether he
 wished to modify or add to that message, in view of its import.  He
 has now replied.
 He states:
 (1) That he sees no reason to change or qualify his earlier message
 as a description of the current Nazi diplomatic and political scene.
 (2) That though his evaluation is derived most immediately from
 the material recently received by him, and from conversations with
 one tried informant, he has received other similar reports recently
 from other well-proven informants in the same strain, and background
 data to him in Bern supports his view.
 He adds:
 That his message should not be read as indicating that the morale
 of the Nazi army is nearing collapse (excepting probably the so-called
 Gross Deutscher, Slav and other non-German elements).  Nor does
 he think that any important Nazi military officials are ready and
 willing to let us come in through the West unopposed.  He believes,
 rather, that fierce opposition may be given to any invasion attempt.
 A collapse of Germany might follow, however, a few months after
 the establishment of a firm toe-hold in the West.
 He concludes :
 The timing of the invasion attempt may be all important.  The
 German people are war-weary and apathetic, and even in Nazi circles
 the same kind of psychological depression can be seen as appeared
 last August and September.
 Yet if they could stabilize the Russian front once more, they might
 catch a second wind, and put up an even stronger defense against
 invasion.

 LETTERS TO THE PRESIDENT
 Walter Pforzheimer
 On the following pages are reproduced two letters written in August
 1863 to President Jefferson Davis by Rose O'Neal Greenhow, prewar
 Washington socialite who became, as the chronic North-South quarrel
 flamed into armed hostilities, a celebrated propagandist, intrigante,
 and espionage agent for the Confederacy.  To her information on
 Union troop movements is credited the Southern victory at First
 Manassas. Arrested by Pinkerton in August 1861, she was imprisoned
 for nearly a year, then "exiled" to Richmond. Now she is on her way
 to Europe, commissioned by Davis to try to rekindle sympathy for the
 South in the cooling governments of France and England.  The letter
 from Bermuda has not been reproduced before.'
 It was in returning from this mission, after a year of personally
 triumphant effort in behalf of a cause that was too far gone to save,
 that the writer died in the service of her country.  Running the
 blockade and pursued by a Union gunboat, her ship ran aground in
 a storm, but within the protective range of Confederate guns.  'Too
 impetuous to wait for calming waters, she insisted on putting to shore
 in a boat and drowned when it overturned.

 St. George Bermuda
 August 19th
 I have been detained here for the last ten days awaiting a vessel for Europe.
 I had concluded by advise of Maj. Walker to go on the Harriet Pinkney, a vessel
 which sails with English papers and with English officers and leaves in a few days
 for Liverpool.  But yesterday a person whose position enables him to know most
 things came to me confidentially and told me that a decision had been given by
 Crown lawyers in England that all vessels on the high seas carrying cotton were
 lawfully liable to capture altho the vessel and cargo should be owned by
 British subjects, and that Col. Monroe, the officer in command here, admitted
 that such instructions had been sent out, altho with the injunction of secrecy.  I
 have no doubt at all of the accuracy of this as the intelligence and reliability of
 my informant is without question.
 Today I am going to address a note to the Gov. asking for information on the
 subject & stating my object of going on a British vessel &c.  The Lee has just
 got in, having had a hard trip and being obliged to throw 150 bales of cotton
 overboard.  If I elicit a response to my letter I shall send it. For if this be the
 case the blockade is also in British waters.
 Our Agent Maj. Walker has a very delicate and difficult post here.  I have
 informed myself thoroughly as to the business &c. here, and I feel that I cannot
 give him too much credit for his indefatigable zeal and ready resources. One of
 the greatest difficulties is the procuring of funds in gold or silver, there being no
 Bank on the Island, and I really have felt for his difficulty this last ten days,
 there having been cleared fifteen vessels which each had to have their share of
 the sterling.  I will not take up your time which I know is so valuable, but I
 thought it proper to communicate this information which I know can be relied
 upon.
 With my prayers and my best wishes.  Believe me most truly and respectfully.

 INTELLIGENCE IN RECENT PUBLIC LITERATURE
 THE FORTRESS THAT NEVER WAS: The Myth of Hitler's Bavar-
 ian Stronghold.  By Rodney G. Minott.  (New York: Holt, Rine-
 hart and Winston.  1964.  208 pp.  $4.95.)
 The thesis of this book, which is based on study of Allied intel-
 ligence reports and some German documents, is that General Eisen-
 bower's Supreme Headquarters became so obsessed in the spring of
 1945 with fear of a prospective German redoubt in the Bavarian Alps
 as to drop plans to take Berlin and Vienna.  The author, described
 on the dust wrapper as a young American historian currently teaching
 at Stanford, does not know what he is writing about.
 Perhaps Mr. Minott was influenced by Chester Wilmot's The
 Struggle for Europe,' which, following the British line, blames Eisen-
 hower for not capturing Berlin, Prague, and Vienna and makes con-
 cern over the purported redoubt one of the principal reasons for not
 driving more aggressively to the east.  William L. Shirer, in his gen-
 erally authoritative Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, also says that
 Eisenhower and his staff were obsessed with the urgency of capturing
 the so-called National Redoubt, although it "was a phantom.  It never
 existed except in the propaganda blasts of Dr. Goebbels and in the
 cautious minds at Eisenhower's headquarters ..."
 With this encouragement the young author, pontificating that
 "intelligence evaluations of all types from the tactical up to the na-
 tional level are incredibly important for our defense in this age,"
 tries to make something out of nothing, and fails.  It is true that
 there was a lot of talk about a planned National Redoubt in the
 Bavarian Alps, talk by the Germans and by American and British in-
 telligence.  Shirer indicates the command attitude toward it in quot-
 ? ing Omar Bradley's statement that it was "too ominous a threat to
 ignore." Eisenhower writes in his Crusade in Europe, "The evidence
 was clear that the Nazi intended to make the attempt and I decided
 to give him no opportunity to carry it out....  The way to stop this
 project . . . was to overrun the entire national territory before its
 organization could be effected." And that is exactly what was done.
 It is true that the German project had not got off the ground.  It
 is absolutely untrue that the preventive action affected the rest of
 Allied strategy in any way.  One army group, unemployed, was di-

 verted to clean out the area of potential danger.  This, the Sixth
 Army Group under General Devers, was unemployed because the
 enemy had been destroyed and because there wasn't room on the
 roads or supplies for further advances to the east. One division, in
 fact, the 13th U.S. Airborne assigned to the Army Group for this task,
 had acquired distinction as the only U.S. division sent to Europe that
 never had anything to do-not of its own choosing, of course.
 Mr. Minott suggests that if we had had enough intelligence analysts
 to study the matter we wouldn't have been taken in by the stronghold
 myth.  He is off base on three counts.  First, we weren't taken in.
 Second, you don't stop fighting a war to await the results of a research
 project. And third, if we were "obsessed" or even very much worried
 about the danger, I who was General Bradley's G-2 briefing officer at
 Tactical Headquarters wasn't aware of it.  Certainly we wanted to
 make sure that there was no problem on our right flank, but anything
 beyond that takes our concern out of context.
 It's a commander's job to anticipate all problems, and that's what
 Eisenhower and Bradley did here without detriment to any other task.
 We had divisions and corps to spare.  It would have been wrong to
 dismiss the redoubt as a myth on the strength of intelligence analysis.
 Intelligence cannot be omniscient; maybe Mr. Minott's book is about
 the wrong profession.

 TIIE GESTAPO: A History of Horror.    By Jacques Delarue.  Trans-
 lated from the French Histoire de la Gestapo (Librairie Artheme
 Fayard, 1962) by Mervyn Savill.  Published in England (London:
 Macdonald, 1964) under title The History of the Gestapo.   (New
 York: William Morrow.  1964.  384 pp.   $6.95.)
 This purported history of the Nazi political police boils over not
 only into an account of the Reich intelligence and security services
 generally, along with the SS and other instruments of oppression, but
 into a wide-ranging treatment of the rise and eventual triumph of the
 Nazi party, the consolidation of its dictatorship in Germany and its
 preparations for conquest, the atrocities of the occupation, and the
 final cataclasm that began with the plot of 20 July.  The author, who
 was a member of the Paris Surete, a resistance worker, a Nazi prisoner,
 and then postwar liquidator of occupation records for the Surete, is too
 unskillful a writer and too careless a historian-he says for example
 that Mussolini was "a refugee in Germany" in July 1944-to bring any

 new perspectives to the familiar material he resplashes on this broader
 canvas.  The value of his work is thus confined to the two chapters
 reflecting his own experience and documentary studies, those on the
 SIPO-SD units in France. Even here the pickings are pretty slim, the
 prize exhibit being a hitherto unpublished jurisdictional agreement
 with the Vichy police, which in any case was not honored.
 What is remarkable about the book in its English-language versions
 is that the British and American publishers were satisfied with such a
 clumsy, dictionary translation and such a sloppy job of editing.  When
 the author begs leave to tell of his personal memories, he "hopes the
 reader will excuse him from recounting . . ." Himmler was unwilling
 to "participate" (for share) his control of the police.  Stenographers
 are "shorthand typists."  A cell is a "casemate"; prison rules are a
 "material regime."    Cruel regulations are called "insensate."  News-
 papers are "presses."                                                                                                                    The Gestapo had "integrated" (for absorbed)
 units of the SD.  The RSHA had "a special formation" (i.e. course
 of training) for all agents.  "I could not tell from his glance if he was
 still alive."  Ostmark is "the Eastern Marches."  "Woe to the journa-
 list who dared write a misplaced allusion."
 A few of these are edited out in the British edition.  The American
 editors passed all of them and many more, along with some Briticisms
 and a lot of plain errors.  The Schupo is the "urban police correspond-
 ing to our constables."                                                                                                                   March is specified when it should be Feb-
 ruary; we get A.M. for P.M., 1944 for 1943, francs for marks, political
 forces for police forces.   Czechoslovakia is to evacuate "the Sudeten
 Germans" rather than Sudeten Germany.  1Ieydrich's assassin is mis-
 spelled "Gabeik" in both editions.  "Hitler was dominated . . . by
 the conflict against the `Reds,' in other words the Democrats and. the
 Republicans."  Stool pigeons had been "baptized 'wel]-wishers,"'
 whereas "well-wishers had been baptized V. Maenner, in other words
 men of trust."'
 In justice, one cannot have expected editors to catch some of the
 errors which must have been made in the original French.  Schel-
 lenberg's man Hoettl is said to have made contacts in Berne with
 General Donovan.  Beck's being passed over as replacement for von
 Fritsch in 1938 is attributed to a speech he made in 1934. And details
 for the installation of the first gas chambers-that would be 1940-
 are said to have been decided over lunches held in EicbmaDn'S office
 after "the Allied bombing had seriously damaged all the [RSHA]
 buildings" in Berlin-which could not be before 1944.

 The book seems to represent a lot of honest effort on Delarue's
 part, and it isn't quite as bad as this fault-finding makes it.  But it
 isn't worth wading through, at least in this translation.

 Tl:IEIR TRADE IS TREACHERY. Prepared by the British Central
 Office of Information.  (London: II. M. Stationery Office.  1964.
 59 pp.  For official use only.)
 Much better than its garish title promises, this is a counterintel-
 ligence handout for British government employees.  Its principal con-
 tent is a score of sanitized case histories which show how the Soviet
 and Bloc services go about the spotting and recruitment of indigenous
 agents, what action some prospects they approach take to escape
 entrapment, and how others fail to escape.  The treatment is light
 and the style simple, featuring the one-short-sentence paragraph of
 the preschool book:
 Gorski and Zaremba were interrogated.
 The dangers were explained.
 Zaremba never went to Poland.  He didn't want to, now....
 Lucky Zaremba.
 This playful rendering of the earnest message, together with the in-
 trinsic interest of the case histories, keeps the reader's attention and
 lets him enjoy being preached to.        Except for the inevitable lecture
 on physical security at the end (you'd think they could have handed
 that out separately) it is skillful propaganda, and universal enough
 to be suitable for U.S. use if our own CI propagandists are all too
 heavy-handed for this kind of job.

 THE STUDIES IN INTELLIGENCE AWARD
 An annual award of $500 is offered for the most significant contribu-
 tion to the literature of intelligence submitted for publication in the
 Studies.  The prize may be divided if the two or more best articles
 submitted are judged to be of equal merit, or it may be withheld if
 no article is deemed sufficiently outstanding.
 Except as may be otherwise announced from year to year, articles
 on any subject within the range of the Studies' purview, as defined in
 its masthead, will be considered for the award.  They will be judged
 primarily on substantive originality and soundness, secondarily on
 literary qualities.  Members of the Studies editorial board and staff
 are of course excluded from the competition.
 Awards are normally announced in the first issue (Winter) of each
 volume for articles published during the preceding calendar year.  The
 editorial board will welcome readers' nominations for awards, but re-
 serves to itself exclusive competence in the decision.

 The main job of the interpreter accompanying a Soviet delegation
 around this country is to facilitate communication.  He should. not
 be so loaded with other assignments that he reaches the point of
 exhaustion in which, as a Soviet interpreter once put it, he feels like
 a wise dog-he understands everything but cannot say a word.
 Yet if he keeps it a secondary function he can elicit, and help in
 the elicitation of, useful information, a good deal more these days
 than in the first years of the exchange program.'  Sometimes he
 stumbles on it; sometimes he works for it and succeeds, sometimes
 fails.  And exceptionally he may be deluged with more than he
 can absorb.  How he goes about it can most easily be shown by
 holding up some pages from his life.
 As I near the top of the temporary ladder leading to the second
 floor of the new Paducah city hall, open to the sky during construc-
 tion, the December fog from the Ohio river is so thick that I cannot
 see whether the two missing members of the Soviet delegation
 are there.  Twisting around on the top rung, I now spot the two
 ghostly figures at the far end of the building-and simultaneously
 slip and nearly tumble.  I picture the headline in the Paducah paper:
 "State Department Interpreter Breaks Leg in Fall: John Dahms,
 who accompanied the Soviet delegation of 12 construction spe-
 cialists to dams and construction sites around Paducah, is said to
 be in satisfactory condition after . . .
 The slip is a warning that I am overanxious.  The reason for
 my eagerness is that these two Soviets, the most communicative of
 the 12, for the moment are alone.  All week the head of the delega-
 tion, Andrei Schepetyev, has blocked my every move to talk to
 them without his supervision.  Here is my chance. As i[ approach
 them amid the pipes, conduits, and construction debris, I can tell

 from their stance and dramatic gestures that their conversation is
 of the heart-to-heart kind.  Now I can hear it.
 Pravilno, pravilno!  Girenko is agreeing with something.  The big
 man of magnetic personality is head of some 400,000 construction
 workers in the South Ural economic district, a gold-starred Hero
 of the Soviet Union, and a delegate to the Supreme Soviet.
 "I told them, I wrote them; but it did no good," protests Denyega,
 an idealistic, obstinate, and bitter Ukrainian whose job is to coordi-
 nate the production of construction machinery throughout the USSR.
 Ile is thirty-seven but looks fifty.  The head of the delegation
 appears to hate him.
 From the commodious pockets of my trenchcoat, from among
 the neosynephrine, aspirin, cough drops, and indigestion pills there,
 I take a small box of chocolates which were to have been my break-
 fast (try ordering for a dozen hungry Russians in Paducah when
 they want real Central Asian kefir and won't settle for buttermilk
 or even yogurt) and hold it out to them.  "Chocolates, Pavel
 Gavrilovich, Andrei Yermolayevich?"  With an automatic spasibo
 they munch the candy and continue talking. Denyega, I learn,
 has written a report in which he is going to take on the entire
 Gosstroy chain of command and doesn't care what happens.
 Drug nioi, proshu vas ochen-ne goryachites. Like an old coach
 calming clown his star player, Girenko in his velvety basso tells his
 friend not to get excited and act rashly because he will only hurt
 himself.  Denyega gives a frustrated kick at an imaginary impedi-
 ment, then reluctantly concedes, "You are right.  But how long
 do we have to wait?  It is not for me.  It is for the good of all."
 "You can be sure," answers Girenko with great power of persuasion
 in his voice, "that soon there will be changes.  Enormous changes.
 Life demands it.  But right now be calm and do not criticize them."
 "Them," I think, the insiders, the politicos. I interrupt.  "I am
 glad I found you.  Shepetyev worries when you are missing."
 "Let him.  We are not children," says Denyega, just as I expected.
 "May I ask you, is this building of interest to you?  It is old-style
 custom construction, monumental type.  The last delegation from
 Gosstroy that I had was only interested in mass production methods,
 prefabricated parts and all that."
 "That's absolutely wrong," says Denyega, and Girenko nods.  "If
 our responsible people were, not so blinded by dogmatics, they would
 learn much here-they would see our weaknesses."

 "What do you mean?"
 "Rhythm, Ivan Antonovich.  Rhythm."
 I am puzzled, and both smile at me.  "Better speak Russian, not
 construction jargon," suggests Girenko, lighting another Russian long
 cigarette.
 "Look!" Denyega paints his dream, "The second floor is put on top
 of the first with all the electrical conduits and outlets, all the pipes
 already in place.  The building emerges from the ground a logical
 organic whole-like a squash coming up from the earth.  The car-
 penters, masons, electricians, assistants, truckers all work in rhythms
 doing the right thing at the right time-like players in a symphony.,
 like our great Moscow orchestra under Kondrashin.  Have you heard
 him? Now do you understand?"
 I say I do but I already knew that some buildings were quickly
 assembled in the USSR out of prefabricated parts.  What's wrong?
 Again they smile at my naivete. "True we put a building together.
 But it is only the shell.  Then come the pipefitters and poke it full
 of holes.  Then the electricians and make more holes, then the
 plumbers who usually flood it for you," explains Denyega.
 "And chip off all the plasterl" breaks in Girenko. "So before your
 customer will sign the acceptance you practically have to refinish
 the whole building, and then explain the delay to the bank and a
 myriad of supervisors.  Oh, Ivan Antonovich, you have no idea what
 unpleasant negotiations one has to carry on!  You know I have an
 ulcer, don't you?"
 "Not only buildings; even roads.         Remember the road?" asks
 Denyega, beginning to laugh.
 "Yes, the road!" roars Girenko, and then the two of them, inter-
 rupting each other and doubling over with laughter, gasp out the
 story of how 500 kilometers of a highway Girenko had just built
 were torn up so that telegraph wires could be placed under it.
 I realize that I am witnessing a rare moment of purgation---
 accumulated frustration suddenly expressing itself in near-hysteria.
 I play along.  "I understand that under your system each enterprise
 makes its own plans and sends them to Gosplan for approval,  What
 goes wrong?"
 "Gosplan-those mother-rapers]" explodes Denyega.
 "Our cross and crown of thorns," says Girenko, rolling his eyes
 to the foggy sky.

 are often made by unqualified people at the top. Overall planning
 devitalizes the individual building organizations. Here your con-
 tractors do what common sense tells them.  We frequently can not.
 That is our grief.  It is not your factories and engineers that impress
 me," continues Denyega.  "Man for man, plant for plant, we are
 as good as you are.  But in system of management-here you have
 something we should take lessons in."
 "Ach, we know all this," Girenko says.  "We didn't have to come to
 America to see the changes that are needed.  Life demands them.
 Life teaches us.  It is just a question of time, we will make them.
 And then, mark my words, we will catch up with you."
 At this juncture the head of the delegation comes climbing up
 and slips on the same rung I did.  It does not improve his humor.
 "Well, have you found anything useful?" he asks Denyega and Girenko.
 "Not very much ..."
 "Then why waste time?"
 "Well, not utter waste.  Note here-they use stamped pipe clamps.
 We still cast them.  It is cheaper their way," says Denyega.
 "Aha, Ahal"  Shepetyev is pleased and tells the secretary, Kazari-
 nov, always at his elbow, to note the name and location of the
 factory that makes this minor item.  "Now please, Ivan Antonovich,
 do stay at my side," he turns to me.  "My colleagues need you.
 What were you discussing here so long?"
 "The delegates very kindly explained some facts about building
 planning that confused me."
 "Later, later, I will personally explain and answer all your ques-
 tions.  They are not specialists in this field and should not try to
 educate you.  I am the specialist.  I will talk to you later.  But
 right now please work with me.  Every minute is valuable.      This
 trip is very expensive and we are not rich like you.  Shall we go?"
 Some Notes and Thoughts
 At the airport I quickly make notes on the conversation, and then
 I test my recall from brief notes I took about a week ago on
 another incident involving Denyega.
 Approved For Release 2005/01/05 : Cl

 My notes, like those of most interpreters trained by the State
 Department, are based on the principle of Egyptian ideographs
 with a few key words, letters, or symbols added.  In the t\'inkling
 of an eye a whole idea or incident can thus be recorded.  This
 method releases the interpreter's attention for listening and compre-
 bending.  Of course it takes practice.  The principles of interpreting
 impressed on us in the instruction are the following:
 Learn to listen; subordinate yourself. Listen for the ideas, to what
 the man is selling, not what he is saying.  Interpret the man's ideas
 rather than his words whenever possible. Make your notes suggestive,
 to stimulate your memory.  These personal reminders will also be
 secure.
 Now I am pleased that I seem to recall fully the week-old incident
 from just a few ideographs and words and can compare it with
 what just happened at Paducah city hall.  Here is how it goes.
 The letter L and the symbols 3/12, yd. tell me that on 3 December
 1963 we were at the Lorain factory near Cleveland which makes
 cranes, and the incident took place in the yard.  A crudely drawn
 fish skeleton and the words Loch Ness, tubular, 250' welded remind
 me that we were looking at a tower of a crane 250 feet high made of
 welded tubular steel instead of the usual riveted flat members.  It
 therefore had unusual lightness and strength.   And it did look to
 me like the skeleton of a Loch Ness Monster.
 The letters D, K, 0, and the word Gosplan with a line through
 it mean that Denyega, Kazarinov, and an engineer named Ozerov
 who builds cranes assured me they knew of such crane construction
 and wanted to build some, but Gosplan objected.  Or, rather, it
 upheld the steel industry, which did not want to have to make a
 special small production run for the tubing.
 Uralmash=Henry Ford "T" tells how, when I asked the engineers
 why they could not place an order with say the famous Uralmash,
 they replied that this wealthy combine, with its own sanatoria and
 a huge director's fund from which special bonuses can be given its
 employees, is slow to change models and so makes a lot: of money
 but produces machinery they considered obsolete.  I thought of Henry
 Ford clinging to his Model T and making quite a few millions by
 not changing.
 The last symbol is a book with the letter K.   This is my observa-
 tion that Kazarinov, the secretary, who at home is a senior engineer
 at Gosstroy and tests all the foreign machinery for it (to compare it
 DP78T03194A000200030001-0

 with the Soviet, he says)-this Kazarinov, with a face like Shosta-
 kovich and as tall and lean as an Olympic track star, is a fabulous
 note-taker.  Looking over his shoulder I see that he too uses symbols
 and ideographs, and he is a marvelous sketcher.  When he cannot
 take pictures (as he does by the hundreds) or get photos or drawings
 from the plant, he takes notes in order to make sketches later.  "The
 design of this connector is so interesting," he confides with a happy
 smile.
 I bet he will have an almost 100-percent recall of every plant layout,
 dam site, and construction project we visited, as well as design
 features of new machinery.  But I note that the Americans shy away
 from telling him everything.  Usually they hold back about steel
 specifications.  Maybe this is one reason the Soviets still have to buy
 U.S. technical data and know-how.
 St. Louis
 Six months later, in the summer of 1964, I am in St. Louis with
 another delegation.  A high-powered one, it includes: Novikov, head
 of Gosstroy and deputy to Khrushchev in the Council of Ministers;
 Neporozhny, top man on electrification and builder of the Aswan
 Dann, just back from a visit to Egypt with Khrushchev; several Min-
 isters of Construction from large republics; Petya Chernyshev, builder
 of the largest turbines for electric generators and a recent Hero of
 the Soviet Union.  The last is a pudgy, nervous, pleasant young
 man who speaks in snatches.  His hands testify that he did indeed             i
 start his career as a lathe operator at the plant where he is now
 the principal engineer.
 I no sooner step into the hotel than I am told to call a number
 in Washington "no matter what the time is." I recognize the number
 as that of my backstop, Sean. I cannot make the call until 2:30 A.M.
 Reason: his most communistic majesty Ignaty Trofimovich Novikov
 chooses to have tantrums and summons me and the tour manager to
 his suite and bawls us out because no crowds, no VIP's, no press
 and photographers met him at the airport.  He had wanted to make
 a speech on Soviet-USA friendship there at eleven o'clock at night
 in a pouring rain.  We express anguish at his displeasure, promise
 to phone Washington, and hope to do better in the future.  Thanks
 to Neporozhny we are dismissed with a conciliatory pat on the back
 and a tumbler of Ukrainian vodka aptly called Gorilka, the Burner.
 Then I get Sean out of bed and get the news, which is good.

 cooperating fully in the effort to get answers to intelligence questions.
 A young engineer named Joe is the key man, and I should work
 with him.  I have seen the questions, and they are good.  They
 are clear, logical, and not probing sensitive matters about which a
 delegate cannot tactfully be asked.  Enough background is given
 for the questioner to understand the problem.  Petya (t:he Turbine)
 Chernyshev is the main target.
 The next morning finds me working without a break.  Since the
 tour began, ten days ago, I have not asked a single question; but
 I have bought technical books 2 and periodicals as gifts, have given
 Neporozhny a plastic raincoat, have made some useful suggestions
 from prior experience in some of the areas visited-in short, I have
 put the Soviets under obligation to me.  I have helped there and
 they know it.
 I spot Joe easily.  He is a smart young engineer, a turbine spe-
 cialist.  He and Petya enjoy talking to each other through me.  But
 there never is an opportunity for them really to get together. The
 next day is the same. The third day it rains, and I am getting des-
 perate.  Nonetheless a part of the group goes out to a power plant
 under construction, puts on rubber boots, and sloshes through the
 foot-deep mud at the site.
 As we start back Joe and I make our move.  Joe says he wants
 Petya to ride with us. Petya is most agreeable, for he has questions
 on the huge new turbine he has seen.  But the other Soviets raise
 a cry as if Petya is being kidnapped, and the Americans not in on
 the game side with them.  Shortly everybody is hopping in and out
 of cars-a Mack Sennet comedy in the mud.   I am getting dirty
 looks from everybody.  Petya ignores them and gets into the car
 next to Joe, who is at the wheel.  I get in and shut the door and
 we drive off.  The others follow, then overtake us as we slow down
 for conversation.
 Petya wants to know why the compressor is located where it is
 on the new turbine.  A tough question, but Petya sketches the tur-
 bine and Joe explains why.                                                                                                                      Petya understands, takes notes, and
 begins to look like the cat that swallowed the canary.  Then Joe
 asks him questions about his turbine and his problems with it.
 I suggest that he sketch it, pleading the very real difficulty of inter-
 preting technical descriptions.                                                                                                                    Petya does; and presto he shows its
 2 Soviets were particularly interested in the "critical path raei:hod" of pro-
 gramming construction.

 configuration, its size, the steam flow, and many other characteristics-
 everything we wanted to know.
 Joe takes the sketch while driving. He glances at it, points to
 the exhaust, and says, "Tell him, John, there's where his trouble is."
 Petya turns beet-colored and bursts out with something incompre-
 hensible, showering my face with saliva.  Then he chokes with
 laughter as he wipes my face with his hand in a friendly Soviet
 way--"Tell him that I have trouble here too," and he points to the
 last section where the blades are longest.  He says Joe is real bright
 and pats his shoulder.  Joe says Petya is real bright and pats him
 back.  He says both Westinghouse and General Electric had trouble
 in exactly these same spots when they were in the design stage.
 Petya asks about steels, and Joe tells him something but seems unable
 to recall the full answer.
 Suddenly Joe honks madly.  The lead car has forgotten to make a
 turn.  Joe makes the turn, and soon we are driving along the Missis-
 sippi without the other car.                 Joe asks if Petya would like a ride to
 see another plant with an interesting water intake.  Would he? Why
 it's the river of Mark Twain. He has read "Life on the Mississippi."
 So another hour of talk about turbines.  The two promise to write
 to each other; Joe will send Petya some steel specifications when he
 finds them.
 When we arrive at the hotel Novikov's personal secretary is stand-
 ing at the entrance, angry and impatient.               He demands what Petya
 was doing for such a long time.  Petya pats the pocket where his note-
 book is with a happy expression and says he was learning things
 about turbines and viewing the Mississippi.  "And how was it?" asks
 the secretary.  "Wet," says Petya, and walks away.
 Joe and I compare notes.  He reveals he was the one that made the
 wrong turn-on purpose.      He agrees to write a report for Washing-
 ton.  Petya is at least three-maybe four-years behind us, he says.
 But he is bright.  If he knew English he would recommend the Com-
 pany hire him.                  "He's no competition now, but he will be."
 Schenectady
 Although the people who work and live in Schenectady call it an
 ugly and dull company town, I found it a cool, immaculately kept
 little city, set in an emerald valley and having wide boulevards,
 magnificent factories, and a lovely old section of colonial homes
 with large neat lawns and flowering shrubs that have Georgetown
 -RD P78TO3140W20% 3s0001-0
 in D.C. beat all hollow.  Furthermore, Neporozhny, his secretary,
 and Petya (the Turbine) Chernyshev, who were there with me
 on the closing days of their tour, agreed with me wholeheartedly.
 When the tour of the factories was over we walked through this
 colonial section, and the Soviets daydreamed like kids, picking out
 which house they would like to live in.  They praised Schenectady
 and the American engineers and managers and labor and General
 Electric and the whole United States.  Schenectady and the Hudson
 river valley is just like countryside in the vicinity of Kiev, they said,
 admitting they were getting homesick.
 Maybe Schenectady looked so good because all of us were happy,
 the Soviets with what they had learned and I with the facts I had
 gathered.  For after St. Louis, and particularly after Los Angeles,
 mid-way in the tour-after I had taken care of Neporozhny when
 he fell ill and got him gratis a miracle-working doctor who had
 him back on his feet in one day-the tour became for me virtually
 a movable feast of facts and interpretations.  My main frustration
 was inability to absorb all of the particulars and details that were
 thrust upon me from all sides; it is my practice not to take notes
 during such conversations.  Consider the following:
 Item one.  The Minister of Construction from Kazakhstan, shaken
 by the colossal irrigation and flood-control works in southern Cali-
 fornia, began to tell me all about his irrigation scheme.  The Minister
 from the Ukraine said his was much bigger, and both started reeling
 off names and details concerning the crash program that seems to
 be under way in the USSR.  Neporozhny, with a mischievous twinkle
 in his eye, said the program was drawn up personally by his friend
 Nikita Khrushchev, who sequestered himself a whole month at his
 dacha after the disastrous crop failure, helped by only one expert.
 Item two.  Neporozhny revealed to a host (who I could tell had
 been well briefed intelligence-wise) his problem with costs in electric
 power production, how they seem to be twice the average in the
 United States, and how all the turbines in the world will not lower
 them significantly as long as Gosplan makes the electric industry
 use the worst coal in the RSFSR so it can give the best to the
 chemical and steel industries.  "Right now the chemists in the
 Soviet Union are Czar and God," he said.  "I am having to use my
 cadres on building twenty factories for them."
 Item three.  At the amazing Enrico Fermi atomic plant in Detroit,

 directly from burning gases, and again in Schenectady the Soviet
 electric power specialists made no secret of their philosophy for
 expansion of the industry, their troubles with a long-range trans-
 mission system which they had been boosting for sale to the United
 States, the high cost of atomic fuel in the Soviet Union, apparently
 precluding large-scale commercial use until a fast breeder reactor
 is perfected, and their troubles with bursting boilers, symptomatic
 of the general stand-still in electrical engineering until there is a
 breakthrough in metallurgy.  The American hosts agreed they had
 similar troubles; electricity knows no politics.  But everywhere in
 this area we seem to be ahead, sometimes by a nose and sometimes
 by several lengths.
 Item four.  On one long flight I opened a gambit by saying I had
 not yet met a delegation that liked Gosplan.  The delegates laugh-
 ingly agreed and told the following story:
 "We understand that the mythical figure Jesus Christ once worked
 an utterly improbable miracle; he fed the multitudes with five loaves
 and two fishes.  Well, it might have been possible after all.  He did
 not have the Gosplan allocating his material resources."
 Then, referring to speeches of Novikov, I asked his secretary if
 Novikov was satisfied that he could bring about with his existing
 authority and organization the programmed improvements in the
 construction industry.  "No," was the reply, "he has asked the
 Council of Ministers for some added powers, which Gosplan, headed
 by Lomako, now has."
 For the next several hours, five miles up in the sky, I was afforded
 insight into the workings of the minds of the top Soviet echelon as
 the various Ministers dropped in on this bull session.  They com-
 plained that insufficient funds are allocated for planning and super-
 vision.  "The difference between us and the Americans," said the
 six-foot-seven Minister from the Ukraine, "is that here they think
 before they start construction, and we afterwards."  Even Novikov
 joined the party to remark that Ministers should merely execute
 orders while others-more intelligent people-do the thinking for
 them.
 Last Flight
 Mulling all this over at the Schenectady airport, I decide I should
 make one more try, for the answer to a question a colleague has
 asked about Soviet organization.  So another gambit.  I give Nepo-
 Approved For Release 2005/01/05 : CIA
 SECRET
 -RDP78T0314R6N100('650001-0
 rozhny a handbook I have promised him-Annual Indicators of the
 USSR, published by the joint Economic Committee of Congress in
 February 1964.  It is my personal copy and shows the use.  Nepo-
 rozhny is grateful.  Since he can read some English he is at once
 so absorbed in it that I begin to regret giving it to him.
 "Aha, aba," he mutters.  "See how much bigger you are than we.
 What is all this devilishness Lomako has been telling mel  Wait till
 I shove this at him. Oh I will shove it hard."
 I ask if it is possible that a person of his rank has trouble getting
 original foreign statistical data.  Surely the Soviet embassy in Wash-
 ington would send him a copy.  Looking away, he says matter-of-
 factly, "Shameful as it is to admit, this is one of the hangovers from
 the Stalinist period we have not yet eliminated.  Our government
 organizations do not exchange information freely-lateral dissemina-
 tion of economic data is frowned upon.  There is a prejudice against
 asking for it unless it is directly related to your job; and occupying
 the position I do, I am supposed to set an example for others."
 Boarding the airplane, I ask to be seated next to Neporozhny.  He
 is still studying the handbook with shifting expressions of satisfac-
 tion and dissatisfaction.  I pull out of my briefcase a new, still
 uncatalogued Soviet book on organization of economic management
 and open it to a place my colleague had marked.  Here is indicated
 a new organization, and one of great importance, for it stands squarely
 between the Council of Ministers, which runs the economic life of
 the Soviet Union, and the four pillars of planning and management-
 Gosplan (Lomako), the Councils of National Economy ('.Dimshyts ),
 Gosstroy (Novikov), and the several specialized State Production
 Committees (headed by men like Neporozhny).  This new body is
 headed by Ustinov and called the USSR Supreme Council of National
 Economy.  Its function is not at all explained by the tiny paragraph
 devoted to it.
 I ask Neporozhny what this organization does and does he know
 Ustinov.  I tell him how hard it is for me to make intelligent transla-
 tions because of a lack of clarity in some Soviet publications, of which
 this is a good example.  His answer is simple; it is a kind of appeals
 board for conflicts which can be resolved on a technical basis without
 modification of basic directives.  The Council of Ministers did not
 want to be bothered with questions which experts could settle.
 I note that the new Council has specialists for defense on its staff
 and pry further-for it is suspected that it also coordinates economic

 activity with defense requirements.  What kind of experts does Usti-
 nov have?  Neporozhny says Utinov's staff is small but he calls in
 experts as needed.  What kind, I ask.
 The now familiar twinkle comes into Neporozhny's intense blue
 eyes.  "Preference is given to ex-wrestlers," he says.  "They grab
 the ministers by the scruff of the neck and seat of the pants, catch-
 as-catch-can fashion, and pull them off each other.                            For Ustinov
 is a small man and not very strong.  Against a man like Novikov,
 who is a former coal miner, he wouldn't have a chancel"
 Checkmate.  I know when I'm licked and put the book away.
 I make a few notes, openly this time.  Neporozhny continues to
 answer questions and talk freely on other problems of economic
 organization and management-industrial consolidation, capital for-
 mation, labor productivity, and its scarcity under the new priority
 for agriculture. When I ask how a central planning system can com-
 pensate for the lack of the built-in incentives to cut costs in a com-
 petitive system, he says, "Since you raise this question, you are the
 person best qualified to answer it.  Come to Moscow and we will
 give you all the information needed for a comparative study."
 "Do you think it would be useful?"
 "I think," says Neporozhny, "the more meaningful fact is the suita-
 bility of a system to a people at their present stage of development.
 At one time your system gave you very rapid growth.  Your mastery
 of technology is beyond what I imagined it to be; yet your growth
 has slowed down.  Clearly something is wrong if, having such fine
 cadres of labor and engineers, such abundance of resources, and
 such a God-sent climate, you are not working at your highest poten-
 tial. We are. Our growth is more rapid than yours.  So Communism
 is in our blood and there can be no hint of a return to the past."
 I explain that I was not thinking of that, but of the capacity of
 their system to evolve, as ours has also evolved. "Yes, we change,"
 he replies.  "So long as new ideas do not conflict with basic Marxism
 and dialectical materialism, we adapt them for our use.  Notice I
 say adapt; we do not copy.  Neither machinery nor ideas do we
 copy.  All require adaptation before being incorporated in our
 system."
 Neporozhny, who had been a professor of electrical engineering
 with many published works, says he became an industrialist when,
 under Khrushchev's reforms of 1957, a decision was made to have
 the economic life of the country run not by politicians but by top

 specialists.  I ask if Novikov is a PhD.  Again sparks fly from
 Neporozhny's eyes and he cannot resist a witticism.  "He is a political
 engineer," he says, leaving me to ponder the double meaning while
 his colleagues turn red.
 Net Evaluation
 The tour is over.  At the Kennedy airport, as the delegation
 prepares to emplane, Novikov gets off his last speech before a few
 Americans, including the official State Department host.  Compared
 with his initial speech a month ago, this shows him a changed man.
 He is more relaxed, far more thoughtful.  The strident, self-confident
 style of the udarnik, the shock worker, is mercifully gone. 1110 speaks
 of the usefulness of the tour, simply, with dignity and sincerity. He
 asks the Americans to come and visit the USSR, where they too may
 learn something.  His talk of peace and friendship does not sound
 like propaganda.  The dapper Ambassador Fcdorenko, delegate to
 the UN, trembling in the presence of Novikov, translates his speech.
 He falters and I have the satisfaction of prompting him.
 Later I shall see that Novikov gave a favorable and fair interview
 to Pravda on his return to Moscow.  The main nonintelligence objec-
 tive of the tour, its one really big purpose, has been accomplished:
 even a tough, doctrinaire Communist like Novikov has been deeply
 impressed by the United States.  And this is the usual pattern for
 every delegation I have accompanied.  At first impatience, bragga-
 docio, suspicion, and unreasonable demands.  Then the big thaw
 and a period of good feeling.   Then the thoughtful, quiet parting,
 the warmth of a month's comradeship dissipated as the Soviets make
 ready to be whisked back into their perilous, rigid world.
 What impressed them?  Not only, I hope, our industrial might,
 roads, cars, real wages.  I hope it is our people and their attitude
 towards life: the semi-employed workman speaking without embar-
 rassment to a Minister about his car, his mortgage, his union benefits,
 his sons in school or in the army; the lovely air hostess who quickly
 learns enough Russian to offer them ko f e ili chai; the soft-spoken
 colored porter who graciously refuses their tip; the earnest college
 students poring over books in the library.
 As for the intelligence objective, the interpreter is greatly aided if
 there is no break in the question chain that originates with the

 meeting winding up a plant visit.  To the Soviets it seems only
 fair that reasonable questions should be put to them by Americans
 engaged in the same line of work.  This then gives the interpreter
 an opening to follow up with more questions and develop the topic
 more fully.  It is quite difficult-sometimes, with a hostile delega-
 tion, utterly impossible-for an interpreter to start the questions on
 his own.
 Aside from factual information there is need for interpretive insight
 into what stands behind it.  The integral meaning of what lies
 openly before us is probably one of the more important problems in
 Soviet studies today, and the interpreter who lives for a month with
 a Soviet group is in a good position to achieve some insight into
 deeper meanings.

 THE ENIGMA OF SOVIET BW
 Wilton E. Lexow
 and
 Julian Hoptman
 Despite a considerable expenditure of time and resources, the
 pursuit of intelligence on biological warfare activities in the USSR
 has been unrewarding.   There is no firm evidence of the existence
 of an offensive Soviet BW program.  Some Soviet biomedical research
 transcends normal public health requirements, and from time to
 time top Soviet military officials have boasted publicly that they
 have the means to rebuff a U.S. attack with nuclear, chemical, or
 biological weapons.  We know that the Soviet military establish-
 ment is concerned over U.S. BW research, and we have some insight
 into their organization and activities for medical defense agaiinst
 BW attack.  But we still do not know their precise defense readiness
 posture or their specific logistical preparations.
 The paucity of real evidence has forced us to resort to indirect
 signs. Attempts have been made to examine all military-related
 activity in the fields of biology and medicine, all technical publications
 which appeared to be censored by security considerations, and all
 biomedical studies which did not jibe with Soviet public health
 requirements as we know them.  Analysts have used speculation,
 analogy, and parallels with other nations' BW research, development,
 and practice in recent times and in the historical past.  They have
 analyzed Soviet, Satellite, and Chinese propaganda charges of U.S.
 germ warfare for clues as to the Communists' sophistication and
 familiarity with BW hardware and agents.
 The Grim Presumption
 The accepted premise had been that the heavy U.S. BW commit-
 ment which has been public knowledge, along with the Japanese
 World War II effort as known to the Soviets, would probably have
 engendered a comparable program in the USSR.  Postwar defector

 reports and German intelligence findings implicated several persons
 and locations in such a Soviet program.  It was with this premise in
 mind that available sources, primarily the open literature, had been
 closely screened for indications such as those cited above.  But it
 seemed that good Soviet security, censorship, and care not to mar
 the image of their well-advertised adherence to the Geneva Con-
 vention had eliminated from the scientific literature all trace except
 of defensive preparations and attitudes.  The same was true of writ-
 ings on military doctrine.  Sensitization of expert travelers to the
 problem and the evaluation of such evidence as there was by the
 most knowledgeable sources in the United States brought no new
 insights.  Then suddenly new photographic and other intelligence
 seemed for a time to confirm our worst suspicions with hard evidence
 of elaborate BW test range activities.
 The foremost suspect as a biological warfare center had long been
 Vozrozhdeniya Island in the Aral Sea.  The finger was first put
 on this island in 1951 by the "Hirsch Report."  Hirsch, who had
 been a German intelligence officer during the war, compiled his
 report on Soviet BW and chemical warfare activities from data in
 German intelligence files.  The bulk of its great volume was devoted
 to CW, and since much of this agreed with other information avail-
 able to U.S. intelligence, the entire report gained some credence.
 Hirsch declared that the Soviets had been engaged in BW research
 in the early 1930's, carrying out experiments in a Moscow laboratory
 and on Gorodomlya Island in Lake Seliger northwest of Moscow.
 BW field trials were at first held at the CW proving ground at
 Shikhany near the city of Volsk.  But the proximity of this proving
 ground to the city limits made it too hazardous for BW, and they
 were shifted in 1936 to Vozrozhdeniya Island and reportedly again
 in 1937.
 The island is well suited to BW experimentation.  It is located
 quite a distance from the nearest shore of the Aral Sea, which
 itself lies in an arid, barren, and sparsely settled region of the
 USSR.  Animal ecology difficulties which would plague a mainland
 facility are virtually nonexistent; only a transient bird population
 presents a problem in containing the spread of experimental diseases.
 Security against observation and accidental or intentional intrusion
 by unauthorized persons is at a maximum.  The climate is suitable
 for testing the influence of a variety of environmental conditions.

 Trials could be carried out over water, as the British had demon-
 strated during their offshore BW trials at Bermuda.  The site offers
 few of the restrictions which the U.S. mainland facility has had to
 overcome.
 Target Analysis
 With this first clue to an intelligence target, BW analysts in the
 community embarked upon an intensive search of Soviet literature
 dealing with the Aral Sea region.  Requirements were :levied upon
 all collectors, and a comprehensive survey was made of all the
 economic and scientific aspects of the area.  In support of collection
 and analysis, surveys were made of fishing, transportation, geography,
 scientific expeditions, hydrochemistry, marine biology, geology, and
 climate and weather in the area.   It is probably safe to say that
 some of the analysts came to know this region and its problems
 better than the inhabitants.
 Despite all this area research, little was found specifically about
 Vozrozhdeniya Island.  It had been surveyed by a scientific expedi-
 tion in the early 1900's; there was a prison camp there in 1926.
 A small fishing village, uninhabited during the winter inonths, appar-
 ently existed on the island in the 1920's and 1930's.  But the paucity
 of information about this island could not be an indicator of anything
 particularly sinister, for there was very little known about any of the
 many islands in the Sea, including the largest one, Barsa-Kelmes.
 Other sources than literature yielded little information.  Two clan-
 destine reports noted physical security measures to prohibit access
 to the island but revealed nothing of the nature of any facility on it.
 Then in 1957 high-level photography brought the first big wind-
 .fall.  Photographs of the island revealed the rather extensive .installa-
 tions shown on the model pictured on page 18.  There were more
 than 150 buildings of various sizes grouped into two settlements
 about 21/2 miles apart.  The northern and largest group of buildings
 appeared to be the administration, housing, and logistics area, marked
 "operational headquarters" on the model.  Its barrack-like buildings
 were large enough to accommodate about 1,400 people.  The south-
 ern group was contained within a high walled area which appeared
 to be the work or "laboratory" site.  South from the "laboratory" area
 tangled roads and tracks led to five centers, called "test sites" on
 the model.  At each of these centers was a tower and one or two

 Th, fact that Vozrozhdeniya Island had been carried for years
 as a ;aspect BW site so oriented the thinking of PI analysts,  hat a
 BW b.uu,tion was immediately hypothesized.  Many of the frararneters
 of it i\V research and test area do fit the picture of ill( island, but
 it wa ; `soon realized that a few do not, some of them too critical
 to be discounted.  The whole range of other possible functions was
 therefore examined with all the background information on the area
 in mind.  CW research or testing, a guided missile or clrctronic
 installation, fishing and fish processing, geological exploration, a
 prison:, a secret police training establishment, and it i ra nilitary
 training area were considered and discarded.   The enly certain
 finding was that the general layout of the buildings, parade r mind,
 and other features distinguished it as a military rather timan cit'iliau
 establishment.
 The island was photographed a second time in 1959.  Although
 there wire changes such as additional building, there were nn new
 clues  to  its function.  Three major obstacles remained before it
 could Is' classified as a BW installation.  First, the apparent grid
 systems, needed for measuring dispersion of test agents, were small,
 ill-defined as to configuration and purpose, and not con rparalrle. to
 those it the Soviet CW proving ground and U.S. 13W-CW proving
 grounds.  Second, there were no indications of the ne,cessarv air
 support for BW test activities.  For example there was no evidence of
 a sophisticated landing strip, decontamination facilities; for aircraft,
 or night landing facilities.  Third, the buildings and presarnccl in-
 habitants of Konstantin Island just to the south were in the lath of
 the prevailing winds, precluding tests with live 13W agents.
 Since 1959 renewed efforts on an all-source basis have trirncd rip
 no otis r indications of the nature of the activity on the islaurl   In
 recent years the Soviets have published a considerable amount of
 material on the Aral area and its economic problems, esp,,cially
 the fishing industry.  In this connection they have occasionally
 mentioned some of the smaller islands.  The largest island,      3arsa-
 Kelmes has been given some publicity in the Soviet and British Irress
 as a unique game preserve.  But about Vozrozhdeniya fsfind the
 enigmatic silence holds.

 Despite tight security, a highly developed Soviet BW weapons
 system and technology should have surfaced sometime during the
 years since the war, just as the nuclear and chemical warfare efforts
 have.  Current analyses, therefore, while clearly stating our lack
 of positive knowledge, depart radically from the old assumptions
 and look at Soviet military doctrine realistically in terms of limited
 BW activity and the unsure potential of BW weapons.
 This reappraisal has not lessened the need for an alert analytical
 thrust into Soviet capabilities and intentions with respect to BW
 weaponry.  Rather, it points the way for greater emphasis on the
 possibility of Soviet covert action with such weapons in the light
 of U.S. vulnerability to clandestine attack.  It calls for more intensive
 scrutiny of available R&D benchmarks for BW activity and of
 medical defense applications that could also be used for offensive
 purposes.  Intelligence on the biomedical aspects of unconventional
 warfare in the USSR will also continue to contribute to other related
 fields-biological contamination of aircraft and spacecraft, bioastro-
 nautics applications of BW-related technology, estimates of Soviet
 vulnerability to BW attack and the socio-economic consequences.
 Retrenchment and reorientation are thus helping us make the best
 of our few resources.  Nonetheless, the BW intelligence effort needs
 new overt collection methods and more emphasis on covert penetra-
 tion in order to improve the low-quality information now available
 from reliance on collective experience and sensitivity to indicators.

 DEATH OF AN HYPOTHESIS
 Sherman Kent
 One of the obvious rules of our calling-and one not: always
 observed-is not to do things the hard way when an easier way
 will suffice.
 Some of us vividly remember the occasion when General Smith
 at the head of the IAC table referring to the National Intelligence
 Estimate under consideration asked how in the world it came to be
 there.  Its subject was the UK.  With something more than his
 usual asperity, and be it said, some disingenuousness, he fairly spat
 at one of his lieutenants, "If I want to know what the British are
 up to, I call them up and ask."
 Perhaps more to the point is a story of a student who was taking
 Dr. Siegerist's course in the history of medicine at Hopkins.  Some-
 one had sent in a peculiar object and wanted to know what could be
 made of it.  It was sculpted stone; its subject was clearly anatomical
 (some sort of organ from some sort of animal; and it was embellished
 with a good amount of cuneiform script).  Dr. Siegerist gave it to
 the class as a problem in identification.  One student took it to the
 professor of ancient oriental languages who read the inscription and
 said it was gibberish.  He rendered a few passages out loud to
 prove it.
 Another student looked long at the stone and decided it resembled
 no human organ.  Thus skipping over his professor of gross anatomy
 he took it to a butcher.  The butcher instantly and unequivocally
 identified it as a liver, in fact a sheep's liver.  When the professor of
 ancient oriental languages heard this, his thinking changed gears and
 an unexpected kind of sense began to emerge from the cuneiform
 gibberish.  Suddenly he recognized some of the formularies of a spell
 or a charm or an utterance of divination.  The hero to ]Dr. Siegerist
 was, however, not the professor; it was student number two who had
 made the essential contribution and had done it the easy way.
 What follows is another piece of the same-but something by
 far closer to our professional calling.  It is recounted here not only

 to praise the methodology of student number two, but also to make
 the point that the destruction of an interesting hypothesis is often as
 important a part of our trade as its confirmation.
 Old Art for Cash
 One morning while shaving, Intelligence Officer Jones had a bright
 thought-or so it seemed.  If he could prove it out perhaps it would
 help explain how the Chinese Communists were getting some of the
 hard currency for sorely needed imports-foodstuffs, for example.
 Suppose, Jones thought, the Chinese, recognizing the great cash value
 of their national art treasures, decided to sell them.  Why shouldn't
 they?  Why should the Communist leadership sentimentally rate these
 relics of classical society and the rotten old empires as "treasures"?
 So long as rotten young Western capitalism did so rate them, why
 not realize the seemingly large amount of foreign exchange their cold-
 blooded sale would produce?  Why not?
 Jones speedily took his hypothesis to his professional colleagues.
 None of them knew much more about oriental art and its market
 than he.  They too may have thought they recalled stories of Park-
 Bernet auctions where some bit of Tang or Ming sold for a very
 large sum.  They did not, however, jump aboard Jones' hypothesis
 with his sort of enthusiasm.  They confined themselves to a lukewarm
 comment that only served to spur Jones on.
 Still doing it the easy way, he took the hypothesis to a higher level
 of expertise: to an orientalist who had engineered San Francisco's
 acquisition of the Brundage collection, who in turn took it to her
 colleagues and dealer friends.  Her reports showed a lot of interest
 in the proposition, but produced no evidence to confirm.  Indeed
 what did come through was strictly negative.
 Jones began to feel that he had given the hypothesis all the play
 it deserved and was about to let it die when two things occurred
 to revive it.  The first was when Jones was informed that Newsweek
 sometime back had published an article to the effect that a Swedish
 dealer had purchased some treasures in Communist China and had
 exported them under license of the Chinese government.  The objects
 in question were on their way to an oriental collection in Stockholm.
 The second was when Jones heard from an impeccable witness that
 a good many old and extremely costly Chinese rugs were appearing
 on the Hong Kong market.  Surely these could not be considered

 as representing national treasures but they might be the indication
 of something that was.
 Missed Magnitude
 Jones decided to revive the enquiry.  This time he would go to
 the real experts.  He drafted a letter that went like this:
 Dear
 The other day some of us were talking about the growing tension between
 the Russians and the Chinese.  One of my friends, who is particularly well
 informed in such matters, spoke of the new and dramatic turn. for the worse
 in their relationship, and wondered in passing how the Chinese would be
 able to continue their very substantial purchases of foodstuffs and other
 raw materials in the world market if they can no longer count on the Russians
 and the European Satellites for financial help.  Another member of the
 group suggested that if the Chinese Communist government finds itself
 really pressed for hard currency, it might turn to selling its national art
 treasures.  It seems likely that if they should reach this point, they would
 probably do everything possible to conceal the matter.  In that case, the
 only way we could find out would be through chance communications
 between museum personnel and others who work in the field of oriental
 art around the world.
 With this piece of prose in hand he invited the curator of a famous
 oriental collection to lunch, gave him the necessary background, and
 made a cold pitch.  What did the curator think of the idea?  Would
 he be willing to send a letter like the above to his knowledgeable
 colleagues and show Jones what he got in reply?
 To Jones' delight the curator was enthusiastic.  Not that he gave
 a whoop for Jones' hypothesis, but for a totally different reason he
 was happy to go along. It was as the curator was explaining his own
 interest that he casually dropped an oblique half sentence that killed
 the hypothesis for Jones' purposes stone dead.  The death. blow was
 the curator's aside to the effect that the yearly sum spent world-
 wide for Chinese art was of the order of a million dollars.  With this
 amount of hard currency the Chinese would have less than one per-
 cent of their annual outlays for imported foodstuffs.
 Anti-Customs Consensus
 What had caught the curator's interest was an excuse to poll the
 experts in his field of expertise.  It seemed that the U.S. law for-
 bidding the import of all goods of Red Chinese origin was a major
 headache to U.S. art collectors and U.S. and foreign dealers.  Here is
 the reason: suppppose Mayuyama and Company of Tokyo acquired a.

 Chinese antique from a Japanese family that had owned it for a
 century.  Suppose the American curator wanted to buy it for his
 museum.   Before he could get the object into the United States he
 and Mayuyama would have to satisfy the U.S. customs people that
 the transaction would in no sense profit the Chinese Communists.
 The Japanese dealer would have to be able to prove that the object
 in question had left the Chinese mainland and had been paid for
 prior to the Communist takeover of 1949.  Jones got the idea that our
 customs people were pretty hard to satisfy.  Their attitude was under-
 standably irksome to American collectors, not to say foreign dealers
 who were not getting the full good out of the affluent American
 market.
 If the curator could get full and expert testimony to the effect that
 the Chinese were not willing to sell their art treasures and had not
 done so, then, he reasoned, he might have less trouble with U.S.
 customs.  Accordingly, he snatched at Jones' idea and Jones' draft
 letter; he added a paragraph of his own and sent it to some thirty
 colleagues.  They were fellow curators of the world's most important
 museums of oriental art and the world's most important dealers.
 If the hypothesis was not already dead as far as the curator was
 concerned, it speedily became so.  All but one or two of the people
 queried answered.  Most of them wrote after they had talked the
 matter over with other experts in the field.  The twenty-eight replies
 that did come in represented the view of several score, and every
 single one responded with a shattering negative.  A few did not
 confine themselves to saying they knew of no sales from the main-
 land, but quite gratuitously went on to indicate that they could not
 imagine the situation in which the Chinese regime would part with
 any of its treasures.  Two indicated that they had had unsubstantiated
 reports that the Chinese were actually spending good hard cash to
 repatriate certain objects of art.
 And what of the objects which Newsweek had reported on the way
 to Stockholm?  One of the respondents had seen them and called
 them "rubbish"; another, "junk."

 Some anti-revolutionary opera-

 political police.
 THE OKHRANA'S FEMALE AGENTS'
 Rita T. Kronenbitter
 Part I: Russian Women
 In a memorandum of 31 January 1911 addressed to the: Police
 Department in Petersburg, the imperial MVD gave a description. of
 Anna Gregoriyeva Serebryakova, the ideal of female agents:
 "She had completed 25 years of continuous and very useful service
 for Moscow Okhrana.  As a secret [penetration] agent she had. con-
 nections with the leaders of many subversive organizations but was
 not attached anywhere as a regular or active member.  Her motiva-
 tion for hard agent work came from her strong personal convictions.
 She hated sedition in all forms and performed her assignments against
 subversives as an idealist, having little interest in monetary remunera-
 tion . . .
 "She kept her secrets even from her family.     Accepting the job
 of clandestine employment against the revolutionaries, she had to
 reconcile herself to exposing her own children to revolutionary propa-
 ganda by holding meetings of subversives in her home . . .  Despite
 the emotional and spiritual conflicts she had to suppress unshared
 with anyone, her devotion to duty never failed."
 The memorandum goes on to declare that Serebryakova, now ill,
 blind, and deserted by her family after Burtzev, chief of the revolu-
 tionaries' counterintelligence, exposed her in 1909 as an Okhrana
 agent, was to receive an annual pension of 1200 rubles in gratitude
 for her long and devoted service.
 Personnel Practices
 The Okhrana depended heavily on female agents, particularly in
 foreign operations, and Serebryakova came to be held up and #re-

 quently pointed to as a model.  The best of the female operatives,
 the records show, did have their paramount motivation in patriotism
 and devotion to the anti-revolutionary cause.  But as in any intelli-
 gence service some were attracted by the danger and glamor of
 clandestine life, some were blackmailed into intelligence work, and
 many, especially those that were not Russian, had strictly mercenary
 motives.  Later we shall trace some individual agent careers of all
 these kinds.
 The records show that a number of Russian deep-cover agents
 were drawn into the service by some form of conversion after con-
 viction as revolutionaries.  Kovalskaya, "Gramm" (true name not
 recorded), Borovskaya, and Romanova are some of the ex-revolu-
 tionary women on the agent lists.  After having served part of their
 terms in prisons or in exile, they were persuaded to work for the
 Okhrana, freed on some legal pretext, and normally helped to escape
 abroad to begin their agent activity.  Although some of these con-
 verts in time became proficient and trusted employees, they were
 seldom accorded the same confidence as agents without prior leftist
 records.
 Wives, mistresses, and sisters of male Okhrana agents were often a
 convenient source of recruits, particularly for operations abroad.
 When director Lopukhin sent Lev Beitner to Paris in 1905 with the
 assignment of collecting the intelligence required to control arms
 smuggling on the part of the revolutionaries, the agent took with
 him his wife and sister in order to engage in simultaneous operations
 in the capitals and ports of France, England, and the Low Countries.
 The three received their pay separately, but Beitner did the planning
 and gave the women their assignments.  The operation was successful
 in uncovering every major shipment of arms in the Baltic and
 Black Seas.
 "Julietta," Beitner's sister, in addition to her immense contribution
 in spotting clandestine arms sales, supply dumps, and cargo craft and
 crews, distinguished herself later by discovering and infiltrating the
 shop where Robert Loewenthal, an emigre from Russia, counterfeited
 Russian banknotes to finance the revolutionaries.   She became
 Loewenthal's partner in the shop by giving 1000 francs, ostensibly
 from her savings but supplied by the Okhrana, for the purchase of
 some special printing equipment.  She met daily with her case officer
 for the operation, an Okhrana staff agent, and they worked out a
 Okhrana Women I                           CONFIDENTIAL
 detailed plan whereby the entire ring of producers and distributors
 could be taken red-handed.
 Agent Brontman's mistress Eropkina played a similar role. Like
 Beitner, Brontman had served many successful years in Russia. When
 the Okhrana decided to send him abroad, it hired his mistress and
 sent her along with him.  The two worked for a number of years as
 penetration agents, he in the Party of Socialist Revolutionaries, she
 with the Social Democrats (Bolsheviks).
 It appears that the salaries of women agents were for the most
 part equal to those of men, and frequently they were even higher.
 Their code names and pseudonyms were usually male (while male
 agents were at times given female first names or nicknames-- Katia,
 Lucy, Belle, and the like).
 Okhrana staff officers were always men.  Staff agents abroad, who
 did spotting, recruiting, and liaison work, controlled operations, and
 handled agents, were likewise always men.  The archives of the
 Okhrana abroad have no record of a woman in the capacity of case
 officer.  Women could be the most valuable of agents, engaged in
 extremely dangerous or sensitive operations, but they never held
 positions entailing any kind of supervisory function.  The Okhrrana
 offices at home likewise had no females on the staff except in clerical
 capacities; women served otherwise as agents only.
 In this respect the Okhrana's practice contrasts sharply with that
 in revolutionary ranks.  Lenin's wife Krupskaya, as the heavy Okhrana
 folders of her intercepted mail indicate, could be considered the de
 facto intelligence director for the Social Democratic Party (Bolshevik)
 and, in part, the Jewish Bundists.  Much of her correspondence with
 fellow conspirators all over Europe and the Russian Empire was in
 secret writing; this was of many types and often complex,  For years
 she was busy gathering information for the party and the revolution,
 sending out instructions, designing codes for communications, receiv-
 ing and dispatching couriers, and acting as an informal but competent
 intelligence center.
 The Okhrana's women were different from their counterparts among
 the revolutionaries in various other ways.  They were predominantly
 Christian, i.e., Greek Orthodox when of Russian origin, while the
 revolutionary women, like most of the men, either were Jewish or
 belonged to some minority group of the Empire such as the Poles,

 Armenians, or Latvians.2  The only Jewish female agents sent abroad
 by the Okhrana seem to be those who accompanied their male
 partners to form operational teams like those of Beitner and Brontman
 mentioned above.  But the Okhrana's male deep-cover agents abroad
 tended to be predominantly Jewish like the revolutionaries.
 The files contain no record of any special training for the women
 sent abroad.  All the outstanding ones, however, are shown to have
 spent some preparatory time in close association with the very top
 operators in Petersburg and Moscow.  That time was presumably de-
 voted to some kind of training, at least briefing on targets and methods
 of operation abroad.  There is no indication of any other than strictly
 operational relationship between the bosses in Russia and the female
 agents.  Abroad, the propaganda of the revolutionaries accused ex-
 posed female agents of being prostitutes or mistresses of their case
 officers, but the records give no reason to believe that the accusations
 were anything but convenient propaganda.
 Some of the women agents were instructed to communicate directly,
 upon arrival in the field, with the chiefs at headquarters in Petersburg
 or at Moscow Okhrana; accommodation addresses were supplied at
 both ends.  In all cases, however, it soon became the practice to
 channel communications through the field office in Paris or Berlin.
 The field offices then ultimately assigned case officers and exercised
 direct control over the agents.
 Following are case histories of some of the individual Okhrana
 women, selected as typifying the operations and methods of the time.
 First come the stories of three Russian agents, then those of some
 indigenous recruits.3

 to go into hiding from the police, and she had not been heard: from
 again.  The doctor, being a good and law-abiding citizen, had never
 approved of her revolutionary associations during their five years
 of married life together, and for that reason her disappearance had
 not unduly upset him.  Now he had decided that fifteen years was
 long enough to wait; he wanted to know whether she was dead or
 alive. In fact, he wanted to remarry.
 As was usual with such inquiries, this found its way to the Okhrana
 identity section in Moscow.  Zinaida's name was there, but the card
 contained only a reference to another set of identity records kept at
 Okhrana headquarters.  In Petersburg Zinaida's card and voluminous
 operational dossier were located under the name "Francesco."
 Matters under this operational code name were of utmost impor-
 tance and sensitive enough to require the personal attention of the
 chief.  Police Director Aleksei Vassiliyev wrote to Paris, instructing
 Paris Okhrana chief Krassilnikov to have a talk with agent Francesco,
 Mrne. Zhuchenko.  The Okhrana chiefs were just as anxious as the
 parties concerned to avoid a divorce suit in the open courts.  The lady
 turned out to be agreeable to a quiet divorce.  She asked that the
 doctor be told she was no longer in hiding but in Paris and still active
 as a revolutionary. He should be given her Paris address in order
 to simplify negotiation on the divorce.'
 Paris Okhrana files contain many references to Francesco, but the
 bulk of her operational dossier was probably removed to Petersburg
 after she was exposed by revolutionary intelligence and denounced
 as an Okhrana agent.  It is possible also that a revolutionary com-
 mission which came to Paris in 1917 to search the Okhrana records
 removed some of the papers on her.  This account of her career
 is therefore sketchy and drawn in part from general histories of the
 Okhrana.  All early writers about the service devote considerable
 space to her position among the revolutionaries and her accomplish-
 ments against them.
 Apprenticeship
 Zinaida, daughter of a government official named Guerngross and
 graduate of the Smolny Institute in Petersburg, was still a student at
 Moscow University when she made three vows, all at about the same
 time.  She took the marriage vow with young Doctor Zhuchenko;

 she took oath with a group of university students conspiring to kill
 the Czar; and she swore to serve faithfully as an Okhrana agent.
 From the beginning, her career shows that she took only the last of
 these seriously.  Even during her five years of married life she could
 not settle down to relatively prosperous ease as a housewife; to her
 husbands distress she associated with revolutionaries and malcontents
 of all brands.
 Her refusal to single out any one subversive group and become a
 member may have been due to her husband's protest, but it was more
 likely in conformity with the Okhrana's doctrine that the most de-
 pendable agent is one who succeeds in developing access to all revolu-
 tionary groups without belonging to any.2  In her later operations, as
 she forged the reputation of being one of the two most important of
 all Okhrana agents at home and abroad,3 she adhered strictly to this
 doctrine.  The other of the two, Evno Azev, contrastingly, forever
 strove to attain top positions among the revolutionaries, frequently by
 means of betraying his rivals to the Okhrana.
 Zinaida, according to a case officer's description of her as a student
 at the fashionable Smolny Institute, was thoroughly opposed to revolu-
 tionary activities but had a love for adventure and challenging risks.
 Even at: this time, before her recruitment, she expressed her convic-
 tion that the revolutionaries had a corrupting and demoralizing effect
 upon students and the people in general.  An eager recruit, she fol-
 lowed instructions with enthusiasm and was perspicacious and adven-
 turous enough to penetrate subversive groups and bands of con-
 spirators beyond her assigned targets.  Her case officers 4 first re-
 quired reports on individuals, groups, activities, and plans.  Much
 of her year or so under her Moscow case officer, Zubatov, must have
 been devoted to training and some to a cooling-off period.  But by
 1895 she had already attained the distinction, though probably known
 then only to Zubatov, of having saved the life of Czar Nicolas II.
 In the spring of that year Moscow students worked out a plan
 to kill tEhe Czar.  One of them was assigned to throw a bomb from a
 steeple of the Church of Ivan the Terrible down on the imperial

 cortege as it passed below.  The chemists in the conspiracy fashioned
 the device and it was delivered to a nearby monastery.  Zinaida
 waited until the preparations were finished and the conspirators were
 all in place, and then gave the word.  All were arrested, including
 Zinaida, and deported to Siberia.  There it was arranged that she,
 along with several others as a screen, could make good an escape.
 Trial by Terror
 Zinaida thus went abroad as an escaped Siberian exile and began
 operations under Arkadi Harting, chief of the Okhrana's Berlin out-
 post, who assigned her tasks in Berlin and Leipzig.  She was soon
 called to other European countries, but her principal target became
 the Socialist Revolutionaries and their Fighting Unit (Boyevaya dru-
 zhina) which carried out assassinations and other kinds of terror in
 Russia.
 Paralleling Zubatov in Moscow, Harting was the counter-intelligence
 planner par excellence abroad.  His successes as a provocation agent
 in Paris in 1890 had launched him on an intelligence career that took
 him to the very top of the Okhrana ladder.  In Berlin he relied
 heavily upon Zinaida's work, not only as her case officer but as chief
 of operations in Germany.  The two worked together as the most
 successful team of the period.  When Harting left Berlin to take
 charge of the integrated Okhrana station in Paris, Francesco, to use
 her code name, remained in Heidelberg with instructions to concen-
 trate on the Socialist Revolutionaries through active participation in
 their Fighting Unit for purposes of control.
 Active participation soon meant trouble for Francesco.  The rev-
 olutionaries had reason to suspect treachery in their ranks: too many
 conspirators sent to Russia to commit atrocities were being appre-
 hended.  Francesco was among those who had knowledge of all of
 these, and the central committee of the party may have had other
 grounds for suspecting her in particular.  Now the customary means
 of testing the loyalty of a member under suspicion was to assign acts
 of terror to him.  Francesco was accordingly, in 1905, made leader
 of one of three assassination teams to be dispatched simultaneously
 to Russia.  She personally was to carry out her team's assignment,
 the assassination of General Kurlov, governor of Minsk.
 This assignment posed a veritable dilemma before the Okhrana.
 If it wanted Francesco to remain in the Fighting Unit and continue
 her good work, she would have to carry out the assassination.  A

 solution was worked out by Colonel Klimovich of Moscow Okhrana.
 Francesco consented to carry out the assassination as instructed.  She
 met with her team of assistants and planned the details of the ac-
 tion-how, when, and where she would throw the bomb.  But from
 her lodgings she took the bomb to an Okhrana safe house, where
 an expert disarmed the detonator and made it a dud.  When it was
 thrown at General Kurlov nothing happened.
 In the meantime the other two teams had been successful in their
 assassinations.  Mme. Zhuchenko, Francesco, had given ample warn-
 ings of them, but there had been a slip-up somewhere in Colonel
 Klimovich's plans to prevent them.  In the course of investigating
 these acts of terror, Kurlov turned up the name Zhuchenko, and his
 pursuit of this lead was eventually to cause the exposure of her agent
 work.  Not knowing that she had actually saved his life, the governor
 made so much fuss about her that her true status had to be made
 known to certain Okhrana personnel that did not otherwise need
 to know.  Among these was a Leonid Menshchikov, who in 1910
 defected to the revolutionary intelligence service and betrayed her.
 Successful and Sought After
 Before that eventuality, however, Francesco had five more years of
 continuous, prolific service.  Now the conspirators fully trusted her,
 after she had personally participated in the triple assassination, two-
 thirds successful; they could not hold her responsible that her bomb
 turned out to be a dud.        Terrorist groups were liquidated by the
 authorities one after another, thanks in considerable measure to her
 reports and forewarnings.      Large-scale bank and other robberies,
 euphemistically called "expropriations" by the revolutionaries, failed
 after her alert.
 These extraordinary achievements gained Francesco a name as
 Okhrana's ace agent at home and abroad.  The top leaders at head-
 quarters, in Moscow, and in Paris, the only ones supposed to know
 her identity, vied for her services.  A set of cables and letters in a
 folder labeled Mikheyev-this was her pseudonym for interoffice
 correspondence-shows a tug-of-war for her between Harting in
 Paris and Colonel Klimovich in Moscow.   Klimovich's demands for
 her transfer finally ceased after Harting sent the following cable.

 By 1906 Mme. Zhuchenko's monthly pay had been raised to 500
 rubles, ample to let her move about as a fairly well-to-do lady.  In
 addition there were liberal presents for Christmas and Easter; bonuses
 for major exposures of assassination and burglary projects, and allow-
 ances for travel and other operational expense.  She had a son, her
 only personal responsibility, whom she kept in Berlin even when on
 prolonged assignments in Moscow.  Her home was in Berlin's western
 suburb of Charlottenburg.
 That is where she was when exposed by the defector Menshchikov.
 Burtzev, chief of counterintelligence for the revolutionaries, solemnly
 called on her.  He explained in his methodical and unexcited way
 that his intelligence penetration of the Okhrana made it completely
 clear to him that she was an Okhrana agent, that the central com-
 mittee had already sentenced her to death, and that he would per-
 sonally guarantee her life if she would come clean, confess, and
 thenceforth help him in the fight against the Okhrana.  She refused,
 and reported promptly to her case officer, Colonel von Kotten.
 Soon all the revolutionary press published her name as one of the
 most vicious agents-provocateurs ever exposed.  The Berlin police
 provided the necessary protection for her, but she had to be pensioned
 off-at pay higher than her active wages had been.  Resigned to her
 retirement, she said to Von Kotten, "In this profession no one can be
 safe from traitors and betrayals.  The fall of my life has come after
 rich and active labors in the spring and summer."  But Zavarz;in,
 Vassiliyev, and other authors have written that she still continued to
 make useful reports on the revolutionaries.  None of them knew what
 finally became of her.
 In 1910 she was about 45 years old but looked younger.  Zavarzin
 described her then as a tall, slender blonde, wearing glasses with
 round gold frames on a small nose under her large forehead, in short
 not particularly attractive and far from beautiful.  But her speech,
 he said, was most pleasant, firm, and precise, usually serious and
 giving an impression of extraordinary character and intelligence.

 Reminiscing about the long line of conspiracies broken up by her
 reporting, her eyes were animated as she described subterfuges she
 had used to escape from difficult situations.
 She knew that reforms were needed in Russia but was convinced
 that a better life could not be achieved through the Communists'
 proletarian revolution or the Socialist Revolutionaries' terror and
 agrarian revolt.  For herself she had only one real aim in life, to
 bring up her son properly.  Music was her main recreation, and she
 attended the opera frequently.  Knowing society well and feeling
 at home among all classes of people, from monarchists and aristocrats
 to underground subversives of all colors and morals, she was well
 equipped for her dedicated work.
 Ulyanova
 The Okhrana had recruited Roman Vatslavovich Malinovski, a
 Communist and personal friend of Lenin, in March 1910.  Within
 a few months it selected him for all-out clandestine support as candi-
 date for the Imperial Duma.               He was active in the Metal Workers
 Union and a good orator.  Some behind-the-scenes campaigning, the
 obedient good will of the gendarmes, and a supply of money from
 the Okhrana overcame all handicaps, even his prohibitive court record
 of having been jailed for common thievery.  The Okhrana just had
 to have a penetration among the dozen or so Socialist and Communist
 deputies.  That little fraction was numerically insignificant in the
 unwieldy Duma, but it was the only body of deputies who knew
 what they wanted and how to plan their action.  And Okhrana agent
 "Ulyanova," who had been reporting on them profusely and re-
 ligiously, had been terminated on 14 June.
 Letter from a Lady
 Ulya.nova's true name was Julia Orestova Serova.  In signing her
 reports she used another alias-Pravdivy, Truthful. She was an edu-
 cated and rather literary woman, a member of the Social Democratic
 Workers Party (Bolshevik) who had never taken a very active part
 in its affairs.  She had probably joined it to please her husband, who
 was a militant Bolshevik, committee member, archivist of the party,
 and its first deputy in the Duma.
 The Okhrana's record of Ulyanova's life and work is replete with
 contradictions.  She was described as a weak character, yet her steady
 and painstaking contributions to the service reveal a hard and con-

 scientious worker.  She loved her husband and was a faithful. wife,
 but she betrayed him daily with reports on his political activities.
 She was described as frugal and a good housewife, yet it was need
 for money that recruited her and she was hungry for bonuses and
 awards on top of her regular monthly pay.  Among the party of iliates
 she was spoken of as a saint and a quiet devotee, she who probably
 had no equal in betraying their trust and causing their arrest in groups.
 She first made contact with the Okhrana in 1905, a write-in.  In a
 letter dated 1 March she offered, for 1000 rubles, to give the under-
 ground locations where the committee of the Social. Democratic
 Workers Party could be found.  She was invited to come to the
 Fontanka, Okhrana headquarters in Petersburg, under secure arrange-
 ments.  She did not obtain 1000 rubles, but half that sum was also
 considerable in the days when an average bourgeois family could
 live on it for six months.  Soon thereafter the entire committee of
 the party was under arrest.
 Ulyanova appears not to have expected this single betrayal to lead
 to any regular connections with the Okhrana.  She needed the money
 at the moment but was not interested in continued employment there-
 after.  But Okhrana headquarters, quite pleased with the first trans-
 action, was inclined otherwise.  A case officer saw her.  He knew
 about the clerical work she did for the party; how simple it would
 be for her to bring him information from the underground office.  By
 collaborating she would be freed of fear of being watched herself.
 No one would suspect her.  And it would give her a regular income.
 She refused.
 But the case officer had her signature on a receipt for 500 rubles.
 Resorting to simple blackmail, he pointed out that what she had
 already done might easily become known, and she would lose her
 husband and family.  Or she might land in the Fortress of Peter
 and Paul where those whom she had betrayed were prisoners;, and
 they might find out that the new prisoner was the one who had
 reported on them. Faced with these consequences of refusal, Ulya-
 nova agreed to continue.  She submitted irregular reports until Sep-
 tember 1907, when, having by now become a willing and even en-
 thusiastic agent, she signed a regular contract providing compensation
 at 25 rubles a month, which eventually grew to 150 a month.

 burg Bolsheviks' internal affairs, she soon extended her purview to

 several other subversive groups.  Her husband had many connec-
 tions.  Serov felt completely safe in his own home.       He had a good,
 taciturn wife with political views identical to his own, and it would
 not have occurred to him not to introduce her to visiting fellow
 conspirators.
 Numerous arrests were made in Petersburg and other cities as a
 result of Ulyanova's disclosures.  In May 1907 her reports made
 possible the capture of an entire revolutionary band which, operating
 out of Vilna, was about to perform a set of "expropriations" from
 banks and the state treasury.  In the same city they led to the dis-
 covery of a load of forbidden literature, including brochures and
 leaflets calling for an armed uprising.  For this she got a 300-ruble
 special award.  In September her information provided legal grounds
 for the arrest of Sergei Saltykov, a Duma deputy.  Her reward of
 500 rubles for this was paid on the day she signed on as a regular
 contract agent.
 Through 1908 Ulyanova kept the Okhrana informed on all meetings
 of the Bolshevik central committee, the composition and structure of
 the organization, and the personnel of many local committees.  In
 April of that year her information led to the arrest of four militants,
 among them Trotzky's brother-in-law Kamenev, in May to the capture
 of an entire underground gathering, and in September to the appre-
 hension of Dubrovski, another member of the central committee.                  In
 February 1909 she brought about the exposure and liquidation of a
 revolutionary printshop in Petersburg and one for counterfeiting pass-
 ports.  Later that year the Bolsheviks sent her abroad to attend a
 conference, and in this connection she made a report on Aleksei
 Rykov.
 These are just the recorded highlights of Ulyanova's work of dis-
 ruption among the Bolsheviks.  Her sources were always authentic,
 derived from her attendance at underground meetings, where she
 frequently served as recorder and general administrative assistant,
 and from activities in her own home, where her husband handled
 party matters and received fellow conspirators.  She was an avid corre-
 spondent, and among the many letters she wrote to friends there were
 interspersed, sometimes daily, reports for delivery to the Okhrana.
 Her sizable salary and awards would probably have led her to
 disaster sooner or later, for she began to spend far beyond her legiti-
 mate means.  Some gossip about this had reached her husband, but

 he remained trustful and never doubted her explanation that she got
 money from her family, who were not poor.  Her undoing came from
 her own carelessness.  As her zeal and practice in the work increased,
 she became slack in her precautions, often copying from her husband's
 papers right at his desk.  One spring day in 1910, coming home un-
 expectedly, he caught her copying his confidential record of a meeting
 held with his Bolshevik deputy colleagues the preceding night,
 Serova tried to make a confused explanation, but he grabbed all
 the papers and saw that she had done the copying in the form of a
 letter to a friend.  "Who is the friend?"  Persistently evasive answers
 to his questions brought him to the point of violence.  After giving
 her a thorough beating on the spot, he chased her out of the house,
 forbidding her ever to return.  She took their two small children with
 her, and she never did return.  On 10 June Serov ran a notice in
 the Petersburg newspaper to the effect that he no longer considered
 Julia Orestova his wife.
 Okhrana director Beletzky fully understood what this announce-
 ment meant.  Four days after it was published a memorandum was
 added to Ulyanova's dossier recording that her name had been deleted
 from the roster of secret agents.  A copy of this memorandum came
 to the attention of the Minister of Interior, who was acquainted with
 Ulyanova's record.  He demanded an explanation from Beletzky.
 Why should such an extraordinarily productive and frequently re-
 warded agent be subject to sudden termination?  The explanation,
 of course, was convincing.
 From then on hounded by her husband, without friends, and with-
 out: income, Ulyanova from time to time contacted her Okhrana bosses.
 In August 1912 she pleaded urgently for help: "My two children, one
 only five years old, are without clothes, and we have no food..  I have
 sold everything, even furniture; I have no work, and if you do not
 help me I will end as a suicide."  She was given 150 rubles.     Other
 letters followed, sometimes pressing and desperate, not seldom threat-
 ening suicide.  All of them elicited some amount or other, 50, 100,
 200 rubles, until they totaled 1800 rubles at the end of 1912.   One
 last letter after that brought her 300 rubles and an order to leave
 Petersburg for good.  She was given transportation for herself and
 children to any place she wanted to go.

 Serova found another husband during the war. Just before the
 first revolution of 1917, she addressed a final letter to headquarters in
 Petersburg:
 "I would like you to recall my good and loyal services.  On the eve
 of great events that we all feel are coming, it hurts me to stay inactive
 and unable to be useful.  My second husband is an excellent man
 and worthy of your confidence.  It would not be difficult for me to
 have him join the Bolsheviks and guide him in the procurement of
 intelligence.  You must realize that that party has to be watched very
 closely now in the interest of all-our Czar, our Empire, and our
 armies."
 The letter was never answered.  She and her husband both perished
 in the revolution.
 Sharzh, Sharni, Sharli, Charlie, Shalnoi
 The Okhrana used these code names for Mme. Zagorskaya, who
 had a remarkably long record of continuous service as an agent and
 was the highest paid of them all.  Her targets were the top leaders
 among the Socialist Revolutionaries, the terrorists, and the Anarchists.
 She worked under the direct supervision of three successive chiefs of
 Paris Okhrana, beginning with Ratayev in 1903, then Harting, and
 finally Krassilnikov until February 1917.
 Because she was handled by the chief rather than staff agents who
 would have to report in detail to the chief, Paris Okhrana files are
 rather meager concerning her activities and stages of growth as an
 agent.  Her full name was Maria Alekseyevna Zagorskaya, nee
 Andreyevna.  She was married to Peter Frantsevich Zagorski, another
 Okhrana agent, who was a Catholic and originally came from Croatia
 in the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  At times the couple worked as a
 team, but she scored her major achievements in her singleton op-
 erations.
 Socialite Couple
 Zagorski had begun his agent work in 1901, having been hired by
 the Okhrana's staff agent Manusevich-Manuilov in Rome and given
 the task of reporting on Polish and Catholic emigres from Russia.
 His wife-to-be was recruited not long after by Ratayev, as head of
 the Okhrana personnel section in Petersburg just before his departure
 to become chief of the Paris station.  The two new agents met at
 Approved CFpA005/01/05 : CIA
 Petersburg when Manuilov brought the young Croat to headquarters
 for training.
 The Okhrana files contain no record of the married life of the
 couple.  They were assigned abroad in early 1903 to work with
 Ratayev, but there the record of Zagorski himself stops for several
 years.   He is described as unusually well qualified, having encyclo-
 pedic knowledge of geography, economics, arts, people, etc.  He was
 therefore not used for ordinary anti-revolutionary operations but
 frequently assigned to missions involving travel as an Austrian subject,
 on which he would report directly to the police directorate. At one
 time he associated with Pilsudski and other Polish and Russian
 rebels and top Anarchists.
 Later Zagorski changed his Austrian citizenship to French, and the
 couple established a home in Paris.  When the revolutionaries, after
 Azev's exposure, started a vigorous campaign to uncover all the
 Okhrana's penetrations, the Zagorskis came under considerable suspi-
 cion.  Both of them were apparently without employment of any
 kind, yet they lived in lordly luxury and gave sumptuous parties.
 Zagorskaya, however, casually let slip food for gossip about their
 family wealth, and her parents were soon spoken of as rich merchants
 while he became known as a great landowner in Croatia.  This tactic
 was successful and suspicion subsided, especially since it was widely
 understood that they distributed a good deal of their wealth in dona-
 tions to various subversive causes.
 Zagorskaya's chief task in all her fifteen years of service was to
 penetrate the leading groups of the Party of Socialist Revolutionaries
 and its Fighting Unit at home and abroad.  To this end she had
 joined the party in Petersburg and won the confidence of the under-
 ground as a capable member who could do much for the cause
 abroad.  She had no difficulty making herself useful not only in the
 central committee of the party headquarters in Paris but among the
 leaders of the terrorist Fighting Unit.  For years she was a close
 friend and associate of the mistress of Boris Savinkov, leader of the
 Fighting Unit, and she maintained a steady correspondence with

 of cabinet ministers of the period.  It was higher than Krassilnikov's
 salary when he became chief of Paris Okhrana in 1910.  He did not
 particularly relish this situation, and he wrote headquarters that her
 accomplishments were not worth the amounts paid her in salary and
 operational expenses.  He not only wanted her salary lowered but
 recommended that he stop handling her directly and turn her over to
 his principal staff agent, Lt. Col. Erhardt.
 It was generally agreed that her services were now less valuable
 than under Ratayev and Harting, from 1903 to 1909, and so her salary
 and expense allowance was cut to 2500 francs a month.  But Kras-
 silnikov did not succeed in transferring her to the staff agent.  She
 enjoyed considerable protection at headquarters, and Okhrana direc-
 tor Vissarionov himself saw to it that her wishes about who should
 direct her work were honored.
 But Krassilnikov persisted.  In 1912 he decided to transfer Zagor-
 skaya to staff agent Erhardt regardless of what attitude headquarters
 might take about it.  Then she wrote, in her own typescript, directly
 to Vissarionov:
 Esteemed Sergei Evlampiyevich:
 A. A. [Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Krassilnikov] told me he received orders
 to discontinue contact with me and transfer me to a different person.  He
 has been proposing this transfer for some time, but I have always refused
 to be transferred and I still insist on refusing.  The reasons A. A. gives for
 this transfer are not valid, and the transfer would cause an unnecessary change
 in my life.  A. A. is known by name and address to many as an official
 representative, but he maintains no open contact with the person to whom
 he wants to assign me.  I find that dealing with this new man would be
 inconvenient and even dangerous.  (I do not need to go into particulars,
 you can see for yourself why it would be dangerous for me.)  Dealing with
 A. A. directly would assure me that our contact will remain strictly clandestine
 and dependable.  A. A. is well known and I can maintain contact with him,
 like so many others, without fear for my security.
 Please consider this aspect-the psychological effect of transferring an
 agent from one case officer to another.  One does not have to be subtle
 to comprehend the feelings of an agent transferred to a new case officer.
 You recall our work together, and you can understand that my work is
 bound to suffer severely from the change . . .
 The lengthy letter begged that Krassilnikov be ordered to continue
 handling her.  Headquarters, after some vacillation, complied, and
 there was no change in case officer.

 Zagorskaya remained in Okhrana employ until the revolution of
 February 1917.  Her husband, however, after joining the French
 army in 1914, was released to fight with the Yugoslav volunteer army
 on the Salonica front.  Agafonov, writing about the Okhrana and
 its agents from the revolutionary point of view, claims that Zagorski
 was exposed as an Austrian agent by the Serbs at Salonica.  Con-
 sidering, however, that it was normal Serbian practice to hang all
 suspects, one may suppose that this allegation was only added color-
 ing to paint the agent still more despicable in the eyes of the Russian
 revolutionaries.
 After the war the Zagorski couple lived quietly in retirement on
 the French Riviera.

 COMMUNICATIONS TO THE EDITORS
 Some New Words for Defection
 Dear Sirs:
 In response to Gordon Cooperwood's appeal in your last issue for
 a new term for defection,' it strikes me that a case can be made for
 the neologism "transcreder" as a noun, or in infinitive form "to trans-
 credo," to shift beliefs or basic values to another creed or credo that
 demands another allegiance.  Of course many defections are not really
 transcreditions, being prompted by less august motives, but I gather
 that Mr. Cooperwood is seeking terminology that may assist a potential
 transcreder to commit the act.
 The simple pairing of Latin roots seems to meet the requirement
 for easy translation or transliteration and avoid susceptibility to un-
 desirable interpretations.  While emotionally neutral in a literal sense,
 the combination may nevertheless be capable of virtuous associations in
 the minds of our adversaries experiencing qualms or disillusionment.
 The shift from falsehood to truth, from a lesser level of belief to a
 higher one in a process of conversion to another value system suggests
 honor and courage.  At the same time the expression appears to be
 accurate enough to describe some of the more notable successes of
 our opponents.
 By focusing on the central core of a man's beliefs the terminology
 seeks to surmount in his own eyes the personal, selfish motivations
 that may underlie his decision to come over.  As with conversion,
 the aura of this term carries an implication that the community of
 fellow believers will welcome a soul tardily emerging from the dark-
 ness.  To this extent our transcreders of the future may be of con-
 tinuing service after the information they bring has been exhausted;
 they can appeal to similar emotions in former compatriots who may
 be susceptible to transcredition.

 In answer to Gordon Cooperwood's inquiry, I suggest a freedom-
 seeking and -promoting defector be called a l i u e r t a r i a n.
 Robert Ausdenmore
 Dear Sirs:
 I suggest Gordon Cooperwood try variations on the old concept
 of seeking and taking sanctuary.  Unfortunately there is no noun for
 one who has taken sanctuary; he is in sanctuary.  This lack could be
 gotten around by use of longer forms: "In taking sanctuary, you . . .";
 "Those who have taken sanctuary from oppression . .." and so on.
 This device associates the ancient right of sanctuary in the Church
 with the sanctity of a freedom which offers sanctuary to the oppressed.

 THE NINJA
 W. M. Trengrouse
 What cowboys have been to U.S. entertainment, the Ninja-the
 stealers-in-are in contemporary Japan.  But a Ninja is less like a
 cowboy than a dirty-dealing Superman.   Originally a medieval cult
 of unconventional warrior-spies, as presented in the vogue now sweep-
 ing Japan from toddlers to grandparents they have the power to turn
 themselves into stones or toads, are as invisibly ubiquitous as grem-
 lins, and can do things like jumping ten-foot walls and walking on
 water.
 Television carries Ninja dramas from morning until night, kabuki
 and the serious stage put on Ninja plays, eighteen Ninja movies were
 made in 1963 and 1964, bookstores carry two hundred fiction and
 non-fiction titles on the occult art, children's comic books and the
 adult pulps are loaded with their adventures, toy stores sell Ninja
 masks and weapons, and even Kellogg's corn flakes has a Ninja mask
 on the box.  It has got to the point that kindergarten classes have
 been asked to pledge they will not play Ninja, the police are plagued
 by moppet bands of Ninja, and hardly a castle wall in Japan has not
 been attacked by amateur Ninja scalers.
 The legend of the stealers-in-as much a part of Japanese culture
 as Robin Hood and King Arthur are of the English-has a reasonably
 firm if little researched basis in history, and its artifacts can be seen
 even today.  The supernatural powers of the popular Ninja character
 are only an exaggeration of some remarkable accomplishments of his
 prototype, some of them strangely similar to things we regard as
 peculiarly modern.  The Ninja did practice the art of invisibility-
 ninjutsu-through choice of clothes and other quite natural means.
 The inventions they used in their profession anticipated the skin-
 diver's snorkel and fins, the collapsible boat, K-rations, the four-
 pronged scatter spike for traffic sabotage, tactical rockets, and water
 skis.
 Origins
 The Ninja most probably began with a group of "mountain ascetics"
 who lived in the hills around Kyoto and Nara when those towns were

 MORI/HRP PAGES 45-52
 CONFIDENTIAL
 the capitals of Japan and Buddhism was being established.  The
 Ninja beliefs and practices show the influence of Buddhism (with a
 mixture of Shinto), of the Chinese way of hand fighting, and of the
 ancient writings of the Chinese Sun Tzu, with his emphasis on spies
 and on stratagems, deception operations.'  By the end of the Nara
 period (710-784) this cult of mountaineers (Yama-bushi, those who
 sleep among the mountains), who were "men of lower caste repre-
 senting the crude side of religion. ... exercised a great influence upon
 the people by appealing directly to vulgar ideas and superstitions." 2
 Occult and dreaded, they lived and taught their blend of Buddhism
 (mainly of the Tendai and Shingon sects, the latter dealing in mystic
 hymns and secret formulas) and Shinto on such mountains as Koya
 and Hiei.  They inducted young men into their secret orders, and
 they came down to the villages to get contributions in return for
 doing magical cures through formulas and medicines.
 But their miracles were not enough to protect them in the face of
 government hostility to the cult, and the priests turned to guerrilla
 warfare, versing themselves in what was to become bujutsu, the mar-
 tial. art of eighteen methods-karate, bojutsu, kenjutsu, and so on-
 to protect their shrines and temples.  These had been established
 twenty miles to the east of Nara at Iga-Ueno, then a farming village
 situated on a broad tableland rimmed by mountains.  The area was
 so poor and isolated that it was not deemed worth fighting for by the
 warring landlords of Nara and Kyoto, and so it went by default to
 the mountaineer cult.  Here ninjutsu became an independent art.
 Before the end of the Heian period (794-1185), the first book treat-
 ing ninjutsu appeared, written by the great Genji warrior Yoshitsune
 Minamoto (1159-1189), the "Book of Eight Styles of Kurama." Mt.
 Kurama, a training station of the mountain ascetics, was where
 Yoshitsune mastered his arts as a child.  This book emphasizes the
 art of flying-Yoshitsune is believed to have been a great jumper-
 and the use of shock troops.  It first distinguished among the three
 arts of strategy, bujutsu, and ninjutsu.  Although ninjutsu was still
 'For example: "In the whole army none should be more favorably regarded
 than the spies; none should be more liberally rewarded than the spies    "  And
 elsewhere, "A stratagem is a military trick.  You should win the enemy to your
 side . . . throw him into confusion . . . break his unity by provocation .
 make him overconfident and relax his guard . .

 embryonic, it was established as an art by Yoshitsune's "book of
 ninjutsu," so referred to and extant today.
 The Iga area was so impoverished that families often killed their
 children, particularly girls, and they could not get their whole liveli-
 hood from farming.  On the other hand adults, or any who could
 perform adult labor, were valuable.  Warfare in the plains of Iga
 therefore tended to be carried on by stealth rather than by bloodshed.
 The mountain priests would teach the head of a strong familly their
 secret arts, and these would be passed from a father to his sons, who
 might also visit the wilderness temples for indoctrination.  Even to-
 day, says playwright-novelist Tomoyoshi Murayama, the people of
 Iga are known as sly, tricky, and crafty.
 Three grades of Ninja sprang up-the jonin (leader), who was
 head of a strong family, the chunin (middle class), a skilled Ninja,
 and the genin (lowest), a day laborer in ninjutsu.  As the people of
 Iga became known for Ninja, fighting landlords in the period of the
 civil wars from the middle of the fourteenth to the end of the six-
 teenth century called upon the town for spies and warriors.  There
 were two major families there, each having about three hundred
 Ninja.  In addition, another settlement at Koga, some twelve miles
 away, had fifty-three families of roughly equal rank with a smaller
 number of Ninja.  The heads of the Iga forces were jonin, those in
 Koga only chunin.
 Masashige Kusunoki, the warrior genius of the latter part of the
 1.4th century, is regarded as the father of advanced ninjutsu.  Like
 Yoshitsune Minamoto, he had learned the basics of the science from
 mountain ascetics as a child, but unlike him used Ninja not only for
 attack but also for defense and peacetime purposes.  According to
 Iga. historian Heishichiro Okuse, he had forty-eight Ninja under him
 who spied in Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe.  One of his exploits, reduc-
 ing an impregnable fortress, was accomplished by locating the enemy's
 supply route, killing the bearers, dressing his Ninja in their armor,
 and sending them on, bearing bags of arms.  When the gates swung
 open the Ninja struck and set fire to the castle. On another occasion,
 after vainly trying to defend his castle from attack, he was found dead
 in his armor by the attackers, his personal Ninja crying over the body.
 But while the enemy were celebrating their triumph, Kusunoki, who
 of course had only been feigning death, arose and crushed them.

 The Ninja's garb was all black.  He wore a black cloth wrapped
 in turban style about his head and covering his mouth and jaw.  His
 cloak was full-sleeved, and the arms ended in gauntlets. Chain mesh
 armor was often worn beneath it.   The pants were baggy, tied above
 the ankle.  Even the socks (tabi) and sandals (zori) were black, with
 cotton padding on the bottom of the zori for stealthy walking.  The
 clothes were filled with hidden pockets.
 The traditional samurai sword was often shortened to leave room
 in the bottom of the scabbard for poisonous dust or blinding-powder
 which could be hurled into an enemy's face.  The hilt was likely to
 be square across, with a long light cord attached, so that the sword
 could be leaned against a wall as a first step in scaling and then pulled
 up afterwards.
 In travelling, the Ninja usually carried the following equipment: a
 straw hood for covering his face except for small holes to see through;
 a rope and hook for climbing; a stone pen for writing on walls; medi-
 cal and food pills (including hyorogan pellets a half inch in diameter
 made of carrot extract, soba powder, wheat flour, mountain potatoes,
 herbs, and rice powder-two or three a day would sustain the Ninja
 for ten days); thirst-allaying tablets made of palm fruit, sugar, and
 barley; medicine to prevent frozen fingers; a lighter flint; and a black
 three-foot towel which could be used in climbing, to hide the face,
 or to carry water purifiers or poison absorbed from secret mixtures
 into which its ends had been dipped.
 One type of weapon was shuriken, missiles which he could hurl with
 pinpoint accuracy for thirty feet.  Usually he had nine of these, either
 metal knives six or so inches long or disks in the shape of stars, comets,
 swastikas, or crosses.  Another was the bamboo pole fitted with a
 hook for climbing or with a balled chain for attack.  More subtle
 were hollowed eggs containing dried jellyfish, toads' eggs, powdered
 snake grass, and powdered leaves from a "sneeze tree"; these were
 thrown to blind or unnerve his opponent.  Water guns, to be shot
 from up wind only, were loaded with a deadly three-second poison.
 ' Most of the information in this section is taken from the 22-volume Bansen
 Shukai (Thousands of Rivers Gather in the Sea), written in 1674 by Natsutake
 Fujibayashi.  Extant in seven manuscript copies, it is now being edited for pub-
 lication.  Notable among the score or more of other 17th- and 18th-century
 accounts of ninjutsu is the volume Shonin-ki (The True Ninjutsu).

 There were poison rings utilizing the all-powerful tiger's nail, and
 leather gloves (shuko) were tipped with iron cat's claws for climbing,
 raking a face, or fending off a sword.
 The Ninja had the secret of gunpowder before it was generally
 known in Japan.  They developed wooden cannons, designed gre-
 nades and time bombs, mounted incendiaries on arrows, and tipped
 arrows with leaf-like ends to scatter the fire.  As anti-personnel weap-
 ons against their soft-shod enemies they scattered sharp-pointed nuts,
 iron tripods with needle points, and solid pyramids of metal which
 would fall upright.
 There were two types of water shoes.  One was a wooden circle
 three feet in diameter with a center of solid board, the other simply
 two buckets, with a wooden fan on a bamboo pole used as a paddle.
 For invisible swimming the Ninja used bamboo tubes as snorkels,
 wooden fins for speed and silence.  The snorkel sometimes had one
 enlarged end and could double as a horn or a blowgun.  Their col-
 lapsible boat folded on its hinges to the size of a filing drawer.  In
 use it would be caulked with sap.   They also used rabbis: skin to
 make floats of the Mae West type.
 The Ninja are credited with developing a secret walk which would
 take them along at twelve miles an hour with less effort than ordinary
 mortals make for four; but this secret, if they had it, has been lost.
 They did use a crab-like walk, crossing one foot over the other and
 moving sideways, for walls and narrow passages.
 They were well versed in nature lore.  To get his direction in the
 dark a Ninja would pull up a radish; the side with more root fibers
 points south.  To find the depth of water in a moat he would pull
 a reed toward him (they can't be pulled up by the roots) and calcu-
 late by a sort of empirical Pythagorean geometry from the submerged
 increment per displacement from the vertical.  From a cat's eyes he
 could read time with the help of a song into which the formula was
 woven.  He watched the tides, currents, constellations, the moon and
 sun, the winds, and the colors of the sky to forecast the weather and
 the best moment to strike (there was another song on the dates of
 currents). A thin sheet of iron heated and then cooled at rest could
 be floated in water to form a crude compass.
 A study of snores observed with a bamboo listening pipe told the
 Ninja the sleep status of their victims.  They learned to, boil rice
 without a pot (wrapping it in a wet straw sack, burying it in the

 ground, and building a fire on top) and freshen salt water (by pack-
 ing red earth on the bottom of the boat to absorb the salt).   A
 wooden fan was used as a protractor to measure angles and thereby
 determine distances.  They had their own secret ideographs and
 coded call signs.  They were adept at "Gojo no Ri," the ability to
 read their opponent's mind and mood from facial indications, voice,
 gesture, etc.
 The Ninja used many disguises, but it is said there were seven basic
 covers-the priest, perhaps offering prayers for the enemy dead while
 making a head count of the quick and a general survey of their battle-
 fields, the mountain ascetic who could spy from above and signal by
 conch shell from mountain top to mountain top, the itinerant merchant
 who could be admitted to castles, the wandering bard and the enter-
 tainer with their songs and tricks, and the commoner.
 The mystical elements of ninjutsu, largely from the Shingon sect,
 took the form of secret hand signs and murmured formulas.  The art
 of invisibility and transformation is also put in mystical terms.  Shu-
 gendo, the mountain ascetic creed, says, "Conceive that you are a
 stone."  If you believe you are a stone, then you are.  It is much
 like becoming one with Buddha.  When the Ninja is surrounded by
 enemies and has no place to escape, he shortens his breath, shrinks
 himself as small as a stone and conceives he is a stone. The enemy
 cannot find him.
 This particular camouflage is called Doton no jutsu, invisibility by
 means of the earth.  But four other elements can be used. In Katon
 no jutsu a man is turned into smoke (helped by liberal use of gun-
 powder in the Ninja practice of blowing one's face off to preserve
 secrecy when cornered).  But this probably refers primarily to the
 use of smoke screens, setting fire to infiltrated castles, etc.  Suiton no
 jutsu is making use of water to disappear, likely with a snorkel.
 Mokuton no jutsu is to hide in trees.  And Kinton no jutsu is the use
 of metal; Ninja would crawl into rice boilers, hanging bells, and
 temple statuary to spy.  A combination of metal and water was to
 steal a large temple bell and jump into deep water with it, making
 use both of its weight and of its trapped air supply.
 Mass Action and Decline
 The last burst of Ninja activity came under Ieyasu Tokugawa (1541-
 1616), who was to become the first shogun of a unified Japan.  On
 February 6th, 1562, the general wrote a letter of gratitude to a Koga

 Ninja, Yoshichiro Ban, for services rendered two years before.  ][eyasu
 had had to attack an impregnable castle (we gather all castles were
 impregnable until the Ninja were called in) and had asked Ban to
 lead 280 Ninja in an infiltration movement.  This band slipped in
 at night and fired the castle towers.  The defenders thought their
 own men had betrayed them and fell into confusion.  The Ninja
 totally disrupted them without use of staff or sword except to behead
 the enemy leader.
 Two other generals, however, who helped in the unification of the
 country, Nobunaga Oda (1534-1582) and Hideyoshi Toyotomi (1536-
 1598) were trying to stamp out Buddhism and therefore not only re-
 buffed but held and tortured any Ninja who fell into their hands.  In
 1581, 9000 of Oda's men attacked a force of 4000 men from Iga, in-
 cluding many Ninja, laid waste the town, and slaughtered its warriors.
 Ninja leader Hanzo Hattori, lamenting the death of his townsmen,
 asked Ieyasu to employ the survivors, and the great general did.
 Then in the battle of Sekigahara (1600), 100 Ninja of the 200 in
 the Ieyasu forces were killed.
 In the first years of the 17th century, when Ieyasu as shogun moved
 the political capital of the country to Edo (Tokyo), he took 200 Ninja
 with him.  He made Hanzo and his successors the equivalent of U.S.
 Secret Service chiefs.  The Ninja had complete and unquestioned
 access to the shogun to protect and inform him.  (The main west
 entrance to the Imperial Palace, then the shogun's residence, is still
 called Hanzo's gate, and parts of Tokyo where the Ninja lived are
 now named Koga-cho, Iga-cho, and Kogai-cho.)     Their cover was
 gardener employment, and they lived it.  But they were always ready
 to be stopped among the poppies with the order, "Go to Kyoto," and
 they would drop their spades and set out at once at Ninja speed.
 In 1638, when farmers and Christians in Shimabara, Kyushu, re-
 belled against the shogunate, Ninja were called in again, this time
 strictly to gather information.  The fight had lasted ten months, and
 40,000 rebels were holding the Shimabara castle (impregnable) against
 130,000 of Ieyasu's troops.  Finally the commanding general, Nobu-
 tsuna Matsudaira, ordered ten Ninja to reconnoiter the castle.  "We
 have no idea of the layout inside the enemy camp," he said. "De-
 termine the depth and width of the moat, the height of the wall and
 fence, and the distance from our camp to theirs; and draw a map."
 Five Ninja fired guns as a diversion.  After the consequent enemy
 stir had subsided, at midnight, the Ninja moved in from the opposite

 side, scaling the castle wall with rope ladders.  Two of them fell
 into traps in the floor, and this aroused the guards.  Nevertheless the
 Ninja, with their black garb and ability to work in the dark, accom-
 plished their mission, and they carried off the enemy's cross-bearing
 flag as well.
 With the coming of peace, however, the Ninjas, like old generals,
 now faded into the administrative spy and other dull professions.

 most extensive and detailed series of memoranda contained: in the
 OSS Reports to the White House 1 is formed by those that trace the
 evolution from monarchist Yugoslavia to the Tito dictatorship, a course
 of events in which Roosevelt and particularly Winston Churchill played
 a hand.  In Yugoslavia OSS had representatives with both of the feud-

 include among the latter the man whom Churchill later forced upon
 King Peter as prime minister and who still later became Tito's first
 foreign minister, the Croatian leader Ivan Subasic.  In London it had
 a representative who enjoyed the intimate confidence both of Subasic
 and of Peter and whose reports reflect minutely the political develop-
 ments.  The most important of the documents are excerpted' below.

 The Ban told me that it would aid him tremendously in carrying out
 his duties, and would greatly facilitate his future tasks, if he could
 have an interview with you, not in his diplomatic capacity,3 but merely
 as a patriot who is working for the common cause.  . . .
 The Ban, who fought in the last war as a Serbian officer, is very
 popular among the 5,000,000 Croats.  They regard him as their cham-
 pion and leader.
 I believe that the Ban can be of great value to us in paving the way
 for our forces.  .. .
 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 ... here is additional information on the Balkan situation:
 "1. All political leaders, with the exception of the fighting forces,
 are regarded apathetically by the people.  The fighting forces are
 composed of two parts-the Cetniks, lead 4 by Mihailovitch, and the
 Partisans, led by Tito.  Nearly all the Cetnik units are east of the Tara
 and Drina Rivers in old Serbia.  Their strength is customarily ex-
 aggerated.  .. .  These men are nearly all Serbians.  Disturbances
 among the population are created by Mihailovich's title as Jugoslav
 commander-in-chief and Minister of War, which is obviously opposed
 to fact.
 'T. The Partisans are led by Tito, whose true name is Josip Broz.
 Their official designation is the National Army of Liberation. They
 are made up of men from every region of the country and they are
 engaged in hostilities in every part of the country, even including old
 Serbia.  This is in favorable contrast to Mihailovich's relative lack of
 activity and narrow field.  Each day, Tito's forces are growing... .
 "3. Included in the political goals of the Partisans is the establish-
 merit of federated Jugoslavia with a government selected by democratic
 ' In 1942 he had been named by the government in exile to a mission for
 organizing the Yugoslavs in the United States.
 ' Misspellings retained as a matter of documentary interest throughout.

 elections.  This aim is extremely popular.  There is no factual founda-
 tion for the allegation of communism made against the Partisans.
 Such inclinations are found only among a small part of the rank and
 file or the leaders.
 "4. The Government-in-Exile anticipates that Mihailovitch, with
 assistance from the Allies, will reestablish the monarchy with the pres-
 ent cabinet and with Pan-Serbian inclinations.  . . .  The Govern-
 ment is not representative of the population, and causes controversy
 between factions which frequently terminate in grave clashes.  The
 people are irritated that the United States and Britain protect the
 Government-in-Exile.
 "7. Outside of old Serbia and with the exception of some of the
 Slovene clericals, who are a tiny part of the Slovenes, the monarchy
 is quite unpopular today.  King Peter is popularly believed to be a
 youth under the control of political and officer cliques possessing
 Pan-Serbian inclinations.  The population is irritated by the sizeable
 allowance made to Peter and particularly by his becoming engaged,
 during the war, to Alexandra.
 "8. There is no genuine understanding between the Government-in-
 Exile and the Soviet Union.  The principal barrier to such an under-
 standing is Mihailovitch.                                                                                                                       Although it is frequently stated in rumors,
 there is no definite evidence which can be obtained of an accord be-
 tween the Partisans and the Soviet Union.  . . ."
 .Attached is a copy of memorandum which I am submitting today
 to the joint Chiefs of Staff. It has to do with the British request for
 concurrent withdrawal of British and American officers now with
 Mihailovich.
 Attached to the memorandum is an intelligence report by an OSS
 officer who has been with Mihailovich during the past six months.  I
 believe that it will be of much interest to you.

 Here is a digest of discussions had by a representative of ours with
 King Peter:
 King Peter's sojourn in Cairo was both futile and difficult for
 the following reasons:
 (a) General Zivkovic was engaged in plots directed toward
 deposing Peter and placing Prince Tomislav, the brother of Peter,
 on the throne.  Supposedly, Prince Tomislav is the bastard son
 of General Zivkovic and Queen Marie.
 (b) Yugoslav army officers have been going over to Marshal
 Tito.
 (c) Cabinet underlings have issued inflammatory decrees favor-
 ing General Mihailovic and have been affixing King Peter's signa-
 ture to these decrees without his consent.  This has made it hard
 to work for an understanding with Tito.
 (d) The British have followed a policy of keeping King Peter
 practically a prisoner.  King Peter verified newspaper accounts
 reporting this fact, although he was forced to refute them publicly
 at the time.
 The foregoing factors, as well as his desire to affect American
 and British policy in favor of General Mihailovic and to expedite
 his marriage were responsible for his wishing to go back to
 London.
 The agreed policy of the Purich cabinet and King Peter is the
 backing of General Mihailovic not only as a force opposed to
 the Nazis but also as a guarantee of Peter's ultimate return to the
 Yugoslav throne.  They are also agreed on the policy of securing
 material assistance for Mihailovic.  King Peter ... intimated that
 if the British did not order him to do otherwise, he would keep
 Punch in his present position.  .. .
 Purich.  . . . No Croats have been asked to participate in the discus-
 sions to date, on the theory that agreement must first be reached
 among the Serbian factions.  .. .
 3. Neither the King nor the British Foreign Office has been con-
 tacted by this group as yet; ..."

 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 Here is a report sent to me by one of our representatives on state-
 merits made by the Ban of Croatia on his departure for England:
 "... The Yugoslav crisis is due primarily in his opinion to the utter
 weakness of the present government.  His advice, if sought by the
 King, will be to suggest the formation of a strong government under
 the King.  .. .
 "The great mistake in the past has been that the Allied governments,
 because of the weakness of the Yugoslav governments-in-exile, dealt
 directly with General Mihailovic and Marshal Tito.  .. .
 "The Shepherds believes that if a strong government is set up the
 first task would be to relegate General Mihailovic and Marshal Tito to
 their legitimate tasks, namely, military commanders of the resistance
 forces within the respective areas controlled by each one of them
 separately.  The only effective way to bring about such a situation
 would be for the Allies to give all military assistance and supplies
 through the government only.  .. .
 "Finally, the Shepherd stated that if a strong government is now
 formed, it must seek, as stated above, by exercising its authority, to
 consolidate all resistance forces throughout Yugoslavia in order to
 achieve the maximum effort to conquer the enemy.  .. ."
 22 May 1,944
 From our London office, we learn the following:

 In view of the secrecy maintained by the British on this conference,
 apart from this report to you, I am having only the Secretary of State
 advised.  .. .
 "The Ban informed me yesterday that he had received a telephone
 call from Churchill's secretary, requesting him to have dinner with
 Churchill at the lattcr's country place . . . on Sunday, 21 May .. .
 The Ban, . . . accompanied by Mr. Stevenson, British Minister to
 Yugoslavia, . . . arrived there about noon.  . . .
 "At one o'clock, Mr. Churchill joined them and during the dinner
 he had the Prime Minister of Holland seated at his right and the Ban
 at his left.  Addressing his guests and pointing to the Ban, Mr.
 Churchill said: `I want you to meet the next Prime Minister of Yugo-
 slavia.'          Noticing the expression of surprise on the Ban's face, Mr.
 Churchill said to him: `Why don't you know that you are going to be
 the Prime Minister of the new Yugoslav Government?'  The Ban
 replied: `The King consulted with me regarding the formation of a
 new government but has not as yet informed me of the fact that I am
 to be the Prime Minister of that Government and that I will be en-
 trusted with its formation.'  Mr. Churchill then said: `Why of course.
 That is the reason I asked you to come here.'
 "Thereafter . . . Mr. Churchill stated . . . that he consulted, of
 course, with the President of the United States about the formation
 of this new government under the premiership of the Ban and was
 assured of his complete approval.
 "Turning to the Ban, Churchill then said: 'You will form this gov-
 ernment and I assure.you that Great Britain and the United States
 will regard yours as the only government of the Yugoslav people, and
 within four or five weeks you will get all the support and assistance
 we can possibly render to your country to increase its resistance to
 the enemy.'  . . .
 "Churchill further added: `We shall continue to have friendly rela-
 tions with Tito because he is conducting a vigorous campaign in Yugo-
 slavia, but we shall look to you and your cabinet as the only legitimate
 government of Yugoslavia.'
 "Churchill informed the Ban that he had informed Tito that, if he is
 in favor of the new government, his support will be very welcome,
 but at any rate he must refrain from attacking it and thereby disrupting
 the earnest attempt which will be made by the new government to
 ApprovC6h9r  N,p&e 2005/01/05
 unify Yugoslavia.  . . .  He frankly did not know what the attitude of
 Stalin would be.   He expressed the hope that the USSR will join
 with England and America in giving whole-hearted support to the
 new government but had no information on that point up to the
 present.
 `... On the way home Mr. Stevenson spoke to the Ban about the
 conference with Churchill.  The Ban pointed out to him that whereas
 the Prime Minister took it for granted that he is the future Premier,
 the King has not advised him as yet that he is entrusted to form the
 government.  The Ban then said that he is contemplating calling
 King Peter tomorrow, Monday, May 22nd, and informing him of the
 conference with Churchill so as to bring the matter to a head.  ..."

 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 The following is a paraphrase of a cable from General Donovan
 which he asked be delivered to you:
 "I had lunch with General Sir Maitland Wilson today.            General
 Wilson stated that the conversations between Tito and Subasich went
 better than anticipated.  The following was agreed upon:
 'T The Subasich Government would have a Tito representative.
 "2. As part of his Army, Tito would accept Mihailovich troops who
 would be allowed to wear the Royal insignia as distinguished from
 Tito's red star.  This would also apply to Naval forces.
 "3. That ultimate determination of the King's position would be
 put off until after the war was over.
 Wilson remarked that the chasing around the mountains which the
 Nazis gave Tito had had a healthful effect.  Both Peter and Subasich
 are going back to London."
 25 August 1.944
 General Donovan (who is presently in London) has asked that the
 following report of a conversation he had on 21 August with Prime
 Minister Subasich be sent to you from him:

 "I talked with Subasich on Monday and he told me the fol-
 lowing:
 "'On August 20 I had a conversation with Adam Pribicevich,
 Vice President of Draga Mihailovich's Committee.  When Pribice-
 vich asked for my help to stop the Partisans' fight against the
 Chetniks, which is now raging with full intensity and when he
 asked me whether we could bring about a reconciliation between
 the Partisans and the Chetniks, I answered:
 " . . . If you wish to fight the Partisans as. Communists-con-
 scious of the fact that they are sons of our nation-and to this
 end, accept the help and collaboration of the Germans, you cannot
 expect anything from the King, the Royal Government or the
 Allies.  . ..' "
 There has also been received from our representative in Bern the
 following Boston Series report', which is of direct relevance to the
 matters discussed in General Donovan's talk with Subasic.  . . .
 "During the second week of August, 1944, Hermann Neubacher,
 German special plenipotentiary for the Balkan area, is reported to have
 made the following comments on Mihailovich and the political situa-
 tion in Yugoslavia:
 " `... The position of those Chetniks who advocate cooperation
 with the Germans is strengthened by the fact that the latter may
 soon be forced to evacuate Serbia.  This would be the signal for
 a show-down engagement between the Communists and the Na-
 tionalists.  Mihailovich therefore probably intends to cooperate
 with the German Army while it is still in Serbia, in order to lessen
 the effectiveness of Tito's Partisans. By emphasizing the common
 fight against Communism, Mihailovich would obtain as many
 weapons as possible from the Germans.  He feels that he will
 then be able to take over the German positions easily when the
 German army leaves.  Informal negotiations between Mihailo-
 vich and the Germans are said to have been initiated, and
 may possibly be followed by an official conference at a later
 date.'  . . .'

 "2 C-47's, with stars on the rudders, landed on Vis Monday
 evening with Russian Yak fighter escort.  Tito left in one of them

 Vis.  Major Alston and Colonel Maxwell, British Army, have

 24 September 1944
 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 I am sending to you the following paraphrase of message sent by
 General Wilson to Marshal Tito on 16 September, and a report from
 our Bari office concerning an order issued by Marshal Tito's head-
 quarters on 20 September restricting intelligence operations loth of
 ourselves and the British.  .. .
 General Wilson's message to Marshal Tito:
 "1. A communication was addressed by you on the 5 of Septem-
 ber to the British and American missions at your Headquarters,
 in which you made a statement to the effect that the Chetniks
 were being sent supplies and afforded other aid by the Allies, and
 that the Allied command in Italy is maintaining relations with
 Draga Mihailovich.
 "2. It is not my plan to send these to either the British or the
 United States governments as a strong exception to these allega-
 tions is taken by me personally.  I am perfectly competent to
 take care of the situation as the Allied officer personnel to which
 you made reference in your communication of the 5 of September
 are under my direct orders.
 "3. In any event, you have apparently been misinformed.  The
 statement that we are sending Mihailovich any supplies or main-
 taining relationship with him is absolutely false.  At the time,
 you were made aware of the special reasons for which the two
 American missions have been in the region that Mihailovich con-
 trols.  The evacuation of Allied air personnel in Yugoslavia was

 the specific reason of the first mission, the air crew rescue unit.
 A small unit under direction of Col. McDowell, the second mis-
 sion, is in no way accredited to General Draga Mihailovich; its sole
 object is to collect intelligence in Serbia.
 "6. The fact that on a few occasions rescued American airmen
 were brought out garbed in Chetnik clothing because of the loss
 of their own, may have caused some misunderstanding.  A few
 supplies, which may have been dropped in the wrong area, may
 have fallen into the hands of the Chetniks.  The complaints made
 by you must be wholly based on erroneous reports which resulted
 from distortion of the facts stated above."
 Report concerning order issued by Marshal Tito's Headquarters
 on. 20 September:
 "Tito's headquarters issued orders on September 20 to all Par-
 tisan corps commanders to the effect that no Allied missions may
 operate henceforth with units smaller than a corps and further
 that no Allied military personnel are to travel inside the country
 unless Tito has given them written permission to do so.  The Par-
 tisan Istrian Corps Headquarters has ordered one of our officers
 stationed in Slovenia to report to the headquarters without delay.
 This order was in fulfillment to Tito's order.
 "According to the British military mission, similar communica-
 tions have been received by its representatives in other areas.  All
 supply drops were immediately cancelled by the British and also
 all flights to remove Partisan wounded.  Nothing further will be
 done along either line until the situation is clarified.  .. .
 "Probably the motive behind Tito's move is his desire to curtail
 and control American and British military representation in the
 country now that he believes the civil war is all but in the bag and
 now that British and American supplies are no longer needed.  He
 evidently does not wish American and British representatives to
 observe and report developments of his plans to consolidate his
 military victory in the political and economic field.  The order,
 significantly enough, was issued at a moment when Tito was
 almost certainly with the Russian leaders in Bulgaria or Rumania.
 He has not come back to Vis since he left for an undisclosed

 destination in Russian planes.  There is no way of knowing if
 the Russians come under the phrase "allied" personnel.
 "The Russians have for a long time had the closest possible
 liaison with Tito and his staff and have probably taken part in
 his political and military councils.
 30 September 1944
 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 We have just received word from Colonel Huntington, Chief of our
 group with Tito, that the Partisan Headquarters have been moved to
 Serbia.
 The British and Russian groups, as well as our own, are in the
 process of transferring their personnel to the new headquarters.
 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 I believe that you will find of interest the following report of con-
 versations which our representative, Mr. Bernard Yarrow, had with
 the King of Yugoslavia and with Subasic:
 "On Wednesday September 27, I saw the King.  He gave me a warm
 welcome and spent an hour with me chatting about the present situa-
 tion.  He told me ... that Winston Churchill sent a sizzling telegram
 to Tito telling him in effect that the British Government has sent
 supplies and arms to Tito to fight the enemy and not to fight his own
 people.  The King also said that this cable which was of a challenging
 tone and the sharpest yet delivered to Tito was provoked by a certain
 note sent by Tito to Churchill.  Two days later this ... was con-
 firmed by Subasic independently and without any questioning on my
 part.  Subasic told me that Tito sent a cable to Churchill protesting
 vehemently against assistance rendered by the British to certain Chet-
 niks in Switzerland and to other acts of assistance to M:ihailovich.
 Subasic further informed me that Churchill sent to Tito a reply in
 which lie rebuked him sharply for using arms and ammunition sup-
 plied by the British Government to fight the Yugoslav people instead
 of fighting the enemy.

 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 We have just received the following dispatch from our representa-
 tive, Mr. Bernard Yarrow, concerning a cable which Subasic has re-
 ceived from Stalin:
 "Tonight Subasic informed me that he received a cable directly
 from Stalin in which Stalin stated that the National Committee
 of Liberation agreed to the Red Army's entrance into Yugoslavia.
 "Stalin stated that the Red Army will liberate the Yugoslav
 people from the yoke imposed by the enemy.  Stalin extended his
 best wishes to Subasic personally as the Prime Minister of Royal
 Yugoslav Government to carry out successfully the policies in-
 augurated by his government.
 "Subasic asked that contents of cable from Stalin to him not
 be wired to Washington because he has not informed the British
 about it."
 In view of the nature of this communication and the fact that the
 value of our informant might be seriously jeopardized, Mr. Yarrow
 has requested that contents of the message not be revealed.
 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 The following report from our representative, Mr. Bernard Yarrow,
 will, I believe, be of interest to you:
 ".. . Subasic lunched with Churchill on August 3 and asked him
 to provide two divisions to invade Yugoslavia, promising to capture
 Belgrade with assistance of Yugoslav troops within short time.
 Churchill stated cannot spare two divisions but assured Subasic of
 whole-hearted support.  Before leaving for Quebec, Anthony Eden
 spoke to Subasic about moving government to Italy in anticipation of
 liberation of Yugoslavia.  Subasic heard no more about it and is
 mystified by British verbal promises of support and lack of any real
 backing.  Subasic believes that British in concert with Soviets working
 with Tito only, disregarding royal Government."
 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 The following dispatch which we have just received from our repre-
 sentative, Mr. Bernard Yarrow, will, I believe, be of interest to you:
 "Saturday October 7 Churchill conferred with King Peter.  The
 King telephoned Subasic from 10 Downing Street asking him to prepare
 a speech to be broadcast by the King upon liberation of Belgrade.
 Churchill wanted to see the speech by 5 P.M.  The speech was pre-
 pared on time.  Briefly, the King will congratulate people of Yugo-

 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 King Peter saw Churchill this afternoon.  Herewith report as
 given me [Yarrow] by King.  Stalin and Churchill discussed general
 Balkan situation.  . . . Yugoslavia military operations and adminis-
 tration upon liberation will be under joint British-Russian control.
 ... Stalin was not in principle against re-establishment of Monarchies
 in Balkans.  He said, `If a King can be more useful in waging war
 against enemy and maintaining stability after victory, he would prefer
 him to a makeshift Republic.'  Specifically as to Peter Stalin said,
 'Ile seems to be a young man who is close to his people.'  But insisted
 that question of King's return be postponed until people express will by
 plebescite.  Churchill added, `When time comes I shall see to it that
 plebescite is conducted under British, Russian and American super-

 vision.'  Churchill smilingly said, `I shall manage your campaign when
 time comes.'
 King informed Churchill that he learned . . . that Subasic before
 departure harbored plan to create Regency commission and appoint-
 ing himself as member of same.  King expressed anxiety that Subasic
 will attempt to perpetuate own political power and is not person upon
 whom King can rely to fight for his return.  Churchill said that this
 regency idea was news to him and that it is despicable that Subasic
 promoted it.  He assured King that if regency is suggested to him by
 Subasic or anyone, he will rudely reject it.  Ile said, `You are neither
 minor nor at your death bed or mentally deficient, therefore there can
 be no question of appointing regent.'  Churchill amplified that if
 regent were appointed his acts of malfeasance would be charged
 against King hence unacceptable.  Churchill made a note to send
 word immediately to British representative participating Tito-Subasic
 conferences  and warn him of Subasic's regency -scheme.  . . .
 Churchill said that when he met with Tito and Subasic in Italy it was
 he who fought the battle of the Monarchy with Tito and not Subasic.
 Churchill said that Tito is only a Communist and will try to put one
 of his followers as Prime Minister who will exercise very little power,
 Tito retaining same.
 King asked Churchill to arrange conference between him and Tito
 in Churchill's presence.  Churchill said, `It is premature now but I
 will seek the [U.S.] President's opinion as to the advisability of such
 a meeting.'
 Churchill expressed view that King should not under any circum-
 stances be on Yugoslav soil at present.  First because lie does not
 wish by King's presence to legalize some of the misdeeds perpetrated
 by Tito against some of Yugoslav people.  Second that it would be
 easy to assassinate him and then claim that he was murdered by
 German agent or Mihailovich henchmen.     Churchill expressed an-
 noyance at ... Minister of Defence placing Royal Yugoslav Air Force
 and Navy under Tito's command.  He said that he received word from
 his Admiral commanding Mediterranean that he will not tolerate same.
 Finally Churchill reassured King that he need not worry about
 Subasic-Tito conference for any agreement will have to get. his sanc-
 tion.  Ile said that Stalin was not unreasonable about general Balkan
 situation but that of course Stalin is a very shrewd man and situation
 will have to be watched.

 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 .. . From Mr. Yarrow:
 "The King received a telephone message from Sir Alexander Cado-
 gan requesting an audience at 2:30 P.M. on 2 November.  Cadogan
 stated he had a message from Mr. Churchill and handed a written
 memorandum the text of which is as follows:
 `Memorandum on agreement reached between Marshal Tito and
 Dr. Subasic.  In accordance with the terms of this agreement, King
 Peter would appoint a council of 3 regents to represent his Majesty
 in Yugoslavia, pending the decision of the country on the ultimate form
 of government.  . . .  The regents would form a government of 18
 ministers from the members of Dr. Subasic's government and of the
 National Committee.  It would be the task of the united government
 to conduct the plebiscite which would eventually decide upon the form
 of government of the country.  . . .  The Prime Minister would be
 Marshal Tito, who would also be Minister of Defense and Com-
 mander-in-Chief.  . . .  Dr. Subasic is proceeding to Moscow ... to
 ascertain for himself the attitude of the Soviet Government towards
 Yugoslavia.
 "Cadogan then asked the King whether he had any message for Mr.
 Churchill.  The King stated, `Please tell Mr. Churchill that   . I was
 shocked by this agreement and I shall not accept it.'  Cadogan then
 informed the King that Mr. Churchill expressed consternation at sud-
 den departure of Subasic for Moscow without first reporting to Church-
 ill and to King Peter.  He further stated that he was not consulted by
 Subasic as to details of the agreement.  Churchill accordingly, said
 Cadogan, sent a cable to the British Ambassador in Moscow instructing
 him to ask Subasic to proceed immediately to London to report to
 King Peter and Churchill.  Churchill also sent cable to Stalin inform-
 ing him that neither Churchill nor King Peter were consulted by
 Subasic during his conference with Tito with respect to agreement
 and specifically asked him not to make any decisions until Churchill
 had opportunity to get a complete report of the agreement and until
 CIA-RDP78T03&4Ar0662Tdbb30001-0
 We have also received from our representative in Belgrade a con-
 current report concerning the Tito-Subasic agreement . .. .
 11. . . Subasic said that Tito was very reasonable although urged
 by followers who are anxious to set up a federated republic im-
 mediately.  Subasic indicated the regency compromise agreement by
 Tito was only to obtain immediate recognition of United States and
 England.  If this recognition is withheld I feel that the agreement
 might weaken.
 "Subasic plans to go to Moscow tomorrow for three or four days
 and will sign agreement when he returns provided presumably Peter
 agrees."
 The OSS representative in London has forwarded the following ac-
 count of an interview between Prime Minister Churchill and King
 Peter.  The information was received from King Peter immediately
 following the interview on 17 November:
 Churchill, holding in his hand a copy of the proposed agreement
 between Tito and Subasich, commented to King Peter that the draft
 could have been worse and that it represented at least a partial victory
 because it recognized, for the time being, the constitutional Monarchy.
 "As you know," Churchill added, "I am against a Regency.  . . .  I
 thought Subasich was statesman enough to see the inadvisability of
 such a step.  But I believe this clause may be eliminated; the agree-
 ment is not yet final."
 King Peter told Churchill that he regarded the agreement as a polite
 way to oust the King quietly, that ... he wished to disavow Subasich
 immediately for transgressing his powers and for proceeding to Moscow
 without first reporting to him.  This comment, however, is said to
 have infuriated Churchill, who warned the King under no circum-
 stances to take any action before Subasich has returned to Lon-
 don.  . . .
 Churchill reportedly added: "You know I do not trust Tito.  Ile
 surreptitiously flew to Moscow to meet with Stalin before my arrival
 in London.  He is nothing but a Communist thug, but he is in power
 and we must reckon with that fact.  President Roosevelt, Stalin, and I
 have agreed that there will be a plebiscite by which the people of
 Yugoslavia will decide on the question of the Monarchy.  Your re-

 turn, therefore, will have to be postponed until the plebiscite takes
 place."  The King replied, "What chance have I in a plebiscite when
 Tito is in Yugoslavia?  It will be nothing but a farce."  Churchill
 then stated that he would insure that the plebiscite would be super-
 vised by "impartial umpires" including "British, Americans and
 Russians."
 During, the conversation, the King said, "I have followed your advice,
 Mr. Prime Minister, since I escaped from Yugoslavia, and look where
 I am today."  To which Churchill replied, "Would you have been
 better off if you had followed Mihailovich?"
 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 ... In a lengthy conversation with the OSS representative in Bel-
 grade on 5 December, Subasich indicated that his visit to Moscow
 had been a difficult ordeal.  Much time was spent discussing questions
 of government procedure pending a plebiscite, which Subasich feels
 will take place six months after the complete liberation of Yugoslavia.
 According to Subasich, Stalin insisted on the free expression of popular
 opinion in Yugoslavia and expressed abhorrence of any Yugoslav "ex-
 periments" in Communism or Bolshevism.  Stalin appeared shocked
 to learn that some delegates to the Serb congress (the Supreme Anti-
 Fascist Assembly of National Liberation of Serbia, held in mid-
 November 1944) were elected by acclaim, which he characterized
 as an undemocratic procedure.
 Subasich reportedly admitted to British authorities in Belgrade that
 the return of King Peter was out of the question at present.  To the
 OSS representative Subasich admitted surprise at the attitude of the
 Serbs, whom he had considered monarchists, and added that if King
 Peter were to return it would cause riots and disorders.  . . .
 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 . MacLean has shown the OSS representative in Belgrade a
 lengthy, strongly-worded, and slightly menacing message from Church-
 to Tito, protesting against the non-cooperative and discourteous
 ill
 attitude of Tito and his subordinates toward the British.  The message
 mentioned a number of incidents involving ApprovedlFor Relea military

 operations on the Dalmatian coast.  MacLean states that Tito ap-
 peared much disturbed by the communication and offered profuse
 apologies.  At the same time, however, Tito complained that the
 British had failed to keep him informed of their operations, and stated
 that the incidents were due largely to the unexpected appearance of
 strong British forces in various areas.
 Churchill's message also emphasized the necessity for genuinely
 democratic elections in implementing the Tito-Subasich agreement,
 and expressed the hope that all democratic groups will be free to
 put forward their candidates and support them in election campaigns.
 Churchill added that he expects the question of the monarchy will be
 put directly to the electorate and that the vote will be by free and
 secret ballot.  (Subasich had informed the OSS representative in Bel-
 grade that present plans call for a constitutional assembly and not the
 electorate to decide this issue.)
 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 ... From our representative Mr. Bernard Yarrow ...
 "King saw Churchill at 3:00 P.M. on 13 December. The conference
 lasted 1 hour.  .. .
 "In discussing Tito-Subasic agreement Churchill said, `I advise
 you to sign this agreement for with it the constitutional monarchy
 is helped to some extent and it is not as bad as it looks,  If you
 sign it there is still a chance for you.  If you refuse to sign Tito may
 form his own government and banish you forever from Yugoslavia.
 I cannot make up your mind for you.  It will have to be your own
 decision.  You are your own master.       Think about it and don't rush.
 You can take your time and we shall discuss it further.'  Churchill
 suggested that King and Subasic meet with him on Friday at 5:00
 P.M.  King agreed.  . . ..
 Subsequent to the receipt of the report set forth above we have
 just received another dispatch dated 14 December 1944 from 'Mr.
 Yarrow, which reads as follows:
 "King Peter decided to seek advice and assistance of godfather,
 King George of England.  Peter telephoned him today and will
 see King George this afternoon or tomorrow morning."

 CONFIDENTIAL
 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 We have just received by pouch a report of a conference which
 our representative Mr. Bernard Yarrow had with Subasic on 15 De-
 cember 1944.  . . .
 "Yesterday, December 15, I had a long discussion with Prime Min-
 ister Subasic.  Knowing him as I do for the last two years, I should
 like to say that I am pretty certain that he spoke his mind to me
 and was utterly frank in those matters which he related.  . . .
 "When Subasic got to Bari on his last trip, he was met by an
 official of the British Foreign Office, Mr. Philip Broad.  Mr. Broad
 suggested that he accompany the Prime Minister on his trip to Yugo-
 slavia, to which the Prime Minister replied that he appreciated
 very much the kindness of Mr. Broad to be of assistance to him
 but he preferred to conduct his negotiations with Tito alone.  He
 amplified his statement by saying that he did not wish it to be said
 among the National Committee of Liberation that he was traveling
 around with a British representative of the Foreign Office.  .. .
 "The Prime Minister related to me that when he first got to
 Belgrade after its liberation he knew by that time that he was con-
 demned on an alleged indictment that he was responsible for the
 death of many communists, whom he interned before the Germans
 advanced into Yugoslavia, because he did not release them in time.
 Instead of evading the issue, said the Prime Minister, he delivered
 a two hour talk before the National Committee of Liberation in the
 presence of Tito, who brought him into the Assembly.  He told me
 how, after the two hour talk, he convinced them that he was not
 responsible in any manner for the deaths at the hands of the Germans.
 "He told them of his impressions of America and I could gather
 that he tried to give them the impression that he was very well
 acquainted with the policy of the American Government, has con-
 tacts with officials of that Government and would be in a position
 to handle Yugoslav affairs more successfully because of his presence
 in America for two years and the contacts established by him there.
 "The attitude of the members of the National Committee of Lib-
 eration towards him was, according to Subasic, most cautious and
 distant.  He heard rumors that they were regarding him as a spy
 and agent for King Peter II and were most uncommunicative with him.
 Approved For Release 2005/01/05  C
 "The Russians, during his stay in Belgrade, were exceedingly cor-
 dial to him and showed every sign of consideration and attention.
 Ile struck up a friendship with General Kornieff, who was the head
 of the Russian military mission in Yugoslavia.  It was Kornieff who
 had a large comfortable chair built in the Douglas plane which took
 him eventually from Belgrade to Rumania.  Later on Subasic got
 to know and became very friendly with Colonel Melnikoff, who,
 although a colonel in rank, has more authority and power, according
 to Subasic, than General Kornieff.  It was Melnikoff who accom-
 panied the Prime Minister to Russia when he undertook his trip to see
 Stalin.
 "The Prime Minister related to me the following incident: before
 his departure from Yugoslavia to Ploesti, General Kornieff asked him
 whether he would prefer to fly in a Russian or Yugoslav plane, that
 they were both of the Douglas model built in Russia.  Kornieff said
 he was asking the question because on the Yugoslav plane there
 was the Red Star emblem.  The Prime Minister replied to Kornieff
 that he did not mind the star as long as the plane was a Yugoslav
 plane.
 "The Prime Minister spoke to me at length about Tito.     He told
 me he found Tito to be exceedingly reasonable, that although he
 is a devoted communist by `religion' he found no traces of his ideology
 as far as Yugoslavia is concerned.  He regards him primarily as a
 Croat and a good Yugoslav.  Tito became exceedingly friendly to
 Subasic, according to his report.
 "Tito told Subasic that he is surrounded by a bunch of incompetent
 persons who, although good communists at heart, know very little
 about how to handle affairs of state.  He complained to him time
 and again of the troubles they cause him by their ignorance and
 incompetence.  Said Tito, `You, Subasic, can be of the greatest
 assistance to me and Yugoslavia.  You can handle delicately and
 tactfully our relations with the western democracies and America.
 It is too bad that we are both Croats but we shall manage and make
 Yugoslavia in the future a happy democratic state.'
 "The Prime Minister related to me that when he was brought by
 Major General Velebit to Yugoslavia., it was to Vrsac where Tito's
 headquarters were located that he was escorted.  The General left
 him in the hall where he waited for fifteen minutes and when Tito

 came out he turned to Velebit in great rage and said, `My instruc-
 tions were not to bring the Prime Minister to me.  You always mix
 things up.  You know that I wanted to come and greet the Prime
 Minister at his villa instead of him coming to me.' The Prime Min-
 ister cited to me that incident as an example of the respect with
 which Tito is treating him.  He said that it was at Tito's request
 that he saw Stalin.  He stated that it was exceedingly important
 for him to meet with Stalin and discuss with him in detail the state
 of affairs of Yugoslavia and therefore he took the trip at Tito's request.
 "Another incident related to me by Subasic as proof of Tito's trust
 in him was that the Prime Minister suggested to appoint Dr. Ante
 Pavelic, formerly his secretary in New York, as Counsel General
 and perhaps Minister in South Africa.  Subasic told Tito that of
 course it was a bit embarrassing to appoint Dr. Pavelic to that post
 because he bears the very same name as the Croatian quisling.  Tito,
 however, dismissed that obstacle saying, `What difference does it
 make what his name is.  If you find him reliable I shall appoint
 him as Minister to South Africa when I become Prime Minister.'
 11
 . Tito begged the Prime Minister to accept the portfolio of
 Minister of Foreign Affairs.  According to the Prime Minister, Tito
 assured him that he will give him complete freedom of action and will
 be guided entirely in the field of foreign policy by Subasic's sugges-
 tions and ideas.  Tito told the Prime Minister that he is contemplat-
 ing to cultivate the close cooperation of the western democracies and
 America.
 "Prime Minister related to me further that Tito, although he will
 never pursue a policy against the interest of Russia, will nevertheless
 attempt his utmost to build up a closer economic and diplomatic
 relationship between Yugoslavia and Great Britain and the United
 States.
 "The Prime Minister told me that Tito was distressed a couple of
 weeks ago when he received a letter from Churchill, couched in the
 sharpest language he has ever received from Churchill.  Subasic
 told me that he personally saw that letter and gave me the following
 account of same:
 "It seems that Churchill recently sent a request to Tito for permis-
 sion to land several divisions of Anglo-American troops in western

 Croatia along the Dalmatia coast.  Tito refused categorically to permit
 Anglo-American troops to land in Croatia.  Thereafter Churchill sent
 his famous letter to Tito in which he upbraided Tito in no uncertain
 terms and told him that Allied troops can land wherever they wish if
 the military operations require it.
 "Tito, according to Subasic, was terribly shaken up and distraught
 over the message and took the point of view that he would not give
 in to Churchill because he was fearful, as he stated to Subasic, that
 the Croatian separatists and all elements in Croatia who are against
 Tito, would seize upon the opportunity to separate from. Yugoslavia.
 Tito was very nervous that the presence of Allied troops in Croatia
 and Dalmatia would jeopardize his position and would afford the
 Croatian nationalistic elements an opportunity to rally against the
 National Committee of Liberation.
 "Subasic told me confidentially that he shared entirely Tito's point
 of view.  He told me that he knows only too well that the Vatican is
 trying to organize a federation of Catholic states into which Croatia
 should be included and that he favors Tito's feeling that Croatian
 separatists would avail themselves of the opportunity when the Allied
 troops landed in Yugoslavia to march against the Partisans.
 "Subasic told me that Churchill was exceedingly nervous and
 jittery when he left for Moscow but that he, Subasic, could see no
 other way and hopes to pacify Churchill when he sees him.  He will
 try to explain to him that he did it for one reason only: to come to an
 agreement with Tito and that he needed Stalin's backing in dealing
 with the members of the National Committee of Liberation.
 "In relating his story yesterday, Dr. Subasic told me that at the
 very beginning Stalin opened the conversation saying, 'You under-
 stand, Ivan Oissipovic, (addressing him in Slavic style;, calling him
 by his first name and the first name of his father) that Churchill and
 I have agreed to work out our arrangement on Yugoslavia on a fifty-
 fifty basis.'                                                                                                      He said Stalin was very cautious with him when they
 spoke about diplomatic matters, but again, the Prime Minister reiter-
 ated, Stalin warned him not to try to emulate Soviet Russia.  Stalin
 allegedly said, `You have not the territory of Russia nor the people of
 Russia.  You are a small country of small landowners in the heart
 of Europe.  You will have to build your state upon democratic prin-
 ciples with equal representation for all the national groups of Yugo-

 slavia.  You will have to seek economic assistance from America the
 way we here in Russia are planning to do after the war is over.'
 Stalin, according to Subasic, spoke in `very warm terms about the
 United States.'
 "Discussing the monarchy, Stalin wanted to know from Subasic
 what the people's feelings are about King Peter, II.  Subasic confided
 in me for the first time that the King is not popular in Croatia,
 Macedonia and Slovenia but that he has some following, of course, in
 Serbia, and that he told this to Stalin.  Stalin replied that he does
 not care whether there is a monarchy or a republican form of gov-
 ernment but no one should force the people to accept a monarchy
 if they do not wish it.
 "Upon returning to Yugoslavia from Moscow, Subasic told me that
 his prestige went up tremendously in Yugoslavia.  The members of
 the National Committee of Liberation who condemned him first and
 treated him like a spy and agent for the monarchy made every effort
 to cultivate his friendship.  He told me that he found an entirely
 different attitude when he returned to Yugoslavia.  That was one
 reason why he is glad that he took the trip to see Stalin.  .. .
 "Talking further to me about King Peter, Subasic confided in me
 in no uncertain terms that he regards King Peter's chances to return
 to Yugoslavia as absolutely nil.  He said that he is convinced that
 King Peter will never return but added, `Why should I destroy his
 hopes.'
 11
 .. . Subasic told me as a deep secret that there are several
 Partisan divisions at the Dalmatian coastline and that if the British
 troops should land in Yugoslavia along the Dalmatian coast they will
 meet with a formidable resistance on the part of the Partisans.  He
 said that he hopes Churchill will not repeat the mistake in Yugo-
 slavia that he made in Athens......

 and Marshall Tito's Partisan administration.  The letter to Churchill
 [rejecting the proposals concerning a regency and the delegation of
 legislative powers to the Partisan Anti-Fascist Council] was to be
 delivered on the morning of 11 January.  At 1200 noon on 11 January

 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 The OSS representative in London has transmitted the following
 information:
 In a recent conference with the OSS representative, Premier
 Subasich summarized his conference of 8 January with Prime Minister
 Churchill.  .. .
 According to Subasich, Churchill declared: "I do not like this agree-
 ment.  It appears to set up a dictatorship by Tito, who has the army
 under his control.  But I do not see any other way to solve the prob-
 lem and I shall advise the King to sign the agreement."  Churchill
 further pointed out that the agreement does not provide for the free
 functioning of other political parties [than those included in the
 Partisan movement] and emphasized that the members of the Avnoj
 [the Partisan Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation] are not
 elected representatives of the people.  Subasich replied that he is
 contemplating the possibility of broadening the Avnoj by inclusion
 of former parliamentarians now in Yugoslavia.
 In conversation with the OSS representative, Subasich complained
 of not having seen King Peter for three weeks.  He expressed con-
 cern over the "unfounded fears" of Britain and the United States that
 a Communist dictatorship will be installed in Yugoslavia, adding that
 the people of Yugoslavia want only a democracy and will insist on this
 form of government.  Even Stalin himself, said Subasich, does not
 wish a Communist regime in Yugoslavia.  Finally, Subasich expressed
 his hope that "the King will himself grant concessions rather than
 have them taken by the masses themselves."

 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 The following information has been transmitted by the OSS repre-

 On 27 January, Ambassador Stevenson handed Subasich a written
 communication from the British Foreign Office, stating that the Foreign
 Office had received a telegram from Stalin with reference to Churchill's
 speech of 16 January.  The telegram expressed Stalin's opinion that
 the Yugoslav Government should depart at once for Belgrade and fuse
 with the Tito government, which would then name a Regency.
 Churchill replied to this telegram that he wanted United States con-
 sent, which had not yet been received.
 In spite of this information, the Yugoslav Cabinet again expressed
 itself as unanimously opposed to leaving London until a settlement
 had been reached with King Peter.  Peter is still holding firmly to
 his position, but desires help "in defense of the people's liberties."
 Partisan General Velebit is conferring with leaders of the progressive
 democratic parties.  Subasich is in a state of physical collapse and
 has begged the King for two days rest.

 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 The OSS representative in London has transmitted the following

 Premier Subasich has stated that the entire Yugoslav Cabinet will

 King Peter.  The King's nominations for the Regency, Milan Grol,
 Yuray Shutay (Sutej), and Dushan Sernets (Sernec), will be sub-

 able, but that Tito's subordinates are more difficult. Many of the
 latter, Subasich explains, have had little opportunity to learn about
 the United States or Britain, and hence underrate their importance.
 Subasich said he would endeavor to carry out King Peter's instruc-
 tions concerning the regency council, but if this should be impossible
 and the King should refuse to ratify the counterproposals of Tito and
 Subasich, the result would be "very bad."  Subasich would not say
 whether, in such case, he would proceed without the King's approval,
 but stated that he definitely would not return to London.
 Ed.vard Kardely, Vice President of the National Liberation Com-
 mittee (the Partisan provisional cabinet) and one of the leading nego-
 tiators, asserted on 22 February that the basic conflict between the
 King and Tito is due to the fact that the King insists on nominating
 politically prominent men to the regency, while Tito feels the regents
 should exercise only the royal prerogatives and should be non-political
 figures  "Otherwise," added Kardely, "we would have a regency fol-
 '.(owing one political line while we would be following another."  This,
 said Kardely, was Tito's reason for rejecting Milan Grol and Yuray
 Shutey (Sutej), the latter of whom is unacceptable to the Partisans
 for other reasons as well.  . . .
 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 The following information has been transmitted by the OSS repre-
 sentatiive in Belgrade:
 In Serbia there is reported to be considerable dissatisfaction with
 the lack of a genuine Serb in the newly appointed Yugoslav regency
 council.  [Srdjan Budisavlyevich is a Serb from Croatia, who is be-
 lieved to have little or no following in Serbia.]  The disappointment
 of anti-Partisan Serbs has contributed to a general feeling of despair
 among those Yugoslavs who had hoped that Subasich would exercise
 a restraining influence on the Partisans.  General Alexander's visit
 to Belgrade also contributed to this feeling.  At first the opposition
 interpreted Alexander's arrival as a sign of Allied pressure on Tito.
 When the General's convoy of fifty jeeps entered Belgrade, rumors
 quickly spread that this was the vanguard of an Allied armored corps,
 and. Alexander himself was greeted by spontaneous demonstrations.
 The opposition's hopes were soon dashed, however, by the realization
 that the Western Allies were not prepared to rescue them from their
 predicament.  In this atmosphere the announcement of the regency,
 while relieving the uncertainty of past weeks, has produced little evi-
 dence of the general rejoicing reported in Belgrade by the BBC.

 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 I attach summary and conclusions of a report from Lt. Col. Charles
 Thayer, who is in charge of our mission in Yugoslavia.
 15 April 1945
 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
 .... Aside from the restoration of essential services, Tito has made
 little progress in solving his economic problems. What steps he has
 taken are toward a centralized state-directed economy which under
 an inexperienced bureaucracy have not improved a bad situation.  .. .
 Although Tito has continued to assert that democracy and freedom
 are his ultimate aims, his methods have in reality been completely
 dictatorial, and the system of control he has imposed on the country
 has been in effect no less thorough and rigorous than those of the
 German dominated puppet regimes that preceded him.
 Under the guise of military necessity, a censorship has been enforced
 that permits of no criticism either in the press or in public utterances.
 Active non-conformists are arrested and imprisoned until they can
 satisfy Tito's followers that they are no longer dangerous.
 The Yalta recommendation to broaden the base of the supreme
 legislative organ by including uncompromised members of the last
 parliament is being carried out by a committee composed exclusively
 of veteran Partisans and dominated by the Communists who may be
 expected to apply strict standards, peculiarly their own in determining
 the eligibility of former Yugoslav politicians to participate in the
 future political life of the country.
 Similarly, if past performance is any guide, future elections will be
 dominated by the National Liberation Front which heretofore has in
 practice had the exclusive right of nominating candidates in local
 elections.  The Front, together with its affiliated organizations among

 the youth and the women has already managed to penetrate every
 city ward, every block, and practically every house.  Similarly, every
 office and factory has its political organizers who are establishing a
 disciplined control over the workers.
 In addition he has organized a political police force and an espionage
 system recruited from his most loyal followers, who, with fanatical
 zeal seek out their internal enemies and dispose of them with little
 regard for those legal rights which form the basis of a genuine demo-
 cratic government.  .. .
 In foreign affairs, as in internal affairs, Russia is the lodestone gov-
 erning Tito's policies.  In every international issue, whether it is the
 direct concern of Yugoslavia or not, Tito and his press assiduously
 follow Moscow's lead. In fact, Tito and his followers exhibit a servility
 toward the Kremlin which contrasts strangely with their otherwise
 dynamic individuality.  It is enough for Moscow to express a view
 and the Belgrade press reprints it in toto, adding a few biting words
 of its own.  Under these circumstances it is no small wonder that in
 Belgrade one finds no evidence of a corps of Russian agents directing
 the activities of individual ministries or agencies.  Should the necessity
 arise for specific guidance, no doubt a brief message from Stalin to
 Tito would suffice.  .. .

 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 The following message came in yesterday from our representative
 in Belgrade:
 "Yesterday morning Air Vice Marshall Lee and myself were sum-
 moned to the office of Arso Jovanovic, Chief of Staff for Tito.  He
 advised us curtly that Tito had ordered our missions to leave, including
 both the Belgrade mission and those in the field.  He stated that our
 work should be taken over by the Military Attaches.  Obviously this
 is in retaliation for our strong stand on Trieste and Corinthia.  I made
 no commitment to him on time of withdrawal, and I do not intend to
 hurry.  Lee stated that he presumed the Yugoslav missions in Cairo,
 Rome and Bari would be withdrawn.  Arso obviously had not thought
 of this but was forced to say yes.
 As he had no word of appreciation for the missions, I reviewed for
 him what the missions had done for Yugoslavia in bringing recogni-

 tion to the Partisans and in providing material aid.  He replied that
 the Partisans would have won with or without our support and that
 the materials we provided were their right to receive.  He then
 launched into a tirade about who occupied Trieste and Venezia
 Giulia first."
 16 June 1945
 I believe you will be interested in the following dispatch which
 we have received from our representative at Caserta:
 "1. Following memorandum reported to have been distributed to
 all Jugoslav Army Officers: `It has been seen in the past that Jugo-
 slavian officers do not mix with the officers of the USSR and we wish
 to have greater brotherhood between the officers of these two coun-
 tries.  Do not be afraid to talk of military information and army
 movements to the Russian officers are to be considered as instructors
 and brothers and our only allies.7  (Signed Tito).'

 OSS representatives in Rome, Madrid and Kunming have trans-
 mitted the following information, as of 1 September, concerning under-
 ground movements and secret intelligence activities continuing at the
 present time in the following areas:
 YUGOSLAVIA: Royal Yugoslav missions and Chetnik groups (Yugo-
 slav nationalists, some of whose leaders cooperated with the Germans)
 are operating in Italy under cover of a Yugoslav welfare society which
 recently established a new branch in Milan.  Under the leadership
 of Zhivko Topalovich (President of Mihailovich's anti-Partisan "Na-
 tional Committee") energetic steps are being taken to unite numerous
 Serb, Croat and Slovene anti-Tito groups into one so-called "demo-
 cratic bloc."  Detention and refugee camps for Yugoslavs in Italy
 are being combed for recruits to this new organization.  Late in
 August the organization dispatched a Chetnik agent to renew contact
 with clandestine anti-Partisan groups in Yugoslavia.  .. . .

 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 The following information, bearing on the Yugoslav elections sched-
 uled for 11 November, has been transmitted by the OSS representative
 in Belgrade and is dated 10, 11 and 12 September:
 Partisan Attitude.  The official Partisan attitude toward the elec-
 tions was outlined by Lieutenant General Milovan Djilas, Minister
 of State for Montenegro in the Tito cabinet and an influential member
 of the Partisan Liberation Front, in a recent speech to a plenary
 assembly of the (Partisan) Anti-Fascist Youth Organization.  Djilas
 stated: "Our enemies at home and the foreign reactionaries who are
 helping them regard these elections as if they were to decide the
 destiny of Democratic Federative Yugoslavia.  The leaders of the
 National Liberation struggle, however, do not consider the elections
 to involve any question of the survival of the National Liberation
 Front.  . ..  We consider the question of our national government
 actually to have been decided by our armed struggle.  These elec-
 tions by the peoples of Yugoslavia should only endow the results of
 our struggle with legality and constitutionality.  We consider the
 question of monarchy versus republic to have been settled by our
 struggle.  It has not been formally settled, as far as the final legaliza-
 tion of the form of government in Yugoslavia is concerned, but in
 actual practice it is already decided.  What then is the purpose of
 these elections?  Their purpose is to enable us "to continue along the
 lines of the national liberation struggle."  . . .
 Precept from Poor Richard.
 One of the most egregious penetrations in the history of espionage
 was the British agent Edward Bancroft, who made himself invaluable
 to Benjamin Franklin as private secretary when Franklin was the
 American envoy in Paris working to get French aid for the revolu-
 tion.1  Franklin has been called a dupe and stubborn fool for ignoring
 repeated warnings about this man, who was not conclusively exposed
 until a collection of British secret service papers was published more
 than a century later.  On the following pages, however, is reproduced
 a letter from Franklin acknowledging a similar warning,z,which shows
 the attitude he took toward the security of his secretariat.  It is also
 a classic contribution to doctrine for general application.

 THE NEW MEANING OF TREASON.  By Rebecca Wes.  (Nev
 York: Viking.  1964.  374 pp.  $6.95.)
 TREASON IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY.  By Margaret Boveri
 Translated from the German (Hamburg, 1956) by Jonathan Stein
 berg.*  (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons.  1963.  370 pp. $5.95.'
 These two books cover roughly the same subject ;matter-treason
 and espionage in World War II and the postwar period.  Both are
 thoughtful and scholarly and obviously required a great deal of re
 search, which on the whole appears to have been most carefully done
 Both try through detailed and extensive analyses of episodes the,
 class as treachery to evolve a thesis of philosophical concepts whic
 have general application, and here I believe both fail.
 In her earlier book on The Meaning of Treason (1947) Miss Wes
 presented a good deal of the same material but came to a quite differ
 ent conclusion.  In effect, she said that the high development o
 modern civilization impairs the relationship between the citizen an(
 the state and that loyalty to country is no longer the simple an(
 clear-cut bond it once was.  Now she has expanded and updated he
 discussion of William Joyce, the wartime Lord Haw-Haw of Radi
 Berlin, and added more recent cases, notably those involving Burges
 and Maclean, Vassall, Abel, the Rosenbergs, and Profurno, layin;
 particular emphasis on the security aspects; and she concludes tha
 in today's world there is a pervasive and expanding espionage effor
 met by an equally widespread and expanding counterespionage effort
 While recognizing the national need for security, she dwells at som
 length on the dangers that security and countersecurity activity pose
 to our societies and warns us to balance security requirements with
 determination to preserve our liberties.
 The German author, Miss Boveri, argues a change in the nature c
 loyalties since the days of feudalism, pointing out that with th
 French Revolution the simple allegiance of vassal to lord began t
 break down and be replaced by the more complicated obligation
 of a citizen in the developing democratic states.  As an example c

 the feudal practice she notes the soldier's oath required by the King
 of Prussia as late as 1831.  Clearly inconsistent with this thesis
 is her own observation that the oath of personal loyalty which Hitler
 required of all German officers was one of the main inhibitions to
 their active participation in the 20 July 1944 plot against him.
 In developing her thesis Miss Boveri uses a remarkable collection
 of examples.  One of the first is Vidkun Quisling, who incidentally
 bears a strong resemblance to William Joyce.  He is followed by such
 figures as King Leopold of Belgium, Marshal Petain, Admiral Darlan,
 and Laval.  She then mixes in Joyce, Ezra Pound, Tokyo Rose, and
 Knut Hamsun.  Next she treats at length the opposition to Hitler by
 the various German groups from the old conservatives like General
 Beck through the curious combination of people involved in "Rote
 Kapelle" and on to Stauffenberg.  Finally she mentions rather briefly
 such cases as those of Rudolf Rossler (the "Lucy" of Alexander
 Foote's net) and Otto John.
 She claims to be able to see a common thread running through all
 these diverse types, but I find the argument unconvincing.  It is
 difficult to see the tie between a despicable William Joyce and
 Stauffenberg, or between the patriot Rossler and Ezra Pound. More
 generally, espionage cases like that of Colonel Abel cannot be classed
 as treason.  The detailed studies of all these people in both books
 seem to me to be not susceptible of the authors' interpretations but
 rather to lead to the conclusion that
 The wrong is mixed.  In tragic life, God wot,
 No villain need bel  Passions spin the plot:
 We are betrayed by what is false within.'
 Another book on Lord Haw-Haw appeared in 1964, written by
 J. A. Cole.2  It covers the same ground Miss West did and expands
 particularly on Joyce's activities in Germany and his personal life.
 (Curiously, it does not credit or even refer to her work, although some
 of its passages are so like hers as to suggest familiarity with it.)  Is
 William Joyce worth all this effort?  Perhaps the British, on whom
 his broadcasts had such an impact during the war, find the subject
 fascinating; but for me, well written as these books are, they do not
 make a major figure out of him.  Both authors show a surprising

 RED PAWN: The Story of Noel Field.  By Flora Lewis.,  (New
 York: Doubleday.  1965.  283 pp.  $4.95.)
 In 1949 three American citizens disappeared behind the iron cur-
 tain-Noel Field, his wife Herta, and his brother Hermann.                                                                                                                    A year
 later his foster daughter Erika Wallach bravely went to Communist
 headquarters in East Berlin looking for him; she was arrested and
 disappeared too.  In 1954 Noel and Herta were released in Buda-
 pest and chose to remain there.  Hermann was released in Warsaw
 and hurried back to the United States.  Erika Wallach was released
 in Moscow and, not having U.S. citizenship, was finally permitted to
 join her American husband and children here only after Congressman
 Francis Walters had intervened on her behalf.
 Noel, Herta, and Erika were all avowed Communists.  Hermann
 was not.  Their arrests, tortured interrogations, and lengthy stays in
 prison played a part-perhaps a key part-in the extensive purges
 of the late Stalin period.  The incredibly complex story of their case,
 and of the era, is told in Red Pawn.
 Pawn, dupe, or something more sinister, Noel Field became a touch-
 stone in most of the East European purge trials in the early fifties-
 those of Rajk and his associates in Hungary, of Gomulka in Poland,
 of Slansky in Czechoslovakia, others in East Germany.  Flora Lewis-
 Mrs. Sydney Gruson in private life-estimates that the number of
 people involved in these purges who had some association, direct or
 indirect, with Noel Field may run into the tens or even hundreds of
 thousands.  Many were executed, committed suicide, died in prison,
 or just disappeared.  All spent long periods in prison, under torture,
 or in work camps in the Soviet Union; the whole thing was a Soviet
 show.  After Stalin and Beria died, and particularly after Khru-
 shchev's revelations at the Twentieth Congress concerning Stalinist
 excesses, a great number of the victims were released and rehabilitated.
 Some got a posthumous rehabilitation, undoubtedly significant in the
 Red Valhalla.
 An unhappy central figure in this web, Noel Field was born in

 Gated at Harvard.  He was a U.S. Foreign Service employee until
 the mid-thirties, when he resigned and went to work for the League
 of Nations Secretariat in Geneva: although a Communist, he is sup-
 posed to have had scruples about spying on his own country from
 his State Department job.  This itself is a tip-off as to how good a
 Communist he was, and the Communists in fact never accepted him.
 All of his many and persistent approaches to leaders to obtain some
 important assignment were rejected.
 Field was unquestionably of service to the Communists in the
 period that began during the Spanish Civil War and continued until
 after the end of World War If.  Working with the Unitarian Service
 Committee, his humanitarian efforts were directed toward getting
 preferred treatment for the Communists.  During this period he also
 made the contact with Allen Dulles in Switzerland that was later used
 as evidence of his being an American intelligence agent to justify the
 liquidation of many of his Communist contacts.  (Dulles made cau-
 tious use of him, considering him neither trustworthy nor a real
 intelligence operator.)
 Flora Lewis has unearthed an impressive amount of information
 for this book, considering her difficulties with sources.  Noel and
 Ilerta Field refused to talk to her.  The OSS and CIA files were not
 available to her.  (Assuming that the data in these would be ex-
 clusively historical, she expresses concern over this secrecy.)  Erika
 Glaser Wallach and Hermann Field undoubtedly told her all they
 knew.  But she must be given credit for having tracked down thou-
 sands of leads to persons living and dead.
 Perhaps because of this lack of access to some files, the author
 has left one or two erroneous impressions.  She overstresses the as-
 sistance OSS gave to the Communists during the war, neglecting the
 fact that the Soviet Union was an ally of the United States in the
 common effort against Nazi Germany.  She also seems to place Noel
 Field on an undeserved pedestal-possibly because material on his
 activities remained thin despite her arduous research-when basically
 he was a rather stupid idealist who never held an important post in
 his life.

 is the raid that was made on the French channel port of Dieppe on
 August 19, 1942.
 Dieppe has been described as a reconnaissance in force.  It was
 actually a test battle staged to learn the strength of the German
 defenses around a typical channel port.  The British General Staff
 felt that a landing in near-division strength should be undertaken
 in preparation for the invasion of Europe.  The Canadians, because
 they had been training in England since 1939, were selected to provide
 the bulk of the ground forces.
 The action developed into five separate ground fights, an air battle,
 and a sea skirmish.  Three of the landings were disasters, those on
 the main beaches at Dieppe and the two flanking ports at Puits and
 Pourville.  The two successful assaults were on the extreme :flanks:
 the 4th Commando destroyed a German battery at Varengeville and
 the remnants of the 3rd Commando neutralized the guns at Berneval.
 But the slaughter on the beaches made Dieppe one of the most costly
 actions of the war.
 The reporting on the battle at the time was distorted in nearly the
 entire Allied press.  British papers called it a Commando raid and
 touted the RAF action as a major air victory (RAF losses 113,
 Luftwaffe 40).  The American press played up American participa-
 tion out of all proportion (50 Rangers among more than 6,000 ground
 troops).  The Canadian reports, coming closest to the truth, saw it as
 a bloody catastrophe (3,369 Canadian casualties).
 This is the first book-length description of the action at Dieppe
 for the Canadian audience.  Of the three previous book-length treat-
 ments one was published in France and two in England.  The official
 Canadian history of the war by Stacey devoted only about a hundred
 pages to the battle which Canada has more reasons to remember
 than any other single action; more Canadians were taken prisoner at
 Dieppe than in the entire balance of the European campaign.

 Robertson has done an excellent research job, though obviously
 swayed heavily by the emotions which the battle still arouses in
 Canada.  His book is full of personal anecdotes; he has probably
 interviewed just about every survivor in Canada.  He pays great at-
 tention to the validity of prior intelligence, both British and German,
 but he neglects some very important items.  If he had treated the
 whole action more as an intelligence exercise, stressing the great
 value that what was learned at Dieppe assumed nearly two years later
 on, D Day in Normandy, his book would have been not only more
 perceptive history but perhaps of more solace to the Canadians.

 A TASTE OF FREEDOM.  By Robert Jackson.  (London: Arthur
 Barker.  1964.  207 pp.  21/-.)
 No German or Italian prisoner of war who escaped from custody in
 England succeeded in making the home run to the continent while
 World War II was still in progress.  A Taste of Freedom is a roundup
 of the frustrations of several men who tried.  Some of their tales
 have been told in books and articles (for example that of von Werra),
 but a few are published here for the first time. Noteworthy among
 these is that of Luftwaffe pilots Wappler and Schnabel, who escaped
 from a prison near Carlisle, stole a training aircraft from Kingstown
 airfield, and flew eastward,  Short of fuel and uncertain of their loca-
 tion, the Germans put down at a RAF field, where, incredibly, they
 'were able to refuel and take to the air again without causing alarm.
 The end came when they again ran short of fuel and were forced to
 land in a meadow in southeastern England, some 120 miles from
 German-held France.  With slightly better flying weather this daring
 attempt might well have succeeded.
 Although not intended as a survey of life in prisoner-of-war camps
 in Britain, the book includes considerable background on the schemes
 and aberrations of unrepentant Nazis who carried on in the prison
 camps from where they had left off in Germany.

 I CAN TELL IT NOW.  Edited by David Brown and W. Richard
 Bruner.  (New York: E. P. Dutton.  1964.  362 pp.  $5.95,)
 This is a collection of almost two score past news stories, some
 hitherto untold, which stood out in the recollections of the contributors,
 members of the Overseas Press Club.  Several of them touch, not
 sensationally, on intelligence interests.
 Drew Middleton recalls bow widely the Nazi invasion of the USSR,
 21 June 1941, was foreknown not only in intelligence circles but to
 the public, to "everyone but Stalin." Middleton first heard in March
 from a British intelligence officer in Lisbon that the German plan
 called for the attack that spring.  In May the word in Lisbon was
 that it had been delayed by the unexpected Balkan campaign (as
 indeed it had) but would take place about 20 June.  In the first week
 of June Anthony Eden told correspondents that 120 divisions were
 deployed along the Soviet frontier and would move in sometime during
 the last half of the month.  Middleton, paying tribute to British in-
 telligence for getting this information, says, "Soviet intelligence must
 have known of Hitler's build-up"; he apparently hasn't heard of Serge's
 warning to Moscow.
 Sigrid Schultz reports, not very credibly, end-of-war conversations
 with Germans which revealed the Germans' intent to play the Rus-
 sians and the Western capitalists off against each other as they had
 after World War I.  One "carefully planned move" to this end was
 to preserve the Reich intelligence files on the United States and turn
 them over to the Russians, while on the other hand "Gehlen and his
 friends managed to put over a deal with the Americans by using his
 ample files [on the USSR] as bait.  Germans boast .... that we al-
 lowed him to set up his own `Gehlen outfit' that retained its files, sent
 out its own agents, and handed over to the Americans only what
 Gehlen himself considered suitable while we were footing the bill
 for all these operations."
 Bob Considine tells the story of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg's espio-
 nage activity and trial and ends with a gruesomely detailed eye-witness
 account of their electrocution, hers bungled and prolonged.
 Four of the selections are centered on Communist leaders.  Harrison
 Salisbury relives the mysterious apprehension in the Moscow atmos-
 phere culminating in the announcement on 13 January 1953 about the

 Doctors' Plot and then the "frozen terror" that reigned until Stalin's
 death two months later.  William L. Ryan, taking off from his
 recollections of Soviet leaders' indiscretions at an October Revolution
 banquet in 1953 which Khrushchev did not attend, reviews the former
 Premier's career.  Jules Dubois writes about Castro's coming to power;
 he begins by quoting "Dick" Rubottom on the question whether Fidel
 was a Communist: "Every week we had a high-level meeting with all
 intelligence agencies in Washington and I always asked for such in-
 formation and always received a negative reply."  And Martin A.
 Bursten, with dubious authority, portrays Janos Kadar as a eunuch
 whose sole aim in life has been to survive.
 Jules Bergman tells "The Unfinished Saga of the U-2," emphasizing
 not the political embarrassment of the Powers shoot-down but the
 compelling need there was for reconnaissance, the answer in "one of
 the most astounding demonstrations of intelligence work in modern
 history," the "colossal" value of the photographic take, and the role
 of the U-2 as forerunner of the A-l1 and spy-in-the-sky satellites.
 Edward Hymoff reviews his own past coverage of the U.S. and Soviet
 space-flight programs.  Although he complains that "the United States
 has been just as . . . secretive as the Soviets," he has managed to
 get hold of a number of secrets, including the fact that U.S. radar sta-
 tions in Turkey monitoring Soviet missile launchings are huge installa-
 tions with some "screens"-he must mean antennas-"as long as foot-
 ball fields."
 Daniel G. Van Acken writes about the Cuban missile crisis, less from
 the intelligence angle than from the viewpoint of the UN and with
 gratitude that "enough men . . . took time out to think."  And Jess
 Corkin, Parade editor, tells how he spent almost two years promoting
 a hot line to Moscow, winning approval from Eisenhower, Nixon,
 ]Kennedy, and Khrushchev but no action, before that crisis lent suf-
 ficient impetus to the idea.
 TIE STRATEGY OF SUBVERSION.  By Paul W. Blackstock.  (Chi-
 cago: Quadrangle.  1964.  351 pp.                $7.50.)
 This is a political scientist's study of covert political (including para-
 military) operations as an instrument of state policy.  It inquires into
 their effectiveness and liabilities and dwells on some persistent prob-
 lems in managing and controlling them.  As empirical base for his
 MORI/HRP PAGES 96-98                      Approved
 analysis and conclusions the author uses three chief examples--some
 Tsarist operations in the nineteenth century, Nazi German prewar and
 wartime efforts, and at greatest length CIA's publicized activities,
 centering on the failure at the Bay of Pigs.
 Although he promises the reader that he will keep his attention
 on political principles and avoid both U.S. policy recommendations
 and scapegoating of U.S. agencies, this choice of evidential base in-
 evitably leaves CIA the villain of his book, especially since he dis-
 counts the most authoritative accounts of the Bay of Pigs crisis as
 CIA-inspired special pleading, quotes approvingly the arguments for a
 congressional watchdog committee, and reverts again and again to
 Truman's astonishing repudiation of CIA's operational responsibilities.
 Ile also steps down from the plane of principle in suggesting that the
 FBI rather than CIA should help small nations develop their security
 organs, in declaring that the Pentagon has a "far more sophisticated"
 counterinsurgency doctrine, and in blaming CIA for not being a silent
 service like the British.
 The reader comes to suspect, in fact, that the professor is less in-
 terested in producing a work of scholarship than in cashing in on the
 public interest which made best sellers of two recent journalistic books
 on CIA operations.  Although his foreword deprecates such "well-
 meaning but only partially informed criticism" as "alarmist literature,"
 his text proper immediately reverses field and begins to quote these
 books respectfully as his authority.  This impression of duplicity, of a
 facade of objective scholarship over a pandering to sensationalism, is
 reinforced by his remarkable act of false coyness during an interview
 reported in the Philadelphia Bulletin of 17 January last.  .Asked
 whether he had ever served with CIA-he hadn't, but in an Army
 Special Warfare office-"'It is not in my record,' he replied cau-
 tiously-and grinned.  That was all I could get from him on the
 subject."
 On the political science level Blackstock generalizes in conclusion
 that among the major world powers covert operations have been over-
 sold, are undermined by bureaucratic rivalry over control of them,
 introduce distortions into intelligence, interfere in policy making, and
 embarrass international relations.  Large-scale operations risk spark-
 ing a thermonuclear conflagration, and the techniques taught to un-
 developed nations foment strife and disorder.  Nevertheless he does
 not urge that they be altogether abandoned but only insists that "the

 veil of secrecy must be lifted"-he doesn't explain how this fits in
 with his admiration for the "silent service" of the British-so that they
 can be employed, presumably under the guidance of the political sci-
 entists, "with an understanding of the principles involved."

 Shortcomings and net usefulness of
 a sharply policy-pointed class of esti-
 mative exercise.
 ON ESTIMATING REACTIONS
 John Whitman
 The most fascinating and frustrating of the National Intelligence
 Estimates which an estimates officer writes begin as follows:
 THE PROBLEM
 To estimate Communist reactions to a U.S. course of action involv-
 ing ...
 These estimates form a quite distinct category.  They originate
 in a unique way; they pose special problems of organization; their
 coordination with the representatives of the USIB member agencies
 is exceptionally difficult; and final USIB approval almost always re-
 quires more than one meeting, often more than two.  Herein reside
 the frustrations, to which I shall devote the greater part of what
 follows.  The fascination lies in the assurance that the drafter is
 involved in major and immediate decisions of U.S. policy. No other
 estimates can generate in his breast quite such a sharp sense of
 relevance to action.
 These papers are often miscalled "contingency estimates."  Con-
 tingencies figure in almost all NIEs.  Sometimes they concern what
 one foreign country may do if a neighbor takes certain steps, e.g.,
 what Pakistan will do if India embarks on a nuclear weapons program.
 Sometimes a contingency lying in possible U.S. action is examined
 as part of a wider study, e.g., in the course of a genera] estimate
 on South Korea, ROK reactions to a reduction of U.S. military aid
 may be explored.  To avoid confusion with these, it will be useful to
 reserve the term "reaction estimates" for those NIEs which are ad-
 dressed exclusively to the question of other countries'--usually Com-
 munist powers'-responses to a postulated U.S. course of action in
 a crisis situation.
 Origination
 Reaction estimates are never self-initiated.  They are commissioned
 by policy-making departments which are considering taking some

 specific course of action and want an appraisal of how the enemy
 will probably respond.  They are invariably written against short
 deadlines and deal with immediately critical problems. Those of
 the last few years have dealt principally with three situations-
 Berlin, Laos, and Vietnam.  The first were requested by the Berlin
 Task Force in the State Department; the father of the other two sets
 is an alumnus of the Office of National Estimates who migrated to
 policy-making posts and established a practice-now sustained by
 the White House, the Joint Chiefs, and others-of subjecting a great
 variety of Indochina policy proposals to the estimative test.
 After writing quite a number of reaction estimates, I'm still not
 entirely sure why requesters keep on asking for them.  The results,
 as we shall see, are often of dubious value.  Sometimes I suspect
 that the commissions come from opponents of the policy proposal
 who hope that the estimators will help them kill it.  But the process
 does reflect a fundamental principle of intelligence: that when early
 enemy reactions are the critical test of a policy proposal, these reactions
 should be estimated in advance, not by proponents or opponents, but
 by someone uninvolved in the heat of policy contention.  Full ob-
 jectivity is of course a counsel of perfection, but I think it correct,
 not merely charitable, to say that the policy makers should and do
 feel better-feel protected against the full force of bias-when they
 have an outside opinion.  And since these matters are too sensitive
 to be submitted to public opinion, they turn to intelligence as an
 inside outsider.
 Terms of Reference
 And intelligence always bucks.  We are never satisfied with the
 way the questions are put.  They are far too general; we need a
 clearer idea of what the United States proposes to do; in particular
 we need sharper distinctions among the various steps to be taken in
 a sequence.  Very well, responds the policy maker, and lists for us
 four major steps and a dozen specific actions within each, including
 inter al'ia, say, the exact inventory of implements to be used in each
 of three probes on the Berlin autobahn.  Now we are really out-
 raged.  Perhaps, we say, we can provide some general guidance, but
 how do you expect us to distinguish between reactions on the one
 hand to ten air sorties against troop concentrations in Laos with high
 Approved For Release 2005/01/05
 SECRET
 explosives and on the other to fifteen sorties against lines of communi-
 cation with napalm?
 It would be nice to think that we eventually sort out with the
 requester the proper level of detail and can proceed to answer ques-
 tions which are governed by the limits of professional intelligence
 and human judgment.  Unfortunately, this is often not the case; the
 question of proper terms of reference dogs us to the very end of the
 process.  The reason, I am sorry to say, is that we are not "outside"
 after all. Each of the intelligence agencies works for a particular
 policy maker.  Even the Director of Central Intelligence is, under
 one of his hats, a senior policy advisor to the President.  And it is
 uncanny how the choice of a level of detail will influence the esti-
 mated enemy reaction, and therefore the seeming wisdom of the
 proposed policy.  A proposal may appear to bloom with fair prospects
 when viewed in a general way, yet prove to be studded with thorns
 when examined in detail.  Surely everyone can understand this; how
 many bright ideas have we all had which might survive one or at
 most two levels of detailed criticism but fell apart at the third?  And
 when that third level is reached, do we not insist that its a good
 idea "in principle" and plead for a reconsideration at the higher,
 more favorable level of generalization?
 Other Kinds of Bias
 _ That was a fairly subtle point.  A more obvious one is that the
 participating agencies may already, at their policy-making summits,
 have decided what they think about the proposed U.S. course.  Their
 intelligence arms are then under pressure, of course, to bend the
 estimate toward these conclusions. There are two barriers against
 this: the fortitude of the drafter and the chairman, and the collective
 conscience-a sense of mutual responsibility, really-which has grown
 up over the years in the estimative community.  The latter works
 surprisingly well most of the time.
 Another source of bias, again on the subtle side, lies in the fact
 that the estimators are American citizens, rooting for their country.
 If the policy proposal is not outrageously unreasonable, it is well-nigh
 impossible for us to bring ourselves to a firm estimate that the United
 States is bound to lose.  We can make differential judgments in
 which some parts of the policy look more likely than others to pro-
 duce the desired results.                                                                                                               But at some point the course of action will

 usually culminate in a sheer test of will, and how can we bring our-
 selves to estimate that we will be the first to falter?'
 But: having bared all these misgivings, I remain persuaded that the
 policy maker is better off for having solicited an estimate of enemy
 reactions from intelligence agencies which, bureaucratically tied
 though they are to policy departments, are by training and inclination
 and conscience freer from commitments to policy than he and his
 colleagues are.  And so we proceed with the drafting, knowing that
 we will have to continue solving and re-solving the terms-of-reference
 question as honestly as we can.
 The Drafting
 (Though the precepts which follow may all be golden truths, they
 are not likely to be of much help to the next estimator who has to
 draft a reaction estimate.  This poor fellow will have to read the
 request, negotiate its unclarities with some ill-informed representative
 of the requester, exchange confusions with the newly appointed chair-
 man of the estimate, and produce a first draft-all within 24 or ten
 or even six hours.  Theory is gray, Lenin remarked, but the tree of
 life is ever green. Or, as Stalin put it, cadres decide everything.)
 Through the bitter experience of many redrafts I have learned that
 it is absolutely indispensable to begin a reaction estimate with an
 analysis of the situation preceding the U.S. action proposed.  Usually,
 in fact, it is necessary to back up two steps: In many cases the U.S.
 policy presupposes an enemy initiative which then sets us into motion
 along the hypothesized line.  What, then, did he mean by this action?
 Did he expect our reaction, in which case he presumably has a pre-
 planned counter-reaction?  Or would he be taken aback by what we
 did and discover himself in the midst of some major miscalculation,
 unready with a next move and wholly uncertain about further U.S.
 intentions?  These questions make a great deal of difference.  Often
 no single answer can be given, and instead there emerge alternative
 analyses which must then be run out in parallel through the re-
 mainder of the estimate.  Well why not, you say, but I promise you
 'This irreducible element of bias probably saved us (the estimators, not the
 United States) in a series of Berlin estimates.  The USSR's local advantages
 seemed overwhelming, and it was very hard to see how various U.S. cotIrses
 of action could surmount the crisis.  Gritting our teeth, we estimated some
 even chances.  More important, the President gritted his teeth and made us right.
 that this plays hell with drafting a paper simple and intelligible
 enough to be useful.
 An ordinary NIE-on Soviet military policy, say, or the outlook
 for Brazil-has a theme, a tone.  A competent drafter will marshal
 his facts and his ideas and construct an argument which leads to a
 single or a few major conclusions.  If he does not, there's no use
 writing the estimate.  If he does, and if he constructs well, then his
 betters 2 may tug and pull at his paragraphs, alter his adjectives, and
 qualify his estimative passages, but his message still comes through.
 It is fatal to approach a reaction estimate in this fashion.  The
 drafter will encounter a long succession of close judgments ,as he
 works his way through the paper.  Most of them will be near the
 50-50 mark; if they were not, the estimate would not have been re-
 quested.  He will make some of them in one direction, others in the
 opposite. He will estimate "desirable" reactions to some U.S. moves,
 "undesirable" ones to others.  Out of the sum total of these, some
 general theme may in the end emerge, but he had better lei: this
 happen rather than aim at it.  For his paper consists essentially of
 nothing but this succession of judgments, and many of them will be
 changed before the USIB finally signs off.  If his draft is built
 around a theme, he will have to restructure, probably sooner rather
 than later.
 But he can make his contribution.  In thinking through the ques-
 tions, he can try to find the turning points, the stage or stages which
 constitute, in Alsopian language, the "crunch."  This, I think, is a
 real service.  It tells the policy maker, not what will happen, but
 what to worry most or pray hardest about.  It tells him about: the
 moment of truth-what its content will be and where, as he gropes
 along an uncertain path, he may expect to encounter it.  To do this
 well is a triumph.
 If he is lucky enough to find a turning point, the wise drafter will
 stop and point in both directions.  He will give a scrupulously com-
 plete list of arguments why the enemy might do what we want him
 to do.  Then be will give an exhaustive set of reasons why the
 enemy might do just the opposite.   This is another service.  It gets
 the policy maker to think about all the - factors, the unpleasant as
 well as the pleasant ones.  And it insures that he cannot dismiss

 the conclusion which follows on the grounds that the intelligence
 people forgot something important.
 The Result
 Once this is done, the drafter can be rather casual about which
 direction he chooses.  It doesn't much matter; the Director will make
 up his mind, some USIB members will join him in the text, and
 others will take footnotes of dissent.  But if the text has not laid the
 proper groundwork for these decisions, the drafter will have to
 endure an hour of confused argument at the USIB table and then
 start over again.
 Nor, I would maintain, should it make very much difference what
 the USIB decides.  The President surely would be silly to let his
 decision be determined by whether intelligence said the chances.
 were "slightly better than even" or "slightly worse than even."  In
 the first place, the policy proposal has probably been changed in
 two or three minor ways, just enough to render the estimate slightly
 inapplicable, when he gets it.  In the second place, the policy would
 assuredly be modified in the course of its implementation, enough to
 render the estimate more than slightly inapplicable.  In the third
 and resounding place, everyone from drafter to President knows that
 the future is plain unknowable.
 Well then, why write a reaction estimate?  Because it is always
 a help to have the issues defined.  Because the estimate may serve
 to highlight a forgotten or glossed-over problem.  Because it may
 dispose of some wild, far-out ideas which heretofore had not been
 adequately confronted.  Because a sober and at least partially dis-
 interested accounting of risks and chances may not be available from
 any other source.  Because subsequent policy argument can perhaps
 be more realistic.
 You will notice that I have been very sparing of examples.  This
 is because all reaction estimates are classified Top Secret and dis-
 tributed. to a small readership.  In fact, they are not even accorded
 a permanent printing.  Garden-variety NIEs get their conclusions
 distributed as rapidly as possible, after USIB approval, in an informal
 ,offset version.  Subsequently the reader receives a handsome printed
 version of the full text.    Reaction estimates get the first treatment
 but not the second.  Thus their covers bear two of the finest, most
 lucid sentences ever written in the U.S. Government:
 "NOTE: This is the estimate.  No further versions will be pub-
 lished."

 Problem of ranging technical possi-
 bilities in due policy perspective.
 SCIENTIFIC ESTIMATING
 Wayne G. Jackson
 Those of us in the estimating business have a troublesome time
 with the problem of incorporating scientific or technical contributions
 into a finished estimate. To make the point, a hypothetical case re-
 lating to missiles and nuclear warheads is discussed below', 'but the
 example might as well be any complicated piece of military hardware
 or other technical subject.
 Technical Possibility
 An estimate on the advanced weapons program of Upper Volta is
 started.  In the normal routine a contribution is asked from the
 Guided Missiles and Astronautics Intelligence Committee.  In due
 course, the estimators receive a contribution which concludes that,
 on the basis of an examination of the evidence, "Upper Volta could
 have an IRBM system ready for production in 1967-68 and carry out
 deployment in 1968-69."  The economists submit a contribution saying
 that, given a high enough priority, the economy of Upper 'Volta could
 support such a program.  The political analysts find that Upper `Volta
 thinks it has an urgent requirement for such a weapons system.  So
 the estimate comes out saying that "Upper Volta could start deploying
 an IRI3M system in 1968-69."
 The Joint Atomic Energy Intelligence Committee also submits a
 contribution, one on nuclear developments.  Upper Volta has con-
 ducted a few atmospheric tests of nuclear devices, something is known
 of its general level of technical competence and production facilities;
 and so JAEIC states that warheads compatible with the IRBM's could
 be produced by the time GMAIC says the missiles could be ready for
 deployment.  So the estimate adds to its sentence on deployment of
 the missiles the words "with compatible fission warheads."  In the
 course of this exercise, what started out to be very special statements
 of raw capabilities get transformed into USIB-approved estimates that
 have an aura of probability.  While the word "could," in the estimating
 business, is understood to be purely a statement of possibility, the mere
 fact that the possibility is stated with no further qualification gives

 it something more of substance.  The reader is apt to think, "If there
 is not a good chance that the possibility will be realized, why
 mention it?"
 Hypotheses on Thin Ice
 it is possible that the estimate could be handled with so much
 emphasis on its being a mere statement of potentialities that the reader
 would not be confused into taking it as having any significant element
 of probability.  But it is doubtful if drafting could convey the tenuous-
 ness of the many technical components of the estimate.  For instance,
 the estimate that Upper Volta could have compatible nuclear war-
 heads involves in itself at least two estimates, each based on a number
 of subsidiary estimates.  What is the maximum weight of the war-
 head-including guidance, firing mechanism, etc.-which the Upper
 Volta missile can carry?  What is the likely actual weight of each
 of these components?      What are the warhead's dimensions?  It is
 highly unlikely that anyone can make more than crude guesses on
 these questions, even if we had seen a missile in the Army Day parade
 in Ougadougou.
 Similarly, we probably know little about the probable size, weight,
 and shape of the nuclear component of the postulated warhead, how
 much fissionable material would be in it, its yield, or even its general
 design.  Yet some hypotheses on all these questions underlay the
 estimate that a warhead compatible with the missile could be avail-
 able.  The estimators ask the technicians for opinions, and they oblige.
 Indeed, the estimators often ask for even more speculative data, as
 for the CEP and reliability of missiles.  Comparable estimative prob-
 lems arise in all technical subjects, e.g., capabilities for CW and BW,
 specifications for most kinds of complicated hardware such as aircraft,
 naval vessels, etc.
 The intellectual philosophy of a scientist leads him to consider his
 scientific statements, however couched in language, as hypotheses-the
 most satisfactory synthesis that he can make of the available data
 at hand.  If and as evidence changes, he will adjust the hypothesis
 accordingly, or even abandon it, without any feeling that he is chang-
 ing previously established truth.  Estimative intelligence judgments
 are of a different kind, even though they are based in large part on
 analysis of the known facts.  The intelligence estimator feels in-
 stinctively that he should state what he believes true, qualifying the
 estimate to indicate his qualms about its validity.  When it turns
 Approved For Release 2005/01/05
 8                                           CONFIDENTIAL
 out to have been wrong, even though it was the most reasonable one
 he could make on the basis of available evidence (as on the missiles
 in Cuba), he feels that he failed.  The biological researcher is not
 much upset when his hypothesis doesn't work out in laboratory tests,
 but the doctor is when the treatment he prescribes for his patient
 doesn't work and the patient dies.  This analysis or analogy cannot
 be pressed too far, but it is part of the difference between scientific
 and intelligence estimating.
 Worst-Casing
 The scientist, in making an intelligence estimate, must have in
 mind the purpose for which he is making it-as do all estimators.
 The temptation to estimate the "worst case" is just as strong with him
 as with anyone else.  If U.S. security plans are to be made on the
 basis of his estimate, it seems better that they be based on the worst
 that is reasonably possible, not on hopes which may turn out to be
 false.  This is not necessarily the phenomenon of "Pearl Harbor in-
 surance," wherein one estimates the worst, secure in the knowledge
 that if his dire predictions do not turn out, no one will blame him
 for an unexpectedly favorable course of events.  It is rather a judg-
 ment that when all hypotheses are shaky, the reader had best be pre-
 pared for the worst.  In respect of other nations' weapons, this worst
 is often arrived at by taking the best skills, experience, and technology
 known to the estimator, discounting them by a relatively small factor,
 and coming out with an estimate of raw capability.
 The non-technical estimator is at a great disadvantage in dealing
 with such technical contributions.  He can be nowhere nearly as
 familiar with the evidence as the technician or as well equipped to
 deal with it.  If he questions the hypothesis, he can often be silenced
 when his ignorance is pointed out.  (This pointing out of his lack of
 competence to deal with technical subjects is most often done by
 people who serve on technical bodies but are at best amateur scientists.
 The vigor with which hypotheses are defended as truth often seems
 inversely proportional to the technical competence of the defender.)
 The non-technical inquirer can unearth, without too much prodding,
 the vast areas of uncertainty in our evidence on advanced weapons
 systems.  But he is hard put to it to offer a more defensible judgment.
 Taking into account what we know (which is little enough) about
 Upper Volta's experiments, technical and economic resources, and
 what we believe to be its national objectives, attributing to it a. fair
 amount of the best technology we know (usually U.S. technology),

 and considering that it is better to over-warn the U.S. policy maker
 than to engender any degree of complacency by a judgment which
 cannot be documented, we thus come up with the estimate that "it
 is possible that Upper Volta could deploy IRBM's with nuclear war-
 heads in three years."
 Yet the estimator, technical or non-technical, feels in his bones that
 this worst case is highly unlikely.  Does he estimate as above and
 add "but it might just as well be three or four years later, or even
 longer?"  This hardly looks as if he's earning his living.  He is also
 affected by a conscious or unconscious desire to avoid the bias that if
 it took the United States ten years to develop an IRBM it will take
 those foreigners longer.
 Ways Out
 Does the calling in of a consulting panel help?  In most cases it is
 doubtful.  The two- or three-day panel has not kept up with the evi-
 dence, could not possibly have done so.  Just the classification of
 much of the evidence precludes this.  The panel is briefed by the
 technicians, who under the best of circumstances feed into the mech-
 anism the same data which formed their own views.  The panel has
 many of the same compulsions as the original technical group and
 is apt to produce some variation of the "worst case."  The con-
 sultant does not have to act or budget on the basis of the judgments
 he makes, and while the government estimator doesn't either, he does
 feel a longer-term responsibility for his advice to the budgeter.
 A formal intelligence estimate should whenever possible give a
 judgment as to the most likely contingency.  The scientist often says
 that there is no basis for determining the most likely.  The estimator
 is therefore in a dilemma for which there may be no solution.  Perhaps
 such estimates can only be so clothed with caveats and qualifications
 as to make them seem ethereal, and certainly annoying to the reader
 who craves certainty.  (Incidentally, the use of footnotes to call atten-
 tion to uncertainties is of limited value.  Especially when numerical
 tables are given, the footnote, usually in microscopic type, is easily
 overlooked or forgotten.)
 Perhaps it should be the rule that the non-technical estimator ingest
 the scientific contribution, append it as an annex to his estimate, and
 present his layman's best judgment with all the deprecating language
 he can think of as to the difficulty of making confident estimates.
 This is what sometimes happens.  But in most cases, those participat-

 ing in the coordination meetings on an estimate include the tech-
 nicians, professional and amateur alike, and the pressure they exert
 on the chairman of the coordinating group to accept the scientific
 contribution's language is great.  The chairman can, and often does.,
 retreat to a strict interpretation of "could," "possible," "might" and
 not try to fight the experts.  In this process the reader is likely to be
 given an impression of probability and firmness which is not warranted,

 As an example of a word that is open to all sorts of interpretations,
 let's look at a real dandy-"nationalist."  On one day in early 1964,
 I read two accounts of a crisis in Brazil's state petroleum agency,
 Petrobras.  The first was a newspaper editorial.  It said, "The na-
 tionalists in Petrobras denounce the Communists and vice versa."
 Among those that the newspaper called "nationalists" was the Petro-
 bras president.  The other account was an intelligence report.  It
 quoted a Communist leader as saying that the Petrobras president
 was trying "to demoralize the nationalists and the Communists." The
 context made it clear that the Communist leader considered the two
 groups to be allied with one another, with the president their mutual

 If a nuclear physicist were to write that "A few whatchamacallits
 created a new thingamajig when they bounced off a slew of whoosies,"
 we might suggest that his terminology needed honing.  Yet day in
 and day out we let reporters of political events (me included) get
 away with talking about "democracy," "nationalism," "insurgency,"
 "dictatorship," "totalitarianism," "the right," "the left," "the slightly left
 of center," "probability," "possibility," and many other concepts that
 lack any universally accepted definitions.
 Why?

 words nice and loose-and the mathematicians 1 haven't united to do
 something about it.  This article is one mathematician's brief for

 I once threw out to an English class in Brazil the question, "What
 is a nationalist?" The answers that came back ranged all the way
 from "a patriot" to "a Communist."  (And the fellow who said
 "patriot" was no Communist, if you're wondering.)
 What kind of word is this that means so many things to so many
 people?  It's only one member of the whole class of compound ab-
 stractions that this article is concerned with.  As a matter of fact,
 there's no dearth of definitions for these words.  Every scholar in
 the behavioral sciences setting out to write a book apparently feels
 obliged to come up with a new set of definitions uniquely his.  For
 "nationalism" our literature is rich in definitions.     Some samples:
 "Nationalism: loyalty and devotion to a nation; esp: a sense of national
 consciousness exalting one nation above all others and placing primary
 emphasis on promotion of its culture and interests as opposed to those of
 other nations or supranational groups."
 --Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary
 "Nationalism is the preference for the competitive interest of a nation
 and its members 'over those of all outsiders in a world of social mobility and
 economic competition, dominated by the values of wealth, power, and pres-
 tige, so that the goals of personal security and group identification appear
 bound up with the group's attainment of these values."
 -Karl W. Deutsch in Nationalism and Social Communication
 "It is a state of mind in which we give our paramount political loyalty
 to one fraction of the human race-to the particular tribe of which we
 happen to be tribesmen.  In so far as we are captured by this ideology,
 we hold that the highest political good for us is our own nation's sovereign
 independence; that our nation has a moral right to exercise its sovereignty
 according to what it believes to be its own national interests, whatever con-
 sequences this may entail for the foreign majority of the human race; and
 that our duty, as citizens of our country, is to support our country, right
 or wrong."
 -Arnold J. Toynbee in New York Times Sunday Magazine,
 3 November 1963
 "Nationalism, a product of political, economic, social, and intellectual
 factors at a certain stage in history, is a condition of mind, feeling, or
 sentiment of a group of people living in a well-defined geographical area,
 speaking a common language, possessing a literature in which the aspira-
 tions of the nation have been expressed, attached to common traditions and
 common customs, venerating its own heroes, and, in some cases, having a
 common religion."

 -Albert Einstein (quoted in a letter to Time,
 issue of 12 March 1965)
 -RDP78T0319Ri66Ot %030001-0
 The differences among these range from fine intellectual[ distinc-
 tions to the moral connotations strongly felt by Toynbee, whom you
 can almost see shaking his head in dismay, and Einstein, who minces
 no words at all.
 Some scholars feel a need for breaking down the concept into more
 than one category.  Hans Kohn distinguishes between (1) nationalism
 in the Western world and (2) nationalism outside the Western world.
 Snyder has suggested a chronological classification using these labels:
 integrative nationalism (1815-1871), disruptive nationalism (1.871-
 1890), aggressive nationalism (1900-1945), contemporary nationalism
 (since 1945).  Other writers have used many modifiers to show the
 variety of forms that nationalism can take: "humanitarian," "Jacobin,"
 "traditional," "liberal," "integral," "medieval," "monarchica'l," "revolu-
 tionary," "totalitarian," "cultural."
 The label is thus subject to more interpretations than the elephant
 was to the seven blind men.  But "nationalism" is unequivocally clear
 in comparison with those warped old standards "right" and "left."  At
 your next party, try a parlor game.  I-lave each guest write his defini-
 tion of these political labels.                                                                                                            Promise a prize to any two of them that
 agree.  But don't bother to have a real prize on hand; you won't
 need it.
 So much for the problem.
 Now is the time, in my opinion, to set up a board to define abstract
 concepts relevant to the intelligence business.  Because the need for
 precise verbal standards reaches its apogee in the intelligence com-
 munity., the initiative in organizing such a board should be taken by
 that community.  The coordinating role, the job of running the se-
 mantic clearing-house, should rest with an official group.
 This group should by no means work behind high walls.  On the
 contrary, it should be in close touch with the unofficial intelligence
 community, and by this I mean university faculties, book publishers,
 newspaper editors, and other private citizens who contribute to the
 flow of information that is intelligence in its broadest sense. At the
 outset of the program and perhaps periodically thereafter the board
 might invite members of this unofficial intelligence community to
 participate.
 Let's say that the board has been organized and that a hundred
 or so private entities have also agreed to take part.  Here is one
 possible modus operandi: The board chooses an abstract concept like

 one of those in the first paragraph.  A researcher compiles a selection
 of definitions already in use in some part of the world.  The board
 might meet to concoct one or more new definitions.  The board then
 sends to all participants, official and unofficial, a copy of these defini-
 tions of the term under consideration.
 At this point the board relaxes for a spell.  It gives the participants
 a good, long stretch to mull the matter over and submit comments
 and recommendations.  Six months or more would be quite reasonable
 for this phase.  This is one program that is uncrash.  The ball is
 now with the participating entities (parents, to coin an acronym).
 Their task is to recommend a single definition which employs a mini-
 mum of abstractions and relies as much as possible on quantifiable
 criteria.
 What we're asking of the parents is their help in substituting con-
 crete or otherwise measurable elements for abstract terms like the
 "competitive interest," "social mobility," and "values" in Deutsch's
 definition above.  Too wild a dream, you say?  Not at all.  One
 school of behavioral scientists has been gaining ground on the quanti-
 fication problem for at least twenty years.2
 My job does not place me in contact with them, so I can't draw
 any current examples of their work from first-hand knowledge. But
 let's suppose that one of them has been studying the correlations
 between the ethnic breakdowns of entire populations and the ethnic
 breakdowns of their national legislative bodies.  He might propose
 that one of the criteria for defining "democracy" should be just this
 correlation.  If it's better than a certain figure, the government under
 study meets one of the criteria for a democracy.  Another measurable
 phenomenon relevant to this definition: the number of political parties
 that ran candidates in the last national election.
 Getting back to the modus operandi, after the six-month incubation
 period the board considers all entries, chooses the best-very likely
 a composite of several-and publishes the results for distribution to
 members of the intelligence community and to the parents.  The
 finished product is apt to be long.  It may run to the length of a
 National Intelligence Estimate or a long magazine article. Excessive?
 'And at least two kindred spirits have made a beginning within our immediate
 community.  Both the Kent article cited earlier and "The Definition of Some
 Estimative Expressions," by David L. Wark in the same issue of the Studies,
 sought to establish a consensus on the arithmetic implications of such words as
 "possible" and "probable."
 -RDP78T03194A?60N(M30001-0
 Probably not; abstractions are like that.  When a dozen French
 mathematicians started out to make a definitive study of their subject
 they found they needed 200 pages to deal with the ins and outs of
 the number "one" alone.
 Side Benefits
 Two by-products of all this activity are worth noting.  First, with
 so much talent focussed on abstract concepts, one by one, we are
 surely going to discover newer and better ways of dividing up and
 classifying some of them.  We may invent a new term now and then
 for a newly isolated concept.  Through the board and the parents
 we will have an unprecedented test market for tentative terminology.
 Second, if well organized and managed, the board's activities will
 win the respect of influential entities outside the intelligence com-
 munity.  It will be performing a public service.  In its modest way
 it should earn some favorable press comment, and this, I submit, is
 something that the community could use.
 Our Greek forebears believed that the universe consisted of only
 four elements-fire, water, air, and earth.  Today we know of ten
 varieties, or isotopes, of a single element called tin.  A lot of people
 along the way have done a lot of classifying-and quantifying.  Some-
 body had to, of course.  Our rising level of sophistication in the physi-
 cal sciences is both a cause and a result of their work.  [n tackling
 behavioral science problems in similar fashion we will be making,, use
 of a lesson already learned by the operations researchers: "'Some of
 the intangibles that one generation treats by experience are converted

 GEO-TIME AND INTELLIGENCE
 Chronomaniac
 ". . . It often seems that in today's conditions both government and
 public are too often the captives of the spot-news report, the daily
 headline, the minute-to-minute news bulletin . . ."'
 The concept of geo-time, briefly sketched below together with
 some of its possible repercussions on intelligence, was stimulated
 partially by the writer's recent browsing in the literature of geo-
 politics.  (That subject, after being discredited by pseudo-scientific
 treatment at the hands of the Nazis and others, may he in for some
 rethinking and rehabilitation: a recent article in the Department of
 State Bulletin by the Department's Geographer appears to take a
 much saner approach to it.)  Other stimuli have been the writer's
 experience as a former analyst and part-time night duty officer and
 the increasingly manifest desire on the part of intelligence consumers
 for what amounts to "instant analysis"-in quantity and depth.
 Time Zones and Timing
 Geo-time is simply the notion that there exist, superimposed on the
 geo-political relationships of land and water masses to each other
 and of both to problems of national strategy, two equally obvious
 world physical relationships of which little account seems to have
 been taken: (1) roughly half the earth's surface being in darkness
 and the other half in daylight at any given moment; and (2) the
 phenomena of the seasons and of the polar "long clay" and "long
 night" produced by the tilt of the earth's axis.  Although many
 individuals and organizations in intelligence, as well as in the defense
 establishment generally and to some extent in other agencies dealing
 with foreign affairs, habitually take these relationships into their
 daily calculations for technical if for no other reasons, I have the
 impression that no consciously coordinated effort has yet been made

 to think through the many implications and possible applications of
 this concept in various fields.  Hoping that such a comprehensive
 effort may be undertaken by those competent to do so, I shall confine
 myself here to an introductory consideration of the impact of gco-time
 on an activity with which I am familiar, intelligence analysis, merely
 noting a few other possible implications.
 First a word on the real and practical importance of geo-time.
 Historically, men have long been familiar with the "night watch"
 concept, which in much more sophisticated form has necessarily been
 adopted by intelligence as well as military organizations.  In some
 fields;, particularly military, the day-night and seasonal factors are
 crucial in questions relating to attack and defense.  It is superfluous
 to point out that the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor could not have
 been better timed to catch our forces off balance.  Making use of
 complications arising from the overlayering of the day-night and
 seasonal factors by varying social customs around the globe, the con-
 cept has been successfully employed in such limited time zones as
 western Europe for timing critical communiques or ultimata so as
 to take greatest advantage of another power's press deadlines or
 long weekends and holiday slackness.  Even within the comparatively
 small time region covered by the continental United States, there has
 been recent debate whether televising election results from the east
 coast affects the late vote in the far west.  All these observations
 suggest reasons for systematically applying geo-time in intelligence,
 now that a "collapse of space" has been produced by modern com-
 munications.
 Analysis and Reporting
 So far as intelligence analysis is concerned-and to some extent
 the reporting of raw intelligence and the operations which produce
 such reports-I submit that our system of virtually instantaneous
 transmission and rapid dissemination of information from all quarters
 of the globe and from all sources including the press deserves re-
 examination in the light of geo-time both in Washington and in the
 field.  The hour of day or night at which a given message arrives,
 and the season of its arrival in this north temperate zone, almost
 inevitably affect the quality as well as the timeliness of the analysis,
 particularly of the "instant" variety.  The main reason is the cus-
 tomary disparity between analytical resources available during the
 normal working day and those readily available after office hours,
 while the intelligence material now flows in as steadily by night as by
 day.  I am aware of recent efforts to tighten the night watch and
 increase round-the-clock analysis and production capability through-
 out the community, but I am inclined to doubt .that these efforts are
 nearly as far-reaching as what a detailed study of the impact of geo-
 time might lead to.
 Simply to illustrate the problem in its crudest form, the day-night
 factor without reference to seasons or social customs, the two tables
 on page 22 juxtapose Washington and field times, highlighting (1)
 the most disadvantageous hours for analysis and production capabili-
 ties in Washington, and (2) the most disadvantageous times, depend-
 ing on locality, for collection and reporting in the field.  The calcula-
 tions are based only on the schematic division of the globe into 24
 equal time zones; to be truly useful they would have to take account
 of latitude, season, arbitrary local time, and local customs.  The
 nature of the activities generating the information reports would also
 be a factor, since some are obviously best conducted by night and
 others by day.  The crudeness of these tables should riot, however,
 obscure their implications; it simply reflects the writer's lack of specific
 area knowledge covering all points of intelligence interest and his
 not having the skill and leisure to pursue this matter as far as it
 seems to warrant.
 Aside from the implications of each table separately, a comparison
 of the two suggests that Washington is particularly at a disadvantage
 in terms of its own staffing during the optimum field reporting times
 in most of the areas which are currently most troublesome and are
 likely to be so in the foreseeable future.  A case could also be made
 for the existence of doubly critical periods when the bracketed areas
 of Table II heavily overlap Table I regional times, showing Wash-
 ington and field capabilities to be in balance because both .arc poor.
 A review of the implications of geo-time might suggest further
 changes not only in staffing for after-hours intelligence analysis and
 production but in the two-way flow of communications between
 Washington and the field.  This might improve coordination and
 direction of the field in administrative as well as operational matters.
 The conscious and complete adaptation of the geo-time concept to a
 variety of political as well as military tactics might also be con-
 sidered; e.g., major pronouncements affecting foreign governments
 might be timed less with an eye to the convenience of the domestic
 press than, say, to precipitating an atmosphere of crisis, if that is

 A theory and some practice in
 strategic air targeting against
 Japan.
 B-29s AGAINST COKE OVENS
 A. R. Northridge
 The operations of an air intelligence section may often, even in
 an active theater of war, be too routine and colorless to offer much
 amusement or instruction to another generation.  I recount below,
 however, one episode from my experience as intelligence officer for
 Major General Claire Chennault which is not without color and not
 uninstructive.  If the story seems biased against the Washington ap-
 paratus, that is the bias of the man on the spot in contact with the job.
 Big Order
 In 1943 Chennault's 14th USAAF in Western China was ordered
 to proceed with the construction of a new complex of airfields at
 designated locations.  The specifications for the thickness of the run-
 ways and their length made it plain that these bases were intended
 for a new type of aircraft, much larger and having much longer
 range than any in our inventory or any we had ever heard of.  Since
 the fields had to be built by hand labor, locally recruited, several
 hundred thousands of Chinese shared in this information.  But we
 knew only thus by inference that we were to be so reinforced.    We
 were told nothing of the new plane.  We in the intelligence section
 were not tasked with finding targets for it (though we did so any-
 way).  Indeed, and this was the crowning indignity, we were not
 even ordered to refrain from speculating about it.  Some of us worked
 up estimates of its specifications which turned out not to be far off.'
 Airfield construction in the China section of the CBI 'Theater was a
 slow proposition.  Powered construction equipment was scarce, and
 in all remaining China not in Japanese hands, there was not a single
 New arrivals from over the Hump told of the construction of similar new
 fields in eastern India, but no visitors from the States could confirm the existence
 of an aircraft having the specifications we envisaged.  I suspect General Chen-
 nault had been told that a new, larger bomber was in the works, but I very
 much doubt that he knew its actual size and range.  He certainly appeared
 surprised at the eventual briefing when these figures were given, probably more
 surprised than some members of his staff.                  pn1)         ~1~

 powered rock crusher.  The rock for paving the runways, aprons, and
 taxi strips was all crushed by hand, small children working with light
 hammers on the smaller stones alongside their elders hammering on
 the larger ones.  But eventually the fields were completed; the Air
 Force Engineer was rewarded by a promotion and a decoration; and
 at long last a team of senior officers arrived from Washington, repre-
 sentatives of the joint Chiefs of Staff, to explain what this was all about.
 New Program
 The briefing took place in General Chennault's office.  The B-29
 was described and we were told how many would come to China.
 They were to be organized as the XXth Bomber Command, which
 was, and would remain, under the control of the joint Chiefs.  The
 CBI Theater and its China component in particular had certain sup-
 port responsibilities toward the Command, but no authority over it.
 This displeased General Chennault, of course, and he made no
 secret of it.
 Next we were told that the employment of the Command, its
 program, had already been determined.  If General Chennault dis-
 approved of this program, he could, as the senior American Air Force
 commander in China and on behalf of the senior American commander
 in the Theater, Lieutenant General Stilwell, make known to the joint
 Chiefs his disagreement.  They would not necessarily heed him, but
 he could comment if he chose.  It was clear that this provision like-
 wise held no particular charm for the General, especially since he
 would have to divert the better part of a composite wing from its
 offensive operations to the defense of the XXth Command's bases.
 The program, we were told, provided first of all for a mission from
 the ]Indian fields against Bangkok to tune up the Command.  It would
 then move to its China fields.  The General nodded.         Next, the
 briefers continued, now somewhat diffident, would be a mission under-
 taken by the entire Command against the Japanese islands, the par-
 ticular target being Tokyo.
 General Chennault demurred, loudly.  From the figures they had
 just given, he said, the bomb payload at that distance would have to
 be calculated at mere hundreds of pounds per plane.  He enlarged
 on this theme with such vigor that the briefers, who were by no
 means unsophisticated officers, could see that although he might
 reconcile himself to JCS direct control over the XXth Bomber Com-
 mand, if they attempted a large-scale mission against Tokyo from the
 China bases, he might tell them to find a new commanding general

 for the 14th USAAF.  The subject of the Tokyo raid was thereupon
 dropped, and it was not revived.2
 When General Chennault had concluded his remarks, a junior
 member of the briefing team, hitherto silent, opened an enormous
 briefcase, took out an armful of handsomely bound books each the
 size of a copy of Fortune, and passed them around.  Calling attention
 to their Top Secret classification, he said the brochures described
 the balance of the program and its rationale, the target: system U.S.
 intelligence had selected for the China-based B-29s to attack.  If he
 might presume, the briefer went on, he would suggest that we rapidly
 run through them, the material being quite complicated, and he would
 answer any queries that immediately occurred to us.  Then we could
 review them in detail overnight-it was now nearly midnight--and
 if we had further questions, he would be available between nine
 and ten the next morning before he and his colleagues emplaned
 for Washington.  He left the impression that they were anxious to
 get this pro forma ceremony out of the way; the die had been cast
 and there was no thought of allowing a fresh throw.
 To follow the printed plan in detail was, as the briefer had sug-
 gested, more than ordinarily difficult.  Charts, graphs, and text (lone
 up with Byzantine opulence were combined in an explication, or better
 justification, that we all found obscure.  What was being justified,
 however, was clear enough.  The target system was the Japanese
 coke industry.  The JCS had apparently been persuaded by a bevy
 of intelligence analysts that no better use could be found for the XXth
 Bomber Command, a new instrument designed for the destruction of
 Japan's military might, than to launch it against Japan's coke ovens
 wherever they might be.  Within four years, said the briefer, if the
 attacks were successful and so sustained that repairs were impossible,
 and if no new coke manufacturing capacity were constructed by the
 Japanese undetected by us, within four years-that is by 1947--the
 Japanese steel industry would begin to feel the pinch of coke shortage,
 and soon thereafter the Japanese armament industry would begin to
 feel the pinch of a steel shortage.
 Recalcitrance
 The realization on the part of the 14th USAAF staff that this mag-
 nificent new weapon with its enormous supporting base was being
 deployed a good two-thirds of the way around the globe to bomb
 'I have often wondered if this far-out proposal was not a ploy to soften us up
 for those that immediately followed.  It was, of course, a highly impractical idea
 and I feel sure the briefers knew it.

 coke ovens gave rise to wonderment-and argument.  Each of us
 could think of targets by the score that were vulnerable to the B-29s
 and if attacked with vigor would save countless Chinese and American
 lives.  To cite but one example, despite the slight pressure that the
 14th Air Force could exert, slight because of our logistic transport
 difficulties, the Japanese had accumulated large stocks of materiel
 at Hankow.  With this they had launched a drive that cost the 14th
 its eastern airfields and gave the Japanese an overland route between
 their Hong Kong-Canton enclave and their holdings on the middle
 Yangtze and the North China plain.  Unequipped to offer serious
 resistance, the Chinese suffered personnel losses, military and civilian,
 numbering in the tens of thousands. The XXth Bomber Command
 could have destroyed the Hankow supply dumps in a single strike.
 Or, again within easy range under a full bomb load, there was
 on 'Taiwan an operational air depot where new aircraft, fresh from
 the Japanese factories, were readied for combat and ferried off to the
 Philippines and the southwest Pacific to do battle with General
 Kenney's air forces and Admiral Nimitz' ships and the planes from his
 carriers.  The destruction of this depot could well have shortened
 our approach to the Philippines and saved considerable losses in men,
 ships, and aircraft.3
 As the debate began to get acrimonious, the briefers left us.  We
 spent the rest of the night studying their brochure and preparing an
 alternative plan for them to carry back to the JCS.  We had not
 worked very long, plowing through the impressive presentation, before
 we could see that the conclusions reached were derived from elab-
 orately contrived projections of equally elaborate hypotheses which
 were based, in the end, on meager data of dubious authenticity.  This
 is an important point.  The program was a scholarly piece of work,
 honestly researched and presented without gloss.  The argument was
 logically flawless, but the authors simply lacked the basic data neces-
 sary to determine the proper use of the China-based B-29s.                         It
 became eminently plain that someone in Washington who had a fixa-
 tion about the role of coke in Japan's war economy had enlisted
 followers and somehow taken the JCS by storm.     He must have been
 a very persuasive man.
 It scarcely needs saying that the alternative program we prepared
 for the XXth Bomber Command was found wanting in Washington,
 'Eventually, as mentioned below, the China-based B-29s mounted strikes against
 both of these targets, but late and with low priority.  In the meantime they had
 been of much service to the enemy.

 and it was not long before the B-29s reached China under the
 original plan.4
 The Yawata Strike
 Even though the planes could not cover the distance with anything
 like a full bomb load, the target selected for their initial mission was
 the Yawata steel plant, on Kyushu near the Straits of Shimonoseki,
 because it was here that Washington said Japan's largest collection
 of coke ovens was to be found.  I do not recall any very convincing
 reasons for this estimate, but the ovens were brightly printed in
 colored ink on the target charts and Washington was convinced that
 the B-29s would find them there.
 We learned of the decision to hit Yawata only a few days before
 the strike was scheduled, when the XXth Bomber Command sent us
 a message asking would we kindly provide pre-strike and post-strike
 aerial photography of the target.  This presented some diffi.cult:ies for
 us.  The Yawata area lay beyond the range of a photo plane flying
 from any of our fields.  There was, however, a field in guerrilla-held
 territory near the coast.  If the weather conditions were just right
 (and this was predictable only within the narrowest of limits) and
 if the Japanese stayed where they were-they could take the field
 in a day's operation, and had done so in the past whenever they
 chose-the flight could be accomplished.
 This scarcely practicable procedure had actually been carried out
 once some time earlier.  The pilot had not made it quite as far as
 Yawata, and during his time over the target an unanticipated layer
 of clouds lay between his cameras and the ground; but there was
 no denying that he had overflown a part of Kyushu and returned
 safely, though with no considerable reserves of fuel.  It also hap-
 pened that this pilot, having completed the required number of
 missions, was still in China, about to embark at any moment on his
 ' Their passage to their new bases was attended by a curious incident.  Coming
 over the Hump, one squadron was intercepted by a Japanese fighter evidently
 flown by a very wise pilot.  He flew on all sides of the formation, estimating the
 planes' size and cruising speed.  Then he moved in close enough to draw fire and
 so learned most of what there was to know about their defensive armament and
 fire control.  Then he pulled away, wagged his wings, and took off for his home
 field in northern Burma to report what he had seen.  A week earlier the very
 presence of the B-29 in China had officially been classified Secret.  In spite of
 the fact that the Japanese now knew more about the plane than any Americans
 except a handful of General Chennault's staff and the XXth Bomber Command
 personnel, this classification remained in force for months, until the press could
 re ort its first offensive mission.

 return flight to the States.  He was apprised of the XXth Bomber
 Command request.  After the briefest cogitation, and on learning
 that there was still available for consultation a certain weather officer
 whom he believed to be in some kind of direct communication with
 the elements, he volunteered to fly to Yawata once, not twice, if the
 weather officer found the omens favorable. His offer was accepted, and
 the weather was found good enough, barely, for a post-strike mission.
 The photo mission was flown a few days after the strike and the
 pilot returned safely, though his fuel ran out before he could taxi
 his plane off the runway.  A duplicate negative and a set of prints,
 made at an East China field, were delivered to the 14th Air Force
 Headquarters in Kunming only minutes before the arrival of a plane
 carrying General Wolfe, who commanded the XXth Bomber Com-
 mand, and a large part of his staff.  When we had had a hasty look
 at the prints and had told General Chennault what they showed,
 it was his decision that they be given to General Wolfe without
 comment.  General Chennault suggested to him that he would doubt-
 less prefer to have his own photo interpreters make the post-strike
 assessment.  General Wolfe, thus having been made aware, indirectly
 and most courteously, that his interpreters would see nothing to
 delight him, motioned to his aide to pick up the package and left
 for his plane and his headquarters.
 We had, of course, our own set of prints.  A more leisurely perusal
 confirmed our original impression, that the Yawata plant was un-
 damaged.  Furthermore, the area that on the target charts had been
 so liberally sprinkled with coke oven symbols was in reality a sandspit
 in a shallow bay, with no buildings other than a shack or two within
 three-quarters of a mile.  The coke ovens, less than half as many as
 predicted, were even farther distant and also unscathed.  Indeed, no
 bomb craters were visible in the assigned target area at all.
 As we continued to study the magnificent photography, which
 covered in detail a large area of strategic importance, we found, some
 twelve miles from the target, the fresh ruins of an industrial estab-
 lishment the existence of which had previously been unknown.  A
 complete rebuilding job would now obviously be necessary to put
 it back in production.  We later learned that this had been Japan's
 second largest tank factory, smashed by mistake.
 Coke Phased Out
 For a time the war on the coke ovens continued.  The next mission

 member its name.  Here, it was said, the intelligence depicted on the
 target charts was reliable because it came directly from the plans
 of the plant, which had been drawn by an American firm engaged
 to design the entire installation. Since this objective was nearer
 than Kyushu, we were able to promise and deliver photo coverage
 both before and after the strike.  The pre-strike photography showed
 the target charts were wrong again.  There were coke ovens about
 where the chart showed them to be, but there were only a small
 fraction of the number it showed.  The owners had evidently decided
 to build a plant of smaller capacity than the one designed.  Since
 this was a daylight mission instead of a night strike-at Yawata most
 of the bombing was done by radar-quite a few of the coke ovens
 were destroyed or damaged.
 After this mission the B-29s still took an occasional crack at coke
 ovens--though never any as distant as Yawata's-but more and more
 they took their targets from the 14th Air Force list of strategic
 priorities.  Even when they did go out to attack coke facilities, more
 and more of them aborted part way to the assigned targets and
 attacked instead a nearer alternative picked from the 14th Air Force
 list.  By and by the Marianas were taken, and fields built there be-
 came the new home of the XXth Bomber Command, reconstituted as
 the 20th USAAF and charged with battering Japan's home islands.
 In China, except for a handful of B-29s equipped with cameras for
 mapping photography,5 we saw them no more and turned our atten-
 tion from coke ovens to other things.
 'A slightly different employment of these photo planes, one that might quite
 logically have been made, might well have changed the course of history in East
 Asia.  What they did was plod back and forth photographing untold thousands
 of square miles of territory of no conceivable strategic interest, though doubtless
 holding a certain fascination for the cartographer.  Properly equipped and
 targeted, they would have detected the Asiatic ports nearest Japan to be all but
 barren of maritime traffic, permitting the conclusion that our extensive mining
 of the Korean Straits and our destruction of Japanese shipping had in effect cut
 Japan off from the mainland of Asia.  With this link broken, and the home islands
 deprived of all the external support required for their economy and the very
 lives of their people, Japan's capacity to continue fighting was negligible.  A
 more continuation of the blockade and the aerial offensive then being carried on
 must soon force a surrender, quite possibly without the use of exotic weapons
 or the Soviet Union's late participation.  As it was, the first photo coverage of
 Manchurian and Korean ports was accomplished by the 14th Air Force.  It is my
 recollection that these flights were made less than a month before the war ended.

 MEMORANDA FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 JAPANESE FEELERS
 The last two volumes of the OSS Reports to the White House pre-
 served among General Donovan's papers i include records of several
 different Japanese approaches in 1945 to the Vatican and to OSS Lis-
 bon, Bern, and Wiesbaden seeking a way to end the war.  These
 peace feelers were generally the product of local initiative and had
 at most only a tacit approval from official Tokyo, where government
 quarreling over the question of capitulation was growing more and
 more desperate as the year advanced.  They did not lead in any
 way to the eventual Japanese notes sent through standard diplomatic
 channels on 10 and 14 August, but they may have helped define for
 both sides the conditions therein drawn which made "unconditional"
 surrender a practical possibility.
 The intelligence reports provide interesting and sometimes puzzling
 footnotes for Robert J. C. Butow's fastidious-and fascinating-re-
 construction of the intricate political maneuverings that ended in
 Japan's Decision to Surrender.2  The documents are reproduced
 below.

 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 On 10 January the Japanese Emperor attended a secret council
 meeting during which someone dared to speak about peace feelers.-3
 ' Described in the first of this series, subtitled "Sunrise," in Studies VII 2, p. 73 if.
 ' Stanford University Press, 1954.
 Butow, who had examined the Japanese records most thoroughly, does not
 mention such a 10 January meeting.  It was at this time, however, with the
 American return to the Philippines, that the Emperor and the government began
 to be seriously worried about the outcome of the war.  On 6 January the Emperor
 proposed consulting the senior statesmen (former premiers) about the war situa-
 tion, and individual audiences were set up for them during February.  The im-
 perial favorite among them, Prince Konoye, declaring that "Japan has already
 lost the war," suggested purging the military of its extremists in order to clear

 The Emperor was informed that certain Japanese individuals have
 been attempting to interest the highest authority at source I in mediat-
 ing the Pacific War.  The Emperor did not express any disapproval
 of these efforts.
 Someone at the meeting declared that such activities might be a
 useful preparation for a time more opportune than the present.  The
 Council was skeptical of mediation possibilities, evidently believing
 that only force of arms would settle the conflict.
 24 January 1945
 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 On 17 January a conference, the substance of which is reported
 below, took place with the following people present:
 Ma.sahide Kanayama, Japanese representative at the Holy See
 Giovani Montini, acting Secretary of State
 Mgr. Domenico Tardini, President of the Pontifical Commission
 for Russia
 Pio Rossignani, Private Secretary of the Pope
 KANAYAMA: The pacifists in Japan have great faith in the Holy
 See.  An attempt by the Holy See to initiate mediation would greatly
 encourage our pacifists, even if there should be no immediate con-
 crete results.
 MoNTINI: It is clear to us that the gap between the viewpoints of
 the two belligerents is too wide to permit Papal mediation.
 TARDINI:  Japanese adherence to the tripartite pact seriously hurts
 the Japanese case in Allied countries.  World opinion stigmatizes
 Japan as an aggressor, and even Soviet Russia concurs.
 KANAYAMA: Our Ambassador in Moscow has informed our Gov-
 ernment that the Far East will be discussed when the Big Three
 meet.  The United States, supported by Churchill, will ask for Russian
 help to crush us completely.  The Anglo-Americans will ask that
 Russia denounce the pact of non-aggression with Japan and that
 Russia passively participate in the Pacific War and permit Anglo-
 American use of Russian air bases.  Our Government also under-
 stands that, before Stalin will agree to this, he will request a whole-
 hearted attempt on the part of the Anglo-Americans to mediate, and
 that he will even offer to act as mediator.  Our Government also
 understands that the Big Three will discuss European problems first,
 and that if they are not settled to Russia's satisfaction, especially the
 Polish question, then Stalin will not discuss the Far East.
 TARDINI: The United States and England have already made a
 declaration on Poland.  American public opinion is behind Roosevelt.
 KANAYAMA:  It is a diplomatic maneuver to draw concessions from
 Russia.  Moreover, Roosevelt and Churchill have another move to
 make against Russia.    Turkey and the countries of the Middle East
 are ready to enter the war against us.  Stalin is opposed to these
 countries entering either the Pacific or the European War.
 ROSSIGNANI: In view of all this, would it not be better for the
 Pope to synchronize his mediation with that of Stalin?
 KANAYAMA:  On the contrary, it is urgent that His Holiness come
 to our assistance before the Big Three meet to discuss Japan, and
 that this mediation be in full swing at the time.  Stalin is interested
 in close collaboration with the Anglo-Americans, but he wishes to
 gain the maximum benefits from this collaboration.  Stalin knows
 that the Japanese reaction will be swift when it becomes evident
 that Russian denunciation of the non-aggression pact is imminent.
 There may be a stiffening of Japanese resistance, or the pacifists may
 prevail.  In this latter case, Stalin would cut a big figure, and be
 would be able to gain satisfying terms for the Anglo-Americans.
 And even to the Japanese he might appear as the savior of Japan
 from destruction.  Stalin desires to have De Gaulle at the coming
 conference, but Roosevelt and Churchill are opposed.  However,
 should De Gaulle be admitted to the conference, then Chiang Kai-
 shek will be present also.
 MONTINI:  Would it not be possible for the Japanese Government
 to offer terms that would be closer to those of the Anglo-Americans
 so that the Holy See could begin mediation on more concrete bases?
 KANAYAMA: We will communicate your request to our government
 at once, together with an account of this conference.  Meanwliile, it
 would be useful if the Holy See would begin mediation attempts.
 RossIGNANI: Very well.  This evening I will present Mr, Kana-
 yama's memorandum and the minutes of this conference to His
 Holiness.

 The following is source's account  of the conference held on 19
 January between the Pope and Mr. Myron Taylor:
 When asked whether he considered Papal mediation in the Pacific
 war possible, Taylor was skeptical.  He stated that recent develop-
 ments had evidently not brought the Japanese point of view any
 closer to that of the Anglo-Americans.  The Pope asked if he would
 discuss the situation with the Japanese Ambassador to the Holy See,
 and Taylor replied that he was neither an official nor semi-official
 representative of the United States, and accordingly could speak
 only as a private individual.  Taylor promised to communicate with
 the President, for which the Pope thanked him, and asked him to
 explain the sentiments which animated this inquiry.
 2 February 1945
 On 25 January, Harada Ken, Japanese Ambassador to the Holy
 See, made the following assertions to the Pope:
 The Japanese Government would be willing to interpret the Vatican's
 wishes to the Kremlin.
 The Kremlin has assured the Japanese Ambassador in Moscow that
 Russia will ask the Anglo-Americans to attempt to reach a negotiated
 peace in the Pacific, provided the Japanese Government accepts the
 Soviet proposal that the Far East peace conference include Russia,
 China, Great Britain, the United States, France, and japan.'' . . .
 Reports from this source in the Vatican were code-named Vessel.  By March
 some of them were proved false, and it was soon suspected that many of them
 had been fabricated or planted.  This may explain the discrepancies between
 them and Butow's account.
 Butow touches on these feelers through the Vatican only in one footnote
 reference to an AP dispatch of the preceding 17 July, shortly after the fall of
 Saipan, reporting Harada to have told the Pope that Japan was ready for any
 peace that would leave its national life and economy intact.  The report was
 categorically denied by a government spokesman in Tokyo.

 Source 7 has been informed by connections in Japan that the Japa-
 nese Government is confident that Stalin will categorically refuse
 to abrogate the non-aggression pact with Japan.  The Japanese hope
 for new Soviet-Japanese pacts strengthening the non-aggression pact.
 The Japanese Government feels that Japan can continue the Pacific
 war indefinitely in view of Russia's certain refusal to enter the war.
 Japan therefore cannot reduce its minimum terms for a peace
 settlement.
 16 February 1945
 The following is a resume of the first talk between Myron Taylor
 and Harada Ken, Japanese Ambassador to the Holy See, as reported
 by Vessel:
 Harada declared that Japanese elements desirous of peace are not
 responsible for the Pacific war, and that those elements might be able
 to make their will felt if the Anglo-Americans would offer acceptable
 terms.
 Taylor reminded Harada that American public opinion still re-
 members the unprovoked attack on Pearl Harbor.  He promised,
 however, to initiate a friendly investigation of the possibilities for
 negotiation.
 Taylor and Harada agreed that the terms of the two belligerent
 groups, as they knew them, were too far apart to permit: negotiations.
 Harada stated that the United States' chief war aim apparently was
 a victory that would give Japanese pacifist elements ascendancy over
 the military and prevent any future militarist aggression.  He added
 that Japan was exhausted by the war she has been fightin  since
 1937, and that she needs a long period of peace.

 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 An OSS representative has transmitted the following information,
 reportedly sent to the Vatican on 6 April 8 by Lorenzo Tatewaki Toda,
 the Apostolic Delegate in Yokohama:
 Tatewaki Toda, who is a member of a Japanese princely family
 and related to the Emperor, proposes to call on the Emperor in order
 to "comfort him with the certain hope that the Holy See will not
 abandon its attempt at mediation" of the war in the Pacific.  Tatewaki
 Toda believes that the present is the most favorable moment to
 conquer the intransigence of the extreme militarists in the interests
 of a peaceful solution to the war.  He promises as soon as possible
 to send the Holy See a set of conditions which it may judge acceptable
 to the Anglo-Americans, and he beseeches the Pope to pray that
 Japan's rulers may become convinced of the necessity of an honorable
 peace.
 31 May 1945
 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 The following information has been transmitted by the OSS repre-
 sentative in Lisbon:
 On 7 May 1945 the OSS representative reported that during a
 contact with a regular source of varying reliability, source stated
 that he had been asked by Masutaro Inoue, Counsellor of the Japa-
 nese Legation in Portugal, to contact United States representatives.
 Source quoted Inoue as saying that the Japanese are ready to cease
 hostilities, provided they are allowed to retain possession of their
 home islands.  Inoue stressed American and Japanese "common in-
 terests" against the USSR.  He said, however, that unconditional sur-
 render would not be acceptable to Japan.
 (The OSS representative believes that Inoue selected this par-
 ticular source to carry his message to American representatives,
 because of source's long experience in Portugal and Japan.)
 8 That is, just after the assault on Okinawa, the collapse of the Koiso cabinet,
 and the USSR's announcement that its neutrality pact with Japan would not
 be renewed.

 A-RDP78T03196OF1-0
 On 19 May, the OSS representative reported that Inoue again had
 repeated to source his desire to talk with an American representative.
 On this occasion Inoue declared that actual peace terms were un-
 important so long as the term "unconditional surrender" was not
 employed.  The Japanese, he asserted, are convinced that within a
 few weeks all of their wood and paper houses will be destroyed.
 Inoue insisted, however, that such destruction would not lead to
 unconditional surrender and that the war would still be prosecuted in
 China.  The destruction of the Meiji Jinja shrine, Inoue added, had
 strengthened Japanese will to resist.
 [The information contained in the above messages was given the
 United States Ambassador by the OSS representative.]
 The OSS representative on 23 May reported that the United States
 Ambassador, after consultation with the British and Chinese, in-
 structed that Inoue be told he must show proof that he is authorized
 to speak for the Japanese Government and that he is prepared to
 discuss unconditional surrender-the only basis acceptable to the
 United States.
 12 May 1945
 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 The following information, transmitted by the OSS representative
 in Bern,' originates with a German source, an authority on the Far
 East who is considered anti-Nazi but pro-Japanese: 10
 The source, on 11 May, talked with Shunichi Kase, the Japanese
 Minister to Switzerland.  He reports that Kase expressed a wish to
 help arrange for a cessation of hostilities between the Japanese and
 the Allies.  Kase reportedly considers direct talks with the Americans
 and the British preferable to negotiations through the USSR,71 because
 the latter eventually would increase Soviet prestige so much that the
 whole Far East would become Communist.
 ? Allen Dulles.
 '? Butow identifies this man as a Dr. Friedrich Hack (apparently in retrans-
 literation from the Japanese "Hakku") and connects hint with incidental references
 in Willoughby's Shanghai Conspiracy to a man named Haak or Haag.
 "The official Japanese efforts to bring an end to the war were all mistakenly
 directed at securing Soviet mediation.  These efforts continued right up to the
 Soviet: invasion of Manchuria on 9 August.

 Kase allegedly believes that one of the few provisions the Japanese
 would insist upon would be the retention of the Emperor as the only
 safeguard against Japan's conversion to Communism.  Kase feels
 that Under Secretary of State Grew, whom he considers the best
 US authority on Japan, shares this opinion.

 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 The following information, transmitted by the OSS representative
 in Bern on 2 June, is a sequel to memorandum dated 12 May 1945
 concerning an alleged Japanese peace feeler.    The source of the
 information is the same German authority on the Far East who is
 considered anti-Nazi but pro-Japanese:
 Source is in touch with Fujimura, who is understood to be one of
 the principal Japanese naval representatives in Europe and a former
 Assistant Naval Attache in Berlin.  Fujimura is reported to be in
 direct and secret contact by cable with the Japanese Minister of
 Marine [Navy?] and is believed to enjoy the confidence of the Japa-
 nese Government.
 Fujimura indicated to source that the Navy circles who now control
 [?] the Japanese Government would be willing to surrender but wish,
 if possible, to save some face from the present wreckage.  These Navy
 circles, he declares, particularly stress the necessity of preserving the
 Emperor in order to avoid Communism and chaos.  Fujimura empha-
 sizes that Japan can not supply itself with basically essential food-
 stuffs and is dependent upon Korea for sugar and rice.  He also insists
 that Japan needs to retain some of its merchant marine for necessary
 food imports.12
 22 June 1945
 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 The following information, transmitted by the OSS representative
 in Bern, is a sequel to memoranda dated 12 May and 4 June concern-
 ing peace feelers emanating reportedly from the Japanese Legation in
 Bern. The source of the information is the same German authority
 referred to in previous memoranda, a description of whom is ap-
 pended below:
 According to source, Fujimura insists that the Japanese, before
 surrendering, would require assurances that the Emperor would be
 retained.  Fujimura has read accounts in the Bern press of Mr. Allen
 Dulles' part in arranging for the German capitulation in North Italy.
 Fujimura is obviously interested in knowing what terms short of
 unconditional surrender might have been granted these Germans.rs
 [Source is a German national who was taken prisoner by the Japa-
 nese in World War I.  Upon his release he remained in Japan and
 established important commercial relations there.  He placed Japa-
 nese purchases in Germany, made a substantial fortune, and gained
 the confidence of high Japanese circles, particularly in the Navy.
 Some years ago he returned to Europe and, as he was persona non
 grata with the Hitler Government, took up residence in Zurich.  He
 maintained contacts, however, with Japanese circles in Berlin, par-
 ticularly with Admiral Nomura, the Japanese Naval Attache.  He is
 understood to have advised the Japanese two years ago that Germany
 would be decisively defeated, while Ambassador Oshima. at that
 time officially predicted a German victory. ]
 Butow carries a detailed account of this approach from Yoshiro Fujimura's
 own testimony, but there are gross discrepancies especially with respect to dates.
 It has Hack meeting as intermediary for Fujimura with Gero von Gaevernitz and
 others of Mr. Dulles' staff from 23 April on and Mr. Dulles receiving authorization
 "from the State Department" to continue the meetings on 3 May.  According to
 this account Minister Shunichi Kase, whose 11 May approach is reported above,
 did not enter the picture until 20 June, when Tokyo finally instructed Fujimura
 to work with him.  Fujimura is said to have cabled urgent operational dispatches
 to the Navy chiefs in Tokyo on 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 18, 20, and four later dates in
 May, presenting the contact as effected on American initiative and urging that
 he be authorized to negotiate.  But in Tokyo there was too much opposition even
 in Navy circles, most notably from Naval Chief of Staff Toyoda.

 Japanese Feelers
 to approach Allied authorities through OSS representatives in Switzer-
 land:
 Per Jacobson,14 a Swedish national and economic adviser to the
 Bank for International Settlements, has been approached by Kojiro
 Kitamura, a director of the Bank, a representative of the Yokohama
 Specie Bank and former financial attache in Berlin.  Kitamura indi-
 cated to Jacobson that he was anxious to establish immediate contact
 with American representatives and implied that the only condition on
 which Japan would insist with respect to surrender would be some
 consideration for the Japanese Imperial family.  Kitamura showed
 that he was completely familiar with OSS operations which led to
 the surrender of the German forces in North Italy, and declared that
 he wished to establish a contact similar to that made by General
 Karl Wolff.
 According to Jacobson, Kitamura is acting with the consent of the
 Japanese Minister to Switzerland, Shunichi Kase, and is working with
 Brigadier General Kiyotomi Okamoto, a former Japanese Military
 Attache in Bern.  [Okamoto is probably the chief of Japanese Intelli-
 gence in Europe.]  Kitamura claims that the Japanese group in
 Switzerland has direct communications with Tokyo and is in a posi-
 tion to make definite commitments.
 (Responsible OSS cut-out sources who talked with Jacobson at
 Basel believe that the Kitamura approach was initiated locally rather
 than on the basis of instructions from Tokyo.  Hence it is difficult
 to assess the seriousness of the approach.
 (The OSS representative in Bern reports that Jacobson has urgently
 requested him to come to Basel to see him this coming week-end.
 The OSS representative has declined the invitation but has told
 Jacobson that he could see him in Bern L' on Sunday, 15 July.  The
 OSS representative in Bern will see Jacobson only to obtain such
 intelligence as Jacobson is able to give, and expects to treat the
 entire matter with the greatest caution and reserve.)

 1.6 July 1945
 The following information, a sequel to a memorandum dated 13
 July . . . has been received from Mr. Allen Dulles in Wiesbaden. .. .
 Jacobsson reports that between 10 and 13 July he had a series of
 conferences with Yoshimura, a Japanese official attached to the Bank
 for International Settlements, and Kojiro Kitamura, a director of the
 Bank, representative of the Yokohama Specie Bank, and former finan-
 cial attache in Berlin.  Yoshimura and Kitamura claim to be acting
 in consultation with the Japanese Minister to Switzerland, Shunichi
 Kase, and Brigadier General Kiyotomi Okamoto, former Japanese
 military attache in Bern, who now is believed to be chief of Japanese
 Intelligence in Europe. Yoshimura and Kitamura claim further that
 Kase and Okamoto have direct and secret means of communicating
 with the Japanese Chief of Staff.  Yoshimura also claims that the
 peace group which he represents includes General Ushijiro Umezu,
 Army Chief of Staff; 18 Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai, Minister of Navy;
 and Shigenori Togo, Foreign Minister.
 Yoshimura and Kitamura appeared to Jacobsson no longer to ques-
 tion the principle of unconditional surrender, though at one point they
 asked whether unconditional military and naval surrender might not
 be sufficient.  On his own initiative Jacobsson replied that such a pro-
 posal would not be acceptable to the Allies but would be considered
 merely a quibble.17  Both Japanese officials raised the question of
 maintaining Japanese territorial integrity, but they apparently did not
 mean to include Manchukuo, Korea or Formosa.
 Throughout discussions with Jacobsson,  the Japanese officials
 stressed only two points: (a) the preservation of the Emperor, and
 (b) the possibility of returning to the constitution promulgated in
 1889.  Kitamura prepared and presented to Jacobsson a memorandum
 asking him to sound out Mr. Dulles' opinion on the two points.
 (Mr. Dulles feels that these two Japanese are insisting on the
 retention of the Emperor because they feel that he alone can take
 '" Umezu was actually one of the bitter-enders wanting to the last to give battle
 to the invaders on home soil.  He, with War Minister Anami and Naval Chief of
 Staff Toyoda, were brought into line with the "peace group" only by the inter-
 vention of the Emperor on 10 and again on 14 August.
 " But this quibble, incorporated on 26 July into the Potsdam proclamation,
 became an important argument for accepting the surrender terms.

 effective action with respect to surrender and that some hope of
 survival must be held out to him in order to gain his support for
 unconditional surrender.)
 Later Yoshimura and Kitamura prepared a second memorandum in
 which they asked how, if Tokyo were ready to proceed, conversations
 could be arranged with Allied representatives and what form of
 authorization would be required.
 Jacobsson is personally convinced that these approaches are serious
 and that the Japanese group in Switzerland is in constant cable con-
 tact with Tokyo.18  This conviction appears to be based on impres-
 sions only, since his two Japanese contacts never stated precisely
 that they had received instructions from any authorized agency in
 Tokyo.
 (Mr. Dulles, in carefully guarded statements, pointed out to Jacobs-
 son that:
 (1. Mr. Grew's statement of 10 July covered the situation.  As yet
 these approaches which Jacobsson described, in the absence of con-
 clusive evidence that they emanated from a fully-empowered official,
 fall squarely into the category of "peace feelers" described by Mr.
 Grew. 19
 (2. If competent Japanese authorities accepted unconditional sur-
 render, appropriate Allied authorities would determine how such
 a surrender should be effected.
 (3. He (Mr. Dulles) had no comments to make with regard to
 dynastic and constitutional questions.20
 (4. Prompt unconditional surrender appears to be the only way to
 save anything out of the wreckage.
 Okamoto and Kase sent many cables (in which they, like Fujimura, apparently
 implied that the initiative for the contact had come from Mr. Dulles), but the
 only encouragement they got from Tokyo was the lack of any rebuke.
 "? "Conversations relating to peace have been reported to the Department from
 various parts of the world, but in no case has an approach been made .. . by a
 person who could establish his authority to speak for the Japanese Govern-
 ment. . . .  The purported `peace feelers' .   . are the usual moves in the
 conduct of psychological warfare by a defeated enemy."
 '? But according to Butow's information from the postwar testimony of Kase,
 Yoshimura, and Kitamura, Mr. Dulles' reply as relayed by Jacobsson had been
 that the United States was not opposed to preserving the imperial institution but
 had to take its allies' views into account and so could not make any firm com-
 mitment.  It could state its "understanding" that the imperial system would be
 retained. The constitution, however, would have to be changed.

 heart the consequences which Germany has suffered, including ex
 tensive physical destruction and the collapse of all German authority
 because it prolonged a futile struggle many months after its hope
 lessness was wholly apparent.  Jacobsson feels therefore that
 tendency is growing in certain Japanese circles to try to terminatf
 the war at any cost, provided that non-militaristic Japanese govern
 mental institutions can be preserved in the Japanese home islands
 (Mr. Dulles expects within a few days to obtain some evidence
 as to whether these approaches by Yoshimura and Kitamura have any
 serious backing or represent merely an effort by the Japanese group
 in Switzerland to start something on their own initiative.)
 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 18 July :1945
 Mr. Dulles has been informed by OSS representatives in Switzer-
 land that Yoshimura and Kojiro Kitamura, Japanese official; in the
 Bank for International Settlements, were scheduled to confer at once
 with Brigadier General Kiyotomi Okamoto at Zurich, and immediately
 thereafter to cable Tokyo. .. .
 (Mr. Dulles believes that for the next few days important de-
 velopments in this matter are not likely, but that a line is being
 opened which the Japanese may use when the situation in Tokyo
 permits Japan to accept unconditional surrender.)
 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
 2 August 1945
 Immediately following is a summary of a report by Per Jacobsson,
 a Swedish national and economic adviser to the Bank for International
 Settlements, transmitted to Mr. Dulles through an intermediary:
 The Japanese Chief of Staff has acknowledged without comment a
 long cable which Brigadier General Kiyotomi Okamoto sent. from
 Switzerland on 19 July.  Okamoto's telegram reportedly stated that
 Japan has lost the war and must promptly accept the conse-
 quences... .

 The Japanese Foreign Minister has also acknowledged a detailed
 report from Shunichi Kase, Japanese Minister in Bern.  Kase's re-
 port, sent on or about 21 July, included (a) Mr. Grew's statement
 of 10 July, (b) a memorandum from Kojiro Kitamura, director of
 the Bank for International Settlements and former financial attache
 in Berlin, who has been active in the current Japanese approaches to
 Mr. Dulles, and (c) a statement of Kase's own position.  The Foreign
 Minister's reply to Kase's message contained the following query:
 "Is that all you have to say?"  Kase interprets this query as an
 invitation to continue peace approaches.
 The recent tripartite ultimatum to Japan 21 has been the chief topic
 of discussion among Japanese groups in Switzerland.    Their first re-
 action, on the basis of excerpts published in the Swiss press, was
 that (a) the proclamation showed a lack of understanding of Japa-
 nese character, (b) the document should have not been framed on
 a basis of "take it or leave it," (c) the inclusion of China as a
 signatory represented an "added element of humiliation," and (d)
 the document should have been sent through private channels rather
 than publicly.  After receiving the full English text through Jacobs-
 son, and after further study, the attitude of the group changed, and
 the proclamation was accepted as an "astute document which left a
 possible way out."  The group was particularly impressed by "un-
 conditional surrender" in connection with the "Japanese armed forces"
 and to the reference to revival and strengthening of democratic
 tendencies among the Japanese people.  As a result, a telegram stress-
 ing these points was to be sent to Tokyo on 30 July.
 The following is a summary of a memorandum to Mr. Dulles from
 the Japanese group in contact with Per Jacobsson.  Jacobsson trans-
 mitted this memo along with his own report summarized above.
 The Japanese group emphasizes that it is hoping for some decision
 within a week unless "resistance is too great."  The Allies should not
 take "too seriously" what was said over the Tokyo radio about the
 tripartite proclamation.22  This radio comment was merely "propa-
 The Potsdam proclamation.
 22 It .had been formally decided at cabinet level to withhold public comment
 on the proclamation while seeking clarification through Soviet good offices.  But
 this decision was somehow twisted in the next day's press and radio into one to
 show "silent contempt" for the tripartite terms, and then Premier Suzuki, under
 pressure from the military, confirmed this interpretation.

 ganda to maintain morale in Japan."  The real reply will be given
 through some "official channel," possibly by Minister Kase or General
 Okamoto, if an official Government reply is not made over the
 Tokyo radio.
 Mr. Dulles also has been informed, by a German authority on the
 Far. East living in Switzerland who is one of his regular contacts,
 that Yosikazu 23 Fujimura, a Japanese Navy representative in Bern,
 has sent seven long cables to his superiors in Tokyo during the past
 two months urging immediate cessation of hostilities.  His superiors
 cabled in reply that the Japanese Navy no longer is able to "act
 alone," and instructed Fujimura not to take the initiative without
 orders from Tokyo, but to maintain his "most valuable contacts." 24
 The German source reports and Jacobsson confirms that Fu.jimura
 and Kitamura have established close contact with each other.  The
 two men, Jacobsson confirms, are agreed that joint action by all Japa-
 nese services in Switzerland might make some impression on the
 Japanese Government, since Bern now "is probably next to Moscow
 the most important Japanese foreign post."

 as given over the Tokyo Radio by Premier Suzuki.  They attribute
 the terseness of the reply as evidence of the influence of a "peace
 party."
 This group in Switzerland has been sending daily cables to Tokyo
 stating that the Potsdam declaration to Japan was merely a simple
 statement of Allied war aims and not a "take-it-or-leave-it ultimatum
 which Japan could not honorably accept, as was first believed."  The
 group feels that these daily messages to Tokyo have served to bolster
 the efforts of the "peace Party" in Tokyo.  The group finds encourag-
 ing the fact that it has not been rebuked for such frank statements,
 and attaches considerable importance to a report in the Swiss press
 on 5 August that Foreign Minister Togo was received in private
 audience by the Emperor.25  The group considers that Togo belongs
 to "a new peace party."
 The group requested Jacobsson to ask Mr. Dulles whether he would
 be willing to see an authorized representative of the Japanese Gov-
 ernment.  If so, one of the following would be selected as the repre-
 sentative: (1) Minister Kase, acting as Japanese Government delegate
 to the conversations, not as Minister to Switzerland; (2) Ambassador
 Sato in Moscow; or preferably (3) some Swiss civilian now in Tokyo
 who could be sent under the cover of a representative of the Inter-
 national Red Cross.  The group prefers the third alternative because
 it feels that such a person would know the situation in Tokyo and
 "would evaluate the situation as envisaged in Europe."
 Mr. Dulles comments that there is no direct evidence that these
 suggestions from the Japanese group in Switzerland are based on
 instructions from Tokyo.  Mr. Dulles has again cautioned Jacobsson
 on this point and has emphasized to Jacobsson that the only ques-
 tion is whether the Japanese are ready to accept unconditional sur-
 render as set forth in the Potsdam and other previous official declara-
 tions.  Realizing the extreme delicacy of this matter, Mr. Dulles con-
 tinues to handle it with the greatest caution.

 attempt to approach Allied authorities through OSS representa-
 tives.  . . .
 On 17 August, Per Jacobsson transmitted the following information
 to Mr. Dulles:
 Brigadier General Kiyotomi Okamoto, believed to be head of Japa-
 nese intelligence in Europe until his suicide 15 August, received a
 telegram just before his death from the Japanese Chief of Staff,
 thanking him and his associates in Bern for their work in communicat-
 ing with "the Americans" in Switzerland.  The wire stated that their
 work in Switzerland had been most useful in enabling Tokyo to
 reach a decision.
 (Mr. Dulles comments that the Navy and civilian groups were pre-
 pared to seek peace before the Army had come to such a decision.
 The initiation of formal peace offers therefore was blocked until some-
 one in the Army group came out in favor of surrender.) 26
 After receiving the message, General Okamoto wrote Fujimura
 asking him to express thanks to Jacobsson and Mr. Dulles.  In rec-
 ognition of his work, Jacobsson is to be entertained by both Fujimura
 and Kitamura.  Jacobsson feels that the Japanese in Bern must have
 been praised by Tokyo for their work.
 In his messages to Tokyo prior to the Japanese surrender, General
 Okamoto had insisted that his government should deal solely with
 the United States.  Jacobsson believes it is likely that the suggestions
 of the Japanese in Bern "persuaded the Emperor finally to turn to
 the United States alone."  The Swiss group, inspired by Jacobsson,
 suggested the face-saving formula that avoided the use of the word
 "surrender" in Japanese official communications.27
 Before he died, General Okamoto collected all of Fujimura's letters
 and other pertinent papers and directed that they be saved for his-
 torians' use.  Jacobsson learned from Fujimura that immediately after
 General Okamoto's death, the Japanese Chief of Staff sent Okamoto's
 "military office" in Bern a message of condolence.  The message ap-
 parently was not a mere formality, since it was much longer than
 customary and included the following sentence: "I appreciate his
 patriotic service rendered at our country's most critical moment."
 "But Okamoto's coming out in favor of surrender had had no evident effect
 on Army circles in Tokyo.  See note 16 above.
 'To judge from Butow's study, the cables from Switzerland commanded little
 attention in Tokyo.

 A new contract agent wins his spurs
 and reports with conviction that-
 Fujimura and Kitamura regard this action as expressing approval and
 appreciation of the General's last telegrams advocating surrender.
 Shunichi Kase, Japanese Minister in Bern, decided in July that he
 had been wrong in favoring the USSR as the intermediary for peace
 negotiations.  He radioed Tokyo that the Soviet Union was not a
 satisfactory channel and that the wisest course would be to deal
 directly with the United States through Swiss contacts.
 Jacobsson believes that, because of the above, the Japanese Gov-
 ernment elected to send the final surrender communication through
 Bern.  Stockholm, he points out, would have served as well and
 would have been the normal transmittal point since the USSR, by
 then at war, had diplomatic representatives in the Swedish capital.28
 1 The surrender notes were communicated to Britain and the USSR through
 the Swedish government, to the United States and China through the Swiss.
 TRAINING PAYS
 James A. Savacool
 The following are excerpts from a contract agent's report on his
 successful operations in a denied area.  He had been arrested, to
 be sure, but only in the course of a mass roundup of potentially sub-
 versive elements, and his security had been so good that after about
 eight weeks he was released for lack of evidence.  His report shows
 the possibility as well as the difficulty of operating under severe
 counterintelligence controls and above all the value of thorough train-
 ing.  Experienced intelligence operatives may find the lessons herein
 illustrated a bit elementary, but this agent is understandably sold on
 the value of those elementary lessons and proud of having learned
 them well and followed them.
 I am altogether convinced that I managed to evade detection be-
 cause of the thorough teaching in tradecraft I was given by my
 instructors, particularly Al, with his insistence on careful planning
 and close attention to every detail regardless of how small or in-
 consequential it might appear.
 Meetings
 Because of the close surveillance to which all persons living under
 the block system of neighborhood control are subject, meetings and
 meeting places were the problem of primary concern.  Meetings just
 to transfer material or funds were comparatively simple; the main
 essential was coordinated timing.  There was no telephone number
 that could be called for the exact time, but a local radio station gave
 the hour on the minute.  We used this to synchronize our watches.
 Our unalterable rule was, "Never before the hour and never more
 than three minutes after the hour." If contact was not made in that
 interval it was deferred to an alternative time and place.  In a full
 year of such meetings we had to resort to the alternative only two
 or three times.
 We soon discovered that Al's advice about woo cover for status
 and for action was right, that it was much easier to devise a reason

 for being who and where we were and doing what we were doing
 if members of the opposite sex were involved. So wherever possible
 we arranged to have a woman as cutout, and the cover for a meeting
 with her would be simply a lovers' tryst. We met in bars and
 restaurants and, seemingly by chance, in areas normally frequented
 by both parties.  Meetings without a cutout were held only when
 absolutely unavoidable, as when planning the details of a sabotage
 project.
 When such direct contact had to be made, we generally followed
 this basic outline: The time and place, plus the alternate plan, were
 passed by the cutout.   We used code words for the meeting places
 and a plus or minus number of hours.  At the appointed hour one
 of the two parties would be, let's say, at a bus stop in a fairly busy
 section of town, with an appropriate cover for "status."  The cover
 for action was almost invariably the other's offer to give him a ride
 home.  Cover for their acquaintance was generally a former pupil-
 teacher relationship.  Neither person carried documents to these
 meetings.  Information was given orally and no notes were taken.
 The writing up was done immediately after the meeting when safely
 at home.
 Staying Inconspicuous
 Every effort was made to avoid both deserted sections and exces-
 sively busy areas.              Al's maxim "Know the area" became a way of life.
 In my area, which was quite large, I knew the location of security
 forces, where government officials lived, and where foreigners of
 consequence were to be found.  How important this knowledge is
 was impressed on me one time when I parked my car in an un-
 fortunate spot to go to a meeting.              It happened like this:
 Returning to my car after the meeting, I recalled Al's reiterated
 "Always have a cover story."  I truthfully did not believe there was
 any need for a cover story at this point, but just to follow the rujes
 I prepared one.  It was not a well-planned cover; certainly it could
 not compare with those I prepared after that:  But it was a story.
 I knew a teacher who lived about a block from where I had parked
 my car.  I went by his house and spent a few minutes there before
 going back to the parking place.  As soon as I got to the car and
 opened the door about five spotlights went on and I was surrounded
 by militiamen.  They searched me and the car, made me identify
 self and asked what I was doing there.  Since I was prepared,
 I could tell my story readily and convincingly, and it had enough
 truth in it to get by.
 I learned later that a high government official had moved that
 very day into the house in front of which I had parked.  Close!  A
 good object lesson, and an extremely convincing one.  Al was right:
 "Have a cover story at all times, for if you don't you may panic and
 trap yourself."
 Regular Sessions
 Tutoring sessions were used as a cover for regular meetings.   The
 "pupil" was supposed to be taking English lessons from me at my
 house.  I supplied him with books, gave him a list of things we would
 have covered in the last session, had him do under my supervision
 a paper to be handed in as homework, and gave him another list
 of items to be covered in the current session.  He always arrived
 carrying several books to use in the lesson, and he would enclose
 in them any papers necessary for the meeting.   We drew up a class
 schedule for twice a week and had a reason why he had not been
 able to attend his last class if we had not met then.  If he was there
 off schedule he was making up a session he had missed.  While our
 meetings were in progress I played a tape recording of English read-
 ings to give more realism to the cover and also to preclude any eaves-
 dropping on our conversation.
 This attention to detail made it possible for me to meet with one
 of my contacts countless times, though the block warden might be
 standing in front of the house watching us.  Thoroughness in detail
 had been one of the fundamentals drilled into me by all my in-
 structors, and in practice it paid off.
 Caution with New Contact
 One afternoon I received a call from my case officer asking me to
 come immediately to a restaurant.  When I arrived he told me we
 were meeting a student who he believed had good potential as a
 political agent.  The case officer was leaving the -country, and I
 would have to handle this man on my own.  He was energetic, ap-
 parently well acquainted, and anxious to do something against the
 government; but he needed some financial aid to continue in the
 university.  I was to give him $200 and explore the possibility of his
 working for us.

 The student arrived and I was introduced to him, by a first name
 only. I invited him to take a walk with me and talk about his activi-
 ties.  He was very enthusiastic.  He told me he had organized about
 300 students but they needed arms.  He wanted me to get him
 weapons, gelatin, etc.  I pleaded ignorance in all such matters.  Then
 he began asking questions.  He asked me where I lived.  I gave him
 the name of a suburb favored by Americans.  He asked if I had a
 car. I told him no, that was one of my problems; living in the
 suburbs and working down town I lost quite a bit of time. He wanted
 to know bow long I had been in the country, etc.
 Then he turned to describing the "active" groups at the univer-
 sity.  He seemed thoroughly conversant with the membership of
 these groups.  When I inquired which one he belonged to he said
 he was an independent.  He cooperated with several groups in
 sabotage undertakings, but he preferred to remain unattached; it
 gave him more chance to act.  I just listened, carefully.  I asl?Ced
 him where he could meet me so that I could give him the tuition
 money.  He was very grateful for our helping him continue his
 studies; he would always cherish the memory of our friendship for
 the "little" people, the real people of his country.  Could I meet him
 at such-and-such a corner tomorrow at 2:00 p.m.?      "Of course; would
 you like the money in big bills or small?"  "Twenties would be per-
 feet," he said.
 All the information he had elicited from me was of course false.
 I really don't know why I went to such pains to lie so plausibly, even
 adding little anecdotes about my troubles with public transportation
 during the rush hour.  I presume it was the oft-repeated admonition
 of my instructors to let my contacts know as little of me as possible.
 The added trimmings to induce belief were probably just instinct,
 quickened by the knowledge that two Americans had recently been
 seized in the area of our rendezvous.

 the son's name on it.  He was then to leave immediately, taking pre-
 cautions against being followed.  The courier did exactly as di-
 rected and reported back that no one except the mother had been
 in the store.
 In the meantime I had started a check on my new would-be friend,
 asking the head of one of the activist groups at the university to look
 into him.  He returned mystified; my friend was unknown to anyone
 in his group.  Was I sure of the name and school?  I verified these
 and asked him to try again.  At the same time I started another
 investigation through a second group.  The results were the same:
 subject unknown; their security suspected counterintelligence.
 I now alerted both groups and gave them the names of the people
 the man had mentioned as members.  They were appalled that
 counterintelligence was onto these, their top echelon at the univer-
 sity.  One of them muttered it might be a good idea if the man
 got in the way of a bus.  I heard later that he died under mysterious
 circumstances; I don't know what happened to him.
 A regretful postscript is that at the time of the mass arrests they
 picked up an American citizen, fluent in the local language, who lived
 in the suburb I had named, had no car, and worked down town.
 They interrogated him frequently and at odd hours--at lunch or
 supper time so he wouldn't get anything to eat, in the middle of the
 night, etc.  My story held up all too well in the absence of ident fica-
 tion by the dead man.
 Security Behind Bars
 A big headache was caching materials.  My house had a tile :floor,
 and any attempt to loosen a tile would be fatal.  There is no way
 to conceal its looseness.  At the time of the mass roundup the house
 was searched tile by tile; light fixtures were taken down from the
 ceiling; the hi-fi cabinet was taken apart and examined minutely;
 every piece of clothing was processed; the bathroom was torn up;
 even the little tank on the roof for maintaining water pressure was
 examined and measured.     The only item they missed was a breakfast
 table.
 This was a standard formica-top table with tubular aluminum legs.
 During the first search my data was hidden in one of the legs.  Im-
 mediately afterward I destroyed it, but they overlooked the table
 again in the second search.  I don't know whether they thought of
 Provocation Deflected
 The immediate problem was this prospective meeting with a person
 who had been handed to me as a promising contact but whom I
 had not checked.  My solution was this: I called one of my con-
 tacts of university age and gave him an envelope containing the
 money.  I told him that at exactly 2:00 p.m., when my new contact
 would be standing on a corner five miles away, he was to enter a
 kiosque this man's parents owned and hand them the envelope with

 it in later searches, for I was taken to jail immediately after the
 second one.
 When he trained me, Al insist?d that I use a safety signal rather than
 a danger signal.  I put that system into effect with my contacts, in-
 structing them never to approach me but just make this safe sign.
 One day shortly after I was sent to prison I saw one of my contacts
 in the yard.  I suspected I was under observation and was afraid
 he might involve both of us by recognizing me.  He followed the
 rule, however, and when he gave the safety signal I walked away.
 :[ waited my chance and one day managed to sit next to him at
 lunch.  Then I could tell him that as far as I knew I was in the
 clear, merely having been picked up in the mass arrests.  He said
 his case was the same.  That made it much easier to sleep at night.
 I cautioned him against making friends in prison and urged him to
 sit tight and confine his conversation, even with those he believed to
 he friends, to generalities.  From then on we saw each other regu-
 larly in the prison yard but did not so much as exchange a wink.
 Seeds of Success
 The prisoners were all curious about the reasons why their fellows
 were in jail.  In concocting an answer for them I recalled the advice
 I had been given, to think in case of capture about taking a lesser
 rap.  So I began laying the groundwork for a lesser charge.  I fig-
 ured that if I was known to believe I had been jailed for a particular
 reason, the police just might tend to investigate that reason rather
 than another.  So when asked why I was arrested I would say, "I
 think they are accusing me of hoarding," and explain how when they
 searched my house the police had found quite a bit of soap and
 probably thought I was black-marketing that scarce item.  I took
 good care not to mention any specific amount of soap; I didn't want to
 make the case against me too good.  I do not know how effective
 this story was as a red herring, but the fact remains that I was never
 questioned and was eventually released.
 Thus I believe it was the training I received that permitted me to
 operate without detection and provided me, when picked up in the
 mass arrests, with the resources to weather the danger and elude
 any traps the secret police had set.  I was glad my instructors had
 insisted on a cover story; had I not had one the first time I was
 stopped and questioned, I would have had no need for any sub-

 introduced him, saved me from an evident disaster.  The value of a
 safety signal was brought home when I was able to warn off my
 contact in the prison without any telltale gesture. And being well
 schooled in what to do under arrest, I did not panic but was able
 to form a plan under which I could have maintained my innocence
 of everything except having amassed eight or ten bars of soap at home.

 THE OKHRANA'S FEMALE AGENTS
 PART II: Indigenous Recruits '
 Rita T. Kronenbitter
 From the early stages of its existence the Okhrana adhered to a
 firm policy of strictly segregating its truly clandestine services.  It
 divided agents into two categories, "external" and "internal," mean-
 ing roughly overt and covert respectively.  The external agents were
 investigators.  They did open and clandestine surveillance and a
 variety of detective work, including cooperation with other govern-
 ment security agencies at home and abroad.  Whether known to the
 public as Okhrana employees or not, they were officially recognized
 within the government and paid overtly by it.  The internal service,
 in contrast, was essentially a system of penetrations and thus by
 necessity completely secret.  Its personnel were unknown not only
 to the public and other government agencies but for the most part
 to Okhrana officers themselves.  The identity of its agents was masked
 even in the operational files recording their activities.  Each was
 known personally only to his case officer and, usually, the chief of
 the unit he worked for; agents did not know of one another's
 existence.
 Similarly no external agent was ever supposed to know an internal
 one, who would normally be operating under some revolutionary
 cover.  So strictly was this rule enforced that an external agent who
 learned the identity of an internal agent would be dismissed.  Thus
 it often happened that it was the duty of an external agent to mount
 surveillance on an internal agent ostensibly working for a subversive
 group.  One obvious advantage of this circumstance was to provide
 a multiple check on the veracity and dependability of the penetration

 agents, a number of whom turned out to be playing a double role;
 but this was just a side benefit from the compartmentation practiced
 for the sake of the internal agents' security.
 The principle of two separate categories of agents lent itself
 remarkably well to the operating problems of the Okhrana stations
 abroad.  The first chief in Paris, Petr Ivanovich Rachkovsky (he held
 the post from 1884 to 1902), soon realized that external agents of
 Russian nationality were totally unsuitable for work in western Europe.
 Not just their language but their very appearance and behavior gave
 them away immediately.  Gradually, therefore, all the Russian in-
 vestigators were returned home and replaced by French, Italian, Ger-
 man, and British agents.            The Okhrana abroad thus reinforced the
 functional dichotomy of the two agent categories with an ethnic one:
 foreigners, recruited largely from among host government and private
 detectives, became the investigators, while agents from Russia were
 devoted to penetration operations against the revolutionaries.
 In the fall of 1913, however, most of Paris Okhrana's external,
 investigation agents were exposed by the revolutionaries' counter-
 intelligence.        In the ensuing upheaval former investigator Jollivet
 was suddenly transformed into a penetration agent inside the revolu-
 tionary service.  Paris Okhrana found it expedient also to be flexible
 in the use of an array of mistresses of Monsieur Henri Bint.
 The Women of Henri Bint
 This Alsatian gentleman, hired by Rachkovsky in 1885 after ten
 years of service with the French Surete, remained one of the Paris
 station's principal investigators until the first world war.  (During
 the war the Okhrana took him off routine investigation work and
 supplied him with funds to establish a residence in Switzerland,
 from where he could get agents into Germany and Austria.  The Swiss
 imprisoned him in January 1917.)  Apparently he never married,
 but he was never without mistresses, one at a time after he had
 learned quite early that it was neither healthy nor economical to
 have two or more together.
 Life on the Riviera
 Another thing Bint learned was to avail himself of the help his
 mistresses could render in connection with his job.  In 1912, as leader
 of a surveillance network on the Riviera, he took along a mistress
 and loaned her free of charge both to a youn Yer agent of his network

 named Fontana and to officers of the French and Italian police de-
 partments cooperating with him.  This generosity led on one occasion
 to a serious contretemps.  The mistress, staying with Fontana at a
 hotel in La Spezia, stole from his suitcase a batch of photographs and
 letters and gave them to a cooperating Italian agent, and there ensued
 a fist fight in one of the city's public squares.  The police interfered,
 the press got interested, and there were provocative stories in French
 and Italian newspapers.  Bint, although it was not entirely his fault,
 received a stern reprimand from the chief.
 Bint had been dismissed from the Okhrana on two occasions, pri-
 marily on account of indecorous relations with the fair sex, but !both
 times he was promptly rehired.  The chiefs valued his professional
 skill and realized that he occasionally got results from his mistresses'
 peeping into the activities of unreliable Russian aristocrats in Paris.
 Although a French demoiselle could not understand what the Russians
 were saying among themselves, she could keep company with in-
 dividual conspirators, who could all speak some French.  By using
 his girls Bint thus became more than a mere detective; the information
 they procured was almost in the category of that from internal agents.
 Understandably enough, however, the system gradually wore out:
 the revolutionaries became wary of Parisian female companions.  Then
 in 1911, when Bint's colleague Leroi defected from the Okhrana to
 join Burtzev's revolutionary counterintelligence, Bint had to cut off
 all espieglerie with the females, as the practice was called.   Bint
 and Leroi had worked together for years against the same targets.,
 using the same techniques and often sharing mistresses for whatever
 job was on hand.  No one cursed Leroi so much as Bint for his
 defection; he knew he would tell Burtzev all about it.  He even
 anticipated that on Leroi's advice Burtzev would sooner or later try
 the trick on him, hiring some female to work on him.  And so he did.
 Tables Turned
 Liubov Julia was a Parisian whose first name suggested Russian
 origin.  The use of Julia as a surname was most likely her own inven-
 tion.                                                                                                               When Bint first saw her, in a public cafe, she was with a
 group of revolutionaries, but she seemed much too frivolous and
 gay to be concerned with politics or conspiracies.  She acted. like
 any ordinary Parisian demimondaine of the period.   He made her
 acquaintance and found that she was just as jolly in his company
 as she had seemed among the Russian intellectuals.  At the moment

 he was not particularly tied to any mistress, so he took her home
 with him, and there she stayed.
 This was early 1913.  He reported in full to his Okhrana superiors.
 His case officer thought that Julia might prove useful in work among
 the revolutionaries, cables and dispatches were exchanged with
 Petersburg headquarters, and Julia was hired under the code name
 "Jourdain."  She was to receive 100 francs a month for reporting to
 Bint on several groups of conspirators in Paris.
 Thus there happened to Bint what he was afraid would happen:
 he had a mistress spy on him just as he had used mistresses to spy
 on others.   Julia was Burtzev's plant.  She would regularly bring
 Bint quantities of attractive information, all written in her own hand,
 which always turned out to be of little or no value to the Okhrana.
 Bint's case officer, who had reports about Julia's activities from other
 sources, soon decided that she ought to be able to produce much
 better intelligence.  Gradually it was possible to check the sources
 of the information she delivered, and it was discovered that all of it
 was prepared by Burtzev's counterintelligence people.
 Just about this time Julia suddenly came forth with a demand for
 500 francs in cash, threatening to sue Bint and expose him in the
 French press.  She was dismissed at once.  In the lengthy explana-
 tions dispatched to headquarters toward the end of 1913, the Paris
 station maintained that Julia could not possibly have gained access
 to any information about the Okhrana and could not even have
 supplied Burtzev with any knowledge about Bint except the fact of
 his physical association with her.
 Burtzev and Leroi had had even less success in an earlier, some-
 what dissimilar attempt.  In 1908 Henri Bint made the acquaintance
 of Lea Chauvin, and she stayed in his apartment, on and off, collaborat-
 ing in his professional work, for some three years until in 1911, shortly
 after Leroi's defection, Bint was called to Petersburg.  It was not
 customary to bring non-Russian external agents to headquarters, but
 he, as the most important sleuth of three decades and chief manager
 of the network of detectives, was made an exception.     The consulta-
 tion with him was to include some training, which would entail his
 absence from Paris for many weeks, possibly two or three months.
 By age, Bint could have been Lea's grandfather.        Although he
 always preferred young girls, this affair had lasted much longer than

 usual and his leaving for Petersburg seemed a good occasion to close
 it off.  He told the girl that it would be sensible for her to find some-
 one more suitable to her age.  But she did not want to be sensible.
 She refused to leave; she would stay in the apartment and wait for
 his return.  Bint would not have it.  There were several rough
 scenes, and when she still refused to go he had to call the police to
 make her get out.
 Lea was in a fighting, vengeful mood.  She would never have
 obeyed Bint's order to leave; the ingrate had to call the police to
 throw her out.  That was what she told Leroi, who somehow learned
 of her distress and promptly called on her to offer consolation.  Leroi
 of course knew all about Lea's life with Bint. He himself had always
 had a soft spot for her, but now she might have information about
 Bint's recent activities and the purpose of his trip to Petersburg.  In
 this emotional state she even seemed a good prospect for agent
 work--well motivated and familiar with Bint's contacts and operations.
 After much talk about his friendship and understanding for her
 feelings, Leroi persuaded Lea to visit Burtzev's office.  She was ready
 for anything as long as it meant hurting Bint, and Burtzev and Leroi
 found it easy to recruit her for intelligence work against Bin! and
 against the Okhrana that had taken him away from her.  Leroi's
 enthusiasm for the prospective operation was probably enhanced by
 his fondness for Lea, but Burtzev trusted his judgment.   He had made
 him chief investigator in all operations against the Okhrana's non-
 Russian networks.
 For a short time Lea became as much devoted to Leroi as she had
 been to Bint, but soon she seemed to have developed some second
 thoughts.  Who can tell what was really in her mind?  Maybe she
 thought she could reawaken the affections of her dear old Bint when
 he returned, or perhaps she developed an aversion to the rather
 uncouth and frequently drunk Leroi.  Whatever the reason, after
 everything was agreed and she was to become an agent of the revolu-
 tionary counterintelligence, she secretly went to see the chief of Paris
 Okhrana, Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Krassilnikov.  Yet this was just
 a probing action; all she did was complain,about how Bint had thrown
 her out on the street.  In relaying her story to headquarters, Krassil-
 nikov wrote that he had given her 500 francs to keep her quiet and
 recover from her a packet of Bint's personal letters which she had
 appropriated to use just in case.

 Lea was astonished by the 500 francs.  She had never had that
 much money in her hand before.  She became bemused with the
 possibilities of earning more; she had already observed that the
 revolutionary intelligence office was short of funds.  So she made a
 second visit to Krassilnikov, and this time she told him all about how
 Burtzev and Leroi had recruited her to work for them and assured
 her of a steady income.  She said she did not trust Leroi, he had
 deserted his friend Bint, and he would desert her the same way.
 Finally she offered her services to Krassilnikov, saying that she knew
 from living with Bint and helping him just what she would have to
 do to be useful.
 A case officer was assigned, and soon thereafter Lea's reports were
 being dispatched to headquarters under the code name ` L'heros."
 The Okhrana instructed her to stay on the job in Burtzev's office and
 report on every assignment she received.  At first it was just de-
 briefings: one lengthy report on a luncheon with Burtzcv and Leroi
 told of pressing questions on the current whereabouts of Harting,
 former Paris Okhrana chief, and hundreds of questions on the orders
 received by Bint, the times and places he would meet with Okhrana
 officers, his non-Russian affiliates, and his methods for receiving pay
 and instructions and submitting reports.  As a double agent working
 in Burtzev's office with the position of assistant to Leroi, she was
 paid 200 francs a month by the Okhrana.
 Mime. Chauvin, as she was introduced to visiting revolutionaries in
 Burtzev's office, delighted her chiefs there by her willingness to be
 of use, though she was disappointingly ill acquainted with the opera-
 tional information they wanted.  Burtzev decided to use her in other
 operations.  Once Leroi took her to Place Bouveau, in front of the
 Ministry of the Interior and the Sicrete Generale, gave her a camera,
 and told her to take pictures of a man he would point out leaving the
 building.  This project of Leroi's was soon brought to the attention of
 the Okhrana liaison officer in the Surete, M. Moreau, chief of the politi-
 cal police who, it happened, was the man whose picture Leroi wanted.
 Another time Leroi took her to a lawyer named Tomasini, who she
 found out later was a naturalized Frenchman of Russian origin.  The
 two wanted a statement from her to the effect that Bint had been
 receiving from the Monyjeux District post office a number of letters

 addressed to Russian revolutionaries.  (Burtzev repeatedly tried to
 prove that Paris postal officials were selling revolutionary correspond-
 ence to the Okhrana.)  Lea replied that she knew nothing of any
 such mail being given to Bint.  They pleaded with her for a long
 time to write and sign such a deposition.  Though they offered her
 1,000 francs cash and the assurance of 200 francs a month for the
 rest of her life, according to her report forwarded in a dispatch to
 Petersburg, she answered only that she could not affirm what she did
 not know.
 Dispatches to Petersburg in the Paris Okhrana files show that
 L'heros continued as a double agent until the outbreak of the war.
 Her pay was increased to 275 francs a month, delivered to her regu-
 larly by Bint, who on his return became her case officer, nothing
 more this time.
 Jane
 Marcel Bittard-Monin, supervisor of most of Paris Okhrana's non-
 Russian agents, made Mme. G. Richard Le Davadie sign five papers
 relating to the termination of her service.  She was furious.  The
 smooth talk with which the goaty Lothario tried to cheer her in her
 misery only enraged her more; he was taking the side of the Russian
 bosses.  She didn't give a damn, she said, what new twists they were
 taking in their policy.  She could not care less whether they con-
 formed to the attitude of the French government.  What she wanted
 and needed was the job they were taking away.
 She felt cheated by this sudden deprivation not only of income
 but of everything she had enjoyed for a half dozen interesting years
 of spying-first for Bittard personally and then for the Okhrana
 behind him.  She had had tours at the best times of year to the Cote
 d'Azur and the Italian Riviera, all expenses paid.  In the endless
 variety of tasks that she performed she had earned much praise,
 which always made her feel happy, useful, and young again.  The
 job had become part of her; she truly believed that the Russian
 service could never find anyone more willing to work and to sacrifice
 herself when necessary.  She knew, and the Okhrana bosses must
 know, that no male detective could replace her.  They could tail
 the conspirators to the gates of their residences; she could follow
 them., if need be, into their bedrooms.

 When these arguments proved of no avail, Mme. Le Davadie turned
 to Bittard-Monin with personal reproaches.  No other agent he was
 dismissing had ever meant anything to him, while she had been his
 favorite before either of them had ever heard of the Okhrana.  She
 recalled how she had shared with him her apartment and all in those
 young and idealistic years when he was struggling along as a poorly
 paid sub-inspector for the Surete.  The ingrate would hear none of it;
 his heart had turned to stone.    Aside from the change of policy, he
 reminded her coldly, the agents had to be dismissed for the obvious
 reason that they had all been blown by Burtzev and their names
 published in all the press of Europe, so they would be entirely useless.
 "Why aren't you fired, then?" she came back.  "Your name was
 not only in the newspapers, but proclaimed in parliament."
 He said he would be, reiterating that the Okhrana was discontinuing
 operations and making a public announcement to that effect.  He
 declared that part of the reason for this was to insure the safety of
 the agents whose names and addresses were now known to the
 terrorists.  But he did not convince her.  The argument degenerated
 into repetition and name-calling.
 Finally Mme. Le Davadie saw that it was no use and signed the
 five papers.  First was a receipt for 200 francs, her salary for the
 last month, and one for expense money and a termination bonus.
 Then there was the notarized resignation:
 The undersigned Madame Richard Le Davadie, residing at 52 rue Jacob,
 employed by the intelligence service organized and directed by Monsieur
 Marcel Bittard-Monin, am hereby resigning from said service as a result of
 its complete dissolution as of 31 October 1913.
 I have received as indemnity the sum of 200 francs, the equivalent of
 one month's salary.
 I declare that I am entirely satisfied with the payment of said sum as
 my final compensation.

 Another paper acknowledged that she had been returned her birth
 certificate and a court document concerning herself.                  By her fifth sub-
 scription Mme. Le Davadie declared that she no longer had in her
 possession any notes, letters, ciphers, or photographs belonging to
 the service.

 With the termination money in her purse and all the anger in her
 heart, Mme. Le Davadie went to the nearest bistro.  She was a
 temperate woman and despised excessive drinking, but this time she
 had to have an outlet.  Not from worry about her future but for
 her wrath toward Monin.  She couldn't take her anger out on the
 faceless Okhrana.  If she knew any of its officers, it would be differ-
 ent; but going to the Russian embassy without knowing anyone, as
 ex-agent Fontana once had done, would be futile and ridiculous.
 They would say they'd never heard of her or of Bittard-Monin or
 anyone like that.
 Two other agents Monin had dismissed that day were in the
 bistro--Mme. Drouchot, whom Mme. Le Davadie knew well but
 disliked, and Auguste Pouchot, with whom she had once served on a
 surveillance team in Montreux.  As an agent she would have never
 approached them publicly, but now, savoring her new freedom, she
 joined them at the table.  No explanations were necessary; she saw at
 once that they both had been canned too.  The three joined in cursing
 Bittard-Monin.
 "The bastard should not have thrown you out," said Mme. Drouchot,
 meaningfully.  Le Davadie felt like grabbing her hair for twisting
 this one in; then she realized that Mine. Drouchot had already taken
 more cognac than was needed to drown her bitterness.  Pouchot too
 was nearly drunk.  She determined at once not to follow their ex-
 ample.  She had only one absinthe and sipped it slowly, thinking.
 Not really listening to the other two, she heard them naming Burtzev
 again and again, just as Monin had, it seemed a hundred times.
 Burtzev's revolutionary. intelligence had busted Paris Okhrana.  He
 was powerful, the Sherlock Holmes of the revolution.  All the press
 of Paris was praising him, and the leading politicians were fighting
 his battles in parliament.
 On the Victor's Bandwagon
 Mine. Le Davadie made up her mind.  Without even finishing her
 drink, she left her companions and went straight to the rue de La
 Glaciere.  She knew Burtzev's office well from having done sur-
 veillance on it.  She would get even with Monin.  She would join
 the revolutionary service; and Burtzev, now so strong and successful,
 would pay her just as he was paying Leroi, who had defected as
 Okhrana agent at about the time she had formally signed on in 1911.
 She would even be paid for her revenge.

 The office at 53 rue de la Glacicre was a noisier place than Monin's
 bureau.  It was not large, but some half dozen people were engaged
 in heated discussions.  Burtzev was not there; his assistant Leroi
 received her.  This was well.  She knew how much influence he had
 with Burtzev, and she thought he would help her.  Back in 1908 he
 had been one of her more persistent admirers among the investigation
 agents.  True that his awkwardly long figure, frequently unstable
 because of too much alcohol, had not attracted her even to the point
 of the camaraderie usual among fellow agents; but when he was
 sober and alone with her, he used to flatter her with attentions.  Now
 he showed his surprise and joy at seeing her.  He moved as though
 to kiss her in front of everyone but settled for kissing her hand.  He
 took her to Burtzev's private office.
 When the pleasantries were over, she described how she had quit
 Monin and the Okhrana, and much of what she said was quite untrue.
 They wanted her to stay, she said, but she was fed up with them
 all and wanted to get even, particularly with Monin and his net.
 She finally recognized, she said, that Burtzev was doing the right
 thing, and she would be glad to join him even at a small salary, just
 enough to keep her alive.  She would help to the best of her ability
 to fight and expose the entire Russian service.  Leroi was pleased, and
 they worked out a preliminary plan of employment that he thought
 would be acceptable to Burtzev.  She also was pleased, and she
 forgot all her past antipathy for Leroi.
 she took him to her apartment.
 The following day, on 1 November 1913, Mme. Richard Le Davadie
 was hired as agent of the revolutionary intelligence service.  Leroi
 spoke enthusiastically to Burtzev about her exceptional qualities and
 vast knowledge of the personnel and activities of the Okhrana's non-
 Russian networks in France, Switzerland, and Italy, as well as her
 excellent  current  motivation.  Burtzev  was  not  opposed;   but,
 seasoned as he was in the game and not sharing Leroi's personal
 reasons for enthusiasm, he. wanted first to determine how much she
 knew and to make sure she was not a plant of some kind.  She had
 to be interrogated in detail, be kept under surveillance for several
 days, and in the meantime be given no chance to learn anything
 about his service.
 The first interrogation satisfied Burtzev about her knowledge, and
 the many questions about Okhrana targets, methods of surveillance,
 timing and location of operations, reporting procedures in clear and
 in code, and cooperation with local security organs convinced Le

 Davadie that she was dealing with just as professional a service as
 the one she had left.  She knew enough to fill a book, and since it
 would take forever to get this in debriefings, Burtzev told her to put
 in writing a full account of every surveillance job she had done since
 February 1911, when she formally became a salaried Okhrrana agent.
 She could write this in the quiet of her own apartment.
 Burtzev gave her 40 francs and the promise of a better monthly
 salary than that.  All she had to do for the time being was write this
 report and keep in daily touch with Leroi or with Burtzev if Leroi
 was away.  Leroi accompanied her home.  Pleased as Punch, he
 wanted to celebrate right away, and on her 40 francs.  But she was
 not in the mood.   She was disturbed by his assurances of how they
 would have a secure job together and he would look after her, and
 especially by his remark that he personally would take care of the
 surveillance Burtzev wanted her kept under. She talked him out of
 coming up to her apartment this time.
 Second Thoughts
 Alone, it took her but little thinking to decide that she could
 never serve Leroi; that was about what this job would mean.  And
 although Burtzev made a pleasant impression on her-'the kindly,
 soft-spoken, bearded, scholarly gentleman knew how to treat a lady-
 those 40 francs of salary advance perturbed her.  The appearance of
 the people in Burtzev's office, too, like Leroi's shabbiness:, gave her
 shivers.  They looked intellectual all right, but all haggard and
 undernourished.  She understood no Russian, and their speaking it
 made her feel strange.  No, she couldn't bring herself to associate
 with Leroi and those sallow-faced conspirators, even if the prospects
 of remuneration had been brighter than they were.
 Late the same evening, after she had made up her mind not to
 go through with it, she had a visitor.  Thinking it might: be Leroi,
 she was not going to answer the door, but the knocking persisted
 and the caller spoke her last name.  She opened to find Henri Bint
 there.  She had met Bint on two occasions, but he had never been
 in her apartment.  She liked the old reprobate.  "Henri!" she called

 lance team.  "I'm so pleased to see you.  What a surprise!"
 The call was not a social one.  Bint said he was sorry albout her
 dismissal from the Okhrana service but it was unavoidable for every-
 one, even for him after 35 years of service. She started talking about

 the ingrates and was going to indulge in some more scolding, but
 Bint stopped her:
 "You shouldn't feel bad.  You got yourself another job."
 "What job?" She looked puzzled.
 "With Burtzev's service.  I know it all."
 How could Bint, a mortal enemy of Leroi, know?  He knew just
 when she had made the two visits to Burtzev's office, what she had
 said to Leroi and Burtzev, what they said to her, and what was
 decided.  He even knew about the 40 francs and her assignment to
 write about the Okhrana.  He did not tell her that Jollivet, another
 "dismissed" Okhrana agent whom Mme. Le Davadie had never known,
 had recently been employed by Burtzev and had been in the office
 both times.
 Mine. Le Davadie was not at all embarrassed.  She told Bint she
 had just decided not to work for Burtzev after all.  But Bint had a
 different idea, and that was the reason for his visit. He had a simple
 plan: she should not only go ahead with Burtzev but perform so well
 as to make herself indispensable in the office on the rue de la Glaciere.
 She needed persuading.  They talked until after midnight.  She
 warned him that Leroi might come around, for she was to be under
 his surveillance for some time.  Bint knew all that; he had disposed of
 Leroi by seeing to it that he had a drinking partner at a cabaret.
 Le Davadie insisted that under no circumstances would she ever
 work again with Bittard-Monin.
 "Of course not," Bint said.  "Your position will be completely
 changed.  You will no longer be a detective conducting surveillance
 and investigating through local security offices.  That is a thing of
 the past for you.  You will no longer be an overt agent for anyone.
 Your position will be that of a secret agent reporting to the Okhrana
 the inside story of revolutionary espionage and propaganda."  She
 liked the secrecy and the adventurousness of the proposal.  "But it
 would be dangerous)  To whom would I be reporting?  You?"
 "Maybe to me at times, but the Russians prefer to handle the secret
 agents themselves.  All important dealings would be with them."
 "How much will they pay?"
 Bint did not know exactly, but he was sure that as secret agent
 she would be getting much higher pay than ever before, depending
 partly upon herself.  As for the dangers, he said that the Okhrana
 people knew how to play it safe; she would only have to follow their

 instructions.  He told her he would visit her once more and then
 arrange a meeting with a Russian for further instructions. He
 promised to help her write the long story of her agent career that
 Burtzev required.
 Leroi, showing the signs of his night of drinking, called in the
 middle of the afternoon.  He found her at the table, in cheerful
 spirits, writing her report. He went on to the office to tell Burtzev
 that he had had the new recruit under surveillance and that she was
 now at home doing the required writing.
 On 4 November Le Davadie went to Burtzev's office again.  She
 brought a sheaf of papers in her own handwriting, done hastily and
 without much concern for tidiness.  They listed in simple chronologi-
 cal order, from 15 February 1911 to 29 October 1913, her singleton
 and team assignments-dates, locations, targets, where and how
 picked up, whom with, where followed.  In several instances the
 assistance of local security organs was noted.  The story was im-
 pressive in the quantity of data recalled but not so elaborate as to
 suggest reference to contemporary records.  It had of course been
 prepared by Bint, from the records in Bittard-Monin's office.  Before
 giving it to Le Davadie to copy he had also consulted Sushkov,
 assistant to Krassilnikov.
 New Jane at Work
 It is not known what code name Burtzev gave Le Davadie, who now
 became an operative in the revolutionary service.  Krassilnikov and
 all the Okhrana office thenceforth referred to her as Jane.  A great
 pile of reports from December 1913 to late summer 1914, when Burtzev
 folded up his office and returned to Russia, attests that she knew and
 reported every move made by the revolutionaries.   The records indi-
 cate that all her reports were in writing, urgent ones in the con-
 venient enveloppes pneumatiques which were handled like telegrams,
 others in ordinary registered mail, often addressed to Bint's cover firm.
 At no time, it appears, did she arouse suspicion in Burtzev or his staff.
 She reported first on several French and Italian agents Monin had
 dismissed who came to Burtzev in search of employment.  In an
 effort to ingratiate themselves, these would all disparage Le Davadie's
 reputation as a person or an agent.  A Mme. Tiercelin, in particular,
 made vitriolic attacks on her as Monin's and other agents' mistress;
 but Burtzev and Leroi did not care.  Le Davadie did not hide any-

 thing-like that-from them, and she proved to he a good agent.
 They never suspected that all her reporting to them actually came
 from 79 rue de la Grenelle or was at least approved there.
 Thanks to Jane, the Okhrana was able to forstall a number of
 terrorist attempts during this period.  It was she who led Krassilnikov
 onto the trail of a certain Bessel as he left Brindisi for Macedonia to
 pick up a load of bombs for assassins in Russia.  Ile was arrested in
 Belgrade and his shipment confiscated on a train in Serbia.  By a
 curious coincidence, Jane was also assigned to help Burtzcv prepare
 evidence of Bessel's innocence for the revolutionary press to use in
 showing that the charges for the arrest in Belgrade had been trumped
 up by the Okhrana.
 Jane reported on the speeches Burtzev prepared for Jaurez to deliver
 in the French parliament attacking the Okhrana.  In some instances
 the Okhrana thus had Jaurez's speeches before he himself had seen
 them.  During the first half of 1914, when Burtzev exposed a con-
 siderable bag of Okhrana agents, both Russian and non-Russian, Jane
 could at least warn when and how they would be exposed.  She
 became so important to Burtzev that he wanted to take her with him
 early in 1914 on a campaign to expose the activities of the Russian
 secret service in the Italian parliament.  She consulted Krassilnikov,
 who actually approved the trip, but she preferred to develop an acute
 migrant: she was afraid that it might bring to light discrepancies in
 her first report to Burtzev with respect to cooperation with Italian
 security personnel.
 It is evident from Okhrana records that Jane ceased to be an agent
 after Burtzev's departure and the closing of his service.  She ap-
 parently located some war-related employment; in August and Sep-
 tember 1914 at least half the personnel of the Okhrana abroad were
 drafted into military services.
 Soon after the outbreak of the revolution a number of writers began
 competing in their efforts to expose all Okhrana secret agents.  Jane's
 role was somehow never exposed, even by writer Agafonov, who as
 a member of the commission investigating the Okhrana had full
 access to her papers.  It is possible that he was unable to detect her
 identity behind the cover name.  Several writers named Le Davadie
 among the non-Russian investigation agents belonging to the Bittard-
 Monin network, but all ignore not only her services for Burtzev but
 her double role for the Okhrana.

 La Petite
 Three intelligence services used "the little one"-the revolutionaries
 when she was a child, the Austrians against Russia, and the Russians
 against Austria.  The files of Paris Okhrana contained only 3 x 5 cards
 on the activities of her parents, but Pavel Zavarzin, Warsaw Okhrana
 chief at the time of the childhood episode, has told her story.
 Living Doll
 The Warsaw Okhrana office was located in the Hotel de 'Ville, a
 large building which also provided living quarters for Zavarzin and
 his subordinates with their families.  Beginning in 1904, milk was
 delivered in a large can to the Zavarzin apartment by an eleven-year-
 old girl.  It came from a dairy where her mother was also employed.
 The girl was diminutive and charming.  She had light, fluffy blond
 hair and brilliant blue eyes, like a doll.  Everybody called her La
 Petite.  Pleased by her promptness and friendliness, the occupants of
 the Hotel de Ville spoiled her with gifts of all sorts.  A particular
 attachment was formed between her and the children of Yan, Zavar-
 zin's coachman.
 This pleasant association flourished for two years.  Then one day
 a surveillance team was tailing a female terrorist named Rotte.  She
 was accompanied by a young girl carrying a milk can, apparently
 full.  They both went into a house in the Warsaw suburb Praga;
 within five minutes the girl came out alone and without the can.
 The detectives now recognized her as La Petite.  One of them fol-
 lowed to see where she would go next.  Surveilling a child proved to
 be a difficult game: she often stopped and played at corners or
 wandered down side streets looking in the windows.  After two hours
 she was back at home.
 A penetration of a terrorist group reported at about this time that
 groups preparing assassinations and robberies were using children
 to deliver arms, one piece at a time, to the perpetrators.  A child
 carrying a package or container with a small gun or bomb inside
 would be followed by a terrorist at some distance, then overtaken at
 the place of action.  The investigation of a number of terrorist acts
 confirmed that this was indeed the practice.  Penetrations :reported
 also that the conspirators maintained surveillance of the Okhrana
 premises in a way that would never be detected.  The conspirators
 knew the tag numbers of Okhrana carriages and the names of officers

 and surveillance agents.  Still another report said that the sub-
 versives had possession of some important documents stolen from the
 Okhrana office.
 Elaborate security precautions had always been taken to keep un-
 authorized personnel off the Okhrana premises.              La Petite was the
 only outsider ever admitted to the official quarters, and now she had
 been seen with the terrorist Rotte.  A few forgotten incidents of the
 past two years were now recalled.    One morning, Zavarzin himself
 remembered, he had found Yan's wife and daughter Handzhia clean-
 ing his office, and La Petite was with them.  When he asked what she
 was doing there, "After I delivered the milk I came to see Handzhia,"
 she had said.
 She spoke perfect Russian.  Her explanation was that her father,
 although a Pole from Austria, spoke only Russian at home, having
 learned it during years of employment in a Moscow brewery.  After
 his death three years earlier her mother had come to work in Warsaw.
 Zavarzin recalled also that one morning his administrative assistant
 was unable to find a batch of papers which he thought he had-
 careelessly-left on a table the night before.  A thorough search was
 made without success.  Moreover, La Petite was often seen in the
 carriage shed and the dressing room where agents changed into
 coachman's uniform for surveillance assignments.
 La Petite and her mother were both placed under surveillance.  It
 was soon learned that the woman lived with Mishas, an influential
 member of the Polish Socialist Party, and that this man had been
 accompanied by La Petite on walks through the city.  It was decided
 that the mother, being an Austrian subject, should be expelled from
 Warsaw and should be induced to take La Petite with her.
 Zavarzin had them both brought to his office.  The mother, named
 Kusitska, was cooperative but evasive when it came to giving in-
 formation.  When she realized he knew about her daughter's activity,
 she admitted through tears that she had been unable to counteract
 the corrupting pressure of the revolutionaries upon her child.  She
 would therefore be glad to leave Warsaw for any place where she
 could get the girl away from their vicious influence and enroll her
 in some school.
 "One would not give her ten years," she said, "and she's already
 thirteen.  She did spy on your office at first, but after being treated
 so kindly by you all she was ashamed and stopped.  Didn't you?"
 The girl was all red in the face, too embarrassed to answer, or more
 likely unwilling to confirm a patent lie.
 Nine years later, when Russia and Austria were at war and. Zavarzin
 was in charge of the Okhrana office in Odessa, he received a telephone
 call late in the evening.  A woman's voice: "Hello, Colonel Zavarzin,
 Chief of Section."  No one ever addressed him thus by title?  Whose
 was this strange, attractive voice?
 "I must see you urgently, but not in your office.  I'm calling from
 the railroad station.  Tell me a good hotel where we can meet."
 "But who are you?"
 "La Petite from Warsaw.  Do you remember me?"
 She stayed in the Hotel London, but the meeting took place in
 a safe house.  Zavarzin instructed Budakov, his chief of surveillance,
 to arrange for complete coverage after the meeting.  He did not
 share Budakov's fears for the meeting itself-that La Petite might
 come with a pistol in her muff.
 She came in, still small for a grown woman, scintillating with
 pleasure: "You remember me!  That's so wonderful!    But I'm no
 longer the subversive La Petite of Warsaw.  I have become your
 ally,  Before coming in I asked this man [Budakov] to inspect my
 bag..  One could of course expect anything from La Petite of the
 past." Zavarzin soon realized that she had become a professional
 intelligence agent.  But whose?
 "You have no doubt taken measures to keep me under surveillance,"
 she plunged in.  "That's important, because at one after midnight
 tonight I am to meet at the Variete a man I don't know.  I'm to be
 introduced to him by a woman who is appearing in the show as a
 famous sharpshooter.  The man is in touch with the Austrian general
 staff, and it will be important for you to keep him under close watch.
 He is one of the top Austrian agents here.  Then tomorrow I am
 going to Petersburg to see Okhrana chief Bieletzky, who will probably
 take me to the imperial general staff.  It may be that on the road
 to Petersburg I shall be met by persons in whom you may be inter-
 ested, so you will probably want to have me covered all the way
 through."
 Having disposed of this urgent matter on her mind, the attractive
 visitor proposed dinner.  She was tired and hungry; the wartime trip
 from Vienna to Odessa was by no means without hardships.  After the
 meal she was ready to talk about her past.  But first she Wanted to
 thank Zavarzin as the great benefactor who had played an important
 role in her life.  Instead of putting her mother and her in prison

 he had given them good advice and sent them to safety. Her mother,
 La Petite said, had been a weak woman; for a little love she had be-
 come a slave to Mishas.  His every word came to be an order for both
 mother and child.  La Petite delivered dynamite and bombs for the
 Rotte woman and other terrorists.  It was Mishas' plan to blow up
 the. Warsaw Okhrana office and kill Zavarzin.  As a child she had been
 fascinated by the plan, and Mishas became a hero in her eyes.  Three
 years after leaving Warsaw, when she read in the newspapers about
 the apprehension of the Warsaw terrorists, including Mishas, and their
 trial and execution, she realized how criminal her activities had been.
 Zavarzin probably did not swallow whole the story of her remorse,
 for he changed the cgnversation with a question about the color
 of her hair.  As a child it was light blond, now nearly jet black.
 How come?     She said she dyed it in order to look -older.  Then she
 went back to what had happened since she last saw him at thirteen.
 Tale of Two Services
 Upon arrival in Lvov her mother sent her to a convent for schooling
 and to learn dressmaking.  It was a harsh life, with constant work or
 kneeling in prayer and frequent cruel punishment as she grew
 rebellious.  More often than not she was hungry, and after her
 mother's death she had no affection from anyone.  One day the
 mother superior found her crying in the cold chapel, took pity on her,
 and promised thereafter to be a mother to her.  Life remained hard,
 but under the old abbess' protection Seraphine, as she was named
 in the convent, became an obedient pupil.
 After six years of convent life she was employed in the household
 of a wealthy Galician merchant.  A romance soon developed with
 the merchant's nephew and they were married.    He was a panslavist
 employed by the Russian services, and thus both newly-weds were
 soon working for the Russians in Austrian Galicia.
 When the war broke out the Austrians drafted her husband, and
 soon thereafter he was taken prisoner by the Russians.  La Petite,
 after giving birth to a child, made up her mind to get to Russia at
 all. costs.  She thought of the possibility of being taken into the
 Austrian espionage service and sent there.  Leaving the baby with
 her mother-in-law, she set up as a dressmaker catering to various
 families of army officers.  In time she found an officer of the general
 staff who was interested in more than her dressmaking.

 Her frequent night meetings with this man gave her a chance to
 let him see her, incidentally, as an Austrian patriot who knew Warsaw
 extremely well, spoke Russian perfectly, and was intelligent and re-
 sourceful.  She did not need to prompt him to the proposal that she
 would do well in Austrian intelligence.  With all the modesty
 Seraphine had learned in the convent, she replied that she had no
 experience to fit her for such work, but he insisted that she should
 at least give it a try.  After a few days of thinking it over, she decided
 that there would be nothing wrong in tentative acceptance.
 They tried all sorts of tests on her. Questions were shot at her
 in the least expected forms.  She would be left alone in an office
 with documents marked secret scattered on the desks and watched
 through a peephole to see whether she showed undue interest in the
 papers.  She was followed on city streets to determine whether she
 had assimilated the psychological training they had given her in
 operational conduct and patriotism.  After two months' training the
 Austrians set up an interview with a German officer.  He inter-
 rogated her in German and Russian and found her Russian more
 fluent than her German.  When he learned that the convent had
 given her considerable training in caring for the sick, he named her
 on the spot chief nurse in a hospital for seriously wounded Russian
 prisoners.  It was he who insisted that she dye her hair black so
 as to look old enough to be a chief nurse.  Her job was to attend
 the wounded and report anything they might say, perhaps in. delirium,
 of interest to the German forces.
 After three months of this service, she was summoned before a
 captain and told she had been assigned an important mission on
 which much would be expected of her.
 "From now on your name shall be Anna Yakovlevna Lyubova, with
 Tyumen in Siberia as your place of origin.  Here is your passport.
 It is a genuine document: the real Lyubova is here in Austria.  She
 is married and has no desire to return to Russia.  You will take her
 place among a large group of Russians who are being repatriated in
 exchange for Austrians from Russia.  In this assignment you will
 have to exercise much prudence, and if there arc difficulties you will
 have to be guided by your patriotism.  We all put our country
 first . . ."
 The entire operational program, with many alternative courses of
 action, was outlined for "Lyubova."  She was to contact Austrian
 agents and deliver them instructions all along the way, as far as

 Vladivostok.  From there she was to go on to Harbin and then
 proceed to Shanghai, where she should report to the German con-
 sulate.
 L'Autrichienne
 From Odessa Zavarzin promptly wired to Petersburg headquarters
 the whole long story.  Surveilling La Petite and her German contacts
 the same night, Budakov found that the introduction and meeting
 took place as she had told.  The sharpshooter woman and the German
 man, named Gross, were both exiled to Siberia for the duration; there
 was not enough proof to hang them.
 La Petite revealed also that the German dreadnoughts "Goeben"
 and "Breslau" were heading for the Black Sea to bombard Russian
 ports.  This information was confirmed within a few days.  Although
 Zavarzin had reported the intelligence promptly, the defense com-
 mand was in no position to take counter action, and the attack caused
 havoc in several harbors.
 "Lyubova" was carefully watched on her way to Petersburg, where
 she went directly to the Okhrana chief as scheduled.  He had her
 case transferred to military intelligence, and there was no trace in
 Okhrana files of her subsequent whereabouts and activities.  Years
 after his exile, Zavarzin speculated that a dashing young lady of her
 description who lived in Monte Carlo and was known as "1'Autri-
 chiienne," speaking perfect Russian and Polish, of angelic beauty,
 and wildly spending her Brazilian husband's wealth, could be La
 Petite.

 The Agency's Office of Security keeps a watch list of nearly four
 thousand persons or organizations who have tried to visit, write, or
 phone its officials and who have been, at a minimum, a source of
 annoyance.  Every suspected crank contact is checked against this
 list.  The signatures include "The Green Russian" in Charlotte,
 N.C., and "Your Aunt Minnie" in San Francisco.  Nearly all crank
 letters are domestic, but alongside addresses in Pewee Valley, Ky.,
 and Big Bear City, Cal., are foreign listings from Quito to Warsaw
 and from Edinburgh to Australia.
 Steadies and One-Timers
 The flow of oddball letters and phone calls increases perceptibly
 when CIA is in the news.  Less than 48 hours after President Johnson
 announced he would nominate Admiral Raborn to be the DCI, a
 Detroit man had sent the Director-designate 8,000 words of com-
 plaint about the high cost of prescription medicines and a New Yorker
 had asked his help in controlling a whistling brain.  The file of
 letters to him was mounting even before his appointment had been
 confirmed.  On 17 April a Massachusetts man sent him some well-
 intentioned advice.  "Dear Admiral," he wrote, "as you may be
 aware, L.B.J. ain't got much Brains or he wouldn't be President.  I
 dealt with his type for 37 years.  The best way to get along with
 him is humor him."
 But a faithful nucleus of loyal intelligence fans always contributes
 about 25 percent of the total.  Probably most of the cranks are as
 harmless as the childish codes they sometimes use.  The trouble is,
 they're unpredictable.  A few might have complaints worth hearing;
 others might pose a real threat to an unsuspecting officer who re-
 ceived them.
 Nut-and-dolt visits to headquarters offices have practically dis-
 appeared since CIA moved out to Langley; an occasional walk-in still
 calls at its personnel office downtown.  Its overt or semi-overt
 domestic offices, which are more approachable, have now compiled
 an impressive record of coping with off-beat visitors.
 Clairvoyance and Contrivances

 in their teeth.  One disturbed gentleman from Buffalo claimed the

 such a complaint, the prize probably goes to the CIA man who as-
 sured a woman she might indeed be getting radio messages by static
 electricity.  Reminding her of the chains that drag under gasoline
 trucks, he linked a series of paper clips, hooked one end in her skirt,
 let the other end trail on the floor, and sent her happily on her way
 with the static safely grounded.
 Then there was the man who came in to volunteer as a spy in
 the Czechoslovakian uranium mines.  He confided that he had been
 stalling because he feared the radiation might make him sterile.
 Now, however, he had solved this problem: he planned to carry along
 a carton of Chesterfields and wrap the tinfoil around his private
 parts.  The Agency secretary who transcribed a memorandum on
 his visit never could understand why he insisted on Chesterfields.
 Some fairly far-out ideas have been seriously proposed by sensible
 citizens.  One responsible businessman developed a mechanical chess-
 playing machine which countered any move according to prepunched
 IBM cards.  He proposed to take his machine to Moscow, consolidate
 his position there, and then suggest that the machine could be used
 as a training aid for any move-and-countermove situation, such as
 military tactics.  Instead of chessmen he would use symbols for
 tanks, infantry, hills, forests, planes, and fields of fire.  Since he
 knew nothing about military tactics, the Soviet general staff would
 have to tell him the prescribed response to every move.  As soon as
 he had all the responses punched on IBM cards he would deliver
 duplicates to the American Embassy.  Then if we ever faced the
 USSR in battle we could always run the IBM cards and tell what
 the Soviets would do next.
 The most intriguing case investigated by a domestic office involved
 a school superintendent of unassailable reliability who dabbled in
 hypnotism as a hobby and reported that he could induce clairvoyance
 in his subject, an engineering student.  In 1957, while in a hypnotic
 trance, the subject described in minute technical detail a Soviet
 ballistic missile of a type unknown in the United States but con-
 sistent with expert private assessments of Soviet capabilities.  The
 research chief of a respected American aircraft plant was present at
 the demonstration, framed many questions, and made a tape recording
 of the answers.  The subject used technical and scientific terminology

 which neither he nor the hypnotist could be expected to know.  Wash-
 ington experts who studied the tape found "just enough substantive
 data to stimulate the imagination" but decided that clairvoyance
 would be "a very risky approach to the collection of Soviet guided
 missile data."  The mystery remains unsolved.
 Other Field Office Walk-ins
 Some unlikely sources have produced usable information.  In 1959
 a soldier of fortune fresh from Cuba wearing yellow canvas shoes,
 red denim slacks, and a gaudy sport shirt contacted a domestic office.
 His debriefing was worth while but abbreviated by his arrest for
 having a bag of dynamite in his hotel room.  In October 1964 a
 Miami man brought to CIA a box which he had bought sight-unseen
 at an auction of shipments abandoned in U.S. customs.  The box
 contained more than 2,000 negatives of Cuban propaganda. And on
 8 July 1960 an admitted swindler and diamond smuggler volunteered
 the information that five Soviet missile experts had just travelled to
 Cuba by way of Mexico.  This report was taken with a grain of
 salt at the time.
 One probable James Bond fan seems obsessed with finding un-
 usual ways of eliminating the opposition.  Besides the usual poisons
 and trick guns, he has suggested a lethally exploding cigar disguised
 with a band reading "It's a boy!"  He has also offered to dispose
 of bodies for us in his home meat grinder.  An attractive divorcee
 leads a sober life in this country as an airline secretary but regularly
 flies to another country and cuts loose there among the political
 leaders.  For all her Mata Hari complex she has brought useful
 information.
 Ever since 1948 a Slovak economist has been trying to peddle
 information he claims to obtain through a private underground net.
 He is presentable and persuasive and has impressed countless high
 officials, including a senator who brought him to lunch with the
 upper echelons of CIA.  Fortunately these official contacts quickly
 lead back to a burn notice identifying him as a fabricator.  As late
 as 1963, however, he was still trying with some success to interest
 leading American industries in technical data from anti-Communist
 researchers behind the iron curtain.  Having abandoned the atomic
 cannon he offered the government, he was tempting industry with
 everything from synthetic fibers to jet engine designs, high-temperature
 ceramics, and flexible concrete.   Meanwhile he had hired a lawyer

 and sued a Washington shoe store for $25,000 because his shoes
 were too tight; in the brief he filed with the court he claimed that as
 a spy he needed to run fast.
 Letters to Langley
 By far the greatest number of crank contacts are by mail.  In the
 first eight months of Fiscal Year 1965, 1,143 letters addressed simply
 to CIA were identified as from cranks.  This does not count those
 addressed otherwise-to the DCI by name or to specific field offices.
 Neither does it include some unsolicited letters which may be help-
 ful, pathetic, or merely misguided but are not from cranks.  The
 following examples are all from March 1965: An ex-Marine sent a
 possibly practical suggestion for guerrilla warfare.  A 17-year-old
 Thai girl asked how to get training in police investigation.  A German
 student asked for help in locating his father, who had been captured
 by the Soviets in World War H.  A 14-year-old boy asked if there
 were really such organizations as SMERSII and U.N.C.L.E.  All such
 writers receive courteous replies.
 But in the same month there arrived elaborate greetings to the
 DCI from a Maryland woman who thinks she is Catherine III, Empress
 of all the Russias, and who had previously sent a 5,000-word report
 on how she insured the successful invasion of Europe by entertaining
 Hitler privately for 12 hours on D-Day.  Also in March 1965 came
 the advice that "now is the time-at last-to train 100 of the top
 CIA men to penetrate every possible beauty parlor and Chinese
 restaurant . . . the results will amaze and constantly astound your
 organization."  On 13 March a New York correspondent informed its
 that Rudolph Hess, from his cell in Spandau, was controlling ten
 leading Southern segregationists by long-distance hypnotism.  And on
 25 March a woman wrote to the Director from Massachusetts: "As
 near as I can make out there normally is a grey cloud at the base
 of the psyche.  When the cloud backs up you go out of focus.  But
 after taking Alka Seltzer and sodium bicarbonate I can sing Hokus
 Pokus you're in focus."
 A 1964 letter was addressed to "Snuffy McDuffy, Top Floor, Closed
 Door, CIA, Washington, D.C."  Perceptive mail clerks sent it to the
 Director's office, where it was found to contain a fairly reasonable
 suggestion for propaganda.  The letter ended: "P.S.  If you don't take
 appropriate action I'll write to the President and tell him you're
 chicken."

 Probably the most imaginative and persistent correspondent is a
 gaunt long-faced man with sunken eyes and prominent ears who first
 wrote to CIA on 27 January 1952 asking for a high-powered rifle
 with telescopic sights and terrain maps of Siberia, Manchuria, and
 Korea.  Since then he has sent thousands of letters, postcards, and
 telegrams and used more than 50 aliases ranging from "Alexis Alex-
 androvich" to "Old Woody, The Fox."  Usually he signs his true
 name followed by "U.S. Code 143," CIA's government tie-line code.
 Here we shall call him Old Woody.
 Even though his handwriting and literary style are well known
 around the DCI's office, age cannot wither nor custom stale Old
 Woody's infinite variety.  One letter told the Director: "I have
 allotted you a maximum life span of 94 years, not to exceed the year
 1987."  Another complained that "someone has wired my head for
 sight and sound."  A third urged the Director to "tell Hoffa to require
 seat belts in all trucks."  A fourth began: "Allen, I regret to inform
 you Kennedy won the election fair and square."  Then came a tele-
 gram (collect) from Florida: "REQUEST FEDERAL TROOPS,
 MARTIAL LAW.       MIAMI SITUATION OUT OF CONTROL."
 Old. Woody travels widely, usually first class.  He has written from
 Cuba, Puerto Rico, Nassau, Honolulu, and Hong Kong, as well as
 from most major cities in the United States.     On domestic airlines
 and in American hotels he has often registered as "A.W. Dulles, Jr."
 and mailed cancelled tickets and receipted bills to CIA.  He likes
 luxury hotels; his suite at a Washington hotel in 1960 was billed at
 $52 a day.  On many of his trips he listed CIA's street address as
 his residence and the DCI as his next-of-kin, often reinforcing the
 latter claim by taking out $62,500 in flight insurance with the Director
 as beneficiary.
 In October 1964 Old Woody was arrested for vagrancy in Richmond.
 Allowed only one phone call, be used it to notify CIA of his plight.
 A couple of weeks later he phoned to report his new motorcycle
 license, and still later he wrote that he was working on a boat in
 Miami.  Back in the money early in 1965, he wrote from Bermuda
 that he had been appointed King of the British Empire.
 The risk of arrest does not dampen Old Woody's enthusiasm for
 the service.  In August 1960 he made a telephone appointment with
 the commanding officer of an Air Force base in Nevada, conducted
 a "CIA security inspection," used the base commander's telephone
 to call CIA headquarters in Washington, and on departure warned
 the commander that some officers were out of uniform at Harcld's
 Club.  After sending MP's on a wild goose chase to the gambling
 club, the base commander somewhat grumpily reported the incident
 in an official letter to CIA.  A few months later Old Woody was not
 so lucky. In Ponce, Puerto Rico, he represented himself as an FBI
 agent, borrowed a jeep from the National Guard, and drove it across
 the island to San Juan, where he was arrested.  "Dear Allen," he
 wrote from jail, "I am in trouble again."  A few days later he grew
 petulant.  "You are wasting your time and the Armed Forces' time,"
 he wrote, "I do not intend a reconciliation."
 Generous to a fault, Old Woody rented a Cadillac limousine and
 chauffeur at $100 a day just before Christmas 1960 and drove to the
 Soviet embassy, where he left $100 for Francis Gary Powers.  't'hen
 he drove to the Cuban embassy with $100 for prisoners on the Isle
 of Pines, and then to the American Red Cross, where he contributed
 $70 to help unmarried mothers.  Finally he came to CIA headquarters
 and handed the receptionist an envelope addressed to Mr. Dulles
 containing $50 as a Christmas present,  These activities landed him
 in St. Elizabeth's Hospital, from which he escaped a few days later
 after getting back the $50 from CIA.  But he was pleased with the
 episode; nearly two years later he wrote Mr. Dulles that "some day
 I'll give you another $50 bill as a token of my affection."
 In November 1961 he wrote from El Paso: "When the new Direc-
 tor takes over, I guess I'll wash my hands of CIA."  But Old Woody
 didn't, and the flow of letters continues.  In December 1961 he put
 down CIA as his home address when he opened a bank account in
 Wilmington, Delaware.  In October 1962 he telegraphed from Chi-
 cago: "FIDEL CASTRO MINUS HIS BEARD ARRIVED CHICAGO
 THIS P.M.  HAVE DETAIL COVERING HIM." In September
 1963 a Washington-Miami airliner turned back and off-loaded him;
 be had alarmed fellow-passengers by claiming to be a personal friend
 of Fidel Castro and trying to communicate with CIA by radio.
 Is Old Woody just a harmless screwball?  In 1960 he wrote:, "Allen,
 I am going to start carrying a regulation FBI revolver and if someone
 forces me into a situation I intend on using it."  In 1961 he warned
 Mr. Dulles: "The bomb attached to my radio in Room 313 has not
 availed you anything so far."  Who knows what Old Woody will
 interpret as "a situation"?  At a minimum, he has cost the Govern-

 ment a great many dollars in wasted time, filing space, analyses, and
 precautions.  As he himself put it in a 1960 letter from West Palm
 Beach: "Allen, you should deduct me from your income tax."
 Fish and a Record
 Some crank correspondents are remarkably well educated and
 successful in business or the arts.  Take the 50-year-old daughter
 of a high-ranking Army officer who now owns a prosperous small-
 town shop.  Educated in Europe and widely travelled, she served
 abroad with the Red Cross in World War II and has written many
 successful books-including one which was made into a major motion
 picture.  She writes beautifully and, at first glance, convincingly.
 It was the fish that gave her away.  Her early letters just asked
 for information about an inner circle of Government officials who
 used a drawing of a fish as the symbol of "a confidentially shared
 community of patriotic attitude."  Then she started sending CIA offi-
 cials postcards with crude drawings of fish.  Later she adopted the
 fish as a signature to her own letters.
 In 1962 the fish-woman asked the vice president of a Washington
 bank to help finance a small private counterespionage organization
 working to expose "the mammoth traitorous operation at present
 flourishing within our Government."  Meanwhile she wrote threaten-
 ing anonymous letters, mailed them to herself, and then forwarded
 them to CIA to prove the existence of a conspiracy.  Ignored for
 years, she continues writing long and quite articulate letters.  The
 most recent one, mailed in March 1965, contains roughly 11,000
 words.
 One might think that if no one answered their letters the crank
 correspondents would eventually get discouraged and quit writing.
 This is not always true.  CIA's most faithful correspondent has been
 plugging a single theme steadily since 1951, when he decided a
 "CIA agent" had welshed on a job offer.  Almost every day he mails
 a postcard with the same message: "Take Action on CIA Agent Joe
 Blank!"  He has been arrested and released on his promise to stop
 writing; within a few days the postcards arrive again.  He has written
 from Miami, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Phoenix, Denver, Rochester,
 Colorado Springs, and Hampton, Va.-hitting his peak in 1962 with
 n total of 332 postcards to CIA.  Ile has also carried his complaint
 to the Secretary of Defense, but a special assistant at the Pentagon
 politely suggested in reply that he deal directly with CIA.
 Violence
 Are such cranks actually dangerous?  Read on.
 On 13 March 1963 a "consulting nuclear engineer" called at CIA's
 downtown personnel office and tried to see the DCI.  File checks
 showed that four years earlier he had sent the Director a letter
 marked "DEATH" and signed "Lord God, God of Israel."  Or. 28
 October 1958 he had hired a taxi in Richmond, picked up two hitch-
 hikers and a 9-year-old boy, and tried to invade the Quantico Marine
 Corps School brandishing the boy's toy pistols.
 The night of 21 February 1962 a man who thought the was a CIA
 agent telephoned four times trying to report to the Director. On 11
 November 1962 the same man was arrested in Rapid City, S.D., after
 terrorizing residential areas of that city, firing dozens of shots through
 windows, and wounding one resident.  When arrested he was carry-
 ing a high-powered rifle, a .22-caliber rifle, and a large quantity of
 ammunition.
 One crank has been bombarding more than 50 top Government
 officials with details of alleged Communist electronic thought-control
 by "a coherent light process of inducing a state of controlled hypnosis
 by radiation of radio frequency energy on a wavelength of approxi-
 mately 4 x 10-5 centimeters."  The writer is officially diagnosed as
 a paranoiac schizophrenic, potentially dangerous.
 On 12 December 1964 a 53-year-old Florida real estate salesman
 mailed the DCI a crude threat note ending "Your card is the ACE
 OF SPADES."  This man had tried to see the Director in the past-
 once to discuss a proposed trip to Russia, again to report his inven-
 tion of the hardest metal in the world.  He is diagnosed as a chronic
 schizophrenic paranoiac with "delusions of grandeur, seclusiveness,
 and hostility" who should be kept in a "structured and supervised
 setting."  He was arrested three times in 1964, once for carrying a
 concealed weapon.  Earlier he had been arrested for armed robbery
 and in 1960 in Arlington, Va., for attempted murder.
 In 1962, with the arrival of a new DCI, CIA informally reviewed
 protective measures with Secret Service and Metropolitan Police De-
 partment officers.  It was reaffirmed that, while the threat: of an
 attack on top Agency officials was unpredictable and might never

 materialize, it was nevertheless real enough to require professional
 protection.  Events since then have underlined this view, although
 there has been no (knock on wood) actual injury.  Probably the
 closest call was when a woman wrestler traced one top official to
 the home of relatives and lunged at him with a bouquet of roses
 which was afterwards found to hide a jagged broken beer bottle.
 In any intelligence agency it is important to keep track of crank
 contacts, not only to improve protection but also to assure continuity
 of control and analysis.  Centralization of records in CIA's Office
 of Security permits quick identification of phonies and time-wasters.
 Professional security officers know how to handle the off-beat ap-
 proach, and others would do well to rely on the professionals when
 they receive an irrational letter or find themselves face to face with
 an apparently unbalanced stranger.

 $4.95.)
 MUSKETOON: COMMANDO RAID, GLOMFJORD, 1942.  By
 Stephen Schofield.  (London: Jonathan Cape. 1964. 156 pp.
 18/-.)
 Two books on intelligence operations in Norway during World
 War II take their place on the growing bookshelf of Allied intelli-
 gence activities in Europe.
 Musketoon describes a September 1942 Commando raid on the
 power plant for an aluminum works at Glomfjord.  Ten British and
 two Norwegian Commandos, put ashore by the French submarine
 Junon, blew up the power generators and the pipeline that carried
 water from the mountain lakes, effectively shutting down the alumi-
 num plant for the rest of the war.  Eight of the raiders were captured,
 taken first to Colditz prison, and then to the RSHA building on
 Albrechtstrasse in Berlin for interrogation.  On October 23, under
 Hitler's order of the. 18th to kill all Commandos, they were executed
 at Sachsenhausen.
 The remarkable thing about the Musketoon raid, and what lay
 behind its success, was the excellent intelligence on which it was
 based.  The attacking party had every detail required for a precise
 sabotage operation in an area teeming with German troops.  Even
 three small slips didn't affect the outcome: a fishing boat spotted the
 submarine's periscope; an old lady at the window of her house by the
 fjord saw the Commandos land in their dinghy; and a German patrol
 discovered an empty Players cigarette package at a camp site they
 used.  Schofield has done a fine job of research in reconstructing the
 raid and the fate of the eight captives.
 Blood on the Midnight Sun consists of three stories of the Nor-
 wegian resistance.  The first describes how the Norwegians were able
 to get the country's gold reserves of $55,000,000 out of Oslo, north
 across the country to Andalsnes, and then by ship to England and

 across the Atlantic.  The story of smuggling out 1,542 heavy boxes
 by road, rail, and sea, just one jump ahead of German troops and
 under air attack, outdoes Hollywood at its best.
 The second episode concerns the heavy water plant at Vemork.
 Intelligence on the activities of this installation was reaching London
 almost as quickly as it reached Berlin, so when the Germans began
 to dismantle it on 31 January 1944 and were preparing to ship the
 stock of heavy water to Germany, word was passed that the shipment
 be stopped at all costs.  The Norwegians had intelligence indicating
 that it was to go by train from Vemork to Mael on Lake Tinn, by
 train-ferry across the Lake, and thence to Skien for shipping out.
 They determined to sink the train-ferry, the Hydro, at the deepest
 part of Lake Tinn, in about 1,200 feet of water, despite any cost in
 lives among the Norwegian crew and passengers.  The ship was
 sunk as planned, carrying 53 of the 57 heavy water tanks out of
 German reach.
 The third part, entitled "Friends and Foes in the Underground,"
 deals with an "Export Group" which established rat lines for escape.
 Among its accomplishments was assisting about half of Norway's 1,500
 Jews to sanctuary in Sweden.  This is a detailed report on its work
 in the Trondheim area, its penetration by Quisling agents and the
 Gestapo, and the constant undercover war for survival.
 Adamson and Klem have produced a book that is both readable
 and historically quite accurate.  They were a bit carried away by
 their determination to clear Norway's name of the "Quisling" stigma-
 no one has ever doubted the valor of the Norwegian home forces-
 but their contribution to intelligence literature is a valuable one.

 SPIONE IN HAMBURG UND AUF HELGOLAND.  By Frank

 In the fall of 1807 the British Navy, in connection with the attack
 it launched on thitherto neutral Denmark when Napoleon's designs
 on the Danish fleet became known, occupied the then Danish island
 of Helgoland which commands the approaches to the Elbe and Weser
 estuaries.  This small rock mountain-top in the North Sea rapidly
 became the chief illegal port of entry into Napoleon's Festung Europa.
 Big-time smugglers crowded onto the island and loaded it with
 thousands of tons of contraband: The few hundred Helgolanders,

 fishermen and pilots, grew rich sneaking their boats in to the main-
 land and handling cargo.  And less conspicuously, British intelligence
 established regular courier channels which brought out information
 and personnel from all over the continent and took back agents,
 propaganda pamphlets, and funds for dissident movements.
 A good deal of the smuggling and some of the intelligence story
 has been told before, in connection with individual episodes-how
 the Scotch priest Father James G. Robertson, under commission of
 the Duke-to-be of Wellington, was infiltrated to arrange the defec-
 tion from Napoleon of the elite Spanish troops under the Marquis de
 Romana and their evacuation from the mainland, how the British
 encouraged and financed too-little-and-too-early uprisings that ended
 tragically, like those of Schill and Dornberg (in which latter, two of
 the participants, Witzleben and Trott zu Selz, had descendants that
 repeated history 135 years later), how the Duke of Braunschweig-
 Oels fought all the way across Germany from Bohemia to evacuate
 his men through Helgoland, how the deposed, and mentally unsound
 Gustav Adolf IV of Sweden had a sojourn on the island.
 But now Herr Lynder makes public here for the first time the
 pertinent documents from the full correspondence between the so-
 to-speak Chief of Station Helgoland, Edward Nicholas, and the For-
 eign Minister in London, first George Canning and then Lord Henry
 Bathurst.  These Foreign Office papers, supplemented by some from
 the War Ministry and Admiralty and material from German archives
 and contemporary newspapers, add much realistic detail about pre-
 viously known events and describe new facets of the intelligence and
 counterintelligence operations.  The image of the self-sacrificing
 Scotch priest Robertson, for example, is somewhat smudged by two
 post facto letters from him in the Foreign Office files.  He had been
 paid about a thousand pounds for his mission, but after getting back
 to London he wrote stressing the dangers he had been through and
 asking for a job.  He listed his preferences and then requested finan-
 cial support in the meantime, adding the Latin proverb, "He gives
 doubly who gives fast."  Then a month later he tried again: "I've
 been much urged to publish something about my mission, but I refuse;

 When Bathurst took over the Foreign Office from Canning he asked
 Nicholas just how his communications into the continent worked.
 Nicholas answered (28 March 1810) :
 My packet of letters goes from here in a boat to the island Nework in
 the mouth of the Elbe.  At low tide you can wade ashore there and
 immediately hide the packet underground.  It stays there until someone
 comes and replaces it with a bundle of dispatches from the continent.
 This person takes the Helgoland packet and passes it to a second agent, who
 carries it to Hamburg via little-used roads.     As soon as it reaches there I
 count the greatest danger past.  In Hamburg a contact man distributes
 the letters among our various "personal friends," who in turn carry them
 securely on to their recipients in different countries of the continent.  Al-
 though from Nework to the distribution in Hamburg all of ten persons are
 working for me and so are witting, I can still say that in these two years
 past no single pouch of dispatches has been lost . . .
 Lynder tells the whole story chronologically, from the mid-Memel
 meeting of Napoleon and Alexander I on 25 June 1807, where British
 secret agent Colin Mackenzie-who later acted as case officer for
 Father Robertson-somehow learned that Napoleon intended to
 seize the Danish fleet, to the devastating letdown for the Helgolanders
 when Napoleon's defeat in 1813 put an end to their high living.  Al-
 though something like half his slim text is quotation from documents,
 these are selected and interwoven so skillfully, and loose ends so
 carefully researched and tied up, that they bring Station Helgoland
 and its operations vividly to life.

 Fair Exchange in the Cold War
 STRANGERS ON A BRIDGE.
 By James B. Donovan.

 brary.  1965.

 In reading Strangers on a Bridge my thoughts go back to the drama
 which was played out in U.S. government offices preceding and dur-
 ing the exchange of Rudolf Abel for Francis Powers.  All of this that
 went on behind the scenes of Jim Donovan's own drama unknown
 to him held a particular excitement for the participants.
 Donovan did know more than he put into the book.  But he was
 prudent enough to draw the line between what is of interest to the
 public and what is in the public interest, and he had help in drawing
 it. About six months after he had accomplished the exchange he
 mentioned to me, too casually I thought, that he was having trouble
 finding time to write his book.  Guardedly, I asked the question
 he wanted me to ask, "What book?" He said he had been wanting
 to write about some of his experiences; he thought the Abel case-
 he had been Abel's defense counsel, you recall-would be of particu-
 lar interest.  He then concluded, much too casually now, that he
 probably would end the book by "just mentioning the exchange."
 He didn't want an answer right then, but he was fishing for some
 kind of carte blanche approval.  Later it was agreed that he should
 submit galley proofs for review.  There wasn't much that needed
 security revision after all, and the story of the exchange made the
 book a best seller.
 Strangers on a Bridge is a well-knit book.  The eventual exchange
 comes as no surprise; Donovan carefully weaves in the possibility of
 one from the beginning and thus supplies the chief element of real
 suspense.  But this is not just a device to make a good story.  With
 Donovan's experience in OSS and a natural bent toward deviousness,
 I am sure he expected that his client would neither be executed nor
 rot in an American jail.  He was in fact troubled by the problem of
 how, if he won the case, the freed Abel could be used to the benefit
 of the United States.
 Donovan is a careful legal craftsman, and he also knows the in-
 gredients of a good story.  (He points out his early desire to be a
 newspaperman, and he often proudly reminisces about his news-
 paper experience before he entered Harvard Law School.)  He made
 espionage the dominant theme of the book, and as a result the legal
 intricacies of the search-and-seizure constitutional issue are bound

 claim that the USSR could not exercise criminal jurisdiction beyond
 certain upward limits, would not be entertained by the Soviet gov-
 ernment, it still could provide a basis for later negotiation.
 When the gigantic Soviet propaganda drive had been climaxed by
 Powers' trial, the decision to sentence him to prison for a term of
 years suggested that he might be ransomed for the right price. We
 knew that historically the USSR had shown keen interest in getting
 the prompt release of Soviet citizens held in foreign countries on
 espionage charges; but Abel they had not admitted to be a Soviet
 citizen.  We turned to Donovan as a channel through which Moscow
 might be willing to work.
 As Donovan writes, we waited until the trade winds shifted.  His
 letters to Helen Abel were composed in CIA, and we often thought
 of the parallel procedures that must have been going on in Moscow.
 When we finally got Helen Abel's letter describing her "visits" to
 the Soviet embassy in Berlin, we knew the Russians were ready to
 negotiate a trade of Powers for Abel.
 It then became necessary to negotiate within the U.S. government
 a position to present to the President concerning the release of Abel
 by pardon.  The President would act here on the recommendation of
 the Attorney General, who in such a case as this would make his
 recommendation only after consultation with the Department of
 State.  To start the process, General Cabell, then Acting Director of
 Central Intelligence, sent a letter to the Secretary of State recom-
 mending that the government initiate efforts to have Powers released.
 He cited Powers' employment by the government, his imprisonment
 as a result of his employment, and the fact that he had information
 which would be of use to the government.  He pointed out that
 according to every indication Powers' conduct had been consistent
 with his instructions.  The release of Abel, on the other hand, would
 in CIA's view not harm the interests of the United States; more could
 be gained from Powers' release than continuing to hold Abel.  This
 position was in fact agreed upon and approved by the President,
 with the proviso that Abel was not to be released until it was deter-
 mined that Powers actually had been.
 A small task force was established in CIA to plan the execution
 of the hoped-for exchange, and Donovan willingly agreed to be the
 executor. A strict need-to-know regimen was imposed; we did not
 want our hands tipped by any leaks.  Thousands of details had to be
 into the spy story as an absorbing sub-plot.  The picture of Colonel
 Abel that arises from Donovan's faithfully reported conversations with
 him is one of a dedicated, intelligent Soviet agent with a rare ability
 to adjust patiently to circumstance, a much realer person than the
 usual fictional spy.
 The first three-quarters of the book tells the story of Abel's espionage
 activity in the United States, as Donovan pieced it together after
 he was asked by the Brooklyn Bar Association to defend the Russian,
 and follows the legal case through to the final Supreme Court decision
 upholding his conviction.  Donovan's version makes the Court's de-
 cision seem even closer than the 5-4 split on it would indicate.  But
 even before the case was concluded, letters from "Mrs. Abel" to
 Donovan raised the possibility of an exchange, and Donovan's plea
 to the trial court included the argument that a death sentence should
 not be imposed because it could be useful to have a live Soviet spy
 in U.S. custody.
 That possibility was kept alive after the Supreme Court decision,
 and it became more real in May of 1960 when Francis Powers' U-2
 was shot down.  This was when that intense behind-the-scenes ac-
 tivity in CIA and other government offices began.
 Fundamentally, the objective was to free an American citizen who
 had been captured while carrying out his assigned duties.  But it
 wasn't that simple.  For a while there was not even any indication
 that he was alive, and then it was not known what he had told his
 captors.  And an answer was needed to the important operational
 question of what caused the U-2 to go down.  For months we could
 only ask ourselves how long the Russians would go on making
 propaganda hay with their prize captive and what they would do
 with him then.
 A legal position was devised under which Powers, being an agent
 of the United States, was not responsible as an individual for his
 acts.  We knew the USSR would not accept a legalism to its own dis-
 advantage, but we needed some kind of base from which to work.
 Through the Powers family and through Frank Rogers, Alex Parker,
 and William Dickson-American lawyers who sacrificed time and
 effort (and at times it seemed their reputations)-eve laid the ground-
 work for the only defense suitable for shifting the Soviet case from
 Powers to the U.S. government itself.  We thought that, while this
 defense of Powers as an employee of the government, along with the

 faced, along with major decisions such as a location for the physical
 hand-over.  And all of this without any facts from the USSR to go on.
 But we knew what we wanted and made some shrewd estimates on
 Soviet thinking.  As Donovan excitingly shows, our plan worked; but
 I doubt if anyone except him could have carried it off so handsomely.
 Donovan could not know what efforts the government had put
 into the project.  The necessary planning and coordination alone
 among State, Defense, Justice, CIA, and the White House were truly
 staggering.  From the perspective of this part of the accomplishment,
 Strangers on a Bridge becomes an even more impressive story of
 devotion to justice and the national interest.

 Rudimentary methodology for
 studying the effects of military
 programs on the Soviet economy.
 GUNS OR BUTTER PROBLEMS OF THE COLD WAR
 George Ecklund
 When a Roman commander in 50 B.C. took the men and. materials
 to throw up a fortress wall or build a new catapult, no one balanced
 this against civilian use of the resources.  Defense was paramount.
 But no organization man in Washington or Moscow today would
 think of ordering a strategic weapon system without inquiring, among
 other things, into its impact on the economy.     In this nuclear age
 both weapons and organization have become so complex, even in
 peacetime, that men must now study carefully the economic result of
 every major armaments decision.  The questions asked may range
 from the industrial implications, here and in the USSR, of disarmament
 proposals on the one hand to the effects for the Russian consumer if
 Moscow matches a Washington decision to install an expensive anti-
 missile system on the other.  This article will explore the contribution
 of economic analysis in studying the impact of alternative military
 programs and will point out some of the intelligence problems involved
 in doing it on the USSR.
 Economists recognize that in a global context the major considera-
 tions relative to disarmament or increased armament are not economic.
 Maintaining a counterpoise to the adversary in military strength; and
 political initiatives will continue to be the overriding objective over
 the next decade.  The economic problems will increase in importance
 only if the political and military problems come nearer to solution.
 But analysis of the economic impact of alternative defense budgets
 may help us understand the implications of military and political
 developments as they occur.
 It is the cost of modern armaments and the stretch-out in develop-
 merit of new military hardware that make it necessary to consider the
 economic impact of defense. The world now spends about $135 bil-
 lion annually on the war industry, roughly as much as the entire
 income of the poorer half of mankind.  The United States spends a
 little more than a third of the total, the USSR about a third, and the

 rest of the world a little less than a third. There are many competing
 demands for the resources represented by this money, for example
 increases in personal consumption, more investment to accelerate
 economic growth, war on poverty, expansion of higher education, more
 aid to developing countries.  Moreover, decisions on arms spending
 made today cannot easily be changed tomorrow by beating the swords
 into plowshares.  The Pentagon's shopping list has few items in
 common with the housewife's, and military hardware ordered two or
 three years ahead cannot be converted to patios or cabin cruisers.
 That is why a new military order, usually expensive and highly
 specialized, will affect other claimants to the nation's output for several
 years to come.
 What is needed for studying the economic impact of defense is a
 technique that will translate military spending into civilian spending
 and vice-versa, so as to forecast the effect on the structure and growth
 of all civilian sectors as the resources available to them are increased
 or decreased.  One must take into account: (1) the quality as well
 as the quantity of resources left for the civilian economy (a GI
 mustered back to an Iowa farm will not contribute as much to tech-
 nological progress as an engineer released from the Redstone arsenal
 to AT&T); (2) the regional impact of defense spending, particularly
 with respect to small cities where the phasing out of a weapons system
 may close an assembly plant, for example; (3) the speed of military-
 civilian conversions, which may aggravate the frictions developed in
 switching resources from production of household appliances, say, to
 marine turbines; (4) the differences in national abilities to adjust,
 recognizing that a taut and muscle-bound economy like the USSR's
 will not as readily absorb increased defense outlays as one with some
 unused resources and the tremendous flexibility of the American.
 Economists have not yet developed standard techniques with which
 to attack this many-faceted task, indeed have done very little pioneer-
 ing work on it.
 A Hypothetical Case: The Problems
 Military planning today requires some notion of the possible size
 and structure of the enemy's forces ten years from now and of its
 economic capability to support them.  Suppose one were speculating
 about the size of Soviet defense outlays through 1975, necessarily
 making assumptions about many things such as technological break-
 throughs and the shifting winds of coexistence.  With the USSR's
 current defense spending at about $45 billion, a plausible range of
 alternative budgets over the next decade might be from a low of
 $35 billion to a high of $75 billion (reflecting, perhaps, a great differ-
 ence in the magnitude and sophistication of strategic forces).  With
 this frame of reference established, the economic impact problems
 begin.
 First, would the $40 billion difference between the high and the
 low, if Moscow chose the latter, buy $40 billion worth of Russian
 consumption, or foreign aid, or investment in economic growth? Not
 necessarily.  It might yield more (or less) than $40 billion in addi-
 tional consumption, less (or more) than $40 billion in new investment,
 or some indeterminate addition to foreign aid.  One of the riiddles
 that research on the Soviet economy has not yet solved and must
 devote more attention to is the "exchange rate" between military and
 other spending.
 This problem illustrates a fundamental difference between the U.S.
 and Soviet economies.  In the United States a dollar is a dollar
 whether spent on military R&D or new housing, and our price system
 reflects the spending of economic resources in a way that accords
 with our national and individual desires.  Through the price system
 people vote for the goods they want, and investors plan their output
 in line with these price votes-a very efficient arrangement.  But in
 the USSR a ruble is not a ruble, because prices are set by Moscow
 without reference to consumer votes.  If more resources are needed
 for military R&D, the Soviet price system does not determine which
 sector of the civilian economy will give up these resources.  The
 decision is part of the economic plan, and the resulting shift in re-
 sources may be quite inefficient.  Thus it is difficult to determine
 whether a ruble taken from housing will buy a ruble of military R&D.
 Second, would Soviet GNP grow at the same rate under the high
 and the low military budgets?  That depends on the quantity and
 quality of men and materials left for the civilian sector and on how
 Moscow divides them between investment and consumption.  The
 quantity problem by itself is easily interpreted-sum up all the men
 and. the metal and the electronics gear ticketed for defense, and those
 resources are lost to the civilian economy.  The quality problem is
 more difficult-the kinds of men and metal preempted by defense
 will affect the rate of technological development and hence the rate
 of growth in the civilian economy.

 A, high defense budget that concentrated specialized resources on
 military research, development, production, and space activities would
 interfere seriously with the introduction of new techniques in civilian
 industry.  For example, if a disproportionate share of high-grade
 scientists and engineers are shunted to defense for several years,
 progress in developing new chemical processes and automation may
 be greatly retarded.  Economists would say that growth in "factor
 productivity"-the productivity of labor and capital, measured by
 the ratio of GNP to the input of the two combined-has slowed down
 because of pressing military needs.
 A question quite apart from the character of the military bite on
 resources is how Moscow will use those that are left, whether to
 increase (or decrease) the rate of growth of GNP by raising (or lower-
 ing) investment.  But adding a ruble to investment will subtract a
 ruble, more or less, from consumption.
 A Quantitative Method
 The concept of factor productivity is useful in expressing more
 specifically the impact on the Soviet economy of the $75 billion and
 $35 billion defense budgets.  Historically, during the long period
 1928-63, factor productivity in the USSR increased at a rate of 1.5%
 annually; but during 1950-58, when defense expenditures grew slowly,
 this rate was accelerated to a little more than 3.0%, and then during
 1958-63, when defense expenditures were stepped up, it fell to about
 1.0%.  This is the empirical basis for the following hypothesis: high
 defense expenditures preempt critical resources such as R&D and
 cause a slowdown in the growth of factor productivity.  In our hypo-
 thetical example the growth in factor productivity might be about
 1.0% with the high defense budget and about 2.0% with the low.
 The higher rate, of course, permits a faster growth of GNP.  But
 several other factors enter into the projections of GNP under the
 two defense budgets:
 (1) Moscow's decision whether to put primary emphasis in the
 civilian economy on investment or on personal consumption; if in-
 vestment is planned to increase 10% annually, the capital stock (plant
 and equipment) will grow faster than if it increases only 7%, and the
 faster capital stock grows the faster GNP will grow;
 (2) The annual growth in the labor force; this is related to the
 growth in adult population and is estimated at 1.7%;
 (3) The relative shares of labor and capital in GNP; it is estimated
 that the return to labor in the form of wages and other payments
 amounts to about 75% of GNP, and the return to capital about 25%.
 We are now ready to summarize in a table the possible impact of a
 high and a low defense budget on Soviet consumption and economic
 growth over a decade.

 growth rate) X (labor's share of GNP) -h
 (capital growth rate) X (capital's share of
 GNP)
 Substituting figures for the high military budget and priority on
 economic growth:
 GNP growth=1.0%+(1.7%) (.75)+(10%) (.25)
 =1.0%+1.275%-h2.5%
 =4.775%, rounded to 5.0%
 When the GNP growth rates have been determined, aggregate
 GNP can be projected to 1975 for each of the four cases.  Military
 expenditures and investment, as given, can then be subtracted
 from GNP to derive the only residual-consumption.
 From this quantification of economic impact it can be seen that
 the high defense budget is not compatible with a premium on economic
 growth; it would result in an annual decline of 1.0% in personal
 consumption (about 2% in per capita terms), which would be anathema

 to the Soviet leaders and their constituents.  If Moscow chose the
 high military budget for a decade, it would probably have to be
 content with a rather low rate (4%) of growth in GNP, and even then
 personal consumption would increase more slowly-3.5% annually
 in aggregate, or about 2.5% per capita-than it has during the past
 10 years.  If, on the other hand, Moscow considered the low military
 budget adequate through 1975, it could maintain a substantial growth
 in GNP (5%) and the large increase of 5% in personal consumption
 (about 4% per capita), or alternatively it could opt for a higher rate
 of growth in GNP (6%) and a more modest increase in consumption
 (3.5 %0).1
 A puzzling question still remains.  Would the high military budget
 put too much strain on the Soviet economy? The new leadership is
 already stretching resources to the limit in its grandiose plans for
 expanding agriculture, boosting consumer welfare, keeping abreast of
 the United States in space, and maintaining the image of a dynamic
 economy.  If Moscow spent $75 billion annually for defense by
 1975 it is certain that something else in the economy would have to
 give.  Could the USSR really afford such a high level of military
 spending? This question economic analysis cannot answer; it can
 say how much must be sacrificed for a given level of defense, but
 not whether the sacrifice will be made.  What a nation can be per-
 suaded to give up for defense depends on a host of sociological
 factors, including the nature and seriousness of the threat, the charisma
 of the leadership, and the cohesiveness of the people.  It is a problem
 for the combined talents of political scientists, sociologists, economists,
 and other kinds of experts.
 Although disarmament talks have made no dramatic progress, it is
 wise to think of economic impact along with the disarmament itself.
 Some of the many forms that an agreement might take are general
 and complete disarmament, halting the production of nuclear weapons
 and delivery systems, a ban on research, development, and testing of
 new weapons, reduction in conventional forces, and annual percentage

 illustrate the methodology.

 reduction in over-all defense spending.  All of these programs would
 release men and resources to the civilian economy, but some would be
 more useful to a particular economy than others.  For example, a
 country with a labor shortage might be attracted by the prospect of
 a reduction in conventional forces that would release manpower,
 whereas a technology-poor one might prefer a ban on new weapons
 development in order to free scientists and engineers for industrial
 research.  It would be useful for disarmament negotiators to know
 which possible proposals would be most attractive to the USSR, or
 Communist China, because of economic impact.
 The impact of disarmament might be likened to that of a shift in
 popularity from vacations at the beach to private swimming pools in
 the back yard.  Demand for services at Ocean City would go down,
 whereas demand for cement, excavating equipment, and local labor
 would go up.    There would be a similar shift of men and resources
 if the Pentagon were to slash its orders for aircraft and the Interior
 Department let contracts for large new dams.  In a modern, devel-
 oped economy there are dozens of industries that would be involved
 in the switch from planes to dams.  While some industries push the
 finished planes off their assembly lines, others produce only the engines
 or the tires or the radar systems, and still others make only the metal
 or only the sulphuric acid that helps make the metal.  Some sell
 primarily to other industries; some sell most of their output to final
 consumers.  How will each of these interrelated industries be affected
 if military aircraft production is banned by a disarmament agreement?
 Would the subsequent shifts in resources affect economic growth and
 personal consumption?  These are the key impact questions.
 One way of getting at the answers is through input-output analysis,
 a technique for tracing the complex adjustments that occur throughout
 a nation's industrial machine as demand for final products is cut back
 or increased at one point or another.  A large "flow table" is prepared.,
 in which each major industry is listed once as a row and once as a
 column.  The row shows how industry A sells its products to all the
 industries listed in the columns, and to final consumers in an extra
 column.  The column shows how industry A buys from all the in-
 dustries listed in the rows, and from the labor market in an extra row.
 The table thus shows, for example, the total sales of aluminum to
 the aircraft industry and as pots and pans to households.

 the highly intricate chain reaction through the industrial structure
 and measuring the resulting demands, direct and indirect, on each
 of the industries.
 Aircraft production is a comparatively trivial example.  General
 and complete disarmament would have a substantial impact, releasing
 perhaps $40 billion in resources annually to both the Soviet and the
 U.S. economy.  Input-output tables would show the kinds and amounts
 of material and the quantity of labor that would be freed for use in
 civilian industry.  This information, together with regional economic
 data, would form the basis for planning the alternative uses.  In the
 USSR the government would make all the decisions as to what re-
 sources go where and when.  But in the United States planners in
 private industry would bid for the released materials and labor, basing
 their bids on their estimates of consumer demand; the government
 would step in only if a geographic region or an industry needed out-
 side help to adjust to the new conditions.
 Another use for the input-output tables would be to evaluate the
 impact of a large increase in military expenditures.  They would show
 the additional effort required by each industry, would point to the
 kinds of civilian activities that might be cut back, and would help
 identify bottlenecks.
 To construct an input-output table for the USSR would require a
 great deal more data than is presently available to Western econo-
 mists, but fortunately the USSR has become interested enough in
 this technique to develop some large-scale tables of its own.  Parts
 of the tables for the year 1959 were published in 1962.      Russian
 books and journals have referred to nine national and nineteen
 regional input-output tables that have been constructed or are in
 preparation.  Soviet writers use input-output data widely in their
 unclassified papers, implying that the tables are circulated in the
 USSR and that economists are free to use their statistics in detail.
 Moscow may in time release some of the more extensive tables for
 other years.
 It is clear that Soviet input-output tables would be more useful to
 economic planners in Moscow than to intelligence analysts in Wash-
 ington.  The planners have to solve the problems, whereas analysts
 only identify them.  Nevertheless, the wealth of information that
 emanates from an input-output table would help the analyst measure
 the strains in the Soviet economy caused by increased defense spend-
 ing or evaluate the impact of resources rclca-t
 It is apparent from the table that in producing $25 million of steel
 for use by final consumers the steel and coal industry used up $40
 million of steel.  In other words, it takes steel to make steel and coal,
 and it takes coal and steel to produce coal.  If consumer demand for
 steel and coal should increase by $5 million each, the input-output
 technique will tell us how much additional steel, coal, and labor will
 be needed to satisfy both the increase in consumer purchases ($5 mil-
 lion each) and the additional inter-industry purchases ($? million).
 The procedure is approximately as follows: The flow table is used to
 derive a coefficient matrix, a table which shows the inputs of steel,
 coal, and labor required per dollar of steel and coal output.  We now
 ask a computer to invert the coefficient matrix and multiply it by the
 column showing the increases in consumer demand.  The resulting
 product is the total increase of steel, coal, and labor needed. If a flow
 table has 200 industries rather than 2, and if we define a calculation as
 either a multiplication or a division, inversion of the corresponding
 coefficient matrix requires about 2,500,000 calculations.
 Pentagon were to cancel its contracts for the F-ill, an
 economist with a set of input-output tables and a digital computer
 could estimate the resulting changes in every industry affected.  There
 would be a decrease in demand for steel, which in turn would require
 less sulphuric acid, less iron, less limestone, and less coal.    There
 would be a reduced demand for synthetic fibres and plastics from
 the chemical industry.  The tire industry would demand less rubber
 and less nylon and rayon.  Employment would be cut at General
 Dynamics and at some of its subcontractors and suppliers.         These
 are only a few of the ramifications from such a single cut in produc-
 tion of military aircraft.             The input-output tables are a tool for tracing

 Other Economic Impact Questions
 The ready transferability of men and factories from the military to
 the civilian sector has received relatively little attention. In the event
 of general disarmament, what amounts and kinds of the material and
 human inputs to defense could be used in the civilian economy
 (1) immediately? (2) after modification or retraining? (3) not at all?
 A number of excellent studies of this problem have been made in
 the West,2 but the few Soviet economists who have written on
 problems of disarmament substantially understate the difficulties that
 would likely be encountered in the USSR.3  The costs of transfer
 would be less in the United States than in the USSR, because our
 market mechanism will more quickly and efficiently switch resources
 to products the consumers want.  Conversion probably would cause
 more problems for the Soviet economy and require greater effort than
 is now recognized in Moscow, and some of our economic intelligence
 efforts should be directed to the specifics of the consequent dislocations
 and effects on the development of the economy.
 Educational progress has been an important factor, though difficult
 to quantify, in the rapid economic growth of the USSR.  With the
 increasing complexity of modern weapons, a greater share of the
 highly trained scientists and engineers in the USSR are now used in
 defense, and the implications of this for the future development and
 growth of civilian industry are uncertain.  In order to refine his
 impact studies, the economist needs more information on educational
 achievement in the USSR, including projections a decade ahead, and
 a better understanding of the contribution that education makes to
 economic growth.
 Economists often say that defense is a quite separate sector of the
 economy that drains resources away from other uses.  Although prima
 facie true, this assertion may ignore a possible feedback from defense
 to the civilian economy.  To what extent, if any, does technological
 know-bow developed specifically for defense benefit the civilian
 economy?   In the United States, military-space technology is often
 diffused into the civilian sector: e.g., the Y2-thousandth-inch aluminum-
 coated plastic film developed for the ECHO satellite is now used as
 a reflective insulator for very low temperature vessels; superior print-
 ing rolls have been made from the polysulfide rubber developed for
 cast solid propellants; sintered aluminum oxide ceramic, developed
 for rocket nozzles, is now used in industry for special check valves
 and resistor cores.  Little is known about interchange of technology
 in the Soviet economy between the military and civilian sectors; it is
 probably not as widespread as here.  It is an important matter to
 the economist, however, because the extent to which military R&D
 filters into the civilian sector will affect his estimate of factor pppro-
 ductivity and future growth of Soviet industry.

 The importance of anachronistic
 intelligence to supplement that
 on advanced weapon systems.
 YESTERDAY'S WEAPONS TOMORROW
 Dwayne Anderson
 The great emphasis that U.S. intelligence publications place on
 advanced weapons, in accordance with their strategic significance,
 may leave the casual reader with the impression that the Soviet mili-
 tary machine is made up of ICBM and ABM forces backed by a
 ponderous but ineffective mishmash of traditional components armed
 with elderly weapons.  His familiarity with Soviet military sites may
 include Tyuratam and Sary Shagan but probably little else.  He
 knows the Soviets still have some tube artillery, bombs, and torpedoes
 but believes these will soon be in museums alongside crossbow
 exhibits.
 Such impressions can result from rigid application of the reporting
 priority accorded developments involving missiles and from a general
 assumption that the importance of a weapon is in direct ratio to its
 complexity.  Thus superficial indications that some missile may be
 propelled by solid fuels would make the intelligence front pages,
 while good evidence that the Soviets were reequipping ground forces
 with a new and better rifle would be lucky to get in at all.
 Certainly Soviet silo digging must be carefully watched so that we
 can adjust our own strategic stance accordingly, and the Soviets'
 success or lack of success with antimissiles could have as great an
 impact on our defense budget as on theirs.  But preoccupation with
 these unquestionably important matters may have become so great
 as to skew our appreciation of over-all Soviet capabilities.  Factors
 operating to degrade the theoretical capabilities of modern weapons
 have been ignored, and important capabilities of older weapon systems
 have been overlooked or forgotten.
 Weaknesses in Complication
 The very complexity of advanced weapons is their major draw-
 back.                               They depend on highly trained personnel for maintenance and
 operation.  They must have back-up stocks of precisely manufactured
 and inspected parts.  They are almost useless if counterm

 interfere with the functioning of any of their many components.  In
 many instances they can operate only under carefully controlled
 temperature and humidity conditions, and they must have exactly
 regulated power supplies available at all times.
 Often the refire function of sophisticated systems is limited, com-
 plicated, and slow, rendering them vulnerable to saturation tactics.
 Equally often sensor capabilities lag far behind the capabilities of
 other elements and so lower the effectiveness of the entire system.
 These can also be adversely affected by physical phenomena: an
 auroral display can blank out a radar, and a school of fish can blind
 a sonar.
 Elaborate check-out systems to check out the check-out equipment,
 all of which must function perfectly, have added to the bulkiness of
 many of the newer weapons.  This may be of no great importance
 with ICBMs, but in mobile combat units it can be critical.  A costly
 antiaircraft missile had to be abandoned recently when the system
 was'found to be so bulky it could be carried only by ships of cruiser
 size.
 ]Bombers have frequently been relegated to the strategic intelligence
 boneyard on the assumption that modern air defense has done them
 in despite the development of stand-off missiles, electronic counter-
 measures, and low-altitude flight profiles.  Even if this assumption
 were correct with respect to conditions in non-nuclear general war,
 it has no validity for nuclear war.  The electromagnetic effects of
 thermonuclear and fission weapons, the clouds of radioactive debris,
 and the resultant ionization of the atmosphere would hamper the air
 defense's command and control communications and greatly reduce
 radar effectiveness.  The defensive forces might have to rely heavily
 on the human eye for warning and fire control.  The bomber, then,
 should have a reasonable life span.
 Need for Versatility
 Complexity is not the only drawback of newer weapons.  In some
 instances the weaponry they replace is better suited for certain types
 of missions.  The high speeds and limited loiter time of jet aircraft
 have led to a new appreciation of propeller planes in a variety of
 attack and reconnaissance roles.  The elderly bolt-action Springfield,
 long after it had been phased out of production, continued to perform
 as a sharpshooter's rifle because it was superior to its successors for
 this purpose.
 History is replete with examples of weapons abandoned too soon
 or with too little consideration.  The bow, phased out by the Greeks
 in Homeric times, was winning battles centuries after the city-states
 had been destroyed as political entities.  Spanish commanders of the
 early 16th century armed their tercios with the long-abandoned armor
 and short swords of the Roman legions and did quite well against their
 progressive arquebus- and pike-armed opponents.  In the Korean war
 carefully organized and coordinated U.N. amphibious operations were
 hamstrung by the North Korean expedient of dropping obsolete con-
 tact mines in coastal waters from junks and sampans.  The carrier-
 oriented U.S. Navy had to activate World War II minesweepers and
 crews to cope with this obstacle.  Most recently a whole array of
 obsolescent weapons have been dusted off and adapted to the needs
 of the unconventional fighting in Vietnam.
 During Taiwan Strait air operations in 1958, Nationalist F-86 air-
 craft battled Communist MIGs with overwhelming success despite
 the fact that the MIGs were faster and could climb more briskly.
 A few of the Nationalist aircraft were armed with Sidewinder air-to-
 air missiles, and the actions were studied to determine the effectiveness
 of this missile.  But the post mortems showed that all but a few of
 the Communist losses resulted from the Nationalist pilots' gunfire.
 Subsequently some USAF officers, noting the difficulty of maintaining
 the missile in ready condition and the limited refire capabilities of
 aircraft fitted with it, recommended that missile-carrying fighter air-
 craft be reequipped with automatic cannon for at least part of their
 armament.
 Defensive systems are particularly vulnerable to saturation effects.
 In antisubmarine warfare teams of aircraft, surface ships, and sub-
 marines, backed with shore-based sound surveillance systems, can
 present formidable opposition to one or two conventional submarines;
 but a large number of submarines scattered along a few hundred
 miles of coastline would currently pose an extremely difficult prob-
 lem.  Field and shipboard air defense missile systems can in general
 attack very few targets at a time.  Their major limitation lies in the
 guidance radars which direct the missiles during their flights.  An
 installation with two guidance radars can attack only two targets
 over a period of several minutes.  During this time other enemy
 aircraft or cruise missiles can carry out their missions without
 hindrance.

 The inflexibility of many advanced weapons, particularly those of
 mass destruction, is clear.  Essentially, they can apply force on one
 scale only, and as a rule only to certain pre-selected targets. A
 105-mm howitzer can fire one round near a target to draw attention or
 to press compliance with a demand.  If necessary, a second round
 can be fired into the target to indicate that the demand will be en-
 forced; and this can be followed, again if necessary, by twenty rounds
 to put enemy personnel in the face-saving position of having offered
 token resistance.  Finally the target can be reduced by using 100
 rounds, or whatever number is needed.
 Nuclear weapons, on the other hand, offer only one option, oblitera-
 tion of the target.                  U.S. preparations for action during the Cuban
 crisis were slowed by having to weld conventional bomb racks on
 aircraft which could otherwise have delivered only nuclear weapons.
 The presence of Minuteman and Polaris missiles of course greatly
 affects the basic rules under which engagements such as that in
 South Vietnam are carried out.  Nevertheless they cannot play any
 active role in them.
 In sum, the whole gamut of wars that may occur, from a jungle
 insurrection to a prolonged broken-back nuclear struggle, demands
 a variety of military hardware, much of which may be primitive in
 design.  National military capabilities can therefore not be measured
 just by counting mass destruction weapons or assessing the complexity
 of weapon systems.  Weaponry must be evaluated according to its
 probable performance under fire, in the face of countermeasures,
 under conditions of limited logistic and maintenance support.  It
 must be evaluated in terms of the environment and kind of war in
 which it may be used, and the attention it is to get in intelligence
 reporting should be determined accordingly.  At the present: time
 intelligence should be devoting more effort to the evaluation of
 Soviet and Chinese Communist capabilities with respect to support
 for the kind of fighting being done, for example, in Vietnam,.
 A Range of Wars
 Present mutual deterrent policies of the United States and the
 Soviet Union are unlikely to be affected by less than extreme changes
 in the relative numbers or capabilities of ICBMs or other major
 weapons.  This being the case, it may be more important to learn
 how quickly and in what numbers the Soviets can send heavy infantry
 weapons to the Congo than to know the vernier characteristics of the
 SS-8 propulsion system.  It may even be more important to know
 Soviet capabilities for low-altitude conventional bombing than the
 precise yield of certain Soviet fission weapons.
 Finally, it may be more useful to know the quantities and types of
 equipment that have been stockpiled or mothballed than to know
 every detail about the first-line hardware.  The scrapping of the battle-
 ship fleet and near elimination of eight-inch guns on cruisers had led
 to a serious decline in U.S. capabilities for giving fire support to
 amphibious operations.  Recently, however, the Navy pulled rocket-
 equipped LST's of World War II vintage out of moth balls to rectify
 this deficiency.  Knowing whether the Soviets could similarly remedy
 certain weaknesses on short notice may prove critical in our assess-
 ments of Bloc courses of action in Africa and Asia.

 Some case histories of disaffection among
 Chinese Communists trusted abroad and
 some common factors therein.
 Henry Flooks
 As the number of Chinese Communists stationed abroad or sent
 out on tours with delegations increases, the possibility of walk-ins
 and the opportunities to stimulate defections increase accordingly.  In
 an effort to give some definition to the characteristics of such possibili-
 ties, the score or so of defections that were attempted or effected by
 Chinese personnel in the foreign environment up through mid-1964
 have been studied.  It has been possible to draw a few generalizations
 about motivation, deterrents, and procedure, centering on the Chi-
 nese sense of mutual obligation between protecting authority and
 protected vassal.
 A half dozen of the most instructive cases are presented in capsule
 below.  Names have been changed where necessary to protect sensi-
 tive information.
 Frustrated Penetration Agent
 In Japanese-occupied Manchuria Lao Keng-nung was a college
 student. His father was a secret Kuomintang agent working against
 the occupier.  Lao came of age and graduated about the time of
 the Japanese surrender, and the ruthless arrogance of the conquering
 Russian troops disgusted him; it was the Kuomintang, the Chinese
 government, that really deserved the credit for driving the Japanese
 out.  But when Mao Tse-tung's troops followed not long after, he was
 much impressed by their considerate treatment of the people, even
 helpfulness.  He was also pleased with the Communist land reform
 measures and Mao's program in general, and so, without objection
 from his father, he went to work for the Party.
 In 1949, when all mainland China became the Chinese People's
 Republic in alliance with the Soviet Union, and anti-Russian elements
 were being suppressed, Lao indiscreetly spoke up in defense of a
 Russian-hater who was being purged from the Party.  He pointed
 out how the Russians had dismantled Manchurian industrial plants
 and carted them off.  The upshot was that he had to engage in self-

 criticism and write a confession.  Yet his misconduct was handled
 with such seeming earnestness and logic that the incident left no bad
 taste in his mouth.  Nor in the Party's: his confession was accepted
 and his status cleared of any cloud.  He married a Party member
 at about this time.
 Lao's particular Party organ was the United Front Work Depart-
 ment.  In 1951 the UFWD asked him to undertake a deep-cover
 mission to Taiwan.   He balked.  It would not be safe; a lot of people
 on Taiwan knew him by sight and knew he was a Party man, and
 sooner or later someone would recognize him.  It took strong and
 lengthy argument, but he finally convinced his superiors that he
 should be sent to Hong Kong instead.  He took his wife along.
 In Hong Kong he had a case officer named Wei, who transmitted
 UFWD instructions and his reports and passed him a small salary
 to supplement what he could earn in a cover job; but operationally
 he was left pretty much to his own devices.  His mission was to
 penetrate the Chinese Third Force group there which opposed both
 the Communists and the Nationalists.  After much difficulty he landed
 a job as reporter for a Third Force newspaper.  He was to write
 exposes unmasking Communist double-dealing and showing how ruth-
 less the Party was.  The trouble was, Wei refused him permission
 to write about Party secrets, even when they were well known out-
 side, and wouldn't approve articles that put the Party in a too un-
 favorable light.  His colorless copy was therefore rarely accepted,
 and he made no progress toward getting inside the Third Force.  This
 lack of accomplishment in his mission, in turn, made the UFWD more
 and more dissatisfied with him.
 Early in 1953 Wei told him bluntly that if his work didn't improve
 he would be recalled to China to explain his failures. Alternatively
 he could go to Taiwan as originally scheduled.  Frustrated and re-
 sentful, Lao now began to question privately the decency of a Party
 that would insist on the dangerous mission to Taiwan, impose im-
 possible conditions and then punish for failure, encourage mutual
 distrust among people, and throw a man out when it had got all the
 use it could out of him.  Undoubtedly Mao was the greatest leader
 China had had in modern times; but the apparatus, especially in its
 international aspect, was too rigid, dogmatic, and intolerant, too much
 afraid of criticism.  More particularly, it disregarded its obligations
 to those who served it loyally.
 Approved
 In June and July Lao had several stiff arguments with 'Wei.
 Taiwan, he was told, was still open to him, but his usefulness here
 in Hong Kong was zero, and his Party salary would accordingly be
 that from now on.  This was the crunch.  For the first time he dis-
 cussed the situation with his wife.  They could go on to Taiwan and
 turn themselves in as soon as they got there.  But they really had
 no sympathy with the Kuomintang, did not trust it, and further were
 not confident Taiwan would hold out against the Communists.  They
 could ask asylum of the Crown Colony authorities; but the British
 were friendly enough with the People's Republic that that might not be
 safe.  Moreover, the long arm of violent Communist justice might
 reach them if they deserted and stayed in Hong Kong.
 The third course lay to the U.S. consulate, and they took it. The
 United States was strong enough to protect them from any enemy.
 On 18 July Lao wrote a careful letter to the consulate-in Chinese,
 his only foreign language being a bit of Japanese-saying that he
 had been doing clandestine work for the Party but no longer believed
 in it and wanted to work against it; he had important information for
 the Americans.  He particularly stressed his wanting to work against
 the Communists and the importance of the information he had.  He
 assumed that he would be valuable enough in U.S. eyes to be offered
 sanctuary; and he was right.
 Premeditated Abduction
 Chung Jen-lung was a member of the Youth League and a student
 at Peking's Institute of International Relations.  He wasn't particu-
 larly fond of political science; he'd have preferred medicine, and he
 rather resented the arbitrary way the Communists had made the
 choice for him.  In fact, although he wasn't foolish enough to let on
 to anybody, he resented Communist authoritarianism generally;, and
 he had fallen into the habit of tending to believe the opposite of
 what they told people to believe.
 Take America, which they painted so black.  A cousin of his had
 learned a lot about it when he worked for an American aid mission,
 and he had talked of it as a prosperous, generous land where anyone
 with ability could find fulfillment.  He himself had seen something
 of American generosity in the rehabilitation of Manchuria, after the
 Russian plundering.  That was before the Communists came in and.
 swallowed up his family's money in the new China's universa' . egali-
 tarian poverty.  And now at the Institute he was able to read trans-

 lations from the American and European press; the bad capitalists,
 he observed, told you what was so, while the righteous Communists
 told you what they thought was good for you to think.
 At the end of 1958, when he was graduating from the Institute
 and preparing for a study tour in Southeast Asia-to polish up his
 language skills-he came across a London Times story about the young
 pianist Fu Tsung, just escaped to England.  Fu, it seemed, in Warsaw
 on a scholarship, had made some critical remarks about the suppres-
 sion of the Hungarian uprising.  Later someone had tattled on him
 and he was ordered home.  What "labor reform" might do to a pianist's
 handsl  His escape seemed so simple.  That's for me, thought Chung,
 but America, not England.
 The first chance was at the Hong Kong stop en route to his South-
 east Asian post.  But Chung had the impression that only embassies,
 not consulates, could grant political asylum, and he didn't want to
 make any false breaks.  Even when he reached his post he spent
 a week getting the lay of the land and writing up a bitter denuncia-
 tion of the Communists with which to sell himself to the Americans.
 Then one day when everyone else was leaving the Chinese hostel
 to go to work at the embassy, he begged off, saying he had to finish
 up some homework first. As soon as they were out of sight he walked
 a few blocks away and took a pedicab to a corner near the U.S.
 embassy.
 Chung had no doubt that the Americans would be happy to re-
 ceive him, but he was conscious of violating his obligation to his
 family.  They would surely be made to suffer in one way or another
 if they had nurtured a defector.  He had therefore taken care to
 leave his papers and personal effects spread out as though he had been
 kidnapped while in the midst of work.  At the U.S. embassy he
 begged that his whereabouts be concealed, and he steadfastly refused
 to be used in any propaganda play.  He even denied knowing how
 to reach a brother of his in the Chinese air force.
 Cultured Misfit
 Tung Chi-p'ing's family, in Shanghai, though mentally well en-
 dowed, was an unhappy one.  The father was a niggardly and callous
 man who got what he could out of his wife and children and sub-
 ordinates without doing anything for them in return.  He suffered
 financially when the Communists took over, but as the children grew
 up they fared quite well, though they had no interest in the new
 Approved
 ideology.  Two brothers got good jobs in factories in the area.  One
 sister became a college teacher and married a physicist.  The other
 married a Foreign Trade officer; she was the only one to join the
 Youth League.  Tung's ideal for himself was the cultivated intellec-
 tual, and he pointed his schooling to this end.
 In 1957, in the course of a rectification campaign, several of Tuing's
 middle school teachers were sentenced to labor reform, and he felt
 keenly the injustice and the degradation of it.  Then came the futility
 and mismanagement of the Great Leap Forward; he himself was put
 to work at a backyard steel furnace.  The Communists were like his
 father, driving you and then not taking care of you.  But he did like
 school.  He had a particular interest in the ways of the outside
 world; he was fascinated to learn that the French National Assembly
 could reject the EDC treaty after the French government had signed
 it, and he stood at the top of his class in Russian studies.
 He was therefore given a chance at the entrance examinations for
 the Shanghai Foreign Language Institute, passed with flying colors,
 and put to studying French.  Here he had a teacher, born in England
 of a French mother and Chinese father, whom he greatly admired for
 her competence and knowledge of life abroad (life in such contrast
 to the grinding poverty all around him here, especially starting with
 the bleak winter of 1960-61).  She had once been put in jail for
 associating with a foreign missionary-another bit of crude oppres-
 sion by those that represented the unfeeling masses.  Then there
 were those endless indoctrination sessions of the Party's that took time
 away from higher learning.     He got himself branded a "backward
 element" for disdaining political study and Youth League membershiip.
 He emerged from the Institute in September 1963 as a French
 expert and was put on the staff of the Commission for Cultural Rela-
 tions with Foreign Countries.                                                                                                       More disillusionment.  He did! once
 get to interpret for Guinean President Sekou Toure', but that was the
 one bright spot in day after day of menial drudgery, making travel
 arrangements for visiting delegations and submitting routine reports,
 and moreover getting criticized for being late with these.  Was it
 for this he had sharpened his wit and enriched his mind in the bright
 world of French literature?
 He decided to make an escape when he could.  There were some
 jobs in China that would offer a satisfying life and work, but these
 were all held by old Party hands; no chance for a young man, espe-
 cially without Party pull.  Nor was he interested in Chian

 regime, with its corruption and nepotism.  No, he would go West,
 where his ability would be rewarded. He didn't let his family in
 on this decision; he no longer felt close to them.  But he wanted
 to show the people he most respected that he was not going to
 succumb to frustration here, and he told his old French teacher and
 several of his classmates.  They kept his secret.
 His chance came the following spring, May 1964, when he was
 sent as assistant cultural attache to Burundi with the flattering ex-
 planation that the need for French-speaking representatives was so
 acute that they just had to use him in spite of his being only 24 years
 old, inexperienced, and politically backward.  He would have left
 the plane the first time it stopped at a city that had an American
 embassy if he had known any English; he'd better wait until he got
 to the former Belgian trust territory.  In Bujumbura he spent one
 night at the Chinese embassy, then next morning after breakfast
 disappeared.
 When Wu Nai-chi was four years old his father, an army officer,
 was killed, and he was brought up by a rather too indulgent mother.
 The family was now quite poor, but it enjoyed the protection of the
 father's former commanding officer, a warlord in Yunnan.  A year or
 so after the Japanese were defeated, when Wu was in his early
 twenties and ambitious to become a doctor, this patron sent him to
 the United States for schooling.
 He enrolled in pre-med courses but didn't buckle down to them.
 His fellow Chinese students were rather ashamed of him.  He
 gambled a great deal, was forever in debt and trying to borrow more
 money.  He had girl trouble more serious than normal; once the
 Chinese embassy had to arrange an out-of-court settlement for him.
 No medical school would accept him.  A friend introduced him to
 Communism; he began to read Communist literature and grew
 progressively more leftist.  Finally, in 1951, another friend persuaded
 him to go back to China and "devote himself to the socialist revo-
 lution."
 In China he was given a six-month indoctrination course and then
 assigned an English instructorship in the Institute of Foreign Lan-
 guages.  He became a probationary member of the Party and married
 a Party girl.  Faced with the realities of Communism in practice,
 he never wavered in his belief in it.  He remained convinced that
 Approved
 socialism was the best system for a backward country like China;elthme
 Chinese needed a paternalistic, authoritarian regime.  An overwh-
 ing majority of them supported this or..  It was doing wonders in
 health and education; it had liberated Tibet.  He only regretted its
 anti-Americanism, because otherwise China might qualify for Ameri-
 can aid, as some other Communist countries had.
 In the summer of 1958 his turn came for the intellectuals' 1:our of duty
 at manual labor.  He had to work for a year on a collective farm, then
 three months at a backyard steel furnace.  This he approved too, and
 he took pleasure in being commended publicly for his performance
 on the labor tour. When it was over, in October 1959, he was sent
 to the Middle East to hold Chinese language classes for Arab stu-
 dents.  He had to leave his wife behind with the children, but this
 did not bother him much. A rift had grown between them.  She
 was such a militant Communist that she had told the Party her husband
 had an unprogressive attitude.
 And it was true.  Although Wu retained his firm faith in the
 Party's program for China, he personally had by now had about all
 he could take of it. He was fed up with having absolutely no free-
 dom of ideas, expression, or action.  Even the Arabs were better
 off.  He couldn't stand the thought of another session of self-criticism
 at which everyone was passed around "the same old piece of gum
 to chew and each in turn praised it as absolutely delicious."  (At one
 session he had picked up the wrong piece of gum: praising Khru-
 shchev's program of peaceful coexistence and disarmament, he was
 jumped on for his backward thinking and thereby learned that all
 was not well with the Sino-Soviet alliance.)  He recalled the laissez-
 faire intellectual atmosphere in America.  He spent more and more
 time listening to the Voice of America and BBC (which the Party
 approved for the sake of keeping up his English) and reading English
 news magazines (which it did not).  He especially liked a BBC pro-
 gram that compared what Communists said with what they did.
 After much debate with himself, particularly on the point of desert-
 ing his family, Wu decided in the spring of 1960 to give up and have
 another try at life in America.  He was sure he could hold up his
 end of the deal this time.  At 37 he was still young enough to start
 anew, and he had the advantages of knowing English and of his pre-
 vious experience.  He decided to wait until the end of the school
 term.  That would neatly round out his
 Appra WyEa?   Base 2005/01/05 : C
 students; moreover, the lump-sum check for his services he would
 get then might come in handy.
 Like most Chinese would-be defectors abroad overtly or under
 official, cover, Wu had some purely tactical obstacles to overcome
 in order to carry the act off.  For one thing, it required some sur-
 reptitious research just to find out where the U.S. embassy was,
 though this was not a serious problem if you had plenty of time, as
 he had.  More difficult was the Party practice of seeing to it that no
 one was ever left by himself in this dangerous foreign world; Wu
 was always accompanied to and from school by another instructor
 named Hsieh.  He did get away long enough to telephone the U.S.
 embassy that he had information to offer and would like to set up a
 rendezvous with an American in a car; he was told he would have
 to come to the embassy.  This he managed by asynchronizing haircuts.
 On the last day of school he took there with him, packed in his
 briefcase, his toothbrush and shaving kit and a change of underwear.
 On the way home, after picking up their checks, he and Hsieh stopped
 at the bank and cashed them.  Then he said he had to have a haircut
 and suggested that Hsieh, who had just had one, could while away
 the time in the bookstore here while he went around the corner to the
 barber shop.  When Hsieh agreed and went into the bookstore, Wu
 took a taxi to the U.S. embassy.  The Arab guard stopped him at the
 door, but he lied that he was Japanese and was let through.  He ex-
 plained his situation to an embassy officer and asked if he could stay
 in the building overnight and be flown to the United States the next
 day "on a Pan-American Bight."
 Then the blow.  They could not possibly give him asylum on the
 spur of the moment like this; such a decision would have to be made
 in Washington, and even if favorable it would take several days at
 best.  Stunned, he raced back to the bookstore.  Hsieh was gone;
 it had been almost two hours.  So back to the Chinese embassy,
 devising on the way a story of how he had gone from one barber shop
 to another trying to find one without a crowd of people waiting for
 haircuts.  He was desperate enough to be convincing, and it worked.
 Realizing now that defecting was more complicated than he had
 thought, Wu resolved to lay some preliminary groundwork next time.
 The following spring he learned he was being sent home that summer
 for leave and reindoctrination.  Supposing that he would travel via
 Hong Kong, he tried to make contact with the British, first talking to
 h     '  char e of a local library that was not off limits for

 him and Hsieh.  This man didn't want to get involved in political
 intrigue; he suggested the British embassy.  Wu was still trying to
 get away long enough to follow this up when he learned that he was
 routed through Athens on a northerly flight instead of Hong Kong
 after all.
 Wu and the steadfast Hsieh emplaned, June 1961, under an injunc-
 tion to stay aboard during the Athens stop.                                                                                                               But the day was hot,
 even on the Aegean, and it seemed sensible to go into the terminal
 building for a cool drink.  Once inside, Wu used the pretext of a
 visit to the rest room to get out of sight, and then he just kept on
 going.  As the plane's departure was announced, Hsieh made a frantic
 search for him, but at the last minute he gave up
 flight taking him home to face the music.
 Persistent Juggler
 Yang Shao-heng was born, in 1937, into an acrobatic troupe where
 everyone was a relative or an in-law.  In the old China acrobats were
 a free-wheeling lot living hand to mouth, and they didn't change much
 when the Communists took over.  They were poor enough to be
 good proletarians, but they were too gypsyish and wild.  Yang's
 troupe was given some indoctrination, and a brother-in-law of his
 who took it more seriously than most of them was made security
 officer on their travels.  But by Communist standards discipline was
 pretty loose.
 Yang became a juggler.  The juggler section was headed by another
 brother-in-law, and Yang found himself more and more irked by these
 two, the boss who threw his weight around on the job and the secu-
 rity officer who poked his nose into what you were doing off of it.
 He caught some glimpses of a freer life; in Hong Kong the movies
 were for fun, not about how to "build socialism," and people really
 lived.  In 1959 they had a tour around Latin America, and this was
 an eye-opener.  He began to think about jumping the traces.  The
 trouble would be earning a living, knowing only Chinese and how
 to juggle.  Well, the Chinese would like juggling on Taiwan.
 In the spring of 1963 the cultural exchange program gave the troupe
 a trip to the Sudan.  On the first day in Khartoum they had a. guided
 tour of the city, and among the places pointed out was a Sudanese
 "Refugee Aid Headquarters."  That did it.  In the wee hours of the
 next morning Yang sneaked out of the hotel and walked to the Head-
 quarters.  He managed to get across to a guard on duty there that

 he wanted asylum, and the guard made him understand that he would
 have to come during office hours. Disappointed, he tried to sneak
 back into the hotel just before daybreak, but the security brother-in-
 law was awake.
 Ile was bawled out: he had been expressly warned not to get in-
 volved with women here, and the first thing he did was stay out all
 nightl  He would have to have a watch set on him.  And watched
 he was; no chance for a daytime search for refuge.  But by the next
 evening they had relaxed enough so he could get away shortly after
 midnight.  By chance or deliberately, people were working at the
 Headquarters, but the only Chinese interpreter available knew nothing
 but Fukienese and no characters.  He didn't do any better than the
 guard had on the first trip, but he did know a proper Chinese linguist
 who could be there the following evening.  It was conveyed to Yang
 that he should come again at 10 p.m. the next day.
 Back at the hotel things really popped this time.  Within 48 hours
 Yang was to have ready a full confession about his insubordination
 and a program for disciplining himself in the future; in the meantime
 he would be under continuous surveillance, even while in the bath-
 room.  Yet that very evening, while the whole troupe was getting
 ready to go on stage for an 8:30 performance, he succeeded in slip-
 ping out a back door and keeping his appointment.  The third time
 was a charm.
 Security Officer
 Chao Fu was born in Manchuria to a family that for generations
 had been poor peasants.  He was only about ten when the Russians
 drove out the Japanese and brought in the Communists; Chiang
 Kai-shek and the Nationalists meant nothing to him.  At seventeen,
 with his peasant background and having shown in two years of middle
 school that he was quite bright, he was selected for special training.
 He was sent to military school, made a full member of the Party, and
 rotated through various positions in the public security administration.
 He married the girl his mother had selected for him in the traditional
 way; he found her an adequate wife.  In 1960, twenty-five years old,
 he was put through a one-semester course at the Advanced Civil
 Police Cadre School in Peking and then sent to Stockholm as security
 officer for the embassy.  He had to leave his wife and baby at home.
 It was something of a shock for him to find that Sweden was not
 really a country of poor slaves mercilessly driven to support the dis-
 Approved
 solute idleness of rich capitalists.  And in addition to the workers'
 prosperity, he also observed with envy the freedom which the Swedes,
 as well as the foreigners in other embassies, had to come and go as
 they pleased, make friends outside their own circle, and generally
 choose their own way of life.  If life had been regimented back home,
 it was much worse here in the embassy: no social mingling outside,
 no female companionship, and nothing to do in your spare time but
 play ping-pong, watch a movie once a week, or go on a rare picnic
 when the weather was right.
 And back home things seemed to be getting worse all the time.
 Just before he left, a cousin who worked in an auto factory had told
 him it hadn't produced any trucks for a year except a few thrown
 together for Cuba which he doubted would run; now he heard that
 the cousin had been laid off for lack of work and sent back to farm-
 ing.                                                                                                           In 1961 the embassy cashier had a few months' leave in China.
 When he came back he had lost 20 pounds, and when someone com-
 plained about the portions of meat served at dinner he bitterly pointed
 out that in China anything containing a piece of meat the size of your
 fingertip is called a meat dish.  In 1962 the embassy cook got a letter
 from home with such a distressing description of hunger and want
 that he cried as he read it aloud to the others.
 Chao frequently lay awake at night comparing life as lie knew it
 in China with what he could see around him in Sweden.  The Com-
 munists had let China down; they had failed.  The grass didn't just
 look greener on this side of the fence; it was incomparably greener.
 He had heard that not long before he got to Stockholm the embassy
 administrative officer had simply disappeared.  They suspected a
 defection, but since no news of him came from the West or anywhere,
 they didn't even have to acknowledge he was missing, just took his
 name off the diplomatic list the next year.  That way he didn't dis-
 grace his family back home and cause them to suffer, either.
 Chao had been thinking secretly along these lines for several months
 when, in July 1962, he heard that the embassy was getting a ,personnel
 cut in the course of an economy drive.  His own security officer posi-
 tion was vulnerable; it wasn't a full-time job, and he was assigned all
 sorts of leg work and errand-running to round it out.  The prospect
 of being dumped and sent back home decided him.  But he couldn't
 really just disappear: he would need legal status, concealment, some
 way to earn a living.  There wasn't any reason why the neutral Swedes

 should give him these.  He would seek the protection of the Com-
 munists' arch-enemies, the Americans.
 He had long since discovered, in the course of outside errands,
 where the American embassy was, and one day he had a chance to go
 by it.  He went in.  Alas, no one there could speak Chinese.  Casting
 about, he thought of an American Chinese he had known.  A few
 days later, when he was supposed to be running an errand on the
 other side of town, he met him at the railroad station. This man
 advised him to get out of Sweden.
 As luck would have it, a party from the Chinese embassy was meet-
 ing a train at the time and saw this encounter, and reported it.  Chao
 tried to explain it away but was not convincing.  He was confined
 to his room.  After everyone was asleep that night, he managed to
 slip out, taking a pistol and the keys to an embassy car.  He drove out
 into the countryside.  He stopped at farmhouses, trying to establish
 that he was suffering from amnesia after a car accident.  A woman
 gave him a cup of coffee.
 Finally he took a train to Denmark, and from there he walked and
 hitchhiked until he reached the Americans in Germany.      The Chinese
 embassy had meanwhile notified the Swedish police he was missing,
 saying he'd hurt his head in an accident and disappeared.  So he
 wrote a letter to his wife back home in China, telling her that he had
 run over a man and killed him and had. therefore gone into hiding to

 Now he was confident the family would not
 Those Left Behind
 Although the Chinese never admit such defections to the outside
 world, keeping them quiet if they can and otherwise usually charging
 abduction, within the delegations and installations where they have
 occurred they earnestly discuss them in meeting after meeting, trying
 to explain how they could happen and seeking ways to guard against
 them in the future.  The case histories, moreover, are posed at in-
 doctrination sessions in other installations as object lessons from which
 to take warning.  The kinds of explanations and remedies offered at
 these meetings and in less formal discussions among the comrades are
 also instructive.
 Recently a member of a Chinese delegation abroad, a man we shall
 call Chen, tried to break away from the delegation and get to the
 U.S. embassy, failed,- and was immediately sent back to China.  The
 Approved
 rest of the delegation were then moved from their hotel into the
 Chinese embassy, and there they held several group meetings.  A
 later defector has reported what went on at some of these meetings.
 The delegates were anxious lest Chen's action be held against the
 rest of them and prevent them from going abroad again.  They took
 comfort in the ambassador's report on the incident, which tried to
 absolve them of serious blame.
 Speaking in turn, nevertheless, they admitted that if Chen had
 been properly watched, his disaffection could have revealed itself
 and the attempted defection been prevented.  They stressed the need
 to tighten the bond between the delegation leaders and other mem-
 bers; proper leadership would have prevented Chen from straying
 about and being contaminated by outside influences.  Yet everyone,
 not just the leadership, was at fault to some extent. Chen was not
 basically bad; he had been entrapped by evil influences. No one had
 stopped him when he visited prostitutes in several countries, and these
 women had been agents of the dirty and unscrupulous U.S. imperial-
 ists, who will do anything to achieve their aims.  One of the delega-
 tion leaders, it was reported, summed up the sentiments of the group
 something like this:
 "In order to get us, the enemy uses all means. If someone, par-
 ticularly a young comrade, has a weakness or unhealthy thoughts,
 he can fall into the enemy's trap.  Chen's conduct was not generated
 in one day, and backward thinking is not spontaneous or accidental.
 He had this dangerous frame of mind some time before it came into
 the open and must have revealed somehow to intimate friends some
 sign of his intended action.  We were lacking in political knowledge
 and alertness not to have seen such signs.  Everybody is responsible
 in part for what happened."
 The members of the diplomatic installation, according to our de-
 fector, also analyzed among themselves this case and others of poten-
 tial, abortive, or successful defection-among them Chao Fu's and
 the earlier one from the embassy in Sweden, a "high-level cadre" in
 Cuba, one Chang Chien-yu who in 1959 had defected in Bombay and
 redefected the next morning, our juggler Yang Shao-heng, pianist
 Fu Tsung who had fled to England, a chauffeur in England who
 visited houses of prostitution on the way back from the airport but
 was caught at it in time.  Speakers pointed out by hindsight the signs
 of potential defection which closer watching would have revealed.

 The ill consequences for the defector were also stressed, on the re-
 defector Chang Chien-yu along these lines:
 "Chang wouldn't have come back if they had promised to let him
 settle down in America.  Instead, they told him he would first be
 sent to America to have some training and get married to a beautiful
 American woman, and then sent back to Asia to do intelligence work.
 The poor fellow was scared to death to learn that he would have to
 face the Chinese again.  He pondered over his predicament and his
 future and made up his mind."
 In a similar vein of Chao Fu: "He will regret doing that.  Of course
 he will.,  After they have pumped all the information out of him, he
 will be kicked out and his sorrow will begin.  I imagine he was told
 that he will get some training in America and then be sent back to
 Asia to work for them."  Of juggler Yang Shao-heng it was said that
 the imperialists had exploited him for propaganda purposes and then
 pawned. him off on the Kuomintang on Taiwan and forgotten about
 him.
 Much discussion was devoted to the danger of Kuomintang or im-
 perialist agents, especially women.  Chen had been seen in unauthor-
 ized conversation with a "tall foreigner" before his attempt.  The U.S.
 embassy had Chinese-speaking officials who were especially engaged
 in this sort of thing.  Chao Fu's predecessor in defection in Sweden
 had been contacted by a "beautiful woman."  A member of this
 embassy had recently been approached by an English woman on the
 street and asked about his job.  Another told about an Italian woman
 who had invited a colleague of his to her room; she wanted money.
 In Switzerland women followed you around wherever you went, said
 another.  An American woman in a very scanty bathing suit had
 flirted with another at a swimming pool.  For that reason yet another
 never went to the swimming pool with fewer than two companions.
 A defector from another Chinese diplomatic mission has reported
 how the principal officers discussed the defection of one Chu Heng-
 pan, secretary of a mission in West Europe, to the USSR.  The chief
 was deeply concerned in particular over the question of the responsi-
 bility of a chief of mission for defections, considered as a failure in
 leadership.  After speculating about what might have gone wrong
 and comparing the case with six or eight previous defections in vari-
 ous countries, he turned to the question of prevention and began to
 go through the list of his own staff:
 Approved
 acquired a verAy pretty wife, which should eliminate the possibility
 for him.  But about Comrade C there is something that nobody
 knows.  As for D, if she goes back to China she should not be allowed
 to travel by herself; nobody questions her loyalty, but we have to
 take precautions for her safety.  Then there are three blue-collar
 workers we will have to watch, along with E.  And F and C have
 to go out on official business, and very often they do not have anyone
 with them.
 "Another bad thing is that when a chauffeur takes someone some-
 place, very often he comes back by himself and is completely out of
 control. In a country like this there are many material attractions,
 and we at the head will just have to set a good example.  It is my
 responsibility, of course, to check on people's thoughts and political
 consciousness, but how are you going to do it.  The man who has
 wrong thoughts will be the very one to hide them and cover lip."
 In regard to Chu, the responsibility was similarly laid largely upon
 the leadership of his mission.  Chu had probably had correct ideologi-
 cal views at the time of his assignment abroad, it was said, because
 his political reliability would have been thoroughly investigated be-
 fore he was allowed to leave China.  His deviation then began abroad
 and grew gradually over the years until he finally became a traitor.
 The mission leaders must have known that he had been indulging in
 personal and material amenities, and it had been wrong not to take
 corrective measures.
 But the foreign ministry's personnel management was also at fault
 for allowing him to remain abroad for six or seven years.  Being
 away so long, he had not undergone a full-scale thought reform since
 the 3-Anti and 5-Anti rectification campaigns of the mid-fifties, and
 so he lacked the ideological strength to counteract the insidious in-
 fluence of the bourgeois world.  Diplomats had a special problem in
 that they associated primarily with the upper classes in the host coun-
 try and so did not get a true picture of the decadence of bourgeois
 society.
 In discussing this mission's own preventive measures it was re-
 marked that it would be impossible to watch everyone 24 hours a
 day, but they should try to keep as close track of each other as
 possible.  The most important preventive measures were to strengthen
 thought reform and completely eradicate individualism, and as a
 check to require detailed reports of all social

 Chinese Defections                             Chinese Defections
 with foreigners.  Throughout this discussion little distinction was
 made between "bourgeois" and "revisionist."  Chu was corrupted by
 the bourgeois environment in West Europe so that he defected to the
 Russian revisionists.  Speakers used the two terms almost inter-
 changeably in referring to alien influences by which they might be
 entrapped.
 The defectors have invariably claimed to be ideologically motivated,
 particularly when they first walked in,  They doubtless feel this
 explanation to be the most eye-catching for convincing Western
 officials that they are worthy of political asylum, but the initial em-
 phasis on ideological disaffection is by no means a ruse.  Until the
 moment of defection they have been immersed-if unwillingly-in an
 ideological world.  In rejecting this environment so thoroughly im-
 bued with ideological pressures, the totality of the rejection empha-
 sizes, conversely, the same pressures.  Deeper probing during the
 course of debriefing has revealed that almost all have indeed been
 dissatisfied with some aspects of the Chinese Communist political
 system, but in most cases what has bothered them has been practical
 consequences of the regime's program-its failure to take due care
 of its subjects or the restrictions it imposes on personal freedom-
 rather than the ideology proper. In addition, there has usually been
 some pressing personal problem to trigger the defection-failure on
 the job, dread of an assignment to manual labor, imminent recall, etc.
 More than half the defectors were less than 30 years old, and with
 two or three exceptions all were under 40.  None had achieved such
 high positions that they defected at great sacrifice of status.  It would
 be of importance to be young enough to have reasonable hope for a
 successful new start in life.  One-quarter of the score, curiously, came
 originally from Manchuria, and three had got an unfavorable im-
 pression of the Russian occupation there.                       The rest lived all over
 China.
 Only one defector, Chao Fu, came from a real peasant family.
 Several others were very poor, but they were from urban areas and
 so had more exposure to modern life than the average poor peasant.
 One obvious consideration in examining backgrounds as a clue to
 vulnerabilities is that anyone whose personal history would make
 him look like a non-conformist or troublemaker would not be sent
 abroad.  The nearest case to an exception here was French linguist
 'l'ung.
 The defectors' average educational level was fairly high.  None
 was illiterate; even juggler Yang had been taught to read and write
 by members of his family.  Most had some kind of status in ~`he
 Party.  The high percentage of Party members, like the educational
 level, probably reflects only criteria for selecting Chinese to be sent
 abroad.  Knowledge of foreign languages also seems surprisingly
 irrelevant to the defections. Only one spoke English, and about half
 spoke only Chinese.
 Family ties are probably the strongest deterrent to defection, as
 the Chinese Communists themselves recognize.  The number of offi-
 cial Chinese abroad accompanied by their entire families, always
 small, has decreased even further in recent years.  Though the main
 reason for this is probably the one given officially---economy--det.er-
 rence from defection is also a consideration.  Of these defectors, two
 intelligence officers working under deep cover and a few others were
 able to bring their wives and children out with them.  Others, though
 not close to their families, felt the traditional obligation toward them
 and tried to protect them by their manner of defection, as by staging
 amnesia or kidnapping.  Others were completely alienated from their
 families.
 Most of the defectors had had some contact with non-Chinese in-
 fluences before their final assignment abroad, and most had consider-
 able opportunity to observe life outside China.  Western publications
 and radio broadcasts were of secondary significance in one or two
 cases.  All those who walked into U.S. installations felt that the
 United States was the strongest and most determined antagonist of
 Communist China and could provide them the greatest security.  The
 economic opportunities in America were not ignored, but at least
 superficially they were less important than the security of a sanctuary.
 A characteristic of most Chinese seems to be a particular need
 for sanctuary, for the protection of a strong authority to which in
 turn they give obedience, deference, and loyalty.  This need is filled
 in their society by the traditional family system, and it may help
 explain both their allegiance to the authoritarian Communist Party
 and their disaffection when it fails in its reciprocal obligation..  They
 tend to be docile before superiors, dictatorial with inferiors, and un-
 comfortable when treated as equals.  When the defector breaks away

 from the system that has been his life, his most pressing need is for
 another sanctuary, a new authority that will give him protection as
 well as exact obedience from him. He needs and wants a clear
 understanding of what his obligations to this new protector are.
 This is our best lever for getting him to undertake intelligence mis-
 sions like working for us in place.
 Knowledge of previous successful defections provided encourage-
 ment in several of these cases, though it seems not to have been a
 decisive factor.  None had any substantial knowledge about how
 previous defectors had been received.  We have no information as
 to whether knowledge of unsuccessful attempts or difficulties previous
 defectors have faced has ever deterred a Chinese from defecting, as
 the Communists seek to make it do.
 Only one defection was the direct result of a relationship with a
 woman in the host country.  But it seems clear that the enforced
 celibacy of most of the Chinese abroad is perturbing to them as a
 vulnerability of which they are aware.
 'Three of the defectors at one time or other threatened suicide,
 and three others seemed emotionally disturbed or in the midst of
 some sort of psychological crisis.  Although the very fact of defecting
 suggests a failure to adjust, however, the majority were moved by
 quite rational considerations.  Most weighed the alternatives care-
 fully before defecting.
 Only four of the defectors had some realistic idea about how they
 might be received and made their first approach to U.S. authorities
 in such manner, time, and place that they could immediately be
 accommodated.  Three others seem to have had no great problem
 once they got in touch with other Western authorities.  But all the
 rest had difficulty finding a way to defect, and some failed altogether.
 Mere knowledge of a place where they could defect was a critical
 factor in many cases.  Language was often a barrier.    The tactical
 difficulties are aggravated by security measures consciously taken
 by the Communists.
 There is a standing rule in all Chinese Communist installations
 that no one may go outside alone except on official business.  This
 rule is strictly enforced.  The efficacy of the rule is illustrated by
 the difficulty many of the defectors found in breaking away and even
 in netting the address of a Western installation.  Another security
 measure is to lock up passports in safes.  At least four of these de-
 fectors had had their passports locked up.
 Wherever possible, traveling Chinese are routed through cities
 where official Chinese installations are located, and these installations
 are notified to meet the travelers at the airport.  This is done "to
 avoid kidnapping."
 When there is any reason for suspicion, a preventive measure is
 confinement within the installation, and the ultimate one
 to China.
 A Few Inferences
 These security practices have several implications for us.  When
 a defector walks in, the chances are strong that he will have made a
 considerable effort and taken considerable risks in breaking away;
 he may not always be able to do so again.  There is a strong chance
 that walk-ins will have inadequate or no identification.  If a defector
 agrees to go back and remain in place, it is highly possible that at a
 later time he may be confined to the installation or even taken out
 of the country under guard.
 No attempted defection has been demonstrated to be a provocation.
 To set up a Chinese official in such a way that he would look attrac-
 tive to a Western intelligence service and then willingly place him
 in its hands would require both a realistic estimate of the reception
 he would receive and complete trust in the individual.  The Chinese
 Communists have yet to show they can meet these requirements.
 Although the Chinese criteria for selecting personnel for foreign
 duty are heavily "political," in the Communist sense of the word,
 the process of screening, being an inexact science, will occasionally
 permit a wrong-thinking, individualistic, or potentially unreliable
 person to go abroad.  The process is also compromised by practical
 necessities; a person's technical qualifications may counterbalance a
 less than perfect security assessment.
 Political theory per se appears to play little part in defection.
 More important is whether the system based on the theory is com-
 patible with the Chinese social tradition, conforms to the individual's
 sense of what is right, or seems effective in practice.  The regime's
 preventive measures against defection, ranging from ideological to
 physical, seem sometimes themselves to help create doubts about the
 system.

 As would be expected, self-interest, both individual and family,
 can make or break a defection.  Lack of strong family ties, assessment
 of future possibilities for a reasonably good life, and personal and
 political problems-present or potential-all appear as basic mo-
 tivations.
 COMMUNICATIONS TO THE EDITORS
 Station Helgoland
 Dear Sirs:
 Thanks are due Anthony Quibble for drawing attention to Frank
 Lynder's Spione in Hamburg and au f Helgoland: Neuentdeckte
 Geheimdokumente aus der Napoleonischen Zeit.1  Not only is it of
 historical interest, but its day-by-day record of the Helgoland opera-
 tion strikes a responsive chord in any reader engaged in the intelli-
 gence business today.
 For instance, note the early use of a ploy now favored by the Soviet
 intelligence services for documenting illegals in the authentic identities
 of innocent citizens living or dead.  Father Robertson's memoirs
 relate how, after his black entry onto the continent by smuggling
 boat, he betook himself to the Bremen City Hall to obtain a travel
 pass.  "I had long since thought up a false name," his account con-
 tinues.  "In London I had known a German, who had since died.  He
 had left his homeland as a child and had never gone back.  I re-
 membered the name of his birthplace and the fact that all of his
 relatives were now dead, and so I adopted his name in order to make
 my transformation complete.  I had also written to the pastor of his
 village some time before, requesting written confirmation of 'my' birth
 there.  The pastor complied without further ado.  I thus identified
 myself as `Adam Rorauer, language teacher' and laid the evidence
 before the Bremen City Hall official.  As I went to sign ray name,
 I began, from habit, with the J of my first name, James.
 "'What's this?' cried the official.  `You've just said your name is
 Adam l'
 "Whereupon I told him that in my homeland Bavaria almost all
 of us have the extra first name Johannes; and he gave me my passport
 and the visa."

 only serve to dramatize the difficulty; for me, at least, their well-
 reasoned suggestions do not quite bridge the gap between idea and
 ideography.
 But one might possibly build on their efforts and advance the
 search a bit farther.  I wanted to take from them the solid thought
 of pairing Latin roots as in "transcreder" and the sound advice about
 avoiding the implication of "personal, selfish motivations."  At least
 one root, it seemed, should have associations almost universally
 favorable in any culture, as "libertarian" was meant to do.  Then
 I tried to start from such concepts as seeking and taking sanctuary.
 From this circuitous contemplation a word did spring to mind.
 May I respectfully suggest superpatriate?  Its possible perversion
 into "super-patriot" does not escape me, but I believe any word would
 contain the seeds of its own "invidious or comical perversion." I
 hope at least to have helped keep this important word-hunt going
 until we bring one back alive.

 Operational Approach to Soviets
 Dear Sirs:
 The Winter issue of the Studies reached me out here in the field
 only the other day, and I hope it is not too late to tell you how much
 I admire your journal and author Martin L. Brabour:ne for the
 straightforwardness with which you presented his thesis.4  As a past
 contributor and one of the sources cited by Brabourne (page 40,
 footnote 3), I would like to make a general observation on a related
 point that I believe important for our future ability to manipulate
 Soviet personalities.
 Brabourne's thesis, quite correct, is that we are most likely to reap
 a good intelligence harvest from among the well-placed neurotics
 of Soviet society.  To date, at any rate, it is these human misfits
 who have constituted our major successes; and they may continue
 to do so for years to come.  At the same time, I would like to suggest
 a case for the "normal" Soviet citizen as an object of our operational
 interest.
 I believe I have met and observed as many individual Soviets as
 anyone in the intelligence community, and under a great variety of
 circumstances.  Very few of these have been from the diplomatic
 or military services, but all have had one unvarying characteristic:
 they have been educated people.  Quite aside from the interests of
 the Soviet intelligence services, these Soviets have subjected me and
 others like me to their own curious personal observation: So this is
 an American.    What kind of person is he?  How does he act, speak,
 behave socially, think?  What kind of an impression does he make?
 Does his behavior confirm or refute what we hear officially about
 Americans?  And so on.
 Without gainsaying Brabourne's contention that the best intelligence
 target is the Soviet nervous-breakdown-going-somewhere--to-happen, I
 suggest that it is equally important to make a good impression on
 these average, often well-placed Soviets.  This is really the key

 element in our so-called covert action, capable of being taken by
 any one of us in a most overt way. The trick is simple: we put
 forward, at all times, the best foot of the intelligent American.
 One of the personality details that impressed me about Soviet
 Colonel Oleg Penkovskiy was that for some years his very model
 of the modern American was Colonel X, a U.S. Army officer who
 had served a tour in Turkey concurrently with his own service there.
 Ile told one of our operations officers that Colonel X was the man
 he most respected and most wished to emulate.  (It was an un-
 expected irony when we later learned that Colonel X could remember
 neither Penkovskiy's name nor his face.)
 If we can't recruit these Soviets, why bother with them?  Well,
 it could be this approach will recruit some Soviets some day; who
 can say it won't?  But short of that, good impressions made on
 thoughtful Soviets by thoughtful Americans may well influence them
 toward a less intransigent policy line in their work in the Foreign
 Ministry, the Defense Ministry, on Pravda or Radio Moscow, perhaps
 even within the diabolical schemings of Party subcommittees.  Such
 indirect effects can but be salutary.
 Brabourne cautioned against disregard for courtesy and the amenities
 in our relations with Soviets.  I take this one step further, urging
 a positive effort to make the best impression that correct and intelli-
 gent deportment can.  No one has to go out of his way in order to
 gain respect, and approaching the Soviets in this manner doesn't
 take one cent of operational funds.
 And this suggestion need not be limited to Soviets.  Colleagues
 involved with the Cubans, the Congo, or Cambodia may find therein
 some comparable application.

 THE HOTEL IN OPERATIONS
 James J. Lagrone
 Hotels have been used for years by case officers for meetings and
 other purposes, but the recent world-wide proliferation of larger
 and more modern hotels, often used by the local governments for
 official meetings and state visitors, has increased operational interest
 in them.  If a case officer knows the basic systems and operating
 procedures of a hotel he is working in or against, he is more likely
 to be able to do the job without attracting attention.  Although a
 hotel staff is rarely looking for intelligence activities as such, it is
 constantly on the lookout for bad credit risks, thieves, sexual deviates,
 organized prostitution, and any activities that may disturb the guests
 or damage the hotel physically.  In watching for such things, an
 alert employee can easily trip up a case officer who through careless-
 ness or ignorance attracts undue attention.
 The following describes the systems used by large hotels to check
 and control their guests and then examines the staff positions from
 the viewpoint of the desirability of different employees as agents
 for operational tasks.  Any hotel of more than 100 rooms will. neces-
 sarily have procedures which more or less parallel those discussed
 here.  A given hotel may be more strictly or more laxly run, but
 it would be wise always to assume full application of the control
 procedures.  In a smaller hotel, with fewer guests and a tighter staff,
 it can be assumed that little passes unnoticed.  (An exception is the
 U.S.-style motel, whose layout complicates control and observation.)
 It is safe to say, then, that any hazard pointed out in the following
 paragraphs will be even more difficult for a case officer in a smaller
 establishment.
 On arrival the guest fills in a registration form giving his name,
 address, passport number, etc.  (In some countries he must still turn
 over the passport for a short time for registration with the local
 police.)  This information the front office staff transfers to an ac-

 counting card, called a folio, used to record charges made to the
 guest during his stay.  The ribbon copy of the folio goes to the
 cashier or credit department, but a carbon is retained by the front
 desk in a card-index file usually called a room rack.
 If any problem concerning a room comes to the Assistant Manager's
 attention, the room rack is immediately checked to see who is in the
 room and what he represents.  The information on the folio can thus
 be of critical importance in reassuring the management so that it
 lets the matter drop there or causing it to investigate further.  For
 no single slight irregularity is likely to create a hazard for the case
 officer, but mysterious noises or comings and goings from his room
 might, in combination with poor credit implications on his card, lead
 to a, thorough investigation.  Some of the credit indications and other
 features of the folio's content are the following:
 Name and address.  Many hotels keep in their credit offices phone
 directories of every large city in Europe, Canada, and the United
 States.  If a guest's name does not show up in the appropriate phone
 book it is not seriously damaging, but it does not help his credit rating.
 A fictitious company name or business address would naturally be
 worse.
 Reservations.  The folio records whether a reservation had been
 made before arrival.  If the case officer can plan ahead the time
 he is to spend in a hotel, it is well worth his effort to make a reserva-
 tion some time in advance, preferably through a travel agency as
 backing for his credit status.  Next best is to make the reservation
 personally by mail or telephone a week or so ahead.  But even one
 made a day or two before arrival gives status better than a walk-in's.
 Room choice and price.  It is an axiom in the hotel business that
 occupants of the higher-priced rooms (particularly the corner suites,
 which are often used for entertainment) can get away with more
 noise and strange activity than ordinary guests.  One should be care-
 ful, however, not to take an expensive room without proper attention
 to the establishment of a good credit impression, for high charges
 against an undetermined credit rating will arouse the concern of any
 credit manager.
 Credit cards.  The room clerk will often tactfully ask for these on
 registration.  If not, the case officer would do well to show them
 casually, if the situation allows, as a good way of establishing his
 credit and avoiding the prying eyes of the credit manager.  He does
 not have to charge on a credit card, just let the front desk record

 the data.  He could even flash a false credit card on arrival and then
 settle his bill by cash when leaving.
 Luggage.  The old jokes about one-night stands with a hat-box
 for the girl and a toothbrush for the man are really quite true; the
 notation "light luggage" is a warning signal in all hotels.  Usually the
 room clerk or the bellman reports this condition to the Assistant
 Manager on duty or the Night Manager, and an entry is made on the
 room rack folio.  The case officer could devise a story of a missed
 plane or some other explanation; but a suitcase, even filled with
 nothing but dirty clothes, would avoid the whole issue.
 Special arrangements.  In large hotels it is more common than may
 be recognized that "special arrangements" are made for a guest.
 These may concern diet,- laundry service, or a wide range of con-
 veniences.  One of operational interest provides for holding; incoming
 telephone calls and informing the guest who is calling.  Another is
 a "no information" arrangement: it is noted on the room rack and
 at the telephone switchboard that if anyone inquires for the guest
 he is to be told there is no record of him.  A request for this service
 would not strike the hotel staff as anything out of the ordinary.
 Mr. and Mrs.  If a woman is involved in the operation and must
 come to the hotel, it is best either to have her take a separate room
 or to register her as the case officer's wife. No matter how improbable
 the couple, the Mr.-and-Mrs. registration is better than none.  Hotel
 managers, acutely aware that lawsuits and other troubles can result
 from harassment of couples who may turn out to be really married,
 normally accept such a registration without prying.  But an un-
 registered woman's comings and goings will be noted by the hotel
 staff, particularly after early evening (or later if there is an upstairs
 or roof-top night club or restaurant patronized by outsiders).
 Day use.  Room occupancy, at a reduced rate, for one day and
 up to 6 p.m. only is generally encouraged by hotels for the extra
 revenue it brings in.  It is practiced almost exclusively by businessmen
 for meetings and other such purposes.  As for any registration, a
 normal reservation, naturally with a business address, is desirable.
 Out-of-town women sometimes take day-use rooms when shopping in
 the city; but the unaccompanied female in a hotel is always scru-
 tinized more closely than a man.  In most hotels tape recorders and
 typewriters can be rented in conjunction with day-use rooms.  It is
 a good idea to take advantage of this service, whether to use the

 Procedures During Occupancy
 suspicious she will tell her Floor Housekeeper, who will report it
 to the front office.  The front office will then usually telephone the
 occupant or stop him the next time he is at the desk and ask whether
 anyone is staying with him.  The penalty would usually be only an
 extra charge for double occupancy, but the staff's attention has thus
 been attracted.  It would be better either to register the double or to
 be careful to remove any evidence before the maid enters.
 Because of the theft problem, maids are constantly under close
 supervision by the management and security staffs.  Unless a maid
 is a thief she will therefore rarely try to open any luggage or even
 drawers, and a room is fairly secure if all telltale equipment and
 papers are locked up in luggage while she is there.  If someone must
 be in the room continuously, he should give the maid some excuse
 such as a headache.  The grapevine in a hotel is extremely fast and
 effective, and anything unusual will be passed on by word of mouth
 until it arouses the management's suspicion.   Although a guest who
 remains constantly in his room violates no hotel rule, he thus invites
 investigation.
 Room service, laundry boys, and other service personnel. will enter
 a room only if called.  But they are notoriously observant, and the
 room should be cleared of anything unusual before they are called.
 In the matter of services it is also hazardous to charge too much
 on a hotel bill.  If a credit card has been presented on registering,
 it may be all right to charge a reasonable amount to the room; but
 if credit standing has not been firmly established, any sizable
 charges-say more than $25 in one day-would come to the attention
 of the Credit Manager.  It is his job to review daily any, bills that
 seem to be getting unduly large.  Even with credit established,
 excesses in the use of room service and charging to the room are
 bound to attract attention.
 If a case officer or his agent is to stay a long time in the hotel so
 that his bill will be large, it is imperative that he establish a good
 credit impression at the outset.  (This may be a particular problem
 when an agent's hotel bill is to be paid not by him but by mail.  A
 business letter making the arrangement in advance is the ideal solu-
 tion, but short of that a personal visit to the Credit Manager before
 a large bill piles up is advisable.)  During a long stay, an interim
 bill may appear in one's room or front desk letterbox.  ']['his is ordi-
 narily intended as a reminder of the size of the account, not as a hard
 demand for payment.  But it is an excellent idea, if you get such a
 In a large hotel, especially if it is full to capacity, one can get away
 with almost anything for about 24 hours, short of continuous loud
 noises.  A hotel staff is usually stretched very thin when all rooms
 are occupied, when ceremonial affairs bring in many dignitaries, or
 when they are serving large banquets.  Moreover, the management
 will generally not take any action against a guest until it has monitored
 his behavior for a reasonable time.
 In going about his business in his room, the case officer should keep
 in mind two chief hazards.  First, the only way to prevent physical
 entry by members of the hotel staff is the chain latch, the ordinary
 lock being no bar to them.  Maids, bellmen, and assistant managers,
 particularly in Europe, make a common practice of entering without
 knocking.  Second, whatever the soundproofing of walls, ceiling, and
 floor, the room door is a weak point in the insulation and the place
 ,",here a staff member's ear will promptly be cocked if suspicion or
 interest is aroused.
 Moreover, the staff has legitimate need to enter from time to time,
 the maids daily.  There is no surer way to draw attention to a room
 than to hang a "Do Not Disturb" notice permanently on the doorknob.
 After about eight hours it will be brought to the attention of the Head
 Housekeeper, who may ask the Assistant Manager to make sure no
 accident has befallen the guest.  Complete isolation can be arranged
 for a period by calling the front desk and giving some pretext for
 requesting freedom from all disturbances including phone calls.  Such
 a request, recorded at the front desk and passed on to the House-
 keeping Department, will give perhaps 24 hours without interruptions
 from the hotel staff.
 When the maid enters a room she wants to make it up quickly
 and get out; she usually has more work than she can handle.        As
 long as nothing arouses her special interest, therefore, she will do
 her job and leave.  (Beware the maid who stops and talks.         She
 disobeys a strict rule in saying more than "Good day" to a guest-and
 probably has a purpose in it, to solicit "business," perhaps, or get
 information.)  She is responsible, while straightening up the room,
 for checking evidence (beds, toothbrushes, etc.) that two or more
 people are using one registered as a single.  If she sees anything

 notice, to inform the front desk how much longer you will be staying
 and ask if they would like you to pay the bill up to date.  This will
 make a good impression on the Credit Manager, who gets some of his
 ulcers from guests that are never seen while their bills run up into
 the hundreds of dollars.
 No telephone in a hotel can be trusted.  During the day, when
 the operators are busy, calls are only occasionally monitored; but at
 night, when phone traffic is light, it is common for the operators to
 monitor all conversations, even internal ones between rooms.  Long-
 distance calls they usually monitor at all hours of the day, particu-
 larly when the charges are reversed.  These practices, the result of
 police requirements and hotel efforts to control organized prostitution,
 together with operators' curiosity and boredom, are world-wide. The
 rule about increased snooping at night applies, incidentally, to other
 employees than the operators: the staff tends to be busy during the
 day with its regular work, but its inquisitiveness and capacity for
 observation go up sharply after six p.m. and practically double
 after ten.
 Should a guest fall under suspicion for any reason, the usual pro-
 cedure is as follows: The Assistant Manager is alerted during the day,
 or the Night Manager at night.  Before taking any action, he usu-
 ally tries to verify whatever was reported by sending hotel security
 officers to check the room involved. If the room is occupied they
 will listen outside and mount a surveillance in the hall (usually stand-
 ing near the elevators as if waiting for a car),  If they think that
 something may be wrong, the Assistant Manager will then come to
 inquire or investigate what is going on inside.
 The case officer's best defense against such an investigation is of
 course to avoid creating any suspicion in the first place.  But if the
 Assistant Manager or Night Manager presents himself at the door,
 reasonable answers to any questions will usually end the inquiry.
 The importance of the often-forgotten cover story is clearly evident
 here.  If nothing else works, a last resort is to show pure outrage.
 A demand for the Manager will at least win some time, for even at
 this stage the hotel staff will be nervous about pushing too hard.
 A mistake would be very hard for them to explain, and people staying
 in large hotels often have money and connections.  Thus a bold front
 can stop the Assistant or Night Manager at the door and force him to
 get the Manager or the police, or both, in order to gain entry.
 If a room is unoccupied when the investigation is first mounted, it
 may be entered and searched.  Then if suspicions appear to be con-
 firmed it might be double-locked with a special key that turns the
 night latch from the outside and prevents the guest from reentering on
 his own.  So if a case officer returns to his room and finds that his key
 will no longer open the door, it may mean that it has been pur-
 posely double-locked.  He then has the choice of going down to the
 front desk, where a problem could be waiting, or skipping out and
 abandoning whatever effects he has in the room.
 Keys and Security
 Hotel keys are usually controlled by the Manager's office or the
 Security Department. There are the following types:
 Grand Master.  This key will open all the rooms in the hotel.  It is
 controlled as strictly as possible; only the Manager and Department
 Heads have copies of their own.  The Night and Assistant Managers
 share one, passing it from one to another as they come on duty.
 Floor Master.  This is the key the maids carry; it opens all guest
 rooms on one floor.  Each maid takes a key from the Housekeeping
 Department office when she starts work, carries it fastened around) her
 waist, and turns it in at the end of her shift.
 Section Master. Usually intended for maintenance workers, this
 key opens all maintenance doors in one area.  Copies are controlled
 by the Engineering Department.
 Room Keys.  These are controlled by the front desk; there are
 usually at least four for each room.
 Individual hotel locks can usually be changed a maximum of four
 times before the grand master has to be changed, a prohibitively
 expensive job. In practice the individual locks are infrequently
 changed even when copies of the keys are lost.  It is an excellent
 idea to build up a collection of keys from a hotel which is of special
 operational interest.  By billeting staff personnel, transients, and agent
 contacts in it you can collect a good assortment over a period of time.
 Each key means at least entry to one room, and enough keys from
 one floor may give an expert locksmith the clues he needs to re-
 produce the floor master.  If enough floors are represented in the
 collection, even the grand master can be fabricated.
 Although the regulations of most large hotels clearly provide for
 strict control of keys, the strictness varies widely in different hotels

 according to enforcement measures taken by the Manager and the
 Chief Security Officer.  Since keys become status symbols among the
 hotel staff they tend to show up in the possession of some personnel
 not entitled to them, but just what irregularities one might find in an
 individual hotel cannot be predicted.
 The hotel security forces almost always have close links with the
 local police; the Chief Security Officer and most of his staff are usu-
 ally ex-policemen.  The two groups exchange information regularly,
 and the local authorities seldom take any action in the hotel without
 the knowledge and cooperation of the Chief Security Officer.  The
 Security Department has a twofold mission, to protect the hotel and
 to protect the guests; and its staff is divided into two corresponding
 sections.  Those guarding the hotel usually have uniforms, while
 those concerned with guest relations more often wear plain clothes
 or inconspicuous jackets supplied by the hotel.  The plain-clothes
 types, nevertheless, are as a rule easily recognizable, for they stay
 in the lobby near the Assistant Manager's desk when not sent off on
 some special duty, and they stand out prominently when the lobby
 is not crowded.  The uniformed guards, on the other hand, move
 about: the hotel according to a regular pattern; they are more con-
 cerned with checking entrances and fire exits and other physical
 security matters than with monitoring guests' activities.
 In general, the more intelligent officers of the security staff are
 assigned to the section concerned with guest relations.  It is worth
 remembering that the status of all the security officers except the
 Chief' is rather low.  Although they may pretend to some authority
 in dealing with guests, there is actually very little that they are
 empowered to do.       They are only aides to the management and
 rarely allowed to act independently.  Although they are often not
 armed, it is best to assume they are.
 The position of "house detective" is more or less peculiar to the
 United States.  It is often filled by a licensed private investigator.
 Ile may be granted a considerable independence of action compared
 with ordinary security officers, and he is generally armed.
 Agent Potential
 It would of course be highly desirable to have a recruitment on
 the staff of any hotel regarded as a target in audio or other operations.
 (This fact is so evident that we must assume other intelligence
 services in the area will also be trying to acquire assets on the staff.)
 The following paragraphs describe in some detail the attributes of
 the various positions, their work functions, their status in the admin-
 istrative setup, and their potential for intelligence purposes.  It 'will
 be noted that none of the positions from the "back of the house"
 are included, such as those in the kitchen, restaurants, or steward
 department.  These, which usually have little or no access to upper
 floors of the hotel, are not worth examining.
 Before we proceed to look at the individual positions, we should
 note a few characteristics of hotel staffs in general.  The pay for
 hotel employees is fairly low at practically all levels.  By giving
 free meals and supplying uniforms hotels are often able to offer lower
 salaries than they would otherwise have to. This situation increases
 the importance of the practice of tipping.  Throughout the entire
 spectrum of hotel transactions, various kinds of tips, kickbacks, and
 commissions are customary.  Some are more overt than others, but
 personnel from the Manager down to the restaurant bus boy are
 accustomed to getting a monetary reward for any extra service.
 This being the case, the typical hotel employee exhibits two interest-
 ing characteristics: he is usually short of money, and he expects
 to make extra income by performing various services for superiors
 or guests.  He therefore might tend to be more susceptible to ap-
 proaches by intelligence officers and perhaps easier to recruit and
 control than many other employee types of comparable operational
 interest.
 Front Desk and Office
 Room Clerk.  This is the man behind the front desk who, registers
 new guests. He must be presentable and fairly fluent in ]languages
 spoken by the hotel's usual clientele.  Often he is a young man,
 just starting out in the business, and receives very little pay.  His
 status in the hotel is rather low-a little higher than a secretary-
 and he has no authorized access to keys or rooms. He can be useful,
 however, in that he knows who is in the hotel, when VIP's will arrive,
 and which rooms they probably will occupy.  He also has enough
 latitude in room assignments to place an ordinary guest in a room
 of his choice.  He is usually well plugged into the hotel grapevine
 and knows many details about the activities of guests and staff alike.
 Senior Night Clerk.  Usually the most competent room clerk, he
 has command of the front desk during the night, a position in which
 he works closely with the Night Manager.  His duties are more

 extensive than those of an ordinary room clerk; he may even look
 into minor troubles in upstairs rooms if the Night Manager wishes.
 He has no official access to keys but can get any key he desires for
 a short period.  He has the operational potential of a room clerk
 plus a degree of mobility at night that would make him more useful
 than the latter.
 Front Office Manager. This is the head man behind the front desk.
 He usually works a normal day and is not in the hotel at night.
 As a department head, he has his own grand master key and may
 move through the hotel at his discretion without question.  Usually,
 however, his job keeps him tied to the front office.  Besides having
 somewhat better access in the hotel than his subordinates, he attends
 the top management's monthly or weekly meetings where the hotel's
 activities are reviewed and discussed.
 Hotel Services
 Bellman.  Although traditionally the eyes and ears of a hotel, the
 bellman is not ordinarily an attractive agent prospect.  He spends
 much of his time in the lobby, leaving it only on specific errands
 such as carrying luggage for the guests.  Any long absence would come
 to the attention of his fellow bellmen and his Captain or Head Bell-
 man.  He has no direct access to keys, receiving room keys only
 in connection with check-ins and occasionally a floor master from
 the Captain for delivering or getting something from a room.  His
 pay is very small, but tips still make the job attractive.  His greatest
 potential for operations lies in the fact that he is somehow always
 tuned to the grapevine and knows a vast amount about the hotel,
 staff, and guests.  One drawback to using him is that management
 watches him constantly for signs of theft, graft, or pimping.
 Head Bellman or Bell Captain. This is an operationally interesting
 position whose incumbent ordinarily has contacts for getting anything
 the hotel's guests may want-show tickets, plane reservations, special
 restaurant tables, rented cars, guides, women.  These activities of
 his are usually known to the management; he operates with their
 blessing.  Thus he has both extensive connections on the outside
 and a good deal of authority within the hotel, particularly at lower
 levels.  He receives many kinds of favors and kickbacks and makes
 in all good money.  Moreover, he keeps a close eye on the activities
 of the service staff, bellmen, elevator operators, and doormen, using
 an iron hand to prevent their engaging in any of his sidelines with
 the guests.  He does not ordinarily have access to a grand master
 key but has the next best thing; copies of the floor masters are kept
 at his station for bell service to all guest rooms.  Although he himself
 seldom has reason to leave the lobby or go to a guest's room, his
 authority over the other bellmen might make him an ideall primary
 agent. With the right operational flair, he could get his subordinates
 to carry out intelligence tasks without difficulty, for he alone controls
 their activities.
 Room Service. Room service personnel do not have the high poten-
 tial as recruits they might seem to at first glance.  These waiters are
 under the strict control of the kitchen; a special Room Service Man-
 ager, the Chief Steward, or a sous-chef always keeps an eye on their
 activities, especially the amount of time they spend away from the
 kitchen.  None of the waiters has access to keys, and all are watched
 closely by hotel security for signs of thieving.  Their only real opera-
 tional potential lies in being tuned to the hotel grapevine and being
 able to enter guests' rooms upon routine request.
 Housekeeping Department
 Maid.     Like the room service waiters, hotel maids would seem
 promising as agents; they spend most of every day inside guests'
 rooms.   There are several cracks, however, in this initial picture.
 In any hotel the maid is one of the most carefully watched employees
 because of her unusually good opportunities to engage in petty theft,
 spotting for real burglary, and prostitution.  She rarely controls which
 floor she will work on any given day, being assigned where she is
 most needed.  She usually has a floor master for the area, as many
 as 15 to 18 rooms on one or two floors.  The Floor Housekeepers are
 responsible for keeping each maid under close supervision while she
 works and for checking her work carefully.       A maid is likely to be
 not overly intelligent and is relatively expendable; she can be fired
 without much ceremony if her immediate superiors are at all dis-
 satisfied with her work. In summary, both her low status on the staff
 and the closeness with which she is watched limit her utility.
 Floor Housekeeper.  This is a senior maid who controlls several
 floors during the day, overseeing the ordinary maids there.  She makes
 out various daily reports for the housekeeping and front offices, record-
 ing rooms occupied, the number of people in each room, and other
 data.  She is a cut or two above her maids in natural ability and is
 usually experienced in the hotel as well. Unlike the maids, she always
 supervises the same floor. Her access to keys is on a par with other

 maids'-floor masters for her area.  Her salary is rather low.  She
 has an operational potential similar to that of a Bell Captain in con-
 trolling the activities of several maids.             But she has more mobility
 herself and can enter guests' rooms on her floors with comparative
 ease.  Within the limits of her floor assignment, her access is sur-
 passed only by the Head Housekeeper's.
 Night Maid, Night Floor Housekeeper.  These perform the same
 general duties as their daytime counterparts, but there are usually
 fewer of them.  This means that they will ordinarily have larger
 areas of access and be freer from direct supervision.
 Head Housekeeper. This seems to be one of the best positions in
 the hotel for operational exploitation.  The position is always filled
 by a woman, usually one between 30 and 50.  Often she will have
 got her experience in other hotels, and she may even be entirely
 foreign to the country, having been brought in especially to fill this
 job, considered quite an important one by hotel management.  Thus
 she may belong to the small segment of the staff which is profes-
 sional, not just recruited from local labor sources.            She may be wid-
 owed, divorced, or single; she usually lives in the hotel.  She is prob-
 ably more a woman of the world than other women on the staff and
 more susceptible to approach and cultivation than a maid.
 As a department head, the Head Housekeeper has her own grand
 master key.  She is very knowledgeable of hotel activities and plan-
 ning.  Above all, she has unlimited access to the guest floors and
 need never explain her doings there, for she must keep constant check
 on the Floor Housekeepers' and maids' performance.  Anything the
 maids or Floor Housekeepers report concerning the guests comes to
 her 'before anyone else, and at her discretion she may deal with it
 herself or pass it to the Assistant Manager.  Another noteworthy fact
 is that she controls all room furnishings, lamps, and appliances, which
 are replaced by her department as necessary.  Her position is of such
 importance in the hotel and her cooperation with Security so
 in controlling the maids that she herself is almost immune
 security observation.  Her 100% access to the guest rooms is,
 ever, pretty much limited to daytime; she rarely works at night.
 Management
 close
 from
 how-
 Assistant Managers.  This position is somewhat ambiguous, ranging
 from a glorified floorwalker's in some cases to one ranking above the
 Front Office Manager in others; it all depends on the Manager's
 desires.  But even when he has no power to make any real decisions,
 the Assistant Manager remains one of the more attractive operational
 targets.  During the day he will always be in nominal control of the
 security officers on duty and will be the man to whom the Head
 Housekeeper reports any problems that need investigation upstairs.
 In addition, he usually makes at least one room inspection daily to
 check on the Housekeeping Department.  His access to keys is not
 as good as that of a department head, in that the on-duty grand
 master which he uses is passed to his relief, who must see and sign
 for it.  But during his time on duty each Assistant Manager has
 complete control of the key.  His position in the top echelon of
 management-even though at the bottom of it-also gives him quite
 a bit of freedom from direct supervision. His superior may be either

 ing on the hotel's policy, but he has more or less a free hand in deal-

 quite serious occurs.  His pay is usually the lowest at management

 free to visit and investigate the upper floors as the situation requires.
 Night Manager.  During the day there are usually three or four
 Assistant Managers who follow one another on duty somewhat like
 changes of a military guard.  But at 11 p.m. the Night Manager
 takes on the combined duties of Manager, Assistant Manager, Front
 Office Manager, and Chief Security Officer until 8 a.m.  He thus
 rolls more functions into one person than any of the other managerial
 officers.  Working at hours when most of the remaining staff are off,
 he has complete control while on duty.  It is evident that he is one
 of the most promising recruitment targets in any hotel.  His access
 with the rotating grand master key is limited only by the fact that
 he must not be away from the lobby too long at a time.   Any serious
 action the hotel takes against a guest at night is initiated and con-
 trolled by the Night Manager.  The security officers on dirty, like
 the rest of the night staff, answer to him for all their activities.  He
 is usually a professional of some years' experience in the hotel busi-
 ness. He almost invariably likes this position for "the freedom of action
 and decision it gives, and the challenge of handling the many varied
 problems that develop in a big hotel at night.

 is akin to that of a ship captain, almost absolute.  He is personally
 responsible to the owners for the profitable and orderly functioning
 of the hotel and within that framework is more or less at liberty to
 run it as he sees fit.  Like anyone in such a top management position,
 however, he is somewhat removed from the hotel's day-to-day routines,

 Proposed planning guide in four
 phases of "national liberation" wars.
 THE INTELLIGENCE ROLE IN
 COUNTERINSURGENCY
 Walter Steinmeyer
 Experience during the past decade in Cuba, the Dominican Repub-
 lic, Indochina, the Congo, and other such hot spots has been varie-
 gated enough to provide some ground for generalizing about the role
 an intelligence agency should play in the U.S. effort to combat "wars
 of national liberation." This is the field in which U.S. security is
 for some time to come, under conditions of nuclear stalemate, most
 likely to be challenged, as the Soviet Union, Red China, and Cuba
 exploit for their own purposes dissension, turmoil, and impatience
 for reform in Latin America, Africa, the Near East, and Southeast
 Asia.  No set of rules can be universally applicable to all the diverse
 situations that now exist and will arise, but an outline of the part
 a civilian clandestine service should take in helping meet these chal-
 lenges can at least serve as point of departure in preparing, to con-
 front a particular one of them.  To suggest such an outline is the
 purpose of this article.
 Cadre Phase
 The Communist-instigated "war of liberation" begins with a period
 in which the local Communist party or the local residenturas of
 the KGB or Chinese or Cuban intelligence service are spotting, assess-
 ing, and recruiting candidates for guerrilla training and political
 indoctrination.  When such an agent has been recruited he is sent
 for his training to the Soviet Union, China, or Cuba, usually via a
 devious clandestine route.  A Peruvian traveling to the guerrilla war-
 fare schools in Cuba, for example, may fly, using his Peruvian passport,
 first to Paris, where his contacts from the Cuban intelligence service
 meet him and give him a Cuban passport with which to travel Paris-
 Prague-Havana.  The record in the bona fide Peruvian passport thus
 shows no travel to Communist countries.  After three to six months'
 training in Cuba he reverses these steps and returns to Peru as one

 of the hard-core cadres charged with preparing the insurgency.

 In this phase six aspects of the clandestine service mission can be
 specified:
 To find out what persons and procedures are used in selecting
 candidates for training and then to penetrate this spotting,
 assessment, and recruitment machinery in order to identify
 the cadres.  This effort will include penetration of the local
 Communist party.
 To identify and counter, using counterintelligence techniques,
 cadre-phase operations of the Soviet, Chinese, or Cuban intelli-
 gence residenturas.
 To expose publicly what the Communists are doing and how,
 and to show how the people of the country can contribute
 to resisting them.
 To seek by political-action measures to orient and motivate the
 host government to cooperate in clandestine operations against
 the cadre buildup and in preparations for combatting later
 phases of the insurgency.  This means that the government
 must have or develop an effective security agency with arrest
 powers and counterintelligence competence, sufficiently secure
 for liaison with the U.S. service.  Ideally this agency should
 maintain travel controls over all citizens going abroad.
 To conduct, if necessary, political-action programs to put teeth
 into the country's anti-subversive laws.  The government must
 be able to neutralize subversives not by sending them into
 exile but by putting them in jail.
 To help the country's military or police forces establish and train
 a crack guerrilla-killer unit to be deployed tactically in later
 phases.  The unit should not exceed battalion size, about 200
 men; its strength should lie in the quality of its personnel,
 their training and leadership, and in its mobility, fire power,
 communications, and tactics.
 Incipient Phase
 When the guerrilla trainee returns to his homeland he is usually
 tied into the local Communist party or the Soviet, Chinese, or Cuban
 intelligence residentura to get funds and guidance in developing the
 support structure for an active guerrilla campaign.  (Sometimes his
 support and guidance come from an adjacent country.)  In this incip-
 ient phase the returned agent begins his procurement of weapons,
 ammunition, and safehouses and settles on a rural area for his initial
 operations.  Within this area he picks a location for his base camp
 and begins to cultivate the sympathies of the peasantry around it
 within radius of a six-hour march.  Ile will need these peasants for
 logistical support and tactical intelligence.
 When the groundwork is completed, the agent moves in with five
 to ten companions.  After orienting itself in its surroundings, this
 incipient guerrilla band begins its political indoctrination of the peas-
 ants and the terrorizing with raids and burnings of all who remain
 hostile.  Gradually it gains new recruits, trains and equips them,
 and puts them into the field.  When it has grown to more than 20
 men and survived what initial measures the conventional military
 or police forces could take against it, it has matured as a guerrilla
 unit and completed the incipient phase.
 In this phase, the U.S. service, if feasible jointly with the govern-
 ment's security agency, should undertake the following kinds of
 operations:
 Identify the guerrilla agent as he returns from training or as
 soon thereafter as possible. Sources may be travel-control data
 or penetrations of the Communist party or recruitment ma-
 chinery.
 Identify rural and urban safehouses established in support of
 the guerrilla program.  This can be done through surveillance
 of the returning agent, through penetrations, or through inform-
 ant nets set up in likely rural areas (see below).
 Identify and block the guerrilla's channels for arms and ammu-
 nition procurement.  This can generally be done by the gov-
 ernment's customs and border patrol forces.  Intelligence pene-
 trations will help.
 Survey rural areas suitable for guerrilla bands and gather terrain
 intelligence, with emphasis on such things as water sources,
 potential ambush sites, and possible drop zones for the guerrilla-
 killer unit.  Bear in mind that the guerrilla usually cannot
 operate farther than a six hours' march from his base.
 Establish highly selective informant networks in potential guer-
 rilla areas as a source of tactical intelligence for the guerrilla-
 killer unit if guerrillas do begin operations there.  Such a net-
 work can be handled by the police units in the area in question,
 or some other apparatus can be set up for this essential job.
 Mount organized, professional civic-action programs to promote
 loyalty to the government among the populace of potential

 guerrilla areas. Convince the people that steps are being taken
 to right social, economic, and political wrongs.
 Begin guerrilla-killer operations as soon as intelligence indicates
 the presence of an incipient guerrilla band.  Tactics are sus-
 tained pursuit, ambushes, destruction of the base camp, denial
 of water and supplies, and finally direct confrontation in a
 fire fight.  Nothing is so effective in stopping the development
 of guerrilla bands as eliminating those who have just finished
 training and taken to the field for the first time.
 Operational Phase
 If the guerrilla movement is successful, in spite of all countermeas-
 ures taken during the cadre and incipient phases, in establishing
 several bands of twenty or more men each in some region, it has
 become a real threat to the country.  In this operational phase, the
 guerrillas try to consolidate their control of the region.  Though they
 keep the individual bands compartmented, they coordinate their
 activities so as to make the maximum political and tactical impact on
 the area.  They may thus drive the government forces out of the
 area completely; at least they break down the government's control
 over it: at night.  Area consolidation, in turn, enables the guerrilla to
 expand his supply mechanism, improve his collection of tactical intel-
 ligence, and obtain new recruits for his units.
 This, in essence, is the tactic Fidel Castro used so successfully when
 he went into the Sierra Macstra.  It is also what the FALN did in
 Falc6n state in Venezuela.  The longer the guerrillas can keep operat-
 ing in one area, the more likely they are to consolidate a political
 and operational base there and then break out to other areas.  When
 they get to the point that they can move with some freedom at
 battalion level in an area, the operational phase of insurgency gives
 way to one of covert warfare.
 During the operational phase, the U.S. clandestine service and the
 host government need to take the following actions:
 Intensify the effort to get intelligence on the guerrillas' strength,
 disposition, and plans.
 Step up counterintelligence operations against the guerrillas'
 logistic support apparatus.
 Mount psychological operations to keep the pro-government flame
 of resistance alive in guerrilla-controlled areas.  A portion of
 the psychological effort should also be targeted against the
 insurgents themselves, offering them rehabilitation if they sur-
 render.  (Those who do should be sent to training centers for
 vocational and political reorientation.)
 Intensify civic-action programs in the areas adjacent to those
 the guerrillas hold in order to prove to the populace in both
 that sustained cooperation with the government will produce
 a better and freer economic and social way of life than the
 guerrillas can offer.
 Step up the number and intensity of guerrilla-killer operations,
 using the killer unit at maximum capacity to eliminate guer-
 rilla bands in fire fights.  Give victories wide publicity in all
 media throughout the country.
 If the guerrillas are receiving logistical support from a contiguous
 country, and if their supply depots there can be identified,
 mount hit-and-run commando raids against them.  Whether
 the commandos are drawn from the military establishment of
 the country in question or brought in for the purpose from a
 third country, they should use bandit cover in order to provide
 for plausible denial.  Nevertheless the raids, in addition to
 their primary objective of destroying the depots, are intended
 to call attention to the supplying nation's interference in the
 affairs of its neighbor.
 Establish population controls, giving priority to districts adjacent
 to the guerrilla area. The key item in the control system is
 an identification document issued within a limited time to all
 residents of a given area.  This census certification, as it were,
 not only makes it more difficult for guerrillas to pass themselves
 off as innocent local farmers during the daytime but provides
 a point of departure for systematic counterintelligence opera-
 tions.
 Organize popular self-defense forces, or citizens' militia, in dis-
 tricts adjacent to the guerrilla areas.  Controlled by the con-
 ventional military establishment and properly motivated, these
 forces can contribute to containing the guerrillas through a
 strategic hamlet program, creating strong points for protection
 of the people and as bases for offensive operations.
 Bring the conventional military forces into full play in large
 sweep and encirclement operations mounted in coordination
 with the guerrilla-killer unit.  As the guerrillas are dispersed

 by the sweep and are beading for safe areas the guerrilla-
 killer force can both set up ambushes and engage in hot pur-
 suit.  With its superior training and equipment it should gen-
 erally outrun and outfight the scattering guerrilla.
 Covert Warfare Phase
 When the insurgents get to operating in battalion strength in two
 or more large regions and running raids and terror into other areas
 in preparation for expansion, when pitched fire fights are held between
 them and the government's conventional troops and the latter begin
 to suffer heavy losses, when a guerrilla-killer force of battalion size
 is no longer adequate, then covert war is in full swing, exceeding
 the scope of a civilian agency's paramilitary capability.  This means
 that the U.S. military establishment must begin to provide the gov-
 ernment forces with large amounts of equipment and send out advisers
 to work with them at company level.
 In this phase there is still, however, more than enough work for
 the U.S. civilian service to do:
 Provide airlift capacity, usually under commercial cover, to move
 government forces and supplies to combat areas or to bring
 in mercenaries as combat troops or as advisers.
 Furnish demolition technicians and other instructors for expanded
 training programs among the government forces.
 Continue and expand intelligence collection, counterintelligence
 operations, psychological programs to arouse a sense of national
 unity and purpose, civic-action enterprises, and "bandit" raids
 on adjacent-country supply depots.
 Conventional Warfare Phase
 When the enemy decides that his strength is sufficient to confront
 the government forces in decisive battle, as at Dien Bien Phu, and
 the United States decides to intervene in this overt conventional
 warfare, then the U.S. manpower needed can come only from the
 defense establishment. At this point the civilian intelligence agency's
 resources in the country are put at the disposal of the U.S. military
 commander.  At his direction they will carry out intelligence collec-
 tion, counterintelligence operations, and covert psychological and
 political programs.  Their paramilitary operations will be redirected
 to raids and harassments, the promotion of escape and evasion, and
 the development of resistance nuclei in the enemy's rear.
 Apologia
 Faced with almost any concrete situation, this general statement
 will be found at many points inapropos.  In some ways it is too
 incomplete, in others too inclusive.  It is not meant to imply, for
 example, that a U.S. clandestine service should direct overt propa-
 ganda or civic action campaigns if the appropriate U.S. agencies are
 there to do these things.  But in some times and places it must.
 The outline calls for some actions that have been tried in the past
 in concrete situations and have failed.  But it may be the situation,
 not the course of action, was wrong.     Or maybe the actions were
 carried out less than perfectly.
 The outline concentrates on the rural aspects of insurgency.  This
 does not mean that urban terrorism is of little importance.  But "wars
 of national liberation" must take and hold territory if they are to
 succeed, and there is established doctrine competent to deal with
 urban terrorism as an adjunct to insurgency.
 We hope, as we said, that our generalizations may be useful as a
 point of departure.  But if the essay even contributes to focusing
 thought on the problems that occasioned it, it will, despite acknowl-
 edged limitations, serve a purpose.

 National stereotypes and wishful
 thinking as they impinge on the
 intelligence officer's views.
 PEARL HARBOR: ESTIMATING THEN AND NOW
 A. R. Northridge
 On Sunday, 7 December 1941, submarines and aircraft from a Japa-
 nese fleet whose presence was totally unsuspected by our defense
 establishment attacked American military installations and naval ves-
 sels in the Hawaiian Islands.  Achieving complete surprise, the attack
 was a great success.  It crippled our retaliatory powers for more than
 a year, while the enemy escaped all but unscathed.
 The name Pearl Harbor has become a symbol of our disastrous
 failure to read rightly the many omens in the weeks preceding that
 pointed to war and even to this attack.  Reviewing the events and
 the climate of opinion of those times, it seems clear to me that we
 failed to foresee the Japanese assault largely because we were influ-
 enced by a faulty stereotype of what was an adversary nation.'  To-
 day, progress in the arts of weaponry and technical intelligence col-
 lection make unlikely another Pearl Harbor kind of surprise attack,
 but the faulty stereotype that can lead to grave miscalculation of an
 adversary's capability and intent remain with us, almost as a human
 condition.  This fact is one I believe every estimating intelligence
 officer should keep in the forefront of his consciousness.
 Among the more curious aspects of human relations is this stereo-
 type, or "image," that one people forms of another. The assortment
 of stereotypes it holds about others is an integral component of a
 people's social myth-the collection of beliefs, however derived, by
 'Of the extensive literature on Pearl Harbor, the most valuable single book
 is Pearl Harbor: Warning and Decision (Stanford, 1962), by Roberta Wohlstetter.
 In studying the circumstances of the intelligence failure she puts most emphasis
 on the fact that our intelligence community was confused by a multiplicity of
 irrelevant signals-noise that corrupted our data input.  Certainly this is a valid
 point, and in a sense my "stereotype" constitutes a particular kind of noise.  But
 my thesis is more closely related to the view, which Wohlstetter also treats, of
 Joseph C. Grew, Ambassador to Japan at the time, who said, "National sanity
 would dictate against such an event, but Japanese sanity cannot be measured by
 our own standards of logic."                      M  R~/Hpp pgRF

 which it orders its political life, including its relationships with other
 national states.  Some parts of a stereotype, though rarely the entire
 construct, are uniformly the same throughout the society holding it;
 some are different, even contradictory. Objectively, some parts of
 it are quite true, some partly true, and others totally untrue. The
 willful, wishful, or purposeful may hold some parts true even in the
 face of strong evidence to the contrary.
 These stereotypes constitute the intelligence officer's greatest peril,
 particularly in his estimative role, because he cannot escape their
 influence.  They form the greater part of his "input" on the problem
 at hand. Even though he may shut out invalid elements that he is
 aware of, as he reviews his materials he is bombarded by the stereo-
 type's other elements.  When he accepts a line of thought from an-
 other, say an expert in some field, he takes the risk that this opinion
 has been influenced by those very elements in the stereotype that
 he himself has rejected. He is thus inevitably and to some degree
 unwittingly more or less under the influence of ideas that he might
 consciously reject.
 The Japan Stereotype
 What sort of people did Americans, at the time of Pearl Harbor,
 believe the Japanese to be, and what did they believe about Japanese
 intentions toward themselves? The American view was ambiguous
 and shot through with inconsistencies.  At the extremes it ran contrary
 to observed data and to common sense, but its main lines might
 be summarized something like this: "The Japanese people, given the
 conflicts of interest between us, will quite likely-or maybe only
 possibly-do us a mischief if they can; but they lack the capacity to
 harm us seriously, and they know that this is so.  On the other hand,
 they are so cultivated and mannerly that it really is, after all, incon-
 ceivable that they would even try to harm us.".
 There was in the United States little doubt that Japan was an
 adversary and one of some consequence.  In seizing Manchuria and
 invading China, the Japanese had acted in defiance of the League
 of Nations.  Americans cherished peace, opposed aggression, and
 morally supported the League as "an instrument of peace."  They
 made clear their displeasure at Japan's aggressive acts.
 The Japanese could not be deterred without the use of force from
 their announced course of winning domination over eastern and south-
 eastern Asia. As they pressed on, American interests suffered.                Amer-
 ican markets were preempted and some of our sources of comm:nodi-
 ties became Japanese monopolies.  American treaty rights were
 abridged or ignored. Our Christian missions, not only evangelical but
 educational and medical missions as well, were hampered and their
 converts harassed.  Living conditions for Americans in Japanese-
 occupied Asia and throughout China became all but unbearable, and
 the American presence there was much reduced.
 These acts were, of course, greatly resented throughout the United
 States.  It was generally clear that the Japanese wanted to eliminate
 our power in eastern Asia.  Counteraction was often spoken of in
 the press, but the country as a whole was generally reluctant to resort
 to the use of armed force, the one thing that would inhibit our adver-
 sary. Why was this so?
 For one thing, the Japanese had their apologists.  While there was
 no denying that the general trend of their strategy was damaging our
 interests, it was argued by many Americans that all of this was after
 all going on in Asia.  What real business had the United States in
 eastern Asia, where its mere presence threatened to involve it in a
 conflict between two other powers?  The American in the Far East
 should come home.  If he chose to stay, he was not entitled to pro-
 tection.  These were the isolationists talking.
 The Wishers-Well
 Others dismissed as propaganda any reports of Japanese atrocities
 or interpretations picturing Japanese action inimical to our interests.
 These were partisans of the Japanese, sometimes so vigorous in their
 partisanship as to deny known facts.  I recall one instance when a
 China missionary, a clergyman of some distinction, told in calm and
 measured language how the Japanese had ravaged his parish and
 horribly abused his congregation.  Another missionary, this one from
 Japan, after hearing out his colleague, proclaimed his disbelief.  "I
 have worked with the Japanese for over thirty years," he said, "and
 I know that they simply would not act as you say they acted.    Some-
 how you have been deceived."
 If there was some wishfulness in this partisan thinking, there was
 more among the Far East experts in scholarly circles who believed
 that there was a "liberal" group in Japan that would somehow prevail
 over the fascistic militarists in power.  These experts had a wide
 hearing in this country, and their argument was particularly danger-
 ous.  The Japanese liberals, they said, being a minority group and

 very much at the mercy of the militarists, had to act discreetly, doing
 nothing to arouse the military clique against them. Americans who
 wished the liberals well had therefore to follow suit and avoid antago-
 nizing the militarists.  If they provoked them into retaliating against
 the liberals it would destroy the last hope of rescuing eastern Asia
 from military dictatorship.  This was an exceedingly comforting line
 of thought:  non-involvement, without sacrifice or risk, was the way
 to attain our aims.
 There was another argument that was often related to this.  The
 militarists, if we were only patient, would have to slow down. Japan
 had already swallowed more than she could digest; she could not
 administer or profit economically from more conquests.  She might
 even have to disgorge much that she had already seized. This argu-
 ment was heard when Japan moved into Manchuria; it was repeated
 when she occupied vast areas of China, including those most devel-
 oped economically; it was sounded again when her armies were
 poised to take southeast Asia.  Informed observers thus erected
 another hypothesis based on nothing more substantial than their
 predilections for a pleasant world that does not exist.
 The Charms of Art
 Another inconsistent facet of the stereotype was the warlike-peaceful
 quality of the Japanese.  One would have thought it well established
 long before Pearl Harbor that the Japanese had demonstrated a great
 aptitude for martial exercises and pursued them diligently, often with
 relish. It should also have been clear that they were indifferent to
 the sufferings inflicted on their foes, combatant and noncombatant
 alike.  That these were characteristic traits was clear enough to have
 been accepted automatically by all who heard the word Japanese.
 Yet their partisans managed to obscure this clarity, and here official
 organs of the Japanese government played a role.
 One device used in Japan's overt international program, one that
 was extremely effective in countering the growing evidence that they
 were a cruel and barbarous people, was a beautifully produced series
 of publications on various aspects of Japanese art and literature.
 These were widely distributed and in particular made available to
 public schools at little or no cost.  Of considerable artistic merit,
 they did much to foster a sentiment that people capable of producing
 such beauty could not have behaved so coarsely as they were being
 accused of acting.
 Another program in the cultural field was similarly successful.  For
 a number of years the quasi-governmental Japan Tourist Bureau
 had offered group tours to Japan, mainly on Japanese ships, at. ex-
 tremely low fares.  There were six ships plying this trade from the
 U.S. west coast, and through the summer months they carried a large
 volume of American tourists.  Few countries can show the foreign
 visitor a fairer face than Japan, and in those days probably none could
 give him more for his money.
 In the autumn of 1938 my wife and I were exposed for several
 weeks to a party returning from such a visit aboard a Japanese vessel
 bound for Seattle.  We were coming from a stay of several years in
 China, a year of it under Japanese military rule.  The Japanese had
 often inconvenienced but never maltreated us, and neither of us
 had ever witnessed a Japanese atrocity, other than the impersonal
 atrocity that is an inevitable part of war.  But by this time the
 infamous Rape of Nanking had taken place and the American river
 gunboat Panay had been sunk; and we were both deeply ashamed
 at the pusillanimity of our government's response to these actions.
 Indeed, we had taken passage on a Japanese ship only as a last resort.
 We found ourselves totally unable to communicate with our fellow
 passengers about the Japanese aggression in Asia.  All on board
 knew of Nanking and the Panay, but when we mentioned such things
 as these we found that the hospitality of the tour had operated to
 cancel any repugnance toward them.  Although we attempted no
 crusade, we were not popular.  It was as though we had mentioned
 before a gracious host and his guests some matter of no real concern
 to us which was vastly embarrassing to him.
 Thus at a time when the Japanese most needed it, literally -thou-
 sands of Americans were telling their friends and neighbors that
 first-hand observation had showed them a civilized, cultivated, honest,
 and gracious folk who displayed no sign of any bent for the horrible
 things being charged to them.  Weren't we perhaps being misin-
 formed, even by well-meaning people like our missionary clergy in
 China?
 Incompetent Nippon
 Aside from this ambiguity in the American view of Japan's martial
 proclivities in general, there was disagreement on the specific question
 whether Japan might attack the United States; and here the con-
 sensus was largely negative.  It was thought that Japan would not

 make war on us because of her limited military capability; she could
 never hope to succeed. There was some evidence, however, that bore
 on this point, and it was mainly to the contrary.
 The Sino-Japanese war was not conducted in private. Official quali-
 fied observers from many nations were on hand, and their opportuni-
 ties for observation varied from good to excellent.  Large military
 actions took place in the environs of cities where extraterritorial privi-
 leges protected the foreigner.  The hinterland was dotted with mis-
 sionaries and, to a lesser extent, businessmen who could and did report
 to the service attache what they had seen.
 Generally speaking, the Japanese armies showed their competence
 wherever their performance was observable.  While their Chinese
 opposition was inferior to most Western armies and not well sup-
 plied, some Chinese formations as large as army groups fought credit-
 ably, providing a fair test.  Although there were some instances of
 faulty Japanese generalship, foreign attaches were greatly impressed
 by Japanese skill in retrieving victory from near-disaster in the cam-
 paigns around Shanghai.        They were impressed by the Japanese
 ability to move large bodies of troops over difficult terrain where
 transportation facilities were primitive at best.  They were struck
 by the power of the Japanese Army Air Force and by what little
 they saw of Japan's naval air arm.  The morale, physical endurance,
 and the courage and state of training of the individual Japanese
 infantryman were noted and often admired.  Japanese weapons were
 seen to be serviceable, if lacking the polish of comparable pieces
 used in Western armies. Japanese artillery was observed to be accu-
 rate in aim and surprisingly heavy in its destructive power.
 The Japanese navy remained something of an enigma.  It was
 involved in no fleet actions.  It was observed only in convoy work,
 in the bombardment of shore targets, and, more rarely, in exercises
 by larger groups of ships.  It was known, however, that the Japanese
 were a maritime people whose merchant shipping could be seen
 throughout the Seven Seas.  They built and operated their own mer-
 chant marine, and in this activity they were a match for any country.
 Against the evidence of this performance, together with the little that
 could be discovered about their fighting ships, it would not be prudent
 to count their navy less capable than their ground and air forces.
 Thus what the professional and other observers saw of the Japanese
 military, and presumably reported to the appropriate offices, did not
 square with the prevailing stereotype.  Here the gap between image
 and reality was enormous.  Three separate facets of the former come
 to mind.  One was the often repeated statement that the Japanese
 people lacked inventive powers. They could imitate but not innovate.
 Their arms were no more than copies of Western models.  An often
 told, widely believed tale had it that the latest Japanese capital
 ships were built from plans stolen from British naval shipbuilders,
 but British intelligence had learned of the theft plot in advance and
 substituted faulty blueprints.  The Japanese followed these meticu-
 lously, so when the new ships were launched they turned turtle and
 sank, just as MI-6 had planned.
 Another widespread belief was that Japan's industry could not -urn
 out a durable product.  It did turn out shoddy ones wherever the
 world market would absorb them, and these were cited, despite plainly
 visible evidence to the contrary, as showing the best it could do.
 It was, for example, the cheap Made-in-Japan light bulb which burned
 out after a few hours that found a place in the stereotype, not the
 magnificent hydroelectric systems which Japanese talent designed and
 built for the home islands, Korea, and Formosa.
 The third fable entering the stereotype was that the anatomy of
 the Japanese was deficient.  He was not physically able to use the
 weapons of modern war, particularly aircraft.  His vision was so poor
 that he could not see to fly or bomb.  His nervous reactions were
 faulty, limiting him to the most elementary aerobatics.  Airborne; he
 was bound to be a total failure.  On the day of Pearl Flarbor we
 were often offered this comforting thought by the radio announcers
 who told us over and over again that this was going to be a short
 and easy war.
 On the evening of 5 December, an American university professor
 making a public address asserted, in response to questions, that he
 believed Japan would attack the United States, probably that week-
 end, and that the attack would almost certainly include a diversionary
 naval raid against Hawaii to deter us from reinforcing the Philip-
 pines, where the main weight of the assault would fall.  The speaker
 had no formal military training nor access to classified information.
 He had lived in eastern Asia and had seen the Japanese army in
 action.  He drew these conclusions from what he saw in the daily
 press, relating it to his current courses on the politics of the Pacific.

 But on that same weekend a number of well-known figures in
 private and official life-both civil and military, area experts, journal-
 ists, businessmen, diplomats, and so on-were holding a colloquium
 sponsored by one of the leading journals of a midwestern city.  The
 announced subject was "Peace in the Pacific," and there was general
 agreement among the speakers that for the United States there was
 little or no likelihood of military involvement in the Pacific.
 A military intelligence appreciation of about the same time prog-
 nosticated concerning what would transpire in the event of Japanese-
 American hostilities.  The omens, as the oracle read them, pointed
 to gigantic fleet actions here or there in the Pacific.  There was a
 reference to the possibility of Japanese cruisers raiding our merchant
 shipping in the Gulf of Panama.  There was none to the possibility
 of Japanese surface ships approaching the Hawaiian Islands.
 What chance was there that the professional intelligence officer
 assigned to estimative duties could predict the Japanese assault on
 Hawaii, hampered as he was by the weight of public opinion and
 "expert" opinion voiced loudly in public?  As I see it, only a little
 chance.  The stereotype overcame him in the end.  Since that time
 the practice of intelligence in the United States has improved greatly,
 but the opportunities for self-deception are at least as great as ever.
 Machinery has been built up where there was almost none before.
 Its effectiveness, however, still depends on the human element.  No
 one has yet found a cure for our tendency to believe what we find
 most congenial and reject what seems repugnant.
 New Stereotypes
 In today's world, the catastrophic consequences of unbridled war
 make it unlikely that one great power will launch a massive surprise
 assault on another.  The condition that gave rise to Pearl Harbor,
 however, remains unchanged or, if anything, exacerbated.  This is
 the system of national states, under which the globe is partitioned
 among sovereign political entities, each dedicated to the principle of
 self-interest, seeking to expand its power at the expense of others
 and willing to resort to force to protect its position, prospects, or
 prestige.  The struggle among these rival entities is carried on by
 means short of all-out war, and the political clash has become a more
 intricate and sophisticated battle than ever before.  The main battle-
 field is now the new, needy, underdeveloped nations.
 In the postwar struggle for power the Communists are the ag-
 gressors.  They make no secret of their intent to number the new
 nations, along with the rest of the world, among their adherents.
 Their campaign employs every weapon in the arsenal of politics,
 including force or threat of force when they assess as small the risk
 of escalation into a conflict where the new weapon will be used.
 This renunciation of the ultimate force for political purposes is an
 historical novelty, a kind of warfare to which we are only gradually
 becoming accustomed.  Some Communist tactics and elements of
 strategy we have probably not yet discerned, at least not clearly
 enough to devise countermeasures, and for others we have found no
 adequate defense.
 One of their current successes reminiscent of Japanese strategy in
 the years before Pearl Harbor is the promotion of their own stereotype
 of the newly emerged nations.  In part it is the familiar aesopian
 language of Communist discourse, the use of nomenclature that
 reverses accepted definitions and the persistent perversion of truth
 in the face of objective evidence.  With this particular perversion
 their success has been phenomenal.  The stereotype pictures a land
 that has been thoroughly victimized by a ruthless imperial power
 whose only motive in its relations with the colony was greed for gain.
 And this picture is imposed regardless of whether the colonial. rela-
 tionship ever really existed in fact.                                                                                                             The "colony" may be a sovereign
 state, and the "imperialist power" need not hold or even desire
 hegemony over it.
 Further, the Communist stereotype justifies behavior on the part
 of the so-called colony, or Communist-affiliated political elements
 within it, that they would call intolerable in an "imperialist" power or
 in a political party independent of their control.  Any politically
 organized fragment affiliated with the Communists is hailed as a
 force for "national liberation," while its native political opponents
 are no better than the foreign colonizers, creatures of the imperialists
 dedicated to the suppression of freedom.  The Communist bloc has as
 its historic mission and trust the support of wars and other efforts
 of liberation.
 It is true that this stereotype is not wholly accepted in the non-
 Communist world, particularly the Communists' nobility in promot-
 ing wars of national liberation, but much of it is evident in the more
 "liberal" writings on underdeveloped countries.  English and Ameri-
 can writers about these countries have tended automatically to ex-

 plain their great tribulations in independence as simply the result
 of their colonial experience.  This attribution, often of dubious
 validity, leads them to refuse any credit-if they do not explicitly
 deny it, they omit to mention it-to colonial powers for actions bene-
 ficial to colonial populations.              And their acceptance of this part of
 the Communist stereotype tends to lend credence to the rest.
 In other matters one can see terminology creeping into our studies,
 or being excluded from them, in a way that suggests we are being
 influenced to think in concepts the Communists would like us to use.
 Our own writers, non-Communists, criticize a monarchial government
 as inappropriate to the times and cite its neighbor, a "people's
 democracy" that is in fact a repressive autocracy, as one the United
 States should cultivate.  We use the word "capitalist" only as a
 technical term in economics, not to describe ourselves: the pejorative
 flavor imparted to it by the Communists has taken hold.  Similarly,
 the Communists have given the word "bloc" an unpleasant connota-
 tion in its meaning of a political combination against a common
 adversary.  Thus the term "capitalist bloc," the consolidation of
 which is certainly an American policy objective, we seldom use except
 in quoting a Communist document.  These two examples of Com-
 munist tactical victories in our home field may not bring any tangible
 gain to the adversary, but they do tend to confuse and obfuscate the
 analyst, whether man in the street or intelligence officer.
 As we pointed out, the intelligence officer now operates in a world
 of interstate relations immensely more complicated than anything
 he has known before.  His guideposts are few and often misleading,
 and his experience tables are of little use to him.  At the same time,
 his mistakes have a potential for damage undreamed of hitherto
 by man.

 INTELLIGENCE IN RECENT PUBLIC LITERATURE
 New Light on Old Spies
 A Review of Recent Soviet Intelligence Revelations
 Espionage is needed by those who prepare for attack, for
 aggression.  The Soviet Union is deeply dedicated to the
 cause of peace and does not intend to attack anyone.  There-
 fore it has no intention of engaging in espionage: -Ni:kita
 Khrushchev to Saneo Nozaka, Chairman of the Japanese
 Communist Party, 1962.
 Until recently the average Soviet citizen, had he been asked, would
 have denied that his Government engaged in espionage against other
 states.  Such a dirty practice, he could have added if he faithfully
 followed the official propaganda line, was employed only by the
 imperialists, with the USSR as their target.  Had not the Soviet
 Union been compelled to create and maintain a state security service
 to protect itself from just such imperialist machinations?
 The average Soviet, if he was ever so naive, is now disabused of his
 illusions.  His government has reversed a policy in force since Lenin's
 day to admit that it has been practicing espionage abroad all the
 time.  For reasons not yet clear, it has created a new hero: the
 intrepid intelligence agent spying abroad in peacetime for the Soviet
 fatherland at great personal sacrifice and danger.
 By this action the Soviet regime has in effect surfaced the military
 intelligence service (GRU) to its own citizens.  The hero intelligence
 operative has joined the hero Chekist in the Soviet pantheon.  More-
 over, the hero Chekist, hitherto portrayed as the valiant defender of
 the regime against foreign and domestic enemies, has now become
 an aggressive collector of intelligence abroad.  For the first time
 since the Revolution the espionage exploits of the Soviet military in-
 telligence service and state security have been officially acknowledged.
 True, the official accounts of these exploits must seem inadequate to
 any Soviet mind bold enough to reflect on the matter, but their
 quality is not the point at issue.  The crucially significant fact is that
 Soviet espionage activities were surfaced at all.  An official policy

 dating back to the Revolution has been dramatically and unaccountably
 revised.
 Richard Sorge
 When surfacing the GRU, the Soviet authorities chose to highlight
 Richard Sorge, the German citizen whose exploits for Soviet military
 intelligence in China and Japan before the second world war, although
 never revealed in the Soviet Union, have been known in the West
 for almost two decades.  Sorge's career in espionage, and especially
 his penetration of the Japanese government and the German embassy
 in Tokyo, had been earlier examined in detail by General Charles
 Willoughby, Hans Otto Meissner, and Chalmers Johnson.'  Their
 works, although differing in detail and interpretation of events, are
 largely based on reports of the Japanese investigation of the Sorge
 network and certain memoirs and secondary publications.  All are
 inaccurate in varying degrees.  The Japanese investigation, the prin-
 cipal non-Communist source on the case, was inadequately handled
 and left :many unanswered questions but did supply the broad outlines
 of the affair.  David Dallin, it should be noted, has barely mentioned
 the case.2  As of 1965, little had been added to our knowledge of
 the operation.
 Richard Sorge has been surfaced in the Soviet Union by means of
 a series of newspaper articles and popular books.  His glorification
 was begun in late 1964 with an article by Viktor Mayevskiy in
 Pravda.s    Written after a visit to Sorge's grave in Tokyo, this article
 is an unrelieved panegyric on its subject.  Other articles on Sorge
 in the Soviet central and provincial press quickly followed.  Ya. Gorev,
 who is said to have served in the GRU with Sorge in Berlin, pre-
 'Major General Charles Willoughby, Shanghai Conspiracy, The Sorge Spy
 Ring (New York, 1952); Chalmers Johnson, An Instance of Treason (Stanford,
 California, 1964); Hans Otto Meissner, The Man With Three Faces (New York,
 1955).  A German edition of Meissner's book, the title of which indicates its
 partially fictional character (Der Fall Sorge: Roman Nach Tatsachen) was pub-
 lished in Munich during the same year.  Several short accounts of the Sorge case
 have appeared in espionage anthologies.  Branko Vukelic, a member of Sorge's
 network in Japan, has been the subject of Yugoslav newspaper articles.  See
 Dushan Cvetic, "Ko Je Branko Vukelich?" in Politika Ekspres, 4-20 November 1963.
 'David J. Dallin, Soviet Espionage (New Haven, 1955).
 ' Viktor Mayevskiy, "Tovarishch Zorge" (Comrade Sorge) in Pravda, 4 Sep-
 tember 1964.
 sented what seems to be an official account of Sorge's career.4
 Gorev claims to have helped prepare Sorge for his Far East assign-
 ment and to have operated near him there.  His use of Sorge's letters
 and messages indicates that he had access to official files, but he has
 furnished little new data on the case. Sorge is presented as a
 paragon of virtue; his weakness for alcohol and women is ignored.
 Gorev's version of the Sorge operation generally corresponds to that
 presented by Meissner and Willoughby.  In all probability he drew
 heavily on these sources.
 Although Moscow has for some reason suppressed Gorev's account,
 the glorification campaign has continued unabated since late 1964.
 Persons who knew Sorge even slightly have given interviews for
 publication.  On occasion, these individuals have admitted they
 did not know Sorge was engaged in intelligence work.  Gerhardt
 Eisler has contributed a short memoir.5  V. Kudryavtsev, a Tass
 correspondent in Tokyo during 1931-1937, told of meeting Sorge and
 Branko Vukelic in Japan.6  He had no knowledge of their intelligence
 work at the time.  Gerhard Stuchlik and Horst Pehnert, East. German
 journalists, wrote a series of articles drawing on those by Mayevskiy
 and Gorev, interviews with Max Klausen, Sorge's radio operator, and
 with Gerhardt Eisler, and such Western sources as Meissner and
 Willoughby.?  Except for certain details on Sorge's early life, these add
 relatively little.
 Several people living outside the Soviet Union have recently con-
 tributed reminiscences of Sorge.  Kai Moltke and Richard Jensen,
 former Communists, have written of Sorge's stay in Denmark during
 in Iunge
 a , 15 Oct. 1964 to 2-3 Jan. 1965.
 ` Ya. Gorev, "Ya Znal Zorge" (I Knew Sorge) in Komsomolska ya Pravda, 8
 October 1964-1 November 1964.  The Gorev articles were issued as a pamphlet
 under the same title in an edition of 240,000 copies (Moscow, 1964), but this
 publication was withdrawn from sale shortly after it appeared and has not been
 reissued up to this time.  Gorev may be identical with Petr Aleksandrovich
 Skoblevskiy, a Soviet citizen who was arrested in Germany in 1923 and was
 tried in Leipzig two years later on charges of attempting the overthrow of the
 Weimar Republic.  Skoblevskiy was later exchanged for Karl Kinderrnann and
 Theodor Wolscht, two German citizens who had been arrested in the USSR.

 1928.8  Sorge's wife Christine has published a short and uninforma-
 tive memoir in a Swiss periodical."  None of these accounts makes
 any significant contribution to an understanding of the Sorge operation.
 A popular, semi-fictional version of Sorge's career was carried by
 the Soviet periodical Ogonek, beginning on 28 February 1965.  Its
 authors, Sergey Golyakov and Vladimir Ponosovskiy, fail to throw
 new light on the case.  They present Sorge as declaring himself a
 Soviet citizen to his Japanese jailers.  A sizable paperback edition of
 this series (300,000 copies) was published early in 1965.10
 It is clear that the Soviet authorities wish to present Sorge as a
 popular hero but have no desire at this time to publish an accurate
 history of his intelligence operation.   By decree of the Presidium
 of the Supreme Soviet, on 5 November 1964 he was posthumously
 awarded the title, Hero of the Soviet Union.  In January 1965, Max
 Klausen was awarded the Order of the Red Banner and his wife
 Anna received the Order of the Red Star.  Branko Vukelic was
 posthumously awarded the Order of the Patriotic War (First Degree).
 The East German Government has conferred on Max and Anna
 Klausen the Gold Medal of Merit of the National People's Army.
 But perhaps the most significant honor bestowed on Sorge was the
 issuance, early in 1965, of a Soviet stamp bearing his portrait.  He
 thus joins Nathan Hale as an intelligence agent who has been paid
 philatelic honors by his government.  No further proof is required
 of the intention of the Soviet authorities to add Sorge to the Soviet
 pantheon.11
 Other GRU Cases
 Soviet authorities have also seen fit to give publicity to an obscure
 officer of the GRU surfaced under the name of Colonel Lev Yefimovich
 Manevich.  This man was made posthumously a Hero of the Soviet

 Union in early 1965,12 presumably for wartime services.  He is
 credited in the Soviet press with service in an unidentified foreign
 country, possibly Germany or German-occupied Europe. According
 to the Soviet accounts he was betrayed through the cowardice of an
 assistant and imprisoned in German concentration camps, where he
 was known under the name Ya. N. Starostin.  Before his death from
 tuberculosis at the Ebensee camp in Austria on 12 May 1945, he is
 said to have confided to a fellow inmate, one Grant Gregoryevich
 Ayrapetov, that his cryptonym was Etienne and to have asked that
 the Soviet authorities be notified.
 Manevich is portrayed as a devoted intelligence agent who continued
 his work despite serious illness.  According to Ayrapetov, Marevich
 compiled files on Soviets in Vlassov's unit, on followers of bandera,
 the Ukrainian nationalist leader, and on other collaborators, all of
 which he turned over to one F. N. Dontsov for transmittal to the
 Soviet authorities.  Interviews with Manevich's sister and Ayrapetov
 have appeared in the Soviet provincial press.13  The reason for sur-
 facing Manevich in particular is unclear, unless the script called for
 an intelligence agent whose activities could be related to the second
 world war.  This criterion could also be applied to Sorge.
 One former chief of Soviet military intelligence, a victim of the
 great purge, has recently been rehabilitated, apparently as ;part of
 this publicity campaign.  Yu. Geller has written a brief account of
 the career of Semen Petrovich Uritskiy, chief of the GRU between
 1935 and 1937 until he was purged and executed by Stalin.  Only
 the most general information on Uritskiy's career is given.  His in-
 telligence work is passed over with the excuse that it cannot yet be
 made public, but he is credited with having directed officers of the
 caliber of Sorge and Manevich.14

 guise of a German resistance movement. Through the device of an
 interview with Greta (Margareta) Kuckhoff, a member of the group
 and presently a banking official in East Germany, the Soviet authorities
 have lifted a corner of the veil that still covers their wartime mili-
 tary intelligence operations in Europe.13       Rote Kapelle (the Nazi
 origin of this name is admitted by the Soviets) is portrayed as an
 antifascist group that began to take shape before the Hitler dictator-
 ship was established.  Although the upper-class origin of its leaders,
 Arvid Harnack and Harro Schulze-Boysen, and of other members is
 admitted, a determined effort is made to show that it also contained
 many persons of working-class origin.  The espionage role of the
 group is presented in rather incidental fashion, without emphasis.
 No mention is made of the GRU networks that existed in France,
 Belgium, Holland and Switzerland.  Greta Kuckhoff presents East
 Germany as the heir to the cause for which the Rote Kapelle fought.
 State Security: Abel
 The admission to the Soviet people that the state security service,
 long portrayed as a defensive, counterintelligence arm of the state,
 does in fact engage in peacetime espionage abroad is equally dramatic.
 By virtue of its internal, repressive activity, the security service is
 only too well known to the Soviet population.  Few Soviet citizens
 can have avoided some brush with the heavy hand of the security
 component, but equally few of them have known until recently what
 every literate Westerner has long known, that the state security service
 is also a principal arm of Soviet espionage abroad.  In keeping with
 the dogma that only aggressive imperialist states engage in espionage,
 the existence of the First Chief Directorate of the security service, the
 foreign arm, was never admitted.  The surfacing of its espionage in
 foreign countries, therefore, represents a major shift in Soviet intelli-
 gence policy.
 This policy shift was signaled by an article on the career of Col.
 Rudolf Abel that appeared in Nedelya (The Week) during May 1965.16
 is L. Bezymensky, "Po Tu Storonu Fronta.  Rasskaz Grety Kukkhof o Podpolnoi
 Antifashistskoi Organizatsii, Deystvovavskey v Gitlerovskoy Germanii" (On That
 Side of the Front.  An Account of Greta Kuckhoff Concerning the Underground
 Anti-Fascist Organization That Was Active in Hitlerite Germany), in Novoye
 Vremya, 9 May 1965, pp. 28-31.  This interview also appeared in the English-
 language edition of this periodical of the same date.
 1e Major-General V. Drozdov, "Tovarishch Abel-Soldat Nevidimogo Fronta"
 (Comrade Abel-Soldier of the Invisible Front) in Nedelya, 2-8 May 1965, pp.
 6-7.  Nedelya is the Sunday supplement of the newspaper Izvestiya.
 According to its author, Abel was born in a city near the Volga, en-
 tered the state security service about 1927, and worked before and
 during World War II as an intelligence agent against Germany, being
 covered as a member of the German minority in Latvia.  It is sig-
 nificant that Abel's espionage activity after the war is shown as :moti-
 vated by a personal desire to neutralize the activity of "fascist crimi-
 nals" who had taken refuge in the West.  The theme of working
 against Nazi criminals presumably would be popular with the Soviet
 people and fits the time-honored portrayal of state security as a de-
 fensive organization.
 Colonel Abel is also the hero of a novel by Vadim Kozhevnikov now
 being serialized in Znamya, the organ of the Union of Writers.17
 Kozhevnikov's novel has not yet appeared in book form in the USSR.
 It is also being serialized in the Yugoslav newspaper Borba.
 According to the author, Abel's true name is Aleksandr Ivanovich
 Belov.  Since the work is frankly fiction, however, none of the data
 it contains can be accepted without verification.  The significant fact
 is that the Soviet government has thus belatedly chosen to portray
 Abel as a hero Chekist employed in espionage abroad.
 The theme of work against postwar Nazis, it is interesting to note,
 also appears in the purported memoirs of Gordon Lonsdale (Conon
 Molody), the state security officer who was convicted of espionage in
 the United Kingdom and later exchanged for Greville Wynne, a
 British subject involved in the Penkovskiy trial.  Lonsdale claims
 that he wished to operate against former Nazis who were employed
 in the United Kingdom.  The Lonsdale "memoirs," which have been
 serialized in the British press 1s  but not published in the USSR are
 clearly designed as a deception operation.  Their accounts of his
 Canadian birth, a childhood spent in Poland, and intelligence work
 with Colonel Abel in the United States before going to the United
 Kingdom are, from evidence on hand, complete fabrications.  They
 are designed to confuse Western intelligence services, sow dissension
 between the British and American governments, and denigrate both
 British security and British justice.  Any truth they may contain is
 merely incidental to these purposes.

 Dzerzhinskiy
 For several decades the Soviet regime has endeavored to justify
 the counterintelligence activity of its security service, calling it the
 "punishing sword of the Revolution," the defender of the Soviet nation
 and state against foreign and domestic enemies. Its intimate relation-
 ship to the party leadership was deliberately blurred; its full role
 in intra-party struggles for power has been concealed.
 The participation of the security service in these struggles and
 the purges they brought forth, events that are well remembered by
 the Soviet people, made difficult the task of investing it with any
 sort of glamour.  In practice it was necessary to concentrate on
 the earliest period of its history, the period of revolution, civil war,
 and early post-revolutionary years, when it was headed by Feliks
 Edmundovich Dzerzhinskiy, the Polish revolutionary idealist, friend
 and associate of Lenin, who died before Stalin began his purges.
 The Dzerzhinskiy period of the service is portrayed as a time of high
 idealism, a golden age.
 The exigencies of Soviet internal politics have made it impossible
 to glorify Dzerzhinskiy's successors, who were either nonentities
 (Menzhinskiy ), more tools of Stalin (Yagoda, Yezhev) or latter-day
 villains in their own right (Beriya).  Soviet party leaders will do
 nothing that might undermine the effectiveness of the security service
 as the defender of the regime, hence the history of the service under
 Stalin's dictatorship is not likely to be revealed.  Their efforts to
 refurbish its image will never be allowed to endanger its internal
 efficiency.  It is unlikely, therefore, that any detailed history of state
 security will appear in the foreseeable future.
 Historical material on the service nevertheless continues to appear.
 As noted above, much attention is given to the life and personality
 of Dzerzhinskiy, so much in fact that something of a cult of per-
 sonality seems to have grown up around him.'   In 1956, selections of
 his diary and family letters, all pre-revolutionary in date, made their
 appearance.20  P. G. Sofinov published during the same year a popular

 biography of Dzerzhinskiy that made use of certain hitherto un-
 published archival material.21  In the following year, a selection of
 Dzerzhinskiy's writings that emphasized his work in other components
 of the Soviet government such as the Commissariat of the Interior,
 Commissariat of Transportation, and Supreme Council of the National
 Economy made its appearance.22  A more rounded view of his career
 is thus now available.23
 During recent years Soviet authors have continued to mine the
 ore of Dzerzhinskiy's life and career.  A. Khatskevich published, a
 careful biographical study of him in which he uses his subject's pre-
 revolutionary documentary files.24                                                                                                                     On the other hand, N. Zubov has
 produced another popular biography repeating well-worn facts and
 stories .25'  Dzerzhinskiy's eighty-fifth birthday was commemorated by
 the appearance of a rather barren volume of reminiscences that adds
 little or nothing to our knowledge of the man.26
 Perhaps the most interesting volume on Dzerzhinskiy to appear in
 recent years is Mme. Dzerzhinskiy's memoirs, published in 1964.  She
 gives the texts of letters never before published or previously pub-
 lished only in part.  She also provides an interpretation of her
 husband's background and development based on an association of
 many years that should contribute significantly to an understanding
 of the man.27  It will be interesting to see whether Soviet historians

 produce additional significant material on Dzerzhinskiy's career as
 chief of state security.  If, as one authority contends, the Cheka
 archives were destroyed, that task may be diffrcult.211
 Other Chekists
 Few other officials of state security have been honored with biog-
 raphies.  I. V. Viktorov's rather sparse and matter-of-fact biography
 of Mikhail Sergeyevich Kedrov, an old Bolshevik and associate of
 Dzerzhinskiy, is unusual in that it covers in part the period of the
 great purges.  According to Viktorov, Kedrov's son Igor and a friend,
 one Volodya Golubev, both employed by state security, discovered
 in early 1939 that Beriya and his associates were betraying the USSR
 in the interest of Hitler.  The two young Chekists, after consulting
 the elder Kedrov, who by then was out of the service, decided to
 make the facts known to Stalin and the Party Control Commission.
 When the young men were arrested, as they anticipated being, M S.
 Kedrov was to approach Stalin, reveal the facts of the matter, and
 call Stalin's attention to a letter accusing Beriya that he (Kedrov)
 had written to Dzerzhinskiy in 1921.
 But Igor Kedrov and Golubev were arrested in late February 1939
 and shot.  The elder Kedrov was arrested several months later.
 Despite the fact that he succeeded in proving his innocence, he was
 not freed, and in late 1941 Beriya disposed of him also.  This story,
 which also serves to denigrate Stalin, is reported without details or
 substantiating facts.  Viktorov's book perhaps serves to rehabilitate
 M. S. Kedrov, but it adds little or nothing to our knowledge of the
 state security service.29
 An Estonian official of the Cheka, Viktor E. Kingisepp, has also been
 honored with a biography.30  Kingisepp took a prominent part in
 the investigation of the attempt on Lenin's life in August 1918.
 Memoirs of old Chekists are rare in Soviet literature.  The memoirs
 of F. T. Fomin, a retired member of state security, were published
 " Slusser, op. cit., quotes Boris Nikolayevskiy, the Menshevik historian, as
 citing an unidentified emigre source to the effect that the Cheka archives had
 been destroyed in order to prevent historians in future from studying the Cheka
 terror and Lenin's part in directing it.

 in 1962 in an original edition of 350,000 copies, certainly a very large
 printing for a book of this type.  A second, revised edition appeared
 in 1964.31  Fomin, it is interesting to note, admits that Chekists could
 misuse their authority for personal goals, citing the activities of a
 Baltic baron in the Ukrainian Cheka to prove the point.  Perhaps
 it is significant that the miscreant was of noble birth.  It is also note-
 worthy that Fomin presents a highly favorable picture of V. R. Men-
 zhinskiy, Dzerzhinskiy's successor as chief of state security, a weak
 man whose tour at the head of the service is considered an inter-
 regnum between Dzerzhinskiy and G. G. Yagoda.  Fomin, however,
 does not mention the much more significant Yagoda, whose role in
 state security until he was purged by Stalin was considerable.
 Operations
 Histories of the state security service and its operations have been
 even more rare.  When they do appear, such volumes cover the
 early period of the service, the time of the Cheka.  The most sig-
 nificant historical study of the Cheka to appear in recent: years is
 P. G. Sofinov's volume, Historical Sketches, published in 1960.32
 The Soviets have also seen fit to surface in part the highly successful
 TRUST operation of the mid-twenties.  This counterintelligence opera-
 tion, which was mounted by state security, was designed to neutralize
 the anti-regime activities of Russian emigres and the intelligence
 operations of European services.  Using as decoy a national organi-
 zation, the "Monarchical Organization of Central Russia," usually
 called TRUST, Soviet state security was able to deflect and control the
 attempts of its enemies to overthrow the Soviet regime during the
 time of its greatest weakness.    A new and untested service thus
 succeeded in misleading the most experienced intelligence services
 of Western Europe and in almost completely neutralizing the dedi-
 cated work of its emigre opponents.
 Not the least of its achievements was the enticement into the Soviet
 Union and seizure in 1925 of Sidney George Reilly, an able British
 intelligence officer who had operated in Russia with Robert Bruce-
 Lockhart in 1918.  Lev Nikulin has described the enticement and

 seizure of Reilly in an article in Nedelya.33 Not unnaturally, Nikulin
 shows great pride in this achievement of the security service and its
 young officers.  He undertakes to smear the image of Reilly, how-
 ever, quoting what purports to be Reilly's offer to Dzerzhinskiy to.
 give full information on the organization and staff of the British
 intelligence service, members of the Russian emigration with whom
 he had worked, and-significantly-the American intelligence service.
 Since U.S. intelligence was moribund by the middle twenties, any
 information thereon supplied by Reilly, if indeed he wrote such a
 letter to Dzerzhinskiy, would have been historical.
 Nikulin's article was described as a chapter from his forthcoming
 "novel-chronicle" on TRUST.  This book, Mertvaya Zyb (The Swell)
 apparently has not been published up to this time.14
 Soviet Motives
 As is often true of Russian policy, the objectives to be served by
 the surfacing of Soviet espionage activities abroad are not immediately
 evident.  The reasons for the adoption of such a policy are difficult
 to disentangle.  Perhaps the interplay of personal ambitions and
 jealousies among Party and government leaders has played its part.
 Although no evidence on the point is available, this unusual Soviet
 frankness may reflect the growing influence of Alexander Shelepin,
 former chief of the KGB who has played an increasingly prominent
 role in Soviet affairs since the overthrow of Khrushchev.  It may be
 assumed, in any case, that the decision to admit to the Soviet people
 that their government also engages in actions hitherto credited only
 to bourgeois and fascist states was not lightly reached on the spur
 of the moment.  Undoubtedly it was made at the highest Party levels,
 after lengthy and possibly acrimonious discussion.  Party leaders must
 have agreed that the advantages of such a revelation outweighed any
 ill effect on the Soviet population.
 "Lev Nikulin, "Konets Sidneya Dzhordzha Reili" (The End of Sidney George
 Reilly) in Nedelya, 2-8 August,  1964.  Another article by Nikulin, "Istoriya
 Odnogo Voyazha" (The Story of a Voyage) appeared in Nedelya, 11-17 October
 1964, pp. 10-11.  This article, presumably another chapter in Nikulin's book on
 TRUST, describes the clandestine visit to the USSR made by Vasiliy V. Shulgin in
 1925-1926 under the auspices Of TRUST, that is, under state security control.  On
 his return to Western Europe, Shulgin described this visit in his book, Tri Stolitsy
 (Three Capitals).
 "An uneven and not completely satisfactory account of the TRUST operation,
 largely drawn from Western sources, is contained in Geoffrey Bailey (pseud.),
 The Conspirators, New York, 1960.
 What are the possible advantages of the revelation?
 Such foreign espionage operations as have been surfaced up to
 this time are related to the Germany of Hitler and the second world
 war.  The work of Manevich, if that was in fact his name, is pre-
 sented as having been done in Eastern Europe, probably in Germany
 or a German-occupied area, and in a Nazi concentration camp.  A
 series of paperbacks on the frontier guards and wartime partisan
 operations continue the anti-Nazi defense theme.3'  Abel, it is said,
 worked against the Germans; his postwar activities were motivated
 by a desire to get at former Nazis who were active in the West.
 Lonsdale is made to admit the same motivation.  Although Sorge's
 prewar operational activity cannot be denied, his intelligence targets
 were obvious-the German embassy in Tokyo and Japan, Germany's
 ally.  Work against the Nazi, at whatever time it was undertaken,
 would be applauded by Soviet citizens.  Such espionage operations,
 although carried on abroad, can be interpreted as defensive in intent
 and purpose.  The Soviets, it must be noted, have not yet admitted
 that their postwar operations were directed primarily against the
 British and Americans.
 The Soviet authorities may believe that revelations of Western
 espionage against the Soviet Union in recent years call for defensive
 action. Operations such as the U-2 flights and the Popov and
 Penkovskiy penetrations have certainly resulted in talk and specula-
 tion within the USSR.  The Powers and Penkovskiy show trials must
 have convinced even optimistic Soviets that, despite official dis-
 claimers, some harm had been done to Soviet security.  Many must
 have asked, why don't our people do that same thing?  It is: possible,
 therefore, that several terminated espionage operations have been
 surfaced to assure the Soviet people that their government is also
 active in such operations abroad.  The first line of Soviet defense,
 they are being told, is in good hands.
 "Since this article was sent to press an anonymous Soviet study of the role
 of the state security service in the fighting on the German front has become
 available.  By Soviet standards rather copiously footnoted, it gives the service
 a most significant part in the victory and reproves Stalin for not accepting state
 security intelligence reports on German intentions and military plans.  It is
 published tinder the title "Sovetskiye Organy Cosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti v

 ApproSvoedeFcrpR  aoes2005/01 /05 :
 The new publicity is probably designed to improve the image and
 morale of military intelligence and the state security service. The
 Penkovskiy case (and the Popov case as well, although it received
 little publicity) must have been disastrous to the morale of military
 intelligence officers.  State security officers must have been affected
 adversely by previous efforts of the Soviet authorities to create a
 bland image of their service.  Public acclaim of service heroes, even
 of those who at first glance appear to have failed in their missions,
 has undoubtedly improved the tone and morale of both services.
 Such revelations can also be made to serve operational purposes.
 It will be noted that the Soviets use fictionalized biographies to sur-
 face both operations and intelligence agents.  Fictional techniques
 permit the telling of a lively story without need to adhere to the facts
 of the case.  Embarrassing aspects and significant operational details
 may be distorted or omitted without endangering the seeming integrity
 of the account.  Even though not so labeled-possibly because they
 were intended for foreign consumption-the Lonsdale "memoirs"
 are largely fictional. The Soviets have enlisted fiction as an intelli-
 gence weapon.
 Although at first glance it would seem to be a pointless task, these
 fictionalized memoirs and biographies should be subjected to expert
 counterintelligence analysis.  Such accounts must contain at least a
 substratum of fact.   This may be discovered through analysis.  Sig-
 nificant omissions and distortions may be ascertained by comparison
 of the fictionalized versions with data available in counterintelligence
 files.  But the most important purpose of such analysis is the discovery
 of the disinformation objectives that these accounts may serve. We
 must assume that all memoirs, biographies, and historical studies of
 the Soviet intelligence services are prepared with the aid of disin-
 formation experts.
 A careful watch must be kept on this new Soviet program of con-
 trolled intelligence revelations.  Although their goals are not yet
 clear, for the Soviets it is a new technique and one that may do
 serious injury to Western morale.  It must be analyzed and closely
 followed.

 CAMARADE SORGE.  By Nicole Chatel and Alain Guerin.  (Paris:
 Julliard.  1965.  380 pp.  24 francs.)
 This is a French Communist treatment of the famous spy whom
 the Soviets last year so pridefully acknowledged to have worked
 for them in the Far East before and during World War H. Little
 is known of Chatel, but Guerin has for some years worked for the
 Party organ L'Humanite.  An "afterword" is written by Yves Ciampi,
 a Party sympathizer and director of a movie on the Sorge case that
 has been well petted in the Communist press.  Ciampi's Japanese
 actress-wife, Keiko Kishi, who had a role in the film, is said to have
 helped the authors in their researches.
 Chatel and Guerin acknowledge that the book is not a history of
 Sorge and his case but rather a history of their inquiry into it.  The
 six chapters are each in two parts, of which the first, chatty and
 discursive, treats some aspect of Sorge's life, usually by describing
 interviews with supposed acquaintances, and the second is called
 a dossier documenting the foregoing.  Thus they do not tell a con-
 secutive or by any means complete story.
 Perhaps the authors hastened into print to beat a scholarly study
 of the case by two distinguished Oxford dons, Profs. F. W. Deakin
 and G. R. Storry; they allude to this forthcoming work in their text.
 But Camarade Sorge has little to offer in the way of important new
 material.  Rather it is a rehash of Communist outpourings during
 the past year, and it seems just another item in this campaign to
 publicize the heroic activities of Soviet intelligence.

 I SPIED SPIES.  By A. W. Sansom.       (London: Harrap.  1965.
 271 pp.  18/-. )
 One approaches such a book hoping that the title was imposed
 by the publisher and does not reflect the quality of the story. But
 this one is even more swashbuckling than the title promises. The
 author, a Cairo-born insurance salesman with an aptitude for lan-
 guages, became Chief of British Field Security for the Cairo area
 during the Second World War.  He evidently adopted a strong-arm
 approach to upholding the security of the British forces, and he re-
 counts stories of fist and gun fights in the back alleys of Cairo with

 For all his love of adventurous autobiographical anecdote, his book
 is nevertheless a contribution to the operant literature of professional
 officers engaged in personnel and installation security work.  It
 realistically surveys World War II cases of this kind in Cairo, and its
 review of postwar cases is probably still more significant. In par-
 ticular, Sansom's views and frustrations over British defector Donald
 Maclean's activity during his Cairo Embassy tour (pp. 234-41) will
 be shared by many security and counterintelligence officers who have
 had to deal with that kind of problem.
 THE BERLIN WALL.  By Pierre Galante.  (Garden City, N.Y.:
 Dcubleday.  1965. 277 pp.  $4.95.)
 This is the story of the Berlin Wall told in terms of the experiences
 of many little people on whom the barrier had, as it is still having,
 an impact ranging from inconvenience to tragedy.  It is made up of
 isolated incidents loosely linked around a fairly detailed account of
 the adventures of one `Pimpernel of the Wall" who escaped from
 East Berlin and returned repeatedly to engineer group escapes.
 The author, a French journalist, offers much interesting material,
 giving insight into the motives of escapers and escape organizers,
 illustrating the variety of methods of escape, and picturing in general
 the battle of wits between those who would cross the wall and those
 who guard it, a battle in which the guards' advantage inevitably
 increases as loopholes are blocked and new ones become harder to
 find.  On the debit side, parts of the book suffer from over-dramatiza-
 tion and contrived suspense, and its illustration is meager, being
 limited to one tunnel diagram and a sketch map of a small section
 of the wall.  More graphics, including at least one map of the whole
 wall, would have added interest and helped readers find their way
 through a clutter of local names.
 The West can only gain by having the story of the Wall widely
 told.  Galante's book, though in no sense a definitive work, con-
 tributes to this end.
