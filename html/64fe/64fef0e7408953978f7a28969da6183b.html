 Special Issue: Privatization in the
 Middle East and South Asia
 Articles                  Privatization: What Is It, and Why Do They Do It?
 Privatization-the expansion of the privately owned portion of the
 economy-has become an important issue in the Middle East and
 South Asia over the past two years and will remain one for the near
 term. Pragmatism, not an ideological conversion to capitalism, is the
 driving force behind most privatization efforts in the region.
 Aspects of Privatization in the Middle East and South Asia
 A survey of the major economies of the region reveals a wide
 variation in policies toward privatization, the extent to which it has
 taken place, and the conditions that would encourage its further use.
 Saudi Arabia: Promoting Privatization                            9
 Saudi Arabia is seeking increased participation of the private sector
 in the country's development, and, although the government faces
 many problems in implementing its privatization strategy, the
 response of both the Saudi private sector and foreign investors has
 been positive.
 India: Looking to the Private Sector for Helpl                      15
 Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi is trying to stimulate and modernize
 India's economy by opening it to more private sector involvement,
 but he clearly intends that the government control the direction of
 the economy. The attitude of most businessmen to this shift has
 ranged from cautiously optimistic to euphoric.

 Algeria: Liberalizing the Economy
 The failure of Soviet-inspired policies to build an economy capable
 of outlasting the country's petroleum reserves is the principal force
 driving Algeria toward a more market-oriented economic system,
 but the private-sector response has been less than hoped for.
 Tunisia: Prospects for Privatization
 Bleak economic prospects and the political uncertainty generated by
 the impending presidential succession will slow movement toward
 divestiture of public enterprises and limit Tunisia's ability to attract
 foreign capital, and privatization efforts will have to focus on
 streamlining financial institutions and improving agricultural
 efficiency.
 Pakistan: Privatization in Question
 The current slow pace of privatization in Pakistan is unlikely to
 quicken, as the country's new civilian leaders are reluctant to
 antagonize the trade unions and do not want to forgo the patronage
 opportunities associated with economic controls and management of
 large-scale public enterprises.
 The Private Sector in Egypt: Clouded Horizons
 Despite rhetoric proclaiming Cairo's commitment to expansion of
 the private sector, progress in recent years has been slow, and the
 growing economic crisis enveloping Egypt will probably jeopardize
 future private development efforts by forcing the regime to
 concentrate on preserving domestic order.
 Syria: Trying To Tap the Private Sector
 The Syrian economy is a socialist one and will remain so for the near
 term, but the poor state of the economy and a severe shortage of
 foreign exchange are forcing the government to undertake economic
 reforms and to seek ways of tapping the wealth and expertise of the
 private sector.

 Privatization: What Is It,
 and Why Do They Do It?
 Privatization-the expansion of the privately owned
 portion of the economy-has become an important
 issue in the Middle East and South Asia over the past
 two years and will remain one for the near term.' Only
 some countries in the region have privatized, but the
 others have at least had to consider privatization as a
 policy option. Those countries that have privatized
 view this option as a way to stimulate industries that
 have stagnated under public ownership, increase the
 rate of economic growth, alleviate foreign exchange
 shortages, and remedy distorted international trade
 patterns. Countries that have privatized little or not at
 all subscribe to the beliefs that a government's
 political power rests upon its ability to control the
 economy, that economic well-being is best determined
 collectively, and/or that public-sector-dominated
 economies are too fragile to risk major restructuring.
 Pragmatism is the driving force behind most
 privatization efforts in the Middle East and South
 Asia. There has been no widespread ideological
 conversion to capitalism. Instead, some countries have
 realized that the most reasonable alternatives to
 privatization will not work as well and that past
 policies are largely responsible for their present
 economic problems:
 ? In Saudi Arabia, government spending had been the
 engine for economic growth. Because of lower oil
 revenues, government spending has been cut, and
 the current five-year plan has placed increased
 reliance on the private sector to promote
 development and diversification of the economy.
 ' Privatization in the Middle East and South Asia is part of a
 worldwide development, appealing to people as diverse as British
 Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Chinese leader Deng
 Xiaoping.
 ? In India, growing budget deficits and stagnant
 industrial growth have led Prime Minister Rajiv
 Gandhi and his economic advisers to conclude that
 government alone cannot meet the goals set out in
 the Seventh Five-Year Plan.
 ? In Algeria, the failure of Soviet-inspired central
 planning to build an economy capable of outlasting
 the country's petroleum reserves is the main force
 behind privatization.
 ? Tunisia experimented with state socialism but found
 that it led to unsustainable financial losses. It then
 began to seek increased involvement by the private
 sector as the most feasible alternative.
 Pressure from foreign lenders and donors is another
 incentive for privatization. Foreign funds are less
 readily available than they were in the recent past.
 Lenders and donors are beginning to insist that funds
 be allocated more efficiently to produce sustainable
 development.
 Despite these practical considerations, several
 countries have been slow to privatize:
 ? Egypt has been particularly slow in privatizing and
 will remain so unless financial crises and pressure
 from donors force Cairo to change direction.
 ? Syria's economy is, and will remain, basically
 socialist, even though the poor state of the economy
 and a severe shortage of foreign exchange have
 forced the government to try to tap the wealth and
 expertise of the private sector.

 Privatization is the expansion of the private sector,
 usually, but not always, the result of a transfer of
 assets from the public sector. Privatization can occur
 in any of the following ways:
 ? Divestiture is the disposal by the government of all
 of its ownership and control of an enterprise. The
 most common form is sale of the enterprise to an
 individual or group of investors. Bangladesh has
 sold nationalized jute mills to the private sector,
 and Pakistan has sold rice and cotton-ginning
 mills. Sale, however, is not the only form of
 divestiture. Algeria has given state-owned land to
 private "homesteaders" who agree to use it to
 produce food.
 ? Liquidation is an extreme form of divestiture in
 which the government allows, or forces, an
 enterprise to go out of business. It does not directly
 expand the private sector. It usually occurs after an
 extended period of subsidization and after it is
 found that there is no way to make the enterprise
 profitable. India, for instance, may liquidate more
 than two dozen of its "sick" textile mills.
 ? Partial divestiture occurs when the government
 disposes, usually by sale, of some of its ownership
 in a company. By selling less than 50 percent of an
 enterprise, the government retains formal and, in
 some cases, actual control. Pakistan, for instance,
 has decided to sell some shares of Pakistan
 International Airways and the State Oil
 Corporation. Saudi Arabia has begun to privatize
 its $10 billion Saudi Arabian Basic Industries
 Corporation by selling shares to Saudi citizens and
 investors from the Arab Gulf states.
 ? Management contracts are most frequently used
 when the state wishes to retain ownership of an
 enterprise but finds that it needs specially skilled
 labor or managerial talent not available in the
 public sector. For instance, Saudi Arabia has a
 shortage of native health care professionals and
 contracts with private-sector firms-often foreign-
 to run clinics.
 ? Cooperatives are owned by the employees. In the
 Middle East and South Asia, the most common
 form is the agricultural cooperative.
 ? Joint ventures are partnerships between the
 government and a privately owned firm, domestic or
 foreign. India, for instance, is planning to construct
 two oil refineries and a petrochemical plant as joint
 public private ventures.
 A philosophical belief in the efficacy of free markets
 makes privatization more likely.
 ? Tunisian President Bourguiba apparently has come
 to share such a belief. His replacement, in the late
 1960s, of a socialist economic czar with a team of
 technocrats favoring a free-market approach was a
 landmark in Tunisia's privatization efforts. Doubt
 about Bourguiba's successor and a slowdown in
 economic growth have contributed to a slowing in
 the pace of divestiture. Prime Minister Mzali, the
 most likely successor, appears to be as sympathetic
 to the private sector as Bourguiba.
 ? President Bendjedid of Algeria promoted several
 technocrats to key economic ministries in February
 1986. This has been interpreted as an attempt to
 keep his economic reform program on course.
 ? Syrian President Assad's appointment in 1985 of a
 Western-educated economic reformist as Minister
 of Economy and Foreign Trade was both a tacit
 admission of economic problems and a modest
 overture toward the private sector.

 ? Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and many of his
 economic advisers favor increasing the role of the
 private sector in India as well as making the public
 sector more efficient. They have increased the pace
 of the reform program begun by Indira Gandhi.
 In contrast, the dismissal of Mahbubul Haq as
 Finance Minister of Pakistan is clearly a bad omen
 for privatization in that country. Haq, a well-known
 and highly respected economist, was among the most
 vigorous advocates of privatization. His replacement
 is identified with a group opposed to Haq's reforms.
 ? Removal of barriers to entry allows the private
 sector to form companies in fields previously closed
 to it. In India, for example, the government recently
 invited the private sector to invest in the
 manufacture of telecommunications equipment and
 to bid for road construction contracts. Both areas
 had earlier been the exclusive province of the state.
 For privatization to work, there must be not only a
 transfer to assets and/or control to the private sector
 but also creation or stimulation of an environment in
 which less regulated markets can function efficiently.
 Economic growth may suffer when private firms
 cannot survive or function efficiently because of
 restrictive regulations or unfair competition from
 state enterprises.

 Aspects of Privatization in the
 Middle East and South Asia
 A survey of the major economies of the region reveals
 a wide variation in policies toward privatization, the
 extent to which it has taken place, and the conditions
 that would encourage its further use.
 Prospects for More Privatization
 Countries of the region vary widely in their prospects
 for further privatization. Prospects for further
 privatization are best in countries that were relatively
 wealthy before privatization and that have a relatively
 bright economic outlook. All four countries with very
 high prospects for further privatization are wealthy
 Persian Gulf oil producers: Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi
 Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Algeria, with
 the strongest economy in north Africa, has high
 prospects, as does India, which has experienced good
 economic growth recently. Such countries would have
 turned to the private sector even without their recent
 revenue problems. In each of these countries much of
 the infrastructure-roads, schools, and power
 networks-required for strong economic growth is
 already in place, often provided by the government. In
 addition, numerous countries, especially the
 hydrocarbon producers, are diversifying their
 economies, particularly into industries that do not
 require large amounts of capital. Algeria's recent five-
 year plan, which is probably typical of others,
 specifically mentions agriculture, tourism, retail
 trade, and the production of consumer goods as areas
 in which private-sector participation is to be
 encouraged.
 leadership change in Syria, but the Syrians are
 beginning to try to tap the wealth and expertise of the
 private sector.
 Strength of the Opposition
 There is almost always some opposition to
 privatization, which may come from any combination
 of the following:
 ? Trade unions, such as those in India, whose leaders
 have attacked Gandhi's program as "antilabor"
 because it allegedly encourages plant closings and
 provides no relief for displaced workers.
 Unorganized labor may resist for the same reasons
 but will not be as effective.
 ? Industrialists who previously operated in sheltered
 markets and who now may have to face increased
 competition. Old-line industrialists in India may
 join labor in resisting Gandhi's changes.
 ? Bureaucrats who use public-sector firms as sources
 of patronage. They have, for example, been effective
 in slowing the pace of privatization in Pakistan.
 ? Consumers who receive subsidies through the
 artificially low prices that public-sector firms often
 charge for goods.
 ? Suppliers who are often paid artificially high prices
 for inputs.
 Leader's Commitment
 The leader's commitment to privatization seems to be
 the strongest determinant of the prospects for more
 privatization. Change in leadership often brings about
 change in the degree of commitment to privatization.
 Egyptian President Mubarak has encouraged private-
 sector activity less than did Sadat and Sadat more
 than Nasir. Although President Bendjedid has not
 privatized extensively in Algeria, he has done more
 than Boumediene. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
 increased the pace of the reform program begun in
 India by Indira Gandhi. In contrast, there has been no
 The success of privatization may depend upon the
 relative intensity of the leader's commitment and the
 strength of the opposition. In every case in which the
 prospects for further privatization are very high, the
 leader's commitment is very high and the strength of
 the opposition is very low. In every case in which the
 prospects are low or very low, the strength of the
 opposition is higher than the strength of the leader's
 commitment.

 Secret
 Lender/Donor Interest
 A published survey of the World Bank reports that
 the Bank has increased the emphasis it places on the
 private sector. The International Finance
 Corporation, an arm of the Bank, was created to
 specialize in financing private-sector businesses in
 developing countries and had its funding doubled in
 late 1984. In late 1985 the Bank was also organizing
 the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency to
 insure private-sector projects in less developed
 countries against noncommercial risks such as
 expropriation, breach of contract by host
 governments, and civil unrest.
 We believe that lenders and donors do not exert
 substantial influence in bringing about privatization
 in the countries of the Middle East and South Asia.
 Those countries in the region that are most likely to
 privatize are not borrowers nor recipients of aid.
 Further, it is not clear that most lenders or donors
 would withhold funds over the issue of privatization.
 Quality and Quantity of Preparatory Studies
 According to published sources, privatization is most
 likely to succeed when it is based on extensive
 preparatory studies. Less developed countries, in
 general, and some Middle Eastern countries in
 particular, present problems that do not arise in more
 developed countries. Evaluating the worth of an
 enterprise is often difficult, especially in countries
 that do not observe standard accounting practices.
 Pakistan, for instance, attempts to measure the
 "social profitability" of many enterprises and tries to
 factor various measures of social welfare into
 computations also involving economic profitability.
 Because the privatized firm will not have the same
 objectives as it did when it was a public firm, the
 existing valuation is of only limited use.
 Cost-benefit studies are often needed to indicate
 which firms to privatize. According to an official of
 the World Bank, there may be no net benefit to
 society if a public monopoly is sold to the private
 sector. only to become a private monopoly. Moreover,
 because privatization almost always incurs opposition
 and will often be costly, studies will usually be
 necessary to ascertain whether the gain from
 increased efficiency exceeds the loss sustained by
 those who are made worse off plus the cost of the
 privatization.
 The quality and quantity of the studies being done in
 the Middle East and South Asia appear to be at best
 mediocre. Only in Egypt, Sudan, and Tunisia are the
 quantity and quality of these studies higher than the
 general prospects for further privatization. Neither
 Egypt nor Sudan, however, seems likely to take action
 based upon those studies for the near term.
 Access to Entrepreneurship
 For a region with so many developing countries, the
 Middle East and South Asia has an uncommonly high
 degree of access to entrepreneurship, according to a
 US official who works on privatization in this and
 other regions. In several countries there is an
 established merchant or trading class with a long
 tradition. Where no such tradition exists, or where
 there are few experienced entrepreneurs, there is often
 an acceptance of the use of foreigners to serve as
 managers and entrepreneurs. This is frequently seen
 when privatization involves the creation of a new
 enterprise rather than the transfer of an enterprise,
 with its management, from the public to the private
 sector. For example, several Persian Gulf oil
 producers, which do not have enough entrepreneurs to
 manage all the firms that they wish to create as they
 diversify their economies, are relying on such devices
 as management contracts to enlist foreign
 entrepreneurs. Where decolonization was relatively
 peaceful, as in Tunisia, there was often access to
 Western enterpreneurial talent.
 Capacity of Local Financial Market
 Less developed countries, by their nature, rarely have
 well-developed, high-volume financial markets. This
 is true of most Middle Eastern and South Asian
 countries, with most of the exceptions being Persian
 Gulf oil producers. Lack of adequate financial
 markets tends to limit privatization, with most of it
 taking place in the smaller "cottage" industries.
 Without adequate financial markets it is difficult to

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/01/09: CIA-RDP87T00289R000200820001-7
 form groups of investors with sufficient funds to
 purchase or form large corporations. For instance, the
 fact that Pakistan's largest stock exchange has never
 raised more than $24 million in a year is a factor that
 will probably limit privatization efforts there.
 Acceptance of Foreign Investors
 If local financial markets cannot provide adequate
 funding, funds may be obtained from foreign
 investors. Nevertheless, we do not expect willingness
 to accept foreign investment to alleviate the problem
 significantly because of the hesitancy of foreigners to
 invest in many countries in the region. The countries
 most willing to accept foreign investment include
 Bangladesh, Egypt, Jordan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, and
 Syria-none of which is especially appealing to
 investors. Special restrictions, such as Syria's refusal
 to accept Western investors and Tunisia's limits on
 foreign participation, may further discourage
 investors.
 Reluctance To Take Over Money-Losing Firms
 Governmental reluctance to continue taking over
 money-losing enterprises is often the first sign that
 policy may be changing in favor of privatization. The
 announcement by the Pakistani Government that
 money-losers would no longer be nationalized was an
 early indication of such a change. The public sector
 often has grown as governments absorb money-losing
 firms to avoid letting them go out of business. Often
 there is pressure from labor to protect jobs or a
 perceived economic or national security reason to keep
 the enterprise open.
 Liquidation of Money-Losing Firms
 Liquidation of money-losing firms involves tougher
 decisions and a more active policy in favor of
 privatization and thus would be an even stronger
 indication of commitment to privatization than is the
 reluctance to absorb such firms. There appears to be
 little enthusiasm for liquidation anywhere in the
 region.
 Privatization of Money-Making Firms
 The sale of an enterprise that makes a profit for the
 government would be a particularly strong indicator
 that decisionmakers believe the business belongs in
 the private sector. Of the three countries-Kuwait,
 Iran, and Pakistan-with a high willingness to sell
 money-makers, the Kuwaiti leader's commitment to
 privatization is very high; in Iran there is one faction
 with a high commitment; and, until the recent change
 in government, the leaders in Pakistan had a very high
 commitment to privatization.
 Privatization of Firms in Key Sectors
 Throughout the region there is strong unwillingness to
 extend privatization to those sectors that produce
 large percentages of the GNP or that are deemed
 strategic. Even Saudi Arabia and Bahrain-which
 seem otherwise very willing to privatize-will not
 privatize the oil sector.
 Average Amount of Capital Used by Firms That Are
 Privatized
 Privatized firms in the region tend to have relatively
 little capital. Saudi Arabia is the only country with a
 very high average amount of capital in privatized
 firms. That is probably because of a combination of
 Saudi wealth and the success the Saudis have had in
 requiring firms from industrialized countries to invest
 portions of large contracts in Saudi firms. There are
 several reasons the average amount of capital used by
 privatized firms is low in the rest of the region:
 ? The diversification efforts of several countries
 involve a move away from highly capitalized
 industries such as oil and/or hydrocarbons to lower
 capitalized activities.
 ? Capital markets often cannot provide funding for
 projects requiring large amounts of capital, and
 foreigners are unwilling to invest in several of the
 countries of the region.
 ? Where the government is not enthusiastic-or is
 hostile-to the private sector, remaining small may
 be wise. In Syria, for instance, private firms are
 safe, provided they do not grow large enough to
 attract the government's attention.

 Saudi Arabia:
 Promoting Privatization
 Saudi Arabia is seeking increased participation of the
 private sector in the country's development. The focus
 on privatization has been stimulated by the decline in
 government revenues and Riyadh's hope that a more
 active private sector will offset the impact of reduced
 public spending. Although the government faces
 many challenges in implementing its privatization
 strategy, the Saudi private-sector response has been
 positive. In addition, foreign firms recognize the
 opportunities that exist for lucrative joint ventures
 despite the current recession. Saudi Arabia is a
 politically stable country with few exchange or capital
 restrictions and generous investment incentives. US
 firms are likely to benefit from the privatization effort
 because Riyadh is seeking projects that promote
 technology transfer and management training, areas
 in which US firms often have a competitive
 advantage.
 Economic Readjustment
 Saudi Government spending has served as the engine
 for economic growth in the kingdom since the oil
 boom days of the early 1970s. Using oil revenues,
 Riyadh has generated employment, consumer
 demand, capital formation, and industrial,
 agricultural, banking, and commercial activity. It has
 also built a modern infrastructure-now essentially
 complete-carried out under contract by foreign and
 domestic firms. In addition, it subsidizes a wide range
 of goods and services for Saudis and underwrites the
 operations of specialized credit institutions that
 supply most of the private sector's long-term capital
 needs. Although the private sector has been active,
 particularly in trade and construction, its role has
 been overshadowed by the public sector.
 to public-sector employees. It also stretched out
 payments to contractors, began to monitor contracts
 more closely, and started competitive tendering for
 government contracts.
 Because of budgetary constraints Riyadh is hoping
 that the private sector will assume a greater role in
 economic growth and development, according to
 Saudi press reports. In any case, as capital-intensive
 infrastructure and industrial projects were completed,
 Riyadh had planned to increase the private-sector
 role, and this sector has been expanding since 1980
 because of government incentives. The recession,
 however, prompted Riyadh to try to use the private
 sector to counteract the contractionary effects of
 reduced government spending.
 The Fourth Five-Year Plan
 Saudi Arabia's $277 billion Fourth Five-Year Plan
 (1985-90), released last spring, focuses on
 privatization and diversification as the means to
 stimulate economic growth. According to the plan, the
 government hopes to limit its role to regulatory and
 promotional functions and to allow the private sector
 to meet the kingdom's demands for goods, services,
 and facilities. The key objectives in the plan involving
 the private sector are:
 ? To increase opportunities for the private sector to
 acquire, manage, and operate projects currently
 operated by the government.
 ? To encourage greater participation of the private
 sector in the financing of development.
 ? To encourage and facilitate private-sector
 investment in new products and to encourage banks
 to provide increased credit facilities for productive
 projects instead of concentrating on trade financing.
 ? To encourage the establishment of joint stock
 The decline in oil revenues beginning in 1982 forced
 Riyadh to trim its budget expenditures, a move that
 caused a ripple effect throughout the economy. The
 construction sector was hit hard when large
 government-funded projects were postponed or
 canceled. Riyadh cut the budgets of most government
 ministries and reduced some allowances and benefits
 companies.
 Government planners expect nonoil GDP to grow
 3 percent a year over the course of the Fourth Five-
 Year Plan, slightly slower than the 5 percent a year

 private Saudi investors. It intends to increase the use
 of joint ventures with foreign firms to capitalize on
 technical and business expertise.
 Privatization Begins
 The private-sector response to Riyadh's privatization
 strategy has been positive. The government has been
 selling shares in the state-owned Saudi Basic
 Industries Corporation (SABIC) since 1984. Its aim is
 to offer 20 percent of SABIC's $10 billion stock for
 public subscription every two years until 75 percent is
 in the hands of Saudis and investors from the Arab
 Gulf states, according to Western press. The initial
 sale was heavily oversubscribed.
 The success of the initial SABIC divestiture has led
 Riyadh to consider selling other government firms.
 Last October, Riyadh proposed the privatization of
 Petromin, the Saudi state oil company
 Under the proposal,
 Petromin will remain a state-controlled organization
 and operate as a holding company. Up to half of the
 shares in its various subsidiaries, including domestic
 and export refineries, would be sold to the publi
 hopes that such sales will attract some of the
 estimated $20 billion believed to be in the possession
 of Saudi citizens. Riyadh would promise to continue
 subsidizing these organizations to convince investors
 that they will provide a good return,
 The government is also encouraging investment in
 new small- and medium-size manufacturing and
 services. Last spring it established the National
 Industrialization Company (NIC), a joint
 government-private enterprise that would establish
 industrial projects with Saudi capital and in
 conjunction with foreign partners. Within a few
 months of its launching, however, Riyadh announced
 that the NIC would be a wholly private venture. This
 announcement dampened investor interest in the
 NIC. Most were reluctant to invest in industrial
 ventures with no government participation. The NIC
 still hopes to raise $170 million from banks and
 industrial groups, with 75 percent held by the Saudi
 public. NIC's target is to set up about 10 new
 concerns each year, sharing 50 to 60 percent of the
 equity with foreign partners, according to Western
 press. Another venture capital group was formed last
 December. It includes 30 leading Saudi businessmen
 who will conduct feasibility studies and allow its
 underwriters the first option to invest in those projects
 that go forward, according to the US Embassy in
 Riyadh.
 raw materials.
 Riyadh supports joint ventures with foreign firms and
 developed the Peace Shield offset program to use the
 kingdom's high level of defense spending to promote
 economic diversification, technology transfer, private-
 sector growth, and job training. The program
 stipulates that foreign contractors who participate in
 Peace Shield-$5 billion worth of projects to improve
 Saudi air defenses and communications-must place
 35 percent of the value of goods and services they
 provide in high-technology ventures in the kingdom.
 Boeing, which won the first $1.1 billion Peace Shield
 contract, has proposed nine offset projects, including
 the establishment of factories for the production of
 telecommunications, avionic equipment, and medical
 supplies. General Electric, another contractor, has
 proposed the construction of an aircraft engine
 overhaul and repair facility. Moreover, foreign firms
 involved in offset projects are offered a wide range of
 investment incentives, including concessionary
 financing; a 10-year corporate tax holiday;
 government funding to cover the training of Saudi
 employees; provision of low-cost land, utilities, and

 Buyers must pay in cash when they place their orders.
 Except for citizens of the Arab Gulf states, no
 foreigners are allowed to buy shares in Saudi
 companies
 Riyadh has taken other initiatives to increase the
 private-sector role in development finance. It is
 encouraging commercial banks, which had
 concentrated lending on trade finance, office
 construction, and providing working capital for
 manufacturers, to broaden their services and thus help
 sustain private-sector growth. To support these banks,
 the government has imposed restrictions on offshore
 banks-primarily Bahraini-that had attracted large
 amounts of Saudi business by exploiting the
 competitive advantages accruing to it as an offshore
 banking center. The Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency
 also created Bankers Security Deposit Accounts,
 designed to reduce excess domestic liquidity. These
 instruments function like US Treasury bills and are
 offered to domestic banks on a discounted basis. F_
 Riyadh believes that to facilitate privatization, the
 private sector will have to become more competitive
 by restructuring and focusing greater attention on
 management, organization, marketing, and
 accounting methods, according to the Saudi press.
 Saudi firms, for example, lack generally accepted
 accounting principles under which to operate, and
 that makes it difficult for investors to evaluate
 companies. The government intends to facilitate
 private-sector restructuring and has begun to insist on
 greater financial discipline from companies requiring
 loans. It also is planning national and regional trade
 exhibitions, as well as conferences on management
 and marketing.
 Outlook
 Saudi Arabia's privatization efforts will continue to
 strengthen the economy. Although the effects of the
 lingering recession will persist, government efforts to
 foster the private sector should reduce the economy's
 vulnerability to oil market fluctuations. We do not
 expect a rapid transition as Riyadh seeks to establish
 a partnership between the private and public sectors
 without causing disruptions. The business community
 appears eager to take a larger role and expects real
 growth over the next five years despite the recession
 and the poor outlook for the oil market, according to
 press reports.
 The government, however, will retain its dominant
 role in the economy. It will work to attract private
 capital to specific enterprises and seek greater public
 participation in the development process, but it will
 not turn over control of key areas-particularly oil-
 to the private sector. The private sector probably will
 not push for a significantly larger role in the economy
 until economic conditions improve, because investors
 are careful not to risk participating in enterprises
 without government backing.
 Riyadh's privatization strategy so far has been well
 received by the Saudi public, but the government
 faces several challenges as it continues to implement
 its program. Although Riyadh wants to protect its
 infant industries, it is reluctant to erect new trade
 barriers because it wants to avoid foreign retaliation,
 especially against its petrochemical exports. Thus,
 many of the import substitution enterprises it hopes
 the private sector will develop may not prove viable.
 The Saudis have yet to develop commercial laws to
 deal with the complexities of a modern financial
 system. Without this legal framework, banks are left
 with little protection and are reluctant to play a larger
 role in the private sector. Developing such a
 framework is difficult because it involves a
 compromise between the religious community and the
 commercial sector. The stock market is relatively
 inactive, in part because of extensive government
 regulations. As Riyadh's need to stimulate investment
 grows, the benefits of a strong market may outweigh
 Saudi conservatism and bring about a cautious
 liberalization of regulations.
 Riyadh's emphasis on joint ventures with foreign
 firms will benefit US firms. In the past few years the
 number of joint-venture companies has increased
 significantly, and at present there are approximately
 800 operating in the kingdom. The United States has

 India: Looking to the Private
 Sector for Help
 Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi is trying to stimulate
 and modernize India's economy by opening it to more
 private-sector involvement. Growing government
 budget deficits and stagnant industrial growth have
 made it apparent to Gandhi and his advisers that the
 government alone cannot accomplish the goals for
 economic growth set forth in the new five-year plan.
 Opening more of the economy to the private sector
 will offer new opportunities to Western businessmen.
 Gandhi clearly intends that the government control
 the direction of the economy. Although easing
 restrictions on private businesses, he has retained the
 basic structure of industrial licensing, preferences for
 small producers, and close supervision of large
 corporate groups. Gandhi apparently has no plans to
 rely completely on market forces to allocate basic
 consumer goods. He will continue the public
 distribution system that supplies grain to urban
 consumers and supports prices farmers receive for
 major crops.
 The Public and Private Sectors
 The Indian private sector produces about three-
 quarters of the national income. It is dominated by
 small-scale agriculture and a relatively limited
 modern industrial sector.
 The central government is firmly entrenched as the
 prime mover and major source of direction for the
 economy, particularly the nonagricultural sector. The
 Indian Government-like other governments in less
 developed countries-inherited the major public
 utilities at independence and subsequently increased
 the industrial activities it owned or controlled-from
 five enterprises to more than 200, accounting for more
 than 70 percent of industrial production. Government
 control over all economic activity has become
 pervasive through subsidies and regulations.
 Expansion of the Indian public sector paralleled
 public growth in other formerly colonial economies.
 The government's current focus on the private sector
 also parallels that of other Middle Eastern and South
 Asian countries.
 Government ownership ranges from heavy industries
 to consumer goods. The public-sector share of
 production is 97 percent for coal, 100 percent for
 crude oil and refining, 75 percent for basic steel,
 55 percent for fertilizer, and 93 percent for power
 generation. The public sector also accounts for the
 production of most heavy engineering equipment, runs
 the railways and telecommunication services, owns
 more than 90 percent of the banking industry, and
 monopolizes the life insurance business.
 Constraints to Economic Growth
 Indian studies indicate much of the public sector has
 become stagnant and inefficient because of
 government control and lack of competition.
 Government statistics show that 200 public-sector
 companies together earned a mere 0.8 percent on
 capital invested in Indian fiscal year 1983. In
 contrast, the large- and medium-size private
 companies showed a return on capital of about
 6 percent. The low rate of return in the public sector
 has led to an increasing gap between saving and
 investment in that sector.
 The last five-year plan fell 18 percent short of planned
 expenditures primarily because state enterprises could
 not provide the necessary resources. Large
 government budget deficits caused by growing
 government salaries, subsidies on food and fertilizer,
 and defense spending and declining productivity
 resulting from increases in the amount of capital
 needed for public-sector production are making it
 difficult for the government to free additional funds
 for economic development.
 Gandhi's Pragmatic Approach
 The inability of public enterprises and the central
 government to generate the resources for development
 have contributed to Gandhi's push for more private-
 sector involvement. Finance Minister V. P. Singh has

 stated, "Our policy comes not from textbooks but
 from three points of hard reality-rupee resource
 constraints, foreign exchange constraints, and
 poverty." In the current five-year plan (FY 1984-89)
 the government is looking to the private sector to
 provide 52.2 percent of total investment of
 $273 billion compared to 47 percent under the
 preceding plan. About 10 percent of the private
 investment is projected to come from external sources.
 Rajiv has publicly pressed for more private-sector
 initiative. He has emphasized that "many things
 could be done better" by private organizations,
 leaving the leaner government to concentrate on such
 things as development of infrastructure-roads,
 irrigation, and energy. Several of his ministers and
 many government economic advisers-some of whom
 have philosophies that are oriented to free markets-
 also are promoting the private sector. Government
 efforts include large issues of bonds to raise funds for
 public corporations, reduction of controls on existing
 business operations, and provision of incentives to
 expand production and exports:
 ? Indian Telephone Industries and the National
 Thermal Power Corporation placed large bond
 issues-more than $80 million each-on the market
 in February 1986; the Rural Electrification
 Corporation was to float a major bond issue in
 March; and the Indian Petrochemicals Corporation,
 Ltd. is preparing an issue for later release.
 ? Private companies are being invited to invest in
 telecommunications equipment-ending the
 monopoly of the public sector.
 ? Licenses are no longer needed to establish or expand
 capacity in 25 industries including machine tools,
 automobile parts, scientific instruments, and some
 electronic components, provided the manufacture
 does not occur in a major city.
 ? Manufacturers of motor vehicles, paper products,
 and some types of machinery and electronic goods
 may now vary their product mix within broad
 categories.
 ? Antimonopoly legislation, which imposes additional
 restrictions on production and investment, will now
 apply to only about 800 corporations compared with
 more than 3,000 in 1984.
 ? New import licensing regulations remove
 restrictions on some industrial machinery and offer
 a new duty-free import scheme for exporters.
 ? Maximum interest rates on bank loans to private
 enterprises have been reduced.
 ? Corporate and personal tax rates have been lowered,
 and a long-term fiscal policy calling for stability in
 corporate and personal tax rates during the life of
 the current plan has been proposed.
 The government also has opened major projects to be
 funded independently by the private sector or as joint
 ventures, and in areas long barred to private-sector
 participation:
 ? The government proposes to invite private bids for
 road construction and to finance it through toll
 collections.
 ? Two new oil refineries and a petrochemical plant are
 being proposed as joint ventures.
 ? All six fertilizer plants scheduled to be built using
 offshore gas are to be allotted to private enterprises.
 The government is moving cautiously away from
 supporting industries that are inefficient or losing
 money. The government hopes to avoid taking over
 "sick" industrial units to save jobs. It also proposes
 the liquidation or sale of government-owned units that
 chronically lose money and have no chance of
 becoming viable. At the top of the list is the closure or
 sale of 26 of the 100 or so "sick" textile mills. Other
 candidates include two bicycle manufacturing units.
 Other measures under consideration include reducing
 the state equity in some profit-making enterprises and
 inviting experts from the private sector to serve as
 directors on the boards of major public-sector
 undertakings. The Steel Authority of India, the

 been losing heavily, while the country's oldest private
 steel plant, operated by the Tata family, has been
 running profitably. Press reports indicate Gandhi may
 also open production of defense materials to the
 private sector.
 Private-Sector Response
 Although we believe specific measures to ease
 government restrictions on private production and
 investment thus far have been moderate, the attitude
 of most businessmen has ranged from cautiously
 optimistic to euphoric:
 ? Finance Ministry approval of new private-sector
 issues of securities jumped by 40 percent in April
 through December 1985 from the comparable period
 in 1984.
 ? Applications for investment authority rose from
 1,064 in 1984 to 1,271 in the first 11 months in 1985,
 and the number of industrial licenses issued rose
 from 905 to 925.
 ? The stock market index rose from 135 in December
 1984 to 232 in December 1985 (1980-81=100).
 ? The value of new security issues sold on the capital
 markets in 1985 increased by 50 percent over 1984,
 and investors have begun to think in terms of larger
 issues than would have been possible only a year
 ago.
 ? Private industrial borrowing increased 9.2 percent
 in April through December 1985 over the same
 period in 1984.
 More Privatization Likely
 Greater involvement by the private sector-both
 domestic and foreign-appears to be India's most
 promising means of achieving significant economic
 growth over the next five years. We believe the private
 sector could undertake its portion of the development
 program and that private foreign capital would be
 available if the government continues to relax its
 control over the economy. As long as Rajiv Gandhi
 remains Prime Minister, we see steady, if slow
 movement toward more private-sector involvement.
 Reliable economics press reports state that the World
 Bank is generally pleased with the results of past
 projects. We believe that future projects will be
 funded.
 The pace of privatization is likely to be determined by
 the severity of the political obstacles encountered.
 There remain some people in the leadership, and more
 in the bureaucracy, who are accustomed to the system
 of state enterprises and government controls and are
 resisting change. Critics of Gandhi's program,
 including many in his ruling Congress Party, charge
 that his liberalization measures favor the rich and
 middle class at the expense of the poor. Price
 increases and the elimination of subsidies, necessary if
 the government is going to give more incentives to the
 private sector, are likely to create problems with the
 urban poor.
 New Delhi's commitment to more privatization also
 will be tested if unemployment increases. Government
 liberalization of economic controls and regulations is
 likely to come under increased trade union pressure.
 A key union leader has already attacked the policy as
 "antilabor" because it encouraged plant closings and
 provided no relief for workers laid off. Urban unrest is
 also likely if unemployment rises rapidly.
 Although the great majority of Indian businessmen
 welcome the promotion of the private sector and the
 removal of restrictions, there is a sense of concern,
 particularly among more established and old-line
 industrialists. The latter increasingly realize that open
 competition will mean the survival of only firms that
 are efficient and responsive to consumers. This is a
 concept alien to industrialists who have thrived in a
 largely protected sellers' market.
 Implications for the United States
 Greater Indian reliance on a market-oriented
 economy as well as a more open attitude toward
 foreign investment will increase opportunities for US
 businesses to enter one of the world's largest markets.
 Since 1980, US companies have been the leaders in

 months of 1985, 92 collaborations were approved, and
 the number probably exceeded 200 for the year-a
 record high. Indian companies are eager to increase
 imports of high-technology equipment, particularly in
 the electronic, motor vehicle, and telecommunication
 industries, and the government is willing to allow
 foreign participation if foreign companies transfer
 technology, get involved in the production of export
 goods, or offer equity participation that saves Indian
 foreign exchange in capital-intensive projects such as
 refining and fertilizer plants.

 Algeria:
 Liberalizing the Economy
 The failure of Soviet-inspired policies to build an
 economy capable of outlasting the country's
 petroleum reserves is the principal force driving
 Algeria toward a more market-oriented economic
 system. Under the direction of President Chadli
 Bendjedid, Algeria has begun dismantling state
 monopolies and incorporating private enterprise into
 its development programs. To date, the private-sector
 response has been less than hoped for because the
 bureaucracy has not created an environment
 conducive to private enterprise and would-be
 entrepreneurs are unsure of the role they are expected
 to play. Continued liberalization depends heavily on
 worldwide hydrocarbon developments. Greatly
 reduced oil and gas earnings could jeopardize
 Algeria's ability to provide necessary financial
 incentives to private investors. To the extent that a
 collapse of private investment can be cited by
 Bendjedid's opponents as the primary cause for
 Algeria's economic problems, he may feel compelled
 to reinstitute widespread state control of the economy.
 Bendjedid's continuing efforts to open Algeria to the
 West will create new opportunities for US trade and
 investment, and he will view the response of US firms
 as an important indicator of how close a relationship
 Washington wants.
 The Boumediene Economic System
 The economic policies of President Houari
 Boumediene (1965-78) were aimed at using oil
 revenues and Soviet-inspired economic principles to
 make Algeria the "Japan of the Mediterranean." To
 realize his goal, Boumediene nationalized oil and gas
 companies in 1971 and implemented two Soviet-style
 development plans (1970-73 and 1974-77). Both plans
 were geared toward rapidly expanding the state's role
 in the economy. Over time, all key industrial sectors,
 foreign trade, banking, and insurance became state
 monopolies. Even agriculture fell largely under state
 control.
 Highly centralized planning, inefficient marketing
 and input systems, inadequate production incentives,
 and a lack of skilled farm managers contributed to a
 more than 50-percent decline in production. The
 declining share of investment allocated to agriculture
 compounded these problems, especially the failure to
 exploit the nation's water resources.'
 Algeria's favored industrial sector also ran into
 trouble. Modern business techniques such as
 inventory control, production scheduling, and
 distribution were poorly managed. The level of
 technology insisted upon by planners was often
 beyond the capability of the local work force,
 fostering dependence on foreign technicians rather
 than upgrading the skills of Algerian workers. Soviet-
 style central planning also proved ineffective in
 matching production with demand. As a result, the
 country installed expensive industrial plants whose
 output did not match domestic needs. Guaranteed
 wages also hindered productivity gains and made
 production costs for locally made goods considerably
 higher than for imported products. As a result, the
 utilization rate of existing industrial capacity,
 was only about
 Boumediene's industrialization drive also had harsh
 social implications. Serious strains on services
 developed as Algerians left the countryside and
 crowded into urban areas in search of jobs. Food
 shortages were commonplace, a result of declining
 agricultural production and accelerated rural
 migration to the cities. With heavy industry favored
 over other production, shortages of consumer goods
 were widespread. Domestic demand for such goods as
 automobiles, televisions, and refrigerators far
 exceeded supply-resulting in a thriving black
 market. Inflation during the late 1970s was as high as
 18 percent on an annual basis.
 Oil-spurred economic growth-averaging 7 percent
 annually during 1974-78-masked serious problems
 in the economy. Agriculture was particularly hard hit.

 two-thirds of its food]

 Reorientation Under Bendjedid
 Chadli Bendjedid's public statements indicate that he,
 unlike his predecessor, sees private investment as
 essential to building a highly diversified economy that
 will outlast the country's oil reserves. As a result,
 Algeria's economic development strategy has
 undergone a significant shift under his leadership.
 Bendjedid's initial $104 billion, five-year development
 plan (1980-84) called for striking changes focusing on
 decentralization of the state-controlled economy and
 an increased role for the private sector. Agriculture,
 tourism, retail trade, and the production of consumer
 goods were specifically mentioned as areas in which
 the private sector was to be encouraged to
 participate-a radical departure from previous plans,
 which completely ignored private enterprise.
 A 4-percent annual increase in agricultural
 production was targeted under the plan. Agricultural
 reform emphasized the reorganization of the large
 nationalized sector comprising 2,000 farms into
 smaller, albeit still primarily state-controlled units.
 Managers were to be given greater autonomy and
 responsibility to increase productivity. The
 government also pledged to expand extension services
 to include independent farmers as well as the
 nationalized farms to encourage greater private
 participation. Nearly half of the $12 billion allocated
 to agriculture was to be for much-needed
 improvements in the use of water resources, to the
 benefit of both private and public farming.
 Government plans for light industrial expansion
 included projects to increase the production of
 construction materials, textiles, and processed food.
 Tax reforms and improved access to credit, land, and
 equipment were to be instituted under the plan to
 encourage private participation. Heavy industry,
 including hydrocarbons, remained under state control.
 Bendjedid's Report Card
 Algeria's development efforts produced only mixed
 results during 1980-84, largely because of declining
 oil and gas revenues that limited spending-half of
 planned investment went unfunded-and to what
 government officials cite as a disappointing response
 from the private sector. We believe the limited
 private-sector response was in part because the
 appropriate environment had not been created.
 Moreover, would-be entrepreneurs, used to nearly two
 decades of extensive state control, probably were
 hesitant to do much without concrete guidance from
 the government. Supporting these judgments is a
 recent Algerian review of private-sector activities,
 which noted that private investment under the plan
 occurred without clear orientation or control from
 Algiers.
 Private activity in agricultural production provides
 some interesting insights into why local investors
 hesitate to become involved. Although the data are
 sketchy, private-sector participation in agriculture
 was apparently limited largely by bureaucratic
 barriers. Embassy sources indicate the Algerian
 bureaucracy was slow to turn to private entrepreneurs
 after years of dealing primarily with collective farms.
 The average private farmer, for example, was forced
 to accept government feed deliveries-with no control
 over timing or quality-because he was prohibited
 from importing his own needs. Furthermore,
 according to the Embassy, even if a farmer was
 resourceful enough to arrange a contract to
 supplement state supplies, the government routinely
 denied him the requisite foreign exchange. The
 average farmer also had trouble procuring drugs and
 veterinary services-government veterinarians
 received no additional pay for servicing private farms.
 State control over the marketing of domestically
 produced farm products also limited individual farm
 production. Prices paid by the state were often far
 below cost and certainly below market prices. The
 government's inability to provide needed tractors and
 equipment to new farmers under its land
 redistribution program also limited output
 The gains recorded by private interests in light
 industry were far more encouraging than in
 agriculture. According to Embassy reporting, about
 1,200 private projects valued at some $800 million
 were approved by the government. Most of these
 undertakings were concentrated in large urban
 centers where access to goods, labor, and capital was
 most convenient. The projects were primarily in

 El Oued: Economic Development in the Desert
 Local development in El Oued Province is a prime
 example of the positive effects of government
 emphasis on private-sector participation in the
 economy. El Oued is one of 17 new administrative
 districts in Algeria. According to the provincial
 governor, this change has brought increased state
 funds to the area and has led to rapid improvements
 in health, education, and housing. These upgraded
 living conditions, in turn, have improved the ability of
 the local population to focus their efforts more on
 production for profit rather than for survival. Qreatly
 encouraging private-sector initiative.
 El Oued leaders are further encouraging private
 participation-in line with regional goals set forth in
 the 1985-89 development plan-by prodding farmers
 to participate in a program designed to gradually
 shift local production from dates, their traditional
 crop, to food production. The governor has directed
 the building of five socialist agricultural villages-
 each with housing for 200 families, schools, mosques,
 and health clinics-to help accomplish this goal. In
 these villages, farmers will till their land and retain
 their profits but plant crops selected by district
 planners. According to the governor, this program is
 popular, and he expects El Oued to be self-sufficient
 in food in the next five to 10 years.
 Local officials have encouraged the establishment of
 privately owned light industrial projects in such
 diverse areas as food processing, cosmetics, and
 construction. Some firms, according to the governor,
 employ as many as 200 to 300 workers. Officials plan
 to encourage entrepreneurs to base new industrial
 ventures on local resources and needs for example,
 a glass works using the area's fine sands. There are
 no plans to allow creation of privately owned heavy
 industrial projects, however, as decreed in the
 national development plan
 "easy" activities that did not require too much risk or
 large investment of time or energy, and, above all, had
 the potential for quick profits. Embassy reporting
 indicates as many as 20,000 new jobs were created in
 such industries as building materials, textiles, and

 Looking Ahead
 Although Algeria has the strongest economy in North
 Africa, we believe Bendjedid realizes he must
 continue his diversification and liberalization efforts
 to ensure Algeria's economic viability.
 pragmatism, not
 ideology, is the standard by which the contributions of
 both the public and private sectors of the economy
 will be assessed. To encourage an even greater
 contribution from nongovernment sources, the role of
 the private sector has been more specifically defined
 in the recently implemented $110 billion 1985-89
 development plan. Officials have been ordered to
 integrate private-sector activities into traditionally
 public-sector arenas to meet plan goals. Private
 industry is to "contribute to the expansion of Algeria's
 overall productive capacity, create jobs, mobilize
 savings, and spread development to distant regions
 and underprivileged zones." The fields of endeavor
 are likely to include: services, tourism, land
 transportation, and, in a notable departure from the
 previous plan, subcontracting in metal working,
 chemical products.

 mechanical engineering, electrical and electronic
 industries, and industrial maintenance and repair.
 Private enterprise, however, is still prohibited from a
 role in priority areas such as petroleum.
 Despite the plan, Algeria's continued economic good
 health and liberalization efforts depend heavily on
 developments in the world oil market. Hydrocarbon
 sales account for 98 percent of Algerian export
 earnings and about half of government revenues.
 Algeria loses $260 million annually in export receipts
 for each $1 decline in oil prices at current production
 levels of 700,000 barrels per day (b/d). Moreover,
 every 100,000-b/d drop in oil exports at current prices
 costs the regime almost $1 billion. Assuming Algeria
 can continue to produce 700,000 b/d during 1986 but
 prices stabilize at $15 per barrel, Algiers would lose
 as much as $3 billion in oil earnings.
 Because Algiers continues to insist on linking its gas
 prices to official OPEC crude oil prices rather than to
 market prices, $15 per barrel oil has significant
 implications for natural gas sales. Even if Algiers can
 continue to sell the same amount of gas as in 1985,
 the country could lose more than $1 billion in gas
 earnings. Moreover, it is becoming increasingly
 unlikely that Algeria will be able to maintain current
 exports. Algiers has begun renegotiating gas contracts
 with its European customers-Belgium, France, and
 Italy-but the process is expected to be difficult and
 protracted. With gas prices falling in Europe, Algeria
 will be under considerable pressure to agree to a lower
 price to retain these customers. As matters now stand,
 Algerian gas is as much as 40 percent more costly
 than alternative Dutch, Norwegian, and Soviet
 supplies.
 In a time of reduced hydrocarbon earnings, political
 forces could also threaten private-sector expansion.
 Hardliners are likely to blame Bendjedid's economic
 reforms for any ill effects of reduced hydrocarbon
 earnings. Despite the President's considerable
 political influence, an oil-spurred economic recession
 could give his opponents the wherewithal to force him
 to step back from his efforts to liberalize the economy,
 jeopardizing fledgling private-sector development.
 Algeria's worries over the vagaries of the world oil
 market will cause it to remain keenly interested in
 furthering economic ties to Washington. The
 government has already expressed special interest in
 acquiring more US technology and expertise to help
 meet its agricultural and water resource plan goals, a
 large part of which is hoped will be private-sector led.
 Algiers also is interested in US sources of resupply for
 its Soviet-equipped armed forces, according to the US
 Embassy. If oil prices remain depressed, Algiers will
 probably press for concessional loans and will
 interpret Washington's support of US firms operating
 in Algeria as a sign of US interest in closer bilateral
 relations.
 Economic ties are not likely to set the pace for
 developing political relations between Algiers and
 Washington. Despite Algeria's less doctrinaire
 attitude, the divergence in political viewpoints
 between the two capitals on Middle Eastern issues
 will limit progress. Algiers probably will want to move
 carefully in developing bilateral ties because of what
 it views to be Washington's continuing military and
 diplomatic support for Morocco, as well as Algeria's
 own interest in maintaining ties to radical Arab
 states.
 Continued low world oil prices or a sharp drop in the
 price or amount of natural gas sold to traditional
 European customers would force Algeria to radically
 reduce development efforts or resort to heavy
 borrowing on the international market. Both are
 unpleasant options. Reducing development efforts
 threatens Algeria's ability to prepare the way for an
 economy without oil-Algiers expects to become a net
 oil importer in the 1990s. Borrowing heavily abroad is
 also unappealing because, with oil and gas as primary
 collateral, bankers are likely to exact high interest
 rates and other concessions from Algiers on any loan.

 Tunisia:
 Prospects for Privatization
 The private sector has provided substantial impetus to
 the development of Tunisia's economy. President
 Habib Bourguiba's favorable disposition toward
 private initiative has resulted in significant legislation
 and financial incentives that should continue to
 promote private-sector development. Nevertheless,
 bleak economic prospects and the political uncertainty
 generated by the impending presidential succession
 probably will slow movement toward divestiture of
 public enterprises and limit Tunisia's ability to attract
 foreign capital. In the restricted resource environment
 likely to prevail through the end of the decade,
 privatization efforts will have to be focused on
 streamlining operations of financial institutions and
 improving the efficiency of the agricultural sector.
 Moreover, the government will have to enact new
 legislation to correct imbalances in private
 development policy and to redress growing regional
 and demographic disparities.
 The Roots of Private Initiative
 Tunisia's experience under French protection from
 1881 to 1956 had a profound influence on the
 direction of its economic development as an
 independent state. France left the country's natural
 and human resources almost wholly unintegrated and
 dependent on foreign management. Natural resources
 were exploited to serve the French economy. Most
 foreign residents were merchants or administrators
 who were not interested in training a cadre of
 Tunisian industrialists or entrepreneurs. At
 independence only 50,000 Tunisians were employed in
 domestic manufacturing. Moreover, education and
 training of the population were not priorities during
 the protectorate; 75 percent of Tunisians were
 illiterate in 1956. Unlike neighboring Algeria, the
 French withdrawal proceeded relatively peacefully
 over several years, allowing continued access to the
 French economy and an opportunity for Tunisian
 President Habib Bourguiba to implement moderate
 The state served as Tunisia's principal economic
 engine from independence through the late 1960s.
 Beginning in 1962, then economic czar Ahmed Ben
 Salah attempted to redress the lack of private capital
 and entrepreneurial talent by collectivizing Tunisian
 agriculture and industry. By 1969 the financial losses
 of the cooperative experiment became unsustainable,
 and Tunisia's state socialist experiment ended, despite
 its significant development of basic infrastructure and
 industry. President Bourguiba replaced Ben Salah
 with a new team of politicians sympathetic to Western
 economic policies and a free-market approach to
 development.
 Since 1970 the government has encouraged existing
 private economic activity and the establishment of
 new private enterprise. Significant enactments in
 1972, 1976, 1978, 1981, and 1984 opened the way for
 financial incentives for foreign investment in export-
 oriented sectors and the agricultural sector.
 Liberalized trade policies also have helped stimulate
 greater private participation in the economy. The
 work force is one of the best educated in Africa. F_
 The stability of political leadership under Habib
 Bourguiba and his favorable disposition toward
 private enterprise and the West have reduced
 economic uncertainty and given continuity to the
 country's economic development. The selection in
 1980 of Mohamed Mzali-a liberal on economic
 policy-as Prime Minister and heir apparent to
 Bourguiba underscores the regime's commitment to
 private development.
 Public Versus Private Development
 Since independence, the public sector has been an
 important part of Tunisia's economy. The government

 and banking), too costly for private ownership (steel,
 hydrocarbon, and phosphate production), crucial for
 national development (tourism in the 1970s), or
 essential to maintaining regular supplies (cereal
 distribution). These enterprises produce 25 percent of
 the country's GDP, employ 35 percent of the
 population, and pay 38 percent of wages. They
 account for 75 percent of exports and 45 percent of
 imports and absorb 40 percent of total investment.
 Nevertheless, the public sector in Tunisia has long
 been characterized by inefficiency, poor productivity,
 and corruption.
 The government's promotion of private enterprise has
 paid handsome dividends. Private economic activity
 was the engine behind rapid economic growth during
 the 1970s, averaging 7.3 percent during the decade
 compared with 6.7 percent in neighboring Algeria.
 Cereal production almost tripled during this period as
 farmland was returned to private ownership.
 Moreover, between 1973 and 1980 almost 600 foreign
 firms established factories under Tunisia's revised
 investment laws, creating 90,000 positions in light
 manufacturing and supplying $1.6 billion in private
 investment. Tunisia's private sector-including
 agriculture-employs 50 percent of the population
 and accounts for 75 percent of GDP.
 The growing financial burden of public enterprises on
 state resources-$425 million in subventions last
 year-is pushing Tunis to reform the sector.
 Legislation enacted last year specifies that firms with
 state ownership exceeding 34 percent will remain in
 the public domain and eligible for public subsidies.
 The government will reexamine all public firms by the
 end of this year and will increase its equity share to
 34 percent in those firms that will remain in the
 public sector. Other firms will be sold or liquidated
 and the proceeds used to improve efficiency in the
 remaining state enterprises. This measure could cut to
 300 the number of public-sector firms.
 A major intent of the new law is to shift state
 investment away from nonstrategic concerns. Tunis
 defines nonstrategic sectors as those in which
 resources are adequate or expanding, in which private
 competition is healthy, and which are well
 developed-tourism and agricultural equipment
 distribution, for example. Strategic sectors targeted
 for continued state control are either those that
 provide essential public services or, in the case of
 hydrocarbons, are a major source of foreign exchange.
 In practice, the reforms will do little to develop
 private enterprise. The US Embassy in Tunis says the
 reforms are an effort to get development banks from
 the Gulf states and other private investors to assume
 the role of the state in financing selected public
 enterprises. The new owners will not be allowed to
 determine levels of employment and must agree to
 maintain existing management policies as a condition
 of ownership. Since the intent is to shift sources of
 funding rather than policies, little change can be
 expected in the efficiency or profitability of the new
 "private" concerns.
 Obstacles to Privatization
 Tunisia's efforts to enhance private participation in
 the economy have created at least three major
 problems. The structure of industrialization under the
 private capital investment laws has been unbalanced,
 and no mechanism has been established to correct the
 overconcentration of capital in some sectors such as
 the textile industry. Moreover, privatization policies
 have tended to skew Tunisia's industrialization policy
 toward an overdependence on a narrow spectrum of
 exports targeted at the European market. Finally,
 legislation has adversely affected the location of new
 production facilities, increasing the concentration of
 industry and population in coastal areas to the
 detriment of the interior.
 Tunisia's bleak economic prospects will hinder
 progress on correcting these economic imbalances.
 Textile and agricultural exports-34 percent of
 foreign exchange receipts-are facing stiffer quotas in
 Europe. Demand for Tunisian phosphates-20
 percent of exports-also is weak. Tourism has ceased
 to be a source of growth because the industry is
 reaching maturity, and worker remittances are down
 because of the expulsion of Tunisian expatriates from
 Libya.

 Secret
 More ominous is the slide in world oil prices. The US
 Embassy in Tunis estimates that $20 per barrel oil
 will increase this year's budget deficit by 10 percent,
 trim 2 percentage points off GDP growth, and
 increase the current account deficit by $70 million. A
 $15 per barrel average price would almost double the
 impact. Available domestic resources almost certainly
 will have to be used to finance urgent social programs
 instead of private-sector development. An already
 troubling debt service burden-a projected 25 percent
 of goods and services exports this year-probably will
 preclude substantial foreign borrowing.
 Tunisia's powerful labor movement also is an
 impediment to further privatization. For example,
 union leadership already has stated its opposition to
 plans to return the national transportation company to
 the private sector by the end of 1986. The US
 Embassy in Tunis says the six union-affiliated
 deputies in the National Assembly voted against
 public-sector reforms last year, fearing the legislation
 would subordinate worker rights to capitalist
 interests. Moreover, labor and government are on a
 collision course over wages-frozen since March
 1983-and productivity issues. Trimming public
 enterprises will be particularly difficult with urban
 unemployment already at 25 percent and 65,000 new
 positions needed annually to accommodate new, well-
 educated entrants to the labor force.
 confidence in Tunisia is eroding, and the leadership
 lacks the will to move forward with economic
 liberalization. Politicians-including the Prime
 Minister-are increasingly jockeying for position in
 the post-Bourguiba era while the President's
 faculties are less focused on economic policy. We
 expect that the government will defer major action on
 privatization until after the President passes from
 power.
 Outlook
 To please both investors looking for profits and
 entrenched officials with vested interests in the
 patronage system, the government has embarked on a
 system of reforms unlikely to please anyone. The poor
 economic prospects for the near term will, at a
 minimum, slow the government's ability to proceed
 with public enterprise reform. Nevertheless, the new
 laws provide a legal framework within which a
 successor government can begin true privatization.
 Prime Minister Mzali probably will continue
 Bourguiba's efforts to pull the government out of
 more segments of the economy if he can consolidate
 his position after the President leaves office. In the
 meantime, the government will continue to seek badly
 needed financial breathing room by cajoling other
 investors to assume a larger portion of the economic

 The established patronage system will be difficult to
 overcome. Tunisia's economic experiments have had
 the effect of consolidating economic power in the
 hands of a narrowing spectrum of the population,
 especially in bourgeois groups who have obtained
 political influence and wealth through the ruling
 party and their positions in public enterprises. For
 example, the US Embassy says that managers of a
 stadium project in Bizerte were accused of embezzling
 $560,000 from the project. Swift intervention by the
 managers' patron resulted in their acquittal. This shift
 is visible in World Bank statistics, which show that
 the poorest 20 percent of the population accounted for
 6 percent of total consumption in 1966 and 5 percent
 in 1980. In contrast the share of the richest 5 percent
 rose from 18 percent in 1966 to 22 percent in 1980.
 burden.
 A number of options are available to the Tunisian
 Government that could accelerate the process of
 private involvement in the economy. The US Embassy
 in Tunis is promoting joint ventures and trade
 between US and Tunisian partners and provides local
 businessmen with information designed to improve
 their competitive position in world markets.
 Increasing the efficiency of the financial system as
 well as rationalizing agricultural production and
 distribution systems probably would have the greatest
 impact and meet with the least amount of opposition.
 Promotion of additional trade regulation and tax
 policy reform would help to rationalize the
 privatization effort and redress imbalances caused by
 privatization incentives.

 Pakistan:
 Privatization in Question
 We do not expect privatization in Pakistan to pick up
 much from its current slow pace. We believe that
 some of the country's new civilian leaders will be
 reluctant to antagonize the trade unions or forgo the
 patronage opportunities associated with economic
 controls and management of large-scale public
 enterprises. Although the new civilian government has
 promised to continue denationalization, the dismissal
 of its key proponent, Dr. Mahbubul Haq, from the
 Finance Ministry is a bad omen. Pakistan is likely to
 only partly divest some key industries. Foreign
 participation will be limited, given Pakistan's political
 history and tenuous location. The perennial money-
 losers will remain a burden on the government.
 Back and Forth
 Since independence in 1947, Pakistan's economic
 policies have vacillated between support for the
 private or public sectors. During the civilian and
 martial law administrations of the 1950s and 1960s,
 capital-intensive and large-scale private investment
 was promoted. These policies were reversed by the
 Bhutto administration (1971-77), which increased
 economic controls on the private sector and instituted
 a wide-ranging nationalization of Pakistani industry,
 banking, and insurance.
 With the return to martial law in 1977, the Zia
 administration reduced government investment in
 public-sector industries, liberalized some imports,
 eased regulations impeding private investment, and
 attempted-with limited success-to privatize public-
 sector industries. In our view, Islamabad was
 successful with "easy" targets such as small-scale rice
 husking plants, cotton-ginning facilities, and flour
 mills that had few liabilities, required little new
 investment, and had been previously owned by private
 entrepreneurs. Privatization, however, soon stalled
 because many former owners refused to reclaim
 unprofitable operations, and the government was
 reluctant to provoke trade union opposition.
 Measured Moves Toward Privatization
 This year's budget-drafted by former Finance
 Minister Mahbubul Haq-outlined a renewed effort
 to liberalize Pakistan's control-laden economy.
 According to press reports, Islamabad promised to
 reduce onerous regulations and formulate plans to
 partly divest government-controlled banking, energy,
 transport, and manufacturing operations.
 In our view, Pakistan's renewed interest in
 privatization stems more from budgetary and
 financial strains than from ideological commitment.
 Since FY 1978,' Pakistan's deficit has increased-in
 real terms-more than tenfold as a percentage of
 GDP, and a deteriorating foreign payments situation
 last summer caused reserves to fall to less than $325
 million-equivalent to the value of about three weeks'
 imports-limiting funds available for imported
 equipment and raw materials. Prospects for increased
 concessional aid over the next few years are not
 bright, forcing Islamabad to take a hard look at
 money-losing public-sector firms and to consider
 selling stock in profitable firms to raise cash.
 Public-sector firms play a key role in Pakistan's
 economy because they dominate energy, transport,
 banking and insurance, and large-scale industries-
 steel, cement, and chemicals. Some of these firms are
 losing money even with generous subsidies, cheap
 bank credit, and other transfer payments. In FY 1984
 total pretax public-sector "profits" accounted for less
 than half of the subsidy on fertilizer production alone,
 according to official statistics. Even the well-managed
 public-sector entities, such as Pakistan International
 Airlines (PIA), are strapped for cash, according to
 Embassy and official reports.

 Secret
 The civilian government, which came to power last
 December, proposed to partly divest public-sector
 enterprises ranging from the airlines and oil
 production to cement and government-run textile
 mills. The first offer of over $100 million in shares
 includes firms like PIA and the State Oil Corporation,
 which are being sold at 30 percent below market
 rates. The second offer, however, includes an
 unpalatable selection of 12 money-losing enterprises.
 Some of these firms are not even functioning-one
 has been closed for five years, according to Embassy
 reporting.
 Economic and Political Impediments
 Pakistani investors are being very cautious toward the
 divestiture program. Initial stock market reaction was
 negative, with public-sector stocks taking a beating,
 according to press reports. Public company stocks
 only recovered when local investors learned that most
 shares will be sold to expatriates. Some investors are
 concerned that partial divestiture-Islamabad is
 willing to sell a maximum of 49 percent of the
 shares-will still allow government control, increasing
 the potential for mismanagement and losses. Investors
 are also disturbed over unclear regulations that may
 force them to assume the liabilities of public-sector
 firms in which they purchase shares. In addition,
 Islamabad has indicated that new owners will not be
 able to reduce union-dominated and bloated work
 forces, according to US Embassy reporting.
 Moreover, Pakistan's weak capital market may be
 unable to absorb the proposed divestiture. Although
 the government raised more than $1 billion-much of
 it borrowed from banks-from special bond schemes
 last year, these actions probably have drained much of
 the available private capital. One Pakistani analyst
 notes that the Karachi Stock Exchange, the country's
 largest, could raise only an estimated $24 million in
 its peak year of FY 1984.
 An informal alliance of Pakistani bureaucrats,
 politicians, and trade union leaders is likely to impede
 progress on divestiture. The recent dismissal of
 Mahbubul Haq from the Finance Ministry suggests
 that his archrival Ghulam Ishaq Khan-a longtime
 opponent to privatization-is likely to play a more
 prominent role in economic policy making. We believe
 that some of the new civilian leaders will be reluctant
 to forgo the patronage opportunities associated with
 economic controls and management of large-scale
 public enterprises. In addition, we judge that the
 Junejo administration will be particularly sensitive to
 trade union demands to protect workers, adding
 another disincentive to increased private investment.
 Prospects for Foreign Investment
 Islamabad's efforts at divestiture will probably offer
 few opportunities for increased foreign investment.
 Islamabad is considering selling PIA shares on the
 New York Stock Exchange, but most shares in other
 companies are reserved for Pakistani expatriates or
 citizens, according to US Embassy reports. Although
 the government has publicly welcomed outside
 investment, direct foreign investment has always been
 small, averaging only $60 million a year since FY
 1978.
 Pakistan's history of political instability, its tenuous
 location, and foreign exchange problems make it
 unattractive to most foreign investors. Last year,
 international bankers raised commercial loan rates to
 Pakistan because of its shaky foreign exchange
 position. Foreign investors have often complained
 about the country's excessive bureaucratic delays and
 inadequate economic infrastructure which lower
 productivity, raise costs, and complicate business
 transactions, according to Embassy reports.
 Government policies also discriminate against foreign
 investment by restricting imports and increasing
 domestic content requirements.
 Outlook
 We expect bureaucratic, political, and economic
 constraints to slow the pace of privatization in
 Pakistan. With the removal of Mahbubul Haq, there
 will be little impetus to push economic change. The
 new civilian government is especially sensitive to
 domestic political concerns and is likely to back away
 from privatization if opposition arises.
 Moreover, only a few well-managed and profitable
 firms are likely to attract investors. Islamabad still
 will have to subsidize the money-losers-the ones it

 Pakistan's weak capital market and uncertainty over

 The Private Sector in Egypt:
 Clouded Horizon
 Despite rhetoric proclaiming Cairo's commitment to
 expansion of the private sector, progress in recent
 years has been slow. The growing economic crisis
 enveloping Egypt will probably jeopardize future
 private development efforts by forcing the regime to
 abandon its limited support for private initiatives and
 instead, concentrate on preserving domestic order.
 Moreover, we doubt that in an atmosphere of
 economic austerity and political instability private
 entrepreneurs would be willing to accept the
 heightened financial risks that accompany a larger
 role in the economy. Only a major shift in government
 and public perceptions would encourage greater
 privatization at this time. Given current social and
 economic trends in Egypt, the prospects for such a
 shift are poor.
 The Private Sector in Egypt
 The role and extent of the private sector in Egypt are
 significant. Since President Sadat broke with the
 Nasir policy of pervasive state control and proclaimed
 the "open door" policy in 1974, the private-sector's
 share in Egypt's industrial output has grown from just
 over 20 percent to one-third. The private sector
 generates over 60 percent of GDP when the
 agricultural and service sectors are added. In
 addition, the banking system, once dominated by four
 nationalized Egyptian banks, has become more
 competitive as dozens of private Egyptian banks, joint
 ventures, and foreign branches have been established.
 Although the private sector has undergone important
 development, it is circumscribed by government
 controls. A prime example is the agricultural sector,
 which, although predominantly in private hands, is
 manipulated by the government through regulation of
 input and output prices. In the past few years, slow
 adjustments in producer prices combined with rapid
 increases in farm costs have not only discouraged
 production but also shifted it in favor of certain crops
 (for example, clover and corn) which the country
 should not be emphasizing. Producer prices for most
 major crops have been set at relatively low levels to
 provide low-cost inputs to domestic industry and
 inexpensive food to urban dwellers.
 Procurement prices have been considerably revised
 during the past year, but state control over the pricing
 mechanism remains intact.' For most crops,
 procurement prices continue to be determined by the
 Ministry of Agriculture in conjunction with other
 ministries. In all cases decisions are reviewed by the
 Cabinet Higher Economic Policy Committee. The
 multiplicity of decisionmakers as well as the heavily
 politicized nature of the decisionmaking process
 ensure frequent delays in price adjustments and
 continued turmoil in the agricultural sector.
 Nowhere is the stamp of government control more
 heavily felt nor the need for privatization greater than
 in the industrial sector. Fully two-thirds of industrial
 production originates from public-sector companies
 under the supervision of the Ministry of Industry and
 several other ministries. The nationalizations of the
 1950s and 1960s brought most industries, including
 all heavy industry, under government ownership and
 management. Despite the adoption of the "open door"
 policies of the early 1970s, public-sector companies
 remain dominant in most industrial categories
 including textiles, food processing, engineering, and
 chemicals.
 Public-sector companies involved in manufacturing
 have, in recent years, suffered from lagging
 productivity and sagging exports. The average
 compensation per worker, for example, was 12.8
 percent higher in the first half of 1983-84 than in the
 first half of 1982-83, while the nominal value of
 output per worker increased by 10.6 percent during
 the same period. Despite wage boosts, government pay
 rates are low compared with wages offered in the
 private sector and abroad, with the result that it has
 become increasingly difficult for the public sector to
 retain skilled labor.
 ' The price the government pays to producers of cotton, rice, sugar
 cane, and wheat were increased by 20 to 30 percent during the
 fiscal year ending June 1985. Nevertheless, with the possible
 exception of wheat, prices paid to farmers are below international
 levels and provide little incentive to expand production.

 Secret
 The relatively poor export performance of public-
 sector companies is largely attributable to inefficiency
 and the domestic orientation of these firms,
 tendencies that government policies do little to
 discourage. Trade barriers in the form of quotas in
 many industrial countries have also played a role, but
 poor quality control, noncompetitive pricing, and the
 priority assigned by the government to producing for
 the domestic market are the primary reasons for
 sluggish export growth. To a large extent, the
 industrial public sector has been used by the Egyptian
 Government to restrain the rate of inflation by
 limiting price increases for the numerous consumer
 goods this sector produces. In the process of
 contributing to domestic political order, the financial
 status of public-sector companies has been severely
 weakened, and, as a whole, they have become a net
 foreign exchange drain to the economy.
 Recently, the Deputy Prime Minister suggested that
 the government is exploring the possibility of selling
 the public-sector shares of joint public-private
 ventures. Although this is unlikely to result in a
 substantial divestiture of government holdings, it is
 significant as the first indication of government
 willingness to consider privatization.
 Recent Developments
 Government policy proclamations urging new private
 initiatives suggest, at least superficially, that the
 climate for private-sector growth is excellent.
 Nonetheless, among many private business
 representatives there is a growing disquiet. The
 chronic foreign exchange shortage facing Egypt, in all
 likelihood, will continue to worsen, with an increasing
 disparity between free market and government-
 controlled rates. A strong possibility exists that the
 regime will attempt to tighten control of the private
 foreign exchange market to funnel more hard
 currency into government coffers. Such a policy was
 attempted in January 1985 with disastrous results for
 the private sector, which was starved for funds until
 the policy was revised four months later.
 Although it would appear unlikely that Cairo would
 reintroduce policy initiatives so recently proved
 unsuccessful, the widening economic crisis may
 persuade the regime to adopt a variant of the 1985
 program with equally negative consequences for the
 private sector. Moreover, even without new foreign
 exchange regulations, the growing shortage of hard
 currency will force government agencies to turn to the
 free market to obtain their foreign exchange
 requirements. This will drive free market rates ever
 higher and crowd out private-sector borrowers.
 The government's commitment to the private sector is
 being questioned within business circles for other
 reasons as well. Policies currently in effect or
 proposed give many private investors the impression
 of bias in favor of the public sector. For example,
 except in cement/brick production where price
 equalization was recently accomplished, private
 foreign investors pay world market prices for energy
 but must compete with public-sector companies that
 acquire energy at heavily subsidized domestic prices.
 Moreover, in the current five-year plan-the primary
 development document of the government-public-
 sector investment remains programed at 77 percent of
 the economy's total. Finally, recently proposed
 changes in the tariff structure would raise rates on
 goods deemed nonessential by the government. The
 impact on private-sector imports is unclear, but many
 observers recall that, in the past, public-sector imports
 have received priority. It is the combination of these
 factors together with continued bureaucratic obstacles
 that send the wrong signal to investors and cast doubt
 on the government's sincerity about promoting the
 private sector.
 Storm Clouds Ahead
 As mixed as the outlook for private-sector initiatives
 has been, the immediate future appears even more
 grim. Egypt is entering a period of economic stress as
 a result of sharply declining oil prices, lagging growth
 caused by inappropriate economic policies, and
 increasing political discontent with the Mubarak
 regime. Major shifts in economic policy, whether self-
 initiated or formalized in an IMF-supported standby
 program, will be required to weather the growing
 crisis.

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/01/09: CIA-RDP87T00289R000200820001-7
 In this situation, where the population as a whole will
 be required to accept greater austerity, it will become
 more difficult to justify the perceived special benefits
 and privileges enjoyed by wealthy businessmen.
 Moreover, the strong social consensus in Egypt that
 holds the state responsible for the welfare of the
 population will, in a period of economic retrenchment,
 demand government solutions and government
 initiatives for the middle and lower classes. It will be
 politically unwise for the regime to pursue policies
 such as privatization that appear to contribute to the
 further enrichment of already wealthy entrepreneurs.
 Businessmen themselves are unlikely to risk capital in
 an environment of economic and political uncertainty,
 particularly in the absence of strong new initiatives by
 the Mubarak regime to encourage private-sector
 development. There are few signs that the regime is
 preparing bold policy moves in this regard and
 abundant indications that the current drift in
 economic policy will worsen the climate for private-
 sector growth. The government has exhibited only a
 shallow commitment to private development,
 suggesting that much of its rhetoric, including
 proposals for privatization, is window dressing
 designed to beguile US interests.

 Syria: Trying To Tap
 the Private Sector
 The Syrian economy is a socialist one, and it will
 remain so for the near term. The government owns all
 large industrial and extractive enterprises and
 controls most of the country's foreign trade. The poor
 state of the economy and a severe shortage of foreign
 exchange are forcing the government to undertake
 economic reforms and to seek ways of tapping the
 wealth and expertise of the private sector. This effort
 is being pushed primarily by one man, Minister of
 Economy and Foreign Trade Muhammad al-Imadi.
 Imadi appears to have the backing of President Assad
 for his efforts, but he faces serious opposition from
 entrenched leftist ideologues in the Bath Party, from
 a recalcitrant bureaucracy, and from public-sector
 managers who have vested interests in maintaining
 the status quo.
 Privatization, in any real sense, is unlikely to occur in
 Syria under the present regime. Private investors may
 be allowed to have capital participation-up to 70 to
 75 percent in some cases-in selected areas such as
 tourism and agriculture. This has already happened in
 some instances in tourist ventures. Arab and
 expatriate Syrian investors may also participate to a
 limited extent. It is unlikely, however, that Syria's
 dismal economic situation will force the government
 to privatize the large public enterprises to a
 meaningful degree or allow their control to slip from
 the government's hands.
 The Road to Socialism
 Before 1958, Syria had a long tradition of private
 enterprise and free market economic activity. The role
 of the state was limited to nonprofit services and
 infrastructure development. It owned and operated
 public utilities and transportation services including
 the railroads and airlines. When Syria joined Egypt in
 the United Arab Republic in 1958, the governing
 economic philosophy shifted toward socialism. Under
 President Nasir's decrees of July 1961, banks,
 insurance companies, and several industrial firms
 were nationalized. These measures were largely
 reversed following the breakup of the republic in
 This economic liberalization ended abruptly with the
 Bath military coup of March 1963. By the middle of
 1965, the government controlled all banking and
 insurance companies, most of the industrial and
 transportation sectors, the energy sector, and over
 75 percent of foreign trade. Although nationalization
 had largely ended by late 1965, the importance of the
 public sector continued to grow as most government
 investment was channeled into state-owned
 enterprises, as private capital fled, and as the private
 sector was hamstrung by government regulation.
 Currently, the government and the public sector
 employ about 43 percent of the labor force. Public-
 sector enterprises account for almost three-fourths of
 the output of the industrial sector and control almost
 90 percent of import and export trade. They also
 produce about 70 percent of Syria's GDP. In 1983,
 public enterprises accounted for two-thirds of the
 fixed capital formation in the country.
 The Private Sector in Syria
 The private sector plays its most important economic
 role in agriculture, where most production is still in
 private hands. In the last 15 years there has been
 some de facto, though illegal, combination of plots
 into more economically viable units. Although
 production remains in private hands, the government
 plays a large part in the provision of agricultural
 inputs and the purchasing of agricultural output.
 Other areas of private-sector activity include real
 estate, tourism, textiles, food processing, and
 engineering. In general, private investors feel safe so
 long as their businesses are small enough not to
 attract government attention. There are no capital
 markets in Syria, and foreign exchange trading
 outside the banking system is illegal.

 Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade
 Muhammad al-Imadi
 Minister Imadi, a 55-year-old Sunni Muslim, was
 born in Damascus. He was educated at Damascus
 University and New York University, receiving a
 doctoral degree in economics in 1960. He has held
 several economic positions in the Syrian Government,
 including that of Minister of Economy and Foreign
 Trade from 1972 to 1979. In April 1979 he accepted
 an appointment as head of the Kuwait-based Arab
 Fund for Economic and Social Development. Imadi
 returned to the position of Minister of Economy and
 Foreign Trade in July 1985 at President Assad's
 urging. He is described as a highly respected
 economist/technocrat known for his laissez faire
 philosophy and his pragmatic approach. He is well
 liked by the Syrian business community.
 Reform Moves
 Syria's leading economic reformist, Minister Imadi,
 took office in July 1985 and, according to the US
 Embassy, quickly initiated studies on:
 ? Stimulating investment and production by
 subjecting public-sector companies to greater
 competition.
 ? Encouraging private investment in a broader range
 of mixed public-private ventures and even in purely
 private enterprises.
 ? Reform of the highly artificial exchange rate for the
 Syrian pound.
 ? Reduction of the large-up to 110 percent-deposit
 required for foreign exchange letters of credit to pay
 for imports.
 Imadi to date has helped implement several reforms,
 including a cut in the government subsidy of certain
 commodities by raising prices of fuels from 25 to
 75 percent and by raising prices of sugar, tea, and
 cigarettes by 33 to 100 percent. At the same time, the
 government increased-by lesser amounts-civil
 servant wages and retiree benefits and increased fuel
 allowances for government employees.
 The government has also reduced the deposit required
 of private firms for imports of capital goods from
 110 percent of their value to 50 percent. Decrees
 liberalizing private-sector imports of raw materials,
 spare parts, and agricultural commodities have been
 issued. Exporters and returning Syrian emigrants may
 now set up special foreign exchange accounts that can
 be used, with certain restrictions, to pay for imports.
 Lastly, the highly overvalued Syrian pound has been
 devalued for a few types of transactions.
 In its biggest move to date
 the Syrian Government has
 circulated a proposed four-year economic reform that
 substantially expands the role of the private sector in
 the economy. The plan, approved by President Assad
 and the Cabinet, calls for:
 ? The duty-free import of all goods by the private
 sector.
 ? Private-sector manufacturing in any sector of the
 economy.
 ? Private-sector investment in and joint business deals
 with public-sector companies.
 ? Private-sector import of foreign currency without
 restrictions.
 ? The encouragement of Arab and expatriate Syrian
 investment in Syria.
 ? Central bank guarantees of foreign investment in
 the private sector.
 So far, foreign investment and joint private-public
 ventures have mainly occurred in agriculture and the
 tourist industry, where some hotels have been built. If
 the reforms take hold and investors can be found, new
 projects will probably involve 25-percent government
 ownership, with not more than 25 percent owned by
 foreigners.
 Outlook
 Syria has tried several times in the last two decades to
 attract foreign investment with little success. It is
 unlikely to succeed to any extent in the future unless
 significant reform of the Syrian economy is
 implemented. Imadi also faces serious opposition to
 economic reform in general and may not be able to
 push his initiatives far enough to make a difference.
 The severe crackdown on illegal moneychangers and
 smuggling, which occurred in late January, can be
 seen as a setback to Imadi's efforts. This move would

 seem to have gone against his philosophy and may
 have been, in part, an effort by Prime Minister Kasm
 and other ideologues to discredit Imadi and economic
 liberalism in general.
 Kasm and other Ba'thist leaders believe socialism is
 one of the cornerstones of the party's ideology, along
 with pan-Arabism. The party leadership believes the
 private sector, especially the merchant communities
 of Damascus and Aleppo, are reluctant Ba'thists at
 best. The Ba'th's junior partners in the ruling
 National Progressive Front, especially the Syrian
 Communist Party, are also traditionally suspicious of
 the private sector and likely to strongly resist
 privatization.
 Minister Imadi's initiatives face an uphill battle.
 President Assad, who generally has only a passing
 interest in economics, is being pressed by the poor
 state of the Syrian economy to make changes. In
 addition to Ba'thist opposition, economic reform along
 Imadi's lines and reform in general will face
 opposition from a recalcitrant bureaucracy and
 entrenched public-sector managers. Real privatization
 of Syria's public enterprises probably will not occur,
 nor will the economy be turned over to the free
 market to any significant extent.

 Creeping Privatization
 BANGLADESHI ENTERPRISES CONSIDERED FOR PARTIAL PRIVATIZATION*
 *Government may sell up to 49% equity stakes
 to private investors.
 Bangladesh's new five-year plan continues to put great emphasis on privatization
 and has earmarked one-third-$4.5 billion-of its budget to private-sector
 investment, according to press reports. The government sees privatization as a
 means to reduce budgetary pressures, improve efficiency, and attract "black
 money" now in private hands into the economy. The policy shift favoring
 privatization began after the imposition of martial law in 1975 and was reflected
 in Bangladesh's new industrial policy-providing incentives to the private sector
 and opening up most sectors to domestic and foreign investment.
 Bangladesh's privatization program has found its way into many of the key sectors
 of the economy. Large parts of the jute and textile industry have been returned to
 the private sector-often to the individuals who owned them before
 nationalization. Planning for the partial divestiture of the shipping lines, national
 airline, telephone industry, and three of the four government-owned banks has
 begun. Press reports indicate that manufacturing and engineering enterprises are
 likely to be added to the list. Permission has also been granted for the
 establishment of private insurance agencies. Despite these efforts, the private
 sector lacks the funds and management expertise to take over many of the larger
 state enterprises, and foreign firms are not allowed to take over the entire equity,
 limiting their incentive.
 privatization.
 President Ershad, although committed to privatization, may have to take a
 stronger hand to move the process along. The most useful steps would be to allow
 sponsors and investors in the private sector to assume a more active role in the
 management of firms and to have reforms in prices and tariffs accompany
 divestiture. Further progress will also depend on the cooperation of the trade
 unions and public-sector managers who see their livelihoods threatened by

 A slowdown in Jordanian economic growth to 2 percent per year for the last three
 years has prompted Amman to reassess its economic strategy. A new Prime
 Minister was appointed in April 1985, in part to stimulate the economy. Financial
 limitations, however, have forced Amman to lower its goals for government
 stimulus of the economy and to move toward greater involvement of the private
 sector. We believe the overall prospects for privatization are dim, largely because
 Jordanian investors tend to avoid domestic projects in favor of more attractive

 The Telecommunications Corporation was converted in March 1986 into a public
 shareholding company, paving the way for the government to begin selling shares
 in the corporation, up to now a government monopoly. The company has 130,000
 telephone and 2,500 telex subscribers, numbers that probably will increase rapidly
 in the next few years. An extensive modernization program and expansion of
 Similarly, a privatization plan for ALIA-Jordan's international airline-was
 approved in principle in December 1985 in order to modernize and expand the
 fleet. If the plan is carried out, 10 percent of ALIA's shares will be offered for sale.
 Subsequent offerings will depend upon how well the first offering is received.
 ALIA balance sheets, however, do not suggest there will be wide acceptance of the
 share offering. Losses totaled about $26 million in 1984, and the firm only broke
 Telecommunications    Frequent Candidates for Privatization
 and Airlines
 Telecommunications and airlines are among the industries that are most
 frequently considered for privatization by Middle Eastern and South Asian
 Many telecommunications networks in the region are decades old and outmoded.
 At the same time, telecommunications needs have grown so rapidly and in so many
 new directions and technology of the industry has changed so much that
 monolithic organizations can no longer keep pace. Private enterprises have proved
 more adaptable than public ones in providing highly specialized equipment. Some
 countries of the Middle East and South Asia have joined industrialized Western
 nations such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan to diversify
 only marginally profitable and not attractive to investors.
 At least three countries in the region-Pakistan, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia-are
 privatizing their airlines as part of an effort to modernize them. We believe these
 efforts will be less successful than privatization of telecommunications. With the
 airlines, governments see privatization as a way to raise money for new equipment
 that the governments themselves cannot afford. Local financial markets, however,
 often cannot raise sufficient capital, and the airlines are often money-losers or are
