 PROSPECTS FOR SOVIET CONTROL OF A COMMUNIST CHINA *
 It is the intention of the Soviet Union to advance toward its goal of eventual world
 domination. by adding to the Soviet orbit the enormous territory and population of
 China, and by employing China to facilitate Soviet expansion into other Far Eastern
 areas.
 A coalition government formed by the Chinese Communists, while representing a
 temporary tactical maneuver, will contain no elements capable of offering real opposi-
 tion to the Communists.
 A moderate Chinese Communist policy toward small business proprietors, land-
 owners, and peasants will help to gain popular support, at least until the government
 feels strong enough to launch into the more vigorous phases of communization.
 The Communist timetable in China will be flexible and will be influenced by internal
 conditions in China generally, as well as by the international situation.  The complexi-
 ties of ruling a country like China will, undoubtedly, retard the consolidation of Com-
 munist control, but these complexities in themselves probably cannot, in the long run,
 prevent it.
 The Chinese Communists will support Soviet foreign policy by diplomatic moves
 calculated to embarrass the Western Powers, by blatant anti-Western propaganda, and
 by assistance to the Communist parties and nationalist movements of Asia.
 Foreign loans which involve no political commitments will be negotiated by the
 Chinese Communists wherever possible, and foreign trade (under state supervision)
 will undoubtedly be continued with non-Communist countries.  This policy does not
 imply permanent benevolence toward foreign business interests in China.
 The Soviet Union will attempt to use the CCP as its chief instrument to consolidate
 control over China as it has successfully used the various national Communist parties
 of Eastern Europe.  The strong influence exerted by the Soviet Union over the Chinese
 Party has been variously revealed and provides ample indication that the present lead-
 ership of the Chinese Communists identifies itself solidly with international Com-
 munism as promulgated by Moscow.  The Kremlin will endeavor to prevent possible
 cleavages in the Party leadership from jeopardizing eventual Soviet control over China.
 The present Sino-Soviet Treaty can be directed at the US and its allies, and other
 agreements may provide for a high degree of economic and military integration be-
 tween the USSR and China.  At the same time, in accordance with its strategy of
 creating on its borders easily dominated political entities, the Soviet Government will
 probably press for political autonomy in all present Chinese border areas adjacent to
 the USSR.
 Note: The intelligence organizations of the Departments of State, Army, Navy, and the Air Force
 have concurred in this report.  The information herein is as of 12 April 1949.
 * This paper discusses a pattern of developments which should become apparent prior to 1951.

 It must be emphasized that the process of consolidation of Soviet control over
 China will unquestionably encounter considerable difficulty, in view of the many poten-
 tial points of conflict between the USSR and the Chinese Communists, e.g., the issues
 of US aid, control of peripheral areas, control of assistance to Communist movements
 in other Far Eastern areas, and the subservience which Moscow will undoubtedly de-
 mand of the CCP.  While some opposition to Moscow control probably exists in the
 CCP, for such opposition to be effective the dissident groups must wrest the control
 apparatus from the pro-Moscow leadership, or that leadership itself must change its
 policy toward Moscow.  Until evidence is available that an effective opposition is de-
 veloping, it is concluded that the CCP will remain loyal to Moscow.

 PROSPECTS FOR SOVIET CONTROL OF A COMMUNIST CHINA
 1.   SOVIET INTENTIONS IN CHINA.
 Present Soviet policy is aimed at eventual world domination, to be achieved
 through the establishment of national Communist regimes controlled and directed
 from Moscow.
 Soviet intentions in China are twofold.  The first involves adding to the Soviet
 orbit the enormous territory and population of China (thereby bringing under Soviet
 control three-fourths of the Eurasian land mass) and, conversely, denying China to the
 West as a potential base of operations against the USSR.  The second embraces use of
 China as an advance base to facilitate Soviet penetration of Southeast Asia, including
 Indonesia and the Philippines; the outflanking of India-Pakistan and the strategically
 important areas of the Middle and Near East; and eventually control of the entire
 Asiatic continent and the Western Pacific.
 2.   PROSPECTS FOR CHINESE COMMUNIST CONTROL OF CHINA.
 a.  Communist-Controlled "Coalition."
 The Communists have announced that they will form a coalition government
 upon coming to power in China.  By their own definition, such a coalition government
 will be one "led by the Chinese Communist Party, the various democratic parties
 and the representatives of the various people's associations which truly represent the
 Chinese people," and will exclude all "reactionary elements."  The coalition will enable
 the CCP to claim establishment of a truly representative government for all China.
 The coalition will be Communist-controlled from the outset, which from a Marxist
 point of view, will be a "revolutionary" phase beyond that seen in those Eastern Euro-
 pean governments in which the Communist minority parties entered legally and later
 wrested control from the others.  Thus the coalition willavoid what is usually a difficult
 and dangerous step on the road to Communist dictatorship, but the CCP will still be
 faced with the problem of gaining the support of the people it claims to represent.
 b.  Chinese Communist Internal Policy.
 The internal policies of the Communist-controlled government will be deter-
 mined, not by the policies currently in force in the USSR, but by the present stage of
 development of the Chinese revolution according to orthodox Communist theory.  This
 stage, at the moment of Communist victory in the Chinese civil war, would correspond
 roughly to that represented in the Bolshevik Revolution, when in 1920 the Bolsheviks
 had defeated their enemies inside Russia.  The NEP (New Economic Policy), a tempo-
 rary tactical retreat, was aimed at conciliating the hostile elements in the Russian
 population and thereby hastening the economic reconstruction of the country.   Mao
 Tse-tung's concept of "interim capitalism," the first stage of revolution in a "colonial"
 area, has much the same ends in view.

 BONN@
 The moderate CCP policy toward small business proprietors and landowners,
 as well as the peasant class, will probably gain wide support for the Communist regime.
 While the basis for future development of Chinese industry will, in all likelihood, be
 established by the nationalization of large-scale industrial and commercial enterprises,
 'the toleration of small business by the regime at this time should win the favor of a
 large segment of the population.  Limited agricultural reforms, on the other hand,
 such as reduction of land rents and interest rates, and land distribution, will be wel-
 comed by the peasants.  Agricultural cooperatives are also likely to be a goal of the
 Communist Government.    Collectivization on the Soviet model, however, will probably
 not be attempted on a large scale for many years to come, both because of the opposition
 it would arouse among the peasants and because it is at the present time technically
 impracticable in southern China's rice-growing areas.
 A government-sponsored movement to increase the size of fields under cul-
 tivation would, nevertheless, help to create the physical conditions necessary for the
 development of collective farms.  Through preferential taxes, subsidies for cooperative
 farmers, and a system of machine-tractor stations for use of the cooperatives- alone, a
 strong trend in the direction of collectivized agriculture could be established.
 The Communist Government can be expected eventually to incorporate these
 economic aspirations in a Three- or Five-Year Plan which will lay down the blueprint
 for development in the immediate future.
 At the outset, the Communists will devote their energy toward establishing
 complete control over the central government.  (The strength of this government may,
 however, be reduced by Soviet territorial annexations in Sinkiang and Inner Mongolia,
 and by the maintenance of a special Soviet position in Manchuria.)  As control of this
 central government is consolidated in the various areas, local governments, theoretically
 exercising complete autonomy within their own territories, will be created along the
 lines of the Soviet political structure, and eventually the form, if not the name of a
 "Union of Democratic Republics" of China will be utilized.
 In addition, a constitution modeled on that of the Soviet Union will be drafted
 to provide, on paper, for freedom of speech, worship, and assembly, while guaranteeing
 local and racial autonomy, and the right to use their own languages in schools, courts,
 and other official institutions to China's minority groups.  The constitution may also
 provide for the limited nationalization of industry envisaged by Chinese Communist
 leaders as applicable in the present stage of revolution.
 The Communists, in "reorganizing" the armed forces, will eliminate those
 elements which have already proved unreliable, and devise means to detect others as
 they appear.
 The Communists also will not neglect to integrate existing Communist police
 organizations into the present Nationalist police force, attempting to improve, perhaps
 with the aid of Russian specialists, the secret police which they have formed on the
 Soviet model.
 c.       Obstacles to Communist Consolidation of Power.
 In implementing the measures outlined above, the Communist timetable will be
 flexible and will be influenced by internal conditions in China generally, as well as by

 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/03/01: CIA-RDP78-01617A003500040004-5
 the international situation.  The underdeveloped and often non-existent communica-
 tions in this vast country render most difficult any effective centralized control.  Other
 formidable obstacles to Communist consolidation of power in China are : (1) The
 problems inherent in collectivizing a small-scale agrarian economy; (2) the difficulties
 involved in superimposing state control on the present decentralized financial struc-
 ture; and (3) the cultural conservatism of the Chinese people and their stubborn
 resistance to encroachment on their innate sense of property rights.  The complexities
 of ruling a country like China will, undoubtedly, retard the consolidation of Communist
 control, but these complexities in themselves probably cannot, in the long run, prevent it.
 In accordance with the frequently expressed belief of Communist spokesmen
 that "the world is divided into two camps," Chinese Communist leaders may be expected
 to give aggressive support to the diplomacy of the "progressive-democratic countries."
 This will involve Chinese diplomatic measures calculated to advance the ends of Soviet
 foreign policy and to embarrass the Western Powers; blatant anti-Western propaganda;
 and assistance to the Communist parties and nationalist movements of Asia.
 The new government will continue to explain its actions against the Western
 Powers in terms of protecting Asia against Western (particularly US) "imperialism,"
 and of safeguarding China's territorial integrity and national sovereignty.  The Com-
 munist government will probably bring pressure to bear upon the US to withdraw its
 military forces from Tsingtao or from any future bases established on Taiwan; and, in
 time, upon Great Britain to give up Hongkong.  China will continue to assert its claim
 to Taiwan, and perhaps, to the Ryukyu Archipelago, which is presently under US
 occupation.
 b.  Foreign Trade and Assistance.
 It seems likely that foreign loans which involve no political commitments will
 be negotiated wherever possible, and foreign trade (under state supervision) will
 undoubtedly be continued.  Trade agreements with non-Communist countries will for
 the most part be calculated to procure for China petroleum, machinery, steel, manufac-
 tured goods, and other products which cannot be readily supplied by the Soviet Union.
 The USSR will seek to obtain, by means of a trade agreement with the new government,
 required amounts of such Chinese products useful to it as tin, antimony, and tungsten,
 supplying (or promising to supply) in return Soviet manufactured goods and possibly
 agricultural products.  In addition to these direct economic advantages for itself, the
 USSR will endeavor to make use of Chinese trade and the resources of Manchuria to
 exert political pressure upon Japan and the countries of Southeast Asia.
 The Communists have given some indication that they would like foreigners
 to continue "business as usual."  This seems to be a move calculated to win easier
 recognition for their government and minimize foreign opposition to the change of
 regime. Such a policy recognizes the transitional contribution that foreign interests

 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/03/01: CIA-RDP78-01617AO03500040004-5
 can make to economic and social stability; it does not imply permanent benevolence
 toward foreign business interests in China.
 4.  SOVIET RELATIONS WITH THE CHINESE COMMUNISTS.
 a.  The CCP as a Soviet Instrument.
 The Soviet Union will attempt to use the CCP as the chief instrument to extend
 its control over China as it has successfully used various national Communist parties of
 Eastern Europe.  While the basic techniques for the extension of Soviet control
 will be drawn from the experience gained in Eastern Europe, these techniques will be
 adapted to the peculiarities of China: its vast size as compared with the countries of
 Eastern Europe, the absence of Soviet military occupation except in parts of Manchuria,
 and the lack of ethnic and cultural bonds with the Soviet Union.  In addition, Stalin
 will be mindful of the unfortunate results of Moscow's attempt to direct developments
 in China during the 1920's.
 b.  Solidarity of Chinese Communists with Moscow.
 Coming at a time when it would appear to the advantage of the Chinese Com-
 munists to profess some degree of independence, the constant profession by the leaders
 of the Chinese Communist Party of their place in the world Communist movement and
 reiteration of the absolute primacy of the Soviet Union in this movement, is ample indi-
 cation that the present leadership of the Chinese Communists identifies itself solidly
 with international Communism as promulgated by Moscow.
 The Chinese Communists have not deviated in any way from the Soviet
 line on international affairs, as was strikingly demonstrated, for example, in their
 endorsement of the Cominform condemnation of Tito.  Whether this action was the
 result of Soviet pressure or of the ideological affinity of the CCP to the world Communist
 cause, it revealed the powerful influence exerted by the Soviet Union over the Chinese
 Party.  By this action, furthermore, the CCP Central Committee was condemning a
 tendency toward national independence which many of its members might previously
 have thought compatible with the international Communist movement and certainly
 applicable to their own country.
 Later, Mao Tse-tung, in commemorating the 31st anniversary of the Bolshevik
 revolution, called on the "revolutionary forces" throughout the world to unite behind
 the Soviet Union against "American imperialism."  A more recent revelation of the
 strong pro-Soviet orientation of the Chinese Communists was the series of articles by
 Liu Shao-chi, Deputy Chairman of the CCP Politburo, reconciling nationalism and
 "proletarian internationalism."  The author clearly announced that the Chinese
 Communist Party is committed to a positive pro-Soviet line.  "Neutrality," he said,
 "is impossible.  If you do not stand in the imperialist camp helping American impe-
 rialism and its stooges to enslave the world and your own nation, you must stand in the
 anti-imperialist camp....
 c.  Soviet Liaison with CCP.
 The Soviet Union in its relations with the Chinese Communists has, in the
 past, been most circumspect.  It may be assumed that Soviet-CCP liaison exists, and
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/03/01: CIA-RDP78-01617AO03500040004-5
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/03/01: CIA-RDP78-01617AO03500040004-5
 it has been frequently claimed by the Chinese Nationalist Government and others that
 military and political advice is given to the Chinese Communist leaders by Russians.
 However, there is no positive evidence to substantiate these claims.  The proximity to
 the USSR of Chinese Communists in North China and Manchuria would make liaison
 easy and concealment of such liaison effective.  Furthermore, it is a basic practice of
 the Kremlin carefully to hide its connections with foreign Communists until their
 accession to power.
 The consolidation of Communist control in China during the first phase will
 probably be influenced by Soviet representatives operating unobtrusively under the
 cover of diplomatic, technical, commercial, or military missions.  Undoubtedly, addi-
 tional Russian diplomatic and consular officers, as well as cultural and newspaper
 representatives, will be sent to China soon after the Communist accession to power.
 These people will be charged with keeping a watchful eye on the activities of the
 Chinese Communists.  As a recent Pravda article pointed out: "The experience of the
 Communist Party of the Soviet Union is basically, fundamentally, and essentially
 acceptable to, and compulsory for, the Communist parties of all lands that are fighting
 for a socialist revolution or have launched upon the building of socialism."
 d.  Chinese Communist Leadership.
 Almost half of the present members of the CCP Central Committee and the
 Political Bureau have had training in Moscow, and many other members have received
 indoctrination through the French Communist Party.  Although training in Moscow
 or Paris is no guarantee of fidelity, such training is regarded by the Kremlin as one
 of the most important factors in developing the loyalty and discipline of non-Soviet
 Communists.
 e.   Soviet Methods to Effect Compliance of CCP.
 The Soviet Union and those Communist leaders whose loyalty to the Kremlin
 is unquestioned are well aware of the danger of cleavages in the Party leadership and
 will endeavor to prevent the development of any movement which might jeopardize the
 Soviet effort to establish control over China.
 A tested tactic employed by the USSR in maintaining control over local parties
 is the establishment of a system of checks and balances within the party leadership
 through pitting one personality against another.  Although it has been claimed that
 the relationship between Mao Tse-tung and Li Li-san might lend itself to such a
 technique, at present evidence is lacking either that Li's standing in the Party, or his
 actual power in Manchuria, is sufficient to be an effective check on Mao.  It is likely
 that the principle of checks and balances is operating within the CCP, but its applica-
 tion to specific figures is unknown.
 f.   Soviet-Chinese Mutual Assistance Pacts.
 The Soviet Union will continue to include China in its existing system of
 mutual assistance pacts with countries bordering on the Soviet Union.      The Sino-
 Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, signed in August 1945, provides that both the
 USSR and China will "undertake . . . jointly all measures in their power to render

 SWAR"T
 impossible a repetition of aggression . . . by Japan."  Thus, the Treaty can be aimed
 at the US and its allies, while ostensibly intended for a former enemy.  Additional
 agreements will probably call for "close collaboration in the interests of peace" and
 the "strengthening of economic and cultural ties," and may provide for a high degree of
 economic and military integration between the two countries, including the dispatch
 of military and technical "advisers" to China, the construction, reconstruction, and
 equipping of airfields in Chinese territory, and the formation of Soviet-Chinese stock
 companies for the development of industrial and mineral resources, especially those
 which contribute directly to the Soviet military potential.
 Similar pacts have been concluded by the Soviet Union with the "Mongolian
 People's Republic" and the "Democratic People's Republic" of Northern Korea.  An
 interlocking series of bilateral agreements among the Far Eastern "republics" may also
 be negotiated.
 g.      Political Control of Peripheral Areas.
 The Soviet Government will probably press for political autonomy of all present
 Chinese border areas adjacent to the USSR.  Such an arrangement might open the way
 for eventual Soviet annexation of these areas.  In any event the policy would be in
 accordance with the Kremlin's strategy of creating easily dominated political entities
 on the Soviet borders.
 In line with guaranteeing Soviet economic interests in Manchuria, the USSR
 will probably retain some special rights in Dairen and in the Port Arthur naval base
 area. This is possible under the 1945 Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance,
 which provides for the special Soviet position in Manchuria.
 The Soviet Government, while attempting to establish in Manchuria the
 virtual autonomy of an absolutely reliable wing of the Chinese Communist Party, will
 not necessarily attempt to deprive the Chinese Communist Government of a nominal
 sovereignty over Manchuria, but will certainly seek to preserve hegemony in that area.
 In this manner, the USSR could better insure its access to the raw materials of Man-
 churia, while at the same time creating a safeguard against possible political deviations
 on the part of Chinese Communist leaders.
 In all likelihood, the USSR favors the formation of an autonomous territory
 of Sinkiang, possibly with a view to creating a new Soviet Union Republic at some time
 in the future.
 The Soviet Union might also induce a Chinese Communist Government to
 relinquish its claim to sections of Inner Mongolia, in favor of the Mongolian People's
 Republic.
 5.   POTENTIAL POINTS OF CONFLICT BETWEEN THE USSR AND CHINESE COMMUNISTS.
 a.      The Issue of US Aid.
 The USSR, intent upon the elimination of US influence from China, would
 almost certainly disapprove a Communist effort to obtain US aid under ECA.  Although
 it is most unlikely that the issue of US aid could in itself effect a change in the orien-
 tation of a Communist-dominated government, it is possible that this issue, especially
 SET                               8

 if the USSR were unable or unwilling to supply the aid itself, would strengthen the
 influence of those groups within the CCP that seek to avoid Soviet domination.
 b.  The Issue of the Border Areas.
 The issue of control of peripheral areas will probably prove to be one of the
 most important testing grounds of Sino-Soviet relations.  The objective of the USSR in
 seeking control of these areas is primarily to strengthen its basic strategic position in
 the Far East.  If, however, it appears to the Chinese Communists, as it may, that the
 USSR is attempting to weaken the Communist Government of China by depriving it
 (whether actually or in effect) of control over the border regions, the possibility of a
 schism within the CCP or between the CCP and Moscow will be increased.  While the
 Communist Government of China would probably not risk open rebellion against the
 USSR over the issue of border areas, aggressive and clumsy maneuvers by the USSR
 in those areas would probably result in the disaffection and insubordination of a sig-
 nificant section of the party.
 c.  The Issue of Communist Movements in the Far East.
 The USSR will of course welcome the assistance of the CCP in promoting the
 growth of Communism in the Far East, but the USSR must prevent the CCP from
 exercising independently a major influence over these movements.  The USSR will
 attempt to control this assistance through existing Soviet channels for liaison and
 direction.  This will be one of the most important areas of potential conflict between
 the USSR and the Chinese Communists.
 d.  The Issue of Subservience to Moscow.
 As extension of Soviet control over the CCP becomes more obvious, it can be
 expected that some cleavages in the Communist high command will occur, possibly
 resulting in the defection of certain leaders.  Adding to the potential dangers facing
 the Soviet Union in its consolidation of power is the large number of present members
 of the Chinese Communist Party who are not convinced Stalinists, and hence not
 altogether reliable as Communists.  Those leaders who wish to oppose Moscow control
 are potential rallying points for the lukewarm elements in the party and the popula-
 tion.  For such opposition to be effective, however, the dissident groups must wrest
 the control apparatus (i.e., party organization, secret police, army) from the pro-
 Moscow leadership, or that leadership itself must change its policy toward Moscow.
 Until evidence is available that an effective opposition is developing, it follows that
 the Chinese Communists will remain allies of Moscow.
