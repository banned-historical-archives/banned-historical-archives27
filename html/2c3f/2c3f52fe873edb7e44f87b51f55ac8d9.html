 7 APRIL 1971
 INDOCHINA
 Hanoi propagandists continue to claim that Operation Lam Son 719
 in Laos was a strategic failure for the allies and a vital blow
 to President Nixon's Vietnemization program.  And the army paper
 QUAN DOI NHAN DAN on 2 April carries the second analysis of the
 operaticr within two weeks under the byline Chien Binh (Combatant).
 The latest article seeinc to press for communist offensive action
 even more directly than the article on 22 I-larch:  Chien Binh says
 that "big annihilating campaigns" are vital for victory and
 maintains that the Lacs campaign demonstrated that the allies
 cannot successfully counter large-scale communist attacks.
 Hanoi's continuing propaganda campaign on the communist "victories"
 gets new impetus with the 6 April release of a communique detailing
 defeats of the allied elements engaged in Lam Son 719 along the
 IQze Sanh front in South Vietnam.  As in the case of the communique
 released two weeks ago on action in Laos, Hanoi radio broadcast a
 special program and the press has highlighted the communique with
 laudatory comment.

 In the wake of the 26 March "grand victory banquet" in Peking, PRC
 media have continued to hail the "crushing defeat" suffered by the
 U.S.-supported ARVN forces in the Laos operation.  Peking has also
 continued to probe the implications of the operation for the
 American political scene, liberally citing Western news repor1-?. to
 demonstrate that President Nixon's "credibility gap" has been
 widened by his effort to portray "defeat as victory."
 Le Duan, address:.ng the 24th CPSU congress on 31 March, briefly
 noted the "glorious victories" by the "liberation" armies of
 Vietnam and Laos in the "Highway 9 theatre" as well. as in Cambodia.
 Gromyko discussed Indochina only briefly in his speech at the
 congress on the 3d and, like Brezhnev in his report on the 30th,
 did no-: mention any such specific issues as the Laos operation.
 But routine Moscow comment continues to discuss the allied "failure"
 in the operation, and a domestic service broadcast on the 4th
 observed that the President was preparing for his 7 April TV speech
 on Indochina by studying a report on a. lied miscalculations in the
 operation,
 DRV ARTICLE PRESSES STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS OF LAOS OPERATION
 CHIEN BINH     The 2 April QUAN DOI NHAN DAN article by Chien Binh
 ARTICLE        provides a concise summation of the jubilant
 communist evaluation of the campaign in Laos against
 the allied Operation Lam Son 719.  Echoing claims he made in earlier

 articles,* Chien Binh maintains that the communists' "defeat"
 of the Laos operation has strategic significance and has
 undermined Vietnamization because of the loss of elite ARVN
 troops and the failure of tactics relying on the use of aircraft,
 tanks, and artillery.  In a notable departure from Hanoi's
 propaganda line of recent years, Chien Binh says flatly that
 the communists are fully able to defeat the allies "militarily."**
 d
 In his 22 March article, Chien Binh had observed merely that the
 South Vietnamese army would be further strained by the continuing
 withdrawal of U.S. troops.  Now, in his article on the 2d, he
 indicates that a significant change has already taken place:
 "After the withdrawal of 200,000 U.S. troops, the balance of
 power on the battlefield has undergone an important change."
 He adds at this point that "the test of Vietnamization has
 entered its fiercest phase."  Chien Binh maintains that the
 test of strength which took place in Laos was inevitable and
 would have occurred sooner or later in one place or another;
 and he says sarcastically that "Nixon cannot act otherwise,
 because he cannot wrap the Saigon puppet army in cellophane and
 keep it forever in Saigon."
 Chien Binh seems to use the Laos campaign to press the argument
 for big unit action--an argument advanced in a unique article
 last December by PRG Defense Minister and PLAF Commander Tran
 Nam Trung.***  Chien Binh stresses the "great importance" of
 "big campaigns of annihilation" such as the one in southern
 Laos.  He asserts that "only by annihilating the enemy's
 military forces by big chunks can we gradually knock out the
 enemy, gradually crush his will, and gradually change the war
 situation in order to advance toward completely militarily
 defeating him."  He maintains that the results of the fighting
 along Highway 9 reflect the relative strengths of the two sides
 *   Chien Binh commented earlier on the Laos incursion in the
 26 February and 14 and 22 March issues of QUAN DOI NHAN DAN.  See
 the 10 March TRENDS, pages 10-11, and 31 March TRENDS, pages 2-5.
 **  Hanoi propagandists typically speak in sloganistic terms that
 "we shall surely win, the U.S. imperialists will surely be
 defeated," leaving ambiguous how the victory is to be achieved.

 in the Indochina conflict and demonstrate that the allied
 forces "cannot col.e S.ith the adversary's large-scab' blows
 of annihilation."
 Chien Binh addresses himself indirectly to the suitabilit;; of
 South Vietnam as a theater for large-scale confrontations in
 his discussion of the effects of the topography of southern Laos
 on the fighting there.  He points out that there are areas in
 South Vietnam which approximate the cc:nditions of the-areas
 where heavy fighting has occurred in both Laos and Cambodia:
 "South Vietnam, like the southern Laos area, does not lack
 hills and mountains and, like the Kratie-Kompong Chem area in
 Cambodia, does not lack lowlands."  Seeming to stress his
 recognition of the efficacy of various kinds of warfare, he
 not only notes that guerrilla fighting is appropriate to some
 areas but adds that "it is not true that there must be large-
 scale combat in all areas."
 Chien Binh does not characterize the spate of attacks on allied
 positions in South Vietnam in the wake of the Laos campaign,
 but he claims that the fighting this spring shows that the
 "resistance" forces "can simultaneously swing many blows on
 many battlefields in southern Laos, Cambodia, northern Laos,
 the high plateaus, the central Trung Bo coastal areas, and
 the Nam Bo delta."  He maintains that the allies have been "on
 the defensive everywhere" and that they are limited in their
 ability to reinforce even an important front.
 FIGHTING IN       Hanoi media have greeted recent communist
 SOUTH VIETNAM     attacks in Kontum and Quang Nam as "outstand-
 ing annihilation battles" that demonstrate
 their "firm initiative" on the battlefield.  This evaluation
 appears, for example, in a 2 April NHAN DAN commentary which
 acclaims the 27 March attack on the U.S. base Mary Ann in
 Quang Nam, the 29-30 March assault on Duc Duc district capital.
 in the same province, and the overrunning of ARVN firebase 6
 in Kontum (designated Hill 1001 by the communists) on 31 March,
 as well as other actions in South Vietnam.  The paper comments
 that the attacks countered "Nixon's scheme to prolong the
 aggressive war and to reduce the U.S. troop casualties under the
 Vietnamization plan."
 Offering details on the three major attacks, the NHAN DAN
 article and other commentaries claim that the attack on the
 Mary Ann base "completely annihilated" a battalion of the

 196th Brigade of the America]. Division.  QUAN DOI NHAN DAN on
 the 6th reports that the attack was launched by Quang Nam
 regional troops and claims that they returned to their position
 "without suffering any casualties."  The communists allege
 that a combined ARVN infantry-artillery battalion was wiped
 out and many U.S. advisers and ARVN troops captured in the
 attack on firebase 6.  Nearly 300 allied troops are said to
 have been put out of action when Due Due was attacked and
 "controller?."
 PLAF TALLIES "VICTORIES" OVER LAOS OPERATION IN QIL4NG TRI
 A PRG press conference in Hanoi on the 6th made public a
 4 April communique of the PLAF command on the Khe Sanh front
 which tabulates alleged allied losses in Quang Tri along
 Highway 9 from 30 January to 31 March.  Giving special
 attention to the communique, as it did to a similar 24 March
 communique from the Laotian "liberation" forces command,
 Hanoi publicized it in special radio broadcasts on the Quang
 Tri fighting on the night of the 6th and featured it, along
 with editorial comment, in two-color issues of the press.
 on the 7th.  Ridiculing the dispatch of allied forces to
 Highway 9 and the incursion into Laos as a "foolish strategic
 scheme," the communique repeats communist claims that Laotian
 and South Vietnamese forces along Highway 9 "dealt crushing
 blows of great strategic significance" to the allied troops.
 All told, according to the communique, the forces in South
 Vietnam put out of action nearly 7,000 allied troops,
 including 4,054 G1'd; destroyed 863 military vehicles,
 including 236 tanks and armcred cars; and shot down or
 destroyed 234 aircraft on the ground.  In addition, they are
 said to have wrec'"ed 72 cannon and big mortars, sunk or set
 afire 42 warships and combat launches, destroyed 41 big
 logistic storages and materiel dumps, and set fire to
 millions of liters of gasoline and thousands of tons of
 weapons, ammw.iition, food, and military equipment.
 The communique repeats the claim that Quang Tri forces overran.
 a position of the ARVN 39th Ranger Battalion on Hill 500--a
 hill located in Laos according to allied maps, but placed
 inside South Vietnam by maps on the fighting published in the
 Hanoi press.  Indirectly acknowledging the contradiction in
 locating the hill, the communique notes that the attack took

 place at a time when the prongs of the allied incursion were
 intercepted and besieged in Laos and that it "contributed to
 the smashing of the enemy's northern prong."*
 The 7 April NI-IAN DAN editorial spells out the communist claims,
 saying the communique's figures indicate that the fighters
 annihilated approximately one-third of the allied forces on
 the Khe Sanh front and destroyed more than two-thirds of the
 allies' military vehicles and one-third of their artillery
 pieces.  Comparing the recent fighting around Khe Sanh to
 the siege of the Khe Sanh base in 1968, the editorial vows
 that "this generation and generations to come will always
 remember our compatriots and fighters who fought valiantly
 and resourcefully, surmounted all difficulties and hardships,
 twice accepted the U.S. aggressors' challenge, and on both
 occasions triumphed gloriously, scoring victories of
 strategic importance."
 THIEU PRESS     Hanoi media view President Thieu's 31 March
 CONFERENCE      press conference in Dong Ha as a maneuver to
 save face and bolster morale in the wake of
 the ARVN's "defeat" Ln Laos.  An article in the 2 April QUAN
 DOI NHAN DAN ridiculed Thieu's "braggings" and his announce-
 ment "with fanfare" that South Vietnamese commandos had been
 "lifted to some places near the Laos-South Vietnam border."
 Acknowledging more details of Thieu's announcement, a Hanoi
 domestic service broadcast on the 2d said Thieu "created the
 false story thE.t the puppet troops had just attacked a
 communist headquarters in southern Laos."  Reflecting reports
 that the commando raid was timed at communist base area 611,
 the broadcast declareC that the allies "are trying to fool
 public opinion, pretending that they were not defeated in
 Laos and are sending hundreds of commandos to attack Hill 611
 in Laos."  It made no reference to Thieu's statement, at the
 same press conference, that South Vietnamese forces are
 capable of launching attacks against the DRV without U.S.
 support.

 he and NFLSV delegate Nguyen Van Hieu, speaking on the 2d, said
 that the Vietnamization policy and the Nixon Doctrine have
 received serious setbacks most recently during the allied
 invasion of Laos and in the operation,4 along Highway 9.    Both
 also reaffirmed the communist stand that a proper basis for a
 polit4'al settlement is provided by the 10-point NFLSV/PRG
 proposal and the eight-point elaboration.  Consistent with the
 usual North Vietnamese even-handedness regarding its two big
 allies, Le Duan cited China as well as the Soviet Union in
 expressing gratitude for aid from the socialist countries.
 In castigating the United States for continued "escalation" of
 the war, both Le Duan and Hieu denounced U.S. "threats" against
 the DRV* and preparations for "new military adventures" there.
 They had not mentioned the alleged danger of action against the
 DRV at the 26 March "victory" banquet in Peking, an omission
 the more notable in that Chvu En-lai did so in remarks on the
 same occasion.
 SOVIET        Indochina was discussed only briefly and in general
 SPEAKERS      terms by Grechko on the 2d and Gromyko on the 3d.
 Both cited the war as an example of the perfidy
 and aggressiveness of U.S. foreign policy in general and,
 following the lead of Brezhnev's 30 March report, neither
 ,discussed the Laos operation specifically.  Gromyko denounced
 the United States for propagating the "falsehood" that it would
 like to withdraw its troops from Vietnam while simultaneously
 committing aggression there and in Cambodia and Laos as well.
 *  The DRV Foreign Ministry spokesman on 6 April issued another
 in the continuing :pries of statements on U.S. air strikes,
 this one protesting strikes from 31 March to I April on
 villages in the DMZ.  On 1 April the media carried statements
 by the DRV and PRG spokesmen in Paris recalling that they had
 called off the session of the Paris talks or 25 March in
 protest over the concentrated air strikes on the 21-22 and that
 the United States, with "no justification," had cancelled the
 1 April session.

 He did not discuss a political settlement, but in another
 section of his speech he cited Indochina as an example when
 he contrasted the honesty and peaceableness of Soviet foreign
 policy with efforts by the United States to mask its own
 "aggression."  He said the United States had "adopted" the
 Geneva agreements of 1954 and 1962, which were designed to
 serve peace in Indochina, but was not "embarrassed" by this
 when it decided to unleash aggression there.
 Grechko said that the "American imperialists," who have never
 stopped preparing for aggression, are using Vietnam as a
 "testing ground" for their strategy.  He briefly called
 attention to the USSR's "selfless aid" to the Vietnamese as
 an example of the Soviet Union's devotion to its international
 duty.
 Kosygin mentioned Indochina only in passing in his report on the
 five-year plan, pointing to the need to strengthen the USSR's
 armed forces in the face of a complex international situation
 4.n which imperialism resorts to "military adventures and
 direct aggression," exemplified by the "disgraceful, dirty,
 bandit war in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos."
 PATHET LAO DELEGATE AT CPSU CONGRESS THANKS MOSCOW FOR AID
 The speech at the CPSU congress by NLHS delegate Kaysone Phomvihan
 on the 3d was notable for an expression of thanks to the Soviets
 for their "tremendous and invaluable aid and support" to the
 Laotian people's struggle against the "U.S. imperialists."  This
 speech was publicized in Moscow media as well as by the Pathet
 Lao and was published in PRAVDA on 4 April.  The reports of the
 speech were followed on the 7th by a Moscow domestic service
 report that at a meeting in the Lao "liberated areas" held to
 celebrate recent "military victories," participants spoke of
 the "Laotian patriots"' gratitude for Soviet "aid and support."
 Moscow elite propaganda has generally been less direct than
 this regarding aid to the Pathet Lao, but such explicit references
 have appeared in routine comment originated by Moscow as well as
 in Pathet Lao statements publicized by Soviet media.  The
 25 February 1971 Soviet Government statement on the Laos operation
 promised continued aid to the "patriots of Indochina," thus
 implicitly including the Pathet Lao.  Brezhnev had conveyed
 a similar implication in his 12 June 1970 election speech when

 he followed an expression of support for the "Just principles
 and demands advanced by the patriotic forces of the peoples
 of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos" with the pledge that "we shall
 render all the necessary assistance to those who are fighting
 for their freedom and independence."
 At the routine propaganda level, more explicit references to
 aid appeared, for example, in connection with the 15th anniversary.
 of the NLHS on 6 January 1971 and the 25th anniversary of Laotian
 independence on 12 October 1970:  There were promises on those
 occasions of continued Soviet "assistance" or "help" to the
 "Laotian patriots."  Statements publicized in Moscow media in
 which NLHS leaders expressed gratitude for Soviet "assistance"
 included remarks by NLHS Chairman Souphanouvong in an interview
 in KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on 27 November 1970 and by NLHS Secretary
 General Phoumi Vongvichit in a PRAVDA interview on 12 May 1970.
 "VANGUARD PARTY"     While Kaysone Phoumvihan is attending the
 CPSU congress in his capacity as vice
 chairman of the NLHS Central Committee, the role of the clandestine
 Lao communist party was hinted at in a passage in his speech in
 which he noted that the Lao people's struggle is being carried
 on "under the correct leadership of the vanguard party."  He
 has been identified as secretary general of the clandestine
 "Lao People's Party."  On the occasion of the 25th anniversary
 of Laos independence on 12 October, he authored an article--
 carried by the Pathet Lao news agency on 5 October--on the history
 of a "genuine revolutionary party" in Laos.*

 CONVICTION OF CALLEY FOR SON MY MASSACRE CALLED "COVER-UP"
 DRV AND PRG     The first monitored reaction in Vietnamese
 communist media to Lieutenant Calley's con-
 viction:'.and sentencing to life imprisonment for his role in
 the March 1968 Son My "massacre" came early on 3 April when
 Hanoi radio broadcast an item from the army paper QUAN DOI
 NHAN DAN and Liberation Radio carried a commentary.  The
 DRV and PRG spokesmen in Paris at a 2 April press conference
 had denounced what t'_cy called President Nixon's decision "to
 temporarily set free" Lieutenant Calley, but these statements
 were not carried in communist media until the 3d.
 Comment uniformly says that the trial was held to cover up
 crimes committed by the U.E. "aggressors" for years in Vietnam
 and that public opinion is demanding that Calley's superiors
 also be punished.  The QUAN DOI NHAN DAN article and one in
 the party paper NHAN DAN on the 4th say the United States
 tried to cover up the Son My "massacre," the latter recalling
 that the Central Trung Bo Liberation Front committee "had
 immediately protested" the 1968 "massacre."  NHAN DAN adds
 that the United States still refused to admit that the massacre
 took place even when the case wab brought to light by the New
 York TIMES in November 1969.*
 Consiste-it with the line that U.S. public opinion has become
 increasingly appalled at U.S. "crimes" in South Vietnam,** the
 comment blurs the fact that a strong current of opinion be-
 lieves Calley should not be punished at all.  NHAN DAN says the
 U.S. public is indignant "not because the sertence was too harsh
 or too lenient but because the U.S. war of aggression in Vietnam
 had piled up such horrible crimes."  Both papers cite press
 assessments that Calley is only a "scapegoat" convicted to
 relieve higher-ranking officials of responsibility; they also
 quote Senator Fulbright--in a 1 April TV interview--to the
 effect -U'-hat to shift responsibility onto a lieutenant is

 DRV War Crimes Commission scoring "crimes" during March, includ-
 ing alleged killings of civilians in the course of the "pacifica-
 tion" program in South Vietnam and as a result of U.S. bombings
 of villages in the North.

 "debatable" and that the investigation should be carried up
 to the level of the commander-in-chief.
 MOSCOW     Unlike the Vietnamese communists, Moscow
 promptly reported the conviction and sentencing
 of Calley.  A domestic service broadcast on the 30th said
 that the majority came out unscathed while Calley became
 the "scapegoat."  According to TASS on the 31st, PRAVDA's
 New York correspondent Kolesnichenko said that the hastozy
 of the trial is one of Pentagon efforts to first suppress
 the crime and then see that most of those involved escape
 justice.  The PRAVDA correspondent acknowledged the various
 currents of U.S. opinion when hF said that during the trial
 "the gap between the democratic n.nd reactionary parts of
 America became wider," with the "authorities" trying to
 present Calley as a "lone maniac" and "reactionary circles"
 wishing to make him "almost a hero," while indignation at
 U.S. "crimes" in Vietnam is mounting throughout the country.
 Reporting the sentence of life imprisonment, TABS on
 1 April said that the Pentagon put Calley on trial "under
 pressure by the indignant public" but that "the main
 initiators  of this bloodbath escaped punishment."
 The next day TABS cited Fulbright's statement that such
 "representatives of principal political authorities
 and the supreme military command as, for example,
 former commander-in-chief of the U.S. forces in South
 Vietnam General Westmoreland, should be held accountable."
 On the 3d TABS reported Westmoreland's denial that he
 was responsible, commenting that he thus tried to "shift
 responsibility" to the lieutenants and sergeants.
 The President's actions in the case--the transfer of
 Calley back to his quarters and the announcement that he
 would give the final review--were noted without comment
 by TABS on the 4th.
 On 7 April TABS reported that Captain Daniel, prosecuting
 attorney at the Calley trial, sent a message to President
 Nixon protesting his "direct interference in the
 administrati(.it of justice" and expressing shock that
 the Presiden- had "ordered the Son My hangman to be
 released from prison."  TABS added that "many Americans"
 see politics behind the decision of the President, "whose
 sharp loss of prestige makes him flirt with the more
 reactionary forces."

 PEKING     Peking's only mention of the Calley verdict thus
 far came on 5 April in an NCNA commentary calling
 the trial a "farce" designed to "defend the 'commander' at
 the expense of the 'pawns."  The commentary notes that
 complex appeal procedures will now go into effect and that
 it may take several years to obtain a final conviction.  NCNA
 calls attention to the fact that President Nixon ordered
 that Calley be "released from Army custody and remain in his
 quarters."  Remarking on the President's "deep sympathy" for
 Calley, it asserts that Son My was not an isolated incident
 and that "the number-one criminal of all these violent acts
 is none other than the supreme commander of the U.S. forces,
 U.S. imperialist chieftain Nixon."  In this connection, NCNA
 briefly notes Fulbright's view that the responsibility for
 Calley's crimes should be "traced to the supreme commander
 (Nixon)."

 CPSU CONGRESS
 SOVIET POLICY OF PEACE ENDORSED BY GROWKO. KOSYGIN
 In his 3 April rundown of foreign policy issues before the
 CPSU congress, Foreign Minister Gromyko followed the broad
 outlines of Brezhnev's 30 March Central Committee report
 in stressing the Soviet policy of coexistence and avoidance
 of war.  Gronnyko made explicit what Brezhnev had only
 implied when he reaffirmed that the USSR supports the
 resolution of all outstanding international problems "by
 peaceful means, by means of negotiations."
 In his 6 April report on the Soviet economy, Kosygin touched
 briefly on foreign affairs, following the lead of Brezhnev
 and Gromyko in pledging the USSR to a policy of peaceful
 coexistence and in indicting the United States for its
 "bandit" war in Indochina and its support for Israel.
 But unlike the other two spokesmen, he takes the occasion
 to reassert the thesis that the USSR does "not regard war
 as inevitable."
 In the defense of the "Leninist" peaceful coexistence policy
 and the concluding of agreements with capitalist states,
 Gromyko's remarks seem implicitly aimed at the Chinese and
 other radical critics, both on the right and the left.  Thus
 he asserted that it is "equally alien to us to shrink back
 in the face of the imperialists' threats or to be attracted
 by ultra.cevolutionary phrases."  Both postures, Gromyk:o
 says, reflect an underestimation of the strength of the
 socialist countries and the progressive forces of the world.
 In Gromyko's words, true Marxism-Leninism is shown neither
 by failing "to keep one's nerve under control when clashing
 with imperialism" or by "ostentatious placard ultrarevolu-
 tionariness."  Gronlyrko almo observed that the USSR's policy
 of peaceful coexistence does not extend to the ideological
 sphere.
 Gromyko contrasts the honesty and openness of Soviet foreign
 policy with U.S. policy based allegedly on "falsehood,"
 citing as %h- prime example of the latter U.S. expressions
 of readiness tj withdraw troops from Vietnam while
 simultaneously committing "aggression" there and in Laos

 and Cambodia.  He characterizes the Indochina conflict as
 "the most dangerous military conflict since World War II and
 ':   most bloody."  And he routinely takes the United States
 to task for its support of Israel and for its role--along
 with other Western powers--in maintaining tension in Europe.
 At the same time, Gromyko observes, as did Brezhnev, that
 better relations with the United States are both desirable
 and possible, and he implores Washington to weigh "in all
 seriousness" everything that Brezhnev said in his speech
 of the 30th.  He urges that the United States back its
 professed desire for talks with practical deeds, and
 complains that it has not always shown a readiness to
 do this.  The USSR for its part, he observes, favors
 "serious talks," those in which the participants "do not
 try to trip each other up but really try to find
 agreement."  In this connection, he charges that the
 United States has engaged in "zigzags" in the current
 talks on Berlin, on the talks on convening a conference
 on European security, "on questions of the Middle East,
 and on controlling the strategic arms race."
 Notably absent from the speech--which appears in PRAVDA
 on the 4th--are references to the potpourri of
 disarmament measures which Brezhnev had mentioned in his
 remarks.  Routine propagande. since the 30th has, however,
 mentioned them in passing, including the call for a
 conference of the five nuclear powers to discuss nuclear
 disarmament.  In one instance, at least, propaganda has
 credited France with the initiative for such a conference.
 A Paris-datelined TASS dispatch in PRAVDA on the 2d,
 reporting French reaction to Brezhnev's remarks on the
 proposal, said that circles in Paris are recalling that
 France has supported such a proposal "over the course
 of 10 years."
 Gromyko sustains the USSR'sr rejection of the notion--
 pressed by the United States and FRG, among others--
 that a European security conference cannot be convened
 before the Berlin problem is resolved.  According to him,
 the ratification of the FRG's treaties with the USSR
 and Poland, the settlement of the FRG's relations with
 the other socialist states, the successful conclusion
 of the Berlin talks, and the holding of a conference
 "have to be implemented in parallel, without waiting
 for the end of pro,.:edings in one direction before
 passing on to another."

 Kosygin also mentions a European security conference, noting
 that its convening would help to increase confidence on the
 continent and would open the way for broad economic and
 scientific-technological cooperation.  Additionally, he
 says, it would create conditions for solving such problems
 as the building of large power-transmission lines and the
 establishment on this basis oe a single European power grid.
 BREZI4NEV GETS UNEVEN FOREIGN CP SUPPORT ON UNITY ISSUES
 Speaking at the windup of the CPSU congress' discussion of
 his 30 March report, Brezhnev on 5 April ritualistically
 expressed gratification over the delegates' unanimous
 approval of the Central Committee's policies and went on
 to register the CPSU's aspirations for interna'1,onal
 communist unity in words nlmost identical to his windup
 speech at the 1966 congress:  The conclave, he said, was
 proceeding "in an atmosphere of passionate, Bolshevist
 international solidarity with all the socialist countries,
 the communists of the whole world, all the fighters against
 imperialism."
 The speeches by foreign party guests at the congress,
 generally available in TASS summaries followed by Radio
 Moscow broadcasts of texts in the languages of the
 countries concerned, registered a general effort to
 submerge the pivotal issues underlying dissensions in
 the international movement.  Thus Brezhnev's 30 March
 attack on Peking--echoed almost to a man by the Soviet
 republic speakers--drew only scattered support from
 spokesmen for parties outside the Soviet bloc, in
 contrast to the chorus of anti-Chinese attacks by delegates
 at the June 1969 Moscow international communist conference.
 And the foreign guests, except for Husak himself, almost
 uniformly avoided the still rankling issue of the
 intervention in Czechoslovakia.
 Despite the evident effort to mute divisive subjects,
 undercurrents of continuing dissension in the movement
 were present in the speeches of the independent-minded
 party spokesmen in particular.  The vigorous defense
 of the intervention in Czechoslovakia by Brezhnev and
 Husak did not appear to set well with past critics of

 the Warsaw Five's action.  The Italian CP organ L'UNITA
 repr,-ed that some of the delegates, including the Italian,
 fai.L_.i to applaud Husak's address out of displeasure over
 his defense of the intervention.      And French CP delegate
 Marchais, in an interview with L'HUMANITE, expressed
 displeasure over Husak's speech--an obvious embarrassment
 to the nonruling European parties.  Ceausescu's strong
 emphasis on the impermissibility of interference in the
 affairs of other parties and his lecture on the need to
 resolve disputes through talks, not polemics, registered
 Lae Romanians' reaction both to the treatment of the
 Czechoslovak issue by Brezhnev and Husak and to the Soviet
 leader's attack on Peking.
 CHINA     Support for Brezhnev's attack on Peking was
 notably absent from the speech of the SED's
 Walter Ulbricht, who had vigorously backed Moscow on
 the issue at the 1969 conference.  Outside the congress,
 however, Ulbricht's heir apparent, Erich Honecker,
 attacked "the group around Mao Tse-tung and its furious
 anti-Sovietism" in a speech in Magnitogorsk reported by
 ADN on the 4th.  And an attack on "the Mao Tse-tung group,"
 a formulation generally avoided by Moscow in its own
 name in recent months, appeared in a NEUES DEUTSCHLAND
 editorial on the congress summarized by PRAVDA on 29 March.
 The party chiefs of Moscow's other Warsaw Pact allies,
 with the predictable exception of Ceausescu, repeated
 the positions taken by their parties at the 1969 conference
 in openly taking the Chinese to task in their congress
 speeches.  The Polish party's new First Secretary, Gierek,
 given the honor of being the second foreign party speaker
 after the DRV's Le Duan, followed up his 29 March PRAVDA
 article in registering strong support for Moscow, declaring
 that "the attitude toward the CPSU, toward the country of
 the Soviets, constitutes the best proof of action in favor
 of the unity of the socialist and anti-imperialist forces."
 Assailing "those who do not understand this truth" and "from
 anti-Soviet positions are bringing splits" into the
 movement, Gierek stated that "the present policy of the
 leaders of the COP aimed against the unity of the
 socialist states, and especially its attacks on the CPSU9
 cannot undermine the solidarity of the fraternal parties
 with the Soviet communists" but "can only lead to
 progressive isolation" of those following this course.

 As the first foreign party speaker at the 1 April session, Husak
 "condemned the malicious, slanderous campaign and the destructive
 aims of the leadership of the CCP against Czechoslovakia, against
 other socialist countries, and primarily against the Soviet
 Union," according to the apparent text broadcast by Radio Moscow
 in Czech cnd Slovak on 1 April.  At the same session, Hungary's
 Kadar assailed "the disruptive activity of the Chinese leaders"
 and stressed that his party had "firmly condemned" this activity,
 "as is generally known, from the beginning."
 The most slavish followers of the CPSU line, Bulgaria's Zhivkov
 and Mongolia's Tsedenbal, delivered strong attacks on the Chinese
 at the 1 and 2 April sessions, respectively.  While TASS' report
 of the 2 April proceedings reported Tsedenbal only as attacking
 "the splitting activity of the Chinese leaders," the text carried
 in PRAVDA on the 3d quoted him also as stigmatizing "the Chinese
 apostates from Marxism-Leninism"--stronger words than any Brezhnev
 had used on the subject at the congress.
 Where some 50 foreign parties had joined the chorus of anti-China
 attacks at the 1969 international communist conference, however,
 only a minority of spokesmen for uonruling parties joined the
 leaders of the Soviet-lining ruling parties in directly assailing
 Peking this time.  Numerous others who had spoken out on the
 issue in 1969 joined the independent-minded Romanians, Cubans,
 Yugoslavs, and Italian communists in staying silent on the issue
 now.  The parties whose spokesmen again, as in 1969, attacked
 Peking included the Indian, Danish, Portuguese, and U.S., as
 well as severpt pro-Soviet Latin American CP's.
 Radio Moscow's broadcasts in Mandarin have pressed home the con-
 gress attacks on the Chinese.  One on the 2d carried excerpts
 from Tsedenbal's congress speech, including the reference to the
 Chineca as apostates.  Another on the next day, a commentary by
 Latyshev entitled "The Isolation of the Chinese Leaders on the
 International Stage," noted among other things that "the anti-
 Soviet activity of the Chinese leaders was also widely condemned"
 by the CP's of "various" countries among the "more than 100"
 foreign delegations.  A broadcast on the 4th quoted a Soviet worker
 delegate to the congress to the effect that "by making no mention
 if our congress, the Chinese propaganda machine has slandered our
 party and people
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA        With the exception of Husak, who obediently

 Brezhnev's denunciation of "rightwing opportunism"--the orthodox
 tag applied to the 1968 Prague liberalization--without direct
 reference to Czechoslovakia. Although an article in the 3 April
 Bratislava PRAVDA, reported by CTK, commented that the congress
 speeches of Gierek, Ulbricht, Kadar, Ceausescu, and Zhivkov "all
 paid. great attention to the Czechoslovak events of 1968 and 1969,"
 available texts of the speeches indicate that none of them men-
 tioned these events directly.
 Of the nonruling party spokesmen whose statements are available,
 only Argentina's Ghioldi explicitly supported the Soviet action
 in Czechoslovakia.  According to TASS on the 3d, he recalled at
 that day's session that "imperialist reaction, with the aid of
 revisionists, renegades, and bourgeois elements, made an attempt
 to sever Czechoslovakia from the world socialist system," but
 "the community of the socialist states, led by the Sovi ' Union,
 has proved beyond any doubt its strength and inviolabilii;y."*
 These remarks were included in a version of the speech broadcast
 on the 4th by Radio Moscow in Spanish to Cuba, with the added
 comment that by the 1968 intervention the world socialist system,
 led by the Soviet Union, had proven "that it possesses everything
 necessary to repel aggression."
 INDEPENDENT-MINDED PARTIES STRESS NONINTERFERENCE, DIVERSITY
 CEAUSESCU     Without mentioning either China or Czechoslovakia
 directly, Romania's Ceausescu made it clear in his
 1 April address to the congress that Bucharest's view of the
 1968 events and its resolve to stay neutral in the Sino-Soviet
 dispute remain unchanged.  His notably pointed emphasis on the
 independence of parties and the necessity of avoiding interfer-
 ence in their internal affairs may also have been responsive in
 part to Brezhnev's call for CEMA integration and his stress on
 the Warsaw Pact's role in "coordinating" foreign policy.
 Ceausescu's firm defense of Romania's own national course also
 came against the background of the recently concluded visit
 to Peking--the second in five months--by a Romanian delegation
 led by Deputy Premier Radulescu, which served in effect to balance
 off Ceausescu's attendance at the CPSU congress.  The Peking visit

 Ceausescu began his remarks, as reported by Radio Bucharest,
 by referring to Moscow's "remarkable accomplishments" as "a
 very important contribution to strengthening the world
 socialist system."  But he indicated Romania's order of
 priorities by devoting the major portion of his relatively
 brief speech to an outline of Romania's own accomplishments,
 adding wryly in this context:  "In all our activity we are
 guided by the well-known Marxist-Leninist thesis according
 to which the main duty of the governing communist party is
 to build the new social system."
 After paying brief tribute to the importance of Romanian-
 Soviet relations, Ceausescu went on to indirectly challenge
 the Soviet view of party relations and of how to handle
 disputes among parties.  Noting that "differences" among
 parties exist on ways to build socialism and on some
 international questions, he in effect lectured those
 who had censured the Chinese at the congress that
 differences are not properly resolved by such polemical
 attacks:  "The way to resolve differences is by having
 discussion from party to party, from leadership to
 leadership in a spirit of mutual faith and esteem."
 In an apparent allusion to such Soviet actions as the
 invasion of Czechoslovakia, he added:  "Our party
 speaks out against any interference in the internal
 affairs of other parties, for this leads to the weakening
 of their unity and fighting capacity against the c._.ass
 enemy."
 Ceausesc-, promised once again that Romania will continue
 to foster good relations with "all" communist parties
 "in the spirit of mutual trust and esteem and recognition
 of every party's right independently to elaborate its
 political line in keeping with the concrete conditions
 prevailing in its country."  He added:  "We will also
 expand our relations with other socialist, progressive,
 and anti-imperialist forces."
 In the wake of Brezhnev's call for CEMA integration,
 Ceausescu limited himself to expressing Romanian
 willingness for further "cooperation" in that body,
 stipulating that CEMA cooperation "must lead to the
 development of each socialist country and to the
 strengthening of their independence as free and
 sovereign states."  He pointedly failed to mention the
 Warsaw Pact.

 The TASS account of Ceausescu's remarks predictably focused
 on his brief comments on Soviet achievements and Soviet-
 Romanian relations; it omitted his reci-uation of Romanian
 accomplishments and did not reflect his comments on CEMA
 and on the way to handle interparty differences.
 TODOROVIC     In   speech to the congress on 2 April as
 repor-Ued by Radio Belgrade, Yugoslav Executive
 Bureau member Tcdorovic played the independence and
 noninterference themes in less emphatic fashion than
 Ceausescu, expressing satisfaction with the favorable
 development of Yugoslav-Soviet relations "en the basis
 of the principles of equality, mutual respect, and
 noninterference, which represent the best guarantees for
 the successful development of relations between peoples
 and states."
 The Yugoslav representative also used the occasion to
 reaffirm Belgrade's opposition to any leading center
 in the world movement and to appeal for diversity in
 the movement's ranks:  "The equr.lity of paths and wealth
 of forms are the expression of tie breadth and intensity
 of the modern socialist transformation of the world.
 Differences which stem from this reality are the source
 of the creative force and of the consolidation of
 socialism under conditions of a democratic exchange
 of views and cooperation among equal and sovereign
 movements and countries."
 In remarks that may have been responsive to Brezhnev's
 statement that "the Soviet people want to see socialism
 in Yugoslavia strengthened," Todorovic defended
 Yugoslavia's self-management course ana assured his
 listeners that planned constitutional changes--and
 resultant further decentralization--are designed to
 "strengthen" the Yugoslav community and are under
 the disciplined control of the Yugoslav League of
 Communists.
 BERLINGUER    Italian Communist Party (PCI) deputy leader
 Enrique Berlinguer, addressing the CPSU
 congress on 1 April, transparently reasserted the Italian
 party's dissent from the Soviet concept of internationalism
 that was used to justify the intervention in Czechoslovakia,
 as well as its objections to Moscow's present views on

 communist unity.  Berlinguer stated that "our international
 solidarity" does not and cannot mean "our full identification
 with the choices which each socialist country, and more
 generally each communist and workers party, has made and
 is making on its own responsibility."  And "our internationalism,"
 he said, is based on "recognition of the full independence
 of each country and each party and leaves the way open, as
 has alreely happened, to moments and circumstances of
 dissension. and divergence, without in any way, as a result
 of thi.s, weakening solidarity and duty in the struggle for
 the great aims which unite us."
 As if to document an approach combining unity with diversity,
 Berlinguer promised that his party will continue the fight
 against any "manifestations of anti-Sovietism"--an apparent
 allusion to the PCI's ouster of the dissident IL MANIFESTO
 group--and will continue to study the experiences of other
 parties, while developing its own specific contribution
 deriving from its own experiences ani ideas.
 An unattributed statement in the PCI organ L'UNITA on 3 April,
 explaining why the PCI delegation failed to applaud Husak's
 address to the congress, linked Berlinguer's statement on
 internationalism to the PCI's opposition to the intervention
 in Czechoslovakia.  The paper commented that the concept of
 sovereignty expounded by Ausak in defense of the 1968 action
 "confirmed and even menticned further developments along
 the same unacceptable line."  It added:  "Our line, confirmed
 by Berlinguer," is shared by other parties, and "this is why
 Husak's speech has aroused reactions among various delegations
 at the CPSU congress, including the Italian one--delegations
 which did not in fact applaud the concepts expressed in that
 speech."
 MARCHAIS     In an orthodox address to the congress on
 31 March, French Communist Party (PCF) Deputy
 Secretary General Georges Marchais expressed the PCF's
 general support for the independence and sovereignty
 of all parties, then seemed to cancel this out by
 adding:  "but at the same time, we believe that proletarian
 internationalism, the joint action of all the communist
 parties on a Marxist-Leninist basis, is a sacred duty and
 indeed the prerequisite of our struggle"--a statement, that
 smacks of the Brezhnev doctrine.

 For evident domestic political purposes, Marchais sought
 to mitigate the impact of such a pro-Soviet line for his
 domestic constituency in an interview with a L'HUMANITE
 correspondent the next day, published in the paper on the
 3d.  He explained that he had failed to "recall the
 well-known and unchanged attitude" of the PCF toward
 the August 1968 intervention in Czechoslovakia because
 the PCF delegates were "guests" in the Soviet Union and
 wished to avoid polemics in the interests of communist
 unity.  Marchais also displayed sensitivity to the
 "regrettable" fact that Husak "saw fit to devote the
 main part of his address" to a presentation of the
 CPCZ's views on the issue--a presentation "which
 implied criticism of our own attitude."  The CPCZ's
 concept of sovereignty, he added, "seems to us alien
 to the principles of the 1969 Moscow conference."

 EFFORTS TO BUILD UP BREZHNEVIS STATURE APPARENT
 In speeches on the first day of discussion following delivery
 of his report, Brezhnev received considerable personal
 attention, quite in contrast to the 1966 congress.  The
 effort to set Brezhnev apart from the collective and to
 attribute to him a personal leadership role--an effort
 evident at a handful of the pro-Brezhnev republican congresses
 in February and March, those of Kazakhstan, Azerbaydzhan,
 Moldavia, and Kirgizia--is clearly continuing at the Cz'SU Congress.
 No speaker, however, has yet used the controversial formulation,
 the Politburo "headed by" Brezhnev.
 More significant than the flattery on the part of obvious
 Brezhnev supporters such as Kazakh First Secretary Kunayev
 and Gorkiy First Secretary Maslennikov is the unusual praise
 expressed by Belorussian First Secretary Masherov, Leningrad
 First Secretary Romanov, and Georgian First Secretary
 Mzhavanadze, who have been reticent in the past.  Ukrainian
 First Secretary Shelest, however, followed his past practice
 of avoiding praise of Brezhnev.
 Kazakh First Secretary Kunayev, pacesetter for those who seek
 to laud Brezhnev, hailed his report as an important contri-
 bution to Marxism-Leninism and declared that it is "necessary
 to stress especially comrade L.I. Brezhnev's ability to unite
 the collective and direct the efforts of the whole Central
 Committee for fruitful work . . ." (PRAVDA, 1 April).  Uzbek
 First Secretary Rashidov, who was the most flattering to
 Brezhnev at the 1966 congress, spoke of the party information
 system as the "enormous accomplishment of the Politburo, the
 Central Committee Secretariat, and L.I. Brezhnev personally";
 he al .) credited Brez}-iev with overseeing the working out of
 initial measures to aid Tashkent after its earthquake (PRAVDA,
 2 April).  Gorkiy First Secretary Maslennikov, a follower
 of Brezhnev's protege Katushev, praised the Central Committee,
 the Politburo, and General Secretary Brezhnev for courage and
 vigilance against antisocialist forces and for doing every-
 thing necessary to strengthen the unity of socialist countries
 (PRAVDA, 1 April).  Krasnodar First Secretary Zolotukhin
 praised the Central C.).mittee, the Politburo, and General
 Secretary Brezhnev for leading the party and country "with
 great mastery and in a Leninist ;ray," and he hailed the land
 improvement program adopted by the Central Committee "on the
 initiative of comrade L.I. Brezhnev" (PRAVDA, 2 April).

 Apparently influenced by the pro-Brezhnev atmosphere, Masherov,
 Romanov, and Mzhavanadze showed new willingness to give Brezhnev
 praise and persona: credit.  Masherov stated that the "huge
 efforts" in agriculture undertaken by the Politburo and "comrade
 L.Z. Brezhnev personally" have already brought good results
 (PRAVDA, 1 April).  Romanov praised Brezhnev's reports on the
 50th anniversary of the revolution and on Lenin's anniversary
 as an "important contribution" to theory and noted approvingly
 the constant readiness of the Central Committee, the Politburo,
 and General Secretary Brezhnev "personally" to give counsel
 and aid to Leningrad (PRAVDA, 1 April).  While Mzhavanadze did
 not go so far as to give Brezhnev "personal" credit for any-
 thing, he did praise Brezhnev's report as "brilliant" (PRAVDA,
 2 April).
 In contrast, Shelest avoided praising Brezhnev's report.
 Additionally, Moscow Fir~+ Secretary Grishin--who often has led
 in praising Brezhnev--was relatively reticent on this occasion.
 COLLECTIVITY    The subject of '.,ollectivity was raised by Brezhnev
 DISCUSSED       himself in his report and also by his supporters
 Kunayev and Ra;3hidov (who asserted that the
 Politburo's work was characterized by collectivity), as well as
 by Mzhavanadze.  Brezhnev, while warning against leaders abusing
 their power, argued the need to combine collective leadership
 with "personal responsibility" and cited Lenin to the effect
 that responsibility for a specific task must be placed on a
 specific person. Mzhavanadze also noted the need to combine
 collectivity with personal responsibility and acknowledged that
 the Politburo's work, Central Committee plenums, and statements
 in Brezhnev's report indicate "that now, in connection with new,
 more complicated tasks, the role and responsibility of a leader
 is immeasurably growing."  This--Mzhavanadze continued--is
 precisely why a responsible leader "must always and in every-
 thing" be an example in observing discipline and "listen attentively
 to criticism, not ignore it but draw the necessary conclusions
 therefrom" (PRAVDA, 2 April).

 PAKISTAN
 PODGORNYY DECRIES BLOODSHED; PEKING OBSCURES DISORDERS
 After Soviet media had for a month carefully straddled the fence
 on the Pakistan domestic crisis, counterposing West Pakistan
 reports of "normalcy" to Western news agency reports of fighting
 and deaths, Moscow took an official position in a 3 April message
 from President Podgornyy to President Yahya Khan expressing the
 Soviet people's concern at the "continuation of repressive mea-
 sures and bloodshed" in East Pakistan and appealing to Yahya for
 "a peaceful political settlement."  On the same day, Peking came
 out with its first, belated acknowledgment of the existence of a
 troubled situation in Pakistan, citing a Yahya speech mentioning
 "secessionist elements" who had attacked the country's "integrity"
 but nowhere specifying that there had been bloodshed cr even
 disorders.
 Gino-Soviet politicking in the troubled waters of Indian-Pakistani
 relations seemed an element in the reactions from both Moscow and
 Peking.  Soviet media have publicized warm Indian approval of the
 Podgornyy message.  The thrust of Peking's sole report is that
 Indian interference and "subversion" are to blame for exacerbating
 the Pakistan crisis.
 PODGORNYY     Podgornyy's message to Yahya, carried by TASS on the
 MESSAGE       3d and broadcast widely in foreign beams, registered
 concern over "the numerous casualties, sufferings,
 and privations" being caused in East Pakistan by the use of armed
 force, with caveats contrived to ward off any charges that the
 Soviet Union was meddling in Pakistan's internal affairs.  Podgornyy
 said his words were coming from "true friends" and were "guided by
 the generally recognized humanitarian principles recorded in the
 universal declaration of human rights," by concern for the welfare
 of "the friendly people of Pakistan," ^nd by a belief that a "peace-
 ful political settlement" %iould meet the interests "of the entire
 people of Pakistan" and of "preserving peace in the area."  He
 expressed the Soviet Union's "great alarm" at the breakdown of the
 Dacca talks between Yahya and East Pakistan leader Mujibur Rahman and
 at the use of "repressive measures and bloodshed" by Yahya's military
 administration; and he called for "urgent measures" to stop the
 bloodshed and repression and to return to methods of a peaceful
 political settlement.

 The message carefully skirted acknowledgment of the underlying
 issue of East Pakistani secessionist aspirations and retained.
 elements of balance--and future options, depending on events--
 in the Soviet position.  Thus the call for a political settle-
 ment in the interests of "the entire Pakistani people"was
 ?             balanced by recognition, in a passage deploring the "arrests
 and persecution" of Mujibur Rahman and other East Pakistan
 politicians, that they had received "convincing support from
 the overwhelming majority of the population of East Pakistan
 in the recent general elections."
 The break in Moscow's stance of aloofness was foreshadowed by
 a TRUD article, broadcast in English to South Asia and in
 Bengali, the day before the message was released.  Relying
 heavily on "alarming" Western news reports of "bloody clashes"
 in East Pakistan, TRUD asserted tha'; the Soviet public was
 "worried by the cruel measures bein; taken against the East
 Pakistani population."  Anticipating the approach taken in the
 message, it noted that Mujibur's "influential" Awami League had
 received 167 of the 314 seats in the assembly and contended
 that "force and repression will not help solve the problems
 facing the country," which can only be settled "by political
 means. I
 Podgornyy's message appears to have been publicized in part with.
 an eye toward the Indian position on the East Pakistan situation.
 Moscow's domestic service reported on the 5th that the message
 h~id been "greeted in India with great approval" and that the
 Indian central press had stressed that the Soviet Union "ft the
 only big power which has called for a cessation of the fratricidal
 conflict."  Monitt'red Muscow tuediR. have not reported any
 Pakistani reaction to the Podgornyy message.
 EARLIER COVERAGE     Following Yahya K'han's 1 March speech announc-
 IN MOSCOW MEDIA                                ing postponement of the convocation of the
 newly elected National Assembly, originally
 slated for 3 March, Soviet media limited their coverage of the
 ensuing Pakistan domestic crisis to brief, scattered factual
 reports on such developments as the strike initiated by the Awami
 League and the Mujibur-Yahya talks in Dacca.  Soviet comment on
 the 23 March anniversary of Pakistan's independence contained no
 substantive discussion of the crisis; one TASS commentary on the
 22d merely noted that talks were being held in Dacca "on the
 future constitutional system of the country."

 2G
 After the breakdown of the Dacca talks and the outbreak of war-
 fare in East Pakistan on 26 March, Moscow duly reported Yahya's
 speech reasserting military conLrol over East Pakistan, prohibiting
 biting all political activities, and accusing Mujibur of treason.
 Subsequently Moscow cited "conflicting reports" of the situation,
 balancing official West Pakistan reports of "normalcy" and "full
 control" in East Pakistan with Western news agency reports of
 "fierce fighting" and bloody repression of East Pakistanis by
 the West Pakistan military forces.
 PEKING     Peking media have not acknowledged the existence of
 civil war in East Pakistan, and Chou En-lai's 22 March
 message to Yahya on Pakistan National Day made no allusion to any
 untoward situatior, in Pal?:istan.  Peking's first and to date only
 mention of East Pakistani events was in a 3 April NCNA report,
 based on both Pakistani and Indian as well as Western sources, of
 three Pakistan Government notes to the Indian Government on
 alleged Indian interference in Pakistan's internal affairs.  r+CNA
 quoted passages from Yahya's 26 March speech referring to the
 "grave situation" in the country, to the "very serious turn" of
 recent events in East Pakistan, and to "anti-Pakistan and seces-
 sionist elements" who have "attacked the solidarity and integrity
 of this country."
 NCNA used selected quotations from Western and Indian news
 agency reports of Indian comment to depict active Indian inter-
 ference in East Pakistan.  For example, it cited a 31 March PTI
 report that Indira Gandhi had tabled a resolution in Parliament
 stating that India  "cannot remain indifferent" to the East
 Pakistani situation and calling on governments of the world to
 take steps--as NCNA put it--"to interfere in the internal affairs
 of Pakistan."  NCNA noted that the Indian iovernment "is also
 reported to be encouraging Indian nationals to intrude into
 Pakistan territory for subversive purposes."
 In thus limiting its reaction to an account focused on alleged
 Indian interference, Peking has expressed support for the
 Pakistan Government in the international community while
 refraining from comment on the internal conflict.  The NCNA
 report took note of reported Indian efforts to enlist support
 from the United States and the St:riet Union and within the
 United Nations in behalf of common steps regarding the East
 Pakistan situation.  By attacking outside interference, Peking
 has updated its line of support for Pakistan in the context
 of South Asian affairs.

 PRC  INTERNAL AFFAIRS
 NEW PARTY COMMITTEES ANNOUNCED FOR HUPEH AND FUKIEN
 Quickening the pace, NCNA reported the formation of a new party
 committee for Hupeh on 31 March and one for Fukien on 6 April.
 Six such announcements were made during March compared with
 two in February, four in January, and four last December.
 Seventeen of the PRC's 29 major administrative units now
 claim new provincial committees.
 With the formation of new committees for        and Fukien, the
 Wuhan Military Region (MR) and the Foocho       come the third
 and fourth military regions to set up commit    for all.
 provincial units within their jurisdiction     le Nanking LvIR
 led by Politburo members Hsu Shih-yu and Ci.    hun-chiao,
 reached this stage in January, followed by      Canton MR,
 Huang Yung-sheng's old stronghold, in late February.
 HUPEH          The Hupeh committee was formed at a party congress
 COMMITTEE      meeting in Wuhan from 23 to 28 March.  Officers
 from the Wuhan MR dominate the seven-man leader-
 ship group which heads the new committee of 80 full and 23
 alternate members.
 The top two positions on the committee went to military men
 who moved into the Hupeh power :structure after the Wuhan
 Incident of July 1967.  Tseng Ssu-yu, the new first secretary,
 moved from Y's chief of staff post in the Shenyang MR to
 replace Chen Tsai-tao in July 1967 as commander of the
 Wuhan MR, a position he continues to hold.  Tseng is also
 chairman of the revolutionary committee.  Liu Feng, named
 second secretary on the new committee, hcs been based in
 Hupeh since 1958.  Identified only as an air force officer
 for several years, Liu was promoted to his concurrent post
 of first political commissar of the Wuhan MR just after
 the Wuhan Incident.  Liu is also a vice-chairman of the
 revolutionary committee.

 Of the five men named as secretaries, all but one have a formal
 connection with the military power structure in Hupeh.  Chang
 Ti-hsueh is also first political commissar of the I Iupeh Military
 District and holds a concurrent vice-chairmanship.  Prior to
 the cultural revolution, Chang was the provincial governor and
 acting first secretary of the old provincial party committee.
 Kung Ching-teh  is also deputy commander of the Wuhan MR while
 both Pan Chen-wu and Chang Yu-Ima are deputy political commissars
 within the MR.  Chiang Yi, a former secretary on the previous
 party committee and a standing committee member on the
 provincial revolutionary committee, is the only new secretary
 without a concurrent link to the military apparatus in Hupeh.
 Tseng's keynote address to the congress gave more attention
 than usual to thc' "armymen" in the province whom he portrayed
 as responsible for the "excellent situation in revolution
 and pr,iduction" within Hupeh.  While members of the PLA
 were applauded for success in carrying out their civilian
 tasks, "leading cadres ac all levels," were asked to
 increase their study of Mao's Thought in order to strengthen
 the centralized leadership of the party.
 A joint HUPEH DAILY-YANGTZE DAILY editorial, broadcast by
 Wuhan radio on 1 April, welcomed the new committee but
 cautioned that we "must not think that everything will be
 all right once the CCP committee has been set up."  The
 party's leadership should be strengthened, the editorial
 argued, by paying increased attention to the "building of
 leading groups" and by "unfolding a self-education movement"
 aimed at arrogance and complacency among party members.
 FUKIEN         The Fukien committee was selected at a party
 COMMITTEE      congress attended by 977 delegates meeting in
 Foochow from 30 March to 3 April.  A seven-
 man leadership group, composed of four military iron and
 three civilians, heads the new committee consisting of 75
 full and 18 alternate members.
 The top spot on the committee went to Han Hsien-chu, chairman
 of the revolutionary committee and commander of the Foochow
 MR, who was named first secretary.  Chou Chih-ping, a full

 Central Committee member and a former vice-minister of
 metallurgy identified as a responsible person within Fukien
 military units in April 1970, was named second secretary.*
 Five secretaries were named.  Chu Shao-ching is a responsible
 person with the Fukien PLA units.  Ni Nan-shan, making his
 first Fukien public appearance, has apparently been
 transferred from Kiangsi where he was listed as a responsible
 person with local PLA units.  Three vice-chairmen, Huang
 Ya-kuang, Cho Hsiung, and Tan Chi-lung, were named as
 secretaries.  Huang was affiliated with the People's Bank of
 China until the early '60's, after which he returned to his
 native Fukien.  Cho is a newcomer to Fukien, first appearing
 in February 1970.  Tan, also new to Fukien, first appeared
 in the province in October 1970 and was later identified as
 a vice-chairman.  Prior to the cultural revolution, Tan was
 the first secretary of the Shantung committee.  He failed to
 appear publicly during the cultural revolution but emerged
 at the Ninth Party Congress as an alternate member of the
 Central Committee.
 Han made the usual address to the congress, routinely calling
 for greater unity and avoidance of interference from either
 "right" or "left" in carrying out future tasks.  Echoing
 themes also contained in the keynote speeches of first
 secretaries in the other border provinces with new committees,
 Hen called for strengthening militia work within Fukien--
 "the Southeastern gate"--in order to prepare for war and
 "contribute to the liberation of Taiwan province."
 PROGRESS      A party committee for Shantung appears in the
 ELSEWHERE     offing.  On 1 April Tsinan radio claimed
 success in rebuilding "most" of the basic-level
 party units and establishing party committees for "nearly
 half" of the counties and municipalities within the province.
 Similar sweeping claims were made earlier this year by
 sevoral provinces Just before their new committees were
 announced.
 *  Four of the last five provincial-level party committees
 to be announced have named a second as well as a first
 secretary.  In the case of the first 12 such committees to
 be established, only two--Shanghai and Liaoning--utilized
 this bureaucratic device.

 7 APItTL 1977.
 Shantung, the only East China province that has not yet formed
 its party committee, was a revolutionary vanguard during the
 cultural revolution under its chief Wang Hsiao-yu.  Wang's
 relationship with some PLA leaders was unsatisfactory, however,
 and shortly after being elected to the Ninth Central Committee
 he dropped from public view.  His last public appearance was
 on 1 October National Day in 1969, and even that appearance
 came after an abr,ence of several months following early May
 post-congress appearances in Peking.  In the interim no acting
 chairman has been named for Shantung.
 The recent reemergence of Hsieh Fu-chih as Peking chief indicates
 that Wang cannot be counted out.  Should he reappear as first
 secretary it would not necessarily indicate a radical
 resurgence over the PLA,  however.  For whatever reason,
 whether from weakness or strength, Peking seems to attach
 considerable importance to retaining revolutionary committee
 chairmen as provincial party chiefs and has done so in all
 17 instances to date.
 The formation of new lower-level committees continues through-
 out China.  Most notable of those formed during the past week
 is the Urumchi Municipal CCP Committee; Sinkiang Chairman
 Lung Shu-chin was identified as leader of the regional core
 group when he addressed the municipal congress.  Sinkiang
 clearly leads Inner Mongolia and Tibet as the most likely
 autonomous region to next form a party committee; Kwangsi
 formed its committee in February.
 PEKING NAMES CHI PENG-FEI ACTING FOREIGN MINISTER
 NCNA's identification of Chi Peng-fei as PRC acting foreign
 minister in its report on the 1 April signing of a PRC-
 Mauritanian economic agreement is the first confirmation in
 Peking media that Chi holds that title.  Moscow had called Chi
 the acting Foreign minister in its 23 March report on a meet-
 ing between Chou En-tai and Soviet representatives in Peking.
 There is a precedent for Peking's identification of an acting
 minister during the ongoing rebuilding of the State Council:
 Lin Hai-yun as acting minister of foreign trade, in 1970.
 However, Lin was not destined to acquire full title to the
 position.  Late last year, Peking reported that Pai Hsiang-kuo
 had become foreign trade minister.
