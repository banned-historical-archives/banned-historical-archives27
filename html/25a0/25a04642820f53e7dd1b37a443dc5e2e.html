 No doubt some kind. of simulated cease-fire will b;
 patched up in Vietnam, and probably before the end
 of the year; failure to achieve anything would be too em.
 barrassing for the Administration. It will be a militar,
 stand-still without a political foundation or, in propel
 bureaucratese, infrastructure. So it is quite natural that.
 in an adaptation of Clausewitz's famous saying, it wily
 be war carried on by other means. A recent report from
 Saigon by George McArthur, headlined in the Los Angele.
 Times: "Vietnam Future: U. S. Planners Thinking Big,"
 gives a printout of the future.
 McArthur leads off his dispatch with the not very
 surprising news that, while the negotiations proceed bc-
 fits and starts in Paris, U. S. bureaucrats in Saigon "arc
 confidently using the time to blue-print empires in South;
 Vietnam." Some of them have acquired villas there; they
 find the climate congenial, and would like to stay on,
 enjoying the good life to which they have grown accus-
 tomed. It is impossible to get any accurate estimate
 of how many U. S.' civilians are hanging out in South
 Vietnam with some kind of official connection with
 the American Embassy, or the armed forces, or intelli-
 gence, or whatever. else in the way of "programs" may
 be under way. And if that is impossible, how can any-
 one estimate what number of bodies will be required
 to carry on a simulated peace? The only thin- certain
 is that proliferation is under way; the bureaucrats are
 "thinking big." "No single person or headquarters,"
 writes McArthur, "seems to be running the show. Things
 are just growing, strangely enough, in a somewhat
 microscopic replay of the great buildup of 1965." Of
 course, microscopic can turn into macroscopic. The
 planners, at first stunned by Kissinger's forecast that
 "peace" was close at hand, are regaining their vigor and
 redoubling their efforts. They intend to stay on.
 Clothes may not make the man, but they can make
 him look different, and -by all indications such transfor-
 mations will be taking place on a large scale. It takes
 only a few minutes and some pieces of paper to change
 a colonel in uniform into a civilian bureaucrat in color-
 ful sport shirt and slacks. Or he may be nominally a
 civilian already, a Central Intelligence Agency type, striv-
 ing to win the hearts and minds of the people. In ad-
 dition to CIA, AID, CORDS and other organizations
 whose full names are rarely used, the United States now
 has four consulates in South Vietnam. McArthur pre-
 ' diets that these peace-loving, offices, complete with mili-
 tary attaches, State Department political ofncers, CIA
 operatives, et at., will be installed permanently 'at Can
 gress may want to be in at the finish. Constitutionally,
 this is no simple matter. Since we do not recognize North
 Vietnam, except for the purposes of killing and bombing,,
 an agreement with Hanoi would not be a treaty and the
 Senate would have nothing to say about it. But we do
 recognize South Vietnam, so if they sign, wouldn't that
 constitute a treaty? Some lawyers think so, but it is a safe
 bet that President Nixon will not. As Commander in Chief
 he can order a cease-fire at his pleasure.
 Sen. J. William Fulbright thinks an agreement to end
 the war should be submitted to the Senate for its scru-
 tiny. But the Senate wants a cease-fire and will doubt-
 less be reluctant to appear to be meddling in the inter-
 minable negotiations. All the same, the time will come
 when the Senate must insist on -a say. "I would assume,"
 Senator Fulbright observes, "any agreement would in-
 volve obligations to spend several billions of dollars, a
 commitment that should be submitted to the' Congress."
 And. further, "with these secret agreements, we find so
 often that they. have obligations on our treasury or to
 send troops abroad, so it seems only fair that Congress.
 have a chance to examine them." If Congress hopes to
 maintain some degree of control over what happens in
 Vietnam after a cease-fire, it should note what is happen-
 ing there now. The bureaucrats are "thinking big" and
 will no doubt set programs in motion without initial
 Congressional approval, and then, as in the past, gamble
 that they can induce the Senate and House to continue
 and even expand them. So the time for vigilance is now.

 LOS ANGELES TIMES
 13 DEC 1972
 uildup in Vietnarn
 President Nixon has reduced the .American mili-
 tary forces in Vietnam from almost 600,000 in the
 first months of his Presidency to 25,200. The num-
 ber now is frozen pending clarification of where the
 Paris peace talks are going. But the remaining
 :.troops are organized for withdrawal on a 57-day
 -schedule to conform with the 60-day limit written
 into the nine-point peace plan tentatively agreed on
 . =two months ago.
 At the same time, the United States is quietly and
 -slowly building up its civilian forces in South Viet-
 nam, actively recruiting additional personnel, re-
 portedly authorizing the transfer of some soldiers
 to civilian status, alerting Indochina experts now in
 other posts that they soon may be sent, to Vietnam.
 Unofficial estimates indicate that a civilian force of
 as many as 10,000 Americans is being prepared for
 Vietnam.
 There is no official explanation because, official-
 ly, there is only a denial of such a buildup. But it is
 clear from some of the categories being recruited
 .that the new band of Americans in mufti will be
 doing in the future some of the things that Ameri-
 cans in uniform are doing now, including such
 -tasks as operating computers for the Saigon milita-
 ry command, advising troops in action, repairing,
 servicing and perhaps flying combat and transport
 aircraft, and assisting with espionage and sabo-
 1age.
 To put it bluntly, there is evidence that the
 'American government has no intention of ending
 American involvement. in Indochina, that it is only
 working to convert the involvement to the form
 that prevailed before the massive buildup and di-
 -sect battlefield role of 1965 and 1966.
 If this is the intention, it is time for Mr. Nixon to
 be very clear about it. It must be explained. It must
 -be debated. The ultimate decision must represent
 the will of Congress, a national consensus.
 As matters now stand, we know of no good rea-
 _
 son to justify the buildup.
 Of course, it can be argued that there are not
 enough skilled Vietnamese to operate the sophisti-
 cated weapons and instruments of war that were
 given.them by the United States. But the point is
 that peace, not war, is to be' waged now.
 Of course, it can be argued that President Nguy-
 en Van Thicu will be weaker without the Ameri-
 cans, more vulnerable to overthrow, and it can be
 anticipated that there will be cheating on a cease-
 fire, and perhaps no absolute peace for years and
 years. But it is no more reasonable to propose a
 prolongation of the American commitment than to
 advocate the right of Hanoi to recruit advisers
 from Moscow and Peking.
 Aid there must be, aid both to the north and the
 south, a reconstruction of Vietnam, regardless of
 ideology and political commitment, but not aid that
 is a screen to preserve American influence and pro-
 long Amnrican commitment.
 It is not in the American interest to talk, as
 American officials now are talking, of enlarging
 the number of U.S. consulates in South Vietnam
 and placing them just where U.S. Army corps
 headquarters have been operating. It is a travesty
 to suggest that the military attache in the U.S. Em-
 bassy requires "hundreds" on his staff. There is no
 logic to recruiting a 100-man team of Americans to
 monitor the cease-fire unless the United States
 would be looking for an excuse to reenter the hos-
 tilities. It is folly,to leave even a suspicion that the
 reconstruction contractors may be operatives of
 the CIA.
 Mr. Nixon sought office in 1968 and reelection in
 1972 on a commitment to get out of Vietnam. That
 is what the American people understand is being
 arranged in Paris. That is what the American peo-
 ple have shown so clearly that they want.
 They want to get out'not'just because they are
 weary of the war, not just because they now recog-
 nize the madness of the war. They want to got out
 because they now know that this Js not and never
 was their business. It is not for the Americans, it is
 for the Vietnamese to decide the future of Viet-
 nam-the Vietnamese by themselves, not through
 the-mask of a new and clandestine army of Ameri-
 cans.

 By Joan P. R\ocne
 Ever since the Supreme Court held
 that the relationship between a reporter
 and his sources was not privileged (that
 is, protected from scrutiny on the model
 of the lawyer-client connection), there
 has been a great deal of discussion
 abort curbs on freedom of the press.
 This controversy was intensified when
 the Supreme Court held that a Harvard
 assistant professor, Samuel Popkin, had
 to answer a grand jury's questions on
 the Pentagon Papers or go to jail for
 contempt. A  handcuffed  Ponkin  was
 seen en route to prison. (Ile was sub-
 sequently freed.)
 There are two aspects of this problem,
 one of which has been almost entirely
 overloo'.ked.  Understandably, emphasis
 has been placed on the moral obligation
 of a, newsman to protect - a confidential
 source. (Or, in Popkin's case, on the
 duty of a?scholar to safeguard his infor-
 mants.) But very little has been said
 about the inherent dangers - to journal-
 ism as to schola.rshio - of using unveri-
 fiable sources.
 Let us look first at the legal issue,
 which  is  historically simple.  In  the
 American majoritarian tradition there
 were no inherently privileged relation-
 ships. Indeed, the very foundation of a
 democratic order is that every citizen is
 a cop, that laws are enforced by the citi-
 zenry not by the police. This ma or-
 itarianism, which somewhat resembled
 vigilantism, would only tolerate privi-
 leged relationships if they received stat-
 utory approval. Given the role of law-
 yers in politics, the first privilege to re-
 ceive general acceptance was- that be-
 tween lawyer and client.
 Contrary to supposition, the doctor-pa-
 tient and minister-parishioner relation-
 ships have largely rested on custom, not
 statute. Indeed, a case can be made that
 to privide special privilege to the priest
 or minister would violate the separation
 of church and state. In practice it is
 hard to conceive of a grand jury throw-
 ing a priest in jail for protecting the se-
 crets of the confessional. Ilo.vever, not
 more than a year or so ago in New York
 a psychiatrist was forced to testify, the
 state courts holding (correctly) that only
 a. statue could?provide immunity.
 The answer to the press' (and Dr.
 Popktn's) problem then (as the Supreme
 Court pointed out) is an act of Congress
 stipulating immunity for the reporter or
 the scholar. In the meantime reporters
 or professors who choose to protect their
 sources just have to take certain risks,
 and in the process thank God they are
 not dealing with British judges, who
 really throw the contempt power around.
 But what about the other side of this
 matter the growing use of unverifiable
 "confidential sources"? Of course, jour-
 nalists have done this routinely for
 years.
 It is a practice I try to avoid because,
 -having been one, I are suspicious of the
 motives of "high White House sources,"
 who are normally trying to play the
 press like a salmon. Iio;':ever, with-the
 advent of "instant history," we now find
 who're volumes which at crucial evhl ?n-
 tial  points  rests  on  a  "confidential
 source." Or worse perhaps, on no cried
 source wtiatsoever.
 Imagine my interest when, in llerbert
 Para' is "Eisenhower and the A,tnct-i-
 Can Crusades," I learned,  that  "one of
 Dulles' closest confi(lants" had revealed
 that Ngo Dinh Diem was "discoverer!"
 by the CIA and "rammed" into office in
 1954 by John Foster Dulles. Later we
 are told that during President'. Eisen-
 hower's 1955 heart attack. Dulles was
 the "quarterback," that "nothing was
 done without. his approval." This is in-
 teresting because 1) it sounds like Dul-
 les' view of his own role, and 2) it is in
 contradiction to what others have said.
 Good, let's find out - check footnote
 "Confidential source." Thanks a lot.
 Parrnet, however, is a small-time op-
 erator when it comes to "conficdential
 sources." David Halberstam has just
 turned out a 6G.5-page book on the Ken-
 nedy-Johnson era in which a number of
 people are quoted in extraordinary fash-
 ion, and even more non-people (a ":John-
 son aide," a "Kennedy confidant," etc.)
 turn up saying the strangest (hat siag-
 ularly useful from Ilalberstam's vicw,v-
 point) things. There is not a single foot-
 note in the book! I suppose if you can't
 heat 'em, join 'em: Did I ever tell you
 how Jack Kennedy told me never to-be-
 lieve anything ken Galbraith said?

 Q'I 11, 11 ull!
 tho victor marchetti story
 by fames Otis
 "I'm a scoutmaster"
 Marchetti. lie is, in fact,
 scoutmaster.
 says Victor
 more than a
 Until 1969 he was executive assis-
 tant to the deputy director of Central
 Intelligence, Admiral Rufus Taylor.
 More recently, he has beer' the subject
 of a legal case which could crack open
 the darkest recesses of America's clan-
 destine government. "I am the kind
 of a guy who manages Little League
 teams," he goes on. "Well, my scouts
 and ball players began to grow up on
 me and they became draft age. They
 let their hair grow; they changed. Now
 I know these were good boys, and
 they started to get to me. They began
 saying, 'I'm not going to go and get
 shot in Vietnam, because it's an unjust
 war.' " Doubts, gnawing doubts about
 Vietnam and the CIA's role in foreign
 affairs. Ile -says that he saw himself
 becoming a lifer, an intelligence bu-
 reaucrat., and he "didn't want to play
 the game any longer." After 14 years
 as a spy for America, Marchetti quit.
 That was 1969. Now, in August,
 1972, in Washington, D. C., he sat in a
 Chinese restaurant . known as a place
 frequented by CIA agents. Far from
 the taciturn and glamorous killer, Mar-
 chetti looked stolidly middle class, of
 conservative  mien  and  talkative
 manner. As he spoke, lie furtively
 sized up the occupants of the other
 tables and mentally chronicled the
 M             Fs?.i      ?PF
 if I was at the Agency. I was going to
 dinner parties ... we'd sit around and
 talk. In fact, I saw as much of Agency
 people as I did when I was working."
 But somewhere along the line he
 got the notion that he wanted to blow
 the whistle on the CIA: "I would go
 down to a shopping center and walk
 around. For the first time in 15 years,
 I began to look at a check-out clerk as
 a human being, instead of a check-out
 clerk. I got interested in people and
 my ideas about the Agency became
 firmer and sharj)er, and I began to
 written book with his literary agent,
 publishers, or wife. It is an injunction
 of unprecedented scope-never before
 has the government gone to court to
 prevent former employees from speak-
 ing or writing. At the heart of the case
 lies a basic conflict between the First
 Amendment guarantees of free speech
 and the government's interest in keep-
 ing a lid on its various clandestine--and
 often illegal-activities. Provoked by
 the wave of "whistle-blowing" atten-
 dant on Daniel Ellsberg's release of the
 Pentagon Papers, the conflict arises
 because of official activity which of-
 fends the moral sensibilities of rather
 ordinary, and very loyal, public ser-
 vants like Victor Marchetti. If the Su-
 preme Court backs Marclietti's right to
 talk, it could open a floodgate for a
 torrent of revelations about the ne-
 farious activities  of American spy
 agencies. If it upholds the CIA', it
 could cut down on the trickle of infor-
 mation which currently keeps the In-
 visible Government on its guard.
 Aside . from the broader implica-
 tions of the case, the CIA has good
 reason to fear what Marchetti himself
 might reveal about his erstwhile em-
 ployers. He is unquestionably the
 highest-ranking intelligence official to
 threaten exposure of the Agency's
 more  questionable  endeavors.  Ile
 knows where the skeletons are hidden.
 Indeed, Marchetti is given credit for
 developing the surveillance techniques
 which led the CIA to discover Russian
 missiles in Cuba and thereby provoked-
 the 1962 Missile Crisis.
 As Marchetti tells the story, "After
 I was with the Agency for five or six
 years, 1 was assigned to the Cuban
 problem. This was exciting and per-
 sonally very satisfying because another
 fellow and I evolved a strange analyti-
 cal working tool which we called
 crateology. With it we were able to
 identify the merchant ships that were
 arms carriers.. Over a period of time,
 since the Soviets were very methodi-
 1 we began to learn which crate
 O  ~QaWd a SAM 2 and which crate
 1Uarchc1li: Blowing the whistle
 focus on precisely what was bothering
 nie."
 Victor Marchetti decided to write a
 book. While the process of writing can
 be a solitary and private experience, he
 could scarcely expect to scribble away,
 merrily  exposing  his  former  em-

 The pending cease-fire agreement, as so
 far disclosed by Hanoi and Washington,
 is like a delicate watch., intricately
 fabricated to make sure it won't work.

 No agreement ever had so many in-
 genious provisions calculated to keep it
 from  succeeding.  If by  chance one
 spring  doesn't break down, there is
 another in reserve that almost surely
 will, and if by some unforeseen mishap
 that one also should work, there is still
 another which will certainly go blooey
 sooner or later.
 The fragility of the agreement to
 end the second Indochinese war is put
 in better focus if one compares-it with
 the cease-fire which ended the first, at
 'Geneva in  1954.  The  only  signed
 document  that  emerged  from    the
 Geneva  conference was a cease-fire
 agreement between the military com-
 mands on both sides. It was accom-
 panied by a . final declaration which
 nobody  signed  and  to  which   the
 United States and the separate state
 the French, had created in the south
 objected; then as now the puppet was
 more obdurate than the master.
 The first Indochinese war ended, as
 the second seems to be doing, with a
 cease-fire but no political settlement.
 The prime defect, the "conceptual"
 flaw, to borrow a favorite word of
 Kissinger's, lay in the effort to end a
 profoundly political struggle without a
 political settlement. A cease-fire then,
 .as  now,  left  the  political  problem
 unresolved and thus led inevitably to a
 resumption of the conflict. It will be a
 miracle if the new cease-fire does not
 breed  another,  a third, Indochinese
 war.
 A  political  solution  was left  to
 inah"ana and "free elections." But the
 -Geneva cease-fire   agreement,   dis-
 appointing as its results proved to be,
 was far more precise in its promise of
 free elections than is the new cease-

 The new cease-fire agreement gives him
 far more power than he would have
 had under the proposals he and Nixon
 made jointly in January. Under Point 3
 of those proposals, there was to have
 been "a free and democratic presi-

 Vietnam  within  six  months.  One

 rhieu's most notorious instrument for
 these round-ups was Operation Phoe-

 hieu terms, was to be taken out of

 electoral commission "organized and

 effort in any free election would be. ment."3
 crippled. Arrests have been ii'tehsified
 in preparation for a cease-fire.
 The fate of the political prisoners
 figured prominently in the peace nego-
 tiations. The seven-point - program put
 forward by the other side in July of
 last year called for the dismantling of
 Thieu's concentration. camps and the
 release of all political prisoners. The
 eight-point proposal put forward by
 Washington and  Saigon last January
 left their fate in doubt. It called for
 the simultaneous release of all POWs
 and   "innocent   civilians  captured
 throughout Indochina." The ambiguous
 phrasing seemed designed to exclude
 po!iti.cals since these were neither "cap-
 .tured" nor, in'the eyes of the Thieu
 regime, "innocent."
 January indicated that  the electoral
 commission would be free from the
 inhibitions of the Thieu constitution,
 under which communist and neutralist
 candidates can be declared ineligible.
 According  to  those   proposals,  "All
 political forces in South Vietnam can
 participate in the election and present
 candidates."
 How      much  weaker  is  the    setup
 under  the  new cease-fire agreement.`
 There  is  no  provision  for   Thicu's
 resignation .before  the election. The
 existing government is no longer ex-

 Taking on' American Tone
 BY GEORGE McARTIIUR
 TIrnef Statf writer
 SAIGON-While  cease-fire  ne-
 gotiations proceed with questiona-
 ble progress in Paris and elsewhere,
 the U.S. bureaucrats of Saigon are
 confidently"using the time to blue-
 print future empires in South Viet-
 ham.
 As of. now, their vision is unset-
 tling.
 Although past American expcr
 fences in Laos and Cambodia can
 hardly be called successful, the plan-
 ners are casually using those coun-
 tries as partial models for the Viet-
 nam' blueprints.. -
 President Nixon's senior
 wordsmith,  H e r b e r t G.  Klein,
 has denied plans to station "either
 civilian or military advisers" with
 South Vietnam's army after a cease-
 fire. He was treading a semantic
 tightrope, according to all the
 evidence in Vietnam. itself.
 The American military population
 has at least temporarily levelled off
 at about 27,000 men. But the overall
 U.S. presence in South Vietnam
 once gain has started to slowly
 'grow. Civilian technicians have ar-
 rived in sit;tlificant numbers and ci-
 vilian contractors are stepping up
 operations in dozens of areas like
 training, maintenance and supply.
 lmpossible to Get Estimate
 At this moment it? is impossible to
 ?get an accurate estimate of the num-
 ber of U.S. civilians in South Viet-
 nam with some kind of official con-
 lnection with the U.S. Embassy, mili-
 l,ary, intelligence or others.
 No single person or heaclquartct?s
 fieems to be running the show.
 Things are just growing, strangely
 enough, in a somewhat microscopic
 replay of the great buildup of 1963.
 No one seems to expect this civilian

 minibuildup to get out of hand. But
 ;nobody has yet said "stop."
 Part of the problem is that. Wash-
 ington has not stepped in to provide
 answers to some specific bureau-
 cratic questions.
 With Saigon's military warehouses
 bulging with liquor, PX goods and
 other supplies for some 30,000 men,
 the supply officials naturally want
 to know "how long?." and, more sup-

 Meanwhile,  the  planners,  who
 were stunned by the mid-October
 revelation that a cease-fire was near,
 have regained their vigor. Having
 been frozen out of earlier planning
 by the secrecy of the talks, they are
 redoubling their efforts.

 Bloodbaths,
 .or allegations?
 To the Editor:
 In his zeal to reassure him-
 self and his readers of the
 soundness of past literature
 on North Vietnam, John S.
 Carroll ("After we get out,
 will there be a bloodbath in
 South Vietnam?", Oct.  15)
 violated  the  first  rule of
 honest argumentation, which
 is to represent with reason-
 able accuracy the text which
 you wish to refute. Having
 chosen my "revisionist" cri-
 tique of past and present alle-
 gations ? of a "bloodbath" in
 North Vietnam as his target,
 Carroll manages nevertheless
 to avoid reference - with a
 single exception--to any of
 the specific evidence which
 I have offered in the two
 publications which he cites.
 I object, of course, to his
 taking out ,of context my re-
 mark that I no longer wish to
 rest my case against Nixon's
 bloodbath allegations on the
 International Control Commis-
 sion reports alone, and using
 it to conclude that "at least
 one of the principal assump-
 tions on which the revisionist
 history rests is not even be-
 lieved by its own author." I
 made the remark: in the con-
 text of a long, fully docu-
 mented study of the North
 Vietnamese   land   reform
 which I was then completing.
 As I explained to him at that
 time, in comparison with the
 evidence I had found of a
 general distortion  of the
 North Vietnamese land-reform
 cjlmpaign in both primary and
 secondary sources available
 to Americans, the I.C.C. re-

 THE POLITICS OF HEROIN IN SOUTH-
 EAST ASIA
 by Alfred W. McCoy
 Harper & Row, $ 10.95
 One fact is beyond dispute: heroin
 .is flooding into the United States in
 sufficient quantities to support an
 ever growing number of addicts. Esti-
 mates about the drug traffic are unre-
 liable, but trends are painfully clear
 in mounting deaths, young zombies
 stumbling through city streets., crime
 to the point of civic terror. There are
 ? said to be some 560,000 addicts in
 America now, twice the number esti-
 mated two years a.go and ten times
 the level of 1960.
 Another fact goes unchallenged:
 suddenly, in 1970, high-grade pure
 white heroin, which Americans prefer
 to the less refined drug more nor-
 mally consumed by Asians, appeared
 in plentiful and cheap supply wher-
 ever there were GI's in Vietnam. The
 epidemic was a vast eruption. It took
 the withdrawal of the troops to douse
 it, for the fearful flow could not be
 staunched.
 Beyond those facts, the sordid story
 of drug trafficking has been a shad-
 owy, elusive mixture of controversial
 elements. It was obvious that there
 must be corruption involved. It was
 obvious that there must be politics in-
 volved, if only because the traffic con-
 tinues to flourish on such a scale de-
 spite the energetic pronouncements
 of powerful governments. It takes a
 map of the whole world to trace the
 drug net.
 Since the United States suddenly
 became aware of the sinister dimen-
 sions of the plague and President
 Nixon bravely declared war on drugs
 (unlike the persistently undeclared
 war in Indochina), it has been cus-
 tomarvv for U.S. officials to pinpoint
 the poppy fields of Turkey and the
 clandestine laboratories of Marseille
 as the source of most of the American
 curse. Nobody denied that the bulk of
 the world's illicit opium (some say 70
 percent, some say 50 to 60 percent) is
 grown in Southeast Asia and partic-
 ularly in the "golden triangle" of
 mountains where Burma, Thailand,
 and Laos meet. But the U.S. govern-
 ment insisted, and continues to insist
 in the 111-page report on the world
 opium trade published in August,
 that. this supplies natives and seldom
 enters American veins.
 Not so, says Alfred W. McCoy,
 who spent some two years studying
 the trade. And further, it is certain to
 become less and less so as measures
 which the United States demanded in
 Turkey and France take effect in
 blocking the old production and
 smuggling patterns. This is of crucial
 importance for two reasons. One is
 that firm establishment of an Asian
 pattern to America means that the
 crackdown in Turkey and France will
 be next to futile so far as availability
 of heroin in the United States is con-
 cerned. The second is that focusing
 attention on Southeast Asia would
 bring Americans to understand that
 the "war on drugs" is inextricably in-
 volved with the Indochina war, and
 has to be fought on the same battle-
 ground from which President Nixon
 assured us he was disengaging "with
 honor."
 . McCoy, a twenty-seven-year-old
 Yale graduate student, worked with
 immense diligence and considerable
 courage-for the opium trade isdan-
 gerous business and the combination
 of opium, politics, and-war can be
 murderous-to document the facts of
 the Asian pattern.
 A good deal of it has been common
 gossip in tawdry bars of Saigon, Vien-
 tiane, and Bangkok for years. But the
 gossip mills of Indochina are a long
 way from the streets of Harlem and
 the high schools of Westchester
 County. The general knowledge that
 the rumors reflected is a long way
 from precise, confirmed detail. So the
 Asian pattern had .never come
 through clearly in the United States.
 Now, in his book The Politics of
 Heroin in Southeast Asia, McCoy has
 set it down. To show how it devel-
 oped, he had to backtrack. The use of
 opiates in the United States has a
 long history. It wasn't until after
 World War I that widespread oppro-
 brium, added to growing understand-
 ing of the dangers, turned the trade
 into an underworld monopoly. But
 World War II disrupted the supply
 routes. Unable to get drugs, Ameri-
 can addicts were forced to quit the
 hard way. The market diminished,
 and, with a modicum of enforcement
 effort and international cooperation,
 might have been wiped out.
 A single U.S. official act, McCoy
 believes, turned that chance around
 and enabled the creation of a world-
 wide octopus of evil almost beyond

 "The next week is the most im-

 told  several hundred  anti-war

 The vigil was scheduled to con-

 committed itself to signing the
 nine-point peace accord.
 In other parts of the country
 similar demands are being ex-
 pressed that the American people
 prevent Nixon from sabotaging
 the chance for peace.
 Congressman Parren Mitchell
 (D-Md.) in a statement to the
 Baltimore Afro-American, now
 on the newsstands, declared, "If

 Many of the Americans were tear-streaked with grat-

 By Richard E. Ward
 A congressional subcommittee has
 Charged the Pentagon with failure to
 investigate charges of war crimes
 carried'out under the U.S.-sponsored
 Phoenix program in South Vietnam.
 The criticism of the Pentagon was
 made in a report by the House of .
 Representatives Foreign Operations
 and Government Information  sub-
 committee, which noted that many of
 the so-called "Vietcong" killed under
 the Phoenix "pacification" program
 were innocent civilians. The report
 also expressed reservations about
 U.S. support  for a  program  that
 "allegedly included torture, rr,urder
 and inhumane treatment of South
 .Vietnamese civilians."      -
 The report, not approved for public
 release by the parent Government
 Operations Committee, was sum-
 marized in an Oct. 3 UPI dispatch.
 According to the news agency, the
 Department of Defense refused to
 ,investigate the charges when they
 were brought to the attention of high
 officials.
 Public release of the cautiously
 worded subcommittee  report  has
 apparently  been  delayed because
 members of the full committee are
 less than enthusiastic about con-
 fronting the issue of U.S. war crimes.
 In July 1971 at the time of hearings
 that constituted the basis for the
 report, two subcommittee members,
 Rep. Ogden R. Reid (D-N.Y.) and Rep.
 Paul McCloskey (R-Calif.) charged
 outright that the Phoenix program
 had. been. responsible  for  "in-
 discriminate killings" and the illegal
 imprisonment of thousands in South
 -Vietnam.
 In September of this year, during a
 hearing before the Senate Refugee
 subcommittee,  a  top  Defense
 Department  official described  the:
 Phoenix. program as an intelligence
 operation. Ile was challenged by Sen.
 Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) in a
 surprisingly   sharp interchange.
 Kennedy asked how the more than
 20,000 "Vietcong" were killed and the
 witness insisted that the deaths oc-
 curred during "military" operations.
 "Intelligence operation'?

 propriations from the U.S. military an

 Assassination teams of mercenaries
 and U.S. agents who compiled lists of
 persons to be assassinated were
 secretly, funded.
 These  aspects  of  the  Phoenix
 program were revealed in testimony
 before the same House subcommittee
 in August 1971 by K. Barton Osborn,
 who served as an intelligence agent
 assigned to provide information to the
 Marines and who also worked for the
 CIA  Phoenix  program.  Based  in
 Danang, Osborn  supervised agent
 House subcommittee heard testimony
 from William E. Colby who headed the
 "pacification" effort from mid-1968 to
 mid-1971. Colby stated that under the
 Phoenix program 20,587 members of
 the "Vietcong" infrastructure" were
 killed from 1968 through May 1971.
 Colby, who had been a top CIA of-
 ficial before serving in Saigon on
 assignment from the White House,
 insisted that the Phoenix program was
 "entirely  a  South  Vietnamese
 operation," although he conceded it
 had been originated by the CIA.
 Colby tried to portray the U.S. role
 as primarily an "advisory" one, but he
 also admitted that  U.S. personnel
 participated in the naming of suspects
 and the capture of prisoners. Ad-
 mitting "occasional" abuses-the
 assassination of civilians-had  oc-
 curred, Colby stated that "we put a
 stop tothis nonsense" in collaboration
 with the Saigon authorities.
 With a facade of candor, Colby's
 testimony actually was riddled with
 lies about the Phoenix program, which
 was  initiated  under  President
 Johnson and expanded by the Nixon
 administration.  Essentially,' the
 Phoenix. program     attempted to
 identify and then assassinate cadres
 of the National Liberation Front, the
 political leaders on a local level of the
 networks for 15 months beginning in
 1967.
 Osborn  contradicted  Colby's
 disclaimers of direct  U.S. respon-
 sibility for the Phoenix program and
 made it clear that U.S. personnel
 participated in murders and tortures.
 He said U.S. "advisors" were really
 directing the program.
 Osborn also described atrocities he
 witnessed, including   seeing Viet-
 namese pushed from helicopters, a
 practice  known  as  "airborne  in-
 terrogations." He also described how
 Marine intelligence offi:ers held a
 Vietnamese woman prisoner in a small
 cage  at  their  headquarters   and
 starved her to death, refusing to give
 her either food or water.
 These and other examples given by
 Osborn provide only a small glimpse of
 the war crimes committed by the U.S.
 in South Vietnam. The atrocities were
 an  intrinsic part  of the  Phoenix
 program directed by the highest U.S.
 authorities on White. [louse orders.
 Obviously the Defense Department is
 not going to investigate these war
 crimes.

 Why No Peace?
 The men most responsible for the continuing carnage
 in Indochina are Nixon, Kissinger and Nguyen Van Thieu,
 whose role is explored in a just issued 108-page pamphlet,
 "Aid to Thieu," by Le Anh Tu and Marilyn McNabb
 of the American Friends Service Committee, 112 South
 16 Street, Philadelphia 19102. Backed by 273 references
 and notes, the pamphlet is a calm account of tyranny,
 oppression and mass murder, carried on with vast
 amounts of American money, military aid and the partici-
 pation of the CIA. The last paragraph of the text reads:
 The demand that the U.S. cease its aid to Thieu
 is reasonable from the point of view of Vietnamese
 who want peace and national independence. It is im-
 perative from the point of view of Americans who
 want to bring this country's expensive and bloody
 adventure in Indochina to an end.
 The Nixon Administration locked itself into an alliance
 with Thieu at a time when that seemed the only alterna-
 tive to military defeat. With his four "no's," Thicu is
 now the principal obstacle to a negotiated peace. Getting
 rid of him is the problem of Nixon and Kissinger. If they
 persist in keeping Thicu in power no other conclusion can
 be drawn than that they are determined to win the war
 militarily, regardless of the moral and material conse-
 quences, to the American and Indochinese people.

 If  the outlawing of  strategic
 bombing is not on the agenda
 of  forthcoming  conferences on
 disarmament, it should be. The
 experience of the United States
 aerial warfare in Indochina con-
 firms the experience of the Ko-
 rean War and the Second World
 War that strategic bombing is
 essentially  a  means of  terror
 and genocide. and that its effect
 on  the military outcome of a
 conflict is minor.
 During seven and a half years
 of bombing Indochina, the U.S.
 Air Force dropped three and a
 half times more tons of bombs
 than  were dropped by all the
 Allied Powers in all the thea-
 ters of the Second World War.
 Yet. a military victory for the
 United States and its Saigon pup-
 pet regime is not in sight, while
 Saigon is now threatened with
 encirclement.
 In both Korea and Indochina
 the U.S. Air Force has had full
 command of the air. Neither the
 North Koreans nor the Indochi-
 nese have been able successfully
 to challenge the U.S. control of
 their air space. although North
 Vietnam's defenses have become
 formidable.
 In both cases. the U.S. Air
 Force slaughtered thousands of
 civilians,  mainly  children.  wo-
 men and the elderly.  In Indo-
 china the extensive use of na-
 palm, poisonous chemical defo-
 liants. and anti-personnel bombs
 produced    biocidal  results. that
 is. the extermination of all living
 things.
 Military analysts draw a dis-
 tinction between strategic bomb-
 ing and the use of air power as
 an auxiliary arm of the army
 and  navy.  The  distinction  is
 pointed up by the contrast be-
 tween the U.S. and British use
 of air power and that of the So-
 viet armed forces in World War
 If.
 Military  historians  note  that
 the Red Army never employed
 strategic bombing. but used its
 cG m Y,.4
 ~?u,-7 ii ti: ~d
 air power for purposes of aerial
 reconnaissance and as a form of
 artillery supporting the troops.
 On the other hand, the English
 and   Americans  cold-b!oodedly
 dropped tons of bombs on heavily
 populated cities. as in the case
 of Dresden. to terrify the people.
 drive the workers out of their
 homes. and hopefully bring about
 a  reduction  in  the nazi  arms
 production.
 Yet. except for the distorters
 of the war's history who falsely
 claim that the U.S.-British alli-
 ance Ivor the war in Europe. it
 is generally known that the nazi
 war  machine was smashed on
 the Eastern Front. And although
 the nazis also employed strate-
 gic bombing with genocidal ef-
 fects against the Soviet Union.
 they went down to defeat before
 the onrushing might of the Red
 Army.
 Strategic bombing fails to dis-
 criminate between civilian and
 military personnel and installa-
 tions. hospitals. churches, schools
 and the homes of workers and
 peasants are wantonly destroy-
 ed. Civilians  who  survive are
 driven in flight to refugee cen-
 ters. Some eight million or more
 Indochinese have now been herd-
 ed into such centers or pacifica-
 tion zones, where they are sub-
 jected  to CIA  supervision  and
 control byThieu's police.
 What is more. strategic bomb-
 ing  has been used  mainly  by
 highly industrialized imperialist
 powers  against underdeveloped
 small peoples seeking independ-
 ence from colonialism and neo-
 colonialism. Nowadays the Por-
 tuguese                                                                               colonialists  are  using
 strategic  bombing.  along  with
 napalm. phosphorous bombs. de-
 foliants and antipersonnel bombs
 pc,lected in Indochina and pass-
 ed on via NATO. Their victims
 are the peoples of Mozambique.
 Angola and Guinea-Bissau      who
 are  seeking  to  throw  off  the
 yoke of colonialism.
 Who knows what small "Third
 World"   country,   striving   to
 strike off chains of imperialism.
 will be the next victim of an
 imperialist bombing attack? Will
 it be South Yemen, Chile, So-
 malia, Burma. Syria, Peru?
 Clearly, it is in the interest of
 the national liberation movements
 of "Third World" countries that
 the bombing of strategic bomb-
 ing should become part of the
 struggle for disarmament.
 To claim, as the Maoists (10,
 that "Third World" peoples have
 no interest in disarmament. is to
 speak nonsense. In view of, the
 growing poverty gap between the
 developing countries and the de-
 veloped industrial countries. what
 "Third World" country will be
 able  to construct effective air
 defenses against bombing raids
 of which the United States. Bri-
 tain. France and even South Afri-
 ca are capable?
 There should be no illusions
 concerning the scruples--now or
 as along as imperialism domi-
 nates U.S. society-of the gene-
 rals and politicians responsible
 for the destruction of life in In-
 dochina. Typical of Nixon was
 his hypocritical call for an in-
 ternational treaty against terror-
 ism at the very moment of his
 escalation of the f3-52 strategic
 bombing raids against Vietnam.

 evert more so. Born in what is now
 South Vietnam, he is remembered for
 his anti-French and pro-Japanese posi-
 tion; his anti-monarchy stand; his co-
 operation with the Vietminh; his long
 exile in Saigon; and his connections
 with the CIA. Although he is currently
 Prime Minister, it is not clear whether
 he is working for the Lon Nol-Lon Non
 combination o.r simply using it for his
 own ends. Apparently he has the back-
 ing of a group of Pltnom Penh republi-
 cans and intellectuals who would rather
 have an accommodation with the Khmer
 Rouge than see Norodom Sihanouk
 back in Cambodia; this group has been
 encouraged by Soviet promises that, in
 the event. of a settlement, Moscow will
 see to it that North Vietnamese and
 NLF forces withdraw and that Sihanouk
 does not return to the country.
 Sirik Matak's position is much clear-
 er. Considered an agile politician and a
 capable administrator  in Cambodian
 terms., he has the backing of business in-
 terests and some sectors of the military
 as well as that of the Americans, the
 Japanese and the French. Because he is
 a member of the Sisowath branch of the
 royal family, the republicans suspect
 him of royalist leanings - if not for
 war from an armchair in Phnom Penh.
 But since he has no political or clan
 backing, he would have to fall in with
 one of the other contenders for political
 power. All Chliloe has little to recom-
 mend him; an adviser to Lon Nol, he
 served Sihanouk in several cabinets.
 Should he be chosen as vice-president,
 the post would be deprived of every ves-
 tige of power.

 Paris: President Richard Nixon wrote a
 personal letter to his Cambodian coun-
 terpart, Lon Nol, shortly after last
 month's National Assembly elections,
 asking the Marshal to nominate a vice-
 president and to include Opposition
 .members in the new government. !';drat
 had already disturbed the White House
 was the fact that Lon Nol had not
 bothered to take a running mate: the
 Cambodian Constitution invests much
 power in the president, and Lon Nol is a
 .very sick man. The Americans were dis-
 turbed further when Sirik Matak and In
 Tam - leaders of the Republican and
 Democratic parties respectively - decid-
 ed to boycott the poll because they con-
 sidered the electoral law unconstitu-
 tional.
 If President Nixon's demand for a
 multi-party government upset the Lon
 Nol-Lon Non duo's plan to consolidate
 their position, his request for a vice-pre-
 sident doubtless gave them splitting
 headaches. Apart from Nixon's need to
 see a more efficient and representative
 govermnent in Phnom Penh, his demand
 for a vice-presidential nominee may in-
 dicate a desire to prepare Cambodia for
 the possibility of a negotiated settle-
 ment to the Indochina War.
 Tile choice of a vice-president and im-
 portant Cabinet figures involves per-
 sonal, clan and party interests: who can
 be useful, who can be trusted and who
 can be manipulated. There would ap-
 pear to be four candidates for the vice-
 presidency: Son Ngoc Thanh, Sirik

 Mr. Cook, a long-tune contributor to The Natioii, is the
 author of many books, including the recently published The
 Nightmare Decade: The Life and Times of Senator Joe
 McCarthy. (Randorm House).
 T
 The. most damning document to come out of the war in,
 Vietnam has now struggled into the light in this, election
 year' It was indeed a struggle:  the disclosures were,
 squelched for years by the highest arms of the American
 bureaucracy; the pith of the message was ignored by the
 Senate.subcommittee, headed by Abraham Ribicofl, which
 exposed the PX scandals; the revelations were verified by
 one of Life's top journalists-and pushed aside in favor
 of the incident on the bridge at Chappaquiddick; the truth
 set forth was . too much for major American publishing
 houses, and in the end was published in Great Britain,
 -coming to the American market on the rebound through
 the David McKay Company.
 This bombshell is The Greedy War, 'a 2.78-page book
 written by the British journalist James Hamilton-Paterson
 and detailing the Vietnamese experiences of Cornelius
 Hawkridge, a dedicated anti-Communist who spent seveal
 and a half horrible years* in Russian and Hungarian prison
 camps before' escaping to the United States. I Iawkridgc
 and Hamilton-Paterson call the war greedy and. the con-
 tents of this book fully justify the epithet. Hawkridge
 ? was born in Transylvania, the son of a Hungarian mother
 and a British father, a. colonel in the Hungarian police
 force-, His passionate hatred of communism and the Rus-
 sians led him into.protcsts and guerrilla actions-and into
 those long years in prison. He came to America believing
 all the dogmas of the cold war and eager to aid as a
 security ofliper in what he considered a holy crusade.
 Paterson writes describing II wkriZf e s MscovericS. "Won-
 dering What limits there Were he asked a Vietnamese
 sfallholder whether he could buy a tank, Tanks are a bit
 difficult right now,' this man admitted, but how about
 sonic armored personnel carriers? Or helicopters, of, course.
 Or how about a heavy-duty truck?"
 What the hell goes on?, Iawkridge thought. And lie
 rushed to' tell American authorities what he had ..found.
 They were' bland, uninterested. Washington, in its holy
 crusade delusion, had concluded agreements with the
 South Vietnamese. that tied the hands of any security
 agent who tried to put an end to the national, pastime--
 wholesale looting. Two provisions were critical: trucks
 could be driven only by South Vietnamese drivers; and
 only 'South Vietnamese police could make arrests. Even
 if an A.nierican security agent like Ilawk idge trapped
 hijackers, in the act, lie was forbidden to lay' a finger on
 tJiem; he had to call in the South Vietnamese police. And
 when they arrived, they simply collaborated in the looting.
 Here, in capsule form, are some of the.things Hawk
 ridge learned and some of his experiences:
 South Vietnam all 'but sank into the sea under the
 weight of the tons of black-and-white television sets,
 radios, spin, driers, untaxed diamonds and oilier com-
 modities produced by a society of conspicuous consump-
 tion and shipped off to Vietnam to win. what must . be
 one of the most curious wars in history.
 .port of Qui Nhon was clogged with shipping, a
 fleet that spread out to the horizon, Some of the. ships
 waited for months to unload; meanwhile. small boats plied
 out to them in the night and' sometimes in the clay; and
 so, when they finally reached a pier, some 60 per cent of
 their cargoes had vanished.
 ?jTlie United States shipped enough cement into South
 Vietnam to pave the entire nation, but there was a chronic
 shortage of cement to extend airfield runways and erect
 facilities.. And the Vietcong always had a 'superabundance
 with which to build their individual bomb shelters.
 T,011 one occasion a truck containing several hundred
 TV sets was hijacked, tracked down in Tu Due and turned
 .over to the South Vietnamese police. I-Hawkridge went to
 reclaim this U.S. property, but was told he would haveto'
 get a Vietnamese driver to take the truck away. By the
 time he hind found a driver, the truck had been stripped
 of its contents right in the police compound.          -
 One night Hawkridge was following a hijacked truck,
 .mystified because the Vietnamese were ripping open pac'i,-
 ages in disgust and tossing them into ditches at the roarl,-
 side.  Hawkridge, kept stopping and picking up the
 pael:ages. They were a consignment of aircraft parts for
 fighter squadrons at Bien I-Ioa. When Hawkridge arrived
 at the air base, lie was hailed almost as a savior because
 ,several jets had been. grounded for lack of spare parts.
 ?Another time, l-Iawkridge chard a hijacked truck
 right into a compound belonging to the South Vietnamese
 Security Police. The panicked driver sped across the com-
 pound,'forgetting there Was a river on the other side, and
 braked to a halt at the last second with the front wheels

 The Dominican upheaval in 1965, in which IIawkriclge
 could not find the Communists President Lyndon B. John.-
 son assured us we were opposing, was the first disillusion-
 ment. Then came Vietnam. Haw.kri.dgc's first day in the
 field there in 1966 was a shocker. Ile had. his nose rubbed
 immediately in the stinking squalor of the refugee camps
 of Qu.i, Nhon. More than 2,000 refugees 'Were living in pa-
 per shacks built largely of discarded American packing
 cases. Three contaminated Wells provided the only drinking
 water. ']'here were no sanitary facilities. "The inmates
 defecated between the rows of paper homes and the slow'
 seep of ordure crept up the pulp walls." Hawkridgc asked
 a priest what had happened to all the USAID. "Stolen,"
 the priest said simply. "It's taken by the ~Iietnamese Gov-
 ernnient.'?
 Hawkridge soon discovered that virtually everything
 was being stolen. Only the smallest trickle of supplies
 and war, materiel being shipped to Vietnam in such
 prodigious, mullillillion-dollar amounts ever reached their
 intended destinations. The Qui N'11011 marketplace, an' area
 of a good-sized block next to the refugee camp, was
 stocked with "C-rations, K-rations, drink, clothing, guns,
 cannons, shells,. cases of grenades, television sets, washing
 machines    the mounds seemed limitless." So Hamilton-

 Saigon under Thieu in 1972 is just like Saigon

 There is one difference, though : anti-Americanism,
 i.e. the disgust at, scorn for, hatred of and opposi-

 and widespread.
 Over the last five or six years of contact with
 GI civilization, "  the  Saigonese  have come to
 realize more fully than ever that nothing can be
 more precious than the spiritual values  of one's
 own nation. Material wealth unaccompanied by a
 spirit of independence and self-respect only leads to
 moral ruin. Many school and college students, who
 formerly liked, believed in, and admired the Amer-
 icans, now turn against them and enthusiastically
 join movements with such slogans as : " Let's go
 back to our nation's roots " and " Let's speak to
 our compatriots' and listen to them." They want to
 cause the stream of the people's strength to gush
 forth even more strongly and to immerse themselves
 in it.

 that after such a long occupation by US troops our

 It hits the nail on the head : many American and
 Saigon soldiers have indeed paid with their lives
 for the consolidation of two wobbly presidential
 seats on either side of the Pacific!
 SOS calls keep coming from Saigon generals in
 Tri Thien, in the Central  Highlands,  in An Lou,
 Binh Dinh and other places. They are so busy fight-
 ing for their lives that they have to put a  tempo-
 rary halt to their wheeling and dealing. The whole
 of that social stratum, which we shall call the
 military-contprador?, brcreaucralic clique and which

 Party, has been thrown into confusion and hetivitd-
 erment: For years, they have drawn comfort and
 support from American mrnfc,- and  troops. Now,
 dollars are coming only in driblets and Ill.-Illy GIs
 have left. The backbone of that clique is now made
 up of  the 13 ptippet regular divisions. But seven
 or eight vertebrae. of that backbone have alreariv
 been smashed. The pillars of the Khaki Party turn
 their anxious  look to  the  Independence Palace,
 Thicu's residence. They know that if Thieu goes,
 nothing can save the lfhrki Party, which has neither
 popular  roots  nor  following,   from  immediate
 collapse.

 IN TIIE MIDST OF WARS:
 An American's Mission
 to Southeast Asia
 by I'sciward Geary Lansdale
 Harper & Row, 386 pp., $12.50
 is, therefore, relatively brief, the period
 it Covets in the Philippines and Viet-
 nam is genuinely important.
 There is only one difficulty with In
 the Midst of Wars: from the cover to
 the final page it is permeated with lies.
 That Harper & Row finds it possible
 to foist such a package of untruths on
 the public-and for $12.50!-several
 months after the emergence of the
 Pentagon Papers, and years after the
 publication  of  other  authoritative
 studies, exhibits contempt for a public
 trying to understand the realities of
 our engagement in Vietnam.
 The lie on the jacket describes Lans-
 dale merely as an OSS veteran who
 spent the years after World War II as a
 "career officer in the U.S. Air Force."
 In the text Lansdale never offers any
 explicit evidence to the contrary. In-
 deed, on page 378-the last of the text-
 he states that at the very lime Diem
 was being murdered in Saigon, "I had
 been retired from the Air Force."
 For all I know Lansdale drew his pay

 graphs in his book attest, he certainly

 close to Ngo Dinh Diem during Diem's

 Times and Beacon editions of the
 .Pentagon Papers (see SR, Jan. 1, 1972)
 as an agent "assigned to MAAG [Mili-
 tary Assistance Advisory Group] for
 cover purposes." The secret report
 refers to Conein's refugee "help" as
 one of his "cover duties." His real job:
 "responsibility for developing a para-
 military organization in the North, to
 be in position when the Vietminh took
 over ... the group was to be trained
 and supported by the U.S. as patriotic
 Vietnamese." Conein's "helpful" teams
 also attempted to sabotage Hanoi's
 largest  printing establishment and
 wreck the local bus company. At the
 beginning of 1955, still in Hanoi, the
 CIA's Concin infiltrated more agents
 into the North. They "became normal

 pursuits, on the surface." Aggression

 Taylor's Swords and Plowshares re-
 cord the statements of defense for
 men wlio& symbolize the two doctrines
 that combined to produce American
 counter-guerrilla strategy in Southeast
 Asia. More importantly, Lansdale and
 Taylor represent two distinct schools
 of war supporters-those who saw
 Vietnam as a crusade and those who
 saw it as a burden.
 Lansdale is America's first expert in
 counter-guerrilla warfare-the legend-
 ary figure who achieved fame in the
 fifties by teaching our cold warriors
 that the only way to defeat Asian
 revolutionaries,, the guerrilla fish in a
 sea of popular support, was to learn
 how  to  paddle  around  a  little
 ourselves. Mixing modern "psywar"
 (psychological  warfare)  techniques
 with James Bond derring-do and the
 kind of cultural savvy that later was
 coveted by exponents of foreign wars
 and foreign aid alike, Lansdale mana-
 ged to position himself for exploits
 and lever-pulling in palaces and rice
 paddies,  Asia's smoke-filled rooms.
 Lansdale's knowledge of the players
 and the bystanders-the French, the
 Americans, the local warlords who
 were beset with kaleidoscopic person-
 al    intrigue-helped    him    contour

 the brass was concerned,
 what really mattered  was
 not who was killed, but how
 many.
 In Hersh's final analysis It
 becomes clear that not only
 was My Lai inevitable, but
 so was its cover-up and the
 cover-up's cover-up. Perhaps
 the most disturbing issue he
 raises is that what made it
 all so inevitable is integral
 to the United States Army
 today. And that raises some
 questions.
 Hersh threads the story of
 My Lai and its sister massa-
 cre at My Khe, their investi-
 gation and the double cov-
 er-up, into a broad tapestry
 tightly stitched together with
 the most damning evidence
 of all-the testimony of the
 men  who  participated  at
 every level and every stage
 of the whole sordid affair.
 Years from now, when schol-
 ars attempt to understand
 the  Vietnam phenomenon,
 "Cover-Up" is the one book to
 which they will all turn.
 And they will ask them
 selves, I suppose, why the
 vital questions  raised  by
 Hersh about an institution
 as powerful in and impor-

 were allowed to go unan-

 SAIGON - In the half-year
 since South Vietnam's presi-
 dential elections ended with a
 whimper instead of a bang,
 this country has been political-
 ly more quiet than at any time
 in recent years.
 The quietness is a sign of
 President Nguyen Van Thieu's
 political mastery, of the de-
 moralization of his opponents,
 and of preparations for a pos-
 sible eventual political contest
 with the Communists.
 And it might also be taken
 as a sign of the narrow focus
 of Vietnamese politics on a
 small handful of people, with
 the bulk of the population
 knowing little about them and
 caring less-in  the normal
 way of underdeveloped coun-
 tries with strongman tradi-
 tions.
 In the offices and villas of
 .those persons who consider
 themselves Saigon politicians,
 there is some desultory discus-
 sion these (lays of new politi-
 cal  alliances.  Thieu might
 once again be interested in
 gathering the support of some
 politicians, instead of spurning
 them all.
 The An Quang pagoda group
 of Buddhists is busy cleaning
 house, the student movement
 is hardly visible, and war vet-
 erans are being taken care of
 fairly well. These are the
 groups that have caused the
 most political turmoil in re-
 cent years, but not now.
 Few Pay Attention
 Retired  Gen. Duong Van
 Minh, the self-appointed savior
 of Vietnam from both Thieu
 and communism, has issued a

 IN TILE MIDST OF WARS. By Maj. Gen. Edward Geary
 Lansdale. Harper & Row. 336 pages. $12.50.
 When Edward Lansdale returned to an almost-defeated
 Vietnam in the fall of 1965, he was already a fabled figure, the
 legendary Asian hand who had been the mentor of the Philip-
 pines' great anti-guerrilla fighter, Roman Magsaysay, as well
 as Ngo Dinh Diem's first American political-military adviser
 in the mid-1950s,
 Although he was then 58, he still had an air of youthful
 Idealism; with his haggard good looks and brown hair only
 tinged with gray, he mi ht have stepped out of the pages of
 Eric Ambler or Ian flaming. One saw at once why he had
 inspired major characters in both "The Ugly American," by
 William J. Lederer and Eugene Burdick, and Graham
 Greene's classic on the Indochina war, "The Quiet American."
 BOOKS
 In "The Ugly American," Lansdale was barely disguised
 as Colonel Edwin D. Hi]landale, a haromonica-playing good
 guy who "loves to be with people, any kind of people." In a
 frankly admiring sketch, the authors wrote, "In 1952 Colonel
 Hillandale was sent to Manila as liaison officer to something
 or other. In a short time the Philippines fascinated him. He
 .ate his meals in little Filipino restaurants   . he even.
 ,attended the University in his spare hours to study Tagalog
 The counsellor up at the American Embassy always
 spoke of him as 'that crazy bastard.' But within six months
 the crazy bastard was eating breakfast with Magsaysay and
 he soon became Magsaysay's unofficial adviser."
 BUT THERE was another way of interpreting Lansdale
 and Greene turned it into literature in his bitterly brilliant
 "The Quiet American." The novel is a despairing portrayal of
 a young idealistic CIA operative who blunders tragically
 through the intrigue, treachery and confusion of Vietnamese
 'politics. Innocent and well-meaning, but naive, the American
 leaves a trail of blood and suffering in his wake.
 Greene's young American was sent to Indochina in the
 early 1950s to help create air indigenous political force that
 could resist a Communist takeover when the French pulled
 out. In May, 1954, John Foster .Dulles dispatched Lansdale to
 Saigon with secret orders to see if anything could be salvaged
 from the fall of Dien Bien Phu. Lansdale became Diem's
 adviser at the time the Vietnamese leader was defying the
 Geneva agreements, which both he and the United States
 refused to sign, resettling almost a million refugees from the
 Communist north: and beginning to make South Vietnam a
 nation.
 ' 1965, It was rather like Ctireene's quiet American coming back
 to Saigon in 1935, it was rather like Greene's quiet American
 coming to life again. Oddly, the Vietnamese started calling
 Lansdale "the phoenix" after one of their household gods.
 What would he do?
 "What does a man do," Lansdale told us at the time,
 "when he returns to a country, 10 years later, with great
 stress on its social and political structure, great suffering,'
 great pain. I have no great plan. One's got to move in with
 tremendous gentleness; these people have been divided and
 hurt and a lot of clumsiness could divide and hurt them more.
 But there isn't much time. They need rule of law, consent of
 the governed in how they are governed and a life in which kids
 have some hope of tomorrow. I feel the Vietnamese are in
 their last quarter. This is the ninth inning and we either do it
 now or not at all."
 He was brimming with plans for sweeping land reform,
 rural electrification, bringing back all the able administrators
 purged for serving Diem, restoring Confucian ethics, putting
 strict restraints on American artillery and air strikes.
 But he was quickly stripped or any real authority. On Jan.
 21, 1965, Philip Habib, now ambassador to South Korea who
 ran the embassy's political ection, sent Lansdale a memoran-
 dum, reportedly signed by Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge,
 forbidding him further contact with the Vietnamese leaders.
 Lansdale the phoenix. Perhaps the Vietnamese should have
 remembered a line of Greene's in "The Quiet American: ".
 "   . but nothing nowadays Is fabulous and nothing rises
 from its ashes."
 "IN THE MIDST of Wars" Is his own discreet account of
 the years in Asia from 1950 to 1956, the brilliantly successful
 four he spent helping to defeat the Huks and elect Magsaysay
 president in the Philippines, the less successful two in Viet-
 nam assisting Diem to unite the feudal religious sects, defeat
 the,gangster army which ruled Saigon and begin a pacification
 effort against the budding Vietcong insurgency.
 It is an invaluable historical document and an exciting
 adventure story, and like the author himself, rugged, humor-
 ous, compassionate, baffling, naive and a little infuriating. In
 the book's anti-climactical final paragraph, Lansdale briefly
 notes he returned to Vietnam again from 1965 to 1968, closing
 his book with the cryptic sentence, "But that's another story,
 quiet. different from the experiences described in this book?"
 Why another story? From his personal viewpoint, of
 course, he went back as a civilian in an enormous, disarrayed
 American mission torn by interagency rivalry in a war
 already going badly, and he was never allowed to come up to
 bat. But would his approach have worked if he had?
 The book's final chapter is devoted to Lansdale's belief
 that Irregular war is not just another aspect in the art of
 fighting but is a complex primarily political struggle for
 political ends.
 "Fundamentally," he writes, "the people of a country are
 the main feature on a' battleground of Communist choosing

 .'elected:president despite. the op
 ,Filipino political establishment. In South Vietnam, lie did
 his best to perform the same role in a more difficult situa-
 tion with Ngo Dinh Diem.
 Throughout, Lansdale promoted his belief that deinoc-
 racy on the American model was exportable, desirable,
 and an effective method of countering Communist "peo-
 ple's wars." In his view, the theories of Washington, Jeffer-
 son, and Lincoln were both morally and tactically superior
 to those of Lenin and Mao Tse-tung, and his evangelism
 was unabashed:
 In sharing our-ideology while snaking others strong
 enough to embrace and hold it for their own, the Ameri-
 can people strive toward a millennium when the world
 will be free and wars will be past.
 The Washington officials to whom Lansdale addressed this
 message were, he notes, "not too happy" over it. In the
 sadder and wiser America of tie 1970s, perhaps most
 Americans would not be happy ',:ith Lansdale's sense, of
 global commitment to democratic panaceas. (Yet. the
 Lansdale spirit is not so dated as it may sound, it survives,
 perhaps in more sophisticated forms, among able and in-
 telligent men at the U.S. Embassy in Saigon, and else.
 where.)
 In trying. to realize his ideal, Lansdale was 'ingenious
 and ruthless. Ile was an early student of Maoist military
 theory and psychological warfare. "Dirty tricks beget dirty
 tricks," he writes, and the premise is that the other side
 played dirty first. Thus he writes approvingly of a Filipino
 psywar squad that drained the blood of an ambushed Huk
 through punctures in his neck to terrify the man's com-
 rades of a vampire. Lansdale also recalls his success in
 causing a mass work stoppage in Hanoi at the time of the
 Communist takeover there-through distribution of phony
 leaflets proclaiming a' one-week victory holiday.
 He does not tell all, however, which is probably one
 reason why the book by Lansdale reads less melodramat-
 ically than the ones about him. Through the Pentagon
 Papers, it is known that Lansdale's American agents in
 Hanoi also sabotaged the city's bus fleet at that time to
 embarrass the Vietminh and that American-trained Viet-
 namese guerrillas, the "Hao" and "Binh" teams, were in-
 filtrated into `Haiphong under his direction for anti-Com-
 munist underground activity. It may not be surprising for
 a retired career officer to omit such secret and sensitive
 material, but in Lansdale's case there are grounds for sus-
 pecting that lie may have omitted more than he put in. His
 protests about exaggerated news reports of his activity in
 Vietnam sometimes have a hollow tone.
 Certainly Lansdale's 386-page book is no comprehensive
 record of the U.S. involvement in either the Philippines or
 Vietnam during this period. Neither are there any major
 historical revelations. What does emerge strongly is the
 personal philosophy and style of America's best-known

 American B-52 heavy bombers yesterday made their heaviest attacks in two weeks
 against the northern provinces of South Vietnam. In Saigon, more evidence of political
 skulduggery emerged, in the case of a Saigon puppet general fired by puppet President
 Nguyen Van Thieu at the beginning of the week on the "recommendation" of U.S.
 adviser John Paul Vann
 .
 Gen. Le Ngoc Trien, command-

 his command on Monday by Thieu
 at what was described as a "high-
 level"  military  conference at
 Nha Trang, 190 miles northeast
 of Saigon.
