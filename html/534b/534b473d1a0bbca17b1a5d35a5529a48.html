 KHRUSHCHEV AND THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY .  .  .  .   Page 1.
 The performance of Khrushchev and his bloc colleagues
 at the UN indicates that they view this session of the
 General Assembly primarily as a contest with the West
 for gaining influence among the uncommitted nations of
 Asia and Africa.   The weight of these nations in the UN
 has been increased by the admission of 16 new members,
 and probably one more will be admitted in the near
 future.
 Khrushchev has shown concern that the adverse re-
 action to his bid to revamp the UN secretariat may
 jeopardize his efforts to gain Afro-Asian support.
 He has moved to counter this reaction by linking his
 UN reorganization plan with the popular issue of dis-
 armament.  He has also called for extensive revisions
 in the UN Charter in order to reflect changes in the
 world balance of forces since 1945.  Khrushchev?s
 extreme anti-Western tone probably is calculated to
 strengthen his hand Also in dealing with the Sino-
 Soviet dispute,
 The West retains control of the powerful 21-
 member Steering Committee, which voted to continue
 the moratorium on Chinese representation; the full
 assembly will vote on this issue later   robably
 early in October,

 Fidel Castro?s UN address demonstrated the degree
 to which Cuba has become committed to Soviet foreign
 policy objectives.   He particularly emphasized the

 Finland's association with the European Free Trade
 Association (EFTA) and the related problem of broaden-

 in prospect are economic negotiations with the So-
 viet Union which the Finns believe must be satis-
 factorily concluded before steps can be taken
 to affiliate with EFTA.  Domestic issues such as
 new farm-income legislation may contribute to pres-

 Although Mongolia is the oldest Soviet satellite
 and historically one of the most obedient, there is a
 strong undercurrent of nationalism, and many Mongolians
 probably view economic ties with Peiping as a hedge
 against total Soviet domination.   Mongolia tried in
 July to adopt a neutral position in the Sino-Soviet
 dispute and, although it now has taken Moscow's side,
 the attempt testifies to Peiping's prestige in Ulan
 Bator.   In furtherance of its effort to acquire at-
 tributes of sovereignty, Mongolia has sought to ex-
 pand contacts with non-Communist countries, par-
 ticularly in Asia and Africa.   In addition to the
 bloc nations,  India, Burma, Indonesia, and Guinea
 now recognize Mongolia.

 the world's major net oil-exporting countries.  They
 envisage a system for sharing markets, fixing prices,
 and controlling production.  Although the OPEC's
 prospects for full realization of the plan are poor,
 the existence of the organization constitutes a
 threat Which may make the international oil com-
 panies more cautious in their planning for the
 future.

 will throw light on the alliances to be formed there-

 29 September 1960
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 KHRUSHCHEV AND THE UNITED
 The speeches and behavior
 of Khrushchev and his bloc col-
 leagues at the UN indicate that
 their principal objective is to
 gain, influence axnohg, the umcnanitutt-d
 nations of Asia and Africa.
 Khrushchev's strategy probably
 is based on his belief that the
 admission of 16 new member
 states--15 of them from Africa--
 will hasten what he views as a
 shift in the balance of forces
 in the UN away from Western
 predominance and that this proc-
 ess- will make the General As-
 sembly an increasingly favorable
 arena for advancing Soviet aims.
 Bloc tactics are aimed at
 exploiting those issues that
 provide opportunities to demon-
 strate a community of interest
 between these new nations and
 the Communist world.   Khrushchev
 has decided to make anticoloi+-
 aia1i m the central theme of the
 bloc's case at this session.
 His harsh indictment of United
 States policy, based mainly on
 the U-2 and RB-47 incidents,
 and his renewed advocacy of
 "general and complete disarma-
 ment" are designed to buttress
 the anticolonial line in this
 all-out bid for the allegiance
 of the uncommitted nations.
 Foreign Minister Gromyko
 set the theme in welcoming the
 new member states on the open-
 ing day when he contrasted the
 USSR's readiness to provide
 "selfless assistance and sup-
 port" with thdr~gllegdd,;grudging
 attitude of the Western powers,
 which he claimed regard the
 new African nations as "unripe"
 and "Adolescent". .countries .
 While the West "sighs" over
 NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY
 their admission, said Gromyko,
 the Soviet Union is "'truly
 joyful.,,
 Khrushchev developed this
 theme in his speech on 23 Sep-
 tember when he announced at
 the outset that "one of the
 chief features of this epoch
 and its very essence is...the
 awakening of the erstwhile back-
 ward, downtrodden, and oppressed
 peoples."  He welcomed the new
 member states,  saying,"The coun-
 tries that have cast off the
 burden of colonialism are a huge
 and active peace force,"
 Appeals to Uncommitted Nations
 In addition to his effort
 to discredit the West, particu--
 lar.y ;the United States,  in the
 eyes of the Afro-Asian nations,

 from the UN force in the Congo,
 leaving only Afro-Asian troops,
 and reiterated the USSR's in-
 sistence that the UN must sup-
 port only Lumumba as the "pre-
 mier of the lawful Congolese
 Government."
 Finally,  he proposed that
 the UN secretary general's of-
 fice be replaced by a three-man
 "collective executive body"
 composed of representatives of
 the West,    the Communist bloc,
 and neutral nations.
 Bid to Revamp UN Machinery
 Khrushchev probably had
 three main objectives in mind
 in making this final proposal:
 (1) to win favor with the Afro-
 Asian bloc by proposing that
 the'neutral nations be given a
 position of equality with the
 West and the Communist bloc on
 the UN's top administrative body,;
 (2) to express the USSR's ex
 treme displeasure with Hammar-
 skjold's handling of the Congo
 situation,  inhibit his future
 freedom of action in the Congo,
 and reduce the effectiveness of
 future UN operations of this
 type; and (3) to stake out a
 bloc claim to a larger role in
 the UN which Moscow insists
 would more accurately reflect
 the "actual situation that ob-
 tains in the world today."
 The Soviet leaders have
 long been dissatisfied with the
 UN Secretariat's personnel set-
 up and procedures; they feel the
 Western powers, particularly the
 United States, have a predomi-'
 nant voice and unfair advantage
 in the UN administration.
 It is unlikely that the
 USSR, had? any serious expec-
 tation of gaining early accep-
 tance of this reorganization
 plan or that it intends to
 i.press it to a vote in the Gen-
 eral Assembly.   This proposal,
 instead,  was conceived primarily
 as the opening move in a long-
 term effort to bring about chang-
 es in UN personnel and policies
 more favorable to bloc interests.
 Khrushchev's suggestion that
 the time has come to consider
 the removal of the UN headquar
 ,teas to another country to "fa-
 cilitate the effective work" of
 the organization similarly was
 designed, not as a serious propo-
 sal, but as a means of assert-
 ing the USSR's dissatisfaction
 with present arrangements and
 a desire for changes that would
 reflect the bloc's enhanced
 power and prestige in the world.
 Adverse Reaction
 The Russians seem to have
 been caught by surprise by the
 uproar that greeted Khrushchev's
 attack on Hammarskjold and his
 reorganization plan.   They ap-
 parently failed to appreciate
 that these moves would permit
 the West to counter with charges
 that the USSR is seeking to
 wreck the UN.   Moscow radio has
 complained that "cold war ad-
 herents" have seized on Khru-
 shchev's proposal to distract
 attention from the "more im-
 portant questions" facing the
 General Assembly.
 Khrushchev's subsequent
 moves reflected his concern that
 this adverse reaction threatened
 to overshadow and jeopardize
 his primary objective of winning
 support and sympathy among the
 Asian-African states by exploit-
 ing the anticolonialist line.
 Having failed to gain signifi-
 cant Asian-African support for
 his attack on Hammarskjold,Khru-
 shchev shifted to the disarmament

 issue to justify his proposed
 reforms.   He told newsmen on
 24 September that unless his
 proposal is adopted,  "we will
 be unable to solve the disarma-
 ment question" because it would
 be impossible to have an inter-
 national armed force, created
 in accordance with a disarma-
 ment treaty, under the command
 of Hammarskjold.
 Khrushchev insisted that
 he was not attacking the secre-
 tary general personally and
 that the USSR was seeking only
 "better organizational forms"
 to assure "true peaceful coex-
 istence" and impartiality that
 would protect the interests of
 all nations.   Soviet diplomats
 in New York stressed to newsmen
 that Khrushchev had  made, "no
 formal proposals" and that his
 UN plan was merely a "suggestion."
 On 25 September,  Khrushchev
 assured correspondents that even
 if'his proposal is not accepted,
 the USSR has no intention of
 withdrawing from the UN or boy-
 cotting future disarmament nego-
 tiations.   Two days later,  he
 moved to broaden his position by
 coming out for a revision of the
 entire UN Charter to bring it
 into line with changes that have
 occurred since 1945.   He com-
 plained that when the UN was
 created,  it was dominated by the
 United States, which wants to
 continue to dominate it.  "This
 cannot go on," he said.   He an-
 nounced that the USSR would con-
 tinue to fight for his proposal
 and predicted that the time would
 come when "everybody will accept
 that point of view."
 Sino-Soviet Problem
 It is likely that Khru-
 shchev's preoccupation with.the
 dispute with Peiping played an
 important part in his decision
 to make anticolonialism the
 keystone of his UN position.
 His great emphasis on this is-
 sue seems at least partly cal-
 culated to strengthen his hand
 in dealing with the Sino-Soviet
 dispute,  in which the question
 of the correct policy to be pur-
 sued toward the uncommitted na-
 tions has figured prominently.
 Khrushchev may believe that his
 drive to reassert unquestioned
 Soviet ideological and political
 leadership of the bloc would be
 best advanced by portraying the
 USSR as the fervent champion of
 the "ant i;-9.mperialist forces."
 In this respect,  his per-
 formance at the UN, strongly
 backed by the array of Eastern
 European satellite party leaders,
 can be viewed as part of Khru-
 shchev's sustained campaign to
 bring pressure on the Chinese
 leaders by demonstrating their
 isolation within the 'bloc. F
 party leaders rather than govern-
 ment chiefs had accompanied Khru-
 shchev because there were "others"
 than the Western powers whom
 "we wished to impress with our
 solidarity'."   Khrushchev's
 statement following his two-
 hour meeting with Tito on 28
 September that "we have fully
 come to terms" and that "our
 viewpoints coincide or are very
 close" seems to have been a
 calculated gesture of contempt
 for the Chinese leaders, who
 have long directed their most
 abusive=..attacks against the
 Yugoslav regime.   These demon-
 strative gestures toward Tito
 are another means of serving
 notice on the Chinese that Khru-
 shchev has no intention of
 making any concessions to Pei-
 ping's views.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 29 September 1960
 Sino-Soviet Treatment of Speech
 The great importance that
 Soviet leaders attach to Khru-
 shchev's UN performance is re-
 flected in the unprecedented.
 publicity Moscow has given his
 speech.   Some 400 Moscow radio
 items covering the speech in
 the three days after it was de-
 livered add up to more than
 twice the publicity given his
 UN speech last year and greater
 attention than Moscow has ever
 paid any previous Khrushebev speech.
 Most commentaries focus on his
 proposals for disarmament and
 liquidating colonialism.   Com-
 paratively little attention has
 been given his plan to revamp
 UN machinery and his suggestion
 about moving UN headquarters.
 Peiping, alone among bloc
 countries, has go far made no,
 comment on the speech. The New
 China News Agency issued a 1,600-
 word summary of the speech on
 24 September.   The summary,
 which included all df Khru--
 shchev's major points but con-
 tained no editorial comment,. was
 reprinted in the Chinese press
 and broadcast in greatly short-
 efied form J. domestic and foreign-
 language news programs,
 President'Eisenhowei''s Speech
 In unusual but not unpre-
 cedented coverage,  Izvestia
 published the full text of
 President Eisenhower's speech.
 Moscow commentators disparaged
 it as "colorless," "mere soph-
 istry," "disappointing," and
 "nothing new."  Moscow's most
 favorable comment was  that
 "many people" noted the "entire-
 ly quiet and restrained tone" of
 the speech, but this observa-
 tion appeared only in a talk to
 foreign audiences and was de-
 leted from a home service
 version of the same commentary.
 Peiping reported briefly on
 23 September that the President
 gave "a long speech" and followed
 up later in the day with"a heav-
 ily slanted 1,200-word account--
 twice as long as the TASS ini-
 tial account but much more de-
 nunciatory.
 1isenhower-Khrushchev Meeting
 Soviet officials in New
 York are apparently encouraging
 Western press speculation that
 Khrushchev would favor a meet-
 ing with President Eisenhower.
 The Soviet premier, while con-
 sistently evasive in dealing
 with journalists' questions on
 a meeting, has attempted to
 convey the general impression
 that he would be receptive to a
 US initiative,   Moscow's account
 of UAR President Nasir's address
 includes his call for a Khru-
 shchev-Eisenhower meeting and
 nQtes that Khrushchev was one
 of the first to rise to acclaim
 the speech.  In an interview
 with an Austrian paper, Khru-
 shchev took the position that
 he was still the "insulted party"
 and could not take the "first
 step," but implied that if a
 third party offered to "mediate,"
 his response would be favorable.
 Other East-West Issues
 Khrushchev's UN speech
 revealed no major changes in
 Soviet positions on outstanding
 issues.   His proposal for gen-
 eral and complete disarmament
 in three. phases over a four-
 year period is identical with
 the Soviet plan of 2 June 1960,
 with.the exception that a re-
 duction of conventional forces
 was moved from the second to the
 first stage,  in order "to take
 into account the wishes of the
 Western powers."  Khrushchev
 called for the expansion of
 future negotiations to include

 neutral states.   The accompany-
 ing disarmament statement said
 "all basic areas of the world"
 should be represented, but it,
 in effect, ruled out Chinese
 participation by linking Pei-
 ping's participation in dis-
 armament talks with its admis-
 sion to the UN.
 on Hammarskjold provoked exten-
 sive resentment in the neutral
 bloc--as a Nepali delegate put
 it, Khrushchev made "a lot of
 enemies" by this move.   On the
 other hand,  Soviet disarmament
 proposals appear to have had
 their usual appeal to these
 same neutral members.
 In a letter to the General
 Assembly president on 26 Sep-
 tember,  Khrushchev proposed that
 the assembly increase the num-
 ber of members of the ten-na-
 tion disarmament committee by
 adding India,  Indonesia,  the
 UAR,  Ghana,  and Mexico.  Khru-
 shchev's move disregards the
 fact that the ten-nation com-
 mittee resulted from an agree-
 ment among the big-four foreign
 ministers in August 1959, not
 from a decision by the UN.
 Although the nuclear test
 ban talks resumed in Geneva on
 27 September, Khrushchev did not
 deal with this problem in his
 speech.   However, he repeated
 during a press conference on 25
 September the standing Soviet
 position that the USSR will not
 resume nuclear weapons tests
 unless other powers do so.
 On the questions of Germany
 and Berlin, Khrushchev reaffirmed
 his post-summit position that the
 USSR will "wait awhile with the
 solution of the question of a
 German peace treaty" and seek
 agreement with the West at an-
 other summit conference "in a
 few months' time."
 Reaction at the UN
 Reactions to the major
 speeches at the UN have in the
 main followed predictable lines.
 The reception UN delegates ac-
 corded the speeches of Khruschev,
 Castro,  and Nkrumah has been
 generally restrained, but many
 delegates have privately admit-
 ted their amazement at their
 tone and content.   The attacks
 Hammarskjold's Position
 Hammarskjold's vigorous
 defense of the office of the
 secretary general and his in-
 terpretation of its role in in-
 ternational situations aroused
 a warm response.   Nehru is re-
 ported planning to come strongly
 to Hammarskjold's defense,  and
 other neutral leaders such as
 Sukarno of Indonesia and Koirala
 of Nepal will probably follow
 suit.   While continued Soviet
 bloc attacks will make Hammar-
 skjold's position exceedingly
 difficult, it now seems unlikely
 that Moscow can force his res-
 ignation.
 Hammarskjold's Congo policy,
 although under attack by Ghana,
 Guinea, and the UAR, has been
 supported by other African
 states, particularly the new
 UN members.   Several African
 delegates have criticized Nkrumah's
 militant speech to the assembly,
 and even some members of the
 Ghanaian UN delegation were re-
 portedly deeply disappointed by
 the speech.   The Sudanese for-
 eign minister expressed the hope
 that the UN members will not be
 taken in by "African politicians'
 agitation in support of Lumumba
 --an obvious reference to Nkrumah
 ---as he claimed such individuals
 did not speak for most Africans.

 So far about 16 heads of
 nonbloc governments have come to
 the United States for the UN
 session in addition to Khrushchev
 and six European satellite lead-
 ers.                                                        Of the 15 newly admitted

 CUBA AND THE CARIBBEAN
 Fidel Castro's address be-
 fore the United Nations General
 Assembly on 26 September showed
 the degree to which Cuba has be-
 come committed to Soviet foreign
 policy objectives.   Reactions
 among Latin American delegates
 were generally negative, but
 delegates of some of the new
 African states were impressed
 and struck by Castro's "sincer-
 ity."  A member of the French
 delegation expressed the opin-
 ion that Castro's simple
 language, effective delivery,
 and unsophisticated concepts
 were on a level to make a
 maximum appeal to the "simple"
 Africans.
 United States should expect him
 to provoke a US request for his
 recall as a pretext for a Cuban
 demand that Ambassador Bonsai
 be called home.
 Castro's particular empha-
 sis on the issue of Guantanamo
 follows two public references
 to the base earlier this month,
 one by Fidel and the other by
 Raul Castro,  in which an early
 demand for US withdrawal from
 the base was intimated.   Al-
 though these statements have
 emphasized that any "aggres-
 sive acts" with respect to the
 base would originate with the
 United States, the Cubans might
 attempt to provoke the US into
 an action that could be used to
 challenge US treaty rights to
 the base before an interna-

 agreement, Mobutu has attempted
 to set up an effective ap&liti-
 cal adthinistrative regime.
 The need for attention to
 the Congo's collapsing economy
 was emphasized by the chief of
 the UN's technical mission on
 28 September.   He warned that
 the Congolese leaders were con-
 centrating on politics and over-
 looking the "panorama of disas-
 ter spreading around theme" The
 UN official charged that the
 Congolese ministers were dodging
 their executive responsibilities
 and that it was almost impossi-
 ble to arrange UN aid because
 there were no responsible Con-
 golese officials around to ac-
 cept it.
 Mobutu has not been able
 to neutralize Lumumba, however,
 or to build up a firm popular
 or military base.   With the
 public support of Kasavubu, Mo-
 butu has recently installed a
 commission of technicians,
 headed by Foreign Minister Justin
 Bomboko.

 frontier, Mobutu's influence
 over the armed forces is de-
 pendent on the regularity of
 pay by the UN Command,;  and ele-

 rioted recently because of dis-
 satisfaction with their pay.
 The governor of Leopoldville
 Province, who is generally re-
 garded as a I4umumba :supporter,
 has warned of possible, armed
 clashes in the capital within
 a week.
 Mobutu,.apparently under
 'pressure from army officers, is
 involved in  efforts to  ar-
 range a round-table conference
 of Congolese leaders.   His plan
 appears to have strongest sup-

 to regain power. For his part,
 Lumumba is unwilling to accept
 a cabinet position in lieu of

 Khrushchev,  in his speech
 on 23 September before the UN
 General Assembly and later in
 answers to newsmen, reaffirmed

 and reiterated Soviet charges

 SITUATION
 A three-battalion force
 loyal to General Phoumi's Savan-
 nakhet Revolutionary Committee
 on 28 September abandoned the
 town of Sam Neua, with its air-
 field,  in the face of heavy
 pressure from Communist Pat.het
 Lao guerrilla units.   Elements
 of Captain Kong Le.'s Second
 Paratroop Battalion are also re-
 ported to have been dropped bear
 Sam Neua and may have partici-
 pated in the final takeover of
 the town.
 The present status of
 Phoumi's units is unclear, but
 just prior to the fall of Sam
 Neua they had been reported
 planning to retreat to Muong
 Peun, about 20 miles southwest
 of Sam Neua town,   Muong Peun
 is described as being a good
 defensive position, but re-
 supply and reinforcement of the
 position would be difficult be-
 cause of its relative inacces-
 sibility by land and because its
 airstrip is only marginally
 serviceable.
 The situation in Sam Neua
 is unclear, but it is apparently
 nominally under control`of the
 Souvanna Phouma government.   The
 internal Congo developments,
 however, has been scant over
 the past week.   The one or two
 daily Soviet commentaries have
 echoed Khrushchev's statements
 and charges and have accused
 Mobutu of paying lip service to
 a reconciliation with Lumumba,
 while continuing his UN-backed
 "plottings."
 Pathet Lao officially supports
 the Souvanna regime,  and its
 cease-fire order for all regions
 loyal to Souvanna presumably ap-
 plies to Sam Neua, now that
 Phoumi's forces have been routed.
 Vientiane's control is pre-
 carious, however, and will be
 only at the sufferance of the
 Pathet Lao,  at least until the
 token paratroop force is sub-
 stantially augmented by rein-
 forcements from Vientiane.
 General Amkha, the Vientiane
 garrison commander,  is reported
 to have flown to Sam Neua, on
 29 September to investigate
 conditions there.
 On the same day that Sam
 Neua fell, military commanders
 from both the Souvanna and the
 Phoumi camps met with the King
 in Luang Prabang and agreed to
 a cease-fire between their op-
 posing forces and to a "common
 front" against the Pathet Lao.
 It is not,clcar what effect
 Kong Le's action in dropping
 paratroopers on Sam Neua will
 have on this arrangement.  There
 are grounds for suspecting that
 he may have taken the action
 unilaterally without the approval
 of Souvanna  and General Ouane,

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 EAST GERMANS CONTINUE
 East Germany continues to
 seek tacit acknowledgment of its
 "sovereignty" over East Berlin
 and to exercise its alleged
 rights to control travel to the
 city.
 A new and potentially seri-
 ous  challenge to
 Western rights has
 been the attempt to
 force Western diplo-
 mats to secure per-
 mits before visiting
 the Soviet sector of
 Berlin,  as has been
 the case for visits
 to East Germany. The
 East Germans  are
 claiming that US Am-
 bassador Dowling ac-
 knowledged the re-
 gime's authority dur-
 ing his visit to the
 Soviet sector on 22
 September by showing
 his identification
 documents to East Ger-
 man police.   The East
 German news agency
 formally denied  a
 Western press report
 that a Soviet Embassy
 spokesman had said
 personnel of the three
 Western powers would
 be excepted from the
 permit requirement to
 visit East Berlin;
 this leaves open the
 possibility that the
 regime will attempt
 to bar such personnel.
 to control West German traffic
 to Berlin.  Taking the same
 line the Soviet commandant took
 in his answer to the three
 Western commandants,  the note
 reiterates the charge that the
 Western powers have misused the
 air corridors.   By asserting

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 29 September 1960
 the US commandant's  protest
 concerning East German police
 action against  Ambassador
 Dowling suggests that Moscow
 may be  prepared to back  East
 German efforts to  gain at
 least de facto  acknowledgment
 of  the regime's  authority in
 East Berlin over  Western as
 well as West German representa-
 tives.
 The East Germans have un-
 dertaken minor harassment of
 Western and West German traffic
 to the city in an effort to
 probe for weak spots in the
 Western position.   On 22 Sep-
 tember, a US Army truck was
 detained by East German police
 at the Soviet checkpoint out-
 side  West  Berlin on charges
 the  driver  had violated
 traffic regulations.    Soviet
 authorities At the checkpoint
 backed the East German police.
 Subsequently the  Soviet com-
 mandant in Berlin refused to
 take any action against the
 East Germans, stating that he
 could take measures only in so
 far as Soviet officers and
 troops were involved but not
 in cases involving East German
 repr esent~ht Ives.
 The East Germans are intro-
 ducing without adequate notice
 new requirements for documenta-
 tion of truck traffic entering
 East Germany.   Six West German
 trucks an route to West Berlin
 to be turned over to the French
 garrison were held up at the
 Marienborn checkpoint
 from 17
 to 19
 September and
 their
 drivers
 fined because
 their
 papers
 did not show the end
 user.
 This has not previously
 been a requirement.
 SECRET
 American officials note
 that fines on West German truck
 traffic have been steadily ris-
 ing in recent months, with the to-
 tal. for August approximately
 five times that of May.   The
 East Germans have also legis-
 lated new requirements for doc-
 umentation of agricultural prod-
 ucts in transit through East
 Germany, requiring special cer-
 tification for absence of plant
 diseases.  American officials
 believe these regulations might
 be invoked as a legal basis for
 interfering  with grain  and
 potato shipments to West Berlin.
 There has been no repeti-
 tion of Soviet fighters flying
 close to Western commercial air-
 craft in the Berlin corridors,
 as happened two weeks ago.
 Bonn is now implementing
 a few limited countermeasures
 against the East German economy,
 including withholding new per-
 mits for deliveries of West
 German goods under the 1960 in-
 terzonal trade agreement. Bonn,
 tfioreover , is 'not ~ implement ing the
 1961 in tat zonal aareeder , which

 OUTLOOK FOR MALI AND SENEGAL
 Soudan's decision on 22
 September to acknowledge the
 dissolution of its federation
 with Senegal and to transform
 Soudan into the Republic of
 Mali has cleared the way for
 the two states to establish in-
 dependently their orientation
 in the international community.
 With this decision, the Souda-
 nese abandoned their efforts to
 sustain the legal fiction that
 the Mali Federation still ex-
 isted despite Senegal's seces-
 sion on 20 August.   The deci-
 sion, apparently prompted by
 the UN General Assembly's post-
 ponement on 20 September of ac-
 tion on the disrupted federa-
 tion,'s pending application for
 UN membership, led to the speedy
 admission this week of both Sou-
 dan--as Mali--and Senegal.
 While Senegal's continued
 close collaboration with France
 and the West seems assured for
 the present, the question  of
 neutralist-inclined Mali's or-
 ientation has become more ur-
 gent. Maintaining that France's
 recognition of Senegal earlier
 this month invalidated the co-
 operation accords negotiated
 last winter between France and
 the Mali Federation, the Sou-
 danese have declared the new
 Mali Republic "free of all po-
 litical obligations and ties
 toward France."
 This position suggests that
 President Modibo Keita may soon
 lead Mali out of the French Com-
 munity and demand the evacuation
 of the four bases and approxi-
 mately 4,400 troops which France
 maintains there under the old
 accords and regards as important
 to the containment of the Al-
 gerian rebellion. Keita reported-
 ly stated earlier this month
 that recognition of Senegal by
 France would lead to an all-out
 effort--including a resort to
 the UN if necessary--to force
 the eviction of the French troops.
 On the other hand, Mali's
 essentially moderate reaction so
 far apparently reflects a will-
 ingness to consider possible new
 arrangements with Paris, at
 least in the economic sphere.
 In a statement on 22 September,
 Keita placed his country in the
 same category as Ivory Coast,
 Upper Volta, Niger, and Dahomey.
 These four West African states
 were permitted in August to be-
 come independent within the
 French Community without first
 negotiating cooperation accords
 with France, as the Mali Federa-
 tion had done; following their
 recent admission to the UN they
 announced their readiness to
 conclude such agreements.
 Keita had earlier indicated

 Keita has shown no inclination
 to tie his country closely to
 either. Keita recently expressed
 suspicion  that   Ivory       Coast
 leader Houphouet-Boigny might
 be acting as an "instrument of
 French influence," but he also
 stated that his country did not
 intend to fall under the "trust-
 eeship" of Guinea.
 Keita has also secured a
 promise of financial support
 from Ghana's President Nkrumah.
 In return,  the Soudanese leader
 publicly endorsed Nkrumah's
 pan-African objectives, which
 include Algerian independence.
 Independence on 1 October
 for the British-created Feder-
 ation of Nigeria--whose 35,000,-
 000 people make it Africa's most
 populous country--marks the
 emergence of a state which may
 in time exert a decisive influ-
 ence on African political align-
 ments.  With the unifying force
 of British authority removed,
 the leaders of its three major
 political groupings must subor-
 dinate traditional tribal, re-
 gional, religious, and cultural
 differences, as well as personal
 rivalries,  in the interest of
 preserving national unity.   Each
 of the three largely tribal
 groupings dominates one of Ni-
 geria's three regions; unlike
 most other emerging African
 states, however, no one of them
 is yet strong enough to assert
 its authority over the entire
 country.
 Power at the federal level
 is in the hands of a coalition

 depends, however, on the favor
 of Nigeria's single most power-
 ful personality--Ahmadu Bello,
 the Sardauna of Sokoto and
 premier of the Northern Region,
 the largest and most populous
 of Nigeria's three regions.
 While the coalition seems
 secure for the present, there
 is apparently considerable be-
 hind-the-scenes maneuvering in-
 spired largely by the desire
 of some southern elements to
 squeeze the northerners out.
 Any such attempt--blocked so far
 by the enmity between the two
 major tribal groups of the
 south--would arouse a sharp re-
 action in the north, where the
 Moslem rulers fear, above all,
 domination by the more dynamic
 Christian and animist tribesmen
 of the South.  The appointment

 Azikiwe--one of Nigeria's first
 nationalist leaders and the long-
 time president of the NCNC--has
 already disturbed many northern
 leaders.   Meanwhile, current dis-
 orders in the north appear to
 reflect growing restiveness on
 the part of some non-Moslem
 tribesmen over the region's
 essentially feudal political
 and social structure.
 In foreign affairs, the
 Balewa government, while recog-
 nizing a basic identity of in-

 mitting Nigeria firmly to the
 support of the UN as well as
 active membership in the Common-

 takes account of the neutralist

 the NCNC.   Pledged to working
 for closer ties among African
 states, the government has al-
 CaAMI 0U

 call an early conference of West
 African states and to send a Ni-

 force in the Congo.   Nigeria's
 present top leaders, however ' have
 made no secret of thir opposi-
 tion to the pretensions to Af-
 rican leadership and the "union
 now" ideas of Ghana's Nkrumah.
 Balewa apparently intends
 to delay as long as possible the
 establishment of diplomatic re-
 lations with Soviet bloc coun-
 tries.   It seems likely, however,
 that formal ties will be estab-
 lished immediately with the UAR',
 which has recently stepped up
 its efforts to cultivate northern
 Moslem leaders.   British influ-

 however, because of the employ-

 POLITICAL TURMOIL IN UGANDA
 The renewed drive of
 the traditional rulers of Bu-
 ganda--key region of Britain's
 East African Uganda Protectorate
 and source of much of its eco-
 nomic wealth--to assure their
 political future is creating
 a major new colonial crisis
 for Britain.   London's efforts
 to push constitutional reform in
 Uganda to enable the protector-
 ate to achieve early independ-
 ence as a unified state may
 bog down unless Buganda can be
 persuaded to partici
 pate in the protector-
 ate government.
 The Buganda King
 and his ministers have
 for several years been
 apprehensive over any
 efforts either by the
 British administration
 or Uganda nationalists
 to undermine the royal
 authority.   The King's
 activities have con-'
 tinually frustrated
 British efforts to
 submerge Buganda with-
 in a larger Uganda
 state and have cre-
 ated such cleavages
 within the Uganda na-
 tionalist movement
 fear that the elections planned
 by Britain for next February
 will lead to a popular govern-
 ment and undermine the tradi-
 tional royal regimes.   In op-
 position to the current elec-
 toral registration campaign
 sponsored by the British in
 Uganda, the Buganda legislature
 on 21 September denounced such
 activity.   It also opposed any
 increase in the power of the
 Uganda protectorate government
 to deal: with intimidation of
 that no dominant faction has
 emerged to speak for the Africans.
 Discussions in London be-
 tween Bugandan and British of-
 ficials deadlocked in mid-Sep-
 tember when the Bugandans
 broke off the talks because of
 their dissatisfaction with the
 terms of London's promises to
 safeguard the province's sepa-
 rate identity.   The King and his
 delegation were accorded a
 triumphant'  reception in Kampala
 on their return from London.
 Buganda leaders,  who have
 the backing of tribal rulers in
 three other regions of Uganda,
 voters--a practice frequently
 ascribed to the Bugandan King's
 government.
 On 23 September the Buganda
 legislature,  reportedly carried
 away by the enthusiasm of the
 crowd in the visitors' gallery,
 voted to terminate the region's
 agreement with Britain and ap-
 pointed a committee to set the
 date for independence.   This
 action, along with a decision to
 curtail Buganda's representation
 in the central Uganda legisla-
 ture,  in effect declared Buganda's
 secession from Uganda.   However,
 legislative leaders favor a
 federal relationship with the
 other Ugandan provinces.

 29 September 1960
 Britain is expected to
 react sharply to Buganda's
 moves.   The chief secretary--
 second-ranking British official
 in Uganda--expects a crisis but
 believes  one at  this time
 would be better than a few years
 hence when Buganda might con-
 front inexperienced  Ugandan
 leaders with the choice of
 civil war or fragmentation of
 a new nation.   He has hinted
 that Britain is prepared to
 use the governor's reserve

 powers to remove Bugandan min-
 isters and curtail the King's
 influence.
 On 26 September the British
 official publicly announced that
 London would not permit Buganda
 to change the basic protectorate
 agreements unilaterally, would
 not recognize any secession so
 long as the British govern        25X1
 Uganda,, and would consider no
 constitutional changes at this
 time.
 Xing Husayn arrived in New
 York this week with the hope of
 obtaining through UN mediation
 some sort of redress for the
 assassination of Jordanian Prime
 Minister Majalli, for which he
 holds the UAR responsible. UN
 Secretary General Hammarskjold
 is trying to prevent the Jordan-
 UAR crisis from reaching the
 General Assembly by undertaking
 private talks with Husayn and
 Nasir, and by attempting to
 arrange, in response to a Jor-
 danian proposal,   a  confronta-
 tion of the two Arab leaders.
 Hammarskjold, in addition
 to proposing that both countries
 cease their propaganda warfare,
 intended to impress on Nasir the
 dangers to Middle Eastern sta-
 bility of continued attempts at
 subversion and terrorism. F

 likely,   however,   to agree to

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 29 September 1960
 The King has already re-
 placed almost the entire pro-
 vincial. Cyrenaican Executive
 Council.   He is also expected
 soon to accept the resignation
 proffered by Prime Minister
 Kubar more than six weeks ago
 and to undertake a major shake-
 up of the federal cabinet.
 Many prominent politicians--
 such as former Prime Minister
 Ben Halim--who might ordinarily
 be considered possible replace-
 ments for Kubar now are likely
 to be ruled out because they
 too have been implicated in
 unsavory dealings.
 One likely choice to suc-
 ceed the prime minister might
 be Husayn Maziq, the governor of
 the Province of Cyrenaica.   An-
 other might be Sheik Abd al-
 Hamid Dibani,  the minister of
 justice, who has occasionally
 been acting prime minister.
 Both are, men of integrity, and   25X1
 either could be expected to con-
 tinue Libyan policies generally
 favorable to the West.
 NEHRU-AYUB MEETINGS IMPROVE INDO-PAKISTANI RELATIONS
 Indian Prime Minister Neh-
 ru's five-day visit with Presi-
 dent Ayub of Pakistan in con-
 nection with the signing of the
 much-heralded Indus Waters Agree-
 ment appears to have established
 a  personal  rapport   which
 will  promote  closer  rela-
 tions  between                  India  and
 Pakistan.
 The formal ending of the
 13-year-old Indus waters dis-
 pute removes a major irritant
 in the relations between the
 two nations.   The new agreement,
 along with last year's border
 accord    and continuing contacts
 between the nations' leaders,
 may provide sufficient momentum
 to enable the two nations to
 move on to settlement of other
 outstanding issues, such as
 relaxation of visa restric-
 tions, implementation of
 through rail travel,  and a set-
 tlement of the outstanding debts
 arising from partition of the
 subcontinent.
 Additional lower :level
 talks are planned on these is-
 sues, but since each country
 feels  that  it  made  the  con-
 ciliatory  gestures  that                                                                  paved

 TRIBAL UNREST ALONG THE AFGHAN-PAKISTANI BORDER
 Tension is mounting along
 the Afghan-Pakistani frontier
 following the outbreak of fight-
 ing among Pushtoon tribes liv-
 ing along the border north of
 the Khyber Pass.   The danger of
 clashes between Afghan and Paki-
 stani army units will increase
 as both Kabul and Rawalpindi
 take measures to support their
 tribal partisans, although ef-
 forts will probably be made to
 keep the disturbances localized.
 The current unrest involves
 long-standing conflicts among
 several tribal groups in this
 area and between the tribes and
 the two governments.   Neither
 government controls all the
 tribes in its own territory, and
 both governments compete- to ex-
 tend their influence among them,
 with little regard for the inter-
 national boundaries.
 Most of the recent fighting,
 which began in early September
 on the Pakistani side of the line,.
 seems to be centered in Khar,  in
 the Bajaur region.  The Nawab of
 fair, a local ruler who controls
 a semi-autonomous state, has had
 chronically poor relations with
 the Pakistani Government and
 reportedly has recently request-
 ed Afghan Government support.
 The Afghans, possibly in re-
 sponse to this request, apparent-
 ly are assisting the enemies of
 the Khan of Khar, a rival of the
 Nawab.
 Kabul has canceled all army
 leaves, is calling up reserv-
 ists,.                                                                and is sending additional
 armor and infantry units to the
 border, both north and south of
 the Khyber Pass.  The Afghan
 Government is also recruiting
 tribal irregulars, and many--
 perhaps a thousand--have already
 crossed the border to spark fur-
 ther unrest and encourage tribal
 opposition to the Pakistani Gov-
 ernment.
 Pakistani Air Marshal As-
 ghar Khan says the Pakistani Air
 Force is organizing an air drop
 should it be necessary to bring
 troops into the area, which is
 relatively inaccessible by land
 routes from Pakistan.
 Afghanistan too has long
 had considerable difficulty with
 tribes on its side of the bor-
 der, especially with the Moh-
 mands,  a powerful Pushtoon tribe
 living on both sides of the bor-
 der.   Since a shooting incident
 in 1958, Kabul has increased its
 garrison in the area and pushed

 to popularize his administration
 by publicly pushing for  an
 agreement.
 Kim To-Yop,Chang's erst-
 while rival for the prime minis-
 tership and the nominal leader
 of the Democratic party's "old"
 faction, on 22 September  an-
 nounced his intention of with-
 drawing from the party and or-
 ganizing a conservative oppo-
 sition party.   Kim's effort to
 force a party split probably
 was designed to block any fur-
 ther loss of members to Chang's
 "new" faction. Chang is con-
 fident the split ultimately will
 benefit him by encouraging the
 transfer of sufficient members
 from the "old" faction to the
 prime minister's group to give
 him a majority in the National
 Assembly.
 Chang is carrying out a
 large-scale dismissal of senior
 government, provincial, and
 police officials appointed dur-
 ing the Rhee administration.
 The purge is designed to win
 popular support for the new
 government by removing unpop-
 ular local officials and al-
 legedly corrupt remnants of the
 old regime.   It also may be
 motivated in part  by a desire
 to  establish  within  the
 government an organization per-
 sonally loyal to Chang. The anti-
 corruption drive is almost cer-
 tain to demoralize government
 employees and reduce the effec-

 Inspired by the nationalistic
 sentiment which has been evident
 since  the  April  revolution,
 the press, members of the Nation-
 al Assembly, Korean employees
 of US military installations,
 and student demonstrators are
 exerting pressure on the govern-

 indicated that his government is

 progress toward this goal, and,

 require many months, as Chang's    25X1

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 29 September 1960
 Of the specific military
 issues that have vexed 'Gaullist
 France's relations with NATO,
 limited progress on integrated
 air defense was achieved on 28
 September when the North At-
 lantic Council approved crea-
 tion of an integrated air de-
 fense system that would include
 a section of France bordering
 on West Germany.   French planes
 in the area as well as in Ger-
 many will remain integrated in
 the NATO command, and the French
 radar system will be brought
 into the Allied warning net.
 While there apparently has
 been no change in De Gaulle's
 position since he removed
 France's Mediterranean fleet
 from NATO wartime control, con-
 tinuation of some practical co-
 operation is illustrated by
 French participation in cur-
 rent NATO naval exercises. At-
 tention will now focus on
 French objections to the Ameri-
 can proposal of 1 April for the
 establishment of a NATO medium-
 range ballistic missile program.
 NATO authorities hope to re-
 solve this issue by the time
 the annual ministerial meeting
 convenes in December.
 21 September.
 Spaak has found in the
 handling of the Congo crisis
 new ammunition for his continu-
 ing campaign to improve pro-
 cedures of consultation.   He
 has pointed to Belgium's fail-
 ure to seek the permanent coun-
 cil's advice in advance of the
 crisis, the failure Of NATO
 members to give Belgium their
 early advice on it, and the
 conflicting positions of NATO
 members in the UN Security
 Council debates.   One immediate
 consequence has been Brussels'
 plans to trim its NATO con-
 tribution, probably by pulling
 back its two divisions in Ger-
 many from forward positions.
 Spaak foresees similar
 difficulties arising from the
 coming    UN  General Assembly
 debates on Algeria which, he
 fears, will put France's ties
 with the alliance to a severe
 test. These are high among the   25X1
 problems dealt with in a major
 long-term study of the alliance,
 on which informal discussion began
 in the North Atlantic Council on

 late November in connection
 with the expected conclusion
 of an agreement.
 During his visit to Finland
 earlier this month, Khrushchev
 implied the USSR would not
 block Finland's association
 with EFTA provided measures were
 taken to maintain Sovd et-Fin-
 nish trade.   Once this problem
 has been resolved,  the govern-
 ment probably will propose to
 parliament that Finland associ-
 ate with EFTA--a move which
 seems certain to be approved in
 view-of the.aimost:solid,support
 from the non-Communist parties
 and most economic groups.
 FARMERS
 PARTY
 Probably the most contro-
 versial domestic issue facing
 parliament and one which is
 likely indirectly to influence
 the EFTA and government questions
 concerns proposals for new farm
 income legislation which the
 Agrarians are expected to intro-
 duce.           The Social Democrats in
 particular are determined to
 oppose vigorously any arrange-
 ment which in their view grants
 excessive benefits to farmers.
 This issue may be used by the
 opposition parties as a bargain-
 ing point by which the Agrarians
 might: ?be;_Ypressed to
 broaden the govern-
 ment.
 Another question
 which may receive
 considerable atten-
 tion is that of the
 desirability of hold-
 ing new general elec-
 tions in :view of the
 continuing impasse in
 Finnish political af-
 fairs.   Although
 elections are not
 scheduled to be held until July
 1962, pressure to hold them at
 an earlier date is likely to
 increase markedly if the
 Agrarians continue to refuse to
 broaden the government except on
 terms. unacceptable to, opposition
 parties.   In the two unsuccessful
 attempts to reorganize the gov-
 ernment last summer, the Agrarians
 proposed giving disproportionate-
 ly high representation to the
 splinter opposition Social Dem-
 ocrats while barring the regular
 Social Democrats from any
 cabinet posts.
 Despite some fears that the
 Communist-f ront Finnish Peoples
 Democratic League might further
 increase its strength as a re-
 sult of dissensidn~ within the
 Social Democratic and Agrarian
 parties,  there appears to be in-
 creased confidence among the
 democratic parties about facing
 the electorate during a period
 when the economy is booming and
 economic prospects are bright.
 An uneasy feeling persists, how-
 ever,  that even if the Commu-
 nists made only moderate gains
 in the election, President
 Kekkonen would be inclined to
 grant them representation in a
 new government

 MONGOLIA IN BLOC AND WORLD AFFAIRS
 Mongolian Communist leaders
 were forced into a difficult
 decision this summer.  After
 the Bucharest conference made it
 clear that the Soviet Union ex-
 pected satellite support in its
 feud with Peiping, the Mongolian
 central committee met and on 5
 July issued a surprisingly non-
 committal resolution.   On 14
 August, however, after Premier
 Yumzhagin Tsedenbal, who is also
 party first secretary, had ap-
 peared at the Kremlin, Unen,
 the official Mongolian newspaper
 published an article firmly de-
 claring for the USSR.   Yet,
 ~ayn Shanr
 regardless of Moscow's induce-
 ments or pressures, the fact
 that the oldest Soviet satel-
 lite had hoped to stay out of
 the polemic testifies to the
 resurgence of Chinese influence
 in Mongolia.
 Historically,  the Mongo-
 lians sought to import Russian
 influence to reduce that of the
 Chinese.   This effort, captured
 and distorted by the Bolshevik
 revolution, brought the Mongo-
 lian Communists to power in 1921
 behind an advancing Soviet Red
 Army which not only crushed
 White Russian remnants who had
 fled to Mongolia but also broke
 the centuries-old grip of Chi-
 nese suzerainty.
 Now the Chinese have reap-
 peared in the role of economic
 helpers.   Although determined
 to prevent any restoration of
 Chinese ascendancy, elements in
 the Mongolian party, restive

 USSR.

 There is no long-

 29 September 1960
 1,000 youths are sent to study
 in the USSR each year; and there
 has been some effort to replace
 classic Mongol heroes, including
 Genghis Khan, with more ortho-
 dox symbols of proletarian in-
 ternationalism like Marshal
 Choybalsan, a carbon copy of
 Stalin who died a year before
 his mentor.
 The Mongol nomads form a
 reservoir of nationalism, but
 they are politically voiceless.
 Instead, the most striking re-
 cent opposition to complete
 sovietization was spearheaded
 by a Mongolian professor, Dr.
 Rinchen, who, between 1956 and
 1959 wrote a number of books
 and poems which extolled tradi-
 tional Mongol culture and were
 unflattering to the USSR.  At-
 tacked in the Mongol press as
 "bourgeois nationalist,"
 Rinchen was eventually dismissed
 from his post at Choybalsan
 University.
 Rinchen's defense of Mon-
 gol culture--his willingness
 to snipe at "the new life of
 fraternal peoples"--appears to
 have been symptomatic of wide-
 spread dissatisfaction with the
 effort to remake Mongolia in the
 Soviet image.
 in the USSR report that their
 Mongolian acquaintances are
 contemptuous of both Chinese
 and Russians, much preferring
 Western companions to th
 from the bloc.
 Party Purge
 "Nationalism," Unen said
 in criticizing Rinchen, "cre-
 ates the soil for bourgeois in-
 trigues"--a reference to the
 factionalism which divided the
 Mongolian People's Revolution-
 ary party for five years, cul-
 minating in March 1959 with the
 purge of Dashin Damba and the
 end of "collective leadership"
 in Mongolia.
 Tsedenbal, long Choybal-
 san's heir apparent as head of
 state and party, assumed both
 jobs when the marshal died in
 1952.   Only 36 at the time,
 Tsedenbal may not
 have had a really
 firm power position
 in the politburo
 when Stalin's death
 brought on the inter-
 regnum of collective
 leadership in Moscow.
 In April 1954, Tseden-
 bal was released from
 his post as party
 first secretary, and
 into the vacancy
 stepped Dam,ba, who
 had been second sec-
 retary since 1947,
 With Damba leading
 the party and Tseden-
 bal the government,
 Mongolia embarked on
 its own collective
 leadership experiment, a step
 Unen hailed as "the most impor-
 an                                                               principle of party leader-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 29:September 1960
 Damba seemed in control of
 the 13th Mongolian party con-
 gress in March 1958.   He at-
 tacked the Choybalsan cult--and
 indirectly the marshal's pro-
 tege Tsedenbal- -charging that
 it "flagrantly violates revolu-
 tionary legality."     Even more
 significant were Damba's remarks
 about the effort to get Mongo-
 lian herdsmen to settle in co-
 operatives--a perennial objet-
 tive~of the regime.   Stressing
 that the movement to coopera-
 tives should be voluntary and
 stimulated by incentive, not
 coercion, Damba clearly implied
 that the pace of socialization
 should take Mongolia's tradi-
 tional culture patterns into
 account.
 Such concepts were not in
 harmony with general bloc ef-
 forts at the time to tighten
 socialist control over agri-
 culture, and they certainly
 were not in keeping with Tseden-
 bal's ambitions to catapult
 Mongolia immediately into the
 20th century via Communism.   By
 1958, collective leadership was
 pass& in the USSR, and Tseden-
 bal knew whom to see.
 Following Tsedenbal's No-
 vember 1958 trip to Moscow, the
 party central committee met in
 plenary session, after which
 Tsedenbal once more emerged as
 first secretary, while Damba
 reverted to second secretary
 "for better centralization of
 party leadership."   It quickly
 became apparent that social-
 ization was going to be acceler-
 ated.   By early 1959 Tsedenbal
 had consolidated his position,
 and on 31 March Damba was purged
 along with five other members
 of the politburo.
 The charges against Damba
 were vituperative, revealing
 the depth of Tsedenbal's animo s-
 ity,                  as well as indicating that
 Moscow shared this feeling.  TASS
 was prompt to report Damba's
 "lack of principle and dis-
 honesty, stupid political
 backwardness, conservatism, and
 inertia, egotism, and opportun-
 istic conciliation."  The Soviet
 journal Parf Life gave Tseden-
 bal space in which to condemn
 Damba for criticizing Choybalsan,
 now restored to his pedestal as
 "an ardent advocate of the
 friendship of peoples."   In his.
 article, Tsedenbal outlined "a
 great revolutionary measure in-
 tended to promote rapid develop-
 ment of productive forces in
 agricul hare" --essentially,
 speedy conversion of Mongolia's
 pastoral economy to one more
 closely approximating agricul-
 ture in the Soviet Union.
 In retrospect, it appears
 that Damba attempted a cautious
 de-emphasis of the Soviet pres-
 ence during his five-year con-
 trol of the party.   His willing-
 ness to oppose the recognized
 Soviet faction and his desire
 to accommodate Mongolian charac-
 teristics in socializing the
 economy point in this direction,
 giving his struggle for person-
 al power a distinctly national-
 istic tone.   It was during
 Damba's tenure that Chinese in-
 fluence experienced a renascence
 in Mongolia--a renascence Damba
 may have welcomed, but only to
 the extent that it might in some
 degree offset Soviet control.
 "Socialist Competition"
 Before the Communist vic-
 tory in China, Mao Tse-tung told
 the American writer Edgar Snow
 that "the Outer Mongolian repub-
 lic will automatically become
 a part of the Chinese federation
 when the people's revolution has
 been victorious in China."  This
 has not been repeated publicly
 since Mao took over the mainland,
 but the implications did not
 escape Moscow's notice.  When
 the Sino-Soviet treaty was signed
 in 1950, a note was appended in
 which the Chinese Communists-ac-
 knowledged Mongolia's independ-
 ence, just as Chiang Kai-shek had
 done a few years before.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 29 September 1960
 Stalin may not have trusted
 Mao completely, but he was con-
 tent to restrict, rather than
 entirely prevent, renewed Chi-
 nese activity in Mongolia.   The
 1952 joint Sino-Soviet-Mongolian
 railroad treaty kept Chinese
 construction crews from cross-
 ing Mongolia's southern boundary,
 but that same year Peiping and
 Ulan Bator agreed to "consoli-
 date cooperation" in an econom-
 ic  and cultural pact.  At the
 time it was signed, this agree-
 ment was rather vague as to
 just how far the two parties
 intended to carry their co-
 operation, but the agreement
 was used subsequently as some-
 thing of an open-end contract
 providing the justification for
 specific Chinese economic aid
 programs.
 With Stalin out of the pic-
 ture, the reins of Moscow's
 hegemony loose, and the economic
 drain of the Korean war over,
 Peiping developed a more tangi-
 ble interest in Mongolia.   By
 agreement with the Ulan Bator,
 the first of at least 10,000
 Chinese laborers began arriving
 in 1955.   These workers have
 built housing projects, bridges,
 a glass factory, food-process--
 sing plants, and a brick kiln;
 they are building or will build
 more roads, bridges, and apart-
 ment houses, plus additional
 factories for Mongolia's nas-
 cent industry; some 2,000 Chi-
 nese are swarming over the
 Harkhorin state farm construc-
 ting a sizable irrigation system.
 All this is financed by Peiping,
 whose grant and credit aid to
 Mongolia since 1956 reached a
 total of $115,000,000 with the
 extension of a new $50,000,000
 loan last May.
 Communist China's trade
 with Mongolia has multiplied
 about 50 times since 1952, a
 rise which to some extent has
 been at Soviet expense.   This
 point was formally noted in
 1957 when the 1958-60 Soviet-
 Mongolian trade agreement was
 signed.   At Ulan Bator's re-
 quest, it was agreed that Mon-
 golian exports to the USSR could
 be reduced because of the "signif-
 cant'. expansion of economic re
 lations with other countries."
 The USSR still dominates
 Mongolian trade, as it does the
 field of economic assistance.
 Moscow provides farm machinery,
 industrial equipment, and heavy
 installations such as thermal
 power plants; aid projects have
 developed mineral resources and
 transportation.
 Viewed strictly in terms
 of projects, Chinese economic
 activity in Mongolia would seem
 to complement that of the USSR.
 In balmier days of the Sino-So-
 viet alliance, Moscow may have
 found this an acceptable, if not
 wholly desirable, modus vivendi
 as long as the Chinese did not
 push for equal status in Mongo
 lia.   The Chinese, in fact, have
 been careful to stay within the
 permissive framework of "social-
 ist brotherhood," and they have
 avoided any pronouncements or
 specific actions which could be
 interpreted as interference
 either in Mongolia's :internal
 affairs or in Soviet-Mongolian
 relations.
 Peiping thus is not openly
 challenging Moscow's position
 in Mongolia, but the return of
 Chinese influence tends to
 erode that of the USSR.   Peiping
 seems to be following a policy
 of patience and of gradual en-
 croachment intended slowly to
 reorient Ulan Bator's political
 allegiance.
 There have been some indi-
 cations that Moscow is reviewing
 its position in Mongolia in the
 light of Sino-Soviet differences.
 TASS gave cursory treatment to
 Chou En-lai's visit to Ulan
 Bator last May when new assist-
 ance,      pledged to Mongolia's
 Third Five-Year Plan (1961-65),
 which suggests that the USSR
 was less than pleased.

 Moscow's 9 September loan
 to Mongolia of over $153,000,-
 000 for the new Five-Year Plan
 stipulates repayment on "easy
 terms," defers repayment of
 earlier loans, and provides for
 sending Soviet technicians and
 workers to Mongolia.   This last
 may be particularly significant
 as the USSR in recent years has
 left the labor field almost en-
 tirely to the Chinese.   The
 agreement brings total Soviet
 aid since 1956 to well over
 $275,000,000.   On 20 September,
 a further Sino-Mongolian agree-
 ment was announced providing
 Chinese labor, presumably for
 construction projects to be
 undertaken in connection with
 the Chinese loanin May.
 Diplomatic Relations
 Ulan Bator has made a
 serious effort in recent years
 to gain acceptance as a legit-
 imata.a independent state, bid-
 ding especially for contacts
 with the Afro-Asian countries.
 Burma,  India,  Indonesia, and
 Guinea now recognize Mongolia.
 As yet there are no nonbioc
 ambassadors in Ulan Bator, but
 Indonesian,  Indian, and Burmese
 ambassadors in Peiping are ac-
 credited there.   Guinea has not
 yet appointed a diplomatic rep-
 resentative,  but President Sekou
 Tour6 visited Ulan Bator on 10
 September.
 Diplomatic relations with
 Peiping and Moscow present the
 expected picture of "socialist
 unity."   Molotov served as
 Soviet ambassador in Ulan Bator
 until recently, but Mongolians
 privately expressed a dislike
 for him.   There is an interest-
 ing, although unconfirmed, re-
 port that in early 1958, the
 USSR appropriated some Mongo-
 lian territory rich in cobalt--
 an action which was said to have
 led to a stiff protest from
 Mongolian Foreign Minister
 Avarzed.   Avarzed did lose his
 job in mid-1958, and the report
 alleged this was at Molotov's
 insistence.
 Mongolia and the
 Mongolia's efforts to join

 80 percent of the free world's
 known oil reserves and account
 for almost half of the oil moving
 in international trade.   However,
 OPEC is already showing signs of
 weakness.   Iran, whose coopera-
 tion is essential, now appears
 to be having second thoughts
 about "solidarity" with the
 Arabs.
 Prelude to Baghdad Talks
 For more than two years
 Tariki and Perez have been
 working toward a world-wide
 system of prorationing oil out-
 put by agreement among the  1 1.
 world's major net oil-exporting
 countries.   They advocate an
 organization with power to set
 production levels in each
 country and determine each mem-
 ber's share of the world market,
 and thus to maintain an artifi-
 cially high price for oil.
 Tariki and Perez realized
 Iran and Iraq would have to join
 if the plan were to succeed.
 Iraq was not likely to join any
 new group in which the UAR, a
 minor producer, would have either
 membership or strong influence.
 When Tariki visited Baghdad in
 late August, he and the Iraqis
 agreed that the UAR would not
 be included and that the Arab
 League--in which the UA.R plays
 the leading role--would be given
 only observer status.   Iraq then
 warmly endorsed Tariki's plans
 for a preliminary meeting and
 insisted that it be in Baghdad.
 The task of assuring Irani-
 an attendance fell to Iraq.
 Tariki had long sought: to
 interest Iran in prorationing
 schemes.   Iran, feeling that
 Baghdad would consider a re-
 fusal to attend the meetings.an
 affront to Qasim, agreed to
 participate as an observer.
 Its decision was probably in-
 fluenced by the fact that Bah-
 rein, which Iran claims as its
 territory, was not invited.
 On 12 September representa-
 tives from Iraq, Saudi Arabia,
 Kuwait, Qatar,  Iran, and Vene-
 zuela began discussions which
 led to the formation of the new
 organization.
 Fuad Ruhani, acting man-
 aging director of the govern-
 ment-owned National Iranian
 Oil Company (NIOC), represented
 Iran in the absence of Abdullah
 Entezam, chairman of the company,
 who was on a trip to the United
 States,   Both Iranians strongly
 back most of the present pol-
 icies,. of the international oil
 industry, but Tariki proposed
 an agenda that included a number
 of proposals extremely hostile
 to the oil companies.   Such pro-
 posals would have conflicted

 warded off Tariki's proposed

 status from:observer:to dele-

 Kuwait and OPEC
 Until very recently Kuwait
 had been content to keep out of
 the controversies between the
 oil industries and the area's
 oil-producing countries.  This
 policy has helped Kuwait, which
 produced no oil before World
 War II, move to third place--
 after the United States and
 Venezuela--among  the  free
 world's oil producers.   Now,
 however, Kuwait is     showing

 signs of wanting more than
 substantial oil revenues.  Many
 influential Kuwaitis want their
 country to have a larger voice
 in the management of the Brit-
 ish- and American-owned Kuwait
 Oil Company as well as some
 control over changes in prices
 for its oil.
 It was Kuwait that asked
 Tariki to organize an emergency
 meeting of oil-producing coun-
 tries following the August cut
 in the posted prices for Middle
 East oil.  British officials
 remain convinced, nevertheless,
 that the oil policies of the
 Kuwaiti Government will continue
 to be determined by a preoccupa-
 tion with the size of the coun-
 try's oil revenues.
 from the Gulf of Aqaba to the
 Mediterranean.
 All members except Kuwait
 need funds.  Excepting Vene-
 zuela, each member has been
 urging the oil companies to
 increase production in its own
 territory at faster rates, even
 at the expense of other area
 countries.   Iran, for example,
 holds that it should :return to
 its former position as the
 Persian Gulf's leading oil pro-
 ducer, and it is concerned with
 the Arabs' rapid increases in
 output.  Saudi Arabia has told
 Aramco that its production
 should increase faster, noting
 that Kuwait, whose production
 is half again as large as Saudi
 Arabia's, has no pressing need
 for additional revenues.
 Prospects for OPEC
 The OPEC has serious
 structural and conceptual weak-
 nesses, which reduce its threat
 to the international oil in-
 dustry.   Most of the member
 governments are unstable and
 suspicious of each other.   Iran,
 for example, tends to distrust
 the Arab states and to hold
 them in contempt, recalling
 vividly the fact that the Arabs
 took advantage of the shutdown
 of Iran's oil industry follow-
 ing nationalization in 1951--52
 to achieve their present export
 position.
 The Arabs are resentful
 that Iran stepped into the
 breach during the Suez crisis
 and supplied Israel with oil
 when Moscow decided to halt
 shipments to Israel.  Most of
 Israel's petroleum needs are
 still being met by Iran, and
 it appears likely that Iranian
 shipments will increase further
 as Israel begins full-scale
 operation of its new pipeline
 International proration-
 ing of oil would be extremely
 difficult, if not impossible,
 without the cooperation of the
 oil industry and the major con-
 sumers.  For the Middle East,
 the principal consumers are
 Western European countries,
 which also take a sizable por-
 tion of Venezuelan petroleum
 exports. They are not as de-
 pendent on Middle East oil as
 the Arabs tend to believe.
 Europe is plagued with a coal
 surplus, partly because of the
 heretofore cheaper price of oil.
 Proration implies at least
 stable and possibly increased oil
 prices.   Under such conditions
 the continuing shift from coal
 to oil might be slowed down and
 possibly reversed.
 The oil fields in Algeria
 and Libya will provide Europe
 with increasing quantities of
 crude oil.  France has cut its
 imports of Middle East crude
 sharply.   Neither Libya nor
 Algeria was represented at the
 Baghdad talks, although the way

 is open for them to join.  How-
 ever, Libya is preoccupied with
 becoming a major oil-producing
 nation and would not be likely
 to agree to suggestions that
 it limit its oil exports.
 Determination of each
 country's share of the market
 would be a major, and quite
 likely insurmountable, stumbling
 block.   Saudi Arabia probably
 would press for some formula
 relating production to reserves,
 since this would give it larger
 production increases than any
 other country except Kuwait.
 Tariki has stated,  however,  that
 Kuwait is a special case, and
 a modification of any formula
 for the other members would be
 needed to halt the continued
 rapid increase in Kuwaiti out-
 put.   Venezuela is unlikely to
 agree to any export proration-
 ing based on reserves because
 of its sharp disadvantage in
 using this criterion.
 Iran, on the other hand,
 has suggested a production-to-
 population relationship, which,
 since it is the most populous
 of the several countries, would
 make it pre-eminent in pro-
 duction.   Despite these weak-
 nesses, the OPEC will likely
 make itself felt in oil councils
 in coming months, especially,
 in determining price changes.
 Tapline Problem
 The negotiations that have
 been going on for five years
 between the American-owned Trans
 Arabian Pipeline Company (Tap-
 line) and the Arab states
 through which it passes are no
 closer to solution now than a
 year ago.  The company con-
 tinues to hold that an agree-
 ment with Saudi Arabia must
 precede agreements with the
 transit countries of Jordan,
 Lebanon, and the UAR.  Cairo,
 however, has insisted that its
 demands for additional revenues
 be met and has again threatened
 to shut down the pipeline.   Tap-
 line's dispute with the UAR was
 sharpened in July when the com-
 pany halted shipments of crude
 to the HOms refinery in the
 Syrian region because of non-
 payment of bills.  The refinery
 is continuing operation with
 larger imports from the Iraqi
 Petroleum Company (IPC), but
 Syria is now paying a higher
 price for the crude oil.
 Baghdad-IPC
 Off and on since the July
 1958 revolution, Baghdad and the
 IPC have been negotiating changes
 in the company's concession a-
 greement.  Thus far, although
 the company has made a number
 of offers--including the sur-
 render of about 90,000 square
 miles, or about 52 percent of
 its total concession---no agree-
 ment has been concluded.   A new
 round of negotiations began in
 late September, but prospects
 for a settlement of outstanding
 issues continuerremote..
 The faction-ridden and di-
 vergent parties supporting the
 two-month-old Italian govern-
 ment--made up entirely of Chris
 tian Democrats--were forced in-
 to a semblance  of  unity by a
 threat to the existence of the
 democratic system in Italy;
 Nevertheless they are still
 seeking new national political
 alignments, and the outlook
 for such alignments may be
 clarified by the 6 November

 The political

 strained by the fall

 main aspirations are

 Democratic Socialists and Re-

 coalition cabinet in which the
 three divergent small center

 Christian Democrats.   Some
 Liberals and right-wing Chris-

 more directly on the monarchists

 29 September 1960
 Reluctant minority elements
 and ideological disagreements
 among the parties, however, keep
 the. fuftdamental hostilities. With-
 in and among these ';parties alive.
 The  Liberals  include a
 group'. which  nearly, blocked
 the   party's..support  of  the
 Fanfani government, on the
 grounds that acquiescence in
 the ouster of Tambroni's cabi-
 net, which had been backed by
 the neo-Fascists, immediately
 after the June-July disorders
 would be yielding to the pres-
 sure of Communist mobs.   A.1-
 though the Republican party is
 of the center-left,  the leader
 of one of its dissident factions,
 former Defense Minister Pac-
 ciardi, has been meeting with
 neo-Fascists,  former Fascist
 activists, and other extreme
 right-wing elements to discuss
 plans for forming a national
 front "in defense of the re-
 public" against a center-left
 government.
 Both left and right-wing
 Christian Democrats are repre-
 sented in the cabinet, but the
 search for party unity is
 impeded by a struggle over the
 positions which various factions
 will occupy on the election
 lists.
 The chronic problem of
 Guiseppe Saragat's Democratic
 Socialists--that of trying to
 compete with Pietro Nenni.'s
 party as representative of the
 Socialist electorate--is inten-
 sified by Nenni's announced in-
 tention to run independent elec-
 toral lists in areas where the

 majority system prevails--cities

 position vis-a-vis the Chris-

 ready trying to win back some
 Socialist support by ;pointing
 out that Nenni's 15 September
 speech showed that he intends
 to continue electoral and post-
 electoral alliances with the
 Communists in some of the
 cities with less than 10,000
 inhabitants where the majority
 electoral system still applies.
 The Christian Democrats
 have announced that they would
 make no commitments regarding
 alliances after the elections,
 and have pledged that they will
 not run linked electoral lists
 with rightist groups, although
 they are presumably leaving the
 way open for continuance of
 their alliance with the neo-
 Fascists in some of the cities--
 probably less than 1,000--now
 jointly controlled.   Nenni, for
 his part,  has indicated that he
 intends to "rescue" the Chris-
 tian Democrats from such depend-
 ance on the right and that after
 the elections his party will of-

 cities where political stalemate
 now prevents  the. mayors and
 city councils from functioning.
 The Nenni Socialists and
 monarchists are threatened by
 internal cleavages over the
 question of relations with,
 respectively,  the Communists
 and neo-Fascists--the only
 parties remaining in the

 Fanfani stated confidentially
 that the municipal governments
 of Florence, Venice, Genoa,
 Rome, Milan, and Turin  were
 in danger of falling into  the
 hands of  the Communists  and
 Socialists after the elections.
 The Communists and Social-
 ists--who together control some
 1,800 communes--took over con-
 trol of Bari and Genoa in the
 early spring, after the neo-
 Fascists withdrew support from
 the Christian Democrats in both
 cities. A Christian Democratic
 mayor was subsequently re-elect-
 ed' in Bari, but with only 24
 votes from a 60-man city coun-'
 cil.   A  government-appointed
 commissioner--al-
 ways unpopular with
 local inhabitants--
 now substitutes for a
 city council in Genoa,
 Naples, Venice, and
 Florence because of
 local political stale-
 mates.
 The new provin-
 cial election law
 passed by parliament
 in early September
 replaces the old
 majority method with
 a modified proportion-
 al system which frees
 the Nenni Socialists
 from the need to run
 joint lists with the
 Communists in order

 of the Socialist party congress
 --then the Christian Democrats
 will be tempted to adopt a
 broad policy of alliances with
 the Socialists in city and pro-
 vincial governments, several
 of which--including the cities
 of Adria and Agrigento--are al-
 ready governed by such a coali-
 tion.
 Sicily presents a partic-
 ularly thorny problem.   Even
 though elections for the
 Sicilian regional assembly are
 not being held at this time,
 the city and provincial elec-
 tions there will revive the
 quarrel over the composition of
 the regional government.   The
 Democratic Socialists question
 the propriety of the Christian
 Democrats' alliance with the
 neo-Fascists in the Sicilian
 government after disavowing that
 group's support on
 the national level.
 The Christian Demo-
 crats recently reject-
 ed' a proposal by the
 Democratic Socialists
 that a new Sicilian
 government be formed
 including both Social-
 ist parties and the
 Sicilian Christian
 Democratic dissidents
 headed by Silvio
 Milazzo.
 A Nenni Social-
 ist party congress
 will follow the local
 elections, possibly
 expect to produce electoral
 successes, to make a strong
 showing at the congress, and
 to be able to intensify pres-
 sures on the Christian Demo-
 crats to form a center-left
 government depending on Social-
 ist parliamentary support.
 New Catholic Party?
 There are indications that,
 to prevent such a rapproche-
 ment, some members of the           25X1

 are discussing formation of a
 new Catholic party.

 Outlook
 With:the calm of the
 present political truce broken
 by the local elections,  the

 reflected in the June-July
 demonstrations will again come
 into the open.   Because the

 and lack of political vitality
 and direction--will exert in-
