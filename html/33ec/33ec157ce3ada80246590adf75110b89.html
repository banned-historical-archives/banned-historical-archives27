 Briefly Noted
 Chinese Occupation and Colonization of Tibet
 Thirteen years ago on 23 May, organized Tibetan resistance to
 the Chinese Red Army ended and the Chinese Communist occupation and
 colonization of Tibet was initiated.  This anniversary has had very
 little publicity, even in the neutralist and non-aligned countries
 that take such fierce pride in their opposition to imperialism and
 colonialism, not to mention aggression and interference in the
 internal affairs of other countries.  There is no indication, for
 example, that these nations are making any plans to get the Tibetan
 issue on the Fall 1963 agenda of the UN General Assembly.   It is an
 ironic fact that Red China's rape of Tibet is being allowed to fade
 from the world's memory largely because the Chinese Communists'
 wanton attack on India is more recent and thus more "newsworthy."
 Immediately after the forced signing of the Chinese-Tibetan
 agreement in 1951, the Chinese Communists began violating the agree-
 ments and undertook the communization of Tibet.  The Tibetan people
 resisted the attempts to impose upon them a way of life that was
 alien to their history and incompatible with their religion.  The
 disaffection of the Tibetan people for their Red Chinese occupiers
 culminated in the March 1959 revolt of the Dalai Lama which was
 mercilessly crushed.  There is ample evidence of the genocide that
 has since been inflicted upon the Tibetan people and this must
 remain on the conscience of all men who respect the rights of
 pence-loving nations and who value their own freedom.  Tibet's only
 desire toward her neighbors was to live in peace with them and
 because of this desire, Tibet no longer exists as a free and
 independent nation.
 The neutralist and non-aligned nations, particularly India and
 others in southeast Asia who are Red China's neighbors, should under-
 stand that their willingness to forget Tibet will only encourage
 Peking to carry out the same pattern somewhere else.   India parti-
 cularly should take the initiative in reviving publicity about Tibet:
 not only has she recently acquired additional experience regarding
 Red China's aggressiveness, but one important reason the Chinese
 Communists absorbed Tibet was to use it as a base to penetrate the
 Tibetan-Indian border areas which ultimately became part of the
 pretext for unprovoked attacks against India itself.
 On December 20, 1961, the United Nations approved -- by a vote
 of 56 to 11, with 29 abstentions -- a resolution calling on the
 Chinese Communists to free the Tibetan people and grant them their
 fundamental human rights and freedoms, including the right to self-
 determination.  The appeals set forth in that resolution have
 universal validity and deserve the constant and continuing support
 of all men who oppose international aggression regardless of whether
 that aggression happens to be the news of the day.  This resolution
 should be recalled to the delegations attending the UN 18th General
 Assembly which opens in September.

 Cuba's Communism No Longer "Sugar-Coated"
 Cuba's average sugar crop from 1957 through 1961 was 6,303,060
 tons despite artificial restrictions.  The 1962 crop -- Cuba's
 first year of declared Communism -- fell to 4, 803, 00,E tons which
 was 60,000 tons short of Cuba's commitments to the Communist Bloc.
 The prospects for 1963 -- Cuba's "Year of Organization" -- suggest
 a total of, at the most, 3.5 to 4 million tons and many estimates
 are lower.
 Failure to meet production goals belies the propaganda about
 "glorious" Communist "achievements" and underscores Cuba's economic
 plight.  Cuba promised to sell the Communist Bloc 4,360,000 tons of
 sugar a year through 1965 in return for equipment and other barter
 ite Ds.  Obviously, it will not be able to fulfill its promise and
 even heavier outlays from the Communist Bloc will be required to
 maintain Cuba.   Sugar sold on the open market is reaping premium
 prices, but Cuba's small production leaves it no surplus to tale
 advantage of this development.  Reports persist that Soviet Russia
 is re-selling Cuba's sugar for a profit.
 Many of the reasons for Cuba's dwindling sugar production were
 cited in a previous Propaganda Guidance -- Item 621 WH, b .   "Cuba's
 Sugar Crop Exposes Basic Communist Failings" (see also Item 615 W}a,
 "1963:   Cuba's 'Year of Organization'").  They include bureaucratic
 inefficiency, failing equipment,  lack of manpower, absence of
 shillec1 technicians and managers, shortage of cane, fertilizer and
 irrigation limitations, shortages of transportation, equipment,
 sugar bags, etc.  Reduced wages, military conscription, Militia
 .mobilization, parades and other trappings of a Communist State have
 taken their toll.  Exhortations for greater effort and the promise
 of machines to do the work have failed to alleviate the situation.
 The outlook for next year is not much better.
 We cite Cuba's sugar record as an example of "fulfillment" of
 Communist promises and one of the underlying reasons for Castrc's
 prolonged trip to Moscow.

 OMMUNIST DISSENSIONS
 14-27 May 1963
 Commentary
 Principal Developments:
 1.  After months of approaches, proposals and counter-proposals,
 the Soviet and Chinese Parties are finally agreed to a meeting of
 high-level delegations in Moscow July 5 to discuss their differ-
 ences on ideological and tactical matters.  Both delegations will
 include top ideological specialists, at a level just below "the
 sup g sit . ?
 25X1C10b
 2.  However, both sides continue to press their political-ideolog-
 ical warfare with unabated vigor, in a series of political actions,
 official statements, speeches and published articles.
 3.  Both sides seem to have made some progress in their efforts to
 line up support for their respective positions, -- with Peking
 apparently having more to show in the way of results.  The Chinese
 succeeded in getting a joint statement in tune with their line
 si;nod with the unaligned North Vietnamese Ho Chi Minh and another
 by the already aligned New Zealand CP boss, and saw the chief of
 the important Soviet-wooed and formerly unaligned Indonesian Party
 come out with a speech which seemed to put the PKI openly on Pe insg~as
 side.  They also followed up on their success at the Djakarta Afro-
 Asian Journalists Conference last month by their ostentatious
 reception and fetin?  of delegates of seven A-A countries from the
 conference.  Moscow's month-long red-carpet pampering of Castro
 seems to have atoned to some degree for the damage to the Soviet
 image resulting from last fall's "capitulationisn," producing a
 joint statement on their side, -- and Tito and his cohorts spoke
 out in defense of the Soviet line.
 4.  Moscow observers agree that Khrushchev seems to have bounced
 back from any threat to his leadership, demonstrating new vigor
 and confidence in his authority.  Topping in the New York Times
 (May 25) reports that diplomatic representatives cite two principal
 factors in Khrushchev's rebound:  Kozlov's illness, renewing the
 Party's difficulties in agreeing on a possible successor, and the
 Castro visit.  Khrushchev has seemed to draw strength from his
 association with Castro, it is said, and Castro's written alignment
 with the CPSU is a considerable tangible achievement.
 Significance:  Although it is practically impossible to predict the
 course it ter ll take and the immediately visible results, the forth-
 coming Moscow bilateral meeting may be one of the most momentous
 events in the history of world Communise.  Both protagonists have
 been acting more like enemies preparing their positions for combat
 than fraternal members of the sane club trying to reach agreement
 by Pive-and-take.   The consensus of Western analysts is that the
 factors favoring conflict between the two are indeed of such
 magn~i

 :-arty-state rivalry and hostility.    However, in its-struggle for
 support by the rest of the world Communist movement, each party is
 under heavy pressure to make a maximum apparent effort to restore
 unity.  This compulsion is probably the only factor which brought
 the apparently reluctant soviets to agree to this meeting and it
 will be a strong force acting to prevent any open rupture of
 relations and even tending to produce so-no sort of "papering-over"
 agreement  which both could accept.   In any case, the basic causes
 of conflict will in all likelihood be little affected by any
 "agreements" which may be announced, and the exposure of them by    25X1 C1 Ob
 all means pcssiblo will continue to be a top-priority task for us.

 May 7 and 12 - The Albanians continued their attacks on Khrushchev
 and     o w  h articles in their cultural weekly Drita on the 7th
 and Zeri i Popullit on  the 12th.
 mraw 1-4 - The CPSU announced that the plenum scheduled for 28 May
 would be postponed to 13 June.  The announcement stated that the
 decision was made on 3 May, -- as though to link it with Kozlov's
 illness which was announced on 4 May.  On the same day, Peking
 announced its acceptance of a new  PSU proposal that the bilateral
 talks in Moscow begin on 5 July.
 May 15 - The CPSU announced the names of a top-level delegation,
 hea ecl by Suslov, for talks with the Chinese beginning 5 July.
 The announcement recounted that the C?SU had originally proposed
 15 May for the talks, that the CCP hnd proposed postponing until
 mid-June and that the CPSU had countered with the 5 July date
 "because June is filled with previously planned events, including
 some that are international in nature."   (There has been subsequent
 speculation that the really important "international" event in June
 might be Khrushchev's visit to Yugoslavia:   such a visit has been
 referred to as forthcoming in a 16 May article by Unita's Moscow
 correspondent Boffa and in a 20 May Radio Moscow brow ca ast to Serbo-
 Croatian to Yugoslavia.)  And on the same date, Pravda L,d a   teea
 by French CP chief Torez to an FCP plenum denounctngg  he "left-wind,
 deviation" of the Chicoms as the main danger to international
 communism.
 May 15-10 - Chinese chairman Liu Shao-chi climaxed his week-long
 visit t? North Vietnam by delivering a sharp polemical speech to
 the Marxist Institute in Hanoi on the 15th and winning Ho Chi Minh's
 signature to a joint statement on the 16th which gave an iiapression
 of Vietnamese support for Chinese views.  The Vietnamese avoided
 any clear-cut commitment to the Chinese side and did not really
 move from their previous "non-alignment": 'owever, the statement
 conveyed the appearance of support by emphasizing a number of
 common ideological positions in conflict with the Soviet line and
 including Ho's tribute to China's "socialist construction" while
 omitting mention of other questions on which Ho's views are closer
 to the Soviets.  At the Party school, Liu stated that the interna-
 tional Coimaunist movement is now "in a crucial period of utmost
 importance" because of an "acute struggle between the Marxist-
 Leninists and the modern revisionists" centered around whether the
 people of the world "should carry out revolutions or not, and
 whether the proletarian parties should lead the world's people in
 revolutions or not."  It is the task of all Marxist-Leninists, he
 said, "not to evade the challenge of modern revisionists but to
 unite to smash its attack completely," and he urged all Communists
 to study the works of Stalin -- as well as Marx, Engels and Lenin.
 The joint statement puts both parties on record as emphasizing unity
 on the basis of the 1957 and 1960 Moscow resolutions, which means
 that "in the present circumstances, revisionism, in other words,
 right opportunism, is the main danger in the international
 Communist movement....   It seeks persistently to...deny the histori-

 social3sr,  and  ommun    .... ugos avia is the cork trated expression
 'of modern revisionist 'theories.'  ... Further exposure of the Yugo
 Slav revisionist clique remains an essential task of the Marxist-
 Leninist parties of all countries."  Both parties also "reaffirm
 the necessity of calling a meeting of representatives of the Communist
 and workers parties of the whole world in order to eliminate the
 differences and strengthen unity," for which "it is necessary to
 make adequate preparations," including bilateral talks such as those
 scheduled between the CPSU and CCP, which are greeted with satis-
 faction.   "Ho Chi Minh pays warm tribute to the great successes
 achieved by the Chinese people in socialist construction under the
 leadership of the CCP and Chairman Mao Tse-tung and guided by the
 three red banners -- the general line for socialist construction,
 the great leap forward, and the people's communes."
 May 1S - Delivering a major policy speech to a CC plenum of the
 Yugoslav Party, Tito voiced his gratitude to Khrushchev and his
 associates for making possible improved relations with the CPSU
 (tharouh the decisions of the 20th and 22nd Party Congresses) and
 then launched into a hard-hitting attack on the Chinese, who "are
 persisting in their dogmatic positions on relations within ... the
 Coxmryaunist movement."  Noting that "we have been accused of revision-
 ism" by the Chinese leaders, Tito acknowledged that "we do not
 consider ourselves infallible, just as we do not consider a Commu-
 nist Party or movement infallible, and least of all the CCP leader-
 ship.11  However, "practice and results are the best gauges of the
 correct application of the theories of Marx, Engels and Lenin," and
 "if we regard the practice and the results achieved by the Chinese
 Corrtaunists in their internal development, then their errors have
 been of Himalayan proportion in comparison with ours."  Noting the
 Chinese claim that the Yugoslav economy is in a continual and
 profound crisis provoked by a return to capitalism, Tito said "I
 am sure that they would be extremely happy to find themselves in
 such a crisis."  He states his opinion that the Chinese charge of
 Yuoslav return to capitalism is made solely to undercut "the great
 prestige Yugoslavia enjoys in the Asian and African countries," and
 goes on to accuse the Chinese of developing "nationalism of the
 worst possible kind" which is reflected "in the policy of pitting
 the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America against the peoples
 of Europe and the developed countries."   He also points an accusing
 finger at the Chinese for inducing factional strife and interference
 in the internal affairs of other parties and countries by disseminat-
 ing in other countries "various kinds of pamphlets with a dogmatic
 content, materials containing slanders and distortions of the truth,"
 against other parties and their leaders.  Finally, in foreign policy,

 promiso claro hacia el lado chino y realmente no cambiaron de su anterior "no ali-

 $aludo de Ho Para la "construcci6n socialists" china mientras que omitfa mencionar
 otras cuestiones en las cuales las opinions de Ho estdn mds de acuerdo con las so-

 una "aguda lucha entre los marxistas-leninistas y los revisionistas moderns" acerca
 de si los pueblos del mundo "deberdn o no lievar a cabo revoluciones y si los par-

 posibles mejores relaciones con el PCUS (a travels de las resolutions del XX y el
 XXII Congreso del Partido) y luego lanz6 un violento ataque contra los chinos, que
 "persisten en sus posiciones dogmdticas en cuanto a las relaciones internas y el
 ulterior desarrollo del movimiento comunista."  Tomando nota de que "hemos sido acu-
 sados de revisionismo" por los lideres chinos, Tito reconoci6 que "no nos creemos
 infalibles, los mismo que no consideramos infalible, a un movimiento o Partido comu-
 nista, y mucho menos al liderato del PC chino."  Sin embargo, "la prdctica y los re-
 sultados son los mejores medidores de la correcta aplicaci6n de las teorfas de Marx,
 2ngels y Lenin," y "si consideramos la prdctica y'los resultados conseguidos por los
 chinos comunistas en su desarrollo interno, entonces sus errores han sido tan grander
 como las Himalayas en comparaci6n a los nuestros."  Tomando nota del argumento
 chino de que la economla yugoslava estd en continua y profunda crisis a causa de un
 regreso al capitalismo, Tito declar6 que "estoy seguro que a ellos les complaceria
 sobremanera estar en una crisis semejante."  Expres6 su opinion de que la acusaci6n
 china de regreso al capitalismo por parte de los yugoslavos la hacen solo para so-
 cavar "el gran presitigio de que goza Yugoslavia en los passes de Asia y Africa,
 acusando luego a los chinos de desarroilar un "nacionalismo de la peor clase" que se
 refleja "en la polltica de poner a los pueblos de Asia, Africa y Ammrica Latina
 contra los pueblos de Europa y los palses desarrollados."  Tambidn apunta un lndice
 acusador hacia los chinos por inducir la lucha faccionaria y la intromisi6n en los
 asuntos internos de otros partidos y palses difundiendo en otros palses "diversas
 clases de folletos de contenido dogmdtico, materiales que contienen calumnias y de-
 formaciones de la verdad" contra otros partidos y sus lfderes.  Finalmente, en
 quanto a politica exterior, acusa a los chinos de trotskismo abierto por su consign
 de "una ofensiva permanente."  Otros que tomaron parte en el pleno atacaron tambidn
 a los chinos, entre ellos Dobrivoje Vidic, quien declar6 que "unos 400 articulos
 contra Yugoslavia han aparecido en la prensa china en los oltimos cinco meses."

 bb4. The American Struggle for Negro Equality
 1.  The US Government is committed to equal rights for all
 citizens.  The major judicial stop toward overcoming segrega  on of
 the races in the US was the Supreme Court decision of 1954 that
 "separate but equal" school facilities were "inherently unequal."
 and therefore unlawful under the constitution.  The following year
 the Court ruled "federal, state or local laws... requiring or per-
 mi ttin g such discrimination must give way" and that the states must
 begin    "prompt and reasonable start toward full compliance" with
 the 1954 ruling.   In a precedent-setting decision on discriminatory
 practice by private establishments, the Supreme Court ruled on
 May 21, 1963, that the Negro's effort to obtain equal service at
 stores, restaurants, and theatres could not be prevented by uncon-
 stitutional segregation laws.
 Complementing ,judicial rulings on the constitutional questions,
 the Executive Branch of the government under the President has out-
 lawed discrimination in fields within its jurisdiction by promulgat-
 ing the Fair Employment Practices Act, Fair Education Practices Act,
 Fair Housing Law and by abolishing segregation in the Armed Forces.
 The US Government moved troops into Oxford, Mississippi, in
 October 1962 to assist a Negro student's court-ordered entry into
 the University in the face of threatened violence.  President Keita
 of Mali recognized the import of the US Government's determination
 to protect the right of one of its Negro citizens when he tele-
 graphed congratulations to President Kennedy for his decisive action.
 The Justice Department is making increasing use of lawsuits on
 behalf of persons denied voting registration or entry to desegre-
 gatecd school facilities.  An aggressive Presidential Committee on
 Equal Opportunity is pressing government contractors to hire
 Negroes; government representatives are acting as mediators at the
 scene of racial differences, persuading fair minded citizens to
 ta: co the lead in settling their differences, pressuring segregation-
 ist officials to uphold the laws of the land.
 In addition to the exercise of official powers, the President
 and other government officials are using the prestige of their high
 offices to give strong personal leadership to individuals, groups
 and civic leaders in the drive to establish equal opportunity in
 all areas of civil life, e.g. education, employment, voting.
 The African Foreign Ministers Conference meeting in Addis
 Ababa recognized the US Government's determination to protect the

 rights of its minority citizens.  On May 21st they agreed to
 recommend to the Heads of State that the Conference ... "expresses
 its satisfaction with the attempt of the Federal Government of the
 US to end these intolerable practices which might harm the relations
 of the Governments and peoples of Africa and the Government and
 people of the US of America."
 2.   Increasing Progress is being made toward civil rights.
 Dramatic gains have  eon made in the key fields in the pas   wenaty
 years.  Voting.  Negroes in all Southern states have been register-
 ing faster               an whites where, one generation ago, virtually no
 Negroes voted.    The growing Negro vote will help defeat the
 segregationist whose traditional resistance to change must be over-
 came.  Median income of the Negro has increased sixfold in the past
 twenty years as contrasted with a fourfold increase for whites.
 Between 1959 and 1963 the Census Bureau shows a rise in Negro
 income of 13 per cent and white of 3 per cent.  The rate of unemploy-
 ment among Negroes, however, is 8.7 per cent of the Negro work force
 as against 4.7 of the white.  Transportation segregation has
 virtually disappeared in all  ut a very few southern towns.  Public
 accommodations in urban areas are increasingly desegregated. Statutes specifically forbidding discrimination now exist in 28
 states and the District of Co'.u-mbia.  Discrimination in housing has
 shown little improvement and is usually due to economic rather than
 either legal or social factors.   Lynching, often used abroad to
 present a distorted picture of the Negro in America, has virtually
 cdisappeared.  Statistics show seven lynchings in the past ten years
 as against 105 in 1901 or 161 in 1692.
 Gunnar Myrdal, Swedish economist, reform leader and Senator,
 told a commencement class at the predominantly Negro Howard Univer-
 sity, in Washington D.C., June 1962:   "...in historical perspective
 the rapidity of progress is astonishing.  Let us remember that
 practically all of this progress has taken place in the short period
 of the last twenty years."  Citing the growing affluence of society
 and the reality of American constitutional ideals as factors in his
 a?Traisal he said "...the trend moves steeply upward.   In this new
 epoch, the Negro cause is a winning one." Myrdal's 1942 book
 An American Dilemma, the Negro problem and Modern Democracy (Myrdal,
 Sterner and Rose. 20th anniversary Edition              Harper and
 Row; $16.50) foresaw., big changes in the status of the Negro.        25X1C10b

 and  oscow                                                      -     ?---
 BACKGROUND :
 Relations with China.  Because of geographic position and
 historic precedent,    a   etnamese have always been keenly aware
 of the threat from their powerful and demanding Chinese neighbor,
 and having successfully maintained their own national identity
 during a thousand years of Chinese occupation and domination, the
 Vietnamese have had a wealth of experience in resisting Chi:neso
 incursions.  Traditionally, Vietnamese policy has been to pay
 public obeisance to Chinese suzerainty (token tribute:   allowing
 the Chinese to invest Vietnamese emperors with office when they
 succeeded to the throne, etc.)  while zealously protecting their
 right to govern themselves.  Thus, historically, there is a pattern
 of formal acceptance of Chinese interest in Vietnam affairs and
 at the same time of resistance to attempts by the Chinese to inter-
 fere in the actual governing of the country.  Generally speaking,
 the attitude of most Vietnamese toward China, engendered by this
 perennial relationship of a weaker to a stronger power,  is one of
 latent fear and active dislike.  Vietnamese children have been
 raised on stories of Chinese rapaciousness and cruelty, and the
 occupation of North Vietnam by Chinese national forces in 1945 and
 1946, which looted and raped and plundered, only served to confirm
 the age-old hatred and apprehension.   It is unlikely that allegiance
 to a common Marxist doctrine could modify in a few years an attitude
 that is the product of centuries.
 There is no denying, however,the importance to the North Viet-
 namese Communist leaders -- particularly in their war with the
 French -- of the Communist takeover in China.   From 1949 to the
 end of the war with the French, Ho Chi Minh was the recipient of
 extensive Chinese military, economic and technical aid which was
 an important contribution to Ho's ultimate victory at Dien Bien
 Phu.  More important even,  in the long run, than the concrete mili-
 tary and economic aid from Mao, was the fact that the revolution-
 ary situation in which Ho Chi Minh and his men had to operate had
 basic similarities with that of China; therefore, the North Viet-
 namese Communists were in a position to profit, in their own mic-
 rocosm, from the vastness and variety of Chinese Communist exper-
 ience.  Obviously, the theory of a peasant revolution operating
 from rural bases and using the tactics of a broad united front
 against a better equipped and numerically superior enemy is an
 application of Marxism-Leninism which bears much more directly on
 the situation in Vietnam than that of the classic three-stage pro-
 letarian-based revolution.  Moreover, despite the tactical zigs
 and zags, the over-all strategy of the Chinese Communists, with
 its emphasis on militancy and aggressive action, fitted in much

 better with Vietnamese recent experience with the French and with
 their aspirations for taking over South Vietnam than the gradualism
 being advocated by the USSR.
 While the establishment of a Soviet Embassy in Hanoi in Novem-
 ber 1954 provided the North Vietnamese leaders with an opportunity
 to counterbalance Chinese influence, not only their interpretation
 of Marxist-Leninist theory and its specific application, but the
 very organization of the Vietnamese party itself and its military
 and mass organs all bear a basic resemblance to their Chinese
 counterparts.
 Relations with the Soviet Union.   Throughout the war of
 liberation from French rule, the  ewers of the Viet Minh had
 pledged themselves to fight until all of Vietnam were liberated
 and united.  Russian pressure obliged the Vietnamese Communists
 to sign the Geneva Agreements of 1954.  This act, because it pa-
 tently consented to the division of the country and stopped short
 of their promises of continuing the struggle until the entire
 country was reunited, placed the DRV leaders in an embarrassing
 position.  Their loss of face was intensified when they failed to
 persuade the Diem government to hold national elections as speci-
 fied in the Geneva Agreements.  Thus, Khrushchev's strategy of
 "peaceful co-existence" -- with its corollary  of  a temporary
 status quo in Southeast Asia -- which corresponded to Soviet
 strategical needs in 1954, was clearly a liability to North Viet-
 nam.  Pressure from the Soviets to follow a soft tactical line
 with continued emphasis on united front tactics was also a handi-
 cap to the party domestically in applying stringent Communist
 measures to rebuild the economy.
 When, more than a year after the Geneva Conference, it became
 apparent that the new Diem government would not agree to the hold-
 ing of nation-wide elections, the Party decided to press forward
 on the domestic front with a program of vigorous socialization.
 Seeking aid at this time for reconstruction of the North Vietnamese
 economy, Ho received three times more from Peking than from Moscow.
 The ruthless agrarian reform policy which Hanoi adopted in 1956
 was clearly modelled on the Chinese pattern.
 Much of Khrushchev's new program as enunciated at the 20th
 CPSU Congress was anathema to Ho and the Vietnamese leadership
 since it was patently unsuited to the situation the Vietnamese
 Communists faced.   For example, the Lao Dong Party resolution,
 commenting with evident distaste on Khrushchev's theory of the
 non-inevitability of war, stressed instead the need for "strug,gle"
 and "vigilance."   lnd, at various times, Soviet de-Stalinization
 was publicly blamed for the pessimism and skepticism which had
 infected the Party.   In January 1957, the Soviets actually proposed
 that both North and South Vietnam be admitted to the United Nations
 as separate states, thus placing the stamp of approval on the ter-
 ritorial division.  Following the failure (from Ho's point of view)

 of the Geneva Agreement, the unpalatable course which Khrushchev
 set at the 20th CPSU Congress, and the disastrous consequences of
 the forced Chicom-style collectivization program, the North Viet-
 namese Communists began to emphasize the importance to the Vietnam-
 ese people of finding their own path:                   "our party has already
 achieved considerable results in the way of creative application
 of Marxism-Leninism to conditions in Vietnam."  By late 1959,  in
 place of the previous praises for the Chinese model and "ideology
 of Mao Tse-tung," Hanoi began ascribing all its revolutionary
 victories to Lenin and Ho Chi Minh, Lenin's " ost outstanding
 disciple" who had "creatively applied Marxism-Leninism to the
 concrete c=onditions of Vietnam." By 1960 there were indications
 that the North Vietnamese leaders were beginning to look to the
 Soviet Union for guidance in economic development programs.  The
 extension of sizeable economic credits by both Moscow and Peking
 in the winter of 1960-1961 testified to the effectiveness of North
 Vietnam's effort to steer a middle course in domestic policy through
 the crisis in Sino-Soviet relations.  Ho Chi Minh has made several
 efforts to act as mediator in the Sino-Soviet dispute and to effect
 a reconciliation between Moscow and Peking.
 Ho Chi Minh.  The ability of North Vietnam to play off one of
 its powerful `benefactors against the other and to develop its own
 indigenous forms -)f Marxism-Leninism depends by and large on the
 ability of an ascetic but benevolent looking heptagenarian who for
 many years has been the dominant Communist personality not only in
 Vietnam but in Laos, Cambodia and -- at one time -- in all South-
 east Asia.   If indeed a way exists to maintain such a balance, Lo
 Chi Minh will probably find it.
 Since 1911 when he left Indochina as a cabin boy on a French
 tramp steamer, Ho has struggled with singleminded ruthlessness and
 with considerable ability for the "liberation" of Southeast Asia
 and for the establishment of "socialism."  Between 1911 and 1925,
 Ho travelled in Europe and Russia, was a founding member of the
 French Communist Party (1920), and became the leading Communist
 expert in Southeast Asia.  From Paris and Moscow he organized,
 trained and directed his compatriots in the art of resistance.
 In 1925, he returned to his homeland as Comintern representative
 for Southeast 4sia and during the next 10 years helped to found
 the majority of Communist parties in that part of the world.   In
 1940. he emerged as the unchallenged leader of Vietnamese communism
 and subsequently of the resistance against the Japanese occupation.
 During this period, Ho's unrivalled ability for political intrigue
 enabled him again and again to out-maneuver his opponents.  Thus,
 in 1945, when the French were seeking to re-impose control over
 their former colonial appendage, they found themselves facing the
 most sophisticated, experienced and able Communist in Southeast
 Asia, who, paradoxically, enjoyed both the reputation of a leader
 of high standing in, international communism and, at home, the
 popularity and esteem of a great patriot.  Today, after almost

 10 years of Communist government in North Vietnam and despite the
 failure of many of his programs, Ho remains the best known and most
 popular leader in Vietnam, the final proof of his political acumen.
 Summary.  While the Sino-Soviet dispute and competition for
 Vietnamese allegiance is certainly a challenge even to Hots skill
 at manipulation, it has had important advantages for the Viet-
 namese Communists in that (a) it has permited Ho to exact aid on
 a larger scale than would have been possible otherwise (as of mid
 1962 the USSR had extended 365 million dollars worth and China
 477 million) and (b) most important,  it has allowed North Vietnam
 to use Russia as a counterweight to Chinese domination and to
 avoid loss of national independence.
 While its relations with China and the USSR have had many
 vicissitudes, North Vietnari has managed to avoid becoming the
 satellite of either and is currently using the Sino-Soviet dispute
 to maintain its independence from both and to further assert its
 25X1C1Ob own brand of communism.

 BACKGROUND:  British Guiana, a small country of some 80,000
 square miles    th a population of around 600,030 situated on the
 northeast coast of South America, is in a desperately chaotic con-
 dition after close to two years of domestic control by Premier
 Cheddi Jagan's government.  The immediate crisis has been a serious
 food shortage and Jagan's use of strike breakers to end a month old
 strike.  The strike was the Trade Union Council's (TUC) answer  to
 Jagan's attempt to gain control of the labor movement through April
 legislative proposals giving the government the right to deterraine
 which unions should be recognized by employers for collective bar-
 gaining.                   The widespread strike, supported by unions all over the
 world through blacklisting ships bound for British Guiana, has been
 carried out without serious violence and with maintenance of essen-
 tial public utilities.
 This strike came on the heels of other demonstrations led by
 opposition parties against the governnent's economic maladministra-
 tion, reflected, for example, in:   increasing unemployment which
 is now about 20 percent; decreasing tax revenues; decreasing busi-
 ness activity (merchants are loath to re-establish business disruptad
 a year ago in Georgetown or to establish new ones in cities subject
 to civil disturbances -- chambers of commerce in several cities are
 backing the strike against the government) ; and foreign investment
 has come almost to a halt as a result of the unstable political
 situation.
 The strike was the second time that Jagan has aroused the
 people to strong open resistance.   In February 1962 his budget pro-
 posals, including forced savings (a Communist practice), were met
 with riots in Georgetown from which the capital has not recovered
 and which reverberated through the economic life of the country.
 Political Parties.  Jagan's Communist-dominated People's
 Progressive Party      ), supported mainly by the East Indian rural
 population (rice farmers and sugar workers form the backbone), Egon
 20 seats (with approximately 42% of the popular vote) in the February
 1962 elections to form the government with which the British were
 expected to negotiate full independence by 1963.  The People's
 National Congress (PNC), led by L. Forbes Burnham and drawing its
 support almost wholly from the ur!jan Negro community (slightly
 smaller than the East Indian which accounts for almost half of the
 population) won eleven seats with approximately 41% of the popular
 vote.  While less radical and pro-Bloc than the PPP, it favors a
 leftist policy and nonalignment in foreign affairs.  Four seats
 were won by the multi-racial United Force Party (UF) with 16% of
 the popular vote, based on the small commercial class including the
 t ion.

 a anA inept adminis   t io a and increas-
 ing Communist  om na ion are causing discontent within the PPP and
 among its East Indian supporters.  Opposition exists but is badly
 disorganized and weak against the well controlled party machine.
 Speaker of the legislative assembly Ral,ma.n Gajraj, elected by the
 PPP apparently because he could influence the Muslim vote, now
 says that Islam and communism are incompatible.  A visit to Berlin
 and the Wall is reported to be the reason for his change of mind
 about the PPP leadership.  He has spoken out against the adminis-
 tration's labor bill, for which The Mirror took him to task.
 Attorney-General Ramsahoye, while 3iscontented, was reported late
 last year to be re uc an  to resign this post and his legislative
 seat lest this action bring down the government.
 The PPP and PNC have been unwilling to compromise the differ-
 ences which resulted. in the failure of the London conference on
 independence in October-November 1962 (which should have provided
 for the transfer of British control over external affairs and
 defense with the drafting of a new constitution and the setting of
 a date for full independence).  The PNC wants elections to be held
 before independence on the basis of the proportional representation,
 giving it an opportunity to gain a majority in the Congress.   (The
 PPP won 20 seats against the PNC's 11 by gaining a mere 1.7% margin
 of the popular vote.  The PPP now has only 18 seats since Balram
 Singh Rai was expelled from the party and the election of one
 other delegate was invalidated.  The opposition now controls 16
 seats, the original 11 PNC and 4 UF with Rai now voting against the
 PPP.)   Jagan refuses to consider either proposal, demanding instead
 that the British grant immediate independence to his government.
 ',3NC leader Forbes Burnham has turned down a recent Jagan proposal
 for a coalition government with the PPP.
 Jagan's inefficiency and inability to run the government, and
 his willingness to sacrifice good labor practice for the sake of
 dictatorial control, have led to some doubts among his East Indian
 supporters.  But they have no alternative East Indian leader, and
 they will not vote for the PNC, that is, for a Negro.
 The multi-racial OF is in a difficult position with the uncer-
 tainty of racial tensions.   It supports the TUC demands and could
 conceivably wield the balance in future Assembly voting.
 Jagan's Machine.  Although Jagan's Communist orientation was
 early recognize, t e chairman of the British committee in London,
 investigating the Georgetown riots of February, was probably among
 the first to make a decisive statement when he said that Jagan's
 testimony established him as a Communist "beyond peradventure"
 (i.e. doubt), Jagan's own statements have clarified his political
 position.  For example, on April 26th of this year,  in a speech
 delivered for him by his wife to the Winnipeg Press Club, he said:
 "Will socialists like me be allowed to bring about
 the millennium by peaceful means?  Or is Fidel
 Castro's way of armed struggle the only way out?"

 His radical, dictatorial position was further established when,
 according to an official TUC release on May 20th he is reported
 to have said to union delegates, at a meeting which he requested:
 "Gentlemen, I can assure you that if this government
 is overthrown the supporters of the government will
 not take it sitting down.  There will be a war and a
 blood bath.  There will be a second Congo here."
 Jagan has increasingly staffed his party and government with
 Communists, concomitantly developing other Communist ties and
 policies.   It is believed that his wife, radical, longtime Commu-
 nist activist Janet Jagan, has been the strong element in
 bungling, inept Cheddi's move into Communist ranks.  Among the
 increasingly obvious Communist steps taken by Jagan and his PPP
 party machine are the following:
 1)  PPP's official political paper Thunder follows
 the Communist line.  The Mirror, co=ercial counterpart
 to Thunder, is controlled through the New Guiana Com-
 pany,  Ltd. by Minister of Finance Charles Jacob, Jr.
 with several deputy directors who are active cr office
 holding PPP members. One recent article, illustrative
 of the "socialist" line of the paper, was "I Can Be a
 Christian and a Communist at the Same Time."
 2)  Janet Jagaa, editor of Thunder, is a recognized
 government spokesman and considered to be the party's
 main tactician.  She has made goodwill trips to Communist
 countries, e.g. East Germany and most recently the China
 Mainland where she was greated by Mao, as well as to the
 USSR.   It is believed that British Guiana would recognize
 the CPR if Jagan should control a fully independent gov-
 ernment.
 3)   Jagan openly rigged the April 1962 PPP congress
 which ousted the only anti-Corununist member of the
 Executive Council, Balram Singh Rai (which shook the
 faith of some East Indian peasants).   In June 1962 Rai
 was also removed as Minister for Home Affairs and
 expelled from the PPP.   In his place Claude Christian
 was appointed.  As a youth leader Christian, identified
 as at least a Coi:miunist sympathizer, was active in
 sending students to Cuba and the Soviet 3loc.  His new
 Position gives him control, among other things, over
 the police.
 4)  Although Jagan's government is seeking trade
 and aid wherever it can be found, it is probably of
 significance that:   capital equipment has been obtained
 from East Berlin -- Minister for Commerce and Trade
 Hubbard made a trip to East Germany; the Minister of
 Agriculture, I3rindley Bonn, is increasingly attacking
 the UK and the US; trade ties and other contacts with
 Cuba and Soviet Bloc countries are increasing; requests

 specified that they be from Communist Bloc coun-
 tries or from countries whose governments are
 known for their leftist views.
 5)  Students are being sent in increasing num-
 bers to Communist countries -- there are now
 approximately 60 in the USSR and the Bloc and 43
 in Cuba.
 6)  Measures to strengthen the party along
 Communist cell lines are being introduced, includ-
 ing Communist-supervised courses for organizers,
 and training of youth groups as security guards.
 General indoctrination courses are offered under
 the title Socialist Political Education, and a
 government socialist university is scheduled to
 open this fall.
 7)  Jagan (and mainly his wife) has recruited
 a number of foreign Communists and Communist
 sympathizers to assist him.  From Trinidad, Jack
 ICelshall, reported to be a Communist, is the gov-
 ernment's adv.a.ser for public relations and Jagants
 personal secretary.  WPC member Dr. Gyandhand
 (Indian) is on the government's planning commission.
 Several members of the CP of Great Britain have been
 imported to run PPP training courses, publications,
 and so forth.  Minister of Labor, Housing and Health,
 Ranji Chandisingh, was born in Trinidad, became a
 member o. the     in Great Britain, and was brought
 to British Guiana by Janet to edit Thunder some five

 667 AF,FF,NF.  Afro-Asian Journalist Conference Widens Sino-Soviet
 25X1 C10b           o-n# Tt__
 BACKGROUND:   Sponsored by the Indonesian Government, with
 Presi ear  Sarno as patron, the first Afro-Asian Journalist Con-
 ference (AAJC) opened in Djakarta on 24 April and closed in Bandung
 on 30 April. The Conference was preceded by an AAJC Preparatory
 Committee meeting held in Djakarta from 5 to 10 February 1963.
 The AMC endeavor stemmed from a meeting of the international
 Communist front International Organization of Journalists (IOJ)
 in Budapest in 1962, where 20 Afro-Asian countries agreed that
 Afro-Asian journalists should hold a meeting in Bandung.
 While the AAJC was ostensibly to be a meeting of professional
 journalists from Afro-Asian countries to discuss professional ques-
 tions, there were, not surprisingly, early indications that the
 Conference was to be a substitute and helpful precursor of a
 second Asian-African Bandung Conference of Heads of State, and
 that with Communist and pro-Communist groups having contributed
 their efforts toward organizing the Conference, they would utilize
 it as a propaganda platform against "imperialism" and "colonial-
 ism," for "national liberation," and give it a general anti-Western
 atmosphere.   It was also presumed that the Conference would permit
 the IOJ to gain additional influence in the ranks of Afro-Asian
 journalists; and it would show a great resemblance to the third
 Afro-Asian Solidarity (AAPSO) Conference held in Moshi, Tanganyika,
 4-11 February 1963 (see Bi-Weekly Propaganda Guidance #110, item
 625, dated 25 February 1963), in the general tenor of its resolu-
 tions and public statements with its pro-Communist orientation ex-
 pected to be even more marked.
 The Conference followed its predicted course, with the excep-
 tions that: it provided more of a display of the Sino-Soviet rift
 than anticipated; the Soviet-dominated IOJ "parent organization"
 found itself outmaneuvered and weakened,  if indeed not split, with
 the establishment of an Afro-Asian Journalist Association (AAJA.)
 and an Afro-Asian press Bureau, both to be headquartered in Djakarta-
 and the Indonesian sponsors, with apparent governmental consent,
 did the Chinese bidding in this Chicom-led, Chicom-oriented Con-
 ference which exceeded any previous Afro-Asian conference in its
 anti-US, anti-Western militancy.
 The Conference was attended by representatives from some 40
 Asian and African countries, and "observers" from the Soviet Union,
 other countries including Cuba, the All-Africa Journalist Associa-
 tion, and the IOJ.

 Communist Delegations Stack the Conference.             The Preparatory
 Comm tees .C se's o  delegates and  issued invitations indicated
 that only old hands at the business of stage-managed, Communist-
 controlled international conferences were to attend.   For example,
 the Indonesian government paid the way of a South Vietnamese dele-
 gate to Djakarta, but his seating was refused and instead a Commu-
 nist Viet Cong "liberation front" delegation was acknowledged as
 the legitimate representation of South Vietnam, in addition to the
 delegation of North Vietnam.  The North Korean delegation repre-
 sented North and South Korea; the invitation to the South Korean
 delegation "did not arrive."  The Secretary General of the National
 Press Club of Japan sent a telegram to President Sukarno stating
 that the Japanese delegation to the Conference was "thoroughly
 dominated by people committed to the support of the Communist bloc,"
 that the Japanese delegation represented only a small section of
 the Japanese press, and that the selection of its members was po-
 litically inspired.   (The telegram also stated that the Conference
 could facilitate Communist penetration of public information media
 throughout the Afro-Asian area.)  The delegate from Cameroun was
 an African student from Peking.  Some countries were doubly rep-
 resented:   there were, for instance, two delegations from Jordon,
 which promptly started quarrelling among themselves, etc.  There
 was no provision for a credentials committee.  When the issue was
 raised on the first day, it was brushed aside by the Indonesian
 Chairman (Djawoto, chief editor of the Indonesian Government's news
 agency ANTARA and chairman of the Indonesian Journalist Association)
 on the ground that the selection of delegates had been on the basis
 of "independent research."
 Methods of Control.   Such maneuvers became more explicit as
 the con erence procee- ed.   A panel of 20 names to constitute the
 conference presidium) was submitted by the Indonesian delegation
 and accepted by Djawoto without discussion.  Malaya, India, Mongolia
 and the Philippines objected to this "very undemocratic" nomination
 procedure in place of election as provided in the Conference rules,
 but they were overruled.
 The main controversy, however, arose over Mongolia's motion
 to accord membership to the Soviet Union, represented at the Con-
 ference by 10 delegates.   (The Preparatory Meeting had assigned
 "observer" status to the Soviet delegation with the final status
 to be resolved at the main conference.)  Eight countries backed
 the Mongolian motion, arguing in the main that a large part of Sbv-
 iet territory and population belonged to Asia.  There were immedi-
 ate protests, obviously pre-arranged.   After some time it was
 The presidium consisted of Indonesia, the CPR, Ceylon, North
 Borneo (independence movement), Syria, the UAR, Angola, North Korea,
 South Africa (in exile), Tanganyika, Mali, Japan, Pakistan, Niger,
 Sierra Leone, Ghana, Rhodesia, Kuwait, and South Vietnam (National
 Liberation Front).

 announced from the chair that with due regard to the "consensus?
 the USSR could only participate in observer status.   (As it turned
 our, the "consensus" was a formula used as a stick to beat down
 anything that the Chicoms and their supporters did not like.)  The
 chief of the Soviet delegation termed this decision of the Confer-
 ence "undemocratic" and "incomprehensible" but also said:   "We
 will always be with you in the struggle against imperialism and
 colonialism .... It
 The IOJ Loses influence:   Creation of the AAJA.   In accordance
 with plans of the Preparatory Meeting, the Conference decided to
 create an Afro-Asian Journalist Association (AAJA) whose constitu-
 tion says that "inspired by the Bandung spirit, the journalists
 from 40 countries of Asia and Africa decided upon the formation of
 their own association," and that the headquarters as well as a
 press bureau of the AAJA will be located in Djakarta.  The AAJA
 did not admit the Soviets, neither did it announce an affiliation
 with the IOJ.  The Mongolian delegation issued a statement of
 reservation (FBIS Daily, Indonesia, 3 May) in which it is stated
 inter alia:   "It is quite clear that without the participation of
 the  Sjournalists' organization, without widening the scope and
 cooperation with other progressive journalists' organizations, as
 for instance the IOJ (International Organization of Journalists)
 in which a number of journalists organizations from Asia and Africa
 are also participating, the Afro-Asian Journalist Association will
 not fully serve the cause of the strengthening of the unity and
 solidarity of the progressive and democratic journalistic forces
 from Asia and Africa as well as from the whole world."
 Whether the establishment of the AAJA represents an outright
 split of the IOJ remains to be seen; it may still announce an
 affiliation, however loose, with the IOJ and function quasi-
 independently in the Afro-Asian area.  There can be no questiop,
 however, that the Soviet-influenced IOJ has suffered a great loss
 of prestige and has been weakened.   If the Chicom hand had not
 been shown so strongly in the Conference as a whole as well as in
 the forming of the AAJA, one-could accept the appearance of the
 latter as still another indication of the growing emphasis on re-
 gional structures and activities within international Communist
 fronts -- an operational concept which began to develop when the
 world-wide fronts were becoming too compromised.  The status of
 the AAJA vis-a-vis the IOJ would seem to depend largely on general
 developments in the next few months in the relations between the
 Soviets and the Chicoms.  Not only will it be important to observe
 whether the AAJA gains stature and momentum, but also whether na-
 tional affiliations with it will be accompanied by severance of
 ties with the IOJ.  According to available reports only the Indian
 delegation failed to sign the "Djakarta Declaration" under which
 the AAJA was established; Malaya and the Philippines, which ini-
 tially were most unwilling to sign, at the last minute found them-
 selves stampeded into doing so.

 The constitution of the AAJA says that, inspired by the Bandung
 spirit, Afro-Asian journalists pursue the objective of establish-
 ing the closest of cooperation among themselves, the peoples and
 the respective governments, and strengthening their solidarity in
 the struggle for national independence against colonialism and im-
 perialism in all its forms and manifestations, and for world peace,
 justice,  freedom, and equality.
 Resolutions.   Amidst thunderous applause the meeting adopted
 some  p reso u ions which demonstrated a most militant spirit.
 Most of the resolutions were directed against imperialism and
 colonialism, with emphasis on the condemnation of US imperialism
 for its purported acts of aggression against and intervention and
 enslavement of Asian and African (and Latin American) countries.
 To note a few examples:
 Peace Corps.   A resolution condemning imperialist and neo-
 colonialist ac ivities noted with utmost regret the dispatch of
 US intelligence agents to Africa and Asia in the guise of the
 Peace Corps.
 Laos.  The resolution on the Laotian situation states:   "The
 Conference resolutely condemns the imperialist intervention in
 Laos' internal affairs and disruption of Laotian peace, neutrality,
 and independence; the Conference energetically condemns US im-
 perialism for assassinating Quinim Pholsena and other Laotian pa-
 triots; the Conference condemns US imperialism for its direct
 supplies of arms and aircraft to suppress the Laotian people and
 for launching attacks on the troops of the neutralist group and
 patriots.
 "The Conference resolutely demands that the US stop immediately
 its aggression against the intervention in Laos and withdraw all
 its troops, military personnel, and arms.   It resolutely demands
 that the US strictly observe the Geneva agreements and respect
 Laotian peace, neutrality and independence..."
 Korea.  The resolution on Korea says:  "The Afro-Asian jour-
 nalise,'  "conference holds that the occupation of South Korea by the
 US imperialists and their policy of aggression are the great ob-
 stacles to the peaceful unification of Korea and the cause of all
 the sufferings and misfortunes of the journalists and the people
 in South Korea and strongly demands the prompt withdrawal of the
 US imperialist aggressive army from South Korea..."
 South Vietnam.  The resolution on the situation in South Viet-
 nam concemns   a aggressive war, the policy of strategic hamlets
 of the US imperialists in South Vietnam, and particularly the use
 of noxious chemicals as ameans of war, destroying crops and animals,
 poisoning the health of the South Vietnamese people, in an attempt

 to exterminate the patriotic forces which are struggling for na-
 tional indepdpendence and peace in South Vietnam.  This aggressive
 war, considered as "experiemental war" by the US imperialists,
 severely threatens peace and national independence of the Afro-
 Asian peoples.
 Cuba.  The resolution on Cuba condemns the continued activities
 perpetrated against the Cuban people by the US imperialists.   It
 considers the five demands put forward by the Cuban Revolutionary
 Government as the just and minimum demands for the guarantee of
 peace in Cuba and the Caribbean.   It fully supports these five
 demands of the Cuban Revolutionary Government and the heroic Cuban
 people and calls upon all Afro-Asian journalists and people as
 well as all progressive mankind to do likewise.  The Conference
 further assured the valiant Cuban people and revolutionary govern-
 ment of its relentless and unreserved support and solidarity in
 their struggle against Yankee imperialism and the forces of reac-
 tion.
 Taiwan.  The resolution on Taiwan "condemns the US imperialist
 occupation of Taiwan, the territory of the CPR."  It condemns the
 US imperialists for creating tension in the Taiwan Strait and
 menacing peace in Asia and the world, and firmly demands that the
 US imperialists and their armed forces immediately withdraw from
 the Taiwan. Strait.
 (North Borneo)
 Similar resolutions deal with North Kalimantar; Angola; South
 Africa; Southwest Africa; the high commission territories of
 Basutoland, Bechuanaland and Swaziland; Rhodesia and Nyasaland;
 Zanzibar; Portuguese Guinea, etc.
 Military Pacts. The resolution condemning military pacts "calls
 upon     an-  r can peoples to double their efforts and unite their
 forces by all means in the struggle for the liquidation of all
 military pacts and bases on the Asian-African continents, to call
 upon the governments concerned to discontinue any negotiation with
 the imperialist countries toward the formation of an aggressive
 military alliance."
 The resolution on ending of colonialism urges the governments
 of the countries of Asia and Africa to set up soon an Asian-African
 commission to look into individual cases of colonial or imperialist
 occupation still continuing in the region and to take effective
 steps for their early liqu?.daation.
 Israel.  A resolution on Israel condemns "the role played by
 Isra'd1  's an agent of world imperialism, condemns the military
 and nuclear aid, given by the USA to Israel, and supports the rights
 of the Arab Palestine refugees to regain their country which was
 grabbed by imperialism to create the artificial state of Israel."
 Bandung Conference.  The resolution on the second Bandung con-
 ference stresses the need of further strengthening the solidarity
 and cooperation of the Asian-African governments  the objective

 of speeding up the complete liquidation of colonialism and neo-
 colonialism on both continents, and expresses full support for
 the efforts to convene the second Bandung conference at the earli-
 est possible date.  The conference appeals to all Asian-African
 journalists to urge their respective governments to take positive
 steps for the convening of this conference of Afro-Asian govern-
 ments.
 A-A Conferences. A resolution supports the holding of the
 third  Asian-African writers conference in Indonesia in 1963, the
 holding of an Asian-African film festival next year, and the idea
 of convening a conference of trade unions of Africa and Asia in
 accordance with the Bandung spirit.
 Ganefo.  The resolution on Ganefo (Games of the New Emerging
 Forces)  welcomes and supports the idea initiated by Indonesia to
 convene the games of the new emerging forces, in which sportsmen
 and sportswomen of the progressive countries of Africa, Asian, and
 Latin America and the socialist countries would take part."
 Three Continent Journalists Conference.  The Conference also
 called for the holding of an Asian-Africa-Latin American Jour-
 nalists Conference in Cuba.

 Negro Problem:  Evasions and Solution
 Those who call for an immediate and to racial discrimination
 in the United States and for full equality for the Negro strike a
 responsive chord in many breasts.  What they do not say, however,
 is that in making this demand, they are asking for something more
 than the issuance of laws and the use of state powers -- they are
 asking for a change in human attitudes.  Liberal Americans believe
 that this change can  a accomplishe"d-,uauut there are no successful
 precedents to follow, and if the change is made with nothing
 worse than the Birmingham riots, Americans may count themselves
 fortunate.
 In other areas of the world it has been possible to solve
 racial or other minority problems by other means.  One favorite
 solution is the expulsion of the minority group; this has been
 applied in India (the Moslems), and Algeria and Kenya (the settlers),
 But even in these cases the solution was only accozir.~lished after
 serious bloodshed.  Another solution is secession, as applied by
 the former African and Asian non-settlement colonies of European
 empires, or by Ireland, Iceland, Norway or Cyprus.  This method
 is good where applicable, but life the expulsion solution, is hardly
 practical for the United States.  One element in the American
 Black Muslim program is said to be the establishment of a black
 nation within the American South, but most Negroes recognize that
 such a ghetto arrangement would be economically disastrous.  One
 could almost say that these procedures are not solutions to racial
 and minority problems, but rather ova.sions of them.  Such solu-
 tions are accomplished, not by reconciling the races, but by
 separating them.  Those who are in the fortunate position of being
 able painlessly to apply the separation technique should hesitate
 a moment before criticizing those who are unable to apply it, or
 who could only apply it by imposing gross hardships.
 The closest parallel to the American problem is that existing
 in South Africa.  Here the separation technique (Apartheid) is
 being applied internally, and it is in fact impos$ix; '..adships.
 Americans have largely come to recognize that internal separation
 is dangerous and unjust, and they are moving away from separation
 or segregation, as it is called in the United States.  Any other
 procedure would create explosive conditions (as indeed is happen-
 ing in South Africa), and would not serve the long-term interests
 of either race.  But the reconciliation of races requires a high
 degree of maturity on both sides, and it is scarcely surprising
 that some individuals fail to rise to this standard.
 It is worth remembering that attitudes on such matters as race
 are largely acquired in early childhood, and that those who acquire
 these attitudes may live on for three-quarters of a century.  There
 are men now in leading positions in the South who can remember when
 lynchings were frequent occur:-nc3     (161 negro lynchings in 1892),
 and when the Ku Klux Klan was a real, and not just imaginary, power.
 Southern whites are justly proud of the military record of the
 Confederacy, and it is easy for them to look back with nostalgia to
 the "Old South," forgetting the harshness and exploitation that
 supported the plantation system.  No one readily admits that he
 and his forefathers have been wrong all their lives.  White South-
 erners have, by and urge, changed in their attitudes tremendously
 in the last forty years; they cannot be compared with, say, the
 rigid colons of French Algeria.  But a few have not changed and
 more are (raid, and hence the course of gradual progress is
 occasionally punctuated with Little Rocks and Birminghams.
 Some say that if there is resistance to desegregation, so much
 the worse for it:  it must be destroyed.   It is to be suspected
 that many of those who take this view have their own ends to serve,
 which are not these of racial equality but those of gaining political
 power.  At any rate, we would note that a radical solution was in
 fact attempted once in the United States.  After the Civil War,-
 Negroes voted freely and were elected to state offices and to Con-
 gress,                In South Carolina, Negroes at one time outnumbered whites
 in the state legislature.  This was possible because Federal.
 troops occupied the South and protected the Negroes.  But the whites
 were not?i~:,:ta11y prepared to recognize the Negroes as equals.  The

 Ku Klux Klan sprang up to intimidate the Negroes, and after Federal
 troops were withdrawn in 1877, the Negro gradually returned to a
 position little better than slavery, reaching his nadir in the 1890AL
 The point is that there are no easy solutions to questions
 like the racial problem in the United States.   If a solution is
 advanced which looks easy, it is only a pseudo-solution,.  Americans
 are making slow but real progress toward a real solution to this
 problem.  We do not know of any other country which, faced by a
 similar problem, can say as much.

 THE NEW LEADER
 Revolution in an Open Society
 By Reinhold Niebuhr
 The Negro revolution, which is daily gathering force and un-
 doubtedly will gather more force before it reaches its objectives
 and finally spends itself in fulfillment, is an interesting his-
 torical phenomenon.   It is a revolution within the framework of a
 democratic society.
 If historical phenomena were as neat and orderly as our cate-
 gories of history, revolutions would occur only in moribund tradi-
 tional societies where there is no free and mutual adjustment of
 interests and where the most defrauded segment of the community
 cannot move to-attain its rights without shattering the whole rigid
 structure of a hierarchial community.  We know of the revolutions
 in 17th century England, 18th century France and'20th century Russia
 Yet even in those revolutions the peasants and the rising craftsmen
 arose as a revolutionary force only when internal strains and
 external exertions weakened the old order and gave them an oppor-
 tunity to do so.
 The motive power of their revolutionary actions was resentment
 against'agc;-old grievances and injustices, borne "patiently" until
 deliverance seemed near; and 'the hopes generated by cracks in the
 old order.' Revolutionary ardor is never, as Marx thought, pure
 resentment.   It is a combination of resentment and hope.  That is
 why revolutionary movements become more revolutionary in the process
 of their success.  We should know about this double motive of
 revolutions as we watch the Negro revolution in its ups and downs,
 and begin to wonder why, as it meets with comparative success, it is
 developing more and more force.
 Nor should we have too much difficulty in accounting for the
 strange ph .nomenon of a Negro revolution taking place in an open
 society, rather than in a traditional one.  An open society pre-
 vents revolutions by allowing all economic, racial and cultural
 .groups freedom to state their claims and defend their interests.
 The claims may not always be granted, or the interests acknowledged.
 But in a truly democratic society there is always some hope that
 genuine interests will gradually be recognized, and that in a spirit
 of mutual accommodation failure to grant them will be justified by
 their clearly interfering with other legitimate interests.
 Thus, democratic communities are subject to an evolutionary
 process of adjustment, and not revolutions of the dispossessed. The
 current Negro revolution can be understood only if it is realized
 that the Negroes. comprise a disinherited enclave in a free'society.
 They bear the same unsatisifed longings of the ages, the same ac-
 cumulated resentments against unredressed injustices, which the
 peasants of the ossified traditional communities bore in past cen-
 turies and which, according to`Marx, the "proletariat' bore.  But,
 happily,-democratic society redressed these conditions, making the
 Marxist aprocalypse of doom and utopia otiose throughout the whole
 of Western Europe.  Of course, Western culture required a whole
 century to come to terms with the realities of modern industry. The
 mills of both God and democracy grind exceedingly slowly.
 The Negroes, however, were left out of.all, or at any rate
 most, of the beneficient consequences of this fluid evolutionary
 process.  Despite the promises of a'nation "conceived in liberty and
 dedicated to the proposition that'all men are created equal," they
 lived in slavery in the self-conscious and self righteous young
 nation "brought forth" on a new continent .  Despite the fact that
 the slavery issue caused the Civil War, the victory of the North
 did more to "save the union," acknowledged by Lincoln to be his
 "primary purpose," than to emancipate the Negroes.  Despite the
 assurances of the Fourteenth Amendment, Negroes remained both.right-
 less and powerless-in the sense that they were voteless.
 After the Civil War, even the free states did not hasten to
 enfranchise Negroes under the Fourteenth Amendment'.  And today, a
 century later, most of the riots in the.South are due to efforts,
 to give Negroes the vote.  These facts are almost too obvious to be

 sympathetic whites must be remainded, as we recently have been by the
 gifted Negro novelist James Baldwin, of the historical reasons.for
 the depth and breadth and virulence of Negro resentments.
 The enclave of hopeless injustice in our generally open society
 obviously has its core in the "deep South" -- in Mississippi and Ala-
 bama and, in varying degrees, other states of the old Confederacy.
 But it also encompasses the entire nation, particularly the Northern
 urban centers to which the Southern Negroes fled.  Here they are
 "emancipated," in the sense that they can vote, while being newly
 enslaved, in the sense that they must live in ghettos such as Harlem.
 Still, these enclaves of injustice are in a community that is
 otherwise 'open."  indeed, some of the effects of the present inte-
 gration controversy stem from the contradictory influences of an open
 society containing a closed enclave.  Birmingham illustrates the
 situation most poignantly.  Under Martin Luther King's leadership,
 the Negroes conducted mass demonstrations against all forms of
 segregation.  A joint interracial committee finally resolved the
 "tension" by promising desegregation of the large downtown depart-
 ment store facilities, promotion of Negroes to sales positions, and
 the formation of a permanent commission on race relations.  These
 were the consequences of an open society allowing competition and
 accommodation of conflicting interests.
 But on the night the accord was reached, a group of recalcitrant
 whites, opposed to opening the closed enclave, bombed the house of
 a Negro leader and the motel where the committee had met.  Earlier,
 the same sort of men murdered a pure-hearted mail carrier who was
 carrying a message about the necessity for integration to the
 Governor of Alabama.  A group of Birmingham Negroes, enraged by the
 bombing, went beserk, rioted and ruthlessly laid waste to several
 homes and businesses.  Curiously -- or perhaps not so curiously --
 these Negroes were not part of the group which had won accommodation
 from the whites.  They were a group of hopeless men for whom the
 promise of Negro job opportunities seemed worthless, because they
 would be unemployed in any case.  They spoke from the depths of the
 enclave of hopelessness.
 Both the open society and the enclave of hopeless injustice will
 continue to have their contradictory effects.  Whites, along with
 Negroes who retain hope of getting justice, will rejoice that this
 is not South Africa and that the only conceivable conclusion of the
 struggle is not a blood bath of violent revolution.  An open society
 will in time encroach upon the boundaries of the enclave.  Negroes
 with votes will use their power in favor of Negroes without votes.
 TT:ue, some of them may be demagogic Congressmen with unsavory
 records of racism in reverse.  But, it should be remembered, we are
 dealing with outraged-human beings, not with angels of virtue.
 Some Negroes have already escaped from the enclave of prejudice
 by dint of extraordinary talent -- in sports, in the theater, in the
 concert hall.! This is,. to be sure, a bitter irony in this form of
 injustice.  But even now only the most talented women are able to
 establish "equal rights" with men in politics and business.  What is
 significant is that Negroes with high talent are breaking out of the
 enclave in increasing numbers, thus revealing the virtue of an open
 society, enlarging its openness, and refuting the libel about the
 "innate inferiority" of their race.
 Another result of an open society is that, despite the educa-
 tional handicaps from which the present drive for educational inte-
 gration may ultimately rescue them, an ever greater number of Negroes
 are getting a university education either in Negro or integrated
 colleges.  And these college students, especially in their sit-in
 protests against segregated eating places but also in the general
 agitation for justice, are performing the same service for their
 race which the articulate craftsmen performed for the less articulate
 peasants in the late middle ages and in the revolutions which
 established free governments.

 These are the obvious consequences of the openness of our
 society.  But the forces of tradition and custom, which uphold
 special privileges for a dominant race, are still powerful enough
 to preserve the enclaves of injustice for a century or more to
 come.  We will have the tension of the integration struggle with
 us as long as we live in the precarious peace of the nuclear
 dilemma.  The Negroes will naturally be impatient, and their im-
 patience will hasten the process of justice and embarrass the
 "moderates."
 Strangely enough, the only true proponents of a neat "class
 struggle" between the reces are the Black Muslims, who believe
 Allah will perform the service which Marx expected from the "his-
 torical dialectic"; that is, guarantee them a black paradise in
 the nation.  Since there is no "increasing misery" among Negroes
 in this country, however, there is no increasing revolutionary
 ardor, only constant pressure.  We shall live for a long time with
 this pressure and with the contradictory consequences of a revolu-
 tion in an open society.
 Attorney General Robert Kennedy was probably too optimistic
 in his recent analogy between the history of the Irish and the
 Negroes in America.  After pointing out that an Irish Catholic
 was elected President less than a century after the anti-Irish
 riots of the "know nothing" movement, he predicted that a Negro
 could be elected President in another half century.  But the
 analogy is not exact.  The Irish merely affronted us by having a
 different religion and a different place of origin than the "true"
 Americans.  The Negroes affront us by diverging from the dominant
 type all too obviously.  Their skin is black.  And our celebrated
 reason is too errant to digest the difference.

 THE NEW REPUBLIC
 July 9, 1962
 The Negro Problem:  A Prognosis
 by Gunnar Myrdal
 As we can now look back over the era of Reconstruction with
 the wisdom of hindsight, we see clearly that the reason why so
 much went wrong and why so little permanent improvement of the lot
 of the Negroes in the South resulted was this:   that the political
 revolution was not backed up by economic and social reform.  As
 usual the leaders of that time tried to do great things too cheaply
 without paying the costs.  The slogan "six acres and a mule" was
 never taken seriously by those in power-- just as in most of the
 underdeveloped countries of the world today land and tenancy re-
 forms are proposed as programs and sometimes even enacted into
 law, but frustrated and nullified by the resistance of the vested
 interests.
 In America this type of Reconstruction led to the great na-
 tional compromise worked out in the late 1870's.  The Negro people
 were left again to the mercy of the White upper caste  in the South,
 now embittered by all that had followed their military defeat.
 Economically, the South deteriorated to a colonial status in its
 relation to the North, and as late as the Thirties Franklin
 Roosevelt could still characterize the South as the nation's "Prob-
 lem number one. "
 Until the end of the Thirties the status of the Negro people
 remained on the whole about unchanged.  There were advances on
 some fronts, but retreats on others.  Twenty years ago this era of
 relative stagnation so far as the Negroes' position is concerned
 had so impressed itself on American thinking that even the social
 scientists had generally come to believe that it was the natural
 order of things.  Progress was foredoomed to be very gradual and
 slow, they believed, and nothing very much could be done to speed
 it up.   In mi~  study of the Negro problem in America at that time
 I came to the contrary conclusion, however, that this period of
 stagnation was only a temporary balancing of forces which was just
 on the verge of being broken.   I saw big changes in the offing.
 And, as we know, this actually happened.  These last 20 years
 have been filled with advances on all fronts:    in the labor market,
 in education, in the fields of social welfare and housing, in the
 structure of law and law observance, and generally in the enjoyment
 of more equal opportunities to do things, to move in society, to
 work, produce and consume without meeting segregation and discrimi-
 nation.  No historical trend of social change is a straight line,
 and there have been occasional setbacks.  Prejudice itself is also
 slow to disappear, though its legal and institutional retaining
 walls are crumbling.  There is still a long road to travel before
 America becomes in fact the egalitarian country of its creed.  But
 in historical perspective the rapidty of progress is astonishing.
 Let us remember that practically all of this progress has taken
 place in the short period of the last 20 years, following six
 decades of stagnation -- and that its coming was not anticipated
 by most students of the American scene.
 The progressive achievements of recent years have not been won
 without efforts.   in the general advance unfortunate incidents occur
 which deeply disturb the participants.   In a sense, unpleasant
 incidents even have a function to fulfill in this process of advance.
 In the last chapter of An American Dilemma I quoted a remark once
 made to me by a prominent an   conservative Negro social scientist
 in the South; I can now reveal that the man I characterized in this
 way was my late friend Charles S. Johnson, the great sociologist
 and the first Negro president of Fisk University.  He stated as his
 considered opinion that tensions are not necessarily bad and that
 unddr certain conditions even race riots may have wholesome effects
 in the long run.  He continued in about the following way.

 race situation should ever become fixed, if the Negro were really
 accommodated, then, and only then, would I despair about a con-
 tinued great improvement for Negroes.  As long as there is friction
 and fighting, there is hope."
 In this light, the Little Rock disturbances and the many other
 unfortunate incidents reported daily in the American press have
 their positive role to play in giving momentum to social advance.
 I realize that it is much easier for an outsider to take this lofty
 philosophical view than it is for the American citizen who has a
 duty to take a part in pressing social advance as rapidly as possi..
 ble.  And it must be particularly difficult for the young Negro
 intellectual who bears scars in his soul from all that yet remains
 of segregation and discrimination in American life.  Nevertheless
 I maintain that it is important to see clearly that the trend moves
 steeply upwards, in order to avoid discouragement and to sustain
 the determination required in the skirmishing that may still be
 necessary.   In this new epoch the Negro cause is a winning one.
 I have not the slightest doubt that we shall continuously see
 great improvement in the Negro's status in American society, and I
 even foresee that the rising trend of the past two decades will
 accelerate.   It would take me far afield to explain all my reasons
 for this conviction.  But, among them, on the material side, is the
 growing affluence of a society which provides more elbow room for
 everybody and has little interest in pushing anybody into the ditch.
 On the spiritual side, there is the reality of the ideals enshrined
 in your constitution and rooted in the hearts of the American people.
 With rising levels of education the hold of these ideals in America
 is continuously strengthened.   Increasingly, the false and derogatory
 beliefs about Negroes, which have filled the function of rationalizes
 ing prejudices, can be expressed only by those willing to betray
 their own lack of culture.  As the white and Negro people are
 increasingly mingling in work and pleasure, all are discovering that
 they are the same sort of people with the same cultural moorings,
 the same likes and dislikes, and the same aspirations and ambitions
 for themselves and for America.
 Just as until women are completely emancipated, every ambitious
 woman has also to stand for women's rights, so even today every
 Negro intellectual must feel called upon to supplement his work in
 his chosen vocation by being a "race man."  This situation will
 remain until Negroes are generally accepted everywhere on a par with
 whites.
 I should not be fully candid with you, if at this point I did
 not stress another implication of the integration of the Negroes in
 the wider American society, namely that the Negro professional middle
 and upper class will have to surrender economic monopolies which
 they have held, and are still holding, on the basis of prejudice.
 You cannot cry for the breaking down of the walls of segregation and
 discrimination while, at the same time, hoping to retain 'Petty
 monopoly preserves among Negro clientele to give you a comfortable
 and uncontested economic safety.  You must have the courage to
 choose a harder life in which your abilities will be tested against
 the norms established in the wider American society, and indeed in
 the whole world.
 In the future America... there will be no place for a Negro
 university.
 As the integration process proceeds the problems of the Negroes
 will gradually tend to disappear as separate problems.  For a long
 time yet, there will undoubtedly be problems of breaking down
 segregation and discrimination against Negro families in housing.
 But the general problem of slum clearance in American cities is the
 bigger and more important one.  And the Negro's stake in that bigger
 problem is the greater as there is no hope for a satisfactory sepa-
 rate solution to the housing problems of Negroes as long as slums
 remain a blot in American cities.  The schools most Negro children
 attend are bad in the South and often in some parts of the North,
 but many other schools are also bad, and the best hope for Negroes,
 particularly in this period of desegregation, is a campaign for
 improving the  checks  en           L   w'                              .of

 which America is still rather backward (particularly in the field
 of health and hospitalization) by comparison with the most advanced
 countries.   In this situation it is both natural and necessary that
 Negroes should support and join those forces in American society
 which stand for general social and economic progress.  When narrower
 group interests are submerged and the pursuit of social advance for
 the white community is brought to the fore, a major step toward the
 complete integration of Negroes in American society will have been
 taken.
 It probably still is broadly true, though less now than 20 to
 30 years ago, that the Negroes are the "last hired and the first
 fired," and the incidence of unemployment of Negro workers is
 disproportionately heavy.  The state of full employment, created
 by the war and preserved in the immediate postwar years, was of
 great importance on the economic side in supporting the rising trend
 in the Negrots status.  The relative economic stagnation in America
 and the high level of unemployment in the Fifties is, for the same
 reason, particularly menacing for Negro advance.   If continued
 stagnation should be the lasting condition for the American economy
 in the decades to come it will spell frustration internally and
 externally for America, and it might even slow down the upward
 trend of the Negro advance I have talked about.  When I have ex-
 pressed my faith that the trend to improvement of the Negroes' status
 will continue and indeed gather momentum, I have done so because
 I cannot believe that the American people will tolerate a stagnating
 economy for much longer.   It is not necessary.  Any economist worth
 his salt can tell you what is needed in the field of public policy
 to make America again a country of bold and rapid economic progress.
 To fight discrimination against Negroes in the labor market
 remains naturally a task that cannot be relaxed.  But much more
 important is the recreation of the conditions for American economic
 progress, as nothing is more effective in liquidating discrimination
 than full employment and a rising trend of incomes to all.
