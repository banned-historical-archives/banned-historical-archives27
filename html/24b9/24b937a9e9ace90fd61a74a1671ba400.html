 25X1
 No other military actions were reported in the Tehran area, and it is not certain whether the security
 forces moved under instructions from Prime Minister
 Bakhtiar.   The Tehran domestic radio service stopped
 broadcasting early this morning.                       25X1
 Bakhtiar was planning steps to seize the initiative
 from the opposition before Khomeini's intended return.
 Progovernment demonstrations were being organized in
 Tehran and other cities; they could lead to            St-a-4-

 The Shah's Activities
 The Shah evidently is moving to take a stronger role
 the Shah will return to Egypt and hopes that
 he can use it as a staging point.                        25X1
 The Shah undoubtedly is in touch with senior mili-
 tary and SAVAK officials in Iran and probably is aware
 of the coup plotting under way.   He probably hopes that
 if Prime Minister Bakhtiar's government is unable to deal
 with Khomeini, the military will invite the Shah to re-
 turn to restore order.   If the Shah encourages the mili-
 tary to seize power on his behalf, the chances that hard-
 line officers will mount a coup would be significantly
 increased.                                                      25X1
 Many Iranians would blame the US for any move by
 the Shah to return or for a military takeover on his
 behalf.                                                                25X1
 Sadat views the Shah as a close personal friend and
 may hope that from Cairo the Shah will be able to influ-
 ence events in Iran during the coming months.   The Shah's
 return to Egypt, however,  could generate protests from
 political and religious extremists.                                    25X1
 During the Shah's recent stay in Aswan, leftists
 distributed leaflets denouncing him as a tool of the CIA.
 Last month, a series of minor demonstrations reportedly
 were mounted by followers of the conservative Muslim
 Brotherhood protesting public expressions of support for
 the Shah by a leading government-appointed religious
 leader.                                                         25X1
 The US could also be the target of criticism gener-
 ated by the Shah's presence.   Ambassador Eilts reports
 that, as the situation in Iran has deteriorated, there
 has been a marked increase in suspicion and animosity
 toward the US on the part of orthodox Egyptian Muslims
 who apparently believe the US is hostile toward Islam.

 Thai leaders,  reluctant to antagonize either China
 or Vietnam,  are maintaining a neutral position on the
 conflict in Kampuchea.   Because of the unexpected scale
 and speed of the Vietnamese invasion,  Thailand initially
 seemed prepared to accept Vietnam's takeover as an ac-
 complished fact.   There are tentative signs,  however,25X1

 ISRAEL-LEBANON:   Cease-Fire Agreement
 Ambassador Lewis last night reported from Tel Aviv
 that Israel and the PLO have agreed to halt the five-day
 old artillery and rocket exchanges along the Israeli-
 Lebanese border.   If a cease-fire is maintained, it could
 bring at least a temporary end to the worst period of 25X1
 shelling,  terrorist incidents, and other military ac-
 tions in the troubled region since the Israeli incur-
 sion into southern Lebanon last spring.
 Lebanese Prime Minister Huss told Ambassador Dean
 in Beirut late last night that PLO leader Arafat had
 ordered Palestinian forces to stop firing.   Huss asked
 that the US pass word of the cease-fire order to the
 Israelis.   Israeli Defense Minister Weizman, who agreed
 to arrange the cease-fire to become effective as of 2300
 EST last night,  said he noted that the situation along
 f-hp border ha.         quiet since late yesterday afternoon.
 25X1
 A cease-fire may require some time to take hold.
 Arafat apparently told Huss that, while he had issued
 the command, word had not yet filtered down to all Pal-
 estinian units.   It is possible that some Palestinians
 will not comply.

 MOROCCO-MAURITANIA:   Troop Withdrawal
 Moroccan King Hassan is beginning to withdraw the
 military forces he sent to Mauritania in 1977 to help
 fight Algerian-backed Polisario Front guerrillas.   The
 withdrawal is likely to proceed cautiously,  allowing
 Hassan time to assess the attitude of the post-Boumediene
 regime in Algiers and that of the guerrillas toward ne-
 gotiating a settlement to the Western Sahara conflict.
 25X1
 Three basic considerations now make a negotiated
 settlement more attractive to Hassan:   the apparent de-
 cision by Mauritania's military leaders to abandon the
 struggle against the Polisario;  the death of Boumediene,
 who made the Polisario cause a matter of personal
 prestige;  and the evaporation of popular enthusiasm
 in Morocco for a military solution.                      25X1
 Hassan seems to recognize that keeping Moroccan
 forces in Mauritania in the face of the Mauritanian
 Government's requests for their departure would only
 further damage relations.   He may also now believe that
 the political costs of using Moroccan forces to block
 a formal unilateral peace between Mauritania and the
 guerrillas would be prohibitive.                            25X1
 The de facto truce between Mauritania and the
 Polisario, moreover, has largely eliminated the need for
 Moroccan troops to protect Mauritanian rail lines and
 industrial sites.   As a result, Hassan's military
 commanders may have urged disengagement in Mauritania
 in order to free additional Moroccan forces for service
 in the Moroccan-controlled sector of Western Sahara,
 where the guerrillas remain very active.
 Moroccan forces were sent to Mauritania under
 agreements concluded with the Mauritanian civilian regime
 that was ousted last July.   There are now 8,000 to 9,000
 Moroccan soldiers in Mauritania and in the Mauritanian-
 claimed part of Western Sahara.                             25X1

 ITALY:   Communists' Options
 Communist chief Ber-
 znguer s a visers are urging him to ask by tomorrow for
 a summit meeting of the five parties comprising the
 Andreotti government's parliamentary majority.   BerZinguer
 would apparently use the meeting to set the stage for
 Communist withdrawal from the majority--and blame the
 Christian Democrats for failin   to Zive up to the five-
 party parliamentary accord.                                     25X1
 Berlinguer is still reluctant to bring down the gov-
 ernment and force an early parliamentary election, both
 likely results of the Communists' withdrawal.   Other
 Communist leaders, however,  consider the current situa-
 tion intolerable, primarily because the government ig-
 nored their recommendations concerning several major pol-
 icy decisions.   Berlinguer's tough line apparently is de-
 signed in part to mollify rank-and-file dissatisfaction
 with the leadership's support of the government prior
 to the party congress slated for March.
 Berlinguer's supporters have recommended that he   25X1
 launch an attack soon against Christian Democratic con-
 duct in government,  thus preparing the ground for Com-
 munist withdrawal.     Some of his advisers want to avoid
 having the break occur in connection with the parlia-
 mentary debate beginning on Monday over the government's
 economic plan.   They fear this would enable the Christian
 Democrats to accuse the Communists of ignoring Italy's
 most pressing problems.                                            25X1
 For its part,  the leadership of the Christian Demo-
 crats has reaffirmed its commitment to the current
 governing arrangement and its willingness to discuss dif-
 ferences with the other parties.   The Christian Democrats,
 however,  insist that these discussions focus on the
 government's economic plan rather than the makeup of the
 government.

 NORTH KOREA - SOUTH KOREA:   Pyongyang's Proposal
 As a counteroffer to South Korean President Pak's
 recent call for North-South talks,  North Korea yesterday
 proposed a meeting of representatives of all political
 parties and mass organizations of the two Koreas.   The
 North Korean proposal seems designed to convey a sense
 of flexibility, and it presents problems for the South.
 A period of heightened tactical maneuvering by the two
 sides seems in prospect.                             25X1
 North Korea proposes that both sides begin a series
 of actions to ease tension and that preliminary talks
 start in June to prepare for a meeting in early September
 in Pyongyang or Seoul of various political groups.   The
 North Koreans specifically invited Pak but as president
 of the Democratic Republican Party rather than as head
 of state.                                                    25X1
 North Korea may have calculated that resumption of
 a dialogue might accelerate US troop withdrawals,            limit
 the amount of US compensatory military assistance to
 South Korea, and perhaps lay the groundwork for eventual
 contacts with the US.   The North probably feels some
 need to counter recent publicity in the US over the
 sizable increases in estimates of its order of battle.
 It may also see its proposal as a means of keeping the
 initiative on the Korea question during Chinese Vice
 Premier Deng Xiao in  's  (Ten   Hsiao-ping's)  coming visit
 to the US.                                            25X1
 North Korea's latest proposal presents difficulties
 for the Pak government, which may well believe that
 North Korea's plan is designed to undercut the legiti-
 macy of the South Korean Government.                                   South Korea, none-
 theless, probably feels under considerable pressure now
 to avoid a premature negative reaction.     If so, a period
 of heightened tactical maneuvering seems likely by both
 sides while they consider ways of addressing the issues

 PERU:   Relations with Neighbors
 Peru's expulsion of the Chilean Ambassador and its
 strong protest over Ecuador's alleged maltreatment of
 a group of Peruvians are demonstrations of Lima's hard-
 ening stance toward its southern and northern neighbors.
 If continued,  this new truculence,  which stems  largely
 from the growing assertiveness and influence of hard-
 line officers,  could Zead to increased tension among the
 Andean nations,  especially because this year will mark
 the centennial of Peru's militar    defeat by Chile in the
 War of the Pacific.                                           25X1
 The Peruvians on Saturday declared the Chilean
 envoy persona non grata to protest acts of espionage
 committed by Chilean diplomats and naval personnel late
 last year.   On the same day, the government executed a
 Peruvian airman convicted of helping the Chileans acquire
 information.                                                  25X1
 Peruvian Army General Richter, who directed the
 government's forceful handling of a recent general
 strike attempt,  led the push for firm action.           Scheduled
 to become Peru's prime minister on 1 February, he will
 undoubtedly be determined to project an image of tough-
 ness at home and abroad.   He is supported by a number
 of officers who think President Morales Bermudez has
 frequently been indecisive.                                   25X1
 Peru's responses are out of proportion to the low
 level of the espionage incidents, and Chile has so far
 taken the expulsion calmly.   The Chileans had tacitly
 acknowledged the spying charges, but they had expected
 LDk I
 Peru has also lashed out at the Ecuadoreans, who
 had earlier arrested some seven Peruvians, apparently
 on charges of espionage.   Peru charges that the Ecuador-
 eans tortured the prisoners to extract military infor-
 mation, and in its formal protest has demanded an ex-
 planation.

 HUNGARY-USSR:   No Raw Material Agreement
 Hungary has been unable to persuade the USSR to
 increase raw material shipments to Hungary for the 1981-
 85 plan period or to provide Hungary with a $1-billion
 loan,  presumably to finance increased purchases from the
 USSR.
 The USSR has offered to continue deliveries of raw
 materials at the 1980 level and was noncommital about a
 loan.   The Soviets, moreover, want to stop paying for a
 portion of their agricultural imports from Hungary in   25X1
 hard currency and substitute transferable rubles, begin-
 ning in 1981.   The USSR also has insisted that Hungary
 invest more in developing Soviet natural resources.
 Hungary,  already heavily burdened by payments for
 oil from the Middle East, will have added hard currency
 problems if it cannot increase its purchases of raw ma-
 terials from the Soviet Union.   Hungarian officials re-
 port that a stagnation in deliveries of raw materials
 will hurt the next five-year plan, when the rate of
 growth is expected to be only 3 to 3.5 percent compared
 with an average of over 5 percent in the 1976-80 plan
 period.   Other East European countries also are attempt-
 ing to arrange such agreements with the Soviets but so
 far have been unsuccessful.

 The UN Committee on Disarmament convenes today in
 Geneva for its first session since being renamed, reor-
 ganized, and expanded to 40 members.   Algeria will be
 the first to serve as the Committee's chairman, a ro-
 tating position that has replaced the permanent US-USSR
 cochairmanship.   France, represented by Foreign Minister
 Francois-Poncet, will participate for the first time
 since 1960.   China will not be represented but has
 reserved the right to take its seat.   There are indi-
 cations that the USSR and its allies might challenge
 this arrangement;  the "Group of 21" developing countries
 and the Committee's Western members apparently will
 support China's request.   A limit on the use of chemical
 weapons and a comprehensive nuclear test ban will be the
 main topics of discussion.
 Scandinavian countries, which in earlier years sup-
 ported the Hanoi regime, probably will complete projects
 now under way in Vietnam, but will delay future economic
 aid until Vietnam withdraws from Kampuchea.   Parliamen-
 tary debates are scheduled this week in Sweden and
 Norway where public anti-Vietnam sentiment has been
 growing.   Swedish Prime Minister Ullsten said the pace
 of Vietnam's withdrawal will influence decisions on future
 Swedish aid.   A Norwegian Foreign Ministry official
 said Norway will consider halting current projects if
 Vietnamese forces threaten to cross the Thai border.
 The Danish Government also has decided to freeze addi-
 tional aid to Vietnam,  including $30 million that had
 already been budgeted for that purpose.

 NATO:   Reactions to Guadeloupe
 The concern and suspicion being voiced by the NATO
 governments that were excluded from the Guadeloupe sum-
 mit was intense Zast week.   Some representatives said
 the health of the Alliance's consultative process--which
 keeps tension within reasonable bounds and reinforces
 trust--is at stake.                                          25X1
 The concerns of the excluded members were compounded
 by what they considered to be an inadequate briefing on
 the summit at the meeting of the North Atlantic Council
 on 9 January.   The meeting last week of the Guadeloupe
 participants to talk about aid to Turkey--a discussion
 begun at Guadeloupe--also served to heighten suspicions.
 The criticism was directed at all four of the states
 that participated in the summit--the US, the UK, France,
 and West Germany.                                                   25X1
 Canada's Permanent Representative led off a NATO
 session on 16 January by observing that NATO's consulta-
 tion process had been in a state of decline prior to the
 Guadeloupe summit, but that Guadeloupe had made matters
 worse.   NATO Secretary General Luns was more direct:   he
 said NATO consultations had "failed" in recent months
 and went on to point to the increasing number of re-
 stricted multilateral consultations as a symptom of that
 Luns also noted that developments in Africa and
 Iran had been ignored in NATO forums and expressed con-
 cern over the lack of consultation about the present
 situation in Spain.   Luns warned that unless the alli-
 ance was more than a technical defense agency, public
 support would decline.

 The smaller NATO members always have jealously
 guarded their right to play a full role in NATO and have
 strongly objected to any attempts by their larger part-
 ners to establish distinct and exclusionary relation-
 ships.   In large part, this is because Alliance member-
 ship provides the smaller states with more than physical
 security from aggression.                                    25X1
 Membership also gives them a sense of psychological
 security, an opportunity to make their views known, and
 a chance to play a larger role in world affairs.   The
 Guadeloupe summit has revived and heightened their fears
 that the Alliance might become a two-tier system in
 which their influence would be diminished at a time
 when issues that directly affect them are coming to the
 fore.                                                     25X1
 The divisions within NATO between the large and
 the small members could have an impact within the Euro-
 pean Community.   In the weeks ahead,  the European par-
 ticipants at Guadeloupe will find it necessary to con-
 vince the other members of the EC that they have taken
 account of their partners'  interests as well as their
 own.                                                       25X1
 Canada places special importance on the NATO con-
 sultative process,  and the Canadian representative took
 the lead at the NATO meeting last week in criticizing
 the NATO "big four."   He explained that because Canada
 is not a member of the EC,  "NATO is the sole forum open
 to Canada for this type of consultation."                  25X1
 The Canadians fear that the decline of the NATO
 consultative process could leave them isolated within
 the Alliance.   There may also be domestic reasons for
 the strong Canadian stand.   The Canadian press inter-
 preted the timing of the announcement of the Guadeloupe
 meeting--on the eve of Prime Minister Trudeau's visit
 to Paris--as a snub by France.

 Although the Italians were relatively quiet at last
 week's NATO discussions,  Italy is more sensitive to ques-
 tions of "presence" and "consultation" than other members
 of the Alliance.   As the largest of the small powers,
 moreover,  Italy expects to be included in the councils
 of the larger powers.   Its exclusion from Guadeloupe,
 coming just as the government was seeking to develop
 public support for joining the European Monetary System,
 is likely to figure in any future domestic disputes over
 EC and NATO issues.                                               25X1
 The decision to give the nonparticipants a second,
 more detailed briefing on Guadeloupe smoothed some of
 the ruffled feathers, but the smaller allies will be
 particularly vigilant in future instances in which they
 believe they are being ignored.   Some concede that there
 are times when the four major NATO members need to meet
 alone, but they all insist that the smaller countries
 must be kept fully informed about what occurs.   This is
 particularly the case where the interests of all NATO
 members are involved, as they were in many of the issues
 talked about at Guadeloupe and as they were in the dis-
 cussions of aid to Turkey.
 Current procedures for consulting with NATO--on the
 SALT negotiations,  for example--will be strained as
 East-West negotiations on "Gray Area Systems"  (primarily
 theater nuclear forces)  approach.   The rotational proce-
 dures  in NATO's Nuclear Planning Group,  where such mea-
 sures are discussed,  could become a source of controversy
 as some members of the Alliance become concerned that
 crucial decisions will be made without them.

 Chinese dissidents report that authorities have
 ordered a crackdown--including imprisonment--on human
 rights groups and on unofficial contacts with foreigners.
 A Chinese source has also reported the arrest of at
 least one leader of the recent peasant march on the Chi-

 diplomat in Beijing  (Peking)  has speculated that the

 from gas to heavy fuel oil in the cities of Baku and

 fuel emergency in Soviet Georgia.   Until last October,
 the Soviets had been importing about 350 billion cubic
 feet of natural gas a year from Iran at a cost of $1
 million a day.                                             25X1
