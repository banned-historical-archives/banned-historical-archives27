 Far East
 V I ETNAM
 The re-emergence of a strong
 militant faction among Buddhist
 leaders in Saigon resulted in
 new attempts to organize demon-
 strations in the capital this
 week.   Moderate Buddhist Insti-
 tute chairman Tam Chau left Sai-
 gon for a coastal resort on 13
 June, after his appeals for
 moderation were apparently turned
 aside by ranking Institute monks.
 Demonstrations against the gov-
 ernment began just a few hours
 later, and the number of altars
 in the streets increased as soon
 as Buddhist leaders countermanded
 Tam Chau's appeal for their re-
 moval.   Students at Saigon Uni-
 versity, who have gained strength
 in the past month,  also held anti-
 government rallies.   Thus far,
 police have successfully broken
 up these efforts and are check-
 ing identification cards of the
 protesters for eligible draftees
 and persons wanted by the police.
 In  Hue,  the uneasy coexist-
 ence                        between   government forces
 and dissident elements was  fi-
 nally broken on 16 June, when the
 government began using force to
 end the Buddhists'  passive re-
 sistance campaign.                              Police field
 forces from Saigon and a battal-
 ion of airborne troops began
 clearing away Buddhist altars
 which had cluttered the streets
 for more than ten days,  and dis-
 persing Buddhist                            protesters with
 tear gas.
 National Police Director Loan,
 who has been a strong force behind
 government efforts to regain con-
 trol of I Corps,  arrived in Hue
 on 13 June to direct the operation.
 Further government action in Hue
 will probably follow the same pat-
 tern as in Da Nang,  including a
 blockade of pagodas in which
 "struggle force" leaders have re-
 portedly taken refuge.   Government
 force may soon be applied in Quang
 Tri,  where dissident influence
 has also been strong.
 The government in Saigon
 is planning several major events
 for 19 June,  its first anniver-
 sary,  including the promulgation
 of the September election law
 and the establishment of an 80-
 man military-civilian advisory
 council.   Premier Ky is apparently
 considering personnel changes
 In reviewing the draft of
 the September election law,  the
 enlarged military-civilian
 Directorate decided, among other
 things,  to strike out the provi-
 sion allowing the constituent
 assembly to assume a legislative
 function in addition to drafting
 a. constitution.                    25X1

 a major issue,  there was no imme-

 since both Tri Quang and the Bud-

 called for a boycott of the Sep-
 tember elections.   However,  the

 decision to justify their boycott
 and urge other groups to do like-

 Military Developments
 Allied forces this week con-
 tinued to press several major of-
 fensives near the Cambodian border
 in a determined campaign to delay
 or disrupt Communist plans for
 large-scale attacks during the
 summer monsoon season.
 In western Kontum Province,
 three US and three ARVN battal-
 ions,   supported by heavy tacti-
 cal air strikes,  B-52 bombing mis-
 sions,   and artillery bombardment,
 kept pressure on elements of the
 24th North Vietnamese Army Regi-
 ment in strong entrenched posi-
 tions near Dak To Special Forces
 camp. By week's end,  Operation
 HAWTHORNE had resulted in 538
 enemy troops killed,  as against
 friendly losses of 49 killed
 (39 US) 201 wounded   (172 US),
 and seven US missing.
 Farther south,  the allied
 campaign in the high plateau re-
 gion was reinforced and geographi-
 cally expanded by the commitment
 of brigade-strength elements of
 the US 1st Air Cavalry Division
 to Cambodian border surveillance
 Operation HOOKER in southern Kon-
 tum and northern Pleiku provinces.
 In southwestern Pleiku Province,
 three battalions of the US 25th
 Infantry Division participating
 in operation PAUL REVERE con-
 tinued to monitor Communist troop
 movements in the border area
 around Chu Pong Mountain and the
 Ia Drang Valley.
 In Binh Long Province,  65
 miles north of Saigon,  multibat-
 talion US/ARVN task force ele-
 ments conducting Operation EL
 PASO II continued to inflict
 heavy losses on large-scale Com-
 munist troop concentrations
 threatening the Loc Ninh Special
 Forces camp.   By 15 June,  nearly
 200 Viet Cong had been killed,
 in contrast to allied casualties
 of 70 killed  (48 US),  154 wounded
 (83 US),  and 16 ARVN missing.
 Viet Cong military activity
 during the week was highlighted
 by three battalion-sized attacks
 in the adjacent north-central
 coastal provinces of Quang Ngai,
 Binh Dinh,  and Quang Tin.   The
 assaults,  two of which were tar-
 geted against Vietnamese Regional
 Force companies and one against
 a USMC reconnaissance platoon,
 resulted in heavy government
 losses,  totaling 98 killed  (12
 US),  183 wounded  (15 US),  43 miss-
 ing                                                                        (3 US), and 119 weapons cap-
 'Lured.
 DRV Loses Another MIG
 The first air engagement
 since early May between US and
 North Vietnamese fighters occurred
 on 12 June some 45 miles north-
 east of Hanoi.   US fighters shot
 clown one MIG-17 with an air-to-
 air missile and may have damaged
 another with cannon fire.   No
 US fighters were lost or damaged.

 Friendship Association pledged
 renewed efforts to "improve the
 militant friendship" of the two
 countries.
 On 9 June, NCNA attacked a
 five-point World Peace Council
 proposal which closely paralleled
 Hanoi's own four-point proposal
 for a settlement of the Vietnam-
 ese war,  and insisted on immedi-

 Vietnam before any settlement
 could be considered.

 meanwhile, continued to strike

 SECRET    NOW
 INDONESIAN-MALAYSIAN TALKS CONTINUE
 Indonesia and Malaysia are
 continuing talks toward at least
 an informal end of confrontation,
 but Indonesia's domestic politi-
 cal situation is still impeding
 a settlement.
 In view of President Sukar-
 no's refusal to sign the agreement
 reached by Indonesian and Malay-
 sian representatives in Bangkok
 on 1 June, Indonesia's official
 position now is that the Bangkok
 talks resulted in a "settlement"
 which constitutes a basis for
 agreement and that details still
 need clarification and solution.
 It was for this purpose that a top
 Malaysian Foreign Office official
 arrived in Djakarta on 10 June
 to talk with Indonesian Army chief
 General Suharto.   No firm informa-
 tion is available on the substance
 of these conversations.  Presum-
 ably they developed favorably,
 however, since mass rallies in
 Djakarta--apparently government-
 inspired--have called for ratifi-
 cation of the Bangkok agreement.
 Internally,  the anti-Com-
 munist and anti-Sukarno politi-
 cal movement--virtually mono-
 lithic in the early months after
 1 October--continues to fragment.'
 This development is particularly
 evident in East Java, and pro-
 Sukarno elements,  who are strong
 in the area, are trying to take
 advantage of it. The situation
 is rendered more complex by the
 fact that military units in East
 Java, particularly in the city    25X1
 of Surabaya, are pro-Sukarno and
 appear to be assistin   the
 civilians.

 THE LEADERSHIP STRUGGLE IN PEKING
 Turmoil in the leadership
 continues, with signs that the
 forces behind the ouster of senior
 politburo member Peng Chen are
 not sure of their next moves.
 These forces are believed to be
 led by the party's hard-driving
 General Secretary Teng Hsiao-ping.
 Mao Tse-tung may still dominate
 the leadership, but he seems to
 have lost several key supporters
 and may be under pressure to dele-
 gate control over the party ma-
 chinery and  over  key domestic
 and foreign policy issues.
 Teng is probably abetted by
 Defense Minister Lin Piao, whose
 standing seems to have been en-
 hanced by recent developments.
 Premier Chou En-lai may also be
 going along.   Their posts in the
 army and government would make
 them useful allies.   The role of
 Liu Shao-chi,  Mao's party deputy
 since 1945, has been unclear since
 March.   Moves may be under way to
 retire him from his party role.
 So far Peng Chen has been
 the only prominent figure to
 have fallen, but the Liberation
 Army Journal charged on 6 June
 that t e~i re are still enemies
 "in very high positions" who are
 trying to conceal themselves.
 The journal also criticized lead-
 ers who are overly preoccupied
 with solving economic problems
 at home and combatting US imperial-
 ism abroad.   This could be a slap
 at men who have responsibility
 for both internal and external
 affairs, such as Liu Shao-chi and
 Chou En-lai.   Other evidence
 would point to Liu as the more
 llikely candidate.
 Liu continues to make rou-
 tine appearances in his cere-
 monial role as chief of state,
 but his party role has received
 little recent press attention.
 For several years the press had
 been building him up as an ideo-
 logical authority,  an effective
 leader, and a reliable inter-
 preter of Mao,  in an obvious at-
 tempt to groom him as Mao's suc-
 cessor.   This build-up,  always in
 a fairly low key, was a little
 heavier than usual last winter
 and spring, but dropped off af-
 ter Peng Chen's downfall in early
 April.
 When Mao surfaced in early
 May, Teng,  not Liu, was the
 senior party representative in
 attendance.   Another indication
 that Liu may be on the sidelines
 was his absence from Peking from
 22 March to about 20 April, a
 period of intense political in-
 fighting in the Chinese capital.
 For much of that period Liu was
 traveling abroad, but for about
 15 days he was in provincial towns
 such as Hotien,  Urumchi,  and Kun-
 ming for no apparent reason.
 The struggle is not com-
 pletely resolved.   This is evident

 These papers are closer now than
 they were several months ago when
 they were taking opposing lines
 on key issues.   Differences re-
 main,  however,  and these are im-
 portant since they signal fac-
 tional disputes in a Communist

 media.
 Last month the Liberation
 Army Journal went so far as to
 hang a label of "absurd" on views

 prestigious People's Daily. Last
 'week the army journal and the
 New China News Agency came out
 with wildly differing versions
 ,of the role played by various
 publications in the attacks which
 resulted in the fall of Peng.Chen.
 These differences are not
 only signs of disarray on the
 'top but they also sow confusion
 in the ranks.

 INCREASED SOVIET MEDITERRANEAN NAVAL OPERATIONS
 The Soviet Navy has been
 showing the flag with increasing
 frequency in the Mediterranean and
 during the past month has deployed
 a record number of ships to that
 area.   The naval presence serves
 as a symbolic counterpart to the
 US Sixth Fleet and in general
 strengthens the image of Soviet
 military power in the area.
 Soviet submarines and sur-
 face ships. have called at Egyp-
 tian, Algerian,  and Yugoslav ports
 during the past several months,
 and Soviet naval vessels are op-
 erating near Syrian waters for
 the first time since the Russians
 began maintaining a permanent
 naval presence in the Mediterranean
 two years ago.
 Although Soviet naval ships
 are calling at Mediterranean
 ports with increasing frequency,
 little reprovisioning is done dur-
 ing these calls.   The Soviets so
 far have been able to support
 their Mediterranean operations
 with naval auxiliaries and mer-
 chant tankers from their Black
 Sea Fleet.   Eventually,  however,
 their warships may refuel and re-
 provision at Mediterranean ports
 as their survey and research ships
 presently do.
 While there would be opera-
 tional advantages to the USSR in
 having formal base rights,  these
 are probably outweighed by counter-
 vailing political considerations.
 Moscow's perennial propaganda at-
 tacks against Western bases would,
 for one thing,  be blunted and the
 potential host country would lose
 its claim to nonalignment.F -

 COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL CIVIL AIR DEVELOPMENTS
 The Communist countries con-
 tinue to seek expansion of their
 international air routes.   Moscow
 is negotiating with Canada, West
 Germany,  and Japan, while the
 Eastern European countries are
 augmenting their service to the
 Middle East and Africa.   The re-
 cent Chinese Communist - French
 agreement establishes Western
 Europe's first air link with
 China.
 A Soviet-Canadian air agree-
 ment appears imminent.   Canada
 has reacted favorably to a Soviet
 request for onward rights to Cuba
 --rights long sought by Moscow to
 permit a safer and more economi-
 cal route to Havana.   In return,
 the USSR has offered Canada prof-
 itable onward rights from Moscow
 to the Middle East and Southeast
 Asia.   Soviet negotiations with
 Bonn, however, are foundering
 over Moscow's insistence on a
 stop at East Berlin en route to
 Frankfurt.   Although joint oper-
 ation of a Moscow-Tokyo route is
 still planned to begin this July,
 Soviet-Japanese disagreements
 persist over passenger fares,
 sharing of profits, and charter
 rates for the Soviet TU-114.
 Moscow has encountered some
 problems in expanding its routes
 in Africa.   Regular service to
 Kenya,  Uganda, and Tanzania--
 provisionally arranged last No-
 vember--has been blocked by
 Sudanese intransigence in grant-
 ing the Soviets the right to
 pick up passengers at Khartoum
 for Nairobi and Entebbe.   The
 Sudanese also have prevented
 regular Soviet service onward
 to Brazzaville by refusing to
 amend their air agreement to
 allow this.   The USSR, prohibited
 from landing at Ghana, apparently
 hopes to compensate by adding
 Nigeria,  the Ivory Coast, and
 Cameroon to its West African
 route.
 The Eastern European coun-
 tries have expanded their few
 flights to the less-developed
 countries.   East Germany has in-
 cluded a stop at Damascus on its
 Cyprus flight, and is exploring
 the possibility of service to
 Guinea and Mali.   Hungary in-
 augurated regular flights to
 Lebanon this month,  and Polish
 flights to Beirut are scheduled
 to begin in July.   Rumania also
 has  shown  an interest in serv-
 icing  Lebanon, possibly in con-
 nection with a future route to
 Turkey.
 Czechoslovakia terminated    25X1
 weekly service to Afghanistan in
 April because of operating losses.
 However,  it resumed weekly flights
 to Bamako via Da-kar--sus ended
 since early 1965
 Air France plans to begin
 its weekly service to Shanghai
 in mid-September.   Reciprocal
 Chinese flights to Paris via
 Pakistan,  two points in the Middle
 East, Cairo,  and Tirana, however,
 probably will not begin in the
 near future.

 WARSAW PACT MOVING TO STRENGTHEN ITS NORTHERN TIER
 An unusually high-level mil-
 itary meeting in East Berlin this
 week probably considered changes
 in the disposition,  use, and in-
 tegration of the northern tier
 military forces of the Warsaw
 Pact.   Virtually the entire top
 command of the Soviet armed forces
 was present with its counterparts
 from East Germany, Poland,and
 Czechoslovakia.
 The East German news service
 announced on 12 June that Walter
 Ulbricht had given a luncheon
 for these high-level military repre-
 sentatives at which questions of
 "mutual interest" were discussed.
 The four-power talks follow
 a meeting of all Warsaw Pact de-
 fense ministers in Moscow last
 month.   At the same time the mil-
 itary discussions were proceeding
 in East Berlin,  the pact foreign
 ministers were meeting in Moscow.
 This series of get-togethers is
 probably preparatory to a meeting
 of the Warsaw Pact's Political
 Consultative Committee (PCC)--com-
 posed of the Soviet bloc party
 first secretaries--reportedly to
 be held in early July.
 The USSR and its northern
 allies are probably seeking a
 means to strengthen the Pact or-
 ganizationally through much
 closer integration of their
 for ces .
 Arrangements which give the
 northern states greater confi-
 dence in the area's defenses
 might also permit the USSR even-
 tually to reduce its forces in
 East Germany.   The USSR may wish
 to be in a position to hold out   25X1
 this prospect to General de
 Gaulle during his forthcoming
 visit.

 NATO ALLIES NEGOTIATE WITH FRENCH
 There was general pessimism
 at the opening of negotiations
 this week between the Germans and
 French in Bonn,  and at the North
 Atlantic Council  (NAC)  in Paris
 over the future of French forces
 in Germany.   Chancellor Erhard
 said he had doubts about the pros-
 pect of reaching an agreement
 with De Gaulle.   The Dutch press
 quoted Foreign Minister Luns as
 seeing "little reason to be opti-
 mistic."   Negotiations on this is-
 sue probably will set the pattern
 for the future French relationship
 with NATO.
 The French announcement that
 they had already removed some of
 their air fo_'ce units,  and the
 strong likelihood that other units
 would follow,  added to the pes-
 simism.   Both President de Gaulle
 and Foreign Minister Couve do Mur-
 ville have told US officials that
 they intended to remove the French
 air force from Germany so its re-
 action would not have to be auto-
 matic in the event of hostilities.
 However,  lower  level  French of-
 ficials have indicated there may
 be some room for negotiating a
 role for at least some of these
 forces so they may remain.
 French Government press re-
 leases,  however,  left the French
 position unclear. An official
 spokesman said that a squadron
 of fifteen jet fighters had been
 removed but emphasized that this
 did not mean that other units
 would follow.   Paris has made
 clear that it will insist that
 any command relationship of
 French forces to NATO must be
 held to the minimum and must
 not sacrifice French control
 over their wartime mission.
 The Germans,  meanwhile,
 have assured their allies that
 they will insist that their
 bilateral negotiations with the
 French on the status of French
 forces in Germany must parallel
 those taking place in NAC on
 the relationship of these forces
 to the NATO command.   Bonn plans
 to arrange an interim agreement
 to cover all French forces in
 Germany after 1 July until final
 arrangements are worked out.
 Last week,  at the NATO
 foreign ministers meeting in
 Brussels,  it was decided that
 the North Atlantic Council
 would be the organ for the
 negotiations between France and
 the Fourteen.   Although the
 French attitude at Brussels con-
 tributed to this week's pessi-
 mism,  it may also have produced,
 at least temporarily,  a greater
 unity among the Fourteen.   Both
 German Foreign Minister Schroeder
 and State Secretary Carstens
 remarked that the solidarity
 shown by the Fourteen was
 heartening and had exceeded ex-
 pectations.

 ELDO GETS REPRIEVE WITH NEW COST-SHARING FORMULA
 The European Launcher De-
 velopment Organization  (ELDO)
 ministerial council, meeting in
 Paris last week,  came up with a
 revised schedule for sharing
 costs which may dissuade the
 British from withdrawing.   The
 new formula,  which will be taken
 up at another meeting in July,
 would reduce Britain's share from
 about 39 to 27 percent.   West
 Germany's share would increase by
 4 and France's by 2 percent. The
 ELDO members reportedly decided
 to try to spend in each country
 between 80 and 100 percent of
 that country's contribution and
 to seek more effective cost con-
 trols.   Mounting costs have been
 a principal cause of Britain's
 reluctance to continue in ELDO.
 London's implied threat to
 withdraw provoked unanimously
 negative reactions  which, ac-
 cording to one British official,
 were "quite unanticipated." Con-
 tinental criticism fastened not
 only on the damage to an inde-
 pendent European space effort but
 also on the credibility of the
 UK's claimed desire for a larger
 role in Europe.   Secretary of
 State Rusk's expression of con-
 cern to Foreign Secretary Stewart
 that collapse of ELDO would make
 more difficult the problem of
 overcoming the growing technolog-
 ical gap between Europe and the
 US was also reported to have im-
 pressed the British.
 A British decision to re-
 main in ELDO would mean not only
 a reprieve for the organization
 but also would commit ELDO to
 developing its present launch
 vehicle into a more advanced
 version,   capable of placing a
 communications satellite into
 orbit.    French space officials
 have indicated that differences
 with the US may eventually emerge
 on how a European satellite is
 to fit with plans for a "world-
 wide system" under the terms of
 the International Telecommunica-
 tions Satellite Consortium agree-
 ment.
 The new ELDO cost-sharing
 proposals are apparently contin-
 gent on British participation in
 the development of ELDO's more
 advanced launcher and would not
 take effect until 1 January 1967.
 In earlier discussion of cost
 redistribution,  the British re-
 portedly suggested making such
 revisions retroactive, and there
 may be some bargaining ahead on
 this score.    Moreover,  the
 French are demanding that agree-
 ment on using French Guiana
 rather than an Australian loca-
 tion near Port Darwin for an
 "equatorial" launching site be
 part of a package deal to save
 ELDO.

 COMMUNIST TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH SINGAPORE
 The USSR, Bulgaria,  and Po-
 land have recently signed trade
 agreements with Singapore--the
 first bloc states to do so since
 the state declared its independ-
 ence from Malaysia in November
 1965.  Czechoslovakia, Hungary,
 and Rumania appear interested in
 reaching agreements in the near
 future.   The Communist nations'
 desire to develop economic ties
 coincides with Singapore's be-
 lief that it must maintain ex-
 tensive international economic
 ties to strengthen its position
 as an independent nation.
 The Soviet, Bulgarian,  and
 Polish pacts provide for up to
 US $15 million in trade the
 first year, exclusive of Commu-
 nist rubber purchases.  Before
 these agreements, Communist
 trade with Singapore consisted
 largely of imports of Malayan
 rubber.
 The pacts call for the Com-
 munist countries to ship heavy
 industrial and consumer goods to
 Singapore in exchange for raw
 materials and light industrial
 products.   The trade agreements
 will allow the Communist coun-
 tries to extend economic and
 technical assistance in estab-
 lishing unspecified joint indus-
 trial ventures in Singapore. The
 agreements also provide for an
 exchange of resident trade mis-
 sions with diplomatic immunity
 for each mission's representa-
 tive and deputy.   In addition,
 the Soviet and Bulgarian agree-
 ments stipulate that each mis-
 sion may use ciphered communica-
 tions.
 Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and
 Rumania expressed interest in
 economic ties when Singapore's
 Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew
 visited them during his recent
 tour of Eastern Europe.   In ad-
 dition to trade, Czechoslovakia
 tentatively proposed to extend
 the route of the Czechoslovak
 state airline into Singapore.
 Hungary proposed to establish a
 bank as well as joint governmen-
 tal economic ventures.  Rumania
 intends to examine the possi-
 bility of building an oil refin-
 ery.   The three countries will
 send trade delegations to Singa-
 pore in the near future, and
 hope to set up permanent trade
 missions there by the end of
 1966.

 Middle East - Africa
 IMPACT ON INDIA'S CURRENCY DEVALUATION
 New Delhi's recent devalua-
 tion of its currency by 36.5 per-
 cent has raised a domestic po-
 litical storm.                 Many politicians
 and businessmen argue that the
 adjustment cannot significantly
 improve the country's weak for-
 eign exchange position but will
 result in dangerous inflation.
 Leftists add that it represents
 an unnecessary sell-out to the
 US, the World Bank, and the West
 in general.
 Congress Party President
 Kamaraj is potentially the most
 influential I dissenter.   He appar-
 ently fears that the measure will
 injure the party's prospects in
 general elections next February.
 His views probably also reflect
 the dismay of,businessmen in his
 home state of Madras, his prin-
 cipal source of campaign funds.
 A number of lesser party offi-
 cials have followed Kamaraj's
 lead in quietly disassociating
 themselves from the devaluation
 decision.   This may cause some
 strain in the otherwise smooth
 working relationships between him
 and Prime Minister Gandhi.
 She and other government
 spokesmen are defending the move
 as essential to restore the badly
 crippled Indian economy.   The de-
 valuation was part of a series
 of reforms recommended by the
 World Bank, which chairs the con-
 sortium of Western aid donor coun-
 tries now considering their con-
 tributions to India's fourth Five
 Year Plan (April 1966-March 1971).
 If the donors follow through with
 enough hard currency aid to en-
 sure success of New Delhi's
 planned import liberalization
 program, criticism will probably
 slacken.
 Despite massive amounts of
 foreign aid over more than a
 decade, at the end of last year
 India held only about $600 mil-
 lion in gold and foreign exchange
 --an amount insufficient to fi-
 nance three months of commercial
 imports.   Efforts to boost ex-
 ports have fallen far short of
 plans, and the consequent decline
 in hard currency reserves
 prompted the government to im-
 pose increasingly stringent
 trade controls. Industrial pro-
 duuction for want of imported raw
 materials and spares for machin-
 ery slumped to about 50 percent
 of capacity.
 The foreign exchange short-
 age is not likely to ease imme-
 diately, although devaluation
 may eventually stimulate domes-
 tic production of some consumer
 goods now imported and will en-
 courage exports of manufactured
 items.. Export earnings probably can-
 not be greatly expanded because of
 the relatively inelastic world
 demand for India's leading ex-
 ports.   Imports are likely to in-
 crease as regulatory duties and
 import restraining schemes are
 withdrawn.      The major short-
 run gain connected with the de-
 valuation will be the accompany-
 ing relaxing of some of the        25X1
 tariffs and administrative con-
 trols that have hobbled indus-
 tries dependent on imports

 SIGNS OF EGYPTIAN-SYRIAN RAPPROCHEMENT
 The announcement on 8 June
 of a trade and payments agreement
 between Syria and Egypt may sig-
 nal the beginning of a rapproche-
 ment.   This limited measure is
 the first bilateral agreement
 since Syria's secession from the
 United Arab Republic in 1961
 touched off a period of intense
 rivalry.
 Nasir's willingness to seek
 a rapprochement with Syria's
 ruling Baathists--whom he regards
 as anathema--apparently is a re-
 sult of his deteriorating posi-
 tion in the Arab world.   His con-
 tinued involvement in Yemen,
 coupled with mounting domestic
 economic problems and dissatis-
 faction at home, have made him
 unusually sensitive to moves by
 Saudi King Faysal for Islamic
 solidarity.   Three months ago
 Nasir called for a coalescing of
 Arab nations with "unity of aims"
 which could rival what he ap-
 parently views as a Western-
 backed alliance of conservative
 Islamic states.
 The radical Baathist regime
 in Damascus also now is seeking
 to develop closer ties with
 "progressive" Arab forces. Until
 recently isolated from other
 Arab states,  the regime is un-
 sure of its own power position.
 The Syrian foreign minister re-
 cently visited Algiers.
 Moscow has publicly en-
 couraged a reconciliation ap-
 parently hoping to strengthen
 its own   osition in the Arab
 world.

 SE CRE T
 PROGRESS OF WEST AFRICAN ENTENTE
 West Africa's Council of the
 Entente appears to have made sig-
 nificant progress in a meeting held
 in Abidjan from 7 to 9 June. How-
 ever,  serious tensions revolving
 around the key role of relatively
 wealthy Ivory Coast are beginning
 to appear both in Abidjan and in
 some of the other capitals of mem-
 ber nations.
 The presidents of Ivory Coast,
 Niger,  Upper Volta, and Dahomey, and
 the foreign minister of Togo at-
 tended the meeting,which approved
 Togo's application for full member-
 ship   and reorganized the channels
 through which Ivory Coast subsi-
 dizes the other members.   The new
 arrangement creates a Mutual Aid
 and Loan Guarantee Fund to cover
 foreign loans for industrial, ag-
 ricultural, and commercial projects
 or for construction of transporta-
 tion and communication facilities.
 Unlike its predecessor,  the Entente
 Solidarity Fund,  the new fund re-
 quires all five members to make an
 annual contribution;  Ivory Coast
 will still provide the largest
 share by far.   The fairly rigid
 new conditions laid down for users
 of the guarantee funds are also
 bound to prove disappointing to
 some members, particularly Dahomey,
 whose economy is the most seriously
 and chronically out of balance.
 Ivory Coast President Hou-
 phouet-Boigny is coming under in-
 creasingly open criticism from
 ranking members of his own regime,
 principally because of his dealings
 with other African states   and the
 favoritism he shows to the other
 members of the Entente.   In the
 aftermath of a series of West
 African coups which touched Da-
 homey and Upper Volta early this
 year, he made major concessions at
 home on several unpopular issues,
 and this precedent could lead to
 still bolder efforts by dissidents
 to reduce Ivorian involvement in
 African affairs in favor of more
 internal development.   Houphouet
 also has reportedly been uncertain
 about whether he should attend the
 meeting in Tananarive late this
 month of the 14-member African-Mal-
 agasy Common Organization which he
 originally organized.
 Ivory Coast's external activi-
 ties have also become an active po-
 litical issue in Upper Volta.   An
 important faction there,  spearheaded
 by labor leaders,  charges that Hou-
 phouet has not really accepted their
 January revolution and is insulting
 Upper Volta by continuing to show a
 preference for imprisoned former
 president Yameogo and by slighting
 President Lamizana.   The popular en-
 thusiasm they have aroused may en-
 courage this group to push quickly
 for greater power in Ouagadougou.

 STUDENT RIOTS I N PANAMA
 Communist-led student dem-
 onstrations and rioting,  sparked
 by the unexplained death of an
 extreme leftist student on 1
 June,  were brought to a halt last
 week by the national guard's ef-
 fective riot-control tactics.
 The violence and destruction at-
 tending the disorders--the worst
 suffered by the Robles adminis-
 tration--have again emphasized
 the country's social and economic
 ills,  and the tendency for minor
 incidents to explode into seri-
 ous crises.
 Mobs of students and hood-
 lums attacked government build-
 ings and personnel in Colon on 6
 June,  leaving three dead, many
 wounded.  and damage estimated in
 the millions of dollars.   Con-
 tinuing disorders in Colon were
 paralleled by sporadic clashes
 between students and security
 forces in the capital and the in-
 terior.   Effective hit-and-run
 tactics used by small bands of
 demonstrators at times taxed the
 national guard's capacity to con-
 trol the violence.
 President Robles moved
 quickly to cordon off the Uni-
 versity of Panama--nucleus of
 Communist-directed student agita-
 tion--and the government clamped
 down on news media which had
 been encouraging an atmosphere
 of tension.   In addition,  orders
 were issued to arrest leading
 Communist agitators,  including
 radical pro-Castroite Thelma
 King.   In a speech to the nation
 on 7 June,  Robles implied that
 the outbreaks resulted from ef-
 forts of Communist subversives
 and from directives of the Tri-
 Continent Congress in Havana
 last January.   At  least five of
 the leading instigators of the
 riots have been trained in Cuba;
 two of them attended the Havana
 conclave.
 Arnulfo Arias,  the oppor-
 tunistic leader of the national-
 istic Panamenista Party,  Panama's
 largest,  refrained from open
 support of the students.
 Lacking widespread public
 support   in the current disturb-
 ances,  leftist student leaders
 were unable to provoke a general
 strike.   Nevertheless,  extrem-
 ists can be expected to continue
 capitalizing on the frustrations
 of Panama's overcrowded urban
 slum-dwellers and on the dis-
 content of the militant student
 population.    Simmering resent-
 ment against the Robles govern-
 ment could easily be turned into
 further rioting at any time.

 BOSCH CONCEDES DOMINICAN ELECTION
 Juan Bosch has finally con-
 ceded that his Dominican Revolu-
 tionary Party lost the 1 June
 elections.  In a radiobroadcast
 on 13 June, he said that even
 though fraud and coercion had
 cost him the victory, he intends
 to create a "democratic and hon-
 est" opposition to the Balaguer
 government.   He ruled out any
 form of coalition government,
 which had been rumored following
 his talk on 6 June with Balaguer.
 Bosch indicated that his
 party will, from its minority
 position in the Congress, press
 the administration to adopt more
 liberal programs, and will, at
 the same time, guard public liber-
 ties.   He contrasted his inten-
 tions to the conditions his gov-
 ernment'faced in 1963 when
 "groups of conspirators wanted
 to take over the government."
 becoming clear, however, that
 Balaguer will not delegate much
 of his decision-making power.
 Inconclusive talks between sec-
 ondary Reformist Party leaders
 and US Embassy officials indicate
 that even Balaguer's closest sup-
 porters are unable to speak with
 authority.
 By all indications, Balaguer
 intends personally to hold the
 reins of power in his regime and
 give the country a strong govern-
 ment.   Balaguer's chief criticism
 o:f the provisional government has
 been what he described as its
 failure to provide leadership and
 he has repeatedly stated that the
 principle of authority will be
 established in his administration.
 President-elect Balaguer has
 given little indication of how he
 intends to fulfill his many cam-
 paign promises, who will be in
 his cabinet, or who will head the
 military establishment.   It is
 political elements.
 During a press interview on
 1=L June, he restated his intention
 to make use of all capable Domin-
 icans regardless of political
 ideology.  He has vowed, however,
 not to put together a government   25X1
 by parceling out responsibility
 in an effort to balance diverse

 ECONOMIC PROBLEMS IN ECUADOR
 Ecuador's financial and eco-
 nomic situation is becoming in-
 creasingly grave.                 As of mid-May,
 foreign exchange reserves stood
 at about $18 million, down $15
 million from the first of the
 year.   In the first quarter of
 1966, reserves fell 26 percent--
 more than twice the loss during
 all of 1965.
 Minister of Finance Guillermo
 Borja Enriquez reportedly told
 a cabinet meeting on 31 May that
 unless the government received
 foreign assistance soon, it
 would be bankrupt.   Negotiations
 are under way with international
 financial agencies and the US
 Government for about $30 million
 in financial assistance.

 ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT MOVES TO SATISFY MILITARY
 The Illia government has
 decided to intervene in strike-
 torn Tucuman Province and to
 take other measures intended to
 satisfy the military that the
 administration can find solu-
 tions to some of Argentina's
 more pressing problems.   The
 military have adopted a wait-
 and-see attitude
 This decision was made on
 14 June after two emergency
 cabinet meetings which apparently
 were called because of growing
 military dissatisfaction with
 government policies.
 The intervention in Tucu-
 man is a significant shift in
 policy for President Illia. He
 has sought to avoid this step
 because he opposes it in princi-
 ple and because it removes a
 governor who is a member of his
 own People's Radical Party.
