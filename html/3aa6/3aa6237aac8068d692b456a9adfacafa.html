 Communism has only recently become an important factor in Burmese
 politics.  For a short period after the end of the war Communists dominated
 the most influential political organization in Burma.  They were out-
 maneuvered, however, by non-communist elements, split into two factions and
 eliminated from the government.  Nevertheless, the relatively few Communists
 have retained considerable popular support and, because of the widespread
 acceptance of Marxist theory in contemporary Burmese politics, have been able
 to exert an influence far out of proportion to thoir actual numbers.
 Both Communist Parties are now in armed rebellion against the Burmese
 Government.  The Burma Communist Party (BCP), the larger and more influential,
 has shown increasing oonforinity to the LIoscow line, and has obviously been
 strongly influenced by Chinese Communist policies.  Coniinist elements have
 contributed heavily to the prevailing political and economic Instability in
 Burma.  They have taken advantage of the instability to extend their influence
 and to seek new allies in order to develop a popular front through Which to
 achieve their ultimate objective--undisputed political control of Burma.  The
 BCP is known to have maintained extensive liaison with the Communist Party of
 India, and is suspected of being in contact frith Chinese and Indochinese
 Communists.  No direct contact with the Soviets, except ata few international
 gatherings, is known.

 Burmese Uovernment counritermeasures against the Communists }lave not
 yet been successful.  Although the Government possesses superior manpower
 and material resources, it is not likely to suppress effectively the Communist
 insurrection in the near future and prolonged guerrilla warfare is likely.
 On the other hand, the Communists appear to be incapable of overthrowing, the
 Government in the immediate future without considerable outside assistance.
 The utilization of Yestern assistance by the Burne se government, which might
 give it the necessary strength to establish itself as the genuine advocate of
 nationalism and improved conditions in Burma and at the same time identify the
 Communists as proponents of violence acting under foreign instruction, is a
 complex and delicate problem.  Moreover, the speed at which adverse events are
 taking place in China leaves little time in Burma for developments favorable
 to the *~West.

 COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN BURMA
 Introduction
 Communism is a relatively recent phenomenon in Burma?  Although a
 small group of Burmese, mostly university students, were inspired by
 communist literature and participated in sporadic communistic activities
 during the mid-thirties, there was no formally organized Communist Party
 until 1914.  The development of a cohesive  Communist movement began to
 evolve in 19112 when all Communist-inclined Burmese united in common
 opposition to the Japanese and advocated uqualified support of the Allies.
 Because they were instrumental in organizing and directing the Burmese
 resistance to the Japanese, the Communists emerged from the war with their
 prestige and popularity tremendously enhanced,
 In August 1914., the Communists were primarily responsible for the
 amalgamation of various elements of the resistance into the Anti Fascist
 Peoples' Freedom League (AFPFL), the only effective political force in
 Burma at the war's end.  Communists-held key positions in the .AFPFL and
 the Burma Communist Party (BCP) constituted its largest and best organized
 component.  The Communists undertook a strenuous effort to gain complete
 control of the AFPFL and to this end conducted an intense campaign to
 strengthen the party and broaden its popular base.  Until early 1946,
 the BCP was able to dominate the AFPFL, but it never achieved complete
 control.  Gradually, its drive for power aroused anti-Communist sentiment
 within the AFPFL and led to the formation of a non-Communist coalition
 which, with considerable adroitness, split the BCP and forced the with

 drawal from the League of both factions.  The two Communist groups there-
 upon became the first effectively organized opposition to the AFPFL.           The
 Communist Party (Burma), (CPB), popularly called. Red Flags, was organized
 in March 19116 and commenced a campaign of violence almost from the date
 of its birth.  The Burma Comunist Party (BCP) faction, which retained the
 title, is the more important and influential of the two Communist parties
 despite a sizeable loss of membership.  Although the BCP also instigated
 unrest after its expulsion from the AFPFL in November 19146, it temporarily
 avoided overt violence.  Rather., the BCP sought a rapprochement with the
 AFPFL and might have succeeded had it not insisted upon the unconditional
 acceptance of its terms.
 In February 19189 acting on orders believed to have originated with
 the Soviet Ambassador in New Delhi and transmitted by the Communist Party
 of India.. the BCP radically altered its policies and embarked upon a
 program of extreme agitation directed against the AFM and the Government
 it sponsored,  The Commmmist press immediately commenced a campaign of
 abuse and vilification, BCP leaders openly advocated overthrowing the
 Government, a series of strikes developed, and there were strong indicate
 tions that the BCP planned to establish parallel administrations in the
 areas of central Burma which it dominated.  On 28 March, the Government
 finally took action by forseably breaking the strikes and arresting as many
 Communists as possible.  However,, all important BCP leaders escaped and a
 full-fledged Communist insurrection soon commenced under their direction,
 Sources of Communist Strength
 The causes underlying the birth and growth of Communism in Burma
 not difficult to ascertains   More than a hundred years of foreign rule

 created a number of circur tances highly favorable to Communist exploita-
 tion.  Chief among these was the natural, and nearly universal Burmese
 resentment of foreign domination,  Furthermore, while the British colonial
 administration was, in many respects, highly enlightened and beneficial
 to Bum., it was far from a blessing-*  Under a policy of laissez faire
 and the impersonal rule of law the old Burmese social order collapsed and
 xaa not adequately replaced by Western institutions.  Agrarian indebted-
 ness, dispossession and general economic distress became widespread, and
 control of the country's entire economic life passed increasingly into
 foreign handso  Another unfortin me aspect of British rules was a milita
 policy of excluding Burmans from the armed forces while recruiting among
 the Karen, Chin and Kachin minorities who, along with imported Indian
 troopz, were used to maintain ordero  in all., the general disorganization
 of Burmese society, economic hardship and the inability of Burmese to
 participate in the development and defense of their country led to the
 development of a spirit of intense nationalism and to a wide acceptance
 of Marxism, including the Stalinist varietyo
 Communism in Burma made considerable popular headway during and
 after the last warn  The Communists' initiative in organizing the
 resistance movement and the AFPFL permitted them to capitalize upon the
 popularity of Communist resistance* leaders and to identify Communism
 with natiornallsmn  In tend of finances, organi ation and a defined party
 program, the Communists heLd and utilized a tremendous advantage over
 other political groups,  M1ra awhile, the serious dislocations caused by
 three and a half years 'of war served to enhance the appeal of easy'
 Communist promises and simple solutions of Burmese grievances o  Jln  addition,

 the Communists have been able to utilize the extremely individualistic
 Burman native, the general distrust of and resistance to Governmental
 authority and endemic lawlessness for their own purposes.  They have also
 been able to exploit the admiration of many young Burmese for Soviet
 economic and military accomplishments.  The Communists have struck respon-
 sive chords by criticizing the numerous glaring weaknesses and shortcomings
 of the AFPFL and the Burmese Government and have profited by some of the
 Government's anti-Communist measures which have injured the innocent as
 well as the guilty.  Finally, the Larch 1948 rebellion led by a large part.
 of the Communist-inclined Peoples' Volunteer Organization (PVO), one of
 the two major components of the AFPFL after the Communists had been
 expelled, and the January 1949 revolt of the Karens, the largest ethnic
 minority group in Burma, have provided the Communists with new opportunities
 to extend their influence.  Not only do these disaffections further
 contribute to instability in Burma., but they pave the gray for the Communists,
 who were once fairly well isolated, to seek new allies to augment their
 own efforts for the overthrow of the existing regime.
 THE HIRMk COIF! JNIST PARTY
 Organization
 The organization of the BCP appears to be similar to that of other
 Communist parties throughout the world.  The familiar system of "demo-
 cratic centralization" of power has been adopted,  Supreme authority is
 vested in a three-man Politburo theoretically elected and responsible to
 a Central Committee, which, in turn, is accountable to periodic Party
 Conferences.  The last conference was held in Feburary 1948 for the pure

 pose of endorsing the Politburo's decision to implement the new revolutionary
 policy emanating from Indian  Below the national leve3., the Communists
 established upper and lower Burma commands- over organizations supervised
 by District Secretary Generals and Central Committees.  There is evidence
 that the Communist organization is further subdivided into township and
 village tract groups and that a separate unit, perhaps ranking with the
 district level, is maintained in Rangoon and possibly Mandalay.  The smallest
 and basic unit is, of course, the cell.
 Considerably less clear is the functional division within the BCP.
 There is a propaganda section whose activity has been curtailed and a
 women's section, known as the Wom?s' Congress.  In addition, there is
 undoubtedly an organizational section charged with the recruitment of new
 party members, the promotion of front organizations, and the infiltration
 and exploitation of other groups and associations0  Finally, there appears
 to be a military section the structure of -which closely parallels BCP
 political frame work.  In many cases the two ars indistinguishable.  The
 Politburo dictates military as well as political policy although imple-
 mentation is unquestionably largely conducted by local commanders.
 The reported "supreme commander" of all Communist military forces is a
 member of the Central Committee to whom all District and Township Military
 Committees,, which almost certainly also exercise. political control in
 their respective areas, are responsible.
 BOP organization has undoubtedly been adversely affected by the
 necessity of operating underground.  The effectiveness of its chain of
 command undoubtedly varies from area to area and from group to group.

 It is probably also hampered by personal rivalries and the independent
 tendencies of local leaders.  Nevertheless, the BCP continues to function
 with a reasonable degree of efficiency and continues capable of  maintain-
 ing pressure on the government and of expanding its activities whenever
 an opportunity is presentedo
 Leadership
 The undisputed leader of the BCP is its Secretary Generals, Thakin
 Than Tun*  Than Tun emerged as a Communist leader in the thirties, rose
 to prominence in the resistance movement and was Secretary General of the
 AFPFL until the Communists were expelled.,  Of apt]. the Burmese Communists,
 Than Tun probably best understands Communist ideology and its applicability
 to Burman  While appearing to lack certain qualities of leadership, Than
 Tun has demonstrated a considerable capacity for organization and
 administration.  As far as can be determined, he has steadfastly conformed
 to orthodox party principles and directives and has given no indication
 of "nationalist deviation."  He appears to have the solid support of the
 Central Committee and, if recent publications in the Soviet press are any
 indication, his leadership has the sanction of the Kremlin and his party
 is recognized as the "official" Communist Party in Burman
 The only other BCP leader to attain substantial international
 prominence is H. N. Goshal, a Burma-born Indiano  Goshal is vaell-indoctri?
 sated and has had extensive experience as a Communist agitator in both
 the Indian and Burmese labor movements.  After the war he became a member
 of the BCP's Politburoo  He has served the party by proselytizing Indian
 laborers and cultivators, and by effecting liaison with the Communist

 Party of Indian  It was Goshal who, while in India, ostensibly wrote
 and then delivered the document upon which the BCP based its revolutionary
 program.  In late 1948, Goshal was reported to have clashed with Than Tun
 by advocating the abandonment of violence.  Later, when severely censured
 by the Central Committee, he is supposed to have recanted.  However, as a
 result, he may have lost his position on the Politburo and suffered a loss
 of prestige and influence in the party.
 With a very few exceptions, other BCP functionaries are young
 men whose individual capabilities cannot be accurately assessed.  Unlike
 Than Tun, it is doubtful that many of these have more than a superficial
 understanding of Communism and all its ramifications, especially its
 inherent danger to sovereignty.  Although personal rivalries quite
 probably exist within the BCP, as evidenced by the occasional differences
 of opinion with which Than Tun has had to contend, they have not reached
 disruptive proportions.  On the contrary, the BCP leaders seem to work
 with reasonable consonance, have kept the Communist machine functioning
 with a relatively high degree of discipline and efficiency, and have given
 no indication of digressing from their present course in the foreseeable
 future.
 Stren  h
 The exact numerical strength of the BCP cannot be accurately
 estimated because the lines separating Communists, actual and intimidated
 sympathizers and lawless bands operating under the cloak of Communism,
 are very indistinct.  Rank and file party members are mostly opportunistic
 followers of local.leaders, those who bear a grievance against the govern-

 meet, or those who have succumbed to Communist propaganda which promise's
 improvement of their standard of living.  While several widely varying
 estimates of BCP strength have been attempted, none appears to have
 significant factual basis,  Judging from the limited information  available,
 actual membership of the BOP probably does not exceed a few thousand,
 The BCPas influence, however, is substantially greater than its numerical
 strength would indicate.  It commands a considerable popular following
 (perhaps several hundred thousand) throughout a large part of Burma,
 especially in those rural areas of central and southern Burma where it has
 exercised moze or less de facto control since the end of the war.
 Distribution of Influence
 Before the BCP commenced its insurrection, it maintained three
 major front groups designed to promote the cause of Communism among those
 elements considered most susceptible to Communist indoctrination, i.e0,
 peasants, laborers, and youths.  These organs were the All-Burma PeasantsO
 Union which claimed 29_%000 members, the All-Burma Trade Union Congreee a,
 an important component in Bur   s small trade union movement, and the
 Peoples' Democratic Youth League (Red Guards) claiming a membership of
 20,000 political enthusiasts,  While membership figures were quite
 probably an exaggeration, these organizations were unquestionably of
 considerable importance and counted adherents scattered over two-thirds
 of Burma.  Although they have since disintegrated, or at least gone
 underground, most of their members are presumed to retain strong pro-
 Communist sympathies and constitute the bulk of the Communists? present
 popular following,

 Approved For Release 2000/08/  `.           01082A000100030008-9
 The prevailing political atmosphere in Burma has provided
 Communists the opportunity to infiltrate and influence several prominent
 non-Communist organizations ? Among these are the A11-Burma Students'
 Unions the Rangoon University Students' Union,, the All--Burma Muslim
 League and the All-Burma Ministerial Services Union, all of whom when
 cor bind., form a very significant force in Burmese politics o  Further-
 more., the Communists have been able to take advantage of pro-Communist
 tendencies in the  PVO and to a lesser extent in military and police
 units where they have been able to pronote some unrest and desertions.
 Although genuine Communist publications have been suspended., their
 views still receive fairly wide dissemfna,tiono  The BCP somehow continues
 to produce handbills and pamphlets which are circulated rather freely,
 even in Rangoon.  In addition., some left-wing newspaper continue to carry
 party-line materials although refraining from severe criticism of the
 Government.   In November 1948, a number of ultra Leftist journalists
 formed a semi-political organization known as the New bra "biters
 Association dedicated to the advancement of "new democracy."  Its material.,
 published without Governmental interference, is hardly distinguishable
 from that of the Communists.  Finally., Communist literature, in both the
 English and Burmese languages,, can be purchased at a "Peoples Literature
 House" in Rangoon, which is known to have been financed and established
 by the Communist Party of India with the cooperation of Goshal4
 Since it went underground., the BCP appears to have made strenuous
 efforts to develop new front organizations  They have been reported as

 Democratic Army," and strongly influencing a "New Democratic Front" in
 Rangoon led by extremist elements of the All-Burma Ministerial Services
 Union and the A11-Burma Students Union?  In March 1949, BCP succeeded
 the "Peoples' Democratic Front" (PDF), in forming a coalition with an
 undetermined number of PVO's and army mutino-ears who heretofore had been
 conducting their own separate rebellions.  3Vhile the lasting qualities
 of this coalition have not been demonstrated  and there is evidence of
 growing friction between its component:, elements, it is potentially the
 most serious threat to the restoration of stability in Burma., especially
 if it falls completely under BCP control.  The PDF already dominates
 considerable territory and has a relatively large and well-armed military
 force at its disposal,  It would appear to offer the i3CP an ideal oppor.
 tunity to develop a broad "popular front" movement without which its is
 highly unlikely that the Communists could achieve domination of Burma,
 Geographically, the BCP controls several relatively small and
 scattered areas in the Irrawaddy and Sittang River valleys and throughout
 the Irrawaddy Delta area.  It seer unlikely, however, that the BCP
 could control as much territory as it does if it were the only group in
 rebellion against the Governments  The PDF and independent PVO groups
 control a solid bloc of territory along the Irrawaddy stretching from
 about 30 miles north of Rangoon to some 125 miles north of Mandalay as
 well as other substantial areas, including parts of Tenasserim in the
 south and the Shan and Machin States in the east and north.  Although all
 PDF and PVO?controlled territory should not be considered Communist-
 dominated., it is probable that they are susceptible to Communist penetration,

 Military Activities
 BCP military activities are conducted almost e;clusively by small
 guerrilla bands operating on a hit-and-rim basis in widely separated areas,
 These bands are well-supplied with an assortment of small calibre Japanese.,
 British and American small arms.,  While the Communists have been able to
 capture numerous poorly defended towns and villages., they have been unable
 to hold a given position against determined Government attack and have
 consciously avoided engaging is pitched battles wherever possible.  Although
 numerically and materially weaker than the Government forces, the Communists
 enjoy such advantages as favorable terrain., extreme maneuverability and
 capacity to fade into the local populace.  Furthermore,iey are opposed
 by forces both limited and inexperienced -which must cops with other
 insurgents and which are capable of giving adequate and continuLng pro-
 tection only to selected centers of population.                     Consequently  the BCP
 has not been suppressed., or is it likely to be in the predictable future,
 The ultimate objective of the BCPts military campaign is., of course.,
 to wrest political power from any oxisting non-bCcunist regime.  Hfowever9
 until such time as the BCP is able to develop a force capable of making
 successful frontal assault upon the Government,, it gust continue to
 resort to guerrilla tactics as the best means of underlining the Govern-
 ment's authority and aggravating national i.nstabi..lityo
 Military relations between the BCP and other insarrgent groups are
 obscure., largely because of the difficulty often encountered in identify-
 ing the participants in any given r ngagemento  Nevertheless, there are
 strong indications that on several occasions it has cooperated with

 Government and PVO forces against the Karenso  In other cases., however.,
 it is reported to have avoided fighting the Karens and to have moved
 into areas cleared, but later evacuated, by the Karens.  Despite Govern-
 ment allegations., there is very little evidence of premeditated cooperation
 between the BCP and the Karens.  Clashes between BCP forces and Red Flag
 Communists have been frequent and there is reason to believe that the
 mutual animosity of the two Communist  groups is bitter and deep-seated.
 Despite the formation of the PDP and Communist efforts to avoid antagonizing
 the PVO, there have been conflicts between the two and there are indica-
 tions of growing friction within the framework of the PDF over the matters
 of spheres of influence and local leadership.
 As long as the various rebel groups remain divided and mutually
 antagonistic, the Government m Tr be able to hold its on militarily for
 some time to comet  Nevertheless, Communist military activity contributes
 to the reduction of almost all Government revenues while at the same time
 forces steadily increased non-productive military expenditures and seriously
 hampers effective administration by creating widespread unrest.  As a
 result,, economic deterioration may be a greater threat to the Government
 than direct military action,
 Mans and Policies
 BCP policies, originally almost purely based on nationalism and
 identical to those of the AFPFL, have since become increasingly doctrin-
 aire.                       Nevertheless., the primary source of friction between the BCP and
 the Socialist-dominated AFPFL may be traced to AFPFL efforts to attain
 independence and implement a Marxist program without resorting to violence.,

 rather than to any fundamental differences regarding the acceptability of
 Communism.  As a result, the Anglo-Burmese Treaty, which includes impor-
 tant concessions to the UK in return for independence, has become the chief
 medium of BOP propaganda attacks upon the Burmese Government.  For
 obligating Burma to honor foreign debts,, to pay compensation for nationalized
 foreign property and to accept a British Military Mission, the BCP accuses
 the AFPFL's "right wing" of selling out to Anglo-American "capitalist-
 imperialists,," accepting sham independence, completely betraying their
 "revolutionary" principles and becoming "fascists "  In addition,, steadily
 deteriorating conditions in Burma have forced the Government to seek
 relief by modifying its extreme leftist policies and seeking closer re-
 lations with the West, thus providing the BCP with further "proof" of
 its "reactionary" tendeencies9
 The most recent expression of BCP policies appears in the manifesto
 announcing the formation of the PDF,, which, although signed by representa-
 tives of all participating elements, was undoubtedly written by the
 Communists.  It presents a comprehensive politico-economic program which
 generally conforms to the internal "party line" and in many respects is
 strikingly similar to the policies of the Chinese Communist Party.
 Clearly,, the first objective is the development of the PDF into an effeo-
 tive political and military organization under BCP leadership.  The entire
 organization is to be managed "democratically" by a nine-man Executive
 Committee, representing the three components equallyo  Popular support
 is to be developed by district,, township and village committees.  Member-
 ship,, however, is to be on individual basis; members cannot be anti-
 Communist and must faithfully adhere to all Executive directives.  The

 tion.  Furthermore, there are indications of growing suspicion of the
 Communists within the PD1' as well as the development of personal jealousies,
 'Nevertheless., the BCP has succeeded, temporarily at least, in forming a
 popular front dominated by Than Tun and may now make efforts gradually to
 amalgamate those fragments still operating indopendent.ly.  Moreover, it
 is in a better position to remove the possibility of an effective
 rapprochement between the Government and the PVO.  As a result, Com munist
 capabilities in Burma have beenr  reciably enhanced and., unless undermined
 by internal dissension., stand a good chance of becoming even more
 formidable,
 -Foreign Contacts
 The BCP is known to have been in contact with the Communist Party
 of India and probably still is,   Although the channels of communications
 are not known., liaison is probably maintained through Indian Communists
 resident in Burma and those arriving by land., air or sea routes.  On a
 few occasions., notably the 19Li$ Commonwealth Communist Conference in
 London and the conference sponsored by the W=orld Federation of Democratic
 Youth in Calcutta in 1918, BCP representatives had the opportunity to meet
 Communist groups from several other countries, including the USSR.
 Although there is no conclusive evidence of direct liaison between the
 BCP and Chinese Communists., extensive liaison, relatively safe from de-
 tection, could exist and there are indications that it does.  Such
 liaison is facilitated by the absence of adequate border security measures.
 The BCP's incorporation of significant portions of the Chinese program
 into its own has already been noted.  Moreover., the man who is reported

 to be the Secretary General of the Burma branch of the China Democratic
 League is suspected of being a contact man between Burmese and Chinese
 Communists.  He is said to have been on friendly terms with the president
 of the Peoples' Democratic Youth League and to have attended the Cal-
 cutta conference and, in the company of another Chinese, the BCP
 conference when it adopted the program of violence*
 There have also been a few cases in which Chinese have been
 arrested under suspicious circumstances and may have been involved in
 liaison activity.  Finally, the China News Agency has reported the
 signing, In Burma, of a mutual assistance agreement between the Chinese
 and Burmese Communist Parties.  Although such an event appears highly
 improbable, it is by no means impossible.
 No direct contacts with Soviets or the USSR have ever been proved,
 although recent unevaluated rumors emanating from Thailand charge the
 Soviet Legation there with purchasing arms and ammunition in the black
 market and smuggling them to the Burmese Communists.  However, until
 more positive evidence is available, it should be assumed that BCP
 relations with the USSR are tenuous and indirect.
 The extent of foreign control over the BCP is still an unresolved
 question.  Strong foreign influence is discernable In its propaganda and
 In its growing compliance to orthodox Communist doctrine and use of
 violence,. Although Than Tun has denied the charge of foreign control, he
 has publicly stated that "The peoples of the world's fight under the
 leadership of Soviet Russia is allied to the same struggle in Burma"
 and that there were many Indians and Chinese in the BCP some of -whom had

 "elected" leaders by the masses.  The BCP therefore has deonnonstrated
 its amenability to foreign"advice,"'at least on a policy level, and it
 would probably accept material assistance with alacrity.  However, it
 is entirely possible that the Connunist movement in Burma would be
 seriously retarded in the event of large-scale and overt foreign inter-
 vention in the implementation of policy

 CO "0I SST PARTY  BURMA}
 The CPB appears to have degenerated from a fairly formidable organi-
 zation into numerous uncoordinated anarchist and bandit gangs operating with-
 out principles or clearcut objectives.  This loss of cohesiveness may be
 largely due to the long incarceration of its leader, Thankin Soe, and may be
 reotif:.ed somewhat when, and if, he is freed from reported imprisonment by
 the PDF.  In terms of members, popular support and insurrectionary potential
 the CPB is considerably weaker than the BCP.  Although the CPB has been re-
 sponsible for some of the disturbances in central and southern Burma, it has
 been most active in the Arakan, which forms the western coastal area of Burma.
 However, even as regards the Arakan, it is questionable as to how much of the
 unrest can be attributed to the CPB, to nrakanese separatists, or to both.
 The CPB's policies, if any actually exist, are at best vague generalizations
 having much in common with all other Burman political parties.  Militarily,
 the CPB violently opposes the Government, the PVO and the BCP which latter is
 considered to be opportunistic and oompromising.  -.lthough the CPB advocates
 cooperating with the Karens, it appears to have had little, if any, success.
 So far as is known the CPB does not maintain any foreign contacts.  All things
 considered, the CPB is considered a dangerous organization capable of numerous
 activities and of prolonging the general unrest in Burma, but not of unseat-
 ing the Government.
 CHINESE CU:..:UITIST ACTIVITY
 Stimulated by postwar developments in China, intensified Communist
 activity among the estimated 250-300,000 Chinese in Burma, most of whom have
 close personal and sentimental ties with China, has made considerable headway.

 epreatd of Commuatl sm have become Increasingly weak and ineffeotual.  The main
 aefttere of Chinese Co o mmist activity appear to be Rangoon, Mandalay and along
 the Tuunau-Burma border.  In Rangoon, here the Chinese Co monists are said
 to umiutain their headquarters, there are several well-financed party organizers,
 some of whom recently returned to China presumably for instructions,  of the
 50,000 Chinese in Rangoon, there are estimated to be 3,000 party members or
 active supporters, and most of the remainder are suspected of being at least
 opportunistically or passively sympathetic to the Chtraese Corrmzn,ist movements

 all Chinese publications in Rangoon, with the exception of the one Kuouintaxg
 Mei, which has steadily lost circulation, have takers a pro-Com mist stand,
 at least insofar an China is concerned.  Limited information Indicates that
 Chinese Oo    st activity in Upper Burma is directed from ILandalay, but in
 view of the highly disturbed conditions that have recently obtained in that
 area this may no longer by tb  case.  Nevertheless, they are apparently still
 aotive, and making a particular ei''ort to recruit new adherents among the
 resident Chinese Nationalist deserters and refugeoe drifting down from Yunnan,
 Also, there have been several Chinese incursions along the Siuo?-Burmese border,

 The Chinese Cnmists, however, have tried to minimize their overt,
 activities, leaving such to its front organisation, the China Democratic
 League (CDL),  COAL publications are completely pro-Communist in orientation,
 and the CDL is suspected not only of being in con#-.aot with Burmese Com n1$ts,
 but also of operating a secret radio in Rangoon and facilitating the infiltration

 of Chinese Cora-unists into Burma.  Moreover, it reputedly maintains amicable
 relations with U Ba Swe, the extreme leftist chairman of the Burma Socialist
 Party (BSP), and may have been partly responsible for the recent Socialist
 manifesto which praised the Chinese Communist, denounced Anglo-American "im-
 perialism,," and claimed that the Socialists were the true adherents of Marxism
 in Burma.  A CDL newspaper also published a statement by Ba SQUe in which he
 reiterated admiration for the Chinese Communists and accused the :1nglo.Arericans
 of instigating the long-standing Sino-Burmese border problem and of attempting
 to make a Tito of Mao Tse-tung.
 From the evidence at hand, it is believed that Chinese Communist policy
 towards Burma is only in the earliest stages of development.  The primary ob-
 jective would seem to be the consolidation of the Chinese population in Burma
 under firm Communist control and later its use as an effective instrument of
 Chinese Communist foreign policy.  A second objective seems aimed at allaying
 Burmese fears of Chinese domination and the creation of sympathy for the Chinese
 movements  The third, and final objective, naturally, is Communist control of
 Burma, perhaps preferably under the aegis of China.  Such objectives may
 explain the Chinese Communists' avoidance of becoming involved in Burmese affairs
 and their concentration upon the resident Chineseo  At the same time, the
 Chinese Communists are free to deal with the Burmese Communists, while the
 "separate and distinct" CDL can approach other political elements, including
 those supporting the Government, without alienating potential supporters on
 either side.  In this latter respect, it is significant to note that of all the
 Govt.rnments of Southern Asia, the Burmese Government is the only one the Chinese
 Communists have not denounced.

 It therefore appears that the Chinese Communists are attempting to take
 advantage of the general leftist tendencies of the various Burmese factions
 and to curry favor wherever the opportunity presents itaelf in the hope of the
 emere,enee, perhaps under Chinese guidance, of a popular front in support of a
 Government favorably disposed towards a Communist Chimp  It is possible, how-
 ever, that they are seeking; to split the Socialist Party in order to weaken
 further the present Government to the advantage of the Burmese Commmunists.
 GOVERNMENT CUUNTERMEASURES
 The Burmese Government is simultaneously attempting to suppress Communism
 by force and to advance a social and political program designed to undermine
 the appeal of Communism.  These efforts, however, have been largely unsuccess-
 ful as the Government has been continually plagued by numerous seemingly
 insurmountable obstacles, some of which are of its own making.
 whsle CPB has been outlawed, the BCP has not,
 has been taken against Chinese Communists in Burma,
 possesses rather extensive leval powers which it has
 and no action whatever
 The Government, however,
 utilized against all real,
 or imabined, insurgents.  Under a Public Order Preservation Order, individuals
 may be arrested and held without trial indefinit8ly.        The Burmese President has
 the power (which is exercised only on the Government's advice) to declare martial
 law anywhere in the country.  The President also has the power, under a Consti-
 tutional Remedies Suspension Order, to suspend such constitutional provisions
 as those relating to habeas corpus, writ of mandamus, prohibition and  uo
 warrantoo.  Although the circumstances unquestionably call for stringent measures,
 the lack of uniformity and irresponsibility that has often marked their appli-
 cation have probably negated much of the salutary effect they otherwise might
 have hadd

 Militarily, the Government's armed forces are superior to those of the
 Communists in terms of manpower and materiel, but are, nevertheless, severely
 handicapped in a number of respects.  The most important Is the wide dispersion
 of these forces throughout the country to fight a variety of insurgents, in
 addition to the Commmists.  Government forces have to contend with difficult
 terrain and unorthodox military tactics without the benefits of efficient
 transportation and communication systems.  Almost all military supplies must
 be imported, and these are limited by a depicted Treasury.  Karen and PVO
 defections reduced Arn y and Military Police strength by at least 2C5, entailed
 a considerable loss of nateriel and generally lowered the efficiency and effective-
 ness    of Burma's military forces vrhile enhancing the capabilities of anti-
 Government forces.  Burmese military forces suffer from inexperience, and are
 woefully short of technical, organizetional and leadership personnel.  Other
 weaknesses are politics, nepotism, graft and corruption.  Many Burmans in the
 armed forces reta:n sympathies with the P''O'  and Communists which has rendered
 them unreliable in many instances.  In addition, the Government, inspired by
 the Socialists,  has raised an estiruted 22,000 police levies to supplement
 the regular military forces.  Although the levies have since been placed under
 army or military police administration, they are regarded by many observers
 as a private organ of the Socialist Party.  They are poorly trained and ill-
 disciplined, have not particularly distinguished themselves in the field, and
 their future effectiveness and loyalty is open to question.  Finally, high
 Burmese military authorities are extremely suspicious  of the British Military
 Mission, whose chief function is to rectify just such deficiencies, and have
 increasingly disregarded its advice and ignored its offers of assistance.  As

 a result, Burmese military forces have not been able to suppress the Communists,
 much less all the other insurgents, and are pressed to maintain control of
 the towns they garrison and the lines of communication between them.
 Politically, the Burmese Government has made several efforts, including
 the offer of a generous amnesty, to settle the Communist insurrection by
 negotiation.  the Communists, however, never gave indication of accepting.
 Basic government policies parallel those advocated by the Communists
 under a higher standard of living in most respects.  The government promises
 the Burmese people political freedom, economic security, and a socialized wel-
 fare state through the redistribution of land, industrialization, state control
 of the means of production and equitable distribution of surplus wealth. Such
 a program has undoubtedly stolen thunder from the Communists, especially since
 it offers the Burmese the same advantages without bloodshed, as well as pro-
 viding freedom from foreign domination and exploitation,  By the same token,
 the Government is still seek"n  a rapprochement with the PVO through their
 common "lef"tism," in order better to isolate the Communists as well as to re-
 duce overall insurgent strength.  However, its inability to usher in a utopia
 immediately after independence has benefited the Communists who blame the
 Government for the ills "resulting from connivance with imperialists."  Al-
 though the Government launched its program with much enthusiasm, the resources
 and qualified personnel were not available to carry forward successfully such
 a far-reaching program on such a broad front.  Furthermore, good intentions
 were too often marred by malfeasance in high office.  In other cases, hasty
 and ill-considered action, such as the nationalization of the Irrawaddy
 Flotilla Company, has resulted in additional financial burden.  Finally, the
 Government has been forced to divert more and more of its limited resources
 to unproductive military expenditures

 Recently, the Burmese Government appears to have become increasingly
 aware of its inability to promote peace and prosperity through its own efforts.
 Its policies have noticeably shifted from the extreme left towards the center.
 It has sought and received military assistance from the Commonwealth, but re-
 jected an offer of shorty-term financial aid on the grounds that the conditions
 wore too restrictive.  It has sponsored legislation designed to attract, rather
 than discourage, the introduction of foreign capital for the development of
 mineral resources, and has shown interest in the fourth point of the Presi-
 dent's inaugural address.  It has concurred in the US suggestion for a eonmon
 front policy regarding the recognition of a Chinese Cozmruni.st Government. The
 Prime Minister has recommended the negotiation of mutually beneficial treaties
 with nations having "common interests", and most recently the Foreign Linister
 stated that Burma probably would "consider favorably" any suggestions for a
 Pacific bloc.  Socialistreaction has boon one of reluctant asquiescence, and
 since the Socialists are the Government's chief supporters they could precipi-
 tate a serious political crisis at any time.  ?jithdrawal of their support could
 mean the Government's resignation, a split in the Socialist Party, or both.
 Although such developments are en';irely possible, it se ms likely that the
 parties concerned realize the disastrous consequences that are likely to be
 the result, and will attempt to avoid them at least temporarily.  Furthermore,
 the Government's changing attitude does not nean that is has abandoned its
 Marxist coloration, but that it is probably motivated by reasons of self-
 pre servation.Nevertheless, the new trend is an indication that Burmese leaders
 are at last discovering the real threat to their independence and arc turning
 in the only direction from which assistance is possible in maintaining that

 independence and restoring stability In Burma.
 CONCLUSIONS AD PROSPECTS
 Although a relatively small minority, Burmese Comunists are making
 a violent effort to overthrow the existing regime and establish their own
 administration over all of Burma.  While both Communist parties are effective-
 ly                     serving Soviet foreign policy, the BCP is considerably the stronger and
 more advanced in ideological sophistication.  The BCP has demonstrated its
 willingness to conform to the international Communist policy and its ability
 to execute instructions emanating from foreign sources.  It will probably con-
 tinue to do both at least as long as foreign control is relatively well-con-
 coaled and local control left largely in the hands of indigenous Comrnmistso
 Although the BCPts organization is imperfect and ,here is always the possibility
 of internal factionalism, it Is still capable of prolonged violence and of
 implementing its more immediate objectives.  It will constitute a continuing
 threat to Burmese stability, but it is unlikely to overthrow the Government
 in the immediate future through its own efforts.  However, it is entirely
 possible that its capabilities willbe enhanced as the Chinese Communists con-
 solidate their control of China.  As this occurs, It would seem logical that
 its orientation will gradually shift away from India towards China.
 eanwhile, although the present Government is anti-Communist and will
 probably continue its efforts to suppress Communist activities, it is politically
 and economically weak and unstable.  It is forced to dissipate its military
 strength against a variety of adversaries, and is subject to the fissiparous
 tendencies of its supporters.  Therefore, Communism in Burma will not be
 suppressed in the predictable future.  Such an eventuality will depend largely

 upon a much greater clarification of the lines dividing pro-and anti-Cormunists.
 To achieve these ends, the government must considerably intensify its efforts
 to establish itself in the minds of the Burmese as the true advocate of
 nationalism and of better conditions in Burma while identifying; the Communists
 as the proponents of violence, acting under foreign instructions.  In addi-
 tion, some kind of negotiated settlement will have to be reached with other
 insurgents and Greater confidence and assistance obtained from the various hill
 people who heretofore have generally been suspicious of the Burmese Government
 in Rangoon.  jheso efforts must be undertaken by the Burmese themselves, and
 the prospects for their fulfillment are not especially bright.  Paradoxically,
 the Government is likely to become increasingly dependent upon tVestern support
 and assistance, but its willingness and ability to resist Communism may be
 measured in direct ratio to the encouragement received from this source. Efforts
 to obtain such aid without exposing itself to charges of subservience to
 foreign interests will be a delicate procedure.  dhile ++estern assistance would
 undoubtedly increase the Burmese Government's ability and willingness to resist
 Co=nism, it cannot of itself provide a permanent solution to Burma's problems
 and restore stability under a non-Comrunist regimes
 All things considered, the Burmese Government's position vis-a-vis the
 Communists is not hopeless, but the time in which to achieve a decisive position
 is decidedly limited.
