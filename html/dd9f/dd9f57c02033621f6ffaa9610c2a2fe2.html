 Resolved, That during the consideration of     Mr. Speaker, I have here a letter from

 minutes to the distinguished gentleman    Mr. MAHON.  I would say with re-
 from California [Mr. SMITH] pending                                                              spect to equipment and clothing, for the
 which I yield myself such time as I may men in Vietnam that I know of no real

 (Mr. YOUNG asked and was given per-     Of course, there may be a temporary
 mission to revise and extend his re-    shortage at a given place at a given me-
 marks.)
 Mr. YOUNG.  Mr.  Speaker, House
 Resolution 773 provides that points of
 order shall be waived in the considera-
 tion of H.R. 13546, a bill making sup-
 plemental appropriations for the fiscal
 year ending June 30, 1966, and for other
 purposes.
 Mr.  Speaker,  H.R.  13546  includes
 $13,135,719,000, the amount of the budget
 estimate for the military assistance and
 economic assistance programs of the
 Government directly related to opera-
 tions in southeast Asia.  This involves
 an increase in the numbers of both mili-
 tary and civilian personnel, the increases
 in the operation and maintenance costs
 of men, machines, and structures; the
 production of aircraft, ordnance, ammu-
 nition, and other materiel; military and
 construction projects; selected and spe-
 cialized research and development pro-
 grams; and also economic assistance.
 Mr. Speaker, in this connection I
 would like to address a question to the
 chairman of the Committee on Appro-
 priations.  I wonder if the chairman
 would advise the House as to whether or
 not this bill appropriates a sufficient
 amount of money to carry on the war in
 Vietnam.
 Mr. MAHON. Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield to me?
 Mr. YOUNG.  I yield to the gentle-
 man.
 Mr. MAHON.  I believe so, at least for
 the time being. With the funds included
 in this bill we will have made available
 for the current fiscal year a total of
 about $61 billion for the Department of
 Defense.  We entered the current fiscal
 year with about $30 billion in the hands
 of the Department of Defense which had
 not been expended.  Most of those funds
 had been committed for such things as
 missiles, airplanes, submarines, ships,
 .and other long lead time items.  So I
 would say certainly from the financial
 standpoint the funds provided here are
 adequate for the foreseeable future.  Of
 course, we cannot tell whether peace will
 come or whether war will remain at the
 present level or whether it will escalate.
 So we do not know how much additional
 funds may be required even this year for
 the further prosecution of this war if it
 merit.  I shall be glad to present thls
 matter to the appropriate officials in the
 Department of Defense.  We conferred
 at great length with General Greene,
 the commandant of the Marine Corps,
 and discussed with him some problems
 with regard to supplies, but he did not
 complain of any serious problem of sup-
 plies in Vietnam at this time.
 Mr. GROSS.  Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. YOUNG. I yield to the gentleman
 from Iowa.
 Mr. GROSS.  I believe the hearing
 record is already clear that the commit-
 tee does not preclude the introduction of
 another supplemental appropriation bill
 with respect to expenditures for this pur-
 pose.  I seem to get the very definite
 impression that another supplemental is
 not precluded at all.
 Mr. MAHON. Mr. Speaker, if the gen-
 tleman will yield, I do hope to leave the
 very definite impression that another
 supplemental is not precluded.  In my
 opinion, and it would be my hope, there
 will be no further supplemental for
 fiscal 1966 related to the wax in Vietnam,
 but there may be a supplemental for
 fiscal 1967. We do not want to give to
 the Department of Defense a blank
 check.  Last year we did not want to
 give the Department of Defense billions
 of dollars for which it could not define a
 specific use. So we feel, as I am sure the
 gentleman from Iowa feels, when funds
 are required the officials of the executive
 branch should come to the Congress and
 request the funds, and then we will pro-
 vide them, as we are undertaking to do
 in this case.  However, no one can pre-
 dict the future. It has not been possible
 to predict it in any war which we have
 fought,
 Mr. GROSS. I understand that, but I
 am not too well satisfied, from a reading
 of the hearings, that you have adequately
 financed the situation as it presently
 stands.
 Mr. MAHON. Mr. Speaker, if the gen-
 tleman from Texas will yield further, we
 have just done the best we could under
 the circumstances.
 I must say that in another supple-
 mental bill which will be pending before
 the House of Representatives, probably
 continues.                              before Easter, funds will be carried al-
 YOUNG.  Mr. Speaker, I thank                                                                most to the extent of $1 billion because

 had they come to us on their own two
 feet and in not such objectionable com-
 pany.
 Mr. Speaker, since I have been in Con-
 gress I have protested these discrimina-
 tory taxes in good times and bad-in time
 of budget deficits and budget surpluses.
 There is simply no right time to vote for
 an unfair tax. I submit that the admin-
 istration has not tried hard enough either
 through economies here at home or
 through recommendations for tax equal-
 ity to properly provide the revenue need-
 ed to fulfill our most pressing commit-
 ments.
 Mr. HORTON. Mr. Speaker, since the
 President's state of the Union message,
 which contained his request for post-
 poning the repeal of telephone and auto-
 mobile excise taxes, I have been on rec-
 ord as strongly opposed to reinstituting
 these regressive taxes as a means of
 procuring the needed funds to finance
 the war in Vietnam.
 I was most encouraged when the Sen-
 ate last week adopted the amendment to
 keep the excise on residential phone
 service at its present 3-percent rate.
 Unfortunately, the conference commit-
 tee deleted the Senate amendment, with
 the result that the tax on local telephone
 service will again rise to 10 percent.
 Without any wavering in my strong sup-
 port for well-reasoned legislation to ob-
 tain the needed additional funds for use
 in Vietnam, I am reluctant to support
 the conference report because of the un-
 necessary burden it places on people in
 the lower income levels, to whom an
 automobile and telephone service are
 necessities, not luxuries, today.
 With this hesitation, I have decided
 to vote in favor of the conference com-
 mittee's compromise, because of another
 provision it contains. I am referring to
 the provision that will provide social
 security benefits to over 300,000 Amer-
 ican citizens who are reaching the age
 of 72 and are not covered by social se-
 curity under present law.  This provi-
 sion is an important step in broadening
 our social security system to cover those
 who had retired or were near retirement
 when Congress acted to cover jobs they
 had held.
 I have been urging the passage of this
 amendment to the Social Security Act
 for over a year now.  Across-the-board
 monthly benefits for persons reaching
 age 72 who do not meet normal quarter-
 coverage requirements was a major part
 of H.R. 5039, which I introduced last
 year-many provisions of which were
 later enacted into Public Law 89-97.
 Under this enlightened provision, per-
 sons who are not now receiving any
 State, Federal, or local pension, in most
 cases persons who are most in need, will
 receive $35 monthly through the social
 security system if they reach age 72 be-
 fore 1968.  For persons reaching age 72
 after 1967, this new provision provides
 that fewer quarters of covered employ-
 ment will be required for eligibility for
 social security benefits. Thus, over $120
 million will be made available to persons
 who qualify under this section.
 . While I have very serious reservations
 about the wisdom of reimposing the
 same excise taxes which Congress worked
 so diligently to repeal just last year, I
 cannot with conscience vote down this
 very necessary and enlightened step in
 the broadening of our social security laws
 to cover needy senior citizens.  I am
 gratified at the inclusion in this report
 of a major portion of my own social
 security legislative program.
 Thus, with noted reluctance, I am cast-
 ing my vote in favor of the conference
 committee's report on the Tax Adjust-
 ment Act.
 Mr. CLEVELAND.  Mr. Speaker, I rise
 to state that I will again vote, very re-
 luctantly, for this tax increase measure,
 called the Tax Adjustment Act of 1966:
 As I stated on February 23, when the bill
 was first approved by the House-sere
 page 3552 of the RECORD-only the ad-
 ministration's refusal to cut back on its
 unprecedented high level of domestic
 spending constrains me to vote for this
 bill.  In this absence of fiscal restraint
 on the part of the administration, which
 increases the dangers of inflation it be-
 comes necessary to provide the additional
 revenues in this legislation.  The costs
 of the war in Vietnam and threat of in-
 flation demands it.
 At the same time, I wish to add a word
 of high praise for the  amendment
 adopted in the Senate to give older per-
 sons at least some assistance by extend-
 ing a measure of social security protec-
 tion to many of those excluded from the
 program through no fault of their own.
 I am proud of the fact that my State's
 senior Senator, NORRIS COTTON, played
 such a prominent role in sponsoring this
 amendment  and getting it  adopted.
 With all the money being poured out by
 the Government on various welfare pro-
 grams, it is good to know that at least
 some will now go to relieve the needs of
 senior citizens directly, without Federal
 controls or new battalions of bureau-
 crats.  This is an antipoverty measure
 which I can support.  It follows the
 precedent we established at Republican
 insistence, when we provided medical
 care for the elderly not covered by social
 security.
 GENERAL LEAVE TO EXTEND

 Mr. GROSS. That is one of the items
 in your hearings here, and I am a little
 bit surprised that that item is not cov-
 ered in this bill.
 Mr. MAHON.  If the gentleman will
 yield further, the pending bill includes
 funds for the new rates of pay for the
 additional men in the Armed Forces.
 We have almost 400,000 more men in the
 Armed Forces than we previously had
 programed in the original 1966 budget.
 However, this bill does not take care of
 the supplemental required, as a result of
 the pay increase, for the originally pro-
 gramed numbers of military, which we
 provided for at the old rates in the
 regular 1966 appropriation.
 Mr. GROSS.  And yet this bill takes
 into account expenditures, other than for
 those directly related to Vietnam?
 Mr. MAHON.  To some quite limited
 extent.
 Mr. GROSS.  Yes, to some extent.
 This is the point I am trying to make,
 that this supplemental is not all-inclu-
 sive; that we are already looking at an-
 other supplemental to take care of the
 pay increase.
 Mr. MAHON.  The gentleman is cor-
 rect.
 Mr. GROSS.  And, I cannot help but
 be a little surprised that it is not con-
 tained in this bill rather than another
 bill yet to come to the floor of the House.
 Mr. MAHON.  We had thought that
 we should present all the pay increases
 for the whole Government in one bill.  It
 is anticipated that that bill may be be-
 fore the House for action week after next.
 Mr.  GROSS. One other question:
 Will the gentleman from Texas [Mr.
 Yout' G] explain briefly to the House why
 points of order are waived in this bill?
 Mr. YOUNG.  Of course, it is obvi-
 ous that the points of order ' are waived
 because the authorization bill has not
 been passed or signed by the President of
 the United States.
 Mr. GROSS.  Has it passed the other
 body?
 Mr. YOUNG. Yes; it is in conference.
 Mr. GROSS.  But it has not been
 signed by the President?
 Mr. YOUNG.  No; it is in conference.
 Mr. MAHON.  The economic assist-
 ance portion of the bill is in conference.
 Mr. YOUNG.  The foreign aid part
 is still in conference, and the other part
 of the bill has gone to the President but
 has not been signed.
 Mr. LATTA.  Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. YOUNG.  I yield to the gentle-
 man from Ohio, for a question.
 Mr. LATTA.  Mr. Speaker, I did not
 intend to raise this question at this time,
 but since the chairman of the Committee
 on Appropriations has raised it, I am
 concerned about shortages of clothing
 that have been revealed during the hear-
 ings which have been held by the Com-
 mittee on Armed Services of the House
 of Representatives, as well as in the hear-
 ings which have been held by the Armed
 Services Committee of the other body.
 Do I understand the gentleman to say
 that there were no shortages of clothing
 in the Marine Corps, or that these short-
 ages were being taken care of?
 Mr. Speaker, I am addressing my ques-
 tion to the chairman of the Committee
 on Appropriations.
 Mr. MAHON.  Mr. Speaker, if  the
 gentleman from Texas will yield further,
 the Department of Defense is requesting
 additional funds here to meet certain
 requirements for additional manpower.
 We have increased manpower to the
 extent of about 400,000 men in the last
 year.
 Mr. Speaker, insofar as I know there
 are no significant shortages in South
 Vietnam.  There are some shortages
 within the continental United States
 which are of no serious import in my
 judgment. And, these requirements are
 being met.
 Mr. Speaker, there could not be a mili-
 tary effort of this magnitude without
 some shortages showing up here and
 there.  The Department of Defense has
 tried to husband its funds rather well,
 in my opinion, in recent years.  Officials
 have not asked for supplies to last for
 the next 20 or 30 years of certain items,
 as has been the case in some isolated
 instances heretofore.
 Mr. Speaker, I believe this more accu-
 rate and careful budgeting procedure is
 in the public interest, and generally
 would be approved.  Of course, we do not
 want any shortages that would be sig-
 nificant, we do not want any shortages
 at all, but these shortages will occur in
 any war.  Therefore, we have to do the
 best we can to see that these shortages
 are not significant or hurtful to the
 fighting forces.
 Mr. LATTA.  Mr. Speaker, if the gen-
 tleman will yield further, since  the
 gentleman from Texas has mentioned
 General Green's testimony, his testimony
 before the Committee on Armed Services
 revealed that there were shortages of
 clothing, but that they were being taken
 care of through the medium of decreased
 clothing allowances.
 Mr. MAHOON. This relates to the con-
 tinental United States, and not to South
 Vietnam, I believe.
 Mr. LATTA.  There will be no de-
 creased allowances as far as clothing is
 concerned for our South Vietnam fight-
 ing soldiers?
 Mr. MAHON.  Not, I believe, for the
 soldiers in South Vietnam.  There is no
 clothing problem about which I know,
 with reference to personnel in Vietnam,
 except some isolated instance here or
 there, but some of the clothing under
 order for the increased strength of the
 Marine Corps will take a little time for
 delivery.  But there is no serious situa-
 tion here.                                                        And the gentleman to whom
 the gentleman from Ohio referred, when
 testifying before the House Armed Serv-
 ices Committee, points out that he thinks
 the Marine Corps will be able to handle
 this matter without any serious effect
 upon the readiness of the marines.
 Mr. LATTA. Likewise I will point out
 to the gentleman that General Greene
 in .his testimony before the Committee
 on Armed Services stated in their exami-
 nation of the problem, meaning the
 problem of ammunition as I recall, they
 found six different types of ammunition
 in which there were indications of short-
 ages.  This Is General Greene's testi-
 mony., Are there sufficient funds to take
 care of these shortages?
 Mr. MAHON. The bill provides $2 bil-
 lion for ammunition and associated
 equipment.  There are certain new types
 of ammunition that are not immediately
 available which would be desirable for
 use in Vietnam which are not now be-
 ing used.                                                                                                 But we have sufficient fire-
 power to meet the requirements. What-
 ever the deficiencies are in our prosecu-
 tion of the war in Vietnam, they are not
 brought about by the lack of money or
 of supplies, in my judgment.
 Mr. LATTA.  I thank the gentleman.
 Mr. YOUNG. Mr. Speaker, I urge the
 adoption of the pending resolution.
 The SPEAKER pro tempore.  The
 Chair recognizes the gentleman from
 California [Mr. SMrrH].
 Mr.  SMITH  of   California. Mr.
 Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
 may use.
 (Mr. SMITH of California asked and
 was given permission to revise and ex-
 tend his remarks.)
 Mr.   SMITH   of   California.  Mr.
 Speaker, House Resolution 773 does waive
 all points of order so far as the bill H.R.
 13546 is concerned, the supplemental de-
 fense appropriation bill for 1966.                                                                                              As I
 understand it, the points of order were
 requested to be waived for two different
 reasons.  The first is the two bills that
 have been passed, I think $415 million
 for the foreign aid bill, and I believe the
 other one having to do with the armed
 services and supplies, have not been
 signed by the President of the United
 States with the result that we cannot
 appropriate unless there is first a law on
 the books authorizing us to do so. That
 is the first point.
 The second point, as I understand it, is
 that there is certain language in the bill
 in the nature of legislation in an appro-
 priation bill which is against the rules of
 the House and the Committee on Rules
 was asked to waive that so that we could
 proceed with this legislation here today.
 I think the total amount of the bill
 is somewhere around $13 billion, $12.3
 billion in new military spending and $415
 million in connection with the foreign
 aid matter that we passed here a short
 time ago, the majority of which goes to
 Vietnam, some to Thailand, some to Laos,
 and some to the Dominican Republic.
 Then there is $375 million for military
 assistance projects previously authorized
 and begun.
 There has been some discussion as to
 whether or not the World War II lan-
 guage goes too far; whether that au-
 thority should be given to the Depart-
 ment of Defense or not. So far as I am
 concerned, I feel our men are in Vietnam
 and they are fighting and I, for one,
 intend to give them all the equipment and
 ammunition and everything that we can
 to help them to do their job so that we
 can get them back home as quickly as
 we possibly can.
 Mr. Speaker, I support the waiver of
 the points of order and I support the
 rule and I support the bill.
 Mr. Speaker, I have no requests for
 time so far as I know.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE           March 15, 1966
 Mr. YOUNG.  Mr. Speaker, I move the
 previous question.
 The previous question was ordered.
 The resolution was agreed to.
 Mr. MAHON.  Mr. Speaker, I move
 that the House resolve itself into the
 Committee of the Whole House on the
 State of the Union for the consideration
 of the bill (H.R. 13546) making supple-
 mental defense appropriations for the
 fiscal year ending June 30, 1966, and for
 other purposes; and pending that mo-
 tion I ask unanimous consent that gen-
 eral debate thereon be limited to not to
 exceed 3 hours, the time to be divided
 equally between the gentleman from
 Ohio [Mr. Bowl and myself.
 Mr. Speaker, I do not think we will use
 more than 3 hours in general debate, but
 we do not want to preclude any debate
 that the House desires to have on this
 important legislation.
 The SPEAKER pro tempore.  Is there
 objection to the request of the gentle-
 man from Texas?
 There was no objection.
 The SPEAKER pro tempore.  The
 question is on the motion offered by the
 gentleman from Texas.
 The motion was agreed to.
 IN THE COMMITTEE Or THE WHOLE
 Accordingly, the House resolved it-
 self into the Committee of the Whole
 House on the State of the Union for
 the consideration of the bill, H.R. 1a546,
 with Mr. WRIGHT in the chair.
 The Clerk read the title of the bill.
 By unanimous consent, the first read-
 ing of the bill was dispensed with.
 The CHAIRMAN.  Under the unani-
 mous-consent agreement, the gentleman
 from Texas [Mr. MAHONI will be recog-
 nized for 11/2 hours and the gentleman
 from Ohio [Mr. Bowl will be recognized
 for 11/2 hours.
 The Chair recognizes the gentleman
 from Texas [Mr. MAHONI.
 Mr. MAHON.  Mr. Chairman, I yield
 myself 10 minutes.
 The   CHAIRMAN.  The  gentleman
 from Texas is recognized for 10 minutes.
 Mr. MAHON. This is the first appro-
 priation bill to be considered by the Con-
 gress at this session. We have been re-
 quested by the executive branch to ap-
 propriate for the forthcoming fiscal year
 about $121 billion.  The bill before us
 of course, is not applicable to the 1967
 fiscal year but, rather, to the current
 fiscal year.
 There has been so much said about
 the war in Vietnam through all media
 and in many public places, including
 this body and the other body, that there
 are many who feel, perhaps, that they
 have heard enough.
 But this bill totals $13 billion.  It is
 the first opportunity of the House of
 Representatives to express its will on the
 urgent request of the President for all
 of the additional funds to prosecute the
 war in Vietnam.
 This supplemental appropriation re-
 quest for the Department of Defense
 has occupied much of the time and ef-
 fort of many Members of the legislative
 branch in recent weeks.  The President's
 request for the supplemental funds ar-
 rived here on Capitol Hill on the 19th
 day of January. The House Appropria-
 tions Committee began its hearings on
 the measure on January 26 and con-
 cluded hearings on March 3.
 Three subcommittees-the Subcom-
 mittee on Defense Appropriations, the
 Subcommittee on Military Construction,
 and the Subcommittee on Foreign Oper-
 ations-were all involved in the con-
 sideration of this request.
 The full Committee on Appropriations
 met last Friday and ordered the bill re-
 ported to the House, and it was sched-
 uled for consideration today.
 Since some of the amounts requested
 required additional authorization, several
 of the legislative committees of the Con-
 gress have given their attention to this
 matter.  The  Committee  on  Armed
 Forces of the House held hearings begin-
 ning February 3 and ending on Feb-
 ruary 17, having had 8 days of hearings
 onmany of the matters in the bill that
 is before us today.
 The authorization bill was reported
 from the House Armed Services Commit-
 tee on February 18 and passed the House
 on March 1.
 In the other body, joint hearings were
 held by the Armed Services Committee
 and the Defense Appropriations Sub-
 committee beginning on January 20 and
 ending on February 3-5 days of hear-
 ings.
 The bill was reported to the Senate on
 February 10.  The Senate debate began
 on that day and continued until the
 Senate passed the bill on March 1.
 The conference report on that au-
 thorization bill was filed on March 10
 .and was adopted by both the Houses
 last week, as the Members know.
 Since the pending bill provides sup-
 plemental appropriations for economic
 assistance, the Foreign Affairs Commit-
 tee of the House and the Foreign Rela-
 tions Committee of the Senate have con-
 sidered the matter and drafted the
 required  authorizing  legislation.  The
 House Foreign Affairs Committee began
 hearings on January 26. The committee
 held 3 days of hearings. The authoriza-
 tion bill for economic assistance was
 considered on the floor on February 24.
 The Senate Foreign Relations Com-
 mittee began hearings on January 28 and
 continued hearings until March 3, hear-
 ings being held on a total of 8 days. The
 other body considered the Economic As-
 sistance Authorization bill, as we did, on
 March 10.
 The conference on this economic as-
 sistance part of the legislation has not
 yet been concluded, and the legislation,
 `of course, has not been signed into law.
 Neither had the military authorization
 portion of this legislation until today.
 .For that reason a rule waiving points of
 order was requested by the Appropri-
 ations Committee last week and granted
 by the Rules Committee.
 So it is evident that Congress has been
 preoccupied with the issue of the Viet-
 nam war since we assembled in January,
 and properly so, I would say.
 bast year, during the consideration of
 the Defense Appropriation and Authori-
 zation bills, it became apparent that a
 supplemental appropriation would be
 needed early this year if the war should
 continue. We were hoping and praying
 that it would not.  This view was gen-
 erally taken by Members of the House
 and Members of the other body who deal
 in depth with military requirements.
 This view was also taken by officials of
 the Defense Department.
 We were told that additional funds
 would probably be needed, but since they
 could not then pinpoint the specific
 funds; they would not ask us for blank
 checks for financing the war.   It was
 generally thought that early this year a
 request for additional funds would be
 presented.  Early this year, on January
 19, the request came.  So it is no sur-
 prise that we have been engaged in re-
 cent weeks in debate and discussion of
 this important matter.
 Not only this, but during the course of
 the consideration thus far of the pend-
 ing $13 billion appropriation, it has been
 apparent that most Members feel that
 the additional amounts are required.
 The truth is that there has been no
 real question in the minds of the over-
 whelming majority of the Members of
 ,this body that the funds requested are
 needed. I will go further, and say that
 many feel that additional funds may be
 required in fiscal year 1967 for the De-
 partment of Defense, that is funds in
 excess of the budget request.
 This certainly is my view, but no one
 can tell the turn which the war will take
 and, therefore, what the requirements
 may actually be.
 It is true that we cannot predict, as
 I say, the course of the war, the chances
 for peace, or the degree of intensity of
 the fighting.
 We do not know what the Commu-
 nists might do in southeast Asia or else-
 where.  We have no way of knowing.
 Hence, it is inevitable that some uncer-
 tainties will confront us in the future, as
 they have confronted us in the past in
 dealing with these matters.
 When and if additional sums are re-
 quired, I would make bold to say for the
 House of Representatives that everyone
 can be sure that those additional funds
 will be approved by the House of Repre-
 sentatives.
 Mr. GERALD R. FORD.  Mr. Chair-
 man, will the gentleman yield?
 Mr. MAHON.  I yield to the able mi-
 nority leader.
 Mr. GERALD R. FORD.  Mr. Chair-
 man, I am glad the chairman of the Com-
 mittee on Appropriations has pointed out
 that there are many, many uncertainties
 as to the precise course of the conflict in
 Vietnam.  President Johnson, as the
 elected Commander in Chief, does not
 himself know exactly what decisions he
 must make in the crucial days ahead. We
 do not know today what the President
 must do in the way of a commitment for
 more strength on the ground or in the air
 or on the sea.
 However, I gather, from what the gen-
 tleman from Texas is saying, that a
 Member of the House who votes for this
 Defense Department appropriation is
 giving to the Commander in Chief the
 day-to-day authority to carry on the
 execution and implementation of our Na-
 tion's position of strength in South
 Vietnam.  An "aye" vote on this bill
 today means that one supports adequate

 military strength to meet successfully
 the challenge of Communist aggression
 in South Vietnam.
 Mr. MAHON.  This, I believe, would be
 a fair interpretation of a vote in favor
 of the pending legislation.
 Mr. GERALD R. FORD.  I thank the
 gentleman.
 Mr. MAHON.  It is true that we can-
 not tell the degree of the escalation, but
 it is my view-and I have no inside in-
 formation-that the probabilities are
 that the war will escalate, that it will
 grow in intensity, because I do not think
 our opponents are yet ready to go to the
 conference table.
 We have given them ample opportu-
 nity. We have had the bombing pause,
 and we have been most tolerant and con-
 siderate in undertaking to convince our
 opponents, and the entire world, of our
 desire for peace.  Our efforts have not
 been successful thus far.  We have no
 other alternative than to prosecute this
 war to a successful conclusion.
 It is in this context and under these
 circumstances that the Committee on
 Appropriations brings this request to you
 today for your consideration.
 I would like to say that it is due to
 the foresight of Congress and to the fore-
 sight of the executive branch that we
 are as well prepared as we are for the
 conditions which confront us in the
 world at this time.  Beginning in 1950
 with the Korean war, we have kept our
 Military Establishment in a considerable
 degree of readiness. We have appro-
 priated large sums of money for defense.
 We have spent money for defense at a
 rather higli level since the early 1950's
 in order to be ready to meet aggression
 if aggression came.
 I should call your attention to some
 significant facts:
 First. We have carried more than
 200,000 men and the. arms and equipment
 to support them and to support our
 allies' army of more than 800,000 men,
 by air and by sea, more than 10,000 miles
 from our shores.
 Second. We have wisely protected the
 lives of our flghtingmen by expending
 munitions at tremendous rates. We have
 the weapons and ammunition to make
 this possible.  If we did not, more lives
 would be lost.  We program the expendi-
 ture of 1 billion rounds per year of small-
 arms ammunition, for instance, and
 1,700,000 bombs.
 Third. We have been building up our
 conventional forces substantially since
 1961.  For example:
 First. We have added $50 billion to the
 defense program since 1960 for this
 purpose.
 Second. We had achieved a 100-per-
 cent increase in airlift capability.'
 Third. The number of combat-ready
 Army divisions has been increased 45
 percent.
 Fourth. The number of combat heli-
 copters, upon which the mobility of our
 forces in Vietnam depends, has been in-
 creased 45 percent.
 Fifth. The number of Air Force fighter
 squadrons has been increased 51 percent.
 If the Congress and the Defense De-
 partment had not had the foresight to
 program these increases, we would in-
 deed have had real supply problems and
 American lives would have been unneces-
 sarily sacrificed.
 So it is as a result of this policy, that
 the Members have supported, that we are
 as well prepared as we are for the war in
 which we find ourselves.
 I should like to say this: The United
 States has been better prepared for and
 has acted more quickly and more effi-
 ciently to cope with the demands of this
 war than any other war in our entire
 history. This understanding is necessary
 to a proper perspective of the situation.
 We hear allegations of shortages and
 inefficiencies.  There are some shortages
 and inefficiences which should surprise
 no one in an effort this large.  But the
 overall picture as to military strength
 and readiness is amazingly good.  We
 have every reason to be proud of our
 men, and not only of our men but of the
 equipment which has been provided by
 the foresight of the Government in
 recent years.
 I say that for all of the administrations
 involved.  No shortage of equipment or
 supplies has adversely affected the con-
 duct of the war insofar as our hearings
 have been able to determine.
 There is every indication that our
 forces in Vietnam are being well led.
 General Westmoreland seems to have
 the complete confidence of military and
 civilian leaders in the executive branch
 of the Government, and this, of course,
 includes the President.
 General Westmoreland also seems to
 have the full confidence of the Members
 of Congress who have made on-the-spot
 checks of the situation in southeast Asia.
 The bravery of our troops and their
 morale is without question.  We have
 every reason to be proud of the per-
 formance of the Nation as a whole in
 this time of difficulty and trial.
 There seems to be little reason to
 argue about the amount of money re-
 quested in this bill.  We are going to
 need all of these funds.  We have spent
 24 days in hearings in the Committee on
 Appropriations already this year explor-
 ing our military requirements for funds.
 One cannot separate this supplemental
 from the fiscal 1967 regular budget for
 defense.  We have had Secretary Mc-
 Namara before our committee on defense
 requirements of the Nation a total of 5
 days, and we have had many other wit-
 nesses, also.  We have been giving con-
 sideration to this matter, and properly
 so, since the beginning of the session.
 We will continue to do so, and we hope
 that in a couple of months we can bring
 the new bill before you.  However, cer-
 tainly, for the moment, we should sup-
 port this legislation and provide the
 equipment, the clothing, the ammuni-
 tion, and the other things that are
 needed now.
 In this bill before us we provide for
 2,005 additional helicopters which are
 very much needed in the type of war that
 we are fighting.  We are providing for
 the procurement of 906 fixed-wing air-
 craft.  We are providing the huge sum
 of $2,078 million for munitions, weapons
 of war, and associated equipment. So it
 is very evident to me that this is an im-
 portant and necessary installment for
 the active prosecution of the war in
 Vietnam.
 Briefly, the bill provides-

 Vietnam, are also located in the United

 Philippines.
 When we vote for this bill I think we
 will show to the Nation and to the en-
 tire world that the elected representa-
 tives of the people stand firmly together
 in resisting any program of appeasement
 or of vacillation and are supporting a
 program of unyielding opposition to ag-
 gression.  By our action in supporting
 this bill we put the country and the world
 on notice that we feel that we in this
 country have a vital stake in the outcome
 of the war in Vietnam.  It is true that
 we want to be helpful to the Vietnamese,
 but we are not spending all of these
 billions of dollars and the lives of'our
 men only, to be helpful to the Vietnam-
 ese.                                                                                            We are trying to obtain, peace in
 the world, which happens to be very im-
 portant to the welfare of all humanity.
 Mr. BOW.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 15
 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
 fornia, the distinguished ranking mem-
 ber of the Subcommitee on Defense Ap-
 propriations on the minority side [Mr.
 LI 'scoMB 1 .
 Mr. LIPSCOMB.  Mr. Chairman, the
 bill before the House today, H.R. 13546,
 provides supplemental defense funds for
 the fiscal year 1966 budget totaling $13,-
 135,719,000 in new obligational authority
 as requested by the President for mili-
 tary functions and military and eco-
 nomic assistance to support our opera-
 tions in southeast Asia.
 This measure is of vital importance to
 our security and welfare for the United
 States must remain ready and -able to
 act in the national interest and to sup-
 port such action fully.
 As approved by the Appropriations
 Committee, the Department of Defense
 portions of the bill, which total $12,345,-
 719,000, provide for the following:
 Approved For Release 2005/06/29 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000400040012-1
 5554
 Approved For CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  HOUSE 000400040`1M-arch 15, 1966
 For military personnel, the bill pro-
 vides $1,620 million which will support,
 in addition to that previously approved,
 a net increase of approximately 113,000
 military personnel and certain additions
 to the Army National Guard and other
 Reserve components.
 In the area of operation and mainte-
 nance, the bill proposes an appropria-
 tion of $2,316,269,000.
 For procurement of military supplies,
 the bill includes $7,019,400,000. Broadly
 speaking, this includes funding for am-
 munition, various types of rotary and
 fixed wing aircraft, various types of ve-
 hicles, electronic and communication
 equipment, and for other items such as
 ships, spare parts, clothing and other
 consumables.  In some cases the stocks
 are ' exhausted or are dangerously low,
 and these funds are needed to replenish
 the supply.
 For research, development, test, and
 evaluation the supplemental request pro-
 vides $151,650,000, much of which will
 be devoted to special needs generated by
 the Vietnam war.  This includes such
 programs as an increase in medical re-
 search to provide new drugs to combat
 a severe strain of drug resistant malaria,
 for work in developing aircraft suppres-
 sive fire systems, helicopter modification,
 developing a fast deployment logistic
 ship-FDL-and to speed up develop-
 ment of advanced radar techniques for
 surveillance purposes, and to modify air-
 craft to increase their effectiveness in
 their close air support missions in a
 southeast Asia environment.
 Military construction funds in the bill
 total $1,238,400,000.  This is for con-
 struction projects both in the continental
 United States and in the southeast Asia
 area at bases, airfields, ports, and related
 facilities.
 Also the bill includes $375 million re-
 lating to military assistance and $415
 million for the Agency for International
 Development for economic assistance in
 Vietnam.
 COMMITMENT IN VIETNAM
 Mr. Chairman, I support H.R. 13546.
 There should be no question in anyone's
 mind about the necessity of providing
 completely ample funds to support our
 commitment in Vietnam and related
 areas. Nor should there be any reserva-
 tion about the need to supply our Ameri-
 can boys fighting over there with the
 necessary arms, ammunition, and other
 requirements.  Prompt passage of this
 measure would also illustrate to our
 fighting men, our citizens, and our ene-
 mies that we are willing and able to take
 the steps that are necessary to back up
 our country's commitment to insure free-
 dom in South Vietnam and prevent the
 further expansion of communism.
 At the same time, I believe that addi-
 tional comments on this measure and the
 defense picture generally are necessary.
 The escalation of the conflict in Viet-
 nam Intensified in February of last year.
 But even in view of the worsening Viet-
 nam situation last year the fiscal year
 1966 defense budget originally submitted
 to Congress was tight," as described by
 Department of Defense witnesses before
 our subcommittee.  No amendment to
 the fiscal year 1966 original request for
 additional funds was made by the admin-
 istration to support the increased activ-
 ity in southeast Asia during the time the
 House Appropriation Subcommittee on
 Defense held several months of hearings
 and the bill was taken up and passed by
 the House in June.  The only action
 taken, which amounted in large part to
 a token gesture as far as the amount of
 funds was concerned, was the supple-
 mental request for fiscal year 1965 for a
 $700 million emergency fund for south-
 east Asia, approved by the Congress last
 May.
 Because of this fact and our deep con-
 cern that there must be adequate, timely
 funding for the defense program, two
 other members of the Defense Appropria-
 tions Subcommittee and I felt compelled
 to make the following statement in addi-
 tional views in the committee report last
 June on the regular fiscal year 1966
 budget as submitted to the House:
 It is our firm belief that appropriations
 must be sufficient to carry out successfully
 U.S. commitments anywhere in the world.
 American personnel in Vietnam must be
 equipped and supported in such a degree as
 will give maximum assurance of safety and a
 capability to carry out their duties.  We be-
 lieve the President should immediately revise
 this fiscal year 1966 defense budget with a
 view toward requesting the Congress to pro-
 vide for the unplanned and unprogramed
 expenditures which have resulted from his
 decision to assume a greater role in southeast
 Asia (H. Rept. No. 528, 89th Cong., let Bess.,
 p. 63).
 Despite repeated 'urgings such as this,
 no change in the original fiscal year 1966
 budget request was received until August
 of last year, almost 7 months after the
 increased action in Vietnam. Then, the
 request was made for a $1.7 billion south-
 east Asia emergency fund add-on which
 was amended into the House version of
 the defense bill by the Senate.  Even
 then, this added amount covered only a
 fraction of the needs, to start increasing
 production rates and construction proj-
 ects, and some other items that were
 critically needed. It was too obvious not
 to be widely recognized at the time that
 the $1.7 billion amendment did little
 more than begin to provide the funds
 needed.
 The $12.3 billion supplemental request
 we are considering today for Department
 of Defense, military functions, was pre-
 sented to Congress in January, only sev-
 eral months later. We were told by wit-
 nesses who appeared to testify for the
 $12.3 billion defense portion of the sup-
 plemental bill that the needs were not
 precisely known before this time.  It
 is of course, understood that our needs in
 situations such as this cannot be iden-
 tified precisely.  As a matter of fact it
 is clear from the testimony that the needs
 are still not precisely known., But from
 the evidence on hand it seems clear also
 that had the budget request been sub-
 mitted earlier, it could have prevented
 extensive budgetary manipulations that
 have been going on within the Depart-
 ment of Defense.
 DEFICIENCIES IN BUDGETING AND PLANNING
 Let me illustrate some of the results of
 this type of budgeting and planning in
 the defense program.
 The Secretary of Defense has used all
 of the discretionary funds he had avail-
 able in the construction program for
 Vietnam.  He has virtually exhausted
 research and development emergency
 funds.  In addition there has been
 extensive use of his transfer authority
 and reprograming of funds to meet criti-
 cal needs.
 As a matter of fact it was brought out
 in the testimony that this bill would have
 to be approved by approximately March
 1, which of course passed 2 weeks ago, to
 prevent further budgetary maneuvering
 and the use of emergency actions.
 Secretary McNamara himself stated
 that if the funds were not provided by
 March 1:
 We might have to take certain emergency
 actions to keep on schedule and those ac-
 tions would not make for as orderely an
 operation and as efficient an operation as we
 would have if the bill is enacted by March 1.
 MILITARY PERSONNEL
 In the area of military personnel, for
 the first time funds for military person-
 nel have been requested and are in this
 budget covering the escalation of activi-
 ty.                                                                                            Also, for the first time the matter of
 combat pay for our men in southeast Asia
 is adequately covered since the escalation
 of activity.  The Department of Defense
 up until this time has been handling the
 increased regular personnel and combat
 pay requirements by using up available
 personnel funds.  This is just no way to
 budget and to handle financing for the
 pay of our military personnel.
 This supplemental does not even in-
 clude funds to take care of military pay
 increases approved last year.  The De-
 partment of Defense has submitted still
 another separate supplemental request
 for this purpose as part of a Government-
 wide bill.  That request, for an addi-
 tional $863 million, was submitted to
 Congress March 8, 1966.  Serious diffi-
 culties meeting personnel expenses can
 be expected if the supplemental pay re-
 quest is not approved soon.
 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE
 Though the Vietnam escalation began
 last February, this bill provides the first
 appropriation for operation and mainte-
 nance for fiscal year 1966 funds to reflect
 our increased needs in southeast Asia.
 Operation  and maintenance  includes
 such critical items as fuel, logistical and
 operational support, and medical sup-
 port to all the services.  The fiscal year
 1966 budget, including the $1.7 billion
 add-on for southeast Asia, which was
 signed into law last September did not
 include such funds. Increased require-
 ments in this area have been handled by
 the Department of Defense by shifting of
 funds to meet emergency needs.
 PROCUREMENT
 Procurement for vital military equip-
 ment such as aircraft, weapons, vehicles,
 and ammunition at more than $7 billion
 makes up the major portion of this sup-
 plemental request.
 Analysis of this item reveals that a
 portion of the request is for replenish-
 ment of war reserve stocks. This need,
 in my view, should have been recognized
 many months earlier, for our stock levels
 were and are known and it should be
 readily recognized, that any escalation
 would dip further into the stockpiles.

 After the various branches of service
 submitted their individual requests to
 the Department of Defense for the origi-
 nal. fiscal year 1966 budget, numerous
 cuts were made by the Secretary. This
 action is expected and generally is
 neither unusual nor objectionable. How-
 ever, it does become a matter of concern
 when a budget is presented which should
 and could more adequately have antici-
 pated critical developments.  This bill,
 and to some extent the August 1965 $1.7
 billion amendment, contain some of the
 very items which were cut last year by
 the Secretary of Defense from the serv-
 ices' request for fiscal year 1966 in such
 areas as aircraft, spares, repair parts,
 and support material, all vital to the
 conduct of the war.
 Now we come to a situation almost
 completely opposite to the examples I
 have been discussing. While it is neces-
 sary to have funds required for our de-
 fense program requested and approved in
 a timely manner, it is equally true that
 responsible  budgeting  requires  that
 money requests be considered in orderly
 schedules commensurate with our needs
 at the time and not swept through in
 supplemental bills.
 Some of the items that properly should
 be  included in  the  regular defense
 budget for fiscal year 1967 which will
 come up later in the session have been
 injected into this supplemental. A num-
 ber of items amounting to hundreds of
 millions of dollars were deleted by the
 Office of the Secretary of Defense from
 the fiscal year 1967 regular budget re-
 quest by the service branches and moved
 into the supplemental request that we
 are discussing today.
 Additionally when it is realized that
 this $12.3 billion defense supplemental
 request is for fiscal year 1966 which has
 less than 4 months to go, other questions
 must be raised. For example, consider-
 ing the long leadtime needed to start
 up production or to increase production
 rates, this, coupled with the large quan-
 tities involved, indicates that a portion
 of the procurement funds could have
 been included in the regular fiscal year
 1967 budget request.  Sufficient funds
 could have been included in this supple-
 mental request to accelerate the produc-
 tion rate for long lead parts and toolpg
 and fund production items to carry
 through the 4-month period.  Such a
 procedure would have had the effect of
 moving many millions of dollars into the
 fiscal year 1967 budget with no ill effects
 upon scheduled deliveries.
 This is the type of budgeting taking
 place in such a crucial area as procure-
 ment. One could come to the conclusion
 that this has been done in an effort to
 make the regular 1967 budget look lower.
 The picture is further clouded by the
 fact that items are to be procured to fill
 needed requirements as a result of attri-
 tion which occurred during the previous
 3- to 4-year period.
 RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST, AND EVALUATION
 With regard to the request for supple-
 mental appropriations for research, de-
 velopment, test, and evaluation, it has
 been said repeatedly that our planning
 was aimed at enabling us to pursue the
 type of conflict as is going on in Vietnam
 in an expeditious manner.  Yet it took
 an escalated activity in Vietnam to pro-
 duce a fund request to support a level
 of effort needed to make these new find-
 ings and weapons available quickly.
 Though we can hopefully say that these
 funds should provide a measure of im-
 provement, some other research and de-
 velopment programs are being funded at
 a level of effort lower than a realistic
 assessment of the overall threat would
 indicate they should be.
 LANGUAGE CHANGE
 This supplemental package includes
 equal to accounts payable.  The new
 guage change contained in section 101
 of the bill with regard to the working
 capital funds, known as stock funds.
 The language change will eliminate the
 requirement to maintain cash balances
 equal to accounts payable.  The new
 language provides for transfer between
 funds and states that balances "may be
 maintained in only such amounts as are
 necessary at any time for cash disburse-
 ments to be made from such funds."  If
 this change of language had not been
 proposed by the Secretary of Defense in
 this bill, it would have been necessary
 for the Secretary to ask for another $350
 to $500 million.
 From an accounting standpoint and
 based on the brief look the subcommittee
 had of this item, it appears to be a rea-
 sonable  proposal.   However,  because
 there was not time to completely eval-
 uate it, the committee is requiring the
 Department of Defense to provide quar-
 terly reports giving the financial status
 of each working capital fund, including
 information as to any adjustments that
 have been made as between the working
 capital funds.  Congress must keep close
 watch on this item and take appropriate
 action if it is found that this procedure
 is not working properly.
 CONCLUSIONS
 Our men in Vietnam are serving
 bravely  and    with  great  distinction.
 They are fighting to preserve and ad-
 vance freedom in the world against
 Communist aggression.   Based on my
 observations in Vietnam last fall and
 from testimony in the hearing, their
 morale is high, their motivation strong.
 They are there to win.
 Such practices as I have described
 here in my view are neither good man-
 agement nor do they reflect the maxi-
 mum in effective planning which is so
 necessary to insure that the men and
 material will be where they are needed
 in a manner which will afford our serv-
 icemen worldwide the ability to perform
 their mission and receive the maximum
 protection for their safety.
 The result has been patchwork defense
 budgeting in many respects, which is
 both unfitting of our great Nation and
 not in keeping with the seriousness and
 importance of the Vietnam effort.
 Congress should be concerned for the
 available evidence suggests efforts to re-
 duce congressional control over the de-
 fense budget.  It suggests that better
 defense planning and management could
 be done.  Congress should be disturbed
 because the evidence also suggests that
 the decisions as to when budgetary re-
 quests are to be submitted and how much
 5555
 each of these should contain are not
 necessarily determined solely by our
 military requirements, but that arbi-
 trarily shifting  and juggling is done
 to influence, impress, or convince the
 public, depending en what is considered
 most needed at any particular time.
 A lack of effective planning could un-
 dermine not only our effort in Vietnam
 but weaken our national security as a
 whole. We live in dangerous times that
 warrant the utmost vigilance and pre-
 paredness.  The threat to Vietnam is not
 an isolated incident, and therefore we
 cannot blind ourselves to problem areas
 in the rest of the world, now or in the
 future.
 I strongly urge the administration to
 review our overall defense posture and
 policies, with a broad view of our com-
 mitments, not just Vietnam.  Because
 of the effect the conflict in Vietnam has
 had upon our defense structure there is
 a need for such a review immediately.
 I feel confident that Congress will assist
 in any way it can in such a review and
 provide the necessary authority for any
 legitimate increases or modifications that
 appear to be warranted. In this regard,
 Congress must receive the full benefit of
 military judgment without constraints.
 Congress must have frank discussions by
 both the civilian and military members
 of the Department of Defense in order
 to reach objective judgments and carry
 out its constitutional mandate responsi-
 bly.
 Mr. Speaker, I support this bill to pro-
 vide additional funds for southeast Asia.
 I felt it was necessary, however, to com-
 ment today in some detail on the bill
 and I also respectfully call attention to
 the additional views contained in the
 report calling for improved fiscal pro-
 cedures.  It is my hope that the views
 expressed receive full consideration by
 the House.
 Mr. MAHON.  Mr. Chairman, I yield
 5 minutes to the gentleman from New
 York [Mr. CELLER].
 Mr.  CELLER. Mr.  Chairman  and
 members of the Committee, I am very
 happy,to note that there is genuine bi-
 partisan support for this appropriation
 measure. I, of course, support this bill.
 Joining 39 Governors, I support the
 President on Vietnam. The $13.1 billion
 fund is essential for the support of our
 troops and for carrying out our commit-
 ments in South Vietnam.
 The direction of policy in this conflict
 is far from easy. It bristles with serious
 and awesome problems.
 The President must make the final de-
 cisions. He has his intimate advisers, yet
 he is like a lonely man atop a mountain.
 Many are his sleepless nights, espe-
 cially when he reads the tragic dis-
 patches. At times he is veritably torn
 asunder with doubts and fears.  But
 courage and stamina are not lacking.
 He knows that patience is bitter but
 bears rich fruit.
 Like all who are responsible and dedi-
 cated, he is not insensible to criticism.
 He welcomes it when it is not mordant
 or abusive. Some of his frenetic critics
 seem more interested in crushing him
 than in our triumph against aggression
 in South Vietnam.

 belt. Some are mere billingsgate. With
 the monotony of a drumbeat we hear
 some of these armchair strategists and
 "pinafore" admirals saying what should
 be done. Ofttimes they speak in pique
 and spite. For them whatever the Presi-
 dent does is wrong.
 Some ranted that he should have gone
 to the United Nations. Although he was
 told by his trusted advisers that such
 action would be futile, he nonetheless
 made the trek to the United Nations.
 When he did that the same detractors
 railed that such a move was ridiculous
 and bound to fail.
 These same carping critics ridiculed
 his efforts at peace and said he sought
 peace only halfheartedly. "Let him ap-
 peal to the Pope at Rome."  He did.
 When his Holiness offered all in his
 power and did not succeed in budging
 Hanoi or Peiping, these same habitual
 faultfinders said, "I told you so."
 President Johnson made direct ap-
 peals to 19 nonalined nations with a
 view to having them persuade Hanoi
 and Peiping to the conference table.
 These nations did, but were rebuffed.
 The President sought particularly In-
 dia's intercession.  The rulers of Hanoi
 and Peiping again showed their fangs.
 The President, you may remember,
 was savagely condemned for continued
 bombing of the north.  He ordered the
 bombing stopped. The cessation yielded
 serious military disadvantage to us. The
 President received no credit for his ef-
 forts.  The Vietcong were brought no
 nearer to the conference table.
 The President requested Soviet Russia
 to arrange another Geneva-like confer-
 ence.  Russia demurred.  Ho Chi Minh
 and Mao Tse-tung just turn their faces
 away from all who bring the olive
 branch of peace.  Only yesterday, our
 offer of friendship, conveyed by Vice
 President  HUMPHREY,  was branded as
 the "kiss of Judas."
 Yet, the incessant defamers of the
 President continue to vent their spleen
 against him. Never do they utter a good
 word for anything he may do. They dip
 their pens in venom or gargle with gall,
 and write or speak "grapes of wrath."
 They refuse to realize the results of
 their incautious remarks, fail to under-
 stand that they create the false impres-
 sion abroad, that our Nation does not
 support the President.  Nothing is fur-
 ther from the truth.
 I raise my voice in clarion tones to
 defend and applaud my President, and
 at the same time support this appropri-
 ation bill.
 Mr. HAYS.  Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?

 Mr. MAHON.  Mr. Chairman, I yield
 15  minutes to the gentleman from
 Florida, the chairman of the Subcom-
 mittee on Military Construction, who
 conducted some of the hearings on this
 bill.
 (Mr. SIKES asked and was given per-
 mission to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. SIKES.  Mr. Chairman, let me
 stress the fact that the Committee on
 Appropriations has been ready to bring
 this bill to the floor for several weeks.
 Under the able direction of the distin-
 guished gentleman from Texas, hearings
 were initiated immediately after the re-
 quest for funds for the Vietnam war was
 received. There is no disposition to with-
 hold any funds which are needed to in-
 sure victory.  And ours is a bipartisan ef-
 fort.  This is in some measure a guess.
 But it is the best estimate which is avail-
 able. We have to trust someone. We are
 placing our trust in the recommenda-
 tions of the Nation's military leaders.
 Now the gentleman from Texas has
 spoken at length about the state of readi-
 ness of our military forces when the con-
 frontation began and it is in fact a
 remarkable and commendable situation.
 But let us not disregard the continued
 efforts of district leaders in the Congress
 like the gentleman from Texas and many
 others to make this situation true.
 I regret to state to the membership
 that those who attempt to read the hear-
 ings, will find them in considerable part
 useless.  The testimony has been so
 heavily censored, much of it incompre-
 hensible. Some of this is ridiculous. It
 serves only to confuse the Congress and
 the American people. Some of the cen-
 sored material has subsequently been
 released in uncensored form by other
 committees, or even by Pentagon officials.
 This makes a mockery of the efforts of
 this committee to cooperate on security
 matters.
 Now let us talk about the bill. I shall
 confine myself primarily to the con-
 struction problem on which separate
 hearings were held. As the House knows,
 the logistics problem in the Southeast
 Pacific is unbelievably large.  Logistics
 is and has been the limiting factor. We
 are supplying large forces, 12,000 miles
 away from home, halfway around the
 world.
 Last fall the U.S. forces were built up
 to more than 200,000.  This was neces-
 sary to stem the tide of victory which was
 rolling for Communist forces.  They
 nearly won the war before we realized
 and acted on the threat.
 But it was also thought that we were
 putting enough forces into Vietnam to
 permit government forces to win. We
 underestimated   enemy capabilities.
 They were building up too
 To win a war you must be prepared
 to deny territory to the enemy.  The
 victorious sweep of United States and
 Vietnamese forces into enemy held coun-
 tryside are in most instances, followed
 by withdrawal to secure areas, and the
 Communists roll right back as we leave.
 To insure the defeat of expanding
 enemy forces and to secure and hold ter-
 ritory now in Communist hands, we must
 have additional forces in Vietnam.  We
 are now in the process of doubling their
 number.
 That means doubling the logistics
 problem.  We need port facilities, air-
 fields, encampments, storage facilities.
 In December, when I saw the area work
 on some of the facilities then needed for
 200,000 men, had not begun. On others,
 the percentage of completion was ex-
 tremely small. The overall job is running
 a year behind schedule. This is not the
 fault of the construction team.  They
 are  doing  an  outstanding  job. The
 enormity of their task is the main prob-
 lem and it is staggering in scope.                                                                                              Let us
 not take away credit for the work which
 has been done.
 The construction of essential opera-
 tional, logistical, and support facilities
 are a pacing factor in the deployment
 of allied forces and the conduct of mili-
 tary operations in southeast Asia.  The
 nature of the terrain, the paucity of
 operational bases and the lack of national
 ports and other supply and logistical
 facilities in that area have resulted in a
 major construction effort if we are to
 adequately support our military require-
 ments.  In addition, backup and train-
 ing requirements have generated other
 urgent construction needs in other areas
 of the Pacific and in the United States..
 The amount of $417,700,000 has been
 made available to date in support of
 this program.  Additional funds in the
 total amount of $1,238,400,000 are rec-
 ommended in the accompanying bill.
 This brings the total to date to $1,656,-
 100,000 for construction.

 In the past, there has been a serious
 lack of central authority and coordina-
 tion in the construction efforts.                  Effec-
 tive coordination between the construc-
 tion and operational programs has been
 limited.  The recent establishment of a
 general officer position on the staff of
 the Military Advisory Command in Viet-
 nam  to                effectuate  this  coordination
 should assist in overcoming the problem.
 Bttt vigorous efforts still must be made
 to properly coordinate the construction
 effort and make it fully responsive to
 operational requirements.
 An essential portion of the construc-
 tion problem is the lack of sufficient
 skilled labor forces in South Vietnam to
 meet the military construction effort
 which is needed. The present contractor
 effort is requiring all of the available
 local labor force plus generating a re-
 quirement for the use of foreign labor
 which naturally adds to the cost.  The
 construction battalions of the Navy and
 the Army are doing heroic work in their
 activities there.  Theirs is one of the
 outstanding contributions.  If the es-
 calated construction program is to be
 successfully implemented, there is a need
 for more troop construction battalions
 from both the Navy and the Army. The
 requirement for these troops will be ac-
 centuated as additional facilities become
 operational and it becomes necessary to
 maintain them with troop labor.  In
 order to meet the overall requirement
 for the construction and maintenance of
 facilities, steps now are being taken to
 double the troop construction units in
 South Vietnam.  However, this is not
 enough.  Through the use of only a part
 of the Reserve Engineer Construction
 Battalions and Navy Seabee Battalions-
 for which equipment is available-the'
 number of these forces in the southeast
 Pacific can be doubled again. To do this
 would save lives and time and money.
 This is one of the most important steps
 which could be taken, but there are no
 indications it is going to be done.
 Now, this is a costly program.  This
 is not the end of it.
 It is no time to get careless on costs,
 and there always is the temptation to do
 so when money is readily available in
 unlimited amounts from Congress.  It
 is the attitude of Congress that Ameri-
 ca's fighting men must have whatever
 they need to fight a war.  But this is
 not an invitation for the Pentagon, to
 spend recklessly or wastefully. I am very
 much afraid that time will reveal that
 oes
 turer for $47,000 each.  The Army
 not even seek to take full advantage of an
 option to buy additional helicopters at
 the contract price of $19,000.  A compet-
 ing firm with a helicopter which is essen-
 tially the same recently offered to pro-
 vide heliCO tern at $29 800 each   I am
 convinced that today there are is a num-
 ber of firms which would welcome an op-
 portunity to provide helicopters at a fig-
 ure much lower than $47,000.  This is
 an inexcusable situation.  Here is a
 place where heads should roll.  And
 there may well be other instances. The
 Pentagon should launch its own investi-
 gations to determine that the specter of
 waste and careless purchasing does not
 belie the sacrifices of those who serve on
 the fighting front.  I can tell you that
 this committee, through its chairman,
 has notified the Pentagon of our strong
 concern about the case in point.
 The Committee still is deeply con-
 cerned that the programed expanded
 labor force and improved construction
 capability will be insufficient to meet the
 construction requirements.  Continuing
 effort must be made to provide the con-
 struction capability in South Vietnam
 necessary to support operational and lo-
 gistical requirements.  To do less would
 seriously jeopardize the efforts our mili-
 tary forces are making to achieve the
 victory and peace desired by this Nation.
 There also is a tendency to utilize
 peacetime  financial and  programing
 procedures in the military construction
 program in South Vietnam. Steps have
 recently been taken to broaden these
 procedures so as to provide additional
 flexibility in the program. The Commit-
 tee is concerned that these changes
 might not be sufficient to meet the re-
 quirements for the proper implementa-
 tion of the program. It will be expected
 that the Department of Defense will con-
 tinually examine this phase of the pro-
 gram to insure that the necessary flexi-
 bility is provided within the overall con-
 struction program to meet changing tac-
 tical and logistical requirements and to
 provide a responsive and progressive
 program.
 There has been a turn for the better
 in the fighting in Vietnam. The Saigon
 government shows more stability than at
 any time since the Diem regime. There
 is now recognition of the necessity to
 face up to the problem of winning over
 the people of the villages and hamlets-
 many of whom have been Communist-
 dominated for years.
 These things may well give rise to a
 feeling at home that the problem of
 Vietnam has essentially been solved-
 that victory is near. This would be dan-
 gerous thinking indeed.  The biggest
 casualty lists of the war are coming in
 now.  We have far to go.  We must
 never forget we are in a war-a dirty,
 dangerous war which soon will involve
 5557
 nearly half a million American fighting
 men. They must have the solid backing
 of the American people and the Congress.
 It also is a time for soul searching
 efforts in the Pentagon to insure that the
 right decisions are being made.  There is
 no time to hold back the forces or the
 methods which can help to insure an
 early victory.

 The Committee resumed its sitting.

 remaining.
 Mr. BOW.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 15
 minutes to the gentleman from Wiscon-
 sin [Mr. LAIRD].
 Mr. LAIRD. Mr. Chairman, I rise in
 support of the defense appropriation
 subcommittee report  on  this  supple-
 mental appropriation for the fiscal year
 1966 in the amount of $13.1 billion.
 The support of those of us on the mi-
 nority side of ' the Committee on Appro-
 priations for this bill is predicated on the
 necessity and the awareness that these
 funds must be provided in order to back
 up our fighting men in Vietnam.
 I would like to point out to the Mem-
 bers of the House, Mr. Chairman, that
 this is not the last supplemental appro-
 priation that we will be considering for
 the Department of Defense for the fiscal
 year 1966.  Submitted to the Congress
 under a transmittal that came up here
 entitled District of Columbia supple-
 mental appropriations for 1966, just the
 other day, there is contained almost an-
 other billion dollars in appropriation
 requests for the Department of Defense
 for fiscal year 1966 to handle military
 pay alone.

 5558                      CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE          March 15, 1966
 tion bill for 1966 was before the Congress
 pointed out that no funds were included
 in the 1966 budget statement last Jan-
 uary to cover the cost of escalating the
 war in Vietnam.
 I would like to say today that although
 this supplemental is before us today, this
 coupled with the 1967 budget for the
 Department of Defense will not finance
 current plans and contingencies for the
 fighting in Vietnam through the remain-
 ing portion of the fiscal year 1966 and
 the fiscal year 1967.
 As the chairman of our committee so
 ably said, this supplemental has to be
 considered along with the 196'7 budget
 for the Department of Defense. It should
 be pointed out here on the floor of the
 House today that the 1967 budget was
 out of date 2 days after it was submitted
 to this Congress.  It was out of date
 because the manpower ceiling so far as
 the Department of the Army is concerned
 was removed 2 days after the budget
 __was submitted to the Congress by the
 President of the United States.
 Those of us working with the Depart-
 ment of Defense budgets know full well
 that additional funds will be needed in
 1966 as well as in 1967 in order to finance
 the commitment of the United States
 not only in Vietnam, but to maintain our
 present worldwide commitments sup-
 ported by this administration which were
 so ably set forth by the Secretary of
 State in his appearance before the For-
 eign Relations Committee of the U.S.
 Senate just 10 days ago.
 Mr. Chairman, on March 4, 196?, the
 Department of State issued through the
 office of its legal adviser an important
 document entitled, "The Legality of U.S.
 Participation in the Defense of Viet-
 nam."
 The document was prepared to com-
 bat the persistent criticism from certain
 Democratic Members of the Congress
 that this Nation is acting illegally in
 using American military power in Viet-
 nam.
 With the major thesis of this docu-
 ment, I have no quarrel.  A compelling
 case for the right of the United States
 under international law to use its mili-
 tary forces to assist in the defense of
 South Vietnam against aggression can
 certainly be made.
 I am grieved, however, to find that
 the State Department chose to distort
 history in this publication when it came
 to explain the commitments which have
 resulted in the involvment of the United
 States in the war in Vietnam.  The dis-
 tortion is of two kinds. First, the docu-
 ment ignores completely some highly
 relevant facts.  Second, it misleads by
 failing to analyze fully the declarations
 which it cites, sometimes conveying
 thereby a false impression of their
 import.
 In summary, this document argues
 that the present military involvement
 of the Nation in Vietnam was made
 necessary by pledges made by President
 Eisenhower and President Kennedy.  It
 does not cite a single utterance by Presi-
 dent Johnson.  It suggests that the pre-
 sent administration had nothing at all
 to do with any commitment to Vietnam.
 This document contains a section of
 6 pages headed, "The United States Has
 Undertaken  Commitments  To  Assist
 South  Vietnam  in Defending Itself
 Against Communist Aggression from the
 North."  The evidence which it then
 presents to prove the existence of the
 commitment of the Eisenhower admin-
 istration is the following: the statements
 of President Eisenhower at the end of
 the Geneva Conference of 1954, the
 SEATO treaty, the assistance given by
 the United States to South Vietnam after
 the Geneva Conference, and a joint com-
 munique issued by Eisenhower and Diem
 on May 11, 1957.  This is followed by a
 citation of two statements made by
 President Kennedy on August 2, 1961,
 and December 14, 1961.
 Then, abruptly, the State Depart-
 ment's history of the commitment of the
 United States to South Vietnam ends.
 Equally strange is the section of this
 document captioned, "Actions by the
 United States and South Vietnam Are
 Justified Under the Geneva Accords of
 1954." The actions of the United States
 which are described in this section are
 the supply of "considerable military
 equipment and supplies from the United
 States prior to late 1961" and the estab-
 lishment of an American Military Assist-
 ance Advisory Group of "slightly less
 than 900 men" in Saigon.  Further the
 document relates:
 The United States found it necessary in
 late 1961 to increase substantially the num-
 bers  of  our  military  personnel                                                    and  the
 amounts and kinds of equipment intro-
 duced * * * into South Vietnam.
 And there, abruptly, the State Depart-
 ment ends its account of the military
 action of the United States in South
 Vietnam.
 If some future catastrophe were to de-
 stroy every written record of the rela-
 tions of the United States and Vietnam
 during the 1950's and 1960's except the
 State Department's publication, "The
 Legality of United States Participation
 in the Defense of Vietnam," the historian
 who tried to reconstruct the facts from
 this document would write something like
 this:
 Two Presidents of the United States-
 Presidents  Eisenhower  and  Kennedy-in-
 volved their Nation in a war to defend South
 Vietnam against aggression from North Viet-
 nam.                                                    Their pledges of support to South
 Vietnam led to the sending of military sup-
 plies, to the dispatch of 900 military advis-
 ers, and in 1961 to the commitment of sub-
 stantial numbers of American troops.
 This conflict may have been going on in
 Vietnam as late as 1966 under another Presi-
 dent of the United States whose name is
 not recorded.  in that year the Department
 of State issued a document upholding the
 legality of the actions of Presidents Eisen-
 hower and Kennedy.
 Mr. Chairman, this manipulation of
 history should give us all deep concern.
 When our Department of State releases
 a report of this kind, I fear we are closer
 to 1984 than the calendar indicates. This
 is the kind of propaganda that makes it
 difficult for the administration to estab-
 lish its credibility. This is playing poli-
 tics with Vietnam.
 NO  COMMITMENT  OF  COMBAT  TROOPS  UNDER
 EISENHOWER
 If the State Department document of
 March 4 were the only instance of dis-
 tortion of history on the part of the
 administration in explaining why Amer-
 ican troops are fighting in Vietnam, it
 might be forgotten. But time after time,
 administration spokesmen, including the
 President, have sought to make it appear-
 that the steps taken since November of
 1963 were forced upon it by commitments
 of earlier administrations.
 President Johnson, for example, said
 on August 3, 1965:
 Today the most difficult problem that con-
 fronts your President is how to keep an
 agreement that I did not initiate-I Inherited
 it-but an agreement to help a small nation
 remain independent, free of aggression-the
 nation of South Vietnam.
 Earlier the President and others in his
 administration were in the habit of cit-
 ing a letter written by President Eisen-
 hower to Diem on October 1, 1954, as "the
 commitment."  This letter was nothing
 more than an expression of willingness
 to discuss ways and means of aiding Viet-
 nam if the Diem regime made certain re-
 forms.
 More recently, the administration has
 been using the SEATO treaty of 1954 as
 the source of the commitment.
 This treaty was not a commitment to
 send American troops to fight in south-
 east Asia. It carefully avoided the kind
 of automatic response to aggression em-
 bodied in the NATO agreement, sum-
 marized in the principle, "An attack up,
 on one is an attack upon all."
 Section 1 of article IV of the SEATO
 agreement reads:
 1. Each party recognizes that aggression
 by means of armed attack in the treaty area
 against any of the parties or against any
 state  or  territory  which  the  parties  by
 unanimous agreement may hereafter desig-
 nate, would endanger its own peace and
 safety, and agrees that it will in that event
 act to meet the common danger in accord-
 ance with its constitutional processes.                                                                                                 Meas-
 ures taken under this paragraph shall be
 immediately reported to the Security Coun-
 cil of the United Nations.
 Secretary Dulles, testifying before the
 Senate Foreign Relations Committee on
 the SEATO treaty, declared:
 The agreement of each of the parties to
 act to meet the common danger in accord-
 ance with its constitutional processes leaves
 to the judgment of each country the type of
 action to be taken in the event an armed
 attack occurs.
 Further, Mr. Dulles said:
 The treaty does not attempt to get into
 the difficult question as to precisely how we
 act.
 On the floor of the Senate in the de-
 bate on ratification of the SEATO agree-
 ment, on February 1, 1955, Senator
 Smith, of New Jersey, clearly explained
 the nature of the commitment in these
 words:
 Some of the participants came to Manila
 with the intention of establishing an orga-
 nization modeled on the lines of the North
 Atlantic Treaty arrangements.  That would
 have been a compulsory arrangement for our
 military participation in case of any attack.
 Such an organization might have required

 the commitment of American ground forces
 to the Asian mainland, We carefully avoided
 any possible implication regarding an ar-
 rangement of that kind.
 We have no purpose of following any such
 policy as that of having our forces involved
 in a ground war.
 Under this treaty, each party recognizes
 that an armed attack on any country within
 the treaty area would endanger its own peace
 and safety.  Each party, therefore, agrees to
 act to meet the common danger in accord-
 ance with its constitutional processes.  That
 means,  by  implication,  that  if  any such
 emergency as is contemplated by the treaty
 should arise in that area it will be brought
 before the Congress by the President and
 the administration, and will be considered
 under our constitutional processes.  We are
 not committed to the principle of NATO,
 namely, that an attack on one is an attack
 on all, calling for immediate military action
 without further consideration by Congress.
 For ourselves, the arrangement means that
 we will have avoided the impracticable over-
 commitment which would have been in-
 volved if we attempted to place American
 ground forces around the perimeter of the
 area of potential Chinese ingress into south-
 east Asia.  Nothing in this treaty calls for
 the use of American ground forces in that
 fashion.
 The speaker, Senator H. Alexander
 Smith, was a member of the U.S. delega-
 tion to the Manila Conference and a
 signer of the SEATO agreement,
 One academic authority, W. McMahon
 Ball, has written:
 The treaty does not oblige the United
 States either legally or morally to take any
 course in southeast Asia than the course it
 might be expected to take if the treaty did
 not exist.
 Article IV of the Southeast Asia Col-
 lective Defense Treaty clearly reserves
 to each signatory the right to determine
 the nature of its response to armed ag-
 gression and does not commit in advance
 any signatory to use its armed forces to
 deal with the aggressor.
 Recognizing this fact, the Kennedy ad-
 ministration did not use American forces
 to repel Communist aggression in Laos.
 The legal commitment of the United
 States to South Vietnam is the same as
 Its commitment to Laos. Both of these
 countries of southeast Asia were brought
 under the protection of SEATO.
 Lyndon Johnson as Vice President
 made it clear in 1961 that the United
 States had not up to that time com-
 mitted itself to an obligation that would
 require employment of its military forces.
 In a memorandum to President Kennedy
 dated May 23, 1961, right after his return
 from a tour of Asia, Johnson wrote:
 The fundamental decision required of the
 United States-and time is of the greatest
 importance-is whether we are to attempt
 to meet the challenge of Communist ex-
 pansion now in southeast Asia by a major
 effort in support of the forces of freedom in
 the area or throw in the towel.  This deci-
 sion must be made in a fuil realization of
 the very heavy and continuing costs in-
 volved in terms of money, of effort, and of
 U.S. prestige.  It must be made with the
 knowledge that at some point we may be
 faced with a further decision of whether we
 commit major U.S. forces to the area or cut
 our losses and withdraw should our efforts
 fail.  We must remain master of this deci-
 Finally, Gen. Maxwell Taylor in testi-
 mony before the Senate Foreign Rela-
 tions Committee on February 17, 1966,
 demolished the argument that there was
 any commitment to employ American
 troops in combat under the Eisenhower
 administration in the following exchange
 with Senator BOURKE HICKENLOOPER Of
 Iowa:         ,
 Senator HICKENLOOPER. Now, up until the
 end of the Eisenhower administration, we
 had only about 750 military personnel in
 South Vietnam, did we not?
 General TAYLOR. It was very small, some-
 thing like that.
 Senator  HICKENLOOPER. I  think  that  is
 within 25 or 30 of the number, either way,
 and they were entirely devoted to giving tech-
 nical advice on training to the South Viet-
 namese troops.
 General TAYLOR. That is correct.
 Senator  HICKENLOOPER. To  your  knowl-
 edge, did we have any commitment or agree-
 ment with the South Vietnamese up to that
 time that we would put in active field mill-
 tary forces to conduct a war along with
 them?
 General TAYLOR. No, sir.  Very clearly we
 made no such commitment.  We didn't want
 such a commitment.  This was the last thing
 we had in mind.
 Senator   HICKENLOOPER. When   was  the
 commitment made for us to actively partici-
 pate in the military operations of the war
 as American personnel?
 General TAYLOR. We, insofar as the use of
 our combat ground forces'are concerned, that
 took place, of course, only in the spring of
 1965.
 In the air, we had been participating more
 actively over 2 or 3 years.
 When President Eisenhower left the
 White House, there were no American
 troops in South Vietnam.  There were
 only approximately 700 military advisers.
 When President Eisenhower left the
 White House, there was no commitment
 to  send  American  troops  to  South
 Vietnam.
 Under President Kennedy, the first
 American combat casualties occurred in
 December  1961.   Although  President
 Kennedy increased the number of U.S.
 military personnel in Vietnam to 17,000,
 the American forces were there pri-
 marily to advise, not to fight.
 The New York Times of August 19,
 1965, correctly stated the case when it
 said:
 The shift from  military assistance and
 combat advice to direct participation by
 American combat troops in the Vietnamese
 war has * * * been a unilateral American
 decision * * * by President Johnson.
 THE HONOLULU COMMITMENT
 I find it unbelievable that a State De-
 partment document dated March 4, 1966,
 purporting to explain the commitment of
 this Nation in South Vietnam could avoid
 mention of the Honolulu declaration of
 February 8, 1966.  For part IV of that
 declaration is entitled "The Common
 Commitment."  It reads:
 The President of the United States and
 the Chief of State and Prime Minister of the
 Republic of Vietnam are thus pledged again
 to defense against aggression, to the work
 of social revolution, to the goal of free self-
 government, to the attack on hunger, igno-
 rance, and disease, and to the unending quest
 5559
 These are important and weighty com-
 mitments.  Yet they go unreported in
 the State Department's survey of the
 commitment of the Government of the
 United States to South Vietnam.
 Mr. Chairman, I do not mean here to be
 critical of the actions of the President
 with relation to Vietnam.  I simply
 plead that, when the administration
 undertakes to defend itself against critics
 in the President's party, it present the
 facts and all the facts.  Let the admin-
 istration acknowledge is decisions as its
 own and justify its actions on their
 merits.
 Mr. MAHON.  Mr. Chairman, I yield
 myself 2 minutes.
 Mr. Chairman, the able gentleman
 from Wisconsin [Mr. LAIRD] has made
 reference to the historical background
 of the war in Vietnam.
 I believe that if a look backward re-
 veals anything it reveals our difficulties
 in South Vietnam have been nonparti-
 san in nature.  The actions which this
 .country has taken have been actions
 taken in defense of the security of the
 United States and have not been moti-
 vated in my opinion by political con-
 siderations.
 The war by the Vietnamese against the
 French began in 1946.  In 1950 we began
 to give some assistance to the French in
 an effort to try to conclude successfully
 this war.  The French finally capitu-
 lated.  We began to provide aid to the
 South Vietnamese against aggression in
 Vietnam in 1950.  In 1954 or 1955 we
 began to provide foreign aid, direct mili-
 tary and economic, to the people in Viet-
 nam who were fighting for freedom.
 Mr. Chairman, during this time a num-
 ber of negotiations took place.  Mr. Dul-
 les was very instrumental as Secretary
 of  State  in  negotiating  the SEATO
 treaty.  In this treaty, to which we sub-
 scribe, the United States undertook an
 international obligation to help defend
 South Vietnam against aggression.
 The treaty said:
 Each party recognizes that aggression by
 means of armed attack in the treaty area
 against any of the parties or against any
 state or territory which the parties by unan-
 imous  agreement  might  hereafter  desig-
 nate,  would endanger its own peace    and
 safety, and agrees that it will in that event
 act to meet the common danger in accord-
 ance with constitutional processes-
 And so forth.
 The CHAIRMAN.  The time of the
 gentleman from Texas has expired.
 Mr. MAHON.  Mr. Chairman, I yield
 myself 2 additional minutes.
 So, Mr. Chairman, we recognized early
 that the security and well-being of the
 United States was heavily involved in
 southeast Asia.
 Mr. LAIRD.  Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield on that point in the
 treaty?
 Mr. MAHON. I yield to the gentleman
 from Wisconsin.
 Mr. LAIRD.  I would like to discuss
 that point.
 Mr. MAHON.  I do not want to dis-
 cuss it in detail, but I want to briefly re-
 fer to the history of this situation in

 maintenance of the status quo. Here is
 a )lttle 100th-rated power, North Viet-
 nam, pulling the biggest power in the
 world around by the nose day after day.
 It leads me, as an individual, to feel that
 the Vietcong may be winning as long as
 they can maintain the status quo and
 actually feel that they are. This we must
 stop and the first start, to me, appears
 to be to stop the inflow of materiel to our
 enemy.
 We will supply this money. We argue
 about financial budgets.  We want to
 keep waste down. We want to be econ-
 omy minded in handling appropriations.
 But in World War II I well remember
 that when war materiel was sent to for-
 ward theaters, it was marked off then and
 there.  That is not the major problem
 that we have. We are reconciled to the
 fact that these funds will be spent.
 We are in an engagement at the end
 of a 10,000-mile supply line, with our
 troops  slugging  it  out,  fighting  in
 swamps, attacked by mosquitoes and suf-
 fering from malaria; fighting under the
 most trying conditions where it seems
 we do not know who our friends are, but
 where our leaders feel we must remain
 to show that we will be in southeast Asia.
 Speaking ,for myself alone, if we are
 to keep our young men there-and our
 leaders and our country feel not only a
 commitment but a present necessity to
 keep our forces there-we owe it to them
 to do those things that would cut off

 financing the projection of contracts to
 supply material that it is apparent they
 are going to need.
 There are two or three other things
 we might say.  If we need a base in
 southeast Asia, might not we have the
 courage to say so and supply a base as
 against saying that we are trying to let
 people follow the path of their own de-
 termination, with all the mixed-up in-
 formation that we can get on that
 subject?
 I wish to say again that I am for this
 country, and I know the Members of the
 Congress are, too.  I do feel an obliga-
 tion, having questioned the Secretary of
 Defense and various others, and I shall
 put those questions and answers, where
 they exist, in the RECORD, to question
 present actions or lack of determination
 to put up.
 I feel we have an obligation to question
 a war in which we are engaged as the
 result of a foreign policy participated in
 by both parties.  As we do that, we do
 not have to be hawks or doves.  We are
 in a quagmire, and we need to get out of
 it.  It is not for me to say or for you to
 say, but it is for all of us to insist that
 we take appropriate action, as long as we
 are in it, to back the men who are there,
 to determine what we must have for
 them and take action to see that an un-
 tenable situation does not simply go on
 and on, with resulting loss of life.
 If our friends In other parts of the
 world will not stand by us, it is better to
 find out such fact.  To support my

 Secretary MCNAMARA. I fully support that
 conclusion, Mr. Whitten.
 Mr. WHITTEN. You were before us last year
 in connection with the regular defense bill
 and again on several supplementals, and De-
 fense Department witnesses have been before
 us numerous times when we have approved
 a reprograming request.  If you had foreseen
 the need of the money you are asking for
 now, you would have asked for it, would you
 not?
 Secretary MCNAMARA. Yes.  I stated to the
 committee in August that we foresaw the
 need for additional funds but for a number
 of reasons were not requesting them:  (1)
 we could not predict our needs with cer-
 tainty, (2) we knew that it would be possible
 to return in January with a better estimate
 of those needs, and (3) we felt that the funds
 which would be available to us in the original
 fiscal  year  1966  budget  and  the  August
 amendment would carry us through the early
 part of this calendar year.
 Mr. WHITTEN. The point I make is that the
 defense effort has not suffered from lack of
 funds either on your part or on the part of
 Congress.
 Secretary McNAMARA. I fully support that
 conclusion.
 EFFECTS OF BOMBING ON NORTH VIETNAM
 Mr. WHITTEN. Now carrying it one step
 further,  General Wheeler, I am trying to
 make clear in my mind, as I understood you
 in enumerating the targets in North Viet-
 nam, that in effect you indicated that insofar
 as the present military effort Is concerned,
 where we are having this guerrilla-type war-
 far, they were what might be termed sec-
 ondary targets, in that none of them are
 sufficiently vital as to cripple the Vietcong
 in their efforts against South Vietnam, is
 that correct?
 General WHEELER. That is essentially cor-
 rect, Mr. WHITTEN.  I pointed out the other
 day when I ran over the entire target sys-
 tem-I believe in response to a question from
 Mr. SINES-that when we talk of industrial
 targets in North Vietnam, we are really talk-
 ing about something that essentially does not
 exist.
 Even so at the levels of conflict in South
 Vietnam, and with the number of Vietcong
 and PAVN troops that must be supported,
 we cannot completely cut off the introduc-
 tion of supplies.  We can hurt them.  We
 can make it cost them more.  We cannot cut
 off the flow of supplies completely.
 Mr.  WHITTEN. As I understood it either
 you or the Secretary said, that while there
 are some changes as a result of the lull in
 bombing, really it was not as significant as
 we might think.  That, notwithstanding our
 bombing, due to the fact it is guerrilla war-
 fare they could supply the troops they had
 even by human beings on trails.  As long as
 that was true the bombing was not-in line
 with what you just said-sufficient to strangle
 their supply system.  In other words, their
 capability of supplying so far exceeds the
 actual need for the present operation that
 they would probably have that much if we
 had kept up bombing.  Am I recalling it ap-
 proximately correct?
 General WHEELER. I think Mr. McNamara
 said the greater part of the statement you
 made, Mr. WHITTEN.
 Mr. WHITTEN. I am asking this to clarify it
 if my recollection is not correct.
 General WHEELER. (Off the record.)
 Mr. WHITTEN. Is the chief value of bomb-
 ing to prevent an enlargment of the Vietcong
 operation as of now?
 General WHEELER. (Off the record.)
 Mr. WHITTEN. I am not trying to play on
 words but if I could reduce it to this      it
 Is very important to keep them from supply-
 ing a much larger force.
 General WHEELER. That is my judgment,
 Mr. Whitten.

 we stopped this bombing because we were
 short of bombs?
 Secretary McNAMARA.  Absolutely none.  I
 will give you the bomb inventories.
 (The Information requested is classified
 and was furnished to the committee.)
 SUPPLY SHORTAGES
 Mr. WHITTEN.                                 Or other supplies?
 Secretary MCNAMARA.  Absolutely none.
 General WHEELER.  May I add something
 to that?
 Mr. WHITTEN. I asked the question so you
 can get the answer in the record.
 Secretary MCNAMARA. I appreciate that.
 General WHEELER. I would like to make
 a comment, if I might, because,I think it is
 pertinent.                 -
 I spent 5 days during the Christmas sea-
 son visiting Vietnam.  I visited Army, Navy,
 Air Force, and Marine units both in Vietnam
 and in Thailand, and I also visited one of the
 carriers, staying overnight.
 I asked every responsible commander that
 I saw-and I saw a great many of them
 down to battalion level-if their operations
 had been hampered by shortages or defici-
 encies in consumables.  I am talking about
 ammunition, POL, et cetera.   The answer
 invariably was no, that they had been able
 to carry out their combat operations.
 Secretary MCNAMARA. May I make a fur-
 ther  comment,  Mr.  WHITTEN,                                                                                                                                     in order to
 throw light on this subject?  I Issued an
 order to the commanders       .  So every
 bomb that we would have consumed had we
 continued to bomb North Vietnam has been
 consumed.  It is our estimate or it was our
 plan, I should say, that during the month
 of January we would drop 150,000 bombs
 That plan was not limited in the slightest
 degree by bomb shortages.
 Mr. SIKES. May I ask one very brief ques-
 tion?  I asked the same question of many
 field commanders and in each instance I was
 told that there was no essential operation

 Secretary MCNAMARA. Mr. WHITTEN, I have
 seen no evidence of such a feeling on the part
 of any foreign power or in the foreign press.
 Mr. WHITTEN. I do not want to cut you off
 but let me ask you one thing that you might
 reply to.  Is that possibly one of the reasons
 that they have refused to take advantage of
 our lull in bombing and come to the peace
 table.  Could that be one of the reasons?
 Secretary MCNAMARA. No sir, it could not
 be one of the reasons.
 Mr. WHITTEN. Why do you say it so flatly?
 Secretary MCNAMARA. Because we do have
 indications of the kinds of information get-
 ting through to them and the kind of infor-
 mation that influences their actions.  I have
 seen no evidence that the elimination of sur-
 plus and obsolete military bases-at a time
 when we are rapidly expanding our budget
 by announcing a supplemental of $12.3 bil-
 lion to the existing budget-has, in any way
 influenced them.
 Mr. WHITTEN. Couldn't they take it that
 we are now waking up and rectifying a
 mistake?
 Secretary  MCNAMARA, Are  you  speaking
 about the base reduction program as rectify-
 ing a mistake?
 Mr. WHITTEN. And planes, et cetera.
 Secretary MCNAMARA. I do not see how it
 would be possible for them to interpret clos-
 ing obsolete bases as rectifying a mistake.
 In any event, I can tell you, Mr. WHITTEN,
 that no expert that I have talked to has ever
 even raised this point much less put any
 weight on it.  As a matter of fact, I had one
 brought over here from London just last
 week to discuss with me the reaction of the
 North Vietnamese.
 PREVIOUS JUDGEMENTS ON VIETNAM
 Mr.      WHITTEN. Let  me  ask  two  or  three
 questions and then I shall pass the witness
 on, Mr. Chairman.      Last spring we saw no
 need for this supplemental.  I have in front
 of me your prior statements, Mr. Secretary.
 I would not want to read them to you.        I
 would not want mine read to me.  I know
 they were sincere and honest and based on
 the best information you had.  This has not
 worked out like you folks hoped it would
 and we had hoped it would.    Where have we
 miscalculated, in your opinion?
 Secretary MCNAMARA. There is an indirect
 reference, and I know you were very gentle
 even in the indirect reference. With respect
 to my prior statements-
 Mr. WHITTEN. Let me say this, that this
 committee has backed your judgment so we
 are in it, too.  I am just asking now with
 hindsight, where can you point your finger
 and figure that we miscalculated as a group,
 not just you?
 Secretary MCNAMARA. Mr. Chairman, be-
 cause of the reference to prior statements
 and in anticipation of such a reference, I
 went through my prior statements a few
 weeks ago, and I have extracted all the per-
 tinent parts relating-
 Mr. WHITTEN. That is all right.  Where
 would you say we miscalculated? That is
 my question. Don't get away from my ques-
 tion.
 Secretary MCNAMARA. I will come to the
 question.  But the question carries an im-
 plied                 reference  to  prior  statements,  Mr.
 Chairman.  Therefore, I would ask the per-
 mission of the committee to introduce into
 the record my previous statements on the
 war in Vietnam. There are 59 of them.
 Mr. WHITTEN. I have no objection to that.
 Mr. MAI ON. Yes.  They will be included at
 this point.
 (NOTE.-This information appears in vol.
 I, pp. 57 to 87 of the hearings.)
 Mr. WHITTEN. I am making no condemna-
 tion for prior opinion.
 Secretary MCNAMARA. I understand.  I ap-
 preciate that your reference was gentle.  Mr.
 Chairman, the question was, Where was it
 that we miscalculated?
 Mr. WHITTEN. In your opinion.
 Secretary MCNAMARA. I do not know if you
 should call it a miscalculation.  I think it is
 perfectly clear that the North Vietnamese
 have continued to increase their support of
 the Vietcong despite the increase in our effort
 and that of the South Vietnamese.  I say
 that I do not know whether or not this was
 a miscalculation.  If you go through these
 statements that I have just inserted in the
 record, or the statements of President Ken-
 nedy or those of President Johnson, you will
 find that they repeatedly refer to this point,
 namely, that the response required from us
 will depend to a considerable degree upon the
 action taken by the aggressor, in this case,
 the North Vietnamese.  We simply cannot
 predict their actions accurately.  We cannot,
 therefore, predict the amount of force that
 we will have to bring to bear in order to
 achieve our political objective.   What has
 happened is that the North Vietnamese have
 continually increased the amount of re-
 sources, men, and material that they have
 been willing to devote to their objective of
 subverting and destroying the political insti-
 tutions of South Vietnam.  Whether or not
 you describe the evolution of the situation in
 Vietnam as a miscalculation, I think is a
 question of semantics.
 Mr. WHITTEN. It has not turned out like we
 thought it would.  That is a homely way of
 putting it, but it has not turned out like
 we thought it would.  Where were we wrong
 in our thinking?   That is bringing it down
 to a level where we all can understand it.
 Secretary MCNAMARA. I think it was hoped
 that the South Vietnamese by their own
 efforts could contain the insurgency that the
 North Vietnamese has initiated inside South
 Vietnam.  Later, when it became very clear
 they couldn't, it became necessary for us to
 supply advisers and substantial amounts of
 equipment to improve their capability for
 containing the insurgency.  Even with this
 assistance they couldn't contain the Viet-
 cong, because the North Vietnamese were
 continuing to expand their program of send-
 ing men and material into the south.
 Mr. WHITTEN. Let me ask one other ques-
 tion.
 (Off the record).
 Secretary MCNAMARA, Let me go back be-
 cause I did not finish-
 Mr.  WHITTEN. What  is  the  plan  for
 winning?
 Secretary MCNAMARA. Let me go back to
 the previous question  because I did not
 finish my statement with respect to the
 changes that have occurred during the past
 several years which in turn, affected the
 amount of effort that we have had to put into
 the struggle.
 Mr. WHITTEN. Don't let us forget my ques-
 tion.
 Secretary MCNAMARA. I won't.  I want to
 answer one question at a time, however.
 I think that one event that significantly
 influenced the course of the conflict was the
 overthrow of Diem which was the result of
 many forces, most of them not within our
 control.  But the Diem overthrow, as much
 as anything else, affected the course of the
 conflict in the following year or two.
 This factor, plus the continuing increase
 in the amount of effort that North Vietnam
 applied to their objective caused a Continu-
 ing increase in the amount of force which we
 have had to apply in South Vietnam.
 Now your second question, How do we hope
 to win?
 Mr. WHITTEN. How do we plan to win?
 Secretary MCNAMARA. I am answering the
 question as it was phrased.
 PLAN FOR WINNING THE WAR
 Mr. WHITTEN. Let me change my question,
 What is our plan to win?
 . Secretary  MCNAMARA. All right,  what is
 our plan to win?  We plan with the help of
 the South Vietnamese to apply sufficient
 force against the Vietcong and the North
 Vietnamese military units in the south to
 5563
 prove to them that they cannot win in the
 south.   While doing so, we have applied
 bombing to the north to increase the cost
 of their operations in the south and to re-
 duce their capability for expanding their
 operations in the south.
 Mr. WIzrrrEN. Have we not already tried
 that and failed, Mr. Secretary?.
 Secretary MCNAMARA, No.  We have not
 failed, we have not lost.
 ECONOMIC COST OF THE WAR
 Mr. WHITTEN. We have not lost, but we
 certainly have not won.  I think you are do-
 ing as well as you can with what you have
 to do in the situation we are in, so I am not
 being critical-I have yet to find anybody
 who has a plan to win.   We cannot do it by
 bombing these targets in North Vietnam,  I
 do not know what the relative cost of the
 war per day in money is to us as compared
 to them.  I do know their standard of liv-
 ing.                                                                                                                                    They carry supplies on their backs.
 Human beings are almost unlimited in that
 area of the world.  I know it is way around
 the world from us.  Let me interrupt to ask,
 Have you any comparative dollar cost?
 Secretary MCNAMARA. No.
 Mr. WHITTEN. You do not figure war in
 money, but I am talking about the drain on
 your economy.  Could you give us any kind
 of comparison as to the relative per day cost
 to the United States as compared with them?
 Secretary MCNAMARA. There is no possible
 means of developing that financially.
 Mr.  WHITTEN. It would be tremendously
 greater, would it not?
 Secretary MCNAMARA. The cost in economic
 terms is far greater to them than it is to us.
 One simple indication is that the intelli-
 gence estimators conclude that they have
 diverted from            thousand men from
 other pursuits to rebuild the roads and the
 bridges which our bombing has destroyed.
 And that particular diversion of the work
 force is but a minor part of their cost of
 carrying on their operations against the
 south.  Out of a society that has a total
 adult male population of perhaps 4 or  5
 million, that is a tremendous drain for just
 one part of their war activity.  So there is
 no question but what the relative economic
 cost to them is far greater than it is to us.
 PLAN FOR WINNING THE WAR
 General  WHEELER. May  I  answer  your
 question about what is our plan?  You said
 you do not know of a plan.
 Mr. WHITTEN. I would be glad to have you
 do so.
 General WHEELER. Before I do, though, I
 Would like to put in one remark that is
 perhaps  not  completely  germane to  this.
 (Off the record.)
 Mr. WHITTEN. The closing of bases and
 cutting back of the military.
 General WHEELER. No, sir.
 That is my point.    Now let me go to the
 other one if I might. We have actually had
 in South Vietnam substantial numbers of
 U.S. and free world combat forces for about
 6 months.  You should recognize that even
 then the weight of effort has been available
 only within about the last 2 months.
 The Republic of Korea division, for exam-
 ple, was only available to General Westmore-
 land in a combat configuration late in the
 month of November.  General Westmoreland
 has achieved to date, precisely what we esti-
 mated he would have achieved with these
 accruals of force;  namely, he has reversed
 an adverse trend of military events.  While
 he has not yet achieved a momentum which
 will give him "victory," he actually has just
 begun his campaign.  His concept, which is,
 I believe, a sound concept and one to which
 I subscribe, is this-
 Mr. MAHON. You mean the South Viet-
 namese?
 General WHEELER. Yes, sir.  (Off the rec-
 ord.)  It is not going to be a quick process,
 but it has been successful to date.

 The debate thus far has not given these
 views the attention they deserve.
 In these additional views Congress-
 men LIPSCOMB and LAIRD and I point out
 the diminishing effectiveness of the ap-
 propriations system under the heavy-
 handed practices of the Department of
 Defense.  -
 Within the last few years we have
 grown increasingly concerned as the De-
 fense Subcommittee and the Congress
 are relegated more and more to the role
 of rubberstamp in approving the dic-
 tates of the Department of Defense.
 The appearances of the Secretary of
 Defense, the Secretaries of the Army,
 Navy, and Air Force, the Joint Chiefs of
 Staff and their backup witnesses, grow
 more perfunctory each year. The abuse
 of the "top secret" stamp to blank out
 politically sensitive portions of their
 testimony before the subcommittee is
 evermore in evidence.  It has reached
 the point-where witnesses have in effect
 withheld their own views from the com-
 mittee unless pressed, and, when pressed,
 argue against their own position if it is
 contrary to top level Department of De-
 fense policy.
 We three minority members of the
 subcommittee feel that a blackout on
 much essential information was reached
 some time ago as far as the American
 public is concerned.  It is approaching
 a critical point as far as the Defense
 Subcommittee is involved.
 I call to the attention of the House that
 there were only 2 days of hearings on
 the bill we will pass today.
 It is our strong conviction that insuffi-
 cient attention was paid tomaintaining
 sufficient forces to meet U.S. commit-
 ments in portions of the world other than
 Vietnam.  We are convinced that de-
 fense needs have been underestimated
 in the 1967 budget now under considera-
 tion, just as they were underestimated
 last year, and that there will be supple-
 mental requests later this year similar
 to the one before us this afternoon.
 For those of you who have not had an
 opportunity to carefully read the addi-
 tional views in the report, let me quote
 from the summary:
 The growing frequency of reprograming
 actions Is of particular concern because it
 represents, in effect, a bypassing of Congress
 on matters that are often of critical concern.
 The financing of the war by supplemental
 demonstrates  a growing lack of planning
 which could, if not altered, produce serious
 risks for the future security of the United
 States, and, indeed of the free world.
 The growing tendency on the part of com-
 mittees of Congress to consider grave mat-
 ters in perpetual haste can only insure a con-
 tinued and rapidly increasing loss of control
 by the Congress over executive decisions and
 that these funds would be required.  I This committee has a vital role to play

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE           March 15, 1966
 A substantial amount of the supple-
 mental request for Thailand will go for
 this police program including such equip-
 ment as radios and transmitters.  It is
 my understanding that approximately
 $27 million will be allocated for public
 safety and police in Vietnam.
 On the recent trip which I made with
 the distinguished chairman of the For-
 eign Operations Appropriations Subcom-
 mittee [Mr. PASSMANl, I had the oppor-
 tunity of seeing firsthand the police
 training program in Thailand.  I was
 impressed by the work of Mr. Jeter L.
 Williamson, the Chief of the Public Safe-
 ty Division of our U.S. Operations Mis-
 sion in Thailand and of other American
 experts assisting the Thais in this impor-
 tant.program.  This is a practical kind
 of program conducted by the United
 States to help the Government of Thai-
 land increase the security of its border
 area and rapidly develop the counter-
 insurgency capability of the Thai civil
 police.  This same kind of program is
 being conducted in Vietnam and I was
 advised that it will cover 72,000 men
 there.
 There are questions which await an-
 swers as we consider this further funding
 to support the American commitment in
 Vietnam.
 Why  does  not  the  administration
 more aggressively pursue necessary ef-
 forts to bring about a halt to free world
 shipping to North Vietnam?
 When I questioned the Administrator
 of the Agency for International Develop-
 ment last month regarding this problem,
 he advised me, and I quote from the
 hearings:
 Last November, the only ships that called
 at North Vietnam outside of the Communist
 bloc countries were several flying the British
 flag but actually based in Hong Kong.  We
 are not, of course, providing any U.S. assist-
 ance to Britain.
 Mr. Chairman, the American people
 are disturbed, as am I, by the continuing
 trade by our allies with North Vietnam
 when American lives are being lost in far-
 off Vietnam.
 The American people are puzzled by
 administration policy which calls for in-
 stant cooperation with Great Britain in
 its difficulties with Rhodesia; but deals
 softly with the British regarding their
 trade with North Vietnam.
 Last year I made a motion at the time
 we had the conference report on foreign
 aid appropriations before the House to
 stop aid to the countries shipping mate-
 rials to North Vietnam.  That motion
 was defeated, and the President retained
 authority to use his discretion in giving
 such aid.  In recent months, there has
 been legislation introduced to bar coun-
 tries serving North Vietnam from send-
 ing their ships to U.S. ports. The admin-
 istration has blacklisted certain ships
 from  carrying  Government-financed
 cargoes; but this action does not go far
 enough.
 Another question which many Ameri-
 cans are asking: What is being done to
 secure the cooperation and participation
 of our allies in the Vietnam conflict?
 The American people have poured bil-
 lions of dollars into aiding our European
 allies, both militarily and economically,
 since World War II.  Now that the
 United States has gone to the aid of
 South Vietnam, it is obvious that the re-
 sponse for meaningful assistance from
 our allies has not been deafening.
 We will, however, examine very care-
 fully and with interest the administra-
 tion's  1967  foreign  aid  budgets  for
 respective countries around the world.
 We will keep in mind the 235,000 Ameri-
 cans who are on the frontlines fighting
 communism in southeast Asia, and in the
 political vernacular, we will ask the
 administration spokesmen:
 "What have these countries we are
 aiding done for us lately?"
 Mr. EDWARDS of California.  Mr.
 Chairman, I believe my position is clear
 on our commitment in southeast Asia.
 I have been opposed to our military
 policy in Vietnam.  I am strongly op-
 posed to escalation of the war, and I
 am distressed by the deterioration of our
 foreign and domestic policies which has
 been brought on by our Vietnam opera-
 tions.
 I will vote for H.R. 13546, the supple-
 mental  southeast  Asia  appropriation
 measure before this House today. I will
 do so because I feel it is unwise to decide
 policy issues through the appropriations
 process. Itis the job of the authorizing
 committees to debate policy matters.
 It is the job of the Appropriations Com-
 mittees to oversee the administration of
 duly authorized funds.
 A year ago, I opposed the $700 million
 supplemental  appropriation  for  Viet-
 nam.  I oppose that appropriation be-
 cause it was used only as a ruse to obtain
 approval of administration policy in
 Vietnam.  The $13.1 billion appropria-
 tion before us today-19 times as much
 money as we approved on May 5, 1965-
 has been duly authorized.  My policy
 reservations have been stated earlier.
 Today I can but remind my colleagues
 of them.
 My vote for this appropriation means
 two things.  It does not alone mean that
 I do not believe it is proper to express
 my policy preferences in an appropri-
 ations measure.  It also means that an
 appropriations measure should not be
 used by anyone else to express their pol-
 icy preferences. My vote today is not
 an endorsement of our past policy in
 Vietnam.  It is not an endorsement of
 our future policy in Vietnam.  It is not
 an endorsement of miltiary escalation.
 It is not an endorsement of the mining
 of Haiphong Harbor. And, it is not an
 endorsement of any increase in troop
 commitments.  It is merely a certifica-
 tion of prior House action on authoriza-
 tion measures.
 In supporting this measure and dis-
 cussing it with my colleagues in the
 House today, I am compelled to make
 certain observations about its contents.
 In voting $13.1 billion today, we are
 doing many things, and must be aware
 of them.
 We are appropriating $275 million for
 economic assistance programs within
 Vietnam.  However, we are in this same
 bill appropriating $742.6 million for mil-
 itary                                                               construction  within  Vietnam
 alone.    Thus we will spend in the com-
 ing fiscal year 270 percent more money
 for military construction than for socio-
 economic reconstruction.  And, we are
 spending $3.2 billion for aircraft pro-
 curement and $2.1 billion for procure-
 ment of munitions and associated equip-
 ment.  All of this money, as the report
 of our able Committee on Appropria-
 tions states, is "the amount of the budget
 estimates for the military, military as-
 sistance, and economic assistance pro-
 grams of the Government directly re-
 lated to operations in southeast Asia."
 Thus, in the coming fiscal year, our
 country will spend $1.1 billion to build
 in Vietnam, and $5.3 billion for the air-
 craft and munitions which will destroy
 the resources of Vietnam.  As I told this
 House only 13 days ago, we will continue
 to see destruction outpacing develop-
 ment.  We will continue to see our mili-
 tary commitment make a mockery of
 our calls for economic development; for
 a policy of millions for development and
 billions for destruction cannot succeed.
 My colleagues should also be aware
 that, despite the opening disclaimer of
 the Appropriations Committee report,
 not all the money in H.R. 13546 is going
 to programs related to southeast Asia.
 Twenty-five million dollars is going to
 the Dominican Republic in the form of
 economic aid.
 Finally, we should be aware that the
 $375 million appropriated for foreign
 military assistance will, according to the
 committee report, "be recorded on the
 books of the military assistance program
 and paid to the applicable procurement
 appropriation accounts of the military
 services, to reimburse those accounts for
 the value of goods already delivered to
 military  assistance  recipients."   A
 minority of the Defense Appropriations
 Subcommittee noted that this "was given
 scant attention by this committee."  I
 would only note that in our debates over
 the misuse of foreign military aid, we
 should not allow such aid to be awarded
 through  the  military   appropriation
 proper.  Foreign military aid is a sepa-
 rate issue with distinct problems, and
 should be considered separately.
 Mr. CLEVELAND.  Mr. Chairman, I
 shall vote for this massive, supplemental
 defense appropriation bill.  The Nation
 is engaged in a critical war and our mili-
 tary efforts must be fully supported.
 Nevertheless, I am deeply concerned
 about the manner in which this legisla-
 tion is being handled. We are here act-
 ing on a bill appropriating $12,345,719,-
 000 for the military functions of the
 Department of Defense, $375 million for
 the President to allot in military assist-
 ance, and $415 minion for him to allo-
 cate in economic assistance.
 This vast total is being handled in a
 supplemental appropriation bill on which
 the Appropriation Committee held only
 2 days of hearings.  In that time, of
 course, only the most cursory considera-
 tion could be given. In effect, Congress
 is unable to perform its constitutional
 task of carefully scrutinizing the admin-
 istration's requests and weighing them
 in detail.
 In view of this haste, one must ques-
 tion the wisdom and foresight of a gov-
 ernment which, Just a few months ago,
 did not conceive of these enormous extra

 could afford them but now has to raise
 them and seek from Congress an addi-
 tional $13 plus billion.
 Either the Government has not been
 honest in telling us what the war in Viet-
 nam was going to cost or its planning
 has been extremely bad.
 One does not wish to think that the
 Government does not know what it is
 doing nor does one wish to think that
 it is deliberately concealing facts from
 the public. It is hard, however, to avoid
 reaching either one conclusion or the
 other or, indeed, both.
 Mr. RYAN. Mr. Chairman, this is the
 first supplemental defense appropriation
 bill in this session for the prosecution of
 the war in Vietnam.   It embodies the
 $4.8 billion which the House authorized
 on March 1.
 When the $4.8 billion authorization bill
 was before'the House, I pointed out that
 a basic issue of policy was involved.  It
 was, I said, a bill to finance escalation,
 not to finance an existing policy.     I
 spelled out in my speech on March 1 my
 reasons for opposing what I called a
 policy of mindful escalation and my view
 that a policy of stabilization should be
 pursued. What I said then applies today.
 Mr. Chairman, the heart of this ap-
 propriations bill is the $4.8 billion which
 was authorized on March 1.  In effect,
 the appropriation contains an escalation
 rider. It is not simply an appropriation
 to support the present effort in Vietnam.
 The funds are intended to escalate the
 war.  As the distinguished chairman of
 the Committee on Appropriations, the
 gentleman from Texas [Mr.  MAHON],
 said earlier this afternoon that "the war
 will escalate and grow in intensity."
 This is not simply an appropriation to
 provide supplies and equipment to the
 courageous American fighting men who
 are engaged in combat. If that were the
 purpose, there would be no argument.
 As long as they are committed to battle,
 our dedicated forces must be adequately
 equipped, supplied, and protected in
 carrying out assigned missions. The real
 issue is the policy question embedded in
 the  authorization  and  now  in  the
 appropriation.
 In my speech on the supplemental de-
 fense authorization on March 1, I dis-
 cussed what I understood to be the im-
 plications of our vote. I said then that a
 debate was raging between those who
 believe that we should stabilize the war
 and those who believe that we should
 escalate it mindfully.  That debate still
 continues.
 The only opportunity the House has to
 express its views on foreign policy is
 when we are asked to authorize or ap-
 propriate funds. If we are to participate
 in this debate on Vietnam policy, we must
 do so this afternoon.  An affirmative
 vote, no mater how individual Members
 of the House may regard it, will be in-
 terpreted by the administration and the
 public as a full endorsement of adminis-
 tration policy.  A vote for this bill is a
 vote for the escalation rider as well.
 My vote this afternoon is not an easy
 one to cast. My thoughts are very much
 with the gallant American fighting men
 in Vietnam. They should not be denied
 anything they need.  I too fought in a
 jungle war in the Pacific some 20 years
 ago.  However, the administration has
 asked us to appropriate funds to allow
 the President to escalate the war. Once
 again the crucial question is not whether
 we will support the men in the field, but
 whether we will give the President the
 funds to commit hundreds of thousands
 of additional young men to this war on
 the Asian mainland.  As the Vietnam
 war stands today, this I am unwilling
 to do.
 Mr. Chairman, instead of pursuing a
 policy of extended escalation leading to
 an unlimited war in an "open-ended"
 military situation, as Senator  MANS-
 FIELD's report described it, the adminis-
 tration in a stabilized situation should
 explore realistic alternatives to escala-
 tion.  As I have said so often, the con-
 flict in Vietnam is not susceptible to a
 wholly military solution. It must be re-
 solved politically and diplomatically.
 The CHAIRMAN.  The Clerk will read
 the bill for amendment.
 The Clerk read as follows:
 ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE
 Supporting assistance
 For an additional amount for "Supporting
 assistance", $315,000,000.
 Mr. GROSS.  Mr. Chairman, I move
 to strike the requisite number of words.
 (Mr. GROSS asked and was given per-
 mission to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. GROSS.  Mr. Chairman, I rise at
 this time to ask a question or two con-
 cerning the emergency fund of $200 mil-
 lion.
 Is this in the nature of a blank check
 to the Department of Defense or to the
 Executive, or what is it?
 Mr. MAHON.  Mr. Chairman, if the
 gentleman will yield, is the gentleman
 talking about the funds for military con-
 struction or the contingency fund?
 Mr. GROSS.  I am talking about the
 language as shown in the report on page
 12-Secretary of Defense, $200 million
 for an emergency fund.
 Mr.MAHON.  This is military con-
 struction.  As the gentleman knows, this
 bill contains $1 billion, plus, for military
 construction, most of which is in Viet-
 nam.  The course of the war is rather
 unpredictable. This is the sum of money
 made available in order to meet the situ-
 ations as they may arise.
 Mr. GROSS.  Then, this is for the spe-
 cific purpose of construction?
 Mr. MAHON.  Yes.
 Mr. GROSS.  Now, how about the $100
 million for the contingency fund?  This
 seems to be a blank check to the Presi-
 dent.
 I was disappointed in reading the hear-
 ings of the gentleman's committee on this
 bill in that there was no indication as
 to how this money is to be expended.
 Mr. MAHON.  If the gentleman will
 yield further, it is a contingency fund.
 It is impossible to predict how a contin-
 gency fund will be used.  It may all be
 used in Vietnam and some of it might be
 used in Africa. It might be used else-
 where.  However, it is available to pro-
 tect the interest of the United States in
 this area of activity.
 5569
 I do not believe anyone can tell us
 how it might be used.  I wish it would
 not be necessary to use it at all.
 Mr. GROSS.  The gentleman from
 Texas suggested another question when
 he said "Africa."
 Does the gentleman have any idea as
 to how much money has been expended
 from the contingency fund for the pur-
 pose of joining with the British in the
 outrageous boycott  of  Rhodesia-in
 other words, using contingency funds to
 pay for the airlifting of oil and gasoline
 into Zambia, which has been cut off
 from its normal supply through Rho-
 desia?
 Can the gentleman from Texas bring
 us up to date on how many millions have
 been expended up to this point in financ-
 ing the British boycott?
 Mr. MAHON.  If the gentleman will
 yield further, I am not able myself to
 give the gentleman the answer as to
 what funds may have been expended in
 connection with this problem.
 Mr.  GROSS. Does the  gentleman
 have any part of the fear that I have
 that through this action in which we are
 presently engaged-this boycott of a
 friendly government-we may be com-
 mitting ourselves to another war, this
 time on the continent of Africa?
 Mr. MAHON.  I do not have any fear
 that we are committing ourselves to an-
 other war. It may be that not all of us
 fully support the actions with respect to
 Rhodesia, but this is one of the facets
 of our foreign policy, on which people
 may differ. However, the purpose of this
 fund is certainly not primarily for use
 in Africa, but to be available if necessary
 principally for activities associated with
 the war in Vietnam.
 Theoretically, of course, it could be
 used in other places.
 Mr. GROSS.  Well, the contingency
 fund voted for the President is being
 used for this purpose. My question went
 to how much has been used and how
 deeply are we being committed.  The
 Queen of England served notice as late as
 last week that if necessary the British
 would send troops to invade Rhodesia,
 and already we are hearing talk of the
 same tactics being applied to the Re-
 public of South Africa.
 Just how deeply we are being commit-
 ted is a grave question that should be
 of concern to every American.
 Mr. MAHON.  Mr. Chairman, if the
 gentleman will yield further, the gentle-
 man from Iowa is himself an important
 member of the Committee on Foreign
 Affairs of the House of Representatives,
 and I assume he is familiar with this
 matter and could possibly give a better
 answer to his own question than I could.
 Mr. GROSS.  I will say to the gentle-
 man that the Foreign Affairs Committee
 has just started hearings on the regular
 authorization bill today, and it will be
 my purpose to try to get full information.
 It is not always easy to obtain informa-
 tion, as the gentleman from Texas well
 knows, from certain individuals in this
 Government.
 I thought, perhaps, the gentleman
 from Texas and his committee had de-
 veloped information that I did not find
 in the hearings.

 WRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE           March 15, 1966
 Mr. MAHON. I know of no plan to
 use these funds for this purpose.
 Mr. GROSS.  I thank the gentleman.
 The  CHAIRMAN.  The  Clerk  will
 read.
 The Clerk read as follows:
 SEc. 102. Appropriations available to the
 Department of Defense during the fiscal
 years 1966 and 1967 shall be available to
 support Vietnamese and other Free World
 Forces in Vietnam and for related costs on
 such terms and conditions as the Secretary
 of Defense may determine: Provided, That
 unexpended balances, as determined by this
 Secretary of Defense,  of funds heretofore
 allocated or transferred by the President to
 the Secretary of Defense for military assist-
 ance to support Vietnamese and other Free
 World Forces in Vietnam shall be trans-
 ferred to any appropriation available to the
 Department of Defense for military func-
 tions (including construction), to be merged
 with and to be available for the same pur-
 poses and for the same time period as the
 appropriation to which transferred.
 Mr. MAHON.  Mr. Chairman, I have
 several amendments to section 102 at the
 desk and I ask unanimous consent that
 they may be considered as one amend-
 ment.
 The CHAIRMAN.  Without objection,
 it is so ordered.
 There was no objection.
 AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. MAHON
 Mr. MAHON.  Mr. Chairman, I offer
 an amendment.
 The Clerk read as follows:
 Amendment offered by Mr. MAHON: On
 page 8, line 3, insert "(a)" immediately after
 Sec. 102.".
 On page 8 line 5 insert "for their stated
 purposes" immediately after "available".
 On page 8, after line 16, insert the follow-
 ing:
 "(b) Within thirty days after the end of
 each quarter, the Secretary of Defense shall
 render to the Committees on Armed Serv-
 ices and Appropriations of the House of Rep-
 resentatives and the Senate a report with
 respect to the estimated value by purpose, by
 country, of support furnished from such ap-
 propriations".
 The CHAIRMAN.   The  gentleman
 from Texas [Mr. MAHON] is recognized.
 Mr. MAHON. Mr. Chairman, the pur-
 pose of this amendment is to make the
 language of the bill compatible with the
 language in the authorization bill which
 I understand was signed into law today.
 It undertakes to improve in a measure
 the actual wording of the authorization.
 It tightens up and make a little clearer
 the intent of the Congress with respect
 to this matter. The language in section
 102 as reported reads:
 SEC. 102. Appropriations available to the
 Department of Defense during the fiscal years
 1966 and 1967 shall be available to sup-
 port  Vietnamese  and  other  free  world
 forces in Vietnam and for related costs
 on such terms and conditions as the Sec-
 retary of Defense may determine: Provided,
 That unexpended balances, as determined
 by the Secretary of Defense, of funds here-
 tofore allocated or transferred by the Presi-
 dent to the Secretary of Defense for mill-
 When the amendment is agreed to, it
 will read:
 SEc. 102. (a) Appropriations available to the
 Department of Defense during the fiscal years
 1966 and 1967 shall be available for their
 stated purposes to support Vietnamese and
 other free world forces in Vietnam and for
 related costs on such terms and conditions as
 the  Secretary of Defense may determine:
 Provided, That unexpended balances, as de-
 termined by the Secretary of Defense, of
 funds heretofore allocated or transferred by
 the President to the Secretary of Defense for
 military assistance to support Vietnamese
 and other free world forces in Vietnam shall
 be transferred to any appropriation available
 to the Department of Defense for military
 functions  (including construction),  to be
 merged with and to be available for the same
 purposes and for the same time period as
 the appropriation to which transferred.
 (b)  Within thirty days after the end of
 each quarter, the Secretary of Defense shall
 render to the Committee on Armed Serv-
 ices and Appropriations of the Senate and
 House of Representatives a report with re-
 spect to the estimated value by purpose,
 by country, of support furnished from ap-
 propriations authorized to be made under
 this subsection.
 The point is to require reports to the
 Congress, through the appropriate com-
 mittees, within 30 days after the end of
 each quarter, with respect to the esti-
 mated value by purpose and by country
 of support furnished from these appro-
 priations.
 The basic section 102 provides that
 funds which would otherwise be labeled
 "Military Assistance" may be spent as
 direct military funds.  To some extent,
 in the future, comparability of funding
 levels will thus be distorted for both reg-
 ular military functions and military as-
 sistance. It is the purpose of this amend-
 ment to require that Congress be in-
 formed of the best estimates of the uti-
 lization of these funds.
 Mr. GROSS.  Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. MAHON.  I yield to the gentle-
 man.
 Mr. GROSS.  The purpose of section
 102, and I wonder if the gentleman agrees
 to this, is to provide that these funds are
 to be expended for the purpose for which
 the bill and the Congress intends that
 they shall be spent; is that correct?
 Mr. MAHON. That is correct.
 Mr. GROSS. The gentleman used the
 words "stated purpose."
 Mr. MAHON. Yes, for stated purposes
 such as procurement-providing certain
 funds for procurement-or for person-
 nel-and otherwise to support our allies
 including the Vietnamese.  The Viet-
 namese have'about 850,000 men, includ-
 ing local police forces, under arms. This
 language is designed to enable our Gov-
 ernment to support appropriately the
 efforts of those who :fight with us.
 Mr. GROSS. And that is, in Vietnam?
 Mr. MAHON.  In Vietnam-yes, of
 course.
 tary assistance to support Vietnamese and Mr. GROSS. That is the intent?
 other free world forces in Vietnam shall Mr. MAHON. Yes, that is the intent.
 be transferred to any appropriation-available Mr. GROSS. The intent is to support
 functions the Department of Defense for military the forces-whatever they may be-there
 functions (including construction), to be
 merged with and to be available for the same are too few there--but to support the
 purposes and for the same time period as forces in Vietnam and not -somewhere
 the appropriation to which transferred, else in the world?
 Mr. MAHON. That is certainly the in-
 tent of this amendment.
 Mr. RUMSFELD.  Mr. Chairman, will
 the gentleman yield?
 Mr. MAHON.  I yield to the gentle-
 man.
 Mr. RUMSFELD.  Did the gentleman
 say that the reports were to come di-
 rectly to the Committees on Armed Serv-
 ices and Appropriations in the House and
 in the Senate?
 Mr. MAHON.  That is with reference
 to the funds that are used for this pur-
 pose under the provisions of section 102.
 Mr. RUMSFELD.  I do not intend to
 raise the point, but I believe this would
 be subject to a point of order and is a
 violation of rule 40 of the House of Rep-
 resentatives which requires reports to
 come to the Speaker and to the House as
 a whole rather than to a specific com-
 mittee.  It  seems  to  me  the  reports
 should come to the House of Representa-
 tives and to the Senate, and to the ex-
 tent that they go directly to a committee
 and bypass the membership as a whole
 that the prerogatives of the Speaker of
 the House and of the membership as a
 whole are set aside.  I think it is. an
 important point although, as I say to the
 gentleman, I am not going to raise the
 point of order.  But I would hope that
 the Committee on Appropriations and
 the Committee on Armed Services would
 bring their bills in, when they call for re-
 ports, with the reports to come to the
 Speaker and to the President pro tem-
 pore of the Senate rather than going di-
 rectly to a committee.
 Mr. MAHON.  I think the gentleman
 has made a good point.  But, of course,
 anything that is made available to the
 committees is made available to the
 Speaker and to the Congress.  What we
 are doing here is to tie it in with the au-
 thorization language which has already
 been included in the law and which is the
 basis for the language in the amendment.
 Mr. -RUMSFELD. I do not quarrel
 with the intent of the amendment.
 Mr. LIPSCOMB.  Mr. Chairman, will
 the gentleman yield?
 Mr. MAHON.  I yield to the gentle-
 man from California.
 Mr. LIPSCOMB.  Mr. Chairman, the
 gentleman from Texas has talked this
 over at great length with the minority.
 We certainly agree as to the necessity
 for this amendment and heartily sup-
 port it.
 The language of section 102 as pres-
 ently contained in H.R. 13546 can readily
 be interpreted to give extremely wide
 latitude to the Secretary of Defense.
 The provision relates to military assist-
 ance type funds. But within the context
 of military assistance the present lan-
 guage could be interpreted to permit the
 merger of unexpended balances of fiscal
 year 1966 and prior year military assist-
 ance funds and future funds in fiscal
 year 1967 for South Vietnam with the
 accounts for military functions to be
 mingled between purposes.  In other
 words the present wording of the bill
 was susceptible of being interpreted as
 unlimited transfer authority.
 This provision is required because
 there is now no authority to use funds
 Approved For Release 2005/06/29 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000400040012-1
 March 15, 1966 Approved FCORlftyS?Iffly/2 EE&FP6    ff6R000400040012-1
 appropriated to the Department of De-
 fense for any purpose other than support
 of U.S. forces. Military assistance funds
 are now appropriated to the President
 and allocated to the Department of De-
 fense.
 The proposed amendment does not re-
 ject the request for authority to merge
 military assistance for South Vietnam
 with military functions but adds limiting
 language to that authority in two re-
 spects.
 First. It limits the transfer of author-
 ity to the extent that Department of
 Defense appropriations for a particular
 purpose must be kept within that pur-
 pose.  For example, personnel funds
 would be used for personnel, operation
 and maintenance for operation and
 maintenance, procurement for procure-
 ment, and so forth.  This limitation is
 provided by the addition of the words,
 "for their stated purposes."
 Second. The amendment adds a new
 subsection intended to assure that the
 Congress be kept informed on a timely
 basis of the use of these funds that may
 be made available for the support of the
 South Vietnamese and other free world
 forces under the authority granted in
 section 102. The amendment also states
 that the information be broken down by
 purpose and country in order to insure
 that the intent now expressed in section
 (a) be adhered to, and in the form that
 Congress will have the capability to over-
 see that it is.
 There is no intent to create any con-
 dition that will prevent our troops and
 the troops of the free world that are
 assisting us, from acquiring the neces-
 sary equipment and funds in a timely
 manner. This amendment will not jeop-
 ardize this process in the least. Its pur-
 pose is to make sure that congressional
 control is not diluted. The conditions as
 proposed in the amendment are that
 these fiscal transactions not violate the
 under consideration the bill (H.R. 13546)
 making supplemental appropriations for
 the fiscal year ending June 30, 1966, and
 for other purposes, had directed him to
 report the bill back to the House with an
 amendment with the recommendation
 that the amendment be agreed to and
 that the bill, as amended, do pass.

 STATEMENT
 The managers on the part of the House at
 the conference on the disagreeing votes of
 the two Houses on the amendments of the
 Senate to the bill  (H.R. 12169)  to amend
 further the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961,
 as amended, ana for other purposes, report
 that  the accompanying    conference report
 recommends that the Senate recede from its
 amendments.
 The managers on the part of the House
 pointed out that the amendment before the
 committee of conference dealt with matters
 which  had  not received  consideration by
 the Committee on Foreign Affairs during its
 consideration of the bill nor had there been
 any discussion during debate in the House,
 but they recognized that this question de-
 served careful consideration.  Because there
 has not been adequate opportunity to review
 in detail the full impact of the Senate pro-
 vision, the managers on the part of the
 House were unwilling to accept the Senate
 language, but they agreed that the Commit-
 tee on Foreign Affairs should look into the
 whole question during the consideration of
 the pending foreign aid bill.
 In view of the general feeling that hearings
 should be held on this whole question, the
 managers on the part of the Senate receded.

 SOUTH VIETNAMESE EXECUTION

 Mrs. MINK.  Mr. Speaker, a grave
 travesty on justice has been perpetrated
 by the Government of South Vietnam in
 the name of social and economic reform.
 The public justification for this execu-

 President Johnson at the Honolulu Con-

 I urge the President and the Vice Pres-

 Lest we make a mockery of our valiant

 of a democratic society.
 This barbaric act must not be allowed

 solution to an economic phenomenon is
 to invite the easy road to ultimate ruin
 without treating the cause at all.  A

 THE 118TH ANNIVERSARY OF HUN-
 GARIAN INDEPENDENCE
 (Mr. PATTEN asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute.)
 Mr. PATTEN.  Mr. Speaker, it is with
 special pride that I speak today-on the
 118th anniversary of the Hungarian up-
 rising for liberty against the Hapsburg
 dynasty.
 It is special for several reasons.
 It is special because my dear friend of
 many years, Bishop Zoltan Beky, presi-
 dent of the Hungarian Reformed Federa-
 tion of America, delivered the beautiful
 and moving prayer heard this noon in
 the House of Representatives.
 It is special because people who love
 and cherish freedom throughout the
 world have a particular respect for the
 Hungarian people.  They have always
 been champions of liberty.
 And it is also special because one of
 the greatest fighters and leaders that
 freedom ever had-Louis Kossuth-in-
 spired the Hungarian revolution for free-
 dom we are observing today.
 These revolutionaries for freedom were
 successful in their fight against tyranny
 and Louis Kossuth became head of the
 Government.  But their freedom did not
 endure and the revolution was over-
 throw by the Hapsburg dynasty.
 After Kossuth fled to Turkey, he later
 visited the United States, where he re-
 ceived many honors is a hero of free-
 dom.
 Judging not only from his deeds, but
 from the words of praise that came from
 some of America's greatest men, Louis
 Kossuth was indeed great.
 Greeting him at Concord, Ralph Waldo
 Horace lxreeiey, u.iiv~iaci  uui.=cc=,,
 mortal, said of Kossuth:
 Of the many popular leaders who were up-
 heaved by the great convulsions of 1848 into
 the full sunlight of European celebrity and
 American popular regard, the world has al-
 ready definitely assigned the first rank to
 Louis  Kossuth,  advocate,  deputy,  finance
 minister, and finally Governor of Hungary.
 Whittier lauded him as "the noblest
 guest."
 And as we near recent history, we note
 that Woodrow Wilson in 1918 praised
 Kossuth and said:
 I know the history of the gallant Magyar
 nation.
 Tribute was not restricted to Ameri-
 cans of renown.  The famous English
 economist and statesman Cobden de-
 clared:
 Kossuth is certainly a phenomenon: he is
 not only the first orator of his age, but he
 unites the qualities of a great administrator
 with high morality  and  an  indefatigable
 courage.
 Because he loved freedom so deeply,
 Kossuth recognized despotism and always
 fought it vigorously-with sword and pen.
 As far back as October 27, 1851, he ob-
 served:
 The principle of evil on the Continent is
 the despotic and encroaching spirit of the
 Russian power.   Russia is the rock which
 breaks every sigh for freedom.
 5573
 And Daniel Webster delivered an ad-
 dress of welcome to Louis Kossuth on
 January 5, 1852. His words express the
 feelings I have for the Hungarian people
 on this day of remembrance-and I be-
 lieve the feelings of many of my col-
 leagues.  Said Webster:
 Hungary stands out far above her neigh-
 bors in all that respects free institutions,
 constitutional government and a hereditary
 love of liberty.
 How true these words are even 114
 years later.
 The free world will always remember
 and admire the courage of the Hun-
 garian people in 1956, when they rebelled
 against the tyranny of communism.
 Their courage was an inspiration to the
 entire world.
 I visited Hungary last November and
 I observed with my own eyes that the
 people there have no freedom under
 communism. Russian soldiers with ma-
 chine guns make the whole country a
 jail. The people seem lethargic-almost
 as if life is not worth living.
 Mr. Speaker, on the 118th anniversary
 of the Hungarian uprising for liberty, let
 us pray to God that once again-soon-
 Hungary will be free.
 OREGON  COUNTY,  MO.,  MOVES
 AHEAD WITH NEW CONSERVA-
 TION DISTRICT
 (Mr. JONES of Missouri asked and
 was given permission to address the
 House for 1 minute.)
 Mr. JONES of Missouri.  Mr. Speaker,
 this month the Missouri State Soil and
 Water Conservation Districts Commis-
 sion authorized the people of Oregon
 County to move ahead in the protection
 and sound development of their soil and
 water resources by approving a soil and
 water conservation district for that
 county. This action resulted from a ref-
 erendum in which the people of Oregon
 County voted for a conservation district.
 Incidentally, this vote of approval was
 382 to 20.
 I have been extremely pleased with the
 stepped-up interest in soil and water
 conservation  districts  in  Missouri.
 Thirty-one have been formed in the last
 6 years, accounting for nearly half of the
 68 that have been formed since 1944.
 I believe that this indicates recognition
 of the benefits of sound conservation and
 development.  I believe that it also in-
 dicates recognition of the value of the
 district mechanism through which the
 Department of Agriculture and other
 Federal agencies can channel help to
 rural individuals and communities. It is
 a healthy trend and I hope will continue.
 Conservation districts have proved to
 be a sound way for communities to work
 together and plan for not just the pres-
 ent but for the long-term needs of the
 community. Their objectives to manage
 the land and water resources soundly
 .while developing them assures a commu-
 nity of resources that will remain an
 asset for future economic growth.  The
 reasons for supporting this vital con-
 servation movement are valid-whether
 viewed from the point of the care of re-
 sources themselves, or whether from the
 point of the economic value these re-
 sources have in the community.
 Louis Kossuth knew the threat of
 Russia even then but he also knew the
 promise of America. For about 116 years
 ago, he warned a gathering in Massachu-
 setts that, "From Russia, no sun will ever
 rise."
 But he had faith in America's purpose
 and dream, for he also told that group:
 To find the sunlight where it most spreads
 and lightens the path of freedom, we must
 come to America.
 In 1852, Kossuth was presented to the
 United States Senate and also to the
 House of Representatives.  He did not
 speak long, but, as always, spoke with
 eloquence. He said:
 It is remarkable that while in the history
 of mankind, through all the past, honors
 were bestowed upon glory, and glory was at-
 tached only to success, the legislative au-
 thorities of this great Republic bestow the
 highest honors upon a persecuted exile, not
 conspicuous by glory, nor favored by success,
 but engaged in a just cause.  There is a
 triumph of republican principles in-this fact.
 Later, Louis Kossuth, in heavy demand
 as a brilliant speaker, gave almost 300
 public addresses, all unforgettable.
 Mr. Speaker, on this day of tribute to
 the Hungarian people, it is hard to con-
 clude, because our hearts and thoughts
 are full of gratitude and love.
 Since Louis Kossuth will always be the
 symbol of the courageous and freedom-
 loving Hungarian people, I would like to
 quote from the poem written by James
 Russell Lowell, named "Kossuth."
 Land of the Magyars, though it be
 The tyrant may relink his chain,
 Already thine the victory,
 As just future measures gain.
 Thou hast succeeded, thou hast won
 The deathly travail's amplest worth,
 A nation's duty thou hast done,
 Giving a hero to our earth.

 The congressional district which I
 represent-in which this new conserva-
 tion district is located-is a highly pro-
 ductive area and represents a large part
 of the agricultural income of the State.
 I have observed some of the conserva-
 tion work that local people have done to
 overcome water management and flood
 problems.  Some of these problems the
 individual farmer can handle by him-
 self.  Many require broader technical
 assistance such as is available through
 soil and water conservation districts.
 Many of the resource problems are of a
 community nature where a group ap-
 proach is required. Here again, the con-
 servation district provides coordinated
 action.  Its farsighted and comprehen-
 sive resource inventories and programs
 are responsive to the needs and desires
 of the community because they are
 planned and carried out by local people,
 I commend soil and water conserva-
 tion districts for the vital role they have
 taken in community development and I
 am gratified that Oregon County has
 joined their ranks, and am hopeful that
 the few remaining counties in the 10th
 district which do not have soil conserva-
 tion districts will give serious considera-
 tion to the benefits which they might
 derive from the creation of such districts.
 OPPORTUNITY CRUSADE
 (Mr. GOODELL asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr. GOODELL.  Mr. Speaker, hear-
 ings are now underway on the poverty
 program. Congressman QUIE and I are
 pressing for consideration of our pro-
 posal to substitute an opportunity cru-
 sade for the misfiring war on poverty.
 Last week, Mr. Shriver testified rather
 superficially on a  variety of issues.
 Among other things, In his prepared test-
 imony, he made the incredible statement:
 Since last summer fewer than 50 ineligibles
 have been discovered in the Neighborhood
 Youth Corps.
 The very next day, Secretary Wirtz
 contradicted Mr. Shriver by admitting
 that at least 5,090 to 6,000 enrollees in
 the Neighborhood Youth Corps have been
 found ineligible and dropped since last
 summer; 1,700 were dropped in Chicago
 alone since January 1.  Now they are
 saying that these are welfare cases,
 barely exceeding the strict poverty stand-
 ards. Well, a quick spot check of widely
 'dispersed records in Chicago gives quite
 a different picture. Although arbitrary
 handling of the hearings prevented me
 from questioning Mr. Shriver on these,
 here are some samples. I have removed
 the names of the enrollees to spare them
 embarrassment; however, they are avail-
 able to officials who may be interested:
 Male enrollee, 17, family of four, father
 head of household, income $11,000 a year.
 Male enrollee, 19, family of five, father
 head of household, income $10,200 a year.
 Female enrollee, 19, family of two-
 housewife with no children-husband
 head of household, income $5,000-plus a
 year.
 Female enrollee, 18, family of three-
 an only child-father and mother both
 work, earn jointly $150 per week.
 Female enrollee, 20, family of three-
 an only child-fatl: idr head of household,
 income $7,500 a year.
 Male enrollee, 17, family of six, father
 head of household, income $7,000-plus a
 year.
 Male enrollee, 19, family of five, grand-
 father head of household, income $7,000-
 plus a year.
 Male enrolee, 18, family of six, father
 and mother both work, earn jointly $500
 a month.
 Male enrollee, 20, family of five, father
 head of household, income $5,400 a year.
 This is the program supposed to help
 poor youngsters who are school dropouts
 or likely dropouts for reasons of poverty.
 Obviously, a full investigation would re-
 veal many times more than Mr. Shriver's
 50 ineligibles in Chicago alone. And no
 wonder. Last November the public rela-
 tions representative for the Chicago
 poverty program stated:
 We don't know what the families of kids
 make.  No straight flat figure on what an
 applicant family should make has been set.
 We have no statistics on incomes of the fam-
 ilies of the kids in the Corps.  We  assume
 that, when we receive a name from the
 Illinois State Employment Service, the candi-
 date named is qualified.
 At that time, the executive director of
 the Chicago program was quoted as
 follows:
 It is absolutely correct that, until today,
 no means test was given in recruiting.
 Almost one-quarter of the total en-
 rollees in Neighborhood Youth Corps in
 Chicago had to be dropped because they
 exceeded the income requirement. At the
 same  time,  the poverty director in
 Chicago admits that there are at least
 35,000, and others estimate up to 60,000,
 young people between, the ages of 16
 and 22 in Chicago who fully meet the
 poverty  standards  for  Neighborhood
 Youth Corps but weren't given a chance.
 Mr. Speaker, these are not isolated
 cases; they prevail all over the country.
 In addition to the 1,700 dropped in
 Chicago, Mr. Jack Howard, director of
 the Neighborhood Youth Corps, admitted
 that about 2,000 in New York City and at
 least 1,000 in Los Angeles were ineligible.
 That is close to 5,000 ineligibles from
 three cities alone.
 In the next few days, I will discuss
 other serious violations in the poverty
 program in Chicago. In the meanwhile,
 let me emphasize that the Quie-Goodell
 opportunity crusade would correct these
 deficiencies and put 50,000 youngsters
 into productive jobs in private enter-
 prise through a new Industry Youth
 Corps.
 DEFENDING FREEDOM WITH
 FREEDOM
 (Mr. SAYLOR asked and was given
 permission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the RECORD, and to include ex-
 traneous matter.)
 Mr.  SAYLOR.  Mr.  Speaker,  last
 month Roger M. Blough, chairman of the
 board, United States Steel Corp., and a
 native of my hometown, delivered an ad-
 dress at the Founders Day Banquet of
 Washington University in St. Louis, Mo.
 Since a portion of it deals with the fiscal
 responsibilities of Congress, I commend
 Mr. Blough's presentation to my col-
 leagues.
 Without question, lack of restraint on
 the part of the administration in re-
 questing appropriations and lack of re-
 straint on the the part of Congress in
 making such funds available are the ma-
 jor provocations in an inflationary trend.
 They are the principal impediments to
 holding onto the value of our money.
 Providing the finest equipment and
 tools of war is the topmost consideration
 at this time. As Mr. Slough has estab-
 lished, however, this cost has not reached
 a point where it can be tagged as the sole
 reason for the growing excess of Federal
 expenditures over Federal income.  The
 real culprit is bureaucratic waste, and it
 cannot be tolerated if Congress has any
 intention of holding the line against the
 destructive forces of inflation.
 Under   unanimous   consent,       Mr.
 Blough's address appears herewith:
 Founders day in any university provides a
 welcome opportunity to indulge in recollec-
 tions of past achievements.  It serves to re-
 call the humble beginnings of what, in this
 case, has proven to be a monumental educa-
 tional venture that was undertaken more
 than a century ago.   Everyone associated
 with  Washington University may well  be
 proud of its history, its traditions, and of its
 past performance which weighs so heavily as
 a promise for the future.
 People have come to expect great things,
 of this university and of its graduates; and
 if I do not dwell, tonight, upon the com-
 mendable degree to which these expectations
 have been fulfilled, it is only because I am
 understandably  reluctant  to  do  anything
 which might contribute to, inflation-even
 of the ego.
 But founders day, as you observe it on this
 campus, has a current purpose which trans-
 cends the mere recognition of a fine and
 noble tradition.  It provides a unique oc-
 casion to contemplate contemporary issues
 of mounting importance.  Many of you will
 recall that last year, the Chief Justice of the
 United  States    discussed with  you  the
 "foundations of freedom" as those founda-
 tions are imbedded in the law, the Constitu-
 tion and the Bill of Rights.  And in doing
 so, he shed much penetrating light upon an
 4ssue of profound importance to the future
 of this Nation.
 Tonight, I should like to consider with you
 another aspect of freedom which seems to
 me to be of imminent importance and which
 certainly touches the lives of all of us.  It
 concerns the preservation of economic free-
 dom in America while we seek to defend the
 political freedom of other peoples through-
 out the world.
 As we meet here, we, are confronted by
 the fact that despite prodigious efforts to
 reach a negotiated peace, our Nation is en-
 gaged in what might-if you wish-he called
 a negotiated war.  Two hundred thousand
 American men are now fighting in Vietnam.
 Each month, some thousands of others are
 receiving their "greetings" from Uncle Sam.
 And present indications are that before the
 year is out the number of American troops
 engaged in this conflict will have more than
 doubled.
 So for the fourth time in this century,
 American youth has answered the call to
 repel aggression in foreign lands, to protect

 adequate help from most of the other free
 nations; and by extreme barriers to under-
 standing.
 Meanwhile,  among our people here at
 home, there are some who question vehe-
 mently the necessity, the wisdom or even
 the morality of our involvement in this war.
 And this, too, is an exercise of freedom that
 few of us would seek to deny, I suppose, how-
 ever deeply we may disagree with such ex-
 pressions.
 But there is one basic point, I believe,
 upon which true Americans can never dis-
 agree:  That everything needed to protect
 the  lives  of  our  soldiers  in  Vietnam
 shall be provided to the limit of our na-
 tional resources, both material and human.
 If the sacrifice of economic freedom will, in
 fact, hasten the winning of the peace in
 Vietnam and reduce our casualties there,
 there can hardly be any loyal opposition to
 such a sacrifice.  But if, on the other hand,
 the economic freedoms which have made
 this Nation the most productive in the
 world are-as I believe them to be-a unique
 source   of   our  military  and  economic
 strength, then we should, and must, defend
 and preserve them in the national interest.
 In short, the question before us is: To
 what degree may we assist in the fight for
 freedom by relying upon freedom-freedom
 in production, freedom to buy and sell, and
 freedom in occupation?  Or must we revert
 to wartime types of wage controls, or price
 controls, materiel controls and even controls
 of movement among occupations in order, as
 a nation, to wage the defense of freedom?
 The question is a grave one; and it Is none
 too early to explore it now in the cool, un-
 emotional light of reason and fact; for the
 good sense and the patriotic endeavors of
 the American people will have much to do
 with  determining its solution.  What the
 people think, and what they say to their Rep-
 resentatives in Congress, is certain to Influ-
 ence the final decision since eventually-
 under our ' system of laws-Congress must
 make that decision.
 Let us consider, then, three aspects of this
 question. Do the pressures generated by the
 war in Vietnam, plus those created by. a
 rapidly growing economy, make controls nec-
 essary now or in the foreseeable future?  Do
 the economic disruptions caused by controls
 themselves negate or outweigh the benefits
 to be expected from them?  Are other, less
 disruptive means available for use in dealing
 with these pressures?
 Turning first to the question of necessity,
 we recall that in World War II and again
 during the Korean conflict controls were im-
 posed upon production, distribution, wages
 and prices in order to channel the necessary
 portion of our Gross National Product into
 the  war effort.   How then do conditions
 today compare with those that existed be-
 fore?
 At the end of World War IT, there were
 11,500,000  men  in  our  Armed  Forces-or
 171/2 percent of the total labor supply. Dur-
 ing Korea, there were 3,500,000 men In the
 military, representing over 5 percent of the
 labor force; and about 475,000 of these were
 actually engaged in Korea.
 Last year, some 2,800,000 men were in the
 armed forces and this accounted for only
 3.6 percent of the labor supply.  Future re-
 quirements, as presently projected, could call
 for an additional 300,000 men In the services;
 but even if that number were to rise to 500,-
 000, the military drain on the national labor
 force would amount to only about 4 percent
 as compared to more than 5 percent during
 the Korean conflict.
 And as for Vietnam itself, the 200,000 men
 now stationed there  constitute only one-
 fourth of 1 percent of our national labor sup-
 ply; and President Johnson reports that the
 total production of goods and services for
 the war "accounts for less than 11/a percent
 of our gross national product."
 So it is evident, I think, that Vietnam is
 not the primary source of the economic pres-
 sures we are experiencing.  Vietnam may
 provide an excuse for the advocacy of con-
 trols.  But it is not a reason for them; and
 if we seek out the major cause of these pres-
 sures, we must look to the unusually rapid
 rate of our economic growth In the non-
 military areas.
 Last year, the American economy grew at
 a greater rate than that of any other major
 industrial nation in the world.  After cor-
 recting for rising prices, the real rate of
 growth was 51/2 percent; and all of this new
 activity increased the demand for manpower,
 and the upward pressure on wages and prices.
 During the 1960's, the expansion of the
 supply of money and credit has been at twice
 the rate prevailing in the late 1950's.  Gov-
 ernment expenditures at all levels-Federal,
 State, and local-have increased 65 percent
 since Korea even though there has been no
 appreciable rise in military outlays.    Thus
 virtually all of this increase has occurred on
 the nondefense side of the ledger.
 As a result, a head of economic steam is
 building up to a point which is beginning
 to cause national concern lest it break out
 in a burst of rising wages and prices.  And
 this concern is understandable at a time
 when we are confronted by a stubbornly
 continuing imbalance of international pay-
 mets, a worrisome outflow of our dwindling
 gold supply, the need to widen the narrowing
 gap in our favorable balance of trade, and the
 necessity of preserving the integrity of the
 dollar  as  a medium  of  international  ex-
 change.
 Trying to find out how long we can con-
 tain this mounting head of steam while con-
 tinuing to heat up the boiler is something
 like playing Russian roulette.  Certainly we

 No. 45-6
 5575
 man-hour in each of the past 3 years; so unit
 labor costs have kept mounting.  Across the
 economy  generally,  labor  settlements last
 year exceeded the guidepost limits of 3.2 per-
 cent; and a recent release by the Department
 of Labor reports that in the construction In-
 dustry, for example, wages and benefits rose
 4.8 percent during the past fiscal year, while
 their study of a limited number of these
 labor contracts negotiated in 1965 revealed
 increases averaging 6.1 percent and ranging
 up to 8.3 percent.
 Under the pressure of these rising costs
 and of the increased economic activity gen-
 erally, the Consumer Price Index has risen
 11 percent since 1957-59, and the tempo has
 accelerated recently.  In fact I might add,
 parenthetically, that during the 7 years since
 the end of 1958, the cost of living has gone
 up about six times as much as the price of
 finished steel.  But I mention that only in
 passing.
 Further  energizing  this  trend  toward
 higher wages and consequent rising prices
 is the fact that we now have practically full
 employment, and there is an actual shortage
 of skilled workers.  Only about 4 percent of
 the labor force is presently classified as un-
 employed, and the Council of Economic Ad-
 visers reports that this figure will drop to
 33/4 percent for the current year and will be
 well below that level at year's end.  Among
 married men, unemployment is now down
 to 2 percent and is still declining.
 Under all of these circumstances, it will
 clearly become increasingly difficult to main-
 tain an acceptaale degree of wage and price
 stability through the publication of guide-
 posts and the powers of Presidential persua-
 sion; and the question arises:  "What next?"
 So the situation that confronts us today
 is much like that which prevailed at the
 end of 1960, when the United States had
 started down the road to wage and price
 controls.  Then, as now, the road was paved
 with requests for a voluntary freeze;  and
 standards for the freeze were being drawn
 up.  Under the pressures of that day, the
 prices of many products were rising; and the
 prospect of price control, itself, added greatly
 to these pressures as producers and mer-
 chants sought to cover their rising costs
 before the  freeze  hit  them.   Production
 shifted from lower price lines to more ex-
 pensive, and more profitable goods; and re-
 tailers built their inventories to a record
 high, thus adding to demand in an already
 overheated economy.
 But before we travel that road again, let
 us stop, look, and listen, for it is one thing
 to talk of controls and quite another thing
 to survive them.  There is no doubt that
 for a limited period they can and do hold
 down the lid on prices.  There is also no
 doubt, however, that they create scarcity
 and thus add to the economic pressures that
 caused their adoption  in the  first place.
 Some of us whose memory goes back to the
 controls of 20 years ago will recall the butter
 that was sold from under the counter to
 favored customers, and the deterioration in
 the quality of merchandise that occurred as
 producers and merchants were often forced-
 at the peril of their own survival-to pay
 higher-than-ceiling prices on purchases in
 order to get the materials to keep their busi-
 nesses running.
 Then, too, there is a wasteful deployment
 of manpower at a time when a shortage of
 manpower already exists.  Under the normal
 operation of a free market, the people them-
 selves-as  buyers-determine  what  man-
 power will be allocated to what production.
 If  they do not choose to buy a certain
 product, then that product will no longer
 be made and the manpower will go elsewhere
 to produce what is wanted and needed.
 Controls  not  only  wipe  out  this  self-
 adjusting, competitive mechanism, but-by
 their almost unbelievable complexity-they

 CONGRESSIONAL, RECORD - HOUSE           March 15, 1966
 create enormous new manpower demands in
 the administration and the application of
 the regulations.
 To illustrate, let me recall that during the
 Korean war, United States Steel's operations
 were  under  control  by  eight  different
 Federal agencies, the most important of
 which were the National Production Author-
 ity and the Office of Price Stabilization.
 Regulations and directives of the National
 Production Authority aggregated about 300,-
 000 words and underwent approximately 400
 amendments, supplements, revocations, and
 directions.
 The Office of Price Stabilization issued 37
 different regulations applying to our business.
 One ceiling price regulation alone consisted
 of almost 30,000 words and was amended 41
 times with 20 supplemental regulations.  So
 estimate if you can the number of account-
 ants, lawyers, engineers, and ohers required
 to keep up with these regulations; expand
 that to cover all the businesses in the coun-
 try, big and small; add the thousands em-
 ployed in the administration of these con-
 trols on the Government side, and you come
 up with some idea, at least, of the great
 wastage of manpower that is inherent in the
 mere application of controls themselves.
 But, you may ask, can the Defense Depart-
 ment-in the absence of controls-get what
 it needs to carry on its military efforts?  The
 answer is that it can and it does.  We already
 have a system of priorities under which De-
 fense has first claim on essential production.
 But will not the Government have to pay
 more than it should?  And the answer to
 that is also s}mple; for the Government is
 the sole buyer of war material while there
 are many sellers competing for its business.
 Thus we have the opposite of a monopoly-
 a monopsony.  And as a monopsony, the
 Government imposes conditions of purchase
 under which it exercises the right to rene-
 gotiate contracts and to reclaim an adjudi-
 cated part of the purchase price if the profits
 on the sale are deemed too large.
 But then, you may ask, how about the
 average fellow, the pensioner, or widow liv-
 ing on a fixed income.  Without controls, is
 there any better way of keeping prices from
 skyrocketing?  And here, I can only think
 of the ardent young suitor whose proposal
 of marriage had been firmly rejected by the
 girl of his dreams.
 "Tell me," he pleaded, "is there anyone
 else?"
 "Oh, Elmer," she replied, "there must be."
 So it is with controls.  There must be bet-
 ter solutions; and I believe that there are.
 In the first place we must recognize that
 our productive capacity in America is ex.
 panding substantially every year;  so there
 is an ever-increasing supply of goods and
 services to meet our Nation's demands, both
 military and civilian.
 The President has called upon business to
 exercise restraint in its pricing policies; and
 has asked labor unions to keep their demands
 within certain bounds.  Here it must be
 said that the two problems are somewhat
 different,  Among businesses there is a high
 degree of competition which tends to repress
 prices;  but among unions there is also a
 high degree of competition-more in the
 nature of political competition-which tends
 conversely to escalate wages.
 For example, transit workers in New York
 recently won wage and benefit increases far
 in excess of guidepost limits; and now it is
 announced that the New York City Police
 will seek pay boosts that will also shatter
 the guideposts concept.
 It goes without saying that among labor
 unions you will find just as many patriotic
 and dedicated men as in any other segment
 of our society.  These men, however, have a
 real problem.    They feel compelled by force
 of circumstance to demand "more" in behalf
 of the individuals they represent.  That is
 their function and their job; and it is asking
 much of them when they are called upon to
 exercise restraint.
 Similarly it is the inescapable obligation
 of business managers to keep their enter-
 prises healthy and to generate the profit
 necessary to keep America's industrial facili-
 ties modern and competitive-not only in the
 interest of the owners but in the national
 interest as well.   So there must be some
 wage and price flexibility to accommodate
 the myriad changes that occur from day to
 day.  Yet I believe that the wiser heads in
 the leadership of both labor and business will
 recognize that the exercise of restraint in
 the highest possible degree is imperative at
 a time when the probable alternatives are
 rising costs and runaway prices or disruptive
 controls.
 But restraint is not a, one-way street, and
 no matter how diligently and patriotically
 business and labor may try to plug the leaks
 in the economic boiler, they cannot succeed
 unless someone stops pouring on the coal.
 And that, I believe, is where Congress comes
 in.  On the monetary side, the Federal Re-
 serve Board is authorized and equipped to
 retard the expansion of currency and credit;
 and I would not anticipate that Congress
 would seek to oppose the necessary exercise
 of these powers.
 On the fiscal side, Congress can ease the
 pressure by the judicious use of taxation;
 and the President has already recommended
 the reinstatement  of  certain  excise  taxes
 and a speed-up in the payments of personal
 and corporate income taxes.
 But it is in the area of restraint in appro-
 priations and other legislation that the hard-
 working men on this Hill face both their
 most difficult problems and their greatest
 opportunity to prevent a further heating up
 of the economy; for it is they who control
 the purse strings.
 Today we dream of an America where there
 will be no slums, no pockets of poverty, no
 illiterates, no unemployed, no discrimina-
 tion, no lack of medical facilities for all, and
 a minimum of crime.  And, being Americans,
 we are impatient to reach  those shining
 goals--which is as it should be.  But exces-
 sive impatience at a time of great economic
 pressure can be disastrous and produce the
 wage  and  price explosion which  neither
 guideposts nor controls can permanently pre-
 vent.                                                                      And it is up to all of use to recognize
 that we cannot have what I call instant
 affluence.
 Certainly it should be possible to defer a
 number of programs which call for pouring
 of additional dollars into the economy from
 Government  sources,  however  meritorious
 those programs might be under other cir-
 cumstances.
 Is it necessary, for example, to press for-
 ward with make-work types of projects at
 a time when manpower is already scarce and
 growing scarcer?
 Is this a time to undertake other large
 governmental expenditures which will divert
 manpower from more immediately necessary
 production?  No one discounts the value of
 training the youth of this Nation and pro-
 viding jobs for them; but is it not better
 for them to be trained on the job while
 earning their own keep and doing useful
 work? And does not the growing shortage of
 skilled workers create new opportunities for
 the unskilled to acquire skills?
 Then, too, is this the year to enact, for
 example, a law increasing the minimum wage
 by 40 percent, and at the same time talk
 about a 3.2-percent limit on increases un-
 der the guideposts?  Will this not tend to
 elevate the entire wage structure when the
 increased social security and medicare taxes
 that went into effect last month have already
 added at least two-thirds of a percent to em-
 ployment costs generally-an addition, in-
 cidentally, which the guideposts do not take
 into account?
 Is 1966 the year in which to federalize un-
 employment  compensation  by  legislation
 that will add still further to the cost of em-
 ployment in hundreds of corporations all
 over the country?
 In short, is this the time to enact-in the
 name of social progress-far-reaching pro-
 grams that are costly, inadequately managed
 because of the lack of trained manpower,
 and in many instances designed to correct
 situations that the present economic buildup
 is already tending to correct without gov-
 ernmental intervention?
 The answer is up to the Members of Con-
 gress.  It is their prerogative to authorize
 expenditures.  It is their obligation to view
 the economic picture as a whole and act in
 their own best wisdom.
 Summing up, then, this is a plea for rec-
 ognizing where we are as a nation-a na-
 tion which necessarily must meet its com-
 mitments abroad and maintain its economic
 strength at home.
 It is a plea for practical restraint by both
 business and labor.
 It is equally a plea for restraint on the
 part of Congress which will finally determine
 the extent of the pressures unleashed in our
 economic system.
 It is even more a plea to recognize that the
 most effective way to help our Government
 achieve its purposes is not through the im-
 position of controls-and that even the sug-
 gestion  of  controls  breeds  apprehensions
 which induce scare buying and, in turn, in-
 crease the upward tendency of wages and
 prices.
 Above all, this is a plea to recognize the free
 market economy for what it is: the most ef-
 ficient, productive source of our material
 freedom; and to acknowledge that interfer-
 ence with the markets operation leads to
 inefficiency, inequity, and to shortages.
 In a word, it is a plea to defend freedom
 with freedom.

 THE BANK EXAMINERS
 If the special bank investigating commit-
 tee created by the 1965 legislature has the
 best interest of all Ohio in mind, there will
 be no whitewash of any bank practice, nor
 of any particular bank or banks.
 Under its chairman, State Senator Charles
 W. Whalen, Jr., of Dayton, the committee
 has opened its hearings in Columbus.  The
 legislator responsible for its creation-Sen-
 ator  Oliver Ocasek-was  not shown the
 courtesy of being named to the committee.
 But Ocasek has said he will be present.
 Certainly the committee can do no less than
 hear him explain in detail just why he be-
 lieved Ohio needed such a probe into its
 State-chartered banks at this time.
 If he suggests, as he has indicated he
 would, that there are dangerous signs of ex-
 treme concentration of power in State bank-
 ing circles, then let's see if such concern is
 justified.
 The banking community of Ohio Is in need
 of no whitewash.  It is sound enough to
 take without a quiver a searchinsg examina-
 tion into its methods of operation-and its
 interlocking interests.
 We in Cleveland, home of the State's larg-
 est banking institution-the Cleveland Trust
 Co.-will be watching the work of this com-
 mittee with great interest.

 BANK'S  CHIEF SKIPS LEGISLATURE'S HEARING
 (By Gordon C. Raeburn)
 COLUMBUS.-The first legislative study of
 Ohio's banking laws and regulations since
 1933 is off to a slow start because of the State
 commerce department's division of banks.
 The six senators and nine representatives
 wanted to discuss the State's problems in
 regulating and examining Ohio's banks at
 yesterday's first hearing.
 Neither Banks Supt. Clarence C. Luft nor
 any of his employees appeared as requested.
 State Representative William L. Elliott,
 Democrat, of Malta, the committee's vice
 chairman, said "It is extremely relevant that
 we have someone here from the banking de-
 partment."
 State Senator, Anthony O. Calabrese, Demo-
 crat, of Cleveland, said the committee could
 not go ahead until the superintendent of
 banks appeared to discuss problems in the
 banking industry.
 Meantime, the legislative service commis-
 sion has been asked to gather information
 it can in two areas:
 Adequacy of the State division of banks
 to conduct regular examinations of banks as
 required by law.
 Advisability of changing the method by
 which the superintendent of banks is se-
 lected.
 Dave Johnson, acting head of the legisla-
 tive service commission, told the committee
 that present Ohio law makes no reference
 to experience requirements of the superin-
 tendent.  He is appointed by the Governor.
 He suggested a look into the method of se-
 lecting the superintendent and scrutiny of
 the  bank  examination  requirements  and
 whether they are being met as part of a
 six-point study of the banking industry and
 laws.
 Other points on the Johnson recommenda-
 tion, which the committee temporarily ac-
 cepted, were:
 Legality and propriety of any bank voting
 its own shares of stock.
 Adverse effects of interlocking directorates
 and holding of stocks.
 ,Appropriateness  of  standards  used  in
 granting charters and branch bank permits.
 Enlarging the powers of the banking ad-
 visory board.
 State Senator Charles W. Whalen, Jr., Re-
 publican, of Dayton, chairman, asked the leg-
 islative research commission to obtain a
 transcript of all testimony concerning Ohio
 banking which has been given before the
 House Banking Committee, headed by Con-
 gressman  WRIGHT  PATMAN,  Democrat,  of
 Texas.
 The executive manager of the Ohio Bankers
 Association, O. E. Anderson, said his organi-
 zation welcomes the study.
 "We  have  complete  confidence  in your
 ability in not allowing this to become a
 witch hunt," Anderson said.
 He said the association is sure the com-
 mittee would "approach it [the study] on
 an industry basis and not be swayed by ex-
 traneous matters and personalities."
 Although the committee is primarily con-
 cerned with State banks, it will 'compare
 regulations affecting national banks with
 State laws.
 There are 548 banks in Ohio, of which 332
 are State banks.

 .UNJUSTIFIED ABSENTEEISM
 The  leisurely probe  of State-chartered
 banks by the legislature's bank investigat-
 ing committee got off to a sorry start. Nei-
 ther State Banks Superintendent Clarence
 Luft nor any of his employees appeared as re-
 quested.
 This uncooperative attitude gives added
 weight to those speculations that the probe
 will accomplish little.  So does the date of
 the next public meeting, March 14.
 This investigation is important.  Ohioans
 should know how much financial power is
 concentrated  in  State-chartered  banks.
 Luft and his staff insult the legislature and
 the public by their uncooperative attitude.
 Governor Rhodes should be sure his em-
 ployees are present when the committee re-
 sumes March 14.
 FREE AIRMAIL SHIPMENT TO
 SERVICEMEN IN VIETNAM
 The SPEAKER pro tempore.  Under
 previous order of the House, the gentle-
 man from New York [Mr. HALPERN] is
 recognized for 15 minutes.
 Mr. HALPERN.  Mr. Speaker, today
 I Introduced legislation to provide free
 armall shipment of parcels to our serv-
 icemen in Vietnam.
 I have had the privilege of visiting our
 fighting men in Vietnam, and I can at-
 test to the fact that there is nothing like
 a gift from home, to boost the morale of
 our GI's at mail call.  Whether it be
 knitted socks from a GI's girlfriend, a
 box of cookies from mother or an inter-
 esting book from father, it makes a GI
 feel more remembered.
 I firmly believe that this is the least
 we can do.  The sending of gifts on a
 large scale will reflect to our fighting
 men, a gratified public; and the free use
 of the mail will reflect a grateful govern-
 ment.  Campaigns urging the public to
 send books and other gifts of interest
 have been gaining considerable support,
 but they would be given a real impetus
 if we allowed these modest mailing
 privileges.
 The bill would, among other things,
 allow for the free airmail shipment of
 parcels weighing up to 10 pounds to our
 servicemen in Vietnam. In addition, the
 language is broad.enough to cover any
 similar future situations in which U.S.
 forces are engaged in hostilities with any
 foreign force.
 I believe that those who donate, col-
 lect and wrap these gifts, and carry them
 to their local post offices perform a truly
 laudable service, and the least the Fed-
 eral Government can do is absorb the
 three or four dollars it costs to ship one
 of these gifts.
 I invite my colleagues to join in spon-
 soring this legislation, and I urge the
 Committee on Post Office and Civil
 Service to accord full considdr6,tipk to
 FREE WORLD SHIPPING TO NORTH
 VIETNAM
 The SPEAKER pro tempore.  Under
 previous order of the House, the gentle-
 man from Michigan [Mr. CHAMBERLAIN],
 is recognized for 10 minutes.
 . (Mr. CHAMBERLAIN asked and was
 given permission to include lists.)
 Mr. CHAMBERLAIN.  Mr. Speaker,
 from time to time during this past year,
 I have endeavored to keep my colleagues
 of the House informed about the serious
 problem of free' world shipping to North
 Vietnam.  Just recently I received the
 report on this shipping for the month of
 February and take this occasion to make
 this information available to the Mem-
 bers of the House.
 The unclassified information for the
 month of January shows that seven free
 world ships called at North Vietnamese
 ports during that month as follows:
 NAME OF  SHIP, FLAG,  GROSS  TONNAGE,  AND
 DATE ARRIVED
 Agenor, Greece, 7,139 gross tons, January 25.
 Amon, Cyprus, 7,229 gross tons, January 28.
 Hellas, Greece, 7,176 gross tons, January 19.
 Kanaris, Greece, 7,240 gross tons, January
 19.
 Milford, United Kingdom, 1,889 gross tons,
 January 4.
 Shienfoon, United Kingdom, 7,127 gross
 tons, January 9.
 Shirley Christine, United Kingdom, 6,724
 gross tons, January 31.
 During the month of February, there
 were six such arrivals, all of United
 Kingdom registry, as follows:
 NAME OF SHIP, FLAG,  GROSS  TONNAGE,  AND
 DATE ARRIVED
 Ardtara, United Kingdom, 5,975 gross tons,
 February 15.
 Greenford, United Kingdom, 2,961 gross
 tons, February 19.
 Milford, United Kingdom, 1,889 gross tons,
 February -.
 Shienfoon, United Kingdom, 7,127 gross
 tons, February 2.
 Shienfoon, United Kingdom, 7,127 gross
 tons, February -.
 Wakasa Bay, United Kingdom, 7,040 gross
 tons, February 7.
 While the volume of this trade has
 decreased substantially from what it was
 during the first 2 months of 1965, I
 hasten to point out that the secret re-
 ports show more than twice the number
 of vessels just mentioned.
 While it is regrettable that this traffic
 was permitted to flourish for so long, the
 administration officials responsible for
 finally acting to bring about a reduction
 of this trading with the enemy are cer-

 tainly to be commended for their efforts.
 That this trade has been reduced clearly
 shows that effective measures can be
 taken to discourage our friends from
 such shipping activities.
 In recent weeks there have been re-
 ports that Norwegian shipowners have
 privately agreed to stop plying the North
 Vietnamese trading lanes.  In addition,
 King Constantine of Greece signed a de-
 cree effective as of March 10 forbidding
 the use of Greek-flag vessels in carrying
 cargoes to or from North Vietnamese
 ports, except for those already under
 charter before the decree was effective.
 These actions are most encouraging.
 Nevertheless., the attitude of our own
 Government remains decidedly less than
 fully satisfactory. The gap in our official
 efforts has invited, and perhaps required,
 the independent initiative of non-Gov-
 ernment organizations to bring full pres-
 sure to bear to dry up this trade such as
 the threatened boycott proposed by the
 Maritime Unions of the east and gulf
 coast ports.  As I join those who com-
 mend the Maritime Unions for their
 concern I must at the same time express
 disappointment with the administra-
 tion's abdication of the conduct of for-
 eign policy in this field.
 Now, however, is not the time to relax
 our efforts.  Our momentum must not
 be lost. It must be accelerated to elimi-
 nate entirely the possibility of even one
 free world ship going to North Vietnam.
 To accomplish this there must be fuller
 information provided to the American
 people and to the world about this trade.
 If free world ships are helping to supply
 the enemy, why should our people be
 told half the truth-why not the whole
 truth?
 A good measure of the success achieved
 in curbing this trade has been due to an
 aroused and informed public opinion
 both within and without the Congress.
 If we are to keep faith with the hun-
 dreds of thousands of boys we have sent
 to Vietnam, we must not fail in giving
 them our full support.  I call upon the
 administration to be more forthright in
 reporting the true extent of this aid and
 comfort to the enemy.
 Mr. GROSS.  Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. CHAMBERLAIN.  I am happy to
 yield to my colleague from Iowa.
 Mr. GROSS.  Again I commend the
 gentleman from Michigan for bringing
 this information to the Members of the
 House.  I ask the gentleman if it is not
 also important that pressures be applied
 to these various countries, including
 Britain, which are shipping to Red
 China?  By this devious route they can
 still provide the sinews of war to North
 Vietnam.
 This involves' not alone the question
 of shipping to Haiphong, but also the
 question' of shipping to Red China.
 Why should there, also, shipping to
 Communist Cuba, which has become the
 spawning  ground  and  the  training
 ground for subversion in the Western
 Hemisphere?
 It seems to me that the State Depart-
 ment and the officials of this Govern-
 ment ought to be applying pressure not
 only with respect to North Vietnam but
 also with: respect to trade with Red
 China and with Communist Cuba.
 Mr. CHAMBERLAIN.  I thank the
 gentleman for his contribution.  I share
 those views completely.
 The administration certainly should
 be looking at these areas.
 I have called attention to North Viet-
 nam because this is such a flagrant case.
 Hundreds of thousands of our boys are
 there tonight, in combat with the enemy,
 while our friends are carrying material
 to keep the war going.  This should not
 be tolerated.

 CHICAGO  TRIBUNE'S  SPECTACU-
 LAR REPORT ON CHICAGO
 The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
 a previous order of the House, the gen-
 tleman from Illinois [Mr. PucINSHI] is
 recognized for 15 minutes.
 (Mr. PUCINSKI asked and was given
 permission to revise and extend his re-
 marks, and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. PUCINSKI.  Mr. Speaker, the
 Chicago Tribune has begun a spectacular
 series on the history, growth, and the
 present magnitude of Chicago as a world
 center of commerce, industry, .science;
 religion, education, sports, and culture.
 I am taking the liberty of putting this
 series in the RECORD as it unfolds be-
 cause I would like to share with my col-
 leagues and the distinguished readers
 who follow the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD
 the real story of how Chicago-once
 called the Crime capital of the world-
 today stands as a model city of the
 world.
 The Chicago Tribune deserves the
 highest commendation for its fair and
 impartial writing of one of the great
 stories of our time-the renaissance of
 America's second largest city.
 Mr. Dave Halvorsen has magnificently
 captured the spirit of Chicago, 1966.
 I hope those around the world who
 are so quick to criticize this thriving
 metropolis known as Chicago will read
 Mr. Halvorsen's penetrating series.
 Recently I said that the second half
 of the 20th century belongs to Chicago.
 This dynamic series in the Chicago Trib-
 une fortifies my contention; and it gives
 a new spirit of pride and dedication to
 31/2 million people who live in Chicago.
 The Chicago Tribune is performing a
 most significant public service in bring-
 ing to all Americans-through its influ-
 ential and widespread national circula-
 tion-the real story of Chicago as it
 exists today.
 The first articles of the Chicago Trib-
 une series follow.  It is my plan to in-
 clude the rest of the articles as this im-
 pressive series unfolds:

 CHICAGO SHAKES OFF OLD LABEL OF SECOND
 CITY-"PRAIRIE TowN" ADDING NEW FRONTIERS
 (By David Halvorsen)
 (NOTE.-Chicago has come alive in the last
 10 years and is experiencing the greatest
 prosperity in its history.  Its citizens see its
 municipal development not as problems but
 as challenges.  The Tribune begins today a
 comprehensive and exhaustive series of arti-
 cles analyzing Metropolitan Chicago's resur-
 gence and what it will mean in years to
 come.)
 Chicago forged a giant structure of pros-
 perity in the last decade to place the city at
 the threshold of the greatest era in its his-
 tory.
 The midwestern metropolis is fulfilling the
 dreams of those who believe in it.
 Once called a prairie town because it was
 one, and later called a prairie town in spite,
 because it was not one, the city has come
 alive and is one of the most vibrant, pro-
 gressive cities in the world.
 Thomas H. Coulter, chief executive direc-
 tor of the Chicago Association of Commerce,
 has called it "the most enlightened city in
 the world today."
 HAS YET TO HIT PEAK
 The city has yet to reach the peak of its
 current resurgence, and chances are it will
 not for a long time, asserts Mayor Daley.
 Chicago is not advancing in the wake of
 a prosperous economy; it is leading the surge.
 It has shaken off the. inferiority complex of
 the crime-ridden prohibition era and the
 era's legacy of civic doldrums which set in
 after the depression and lasted for nearly
 25 years.
 "For years we believed what everyone said
 about us," said a city hall official. "We kept
 comparing  Chicago  with  perfection.  Now
 we have changed.  We are comparing it with
 other great cities, and we are coming out
 first.
 "Perfection is the ultimate goal.  We are
 closer to it than anyone else."
 Civic leaders are calling this the "sensa-
 tional sixties," outstripping even the great
 rebuilding era following the  Chicago  fire
 of 1871 which burned out 2,124 acres of the
 central city and caused property damage of
 $200 million.
 PRODUCT IS HUGE
 Metropolitan Chicago's shame of the gross
 national product, the sum of all services and
 manufactured goods, is $34.4.  This is six
 times more than the national output of
 Austria and greater than that of all the
 Scandinavian countries combined.
 The area's industrial development is twice
 that of its nearest competitor-&nd that in-
 cludes New York City.  More than 4,000 new
 factories have been constructed here in the
 last 20 years, most in the last decade.
 "At one time the industrial center of the
 United States was just west of New York
 City," Coulter pointed out.  "Now it is in
 Chicago and will be for a long time to come."
 Studies by Coulter's association show the
 average family income of metropolitan Chi-
 cago to be $11,400.  This is 30 percent more
 than the national average and $1,000 more
 than New York City.
 T4 e association places the Indiana coun-
 ties of Lake and Porter and the Illinois coun-
 ties of Cook, Lake, McHenry, Du Page, Kane,
 and Will in the metropolitan area.
 LOOP IS FOCAL POINT
 The drama of the pity's prosperity is per-
 formed in the central business district with
 the Loop as a stage for all the world to see.
 Here are giant buildings, some with revo-
 lutionary forms of architecture.
 The erection of the Prudential Building in
 1955 was the breakthrough.  It was the first

 New York City experienced an extraordi-
 nary post-World War II construction boom
 while little was happening in Chicago. Now,
 New York is beset with major municipal
 problems while Chicago and its suburbs leap
 ahead.
 Daley, a Democrat, first was elected in 1955.
 Chicago's revival closely parallels the emer-
 gence of his leadership.
 Businessmen, industrialists, labor and civic
 leaders all give their respective professions
 much of the credit for this new vitality, but
 they point to Daley as the perso'h who
 brought all the forces together.
 BRINGS ABOUT RAPPORT
 "The mayor has brought about an amalga-
 mation of the best of labor, politics, religion,
 education, and business," said Edward Loge-
 lin, vice president of the United States Steel
 Corp. and chairman of the Chicago. plan com-
 mission. Logelin is a Republican.
 "When he gets us around the conference
 table, It is not to talk about differences but
 the common interests of Chicago."
 In pinpointing the reasons for Chicago's
 resurgence, 1959 is a vintage year.
 After 7 years of discussions, work com-
 menced on O'Hare International Airport.
 The St. Lawrence Seaway opened, making
 Chicago an international port. Chicago was
 host to the Pan-American games. The city's
 first international trade fair took place and
 the Queen of England came to visit.
 Her reception was quite different from
 that of the first royalty to visit the city.
 PRINCE WAS INVITED
 That was in 1860, when Long John Went-
 worth, the mayor, invited Albert Edward,
 Prince of Wales and later to become Edward
 VII, to visit Chicago.
 The prince accepted on the condition he
 could come incognito as Baron Renfrew.
 There was to be no fanfare.
 Edward underestimated Chicago's resource-
 fulness. When he started to tour the city,
 shiny fire engines fell in behind his carriage.
 Then came numerous floats representing the
 city's industries, and 50,000 persons lined his
 route along Wabash and Michigan Avenues.
 This sort of spirit always has been a char-
 acteristic of Chicago.
 It is with this same energy that Chicago is
 beating the drums for new business.  The
 city's emissaries have been well received in
 New York City and other cities by business-
 mgn anxious to learn of the advantages of-
 fered here.
 COMPUTER TELLS STORY
 When Chrysler Corp. decided to build a
 new plant, it collected basic information
 from probable sites throughout the country.
 This data was put on 1,600 tabulating cards
 and fed to a computer.  The answer came up
 Belvidere, east of Rockford, and only 75 miles
 northwest of Chicago.
 A key reason was Chicago's vast transpor-
 tation  network.  It  is                           the  center of  the
 world's air, rail, and truck systems and is
 rapidly developing as a seaport.
 Businesses are finding that the prestige
 address of New York City may be costing
 them thousands of dollars in extra operating
 costs.
 An accountant association in New York
 City made a survey of operation costs in
 Chicago.  The association found it could
 save $70,000 annually in air fares alone by
 locating here.
 A confectionery company discovered it's
 more economical to import cocoa beans,
 needed for chocolate, through Chicago and
 market the finished product from here than
 to import the beams through east and west
 coast ports.  The company closed down its
 coast operations.
 FOUNDED AS TRADING POST
 Chicago Is only 129 years old.  It was
 founded as a frontier trading post.  It is now
 the greatest trading center in the world.
 Its image has been given a big boost be-
 cause of the misfortunes that have befallen
 New York City.
 New York has a per capita bonded debt
 of $446.07.  Chicago's is $145.90.  Further-
 more, Chicago's bonded debt is of short
 duration and represents 42 percent of the
 city's constitutional  limit of indebtednes.
 New York's heralded World's Fair fell short
 of expectations.   The city has experienced
 crippling newspaper strikes and the recent
 transit strike.  It was the victim of a power
 surge which blacked out the New England
 States.
 The east coast metropolis faces another
 severe water shortage this summer unless
 New England gets above-normal snowfall the
 rest of this winter.
 Crime publicity, which had made Chicago
 a favorite whipping boy for three generations,
 has tapped a lucrative source in recent years
 in New York City.
 Chicago has not had a newspaper strike
 in. 17 years.  It last had a mass transit strike
 in  1922.   Commonwealth Edison has  said
 that the massive blackout which hit New
 England is unlikely :here.
 WATER SUPPLY IS EXCELLENT
 The water supply in Chicago is excellent.
 A city resident can get unlimited water for
 approximately  $30  a year.   This  includes
 garbage pickup.  Chicago provides water to
 61 suburbs.  The city put into operation a
 year ago the world's largest and most modern
 water filtration plant.
 Jarred by the Surnmerdale police scandal
 in 1961, Chicago :reacted positively to reform.
 Police Superintendent O. W. Wilson stream-
 lined the police communications system, in-
 creased the number of squads on the street,
 boosted the prestige of the policeman, and
 instituted Operation Crimestop, a program
 encouraging citizens to report crimes and
 suspicious activities.
 Last year. crime on Chicago streets de-
 clined 12 percent although every other metro-
 politan city and the Nation as a whole re-
 ported  substantial  increases.   Chicago's
 police administration has become a proto-
 type for other municipalities, both foreign
 and national.
 The summer before the great fire of 1871,
 Chicagoans were paying more in fire insur-
 ance rates than they were contributing in
 municipal, county, and State taxes combined.
 By contrast, Chicago today has a class II
 rating from the National Board of Under-
 writers for fire insurance.  What makes this
 remarkable is that no city has a class I
 rating and only :11 cities have class II.  Chi-
 cago is the only city of more than 1 million
 population among the 11.
 HAS LOW DEATH RATE
 The  city                        had the  lowest metropolitan
 traffic death rate in 1960, 1962, and 1964, and
 earned the honor again in 1965.  Chicago
 has received the cleanest city award in 5 of
 the last 6 years.
 The  resurgence  reaches  far beyond the
 boundaries of the city or the 7.5 million
 persons living in the eight-county metro-
 politan area.  Chicago's influence on the en-
 tire Midwest is probably greater than is
 actually realized, civic leaders point out.
 For example, a truck pulling out of a Chi-
 cago terminal tonight with a cargo of manu-
 factured goods will be unloading at a ware-
 house  in  Charles  City,  Iowa,  360  miles
 distant, tomorrow morning.
 Many producers have found it more eco-
 nomical to export overseas from the port of
 Chicago than through the coastal cities of
 New Orleans and Baltimore.
 A  canning  factory  in  Madison, Tenn.,
 which exports canned corn to northwestern
 Europe, has found it cheaper to ship through
 Chicago than New Orleans.
 GET FAVORABLE RATES
 Minnesota,    Nebraska,  and  Kansas  pro-
 ducers are discovering more favorable ship-
 ping rates through the Chicago port.
 Businessmen are continually revising the
 boundaries of the Chicago trade area.  Now
 they think in terms of a 500-mile radius
 which includes a population of 63 million.
 The revitalization of the  railroads,  the
 completion of the Interstate Highway Sys-
 tems and city expressways, and the expan-
 sion of the seaport make all of this realistic.
 Historians have called Chicago the most
 American  of  all  cities.  Some  have been
 critical of the premium put on the dollar by
 Chicagoans.
 MANY BECOME WEALTHY
 The society of other great cities was based
 on heritage.  Chicago's society was deter-
 mined by bank accounts.  Great personal
 fortunes have been made here, and in many
 different ways.
 The Palmers, Armours, Fields and others
 became  some  of  the  world's  wealthiest
 families.
 In assessing the drive behind Chicago's
 current prosperity, history may offer a lesson.
 At the very beginning, Chicago's wealthy
 leaders found private gain and public in-
 terest were compatible.
 A healthy city meant a prosperous busi-
 ness.  The formula is still working today.
 [From the Chicago (Ill.) Tribune, Mar. 6,
 1966]
 CHICAGO  GROWTH        TO  GREATNESS  IS  ONLY
 BEGINNING
 (By David Halvorsen)
 The wagon trains trundled regularly into
 the dirt streets of Chicago in the     1830's.
 They set up temporary camp south of Fort
 Dearborn along what is now Michigan Ave-
 nue.
 Most were fortune seekers heading west-
 ward, but some assessed, quite accurately,
 that the frontier town had a future and
 therefore was a place to make a lot of money
 and make it fast.
 Indian trails had led to the confluence
 of the Chicago and Des Plaines Rivers, and
 for much the same reason the pioneers fol-
 lowed these routes.  It was a logical way to
 get across the country.
 GEOGRAPHY TRUMP CARD
 Soon followed the steam locomotive.  Chi-
 cago became the terminal between the East-
 ern and Western railroads.  Later came the
 highways bearing motorcars, the waterways
 to the Mississippi River and the sea, and the
 airlines.
 Geography has been Chicago's trump card
 since the city went after the high stakes of
 becoming one of the world's  great urban
 centers.
 In the last decade the city has been dealt
 a handful of aces.
 1. Metropolitan Chicago is the industrial
 center of the world.  The area, with 3.8 per-
 cent of the national population, produces
 5.1 percent of the gross national product.
 NEAR POPULATION CENTER
 2. The population center of the United
 States is on a 160-acre farm, 6.5 miles north-
 west of Centralia and about 1 mile south-
 southwest of the community of Shattuc in
 Clinton County.
 3. - Illinois is the leading agricultural prod-
 ucing State in the union.
 4. Chicago is the center of the world's
 greatest transportation network.

 March 15, 1966            CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE
 FOUR PREVIOUS POINTS
 The North Vietnamese National Assembly
 on April 10, 1965, had posed these four points
 as conditions for negotiations:
 1, All U.S. troops must withdraw from
 South Vietnam.  (It was not stipulated that
 withdrawal would have to take place before
 a negotiated settlement rather than after,
 so this point was apparently left open for
 bargaining.)
 2. Pending peaceful reunification of Viet-
 nam, the 1954 military agreement must be
 respected and both North and South remain
 neutral.
 3. Internal affairs must be settled by South
 Vietnamese themselves, "in accordance with
 the  program of the  National Liberation
 Front," without any foreign interference.
 4. Peaceful reunification of Vietnam to be
 settled by Vietnamese people in both zones
 without foreign interference.
 These conditions are subject to long and
 tortured interpretation, but they are not a
 complete bar to discussions.  They are not
 irreconcilable with the 14 points set forth
 by President Johnson on January 3, 1966.
 The President's offer of negotiation terms,
 however, quickly drew the new and impos-
 sible fifth point from Ho Chi  Minh.  He

 place at the conference table to the govern-
 ment we have supported in Saigon.  To do
 so would be to surrender the people we have
 Made our allies to the Communists, fully
 and finally.  It would be to seal the fate of
 South Vietnam without an expression of the
 will of the people.
 It is a familiar technique in a dispute for
 one side to offer to talk, but set conditions
 it knows its opponent cannot conceivably
 accept.  The Soviet Union has played that
 game in the long struggle for disarmament.
 Now Hanoi makes negotiation unattainable,
 while loudly accusing America of bad faith
 in its efforts toward peace.
 The Intransigence of Hanoi does not mean
 that America should abandon all efforts to
 negotiate.  If anything, it increases our duty
 to maintain and strengthen our peaceful
 intentions.
 But in the meanwhile there is no use
 blinding ourselves to what is happening in
 Hanoi and Peipig.  The Communist leaders
 believe they are going to win, and they will
 at present accept no compromise short of
 total victory.

 "If the present persists in setting in
 judgment on the past, the future is lost.,,
 The time is now for action. The sig-
 nals have already been called, and the
 ball is in motion. America has no other
 choice than to execute the play, and to
 smash forward to a touchdown.  This
 does not mean that our policy or methods
 are no longer open to discussion, or even
 to criticism. Far from it. On several oc-
 casions I myself have raised my voice
 against sloppy and inefficient practices
 which I felt were militating against our
 success in the field. I shall continue to
 do so.
 It is one thing, however, to offer con-
 structive criticism, in order to improve
 the war effort.  It Is another thing to
 embarrass, or obstruct, or to deliberately
 weaken our national will to fight. With
 an? such effort I have no sympathy.
 There has been so much said about
 what we are doing wrong, and so little,
 comparatively speaking, about what we
 are doing right.  It is with a view to
 strengthening our will, and putting our

 that I am taking this time to review,

 In the field of psychological warfare.
 We hear so much about the conventional
 battles that are raging in Vietnam, and
 about the statistics on casualties suf-
 fered, lives lost, and planes and materiel
 destroyed.  The real war however, is
 being fought, not for the bodies but for
 the minds of the Vietcong.  The work
 of JUSPAO is no less significant because
 It receives so little recognition.  In my
 opinion It is our ultimate weapon.
 SELECTIVE ACHIEVEMENTS OF JUSPAO
 GENERAL
 Just as crucial as, and in the long run
 more important than, the current mili-
 tary effort in Vietnam is the struggle for
 the hearts and minds of the Vietnamese.
 At the heart of this psychological task is
 communication-particularly communi-
 cation between the populace and their
 government.   In the U.S. mission, the
 agency with primary responsibility for
 counseling and assisting the Government
 of  Vietnam--GVN-in  the  field  of
 psychological action is the Joint United
 States Public Affairs Office-JUSPAO.
 JUSAPO was created In May 1965 as a
 result of President Johnson's decision
 giving the Director of USIA authority
 over all U.S. psychological operations in
 Vietnam. The majority of the American
 staff are USIA officers, but others come
 from the Department of State, AID, and
 the U.S. military.  Headed by a senior
 USIA official-who is also Minister Coun-
 selor of Embassy for Information-
 JUSPAO Is a U.S. mission organization
 which provides unified direction for all
 U.S. psychological action in Vietnam.
 Having directly integrated the com-
 munication media functions of USAID
 Vietnam, JUSPAO Is the U.S. civilian
 channel for providing communication
 equipment and technical advice to the
 GVN. Through policy direction given to
 the psywar operations of MACV's Politi-
 cal Warfare Directorate, JUSPAO helps
 assure close coordination between U.S.
 civilian and military psywar personnel in
 provincial operations.
 JUSPAO has three main psychological
 objectives: First, to strengthen the Viet-
 namese will to support GVN/US mutual
 objectives; second, to strengthen the gov-
 ernment's communication media and
 programs to increase popular support of
 its overall objectives;  and third, to
 strengthen free world support for Viet-
 nam and of Vietnamese support for U.S.
 worldwide policy objectives.
 In pursuit of these objectives, JUSPAO
 has over 150 American officers and nearly
 400 Vietnamese employees.  Ideas, per-
 sonal contact, media materials, and com-
 munication equipment are tools and
 channels in this war for men's minds.
 The impact of various JUSPAO programs
 very often is localized.   The successes
 may not lend themselves to newspaper
 headlines.  They are the backside of
 news, and some of these are capsulized
 below.
 RADIO
 In a country like South Vietnam where
 literacy rate is low,, particularly in the
 rural area, radio is a vital link between
 the Government and the people.  In the
 past, the Radio Vietnam-VTVN-with a
 station in Saigon and several regional
 transmitters was not fully utilized or co-
 ordinated because of poor organization,
 lack of trained personnel and program-
 ing skills.  As a first step toward helping
 the GVN develop a more truly national
 radio network, JUSPAO convinced and
 assisted the GVN in December 1965 to
 restructure Radio Vietnam into a semi-
 autonomous broadcasting corporation.
 Steps are now being taken to link the
 existing stations into a national network.
 Two JUSPAO radio advisory teams are
 actively engaged In training Vietnamese
 in program production, station and net-
 work management and administration,
 and central and regional programing.
 One of the teams is assigned to the VTVN
 while the other is assisting the Vietna-
 mese Defense Ministry's Voice of Free-
 dom Station which broadcasts to North
 Vietnam.
 JUSPAO also produces locally between
 60 and 75 hours of radio programs every
 week for placement with Vietnamese
 stations.  From Washington, the Voice
 of America broadcasts to South and
 North Vietnam 61/2 hours daily in Viet-
 namese.                                                                    The Voice maintains a trans-
 mitting and relay complex in Hue, South
 Vietnam, just south of the 17th parallel.
 The 50,000 watt, medium-wave relay
 transmitter has directional antennas
 capable of providing strong signals to
 both North and South Vietnam.  Over
 the past year and a half, incidentally,
 the site has been shelled by the Vietcong
 several times.
 OTHER MEDIA
 JUSPAO effort Is not confined to radio.
 A publication adviser is working with the
 Vietnamese Ministry of Psywar in the
 production of pamphets, leaflets and
 posters.  In the GVN's National Motion
 Picture Center, a JUSPAO adviser helps
 in all aspects of the conception and pro-
 duction of newsreels, documentaries and
 feature films.  To help the GVN improve
 its press output and thus to facilitate
 coverage of Vietnam developments by
 foreign newsmen, a JUSPAO press ad-
 viser is assigned to the Vietnam Press,
 the Government's national news agency,
 to provide on-the-job training and class-
 room Instructions on journalism.
 PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS IN THE PROVINCES
 JUSPAO operates extensively in rural
 South Vietnam, and some 40 American
 JUSPAO field representatives are sta-
 tioned in the provinces to give assistance
 and support to cadres of the Vietnamese
 Information   Service-VIS-in   psy-
 chological  operations.  The  tasks  of
 JUSPAO field representatives cover a
 wide  spectrum;  namely, stimulating
 action by provincial psychological oper-
 ations committees in every province; as-
 sisting in the publication of 24 provincial
 newspapers  and  programing  of  re-
 gional radio stations; showing GVN and
 JUSPAO  films    made  for  provincial
 audiences; developing posters, pamph-
 lets, leaflets and other publications de-
 signed for audiences in a particular pro-
 vince or even district; employing air-
 borne loudspeakers and leaflet drops
 for fast exploitation of local issues; and
 deploying  VIS  and  JUSPAO cultural
 troups which present a government mes-
 sage via entertainment.
 A considerable part of the JUSPAO
 effort in the Provinces has gone into
 supporting  the  Government's  Chieu
 Hoi-Open Arms-program which en-
 courages Vietcong and their followers to
 return to government-controlled areas.
 Where local Chieu Hoi programs are
 imaginatively and vigorously pursued
 and where especially effective leaflets
 and othe. ? messages are employed, the
 psychological tasks of persuasion has
 yielded results.  The following incidents
 show this by the extent of Vietcong re-
 action and counteraction.
 In August, 1965, 150,000 copies of a
 JUSPAO-originated leaflet were air-
 dropped into parts of Vinh Binh Prov-
 ince in the Delta.  According to re-
 turnees who defected on the basis of it
 as well as captured Vietcong documents,
 within 3 days every Vietcong found
 picking up or holding this leaflet was
 immediately transferred to another re-
 gion so that he would not "contaminate"
 others.  Also around this time, in Vinh
 Long Province nearby, the Vietcong
 were driven to holding public meetings
 to counter the Chieu Hoi appeal.  The
 villagers in these public meetings were
 warned that anyone found with a leaflet
 was liable to be shot.  They were also
 told that anyone going over to the gov-
 ernment side in response to the appeal
 would be tortured.
 That Vietcong threats and intimida-
 tion have not been fully effective can be
 seen in the number of individuals who
 have responded to the Chieu Hot appeal
 since the program was launched in Feb-
 ruary 1963.  From that time to date,
 some 30,000 Vietcong and their followers
 had returned to the government side;
 11,000 of them came back during 1965
 alone.  The monthly returnee rate last
 year is particularly notable for its sharp
 upward trend.  In January 1965, there
 were 406 returnees; by December the
 number had climbed to 1,482.  In Janu-
 ary 1966, the 1,672 Chieu Hot returnees
 who came back set an alltime record.
 These statistics reflect the impact of U.S.
 Approved For Release 2005/06/29 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000400040012-1
 -.  o  proved For    Mgq?J    9RfiMBP67 March 15,                                                      ftR000400040012-1
 military buildup, upswing of Vietnamese
 morale and the series of GVN-US mili-
 tary successes.  Since JUSPAO psycho-
 logical operations were aimed at rein-
 forcing and exploiting these favorable
 trends, the Chieu Hoi statistics are in
 part a measure of JUSPAO accomplish-
 ment.
 Statistical profile aside, there have also
 been instances of specific reaction to the
 GVN/US psychological operations aimed
 specifically at the Vietcong.
 On October 24, 1965, copies of eight
 different leaflets were airdropped in a
 coordinated psywar campaign into Viet-
 cong strongholds in the IV Corps area.
 In the next week, a check of Vietcong
 defectors indicated that of the 86 coming
 in from the areas covered, 62 carried
 copies of the leaflets dropped on October
 24.  Reacting to other media used, the
 Vietcong in one instance moved into a
 village and removed all anti-Vietcong
 slogans and banners and warned the peo-
 ple not to take part in any demonstra-
 tion being organized as part of the psy-
 war campaign.  Yet in another village,
 as a result of demonstrations held, the
 villagers drew up a letter stressing their
 determination to resist Vietcong pressure.
 The letter was signed by 65 villagers-
 an act of considerable courage since it
 could easily turn into a Vietcong death
 warrant.
 A complete unit defection, that of a
 22-man Vietcong guerrilla platoon oc-
 curred in mid-December 1965, in Binh
 Tuy Province, as a result of a coordi-
 nated  military-psychological  warfare
 operation.  JUSPAO played an active
 role assisting the Vietnamese in carrying
 out the psychological phase which in-
 cluded ground and air loudspeaker oper-
 ations and leaflets.  Wives of. known
 Vietcong were permitted and encouraged
 to cross the frontline positions to con-
 tact their husbands and assure them
 that they would be well treated and that
 they should surrender.  The surrender
 appeals  specified  that the  Vietcong
 should come via roads, with their shirts
 ,il', hands over their heads and' with
 their rifles slung, muzzles pointed down-
 ward.                   Within a week of the operation,
 Vietcong defectors began to come in,
 .isually in two's and three's.  The 22-
 nan platoon, however, brought with
 ;hem 9 rifles and, as a group, followed the
 Ixplicit instructions mentioned above.
 JUSPAO SUPPORT TO SOCIAL REFORM
 Compared to the immediate impact of
 3sywar efforts, the JUSPAO role in sup-
 aort of social improvement and reform
 programs In South Vietnam is, of a
 onger range nature. To assist the Gov-
 ~rnment to win and maintain the loyal-
 ~ies of its people, particularly in rural
 areas, JUSPAO exploits the economic
 and social progress which the GVN with
 AID support has been able to achieve in
 the countryside.  There, military secu-
 rity must precede economic and social
 developmental efforts, but such develop-
 ment is directly related to a favorable
 psychological climate which JUSPAO
 activities aim to create.  This involves
 more than publicizing GVN projects car-
 ried out with AID assistance; it involves
 No. 45--i2
 instilling confidence in the benefits of
 self-help on the part of the villagers as
 well as confidence that the Government
 is sincerely interested in helping the peo-
 ple and in fact is doing so in various
 fields; and of great importance, In help-
 ing the GVN communicate to its people
 its plans for a social revolution.
 Media products on AID activities are
 produced by JUSPAO for use not only
 in Vietnam but-through USIS posts-
 in many third countries as well. A series
 of photos packets are periodically sent to
 some 78 USIS posts worldwide for place-
 ment in the indigenous press and period-
 icals; these contain a substantial num-
 ber of AID stories.  Two USIA officers
 are assigned full time to maintain liaison
 with USAID in Saigon; they help develop
 media materials on AID projects and
 facilitate third-country  coverage  of
 these projects.  In motion pictures, the
 JUSPAO biweekly series of news maga-
 zines deals with U.S. aid to South Viet-
 nam, among other topics. And between
 one-third and one-half of the regular
 radio series-produced by JUSPAO in
 the field or USIA in Washington-are
 frequently on AID topics; such as, round-
 table discussion on economic develop-
 ment programs, documentary coverage
 of AID projects, interviews with "un-
 common people," among whom are AID
 technicians and experts.
 AID stories and articles on agricul-
 tural hints and self-help projects are
 featured prominently in the JUSPAO
 mass-circulating magazine, Rural Spirit.
 A monthly magazine written in simple
 language designed principally for a peas-
 ant audience in support of the GVN
 rural construction program, Rural Spirit
 is distributed in 350,000 copies per issue.
 The Vietnamese edition of Free World
 magazine also carries the story of eco-
 nomic development and nation building
 to a more sophisticated audience of
 school  teachers  and  students.  Its
 monthly circulation is 235,000 copies.
 POSTSCRIPT  .
 As James Reston wrote in the New
 York Times of February 18, 1966:
 Vietnam is the first American war ? +
 fought with the television cameras right on
 the battlefield.                                        The advantages are obvious.
 These * * * scenes of our men under fire
 are taking some of the silly romance out of
 war, but inevitably they portray only one
 side of the story.
 The Vietnam struggle is indeed many
 sided. The material herein represents a
 quick review of some aspects of the U.S.
 nonmilitary effort in South Vietnam, in
 which USIA is directly and intimately
 involved.
 INCREASE DAIRY PRICE SUPPORTS
 (Mr. KASTENMEIER (at the request
 of Mr. PucINsxx) was granted permission
 to extend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. KASTENMEIER.  Mr. Speaker, I
 have introduced a bill today to amend
 the Agricultural Act of 1949 to give the
 Department of Agriculture the addi-
 tional authority it needs to increase
 dairy support levels.
 5623
 The falloff in milk output, which be-
 gan last year, has hastened the disap-
 pearance of a national surplus that al-
 ready was dwindling.  The total milk
 production for 1965 fell to some 125 bil-
 lion pounds, a drop of 11/2  percentage
 points from the 1964 level. The January
 1966 figures indicate an even more
 drastic decline.  The reports for that
 month show that the total U.S. milk pro-
 duction fell 5.3 percent below the year
 ago level.  The decline was far more
 alarming in the top two milk producing
 States-a 7-percent drop in Wisconsin,
 the No. 1 producing State, and a 14-per-
 cent decline in the No. 2 producer, Min-
 nesota.
 The Department of Agriculture's count
 of the Nation's dairy herd reported a
 January total of 16.6 million.  This is
 5.6 percent less than the previous year
 and the largest year-to-year percentage
 decline on record.
 The current dairy price support is 75
 percent of parity-some $3.24 a hundred
 for 3.7 milk.  This price has been in
 effect since April 1, 1965.  A new support
 level will be announced for the new mar-
 kei</div></div></div>  </div>
