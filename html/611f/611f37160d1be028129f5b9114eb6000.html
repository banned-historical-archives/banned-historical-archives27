1552 SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES 
Mr. MORRIS. And you reside now in Washington, D. C., do you not? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, sir. 
Mr. MORRIS. When did come to the United States? 
The INTERPRETER. May the 4th, 1956. 
Mr. MORRIS. Were you an official of the Polish Communist Govern-
ment? 
The INTERPRETER. Until 1951, I was employed by the Polish Govern-
ment, in Poland. After 1951, I was assigned to the Polish Communist 
Party. 
Mr. Moms. And when did you leave the Polish Communist Party? 
The INTERPRETER. The 31st of January 1956. 
Mr. MORRIS. What happened on that c ccasion ? 
The INTERPRETER. I passed from East Berlin to West Berlin on that 
day. 
Mr. MORRIS. Did you at that time defect from the Polish Communist 
Government? 
The INTERPRETER. I left Poland in the middle of January. I went 
to East Berlin and then I left East Berlii for the West. And I was a 
member of the official Polish delegation to East Berlin. 
Senator BUTLER. Will you ask him what his duties were with the 
Polish Government? 
The INTERPRETER. Until 1951 I had hading political positions in 
the Polish militia. 
Mr. Moms. Will you tell us what they were? 
The INTERPRETER. My last position was the Chief of the Political 
Division of the Headquarters of the Polish Militia. 
Mr. MORRIS. Will you tell us why you made your decision to defect 
on January 31, 1956? 
The INTERPRETER. I came to a firm conclusion that all this that I 
was doing for the long 15 years was unjust, bad, and I wanted to 
break relations with all this. 
Mr. Moms. You say it was unjust and bad? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, sir. 
Mr. MORRIS. Was there anything more you would like to tell us about 
your decision to defect? 
The INTERPRETER. I would tell you the re are four main reasons for 
my decision. The first one is the political reason. I came to a conclu-
sion, on the basis as an eyewitness, that the Communist system is con-
trary to all rules of democracy. The second reason was an economic 
reason. From the economic point of view, I could see that the system 
is contrary to economic justice. 
There was also a moral reason. Communist morality is contrary to 
human nature, and I came to that conclusion. 
And then came also ideological reasons. I saw that the Communist 
theory and Communist practice do not go together, that the practice 
defies the theory, and I saw it. 
It means that the theory does not agree with the facts. 
Mr. MORRIS. I wonder if you could tell us, Mr. Bialer, whether those 
are the four elements that prompted you to defect. 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, sir. 
Mr. Monras. I wonder if you would teL us what positions you had 
in the Polish Communist Party dating down to January 31, 1956.

SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES 1553 
The INTERPRETER. I was employed by the Central Committee of the 
Polish Communist Party in the propaganda division. 
In that propaganda division I was one of the chiefs of the anti-
Western and anti-American propaganda. 
I was also a lecturer for the Central Committee. 
I was the first secretary in the party organization to the two most 
important Communist schools in Poland. 
I was also an ideological adviser to the official leading Communist 
paper in Poland, the People's Tribune. 
I also contributed to other papers in Poland. 
I was also a professor of the Institute of Social Sciences at the 
Central Committee of the Communist Party., and also I worked as 
a research worker in the Institute of Economic Sciences of the Polish 
Academy of Science. 
Mr. MORRIS. I wonder if you would tell us briefly how you carried 
on the campaign of propaganda against the West, and particularly 
against the United States. 
The INTERPRETER. There were many ways. The first one: I wrote 
articles on different subjects. Secondly, I delivered very, very many 
lectures in Poland. Thousands of people were listening to me. 
Then I was the author of instructions to the party workers, how 
should they carry on anti-American and anti-Western propaganda in 
Poland. 
From time to time I had meetings with the Communists from other 
countries behind the Iron Curtain. We exchanged views, and also I 
would give them advice as to how carry on this type of propaganda. 
Mr. MORRIS. Now, Mr. Bialer, have you prepared a summary of your 
experiences in Poland for the purposes of givmg advice on the psycho-
logical warfare campaign for the Free Europe Committee? 
The INTERPRETER. You have in mind, sir, this document you have in 
your hand? 
Mr. MORRIS. Yes; The Declaration of a Former Communist. 
The INTERPRETER. I wrote it in Polish. 
Mr. MORRIS. You wrote it in Polish? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, sir. 
Mr. MORRIS. And it has been translated into English? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, Sir. 
Mr. MoRms. And you prepared this particularly on psychological 
warfare; is that right? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, sir. 
Mr. MORRIS. I see. Did you do that on behalf of the Free Europe 
Committee? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, sir. 
May I smoke? 
Mr. MORRIS. Pardon? 
The INTERPRETER. May I smoke? 
Mr. MORRIS. Yes, by all means. 
And this was prepared, then, during the month of May, was it 
not? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, sir. 
Mr. Moult's. Since you arrived in the United States? 
Now, are all the statements in there truthful statements? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, sir.

THE DECLARATION OF A FORMITi COMMUNIST 
At the end of January last when I was breaking with Communism once and 
for all, and crossing the border into West Berlin, I knew that I was wiping out 
my past life. I took this step with my eyes open, however, after carefully 
deliberating for several months. 
I was 15 in 1942 when I enrolled in the Communist underground organization 
in Lodz. I was trained by the Party and trained others to be loyal to it. Sev-
eral thousand PZPR activists in Warsaw, Lodz, Wroclaw, Bydgoszcz, Kielce, 
and other cities know me from the lectures and briefings I held as a lecturer 
appointed by the Central Committee of the P Arty. Readers of Party publi-
cations also know me well from my articles. My colleagues at the Social Science 
Institute and the Central Committee's school of Marxism-Leninism?where I was 
Secretary of the Party authorities?also know ne well. I am known to Party 
members from various other institutions and ucholarly positions, as well as 
propaganda posts with which I was associated. I owe all of these people an 
explanation: Why did I break with the Party? Why did I stop believing in 
Communism?

SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES 1555 
The Communist system Is Antidemocratic 
They know perfectly well that I did not escape to the West to secnre a job or 
to make a career because all this was secured for me by the Party, and open to 
me in Poland. 
Shortly after the war, at the age of 19, I became head of the Political Depart-
ment at the Citizens' Militia Training Center and after that I advanced swiftly. 
When I was leaving Poland, I belonged to the Central Committee Party aktiv 
and the Party leadership had complete trust in me. As a result of the duties 
I was charged with and the posts I occupied, I had access to materials, facts, 
and documents which are often inaccessible to the majority of Party activists, 
not to speak of the rank and file and the general public. As a result, I could 
gradually acquaint myself with the truth and more and more discover the 
fraudulence and the evil. For a very long time I thought that poverty, waste, 
terror, and falsehood were the inevitable price every revolution has to pay for 
progress. Having been for many years active in the Party I was thoroughly 
familiar with its working methods, its system of government, and I arrived at 
the conclusion that it was an antidemocratic system which could not exist with-
out poverty, waste, and falsehood. 
The Dictator Died but the Dictatorship Remains 
Why did this change of attitude toward Communism take place in me during 
the last, post-Stalin period? Because I saw them with a particular intensity 
and became convinced that the evil connected with Communism does not arise 
from individual mistakes, but from the Communist system itself. The dictator's 
death had to bring about certain changes in the shape of the dictatorship, both 
in Russia and in the captive countries. However, as I learned from the experi-
ence of the past three years in Poland, that did not mean the disappearance of 
the dictatorship itself. The Membership of the Politburo has changed, and per-
haps will continue to change, but its omnipotence has remained, as has the 
symbol of its power and dictatorship, the First Secretary of the Central Com-
mittee, Edward Ochab, who took Bierut's place after his death, and is notorious 
for the brutal Stalinist methods he uses. 
I was particularly struck by the fact that the same people who blamed Stalin 
and Beria for everything bad simultaneously practiced the use of the same 
Stalinist and Beria-like methods as much as they could. What is more, when 
it is deemed necessary, they restore these methods, fighting openly and secretly 
against any pronounced attempts at the democratization of Party and national 
life. 
I shall give you at least one example. At the end of 1952, at the Politburo 
office, I was shown a letter which the Presidium of the Communist Party of 
the Soviet Union had written to Soviet Party activists explaining the way Berta 
had been liquidated. One of the reasons for the Beria purge was his alleged 
attempt to get into contact with Tito and the Yugoslav Party. A year later, 
the same Khrushchev who had signed the above-mentioned letter to the Party 
activists, went to Belgrade to win Marshal Tito over and to ask his forgiveness, 
making Beria responsible then for Tito's excommunication. It told me that 
Khrushchev and company were lighting for power against their antagonists by 
the same methods Stalin had used, though externally their methods might seem 
different. I also ascertained irrefutably that the Party leadership continued to 
disclose and condemn only those crimes and dark pages of Communist history 
which could not be kept secret, or which had to be disclosed because it was 
necessary for the leadership. They continued to treat the rank and file of the 
Party, not to mention the people at large, as an object of their rule, and to 
suppress the truth about the ninny internal events in the Party, and most of the 
problems discussed by its leaders. How can one explain otherwise the 
paradoxical fact that the resolutions of the III Plenum were not published, 
though the Plenum was allegedly an epoch-making event aimed at the 
democratization and gradual revelation of Party activities in Poland? 
The Party Leadership Fears the Progress of the Thaw 
As an activist and employee of the Central Committee, I took part in the 
debates in the Central Party &cam I had access to many documents and I know 
the way comrades from the Politburo tried to smother and suppress the so-called 
"thaw" because they were panic-stricken by its results. I also know what a 
farce Rokzanski and his comrades' trial was. I know how passionately Berman,

Poland--Radkiewicz, for example?and how they tried to make them suffer as 
little as possible. 
For several years I was particularly closely ccnnected with the ideological work 
of the Party. In this work I was in touch with the leading Marxists in Russia 
and the Soviet bloc countries. I devoted many years to the study of Marxist-
Leninist ideology and finally concluded that in the Communist version of it, real 
freedom of scientific research is impossible. The repudiation of some of the 
theoretical theses formulated by Stalin by the present Russian Communist leaders 
does not change anything because the head of the Party continues to be the 
highest and virtually infallible scientific oracle in all matters of economics, 
philosophy, history, agronomy, and many other branches of knowledge. ( Stalin's 
place has now been taken by that noteworthy personality, from the intellectual 
and scholarly point of view, Nikita I Sergeyevitch Khrushchev, called Nikita 
Kukuruznik by the Party activists themselves.) 
The fact that in 1955, long after the old tyrant's death, during the rule of the 
new and allegedly democratic party authorities in Russia, a ban was placed on 
discussion of the main problem of economic policy, I mean the problem of the 
relation between development of heavy industrial production and consumer 
goods production, in Russia and all the captive countries. Fearing that we might 
discuss these problems, we, the workers of the Party's ideological front and 
Intellectual activists, were instructed to limit ourselves to writing essays which 
would merely explain the official Party line on the priority development of 
heavy industry. 
Facts Are Against Communism' 
One of my Party assignments was to prepa?Te guidances for the propaganda 
policy aimed at the West. I had, therefore, access to materials, facts, and statis-
tics which are carefully kept secret from the Party and the general public. On 
the basis of those materials I became convinced that both Communist theory 
and practice are false because they are conttadicted by the facts. They are 
contradicted by the improvement of the situation of the working classes in the 
West, and by the poverty in the Communist cot ntries. Taking part in the work 
of various institutions and in various scholarly posts, I was able to acquaint 
myself with the methods of falsification, embellishment, and suppression of data 
and statistics concerning the standard of living in Poland, and with the methods 
of garbling Western statistics for Communist propaganda purposes. 
Step by step I learned the truth and lost faith in Communism. I had to lie, 
pretend, and play a double game. Finally, I arrived at the conclusion that I 
was unable to live that way any longer, that 1: was better to erase 15 years of 
wasted life than to continue to live without faith that what I was doing was 
right. 
These are the reasons I broke with Communism. That is why I gave up bril-
liant prospects in the Party and took the decisive step which was so difficult 
for personal reasons. That is why I crossed the Western border, so that I 
could freely and openly tell what I know about the facts the Communist leader-
ship tries to suppress, so that I can tell what I know about Communist theory 
and practice. 
? ? ? 
BERTA'S CASE 
In March 1953, greatly impressed by Stalin': death, I listened together with 
other Party members to the speeches that Berk Malenkov, and Molotov gave in 
Moscow's Red Square. They all spoke of the in lexible unity of the Party leader-
ship and promised to guard that leadership unity constantly. I believed them 
then and listened to their speeches with great emotion. 
However, before four months had elapsed, [ was taken aback by the com-
munique about Beria's arrest and next about his purge. The official explanation 
In the press filled me with serious doubts. 
In the autumn of 1953, at the office of the PZPR Politburo, I was given a secret 
letter from the Soviet Party Presidium to the Party aktiv in Russia. The letter 
explained the reasons that made Beria's purge necessary. Besides myself, some 
other chosen members of the Central Party (citify were allowed to read the 
letter. Afterwards, it was probably return to the PZPR Politburo's safe where 
it probably still lies under Ochab's vigilant eye. 
I read this letter with great interest. I had no illusions whatsoever as to 
Beria's role as Security Police chief. On the other hand, I realized that many

SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES 1557 
official reasons for his liquidation had been invented and did not apply exalt-
sively to him. That's why I was curious about whether in a letter reserved for 
a small group of the most trusted comrades I would find some explanation for 
my doubts. However, the contents of the letter, instead of dispelling my doubts, 
increased them even further. The letter repeated many of the charges I knew 
from the communique in the newspapers. Thus, Beria was accused of having 
transformed the security apparatus into an organ independent of the Party. 
There was also the same charge about Beria's mistakes in his nationalities policy, 
especially with respect to the small nations in the Soviet Union. Even the absurd 
charge about Beria's having been a spy and an imperialist agent, recruited in 
1918, was repeated. 
Beria Surrounds Other Politburo Members with Spies 
In addition to those well-known charges, there were other accusations. Thus, 
Beria was accused of using the security apparatus in the struggle for power 
within the Soviet Politburo. I remember that this charge was corroborated, 
among other things, by the fact that Beria had seized control of the Kremlin 
guards and with their help had organized surveillance and wiretapping of the 
conversations of the other Politburo members. The second fact quoted in the let-
ter was even more typical. It was maintained that when one of the Politburo 
members was leaving for Lwow, Berta summoned the head of the NKVD in Lwow 
and ordered him to put the member under surveillance in Lwow. When the head 
of the Lwow NKVD expressed his surprise that such an order could be issued 
about a Politburo member, Beria reminded him what refusal to execute his order 
would entail, and said?I remember the phrase very clearly: "If you don't carry 
out my orders, I shall crush you into labor camp dust." In spite of that, the 
NKVD agent from Lwow was so shocked that he immediately called upon other 
Politburo members to tell them about Beria's order. 
Other charges in the letter referred to economic matters. They were very 
numerous and I want to mention them here only briefly. Among other things, 
Beria was accused of having hampered the development of agriculture by his 
influence in the Politburo. Besides, Beria was also accused of having consistently? 
hindered the policy of raising the standard of living of the working classes by 
opposing any lowering of prices. 
The Amoral Profile of Beria 
The Soviet Politburo letter also said that Beria was a moral degenerate in his 
private life. As proof, the following facts were listed. It was maintained that 
Beria had a special apartment in Moscow where he organized erotic orgies in 
selected company. On his orders, specially chosen women were brought from 
the Moscow prisons. According to the letter, these women were later liquidated 
in labor camps. Beria also forced other women he liked to take part in those 
orgies. When he grew bored with them, they were arrested and sent to special 
labor camps. 
The letter also said that Beria had appropriated authorship of the book called 
The History of the Bolshevik Organization in Transcaucasia, whose authors he 
had shot. According to the letter, the book contained many historical falsehoods 
which exaggerated Beria's role. This charge was particularly interesting to me 
because Beria's book was one of the official manuals of the history of the Bolshe-
vik Party used in the Party training which I myself had organized in Poland. 
Nor did the list of charges end there. The letter maintained that Beria had 
persecuted the family of the dead Party leader Ordjonikidze because he had been 
one of the first to suspect Beria and to mistrust him. After Ordjonikidze's death, 
Beria transferred his hatred to his family, persecuting and destroying it. 
Who Performed the Murders in Leningrad? 
From the letter on Beria I also learned for the first time officially about the so-
called Leningrad Affair. The Politburo accused Beria of having conducted a 
policy of liquidation of people devoted and loyal to the Communist Party simply 
because they were devoted and loyal. The "Leningrad Affair" was an example 
where in a series of secret trials, the flower of the political aktiv of Leningrad was 
liquidated. According to the letter, the material evidence in those trials had been 
fabricated by Beria. 
It is very possible that Berta was actually one of the men who organized the 
Leningrad trials. But I understood the perfidy of this accusation only later, in 
February 1955, when I read another Politburo letter explaining Malenkov's dis-
missal. In that letter, I found, among other things, a charge that Malenliov was

1558 SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES 
also responsible for the organization of the Leningrad trials. I then came to the 
conclusion that Khrushchev, aiming at seizure of power in the Party, had adopted 
the tactics of removing his rivals one by one. As long as it was necessary, he, 
together with Malenkov, accused Beria of stagbig the Leningrad trials. Eighteen 
months later, when Malenkov's turn came, Khr ishchey made him coresponsible. 
Beria Wanted, but Khrushchev Went . . . 
The most perfidious charges in the letter, against the background of the present 
Party line, were the charges that the proof cf Beria's work as an imperialist 
agent was in his attempts after Stalin's death to get In touch with Tito and the 
Yugoslav Party. According to the Politburo letter, the Yugoslav Party was a 
fascist and anti-Soviet Party. I even remember a certain detail in connection 
with that charge. Berta was accused of having tried to make direct telephone 
contact with Belgrade for private talks with the Yugoslav leaders. The question 
was about reopening a direct telephone line which had been cut off between the 
Kremlin and Belgrade after Yugoslavia's expulsion from the Cominform. 
The perfidy of this charge appeared to me only much later. When Khrushchev 
went to Belgrade and when the new Politburo policy toward Yugoslavia was an-
nounce& I remembered that part of the letter which had accused Beria of trying 
to establish relations with a fascist and anti-Soviet Yugoslav Party. On one 
hand, Khrushchev blamed Beria for having broken off relations with Tito and 
Yugoslavia and, on the other, he accused him and indicted him for having at-
tempted to reestablish those relations. 
At the end of the letter, the Soviet Politburo asked the question: "Why was 
Berta so rapidly unmasked after Stalin's death?" The letter gave the following 
answer: the Soviet Politburo could unmask him so soon because Beria became 
domineering and reckless after Stalin's death. lie made careless moves and thus 
enabled the Politburo to unmask him as an imperialist agent. In this way the 
Soviet Politburo gave one to understand that before Stalin's death It had not 
known of Beria's criminal activities, but it had discovered them only in the 
past two or three months and therefore was not responsible for Beria's past 
activities. 
Further the letter explained that in investigating Beria's hostile activities 
and in its fight against him, the Politburo had to be very careful since any rash 
step would have aroused his suspicions., While being aware of Beria's criminal 
activities, the Politburo had to pretend that It did not suspect him of anything. 
Because of this, it had to accept certain of Berin's moves though it did not agree 
with them. The letter gives as an example thE question of the policy line pre-
ceding the Berlin riots in June 1953. In it, th o Soviet Politburo declared that 
the policy imposed by Bella on the Soviet authorities in East Germany, and on 
the political leadership of the German Democratic Republic, which resulted in 
the June riots, was false. The Soviet Politburo was aware of the fact that the 
policy being conducted in East Germany was 12 error, but could not oppose it 
because it did not want Berta to guess that he was suspected of being a spy. 
Khrushchev Uses Stalin's and Beria's Methods 
Such were the contents of the secret letter of the Presidium of the CPSU to the 
political aktiv in Russia. This letter was one of the documents which helped 
to evaluate the situation properly. Not immediately, of course, but later, when 
I compared other Khrushchev moves with the letter's charges about Beria, I 
became profoundly convinced that both the secret trial and the fabrication of 
certain of the charges in Beria's purge were typical of the methods both Stalin 
and Berta had applied. And the responsibility for those methods could not be 
fixed only on Beria or Stalin. After the letter about Malenkov, after Khrush-
chers visit to Belgrade, and after the July Plen am last year, it became clear to 
me that in large measure Khrushchev was fighting for power with the same 
methods as Berta and Stalin had used. I also ci me to the conclusion that there 
was no difference between the trials organized by Stalin and Berta, and Beria's 
trial, insofar as trumping up charges or in the methods of conducting the trial 
Itself.

MALENICOV FORCED To RESIGN: KIIRITSF/CIEEV DEGRADES MALENBOV 
After Beria's purge the next step in the power 8truggle inside the Soviet Polit-
buro was Malenkov's forced resignation. Before it happened we had a period 
of awakened hopes. After the Beria affair, some changes were introduced into

SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES 1559 
the Party leadership system. The question of the improvement of the standard of 
living was considered the most important task. I must state that in 1954 I 
myself and a considerable number of the Party activists really believed that the 
power struggle in the Soviet Politburo was over. We believed that after Beria's 
removal, the highest Soviet leadership was united. 
Yet, in February 1955, the news of Malenkov's removal came like a thunder-
clap. It shocked the entire Party aktiv: we knew immediately that the struggle 
in the Politburo continued. We were indignant at the way in which Malenkov 
had been removed, rather like a schoolboy, and not like the Premier of a great 
country which was considered as a model democracy. Finally, we thought that 
the official reasons for Malenkov's dimissal in which we were asked to believe, 
and which we were asked to tell others, were ridiculous. 
Bierut and Ochab Said Only One Thing: Obey the Moscow Politburo 
We turned for an answer to our doubt to the PZPR leadership, to Bierut, Ber-
man, and Ochab. They had only one answer for us, however: we must trust the 
Soviet Party Presidium completely. Moreover, they attempted to cut short all 
discussion of the subject. I remember, for example, that in February 1955, at 
one of the Party meetings at the Institute of Social Sciences of the Central Party 
Committee, I was sitting next to Berman and expressed my doubts about Malen-
kov's resignation. Berman answered with phrases about full confidence, and 
greatly agitated cut off further discussion. 
When, shortly thereafter, at the Politburo office, I was given a Soviet Commu-
nist Party Presidium letter to the Soviet Party alctiv, concerning Malenkov this 
time, I wondered whether I would find an answer there to the questions that 
haunted me?and I found it. 
Because up to today, the reasons for Malenkov's removal have not been given 
to the Russian people, or to the Party, or to the Polish people, I would like to 
tell about the contents of that letter. These are the reasons mentioned in the 
confidential letter, not those given in the press, which were so absurd that no 
one could believe them. I shall enumerate them one by one. 
The Main Emphasis Was Not Farming and the Farmer's Life, but Power " 
The first charge concerned Malenkov's responsibility for serious errors in his 
farm policy. This accusation was already known to me from Malenkov's state-
ment explaining his resignation. In the Soviet Politburo letter the charge was 
amplified. It was said that Malenkov was in charge of farm policy. The state 
of farming in the Soviet Union was alarming, and Malenkov was chiefly respon-
sible for this state of affairs. 
When I read those charges, the following questions came to my mind. First, 
if Malenkov were responsible for the farm crisis, what could we say about 
Khrushchev who had for many years been Party Secretary in the Ukraine, 
the granary of the Soviet Union? Secondly, if Malenkov knew so little about 
agriculture, what could be said about his successor, Bulganin, who, as I learned 
from his biography, had never had anything to do with farming? Thirdly, if 
Malenkov were little acquainted with agriculture, he knew even less about electric 
power stations, and yet in spite of it, he had been appointed minister of electric 
power stations. Finally, the first steps which, in the opinion of Khrushchev 
and the entire Politburo, were to change the farm situation completely had already 
been taken under Malenkov. Therefore, it was not Malenkov who was preventing 
implementation of agrarian reforms. Consequently, the question of farming 
was not involved. My suspicion was subsequently confirmed when, in spite of 
Malenkov's resignation, no really new resolutions on farm questions were 
announced. 
What also struck me was that Beria was also accused of being responsible 
for the farm crisis. This coincidence of charges being brought against Berth. 
and Malenkov became even more striking when I read the rest of the letter. I 
shall write of it later in connection with the coresponsibility for the "Leningrad 
Affair." 
Light Industry?No! 
Before coming to that matter, I should like to mention other charges brought 
against Malenkov in the Soviet Politburo's confidential letter. Attention was 
drawn to the danger caused by Malenkov's policy to the regular development 
of the People's Democracies. This charge was formulated cautiously, and like 
the entire letter, briefly. Such a policy, as conducted by Malenkov, could bring 
about a decrease of economic effort in the People's Democracies. I understood

1560 SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES 
then immediately what it was all about. At that time, there was great interest 
in the Polish Party in the developments in Hungary after Imre Nagy had come 
to power. During that period, Hungary abandoned the principle of stressing 
heavy industry at any price and by any means. Not only I, but many other 
people, saw in it a great relief for the Hungarian people. During this period, 
pressure was brought to bear on the Party leadership in Poland by the aktiv 
to follow the Hungarian example more resolutely in establishing the relation 
between heavy industry and consumer goods production so that the standard of 
living could be raised. 
This pressure was firmly resisted by the Party leadership. They were at 
that time greatly displeased by the Hungarian comrades who were making the 
situation in Poland more difficult. I remember especially well that Szyr was 
furious when some of the activists maintained that Hungarian economic policy 
was more sensible than Polish. 
Shortly after Malenkov's removal, even before I had occasion to read the 
Soviet Politburo's letter, I learned about Imre Nagy's dismissal and that is why, 
when I read in the letter than Malenkov had been accused of endangering the 
orderly development of the People's Democracies, I understood how this charge 
was justified from the Soviet Politburo viewpoint. Malenkov had, in fact, con-
ducted a policy which might have brought some measure of relief in the economic 
situations of the captive countries. In the long run, however, this would mean an 
increase in the independence of those countries and with such a policy, Khrush-
chev and the rest of the Politburo could not agree. Besides, during Rhrushchey's 
stay in Poland in the spring of 1955, I could personally ascertain it from listening 
to his very aggressive and unpublished speeches. 
The next charge in the letter concerned Malenkov's incorrect attitude toward 
developing heavy industry, which was closely connected with what I have said 
before. When I read the Soviet Politburo's letUer, I was struck by the fact that 
Malenkov was actually accused of deviation from Stalinism, for one of Stalin's 
fundamental economic principles was priority of heavy industry and maintenance 
of a steady difference of tempo between heavy industrial and consumer goods 
industry development. The simple conclusion occurred to me that whatever is 
convenient in Stalinism to the present Party leadership will, without fail, be 
maintained. I also remember that during that time there were numerous dis-
cussions of economic policy, of the ratio between heavy industry and consumer 
goods industry, in the Party, and after Malenl:ov's dismissal, these discussions 
were severely forbidden. 
And so Malenkov's Turn Came. Who Next? 
Finally, there was yet another charge which gave me much to think about in 
that confidential letter. The Soviet Politburo accused Malenkov of a concilia-
tory attitude toward Beria and of coresponsibility for the "Leningrad trials." 
The charge was formulated as follows: during the period of struggle against 
Beria, Malenkov adopted a conciliatory attitude toward him and was, moreover, 
coresponsible for the "Leningrad Affair." I noted immediately that this charge 
was identical with one of the charges made against Beria, though formulated in 
a less emphatic way, the charges on which the purge of I3eria had been based. 
Yet, I thought, Malenkov had been Khrushchey's aide when Belga was purged. 
Still another question occurred to me. Why wasn't Malenkov accused of it in 
those days. The answer was clear enough. Malenkov was indispensable in the 
fight against Beria, and his turn had not yet come. 
In this way the "Leningrad Affair" and the crisis in agriculture were exploited 
by Khrushchev twice in order to rid himself of his two most important rivals. 
This tested method of removal was applied 135 Khrushchev, as I was to learn 
later, with great success. When Molotov was removed in July, I remembered 
that at the same session of the Supreme Soviet at which Malenkov had been 
forced to resign, Molotov had given a speech on foreign policy. In that speech, 
he had expressed the same views on the Yugo-nay problem as those for which 
he was later severely criticized at the July Plenum. He had also then formulated 
the same thesis with respect to the stage of development of communism in Russia 
which he was publicly asked to withdraw. 
But Molotov's mistakes were tolerated by Khrushchev at that time. The reason 
was obvious: Molotov's help was necessary to force Malenkov's resignation. In 
February, Molotov was still indispensable to Khrushchev, as Malenkov had been 
Indispensable during the purge of Berta in July 1953. Molotov's turn came at 
the July Plenum last year. . . .

SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES 1561 
How KIIRUSFICHEV CARRIED OUT MOLOTOV'S POLITICAL DEMOTION 
The third step in Khrushchev's showdown with his Politburo rival was to 
remove Molotov from all influence on political affairs in the Party leadership. 
This took place last July at the Plenum. How did it come about? 
In July 1955 the Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU was held. 
The materials connected with the Plenum filled the Soviet and Polish press 
for several days; they were the subject of discussions and official training in 
the PZPR. The subject discussed at the Plenum, at least what one could judge 
from the materials, was the question of introducing new technical methods into 
Soviet industry. Bulganin made a speech. I remember I considered a positive 
thing that all the speeches of the participants had been published, a rare thing 
at Russian plena and even at Polish ones. The discussion was not secret and 
in many cases was very lively. 
True, I found it odd that in view of such important events in the international 
arena as Khrushchev's and Bulganin's visit to Belgrade, the Austrian problem, 
and the Geneva Conference, no foreign policy problems were discussed at the 
Plenum. However, I did not attach great importance to it. It did not occur 
to me that so early after Malenkov's removal, new personal showdowns were in 
the making. Besides, it was a period of intensification of the "thaw" in Poland, 
and these problems occupied my attention completely. 
Three months passed and the questions connected with the July Plenum were 
slowly forgotten. The problems of the Plenum ceased to be discussed at train-
ing centers. But in October Bierut suddenly called a meeting of the members 
of the Central Committee, and a part of the Central Party alotiv. When we 
gathered on the 6th floor of the building of the Central Committee, Bierut got 
up and told us that the July Plenum besides its public part had had a secret 
and unpublished part. In a short talk Bierut informed us of some of the matters 
which had been discussed in the secret part of the July Plenum. Our meeting 
was strictly confidential. I remember Bierut told us that we could not make 
notes. 
Bierut's brief information was later passed on, even more briefly, to certain 
groups of the Party aktiv in Warsaw, and Jerzy Morawski reported on the 
secret part of the Plenum to the lecturers of the Central Committee. For my 
part, I made a report on those matters to Party schools and again it was under-
stood that no notes could be taken. Also, attendance at the meeting was closely 
checked on the basis of a list and Party identity cards. No questions or dis-
cussion were permitted; in short, the material was treated as strictly confi-
dential. But it all became clear to me when I read a stenographic record of the 
secret part of the Plenum. 
A few days after the meeting with Bierut in the Politburo office, they gave me 
the full stenographic record of the July Plenum to read. It was the only copy 
sent to Poland for the use of the Polish Politburo. Only a very small number 
of the members of the Party aktiv were permitted to read it. The record was 
very long. The Plenum had lasted 8 days and some of the speeches several 
hours, so I shall only deal with some of the problems discussed at the Plenum. 
The Third Step in the Career of the Collective Leadership: Khrushchev 
What was the chief subject of the secret part of the July Plenum? After 
reading the record carefully I saw that it concerned itself chiefly with the show-
down between Khrushchev and the rest of the Soviet Politburo on one hand, 
and Molotov on the other. The secret part of the July Plenum was, therefore, 
the third step in clearing the way for the so-called collective leadership, therefore. 
for Khrushchev. 
What was the platform of this showdown? The Yugoslav issue. The prob-
lem of the attitude of the Soviet Communist Party toward Marshal Tito and the 
Yugoslav Party. But it would not be fair to restrict the discussion to Tito' 
case. The fact is that the question of Yugoslav relations was only a point of 
departure for a long discussion of political and economic problems. I shall 
enumerate only the most important ones. 
A good deal of space was given to a discussion of coexistence with the 
capitalist countries, to the problem of political relations between the Russian 
Party and the Parties of the People's Democracies, to the problem of diplomatic 
relations with the People's Democracies. The question of the underdeveloped 
countries was also discussed, and the attitude toward Socialist Parties in the 
West, and the attitude toward Stalinism. However, the most important subject, 
and the basis for the showdown with Molotov, was the Yugoslav problem.

1562 SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN TEIE UNITED STATES 
What follows is based on the shorthand minutes af the secret part of the Plenum 
about the showdown itself. 
In February, at the Supreme Soviet meeting, Molotov's attitude had already 
been different from the line taken toward the Yugoslav problem by Khrushchev 
and most of the other Politburo members, and this became clear to me, and to 
the majority of the Political akar when we heard of the Khrushchev-Bulganin 
visit to Belgrade. In February, however, Khrushchev did not attack Molotov 
because he needed him in the showdown with Malenkov. This is proved by 
the fact that the Soviet Politburo permitted his official address to the Supreme 
Soviet to express views which opposed, those o-! the majority of the Politburo. 
Yet there is no doubt that the texts of such speeches are scrupulously ap-
proved by the Politburo, and primarily by the First Party Secretary before 
they are made. 
From the stenographic record of the secret part of the Plenum, it seemed 
that preparations for Molotov's removal began immediately after Malenkov's 
resignation. In the spring of last year, the Politburo held a meeting at which 
Molotov was criticized as Minister of Foreign Affairs for his attitude toward 
the Yugoslav problem and several other international problems. Molotov was 
accused of having hampered the reestablishing of Soviet-Yugoslav relations by 
all means. 
Khrushchev and Molotov Battle Over Tito 
Before the Khrushchev and Bulganin departure for Belgrade, the Politburo 
held another meeting at which Molotov opponed the visit. Molotov was for 
reestablishing international relations with .!Cugoslavia but, for ideological 
reasons, resisted reestablishment of Party relations with the Yugoslav Com-
munist Party. What he had in mind was not only Khrushchev and Bul-
ganin's visit to Belgrade but also the character of their visit. 
These facts were given by Khrushchev in his opening speech to the secret 
part of the July Plenum. As a result of Politburo discussions, Khrushchev 
continued, Molotov still had not changed his attitude. The disagreement found 
its expression in the adoption of two Politburo resolutions. In one, the ma-
jority of the Politburo recognizes the necessity of the Belgrade visit and the 
necessity of attempting to reconstitute inter-Party relations with Yugoslavia. 
In the second resolution, Molotov's attitude was described, appraised by Khrush-
ehey and the rest of the Politburo, and a dee' sion was taken to put it up for 
discussion at the earliest Plenum of the CC of the CPSU. 
At the July Plenum, Khrushchev once again charged Molotov with having 
prevented the reestablishment of international relations with Yugoslavia, and 
denounced his attitude on this issue as both erroneous and against the Party 
line. 
Molotov Battles And. 
The stenographic record showed that Molo--ov addressed the meeting after 
Khrushchev's speech and explained his viewpoint. However, in the discussion 
which followed and lasted for several days, the Plenum of the CC declared itself 
against Molotov's position. In addition to -Chrushchev, Bulganin, Mikoyan, 
Kaganovich, Susslov, and Shepilov criticized Molotov severely. The discussion 
was accompanied by a series of personal skirmishes, abusive remarks flowed 
freely, and time and again speeches were interrupted. This was particularly 
true of Molotov's speech. 
I shall give an example. When Molotov was explaining his viewpoint that 
Party problems should not be discussed with Tito because Tito was anti-Soviet 
and his views far removed from Communism Ind rather close to those of anti-
Communists, Khrushchev interrupted him, shouting: "But in 1939 jou could talk 
to Ribbentrop!" Incidentally, it oceurred to me while I was reading the 
minutes that the comparison to Ribbentrop was not very flattering for Tito. 
* * * and Capitulates 
As a result of the violent discussion,: Molotov made a short declaration toward 
the end of the secret meeting, occupying not more than one page of the shorthand 
minutes, in which in an extremely formal manner, he listed Khrushchev's charges 
and admitted that they were well founded. Ile also said that he yielded to the 
Central Committee's view of the Yugoslav problem. His declaration was so 
formal that I had no doubt when I read it that it was only Molotov's attempt 
to save what still could be saved. It was an attempt to take away from 
Khrushchev all the arguments which could be ased for Molotov's dismissal.

SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES 1563 
An Allegedly "Impersonal" Encounter 
The shorthand minutes showed that the discussion was full of Khrushchev's 
personal remarks about Molotov. Khrushchev therefore devoted a great deal 
of space in his closing speech to assurances that there was no question of a 
personal misunderstanding between him and Molotov. Personally, he said he 
had nothing against Molotov: his sole concern was Party matters. These 
assurances were so numerous that I understood them to mean their opposite. 
Besides, even in his closing comments, Khrushchev could not resist making a 
personal remark leveled at Molotov. He said, and I remember that passage 
extremely well, "Vyacheslav Mikhailovitch, all this is your wife's fault. It 
would be much better for you if you didn't listen to her. She pushes you and 
makes you ambitious. She is your evil spirit." 
Such was the general outline of the showdown with Molotov at the secret 
session of the Plenum last July. 
? ? 
THE SOVIET AMBASSADOR TO POLAND IS NOT A DIPLOMAT BTJT A PROCONSUL 
The stenographic of the secret part of the Plenum of the CC of the CPSIT 
also contained many matters which pertained to Poland and Polish-Soviet rela-
tions. The question of the real role of the Soviet Ambassadors to Poland, 
particularly Popov and Lebediev, confirmed a state of affairs I had suspected 
for a long time. The Soviet ambassador in Poland was more a proconsul inter-
fering in the internal affairs of the country than the diplomatic representative 
of a friendly nation. He does not take into account either the feelings of the 
people, or the Party leaders' ambitions. There is, of course, nothing new in this. 
What is new is that it was described in this manner at a. Central Committee 
meeting in Moscow with Khrushchev and Kaganovitch there. 
How was it that the question of the behavior of the Soviet Ambassadors to 
Poland was discussed at the secret meeting of the July Plenum? It so happened 
that Molotov's activity as Minister of Foreign Affairs had already been exam-
ined, and in order to substantiate their criticism of him, Khrushchev, Kagano-
vitch, and others cited facts which either directly or indirectly discredited him. 
Among other things, the activities of the Soviet ambassadors to Poland emerged. 
Long before I read the shorthand minutes of the July Plenum, I heard rumors 
and sometimes even full details which threw light on the real role of the Soviet 
ambassadors to Poland. Besides, I was in personal contact with other Soviet 
inspectors in Poland. Thus, I often met Professor Alexandrov, ideological tutor 
of some of the Polish training schools, Comrade Nietchkina, guardian of the 
Polish philosophers, Professor Kuznainov, who occasionally came from Moscow 
to inspect the Polish economists and their work, Comrade Pankratova, member 
of the Central Committee in Moscow and patron of Polish historians, and many 
others. On the basis of these contacts and seeing their condescending attitude 
toward Poles, I could easily imagine how the Soviet ambassador, whose rank 
was much higher, behaved. But it is quite a different thing to imagine things 
and to find a confirmation of one's suspicions in Khrushchev's or Kaganovitch's 
speeches, and the stepnographic minutes of the July Plenum secret session 
confirmed them amply. 
Kaganovitch Admits that Popov Liked to Give Orders 
At the Plenum Kaganovitch criticized Molotov's activities as Foreign Minister 
and, among other things, appraised the Soviet ambassador's work in Poland. 
Kaganovitch maintained that Popov's behavior was simply inexcusable. What 
was this inexcusable behavior? According to the report, Popov thought he was 
fully entitled to issue orders to the Comrades in the leadership of the Polish 
Party. He grossly interfered in Polish internal affairs. Kaganovitch said that 
Popov was intriguing among the Polish Party leaders and inciting them one 
against the other. Moreover, Popov spoke disparagingly, in the presence of 
Polish comrades, of the Polish Party leadership. Such behavior on the part of a 
Soviet Ambassador to Poland, Kaganovitch said, was inadmissible. 
While I read the above criticisms of the Soviet Ambassador's hehavior by 
Kaganovitch, I involuntarily asked myself the following questions: First, Popov 
became ambassador to Poland in June 1953 and remained at his post until March 
1954. He was, therefore, Ambassador after Stalin's death, after Beria's purge, 
and when Khrushchev was made First Party Secretary, and came to Warsaw on 
72723-57?pt. 29-3

several occasions. It is hard to believe that th 3 Soviet leadership was unaware 
of Popov's behavior, yet in spite of this his activities in Warsaw were tolerated. 
Second, I wondered how meek the PZPIt Politburo was if it had tolerated 
Popov's actions for so long. This same Popov was not even a member of the 
Central Committee of the CPSU. They even tolerated him when they were no 
longer obliged to listen to Stalin's orders. 
But the criticism of the Soviet ambassadors to Poland made at the July Plenum 
was not limited to Popov only. In his closing speech at the secret session of the 
Plenum, Khrushchev violently attacked another Soviet ambassador to Poland, 
Lebiediev. 
Khrushchev Admits That Lebiediev and Popov Are Like Twins 
Commenting on Lebiediev's activities, Khrusi chev used the same expressions 
as Kaganovitch did about Popov. Among other things, Khrushchev maintained 
that Lebiediev took it upon himself to be a leader of political life in Poland, and 
used to summon the highest Polish Party dignitaries to the Soviet Embassy and 
tell them what to do. In addition, Khrushchev accused Liebiediev of having 
written a book on Poland which had already beet sent to be printed, but its publi-
cation was stopped at the last moment. Had it been published it would have done 
irreparable damage to Polish-Soviet relations. Lebiediev had stated in his book, 
among other things, that the bulk of the Polish intelligentsia was fascist. 
Nor was that all, for Khrushchev also said that Lebiediev formulated a funda-
mentally erroneous thesis that the Polish Workers Party had been set up as a 
result of the Soviet offensive on the eastern fro at, and as a result of the great 
Russian victories. And yet, Khrushchev said, the roots of this Party were in 
the Polish people's independent struggle. 
In the light of the stenographic record of the CO's secret session in Moscow, 
it is easy to understand why Khrushchev considered the appearance of Lebiediev's 
book a disaster. The theses contained in it woule have discredited the Soviets in 
the Polish readers' eyes. 
After criticizing the book, Khrushchev returned to Lebiediev's activities in 
Poland, emphasizing that Lebiediev's constant interference in Polish domestic 
matters was revolting and inexcusable. Khrushchev several times pointed out 
that such behavior was inconsistent with the ir structions of the Soviet Party 
leadership. Khrushchev supported this statement with a quotation from the 
Russian Party's CO resolution which forbade ambassadors to interfere in the 
domestic matters of the People's Democracies. What struck me was the fact that 
Lebiediev had been Soviet Ambassador to Poland for seven years and therefore 
had not been complying with CC decisions for some time. In addition, Khru-
shchev also hinted that this type of harmful activity was connected with the past 
and with Beria's times. 
For Breaking Party Resolutions: the Order of Lenin 
This violent Khrushchev criticism of Lebiediev was made at the Plenum in 
July of last year. The minutes of the speech reached Poland in October, but 
almost simultaneously a Moscow Pravda communique reached Warsaw about 
Lebiediev having been awarded the Order of Lenin. It so happened that I read 
that issue of Pravda and the minutes of the Khruahchev speech during the same 
week. Which was I to believe? The Khrushchev who had criticized Lebiediev's 
conduct as Soviet Ambassador to Poland so violently, or the Khrushchev who had 
awarded him the highest Soviet decoration for :neritorious achievements and 
services rendered to the Soviet fatherland? Who was I to believe the Khrush-
chev who accused Lebiediev of violating the Central Committee resolutions or the 
Khrushchev who considered Lebiediev to be a suitable man for the post of Soviet 
Ambassador to Finland?

MIKOYAN ON THE "BROTHERLY 150VIET Am" 
One of the most interesting problems discussed at the secret session of the 
July Plenum in Moscow was the problem of eccnomic relations between the 
Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. Miltoyan devoted a good deal of 
space to that problem in his speech. I read those passages with a good deal of 
interest because I had written a series of articles on those relations for Party 
and economic publications. One of my articles, published in Trybuna Ludu, was 
reprinted in the Cominform paper, For A Lasting Peace, for a People's Democ-
racy. Why do I speak of that now? Because I had closely followed the Party

SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES 1565 
line in my articles, yet when I read Mikoyan's speech I saw that everything 
I had written in those articles was simply a lie. Of course I knew many facts 
which proved that the Soviet Union was taking advantage of many privileges in 
its economic relations with Poland, but only after reading Mikoyan's speech did 
I realize that economic discrimination was applied to all of the captive countries. 
Mikoyan denounced these discriminatory measures and plainly implied that 
It was not exceptional but the general rule. What was this general economic 
discrimination with regard to the captive countries? I shall mention some of 
the examples I found in the stenographic record of the secret session of the 
July Plenum. 
Joint Stock Companies for Exploitation, Not For Help 
The problem Mikoyan discussed particularly extensively was that of the 
so-called mixed companies' activities. Mixed companies were commercial or 
Industrial enterprises set up by the Soviets in almost all the captive countries. 
In such a company there are two partners : the Soviet Union and the People's 
Democracy in which the company operates. According to the statutes of these 
companies, there is complete equality between the two partners. 
In all the variety of forms of so-called Soviet brotherly help extended to the 
People's Democracies, the mixed companies always set up as an example of the 
Soviet Union's sacrifices for its younger brothers. The Romanian Premier 
Gheorghlu-Dej once said that mixed companies were the most efficacious and 
profitable form of Soviet brotherly aid offered to the countries building socialism. 
The mixed companies were given in ideological training as an example of pro-
letarian internationalism. This was the official Party and ideological line. How-
ever, at the secret session of the July Plenum, Mikoyan said that the mixed 
companies were the most conspicuous form of Russian interference in the domes-
tic economic affairs of the People's Democracies. They were, in Mikoyan's 
opinion, a sign of Soviet nationalism, a form of exploitation of weaker countries 
by the U. S. S. R., and they had become an example of economic exploitation of 
the People's Democracies which is why they had to be dissolved. 
Chinese Communists Slap Moscow's Pace 
But the mixed companies were dissolved not only because they were Incon-
sistent with the principle of proletarian internationalism. And Mikoyan him-
self admitted it. Here is a passage of the shorthand minutes which I remember 
particularly well: "Did we need those mixed companies?" Mikoyan asked. 
"Were we very happy when our Comrade Mao Tse-tung put our nose out of joint 
by refusing to allow similar companies to be established in China? Shouldn't 
we draw a lesson from past mistakes and dissolve those companies?" 
Mikoyan then explained in detail how the Soviet nose had been put out of 
joint by Mao Tse-tung. This even took place after Stalin's death when the 
Soviet Union proposed founding such mixed companies to China, for the product-
tion of tropical fruits in China which would then export a certain quantity of 
them to Russia. Mao Tse-tung did not agree to the offer and proposed instead 
that China export tropical fruits on a normal commercial basis. Thus, Mao 
gave a very eloquent appraisal of the mixed companies' activities from the point 
of view of Chinese interests. 
The Negro Did the Job and Was Sent Away With Praise 
In my opinion, these experiences explain why it was decided to wind up the 
mixed companies. However, while Mao was putting the Soviet nose out of 
joint about mixed companies in China, mixed companies in the European People's 
Democracies continued to be a symbol of Soviet brotherly aid. In December 
1954 I was in Moscow and heard a certain Meinshikov read his paper on Mixed 
Companies, Symbol of Soviet Brotherly Aid Offered to the People's Democracies, 
to a Conference of Social Sciences at the Soviet Central Party Committee. As 
we know, most of the mixed companies have been dissolved, but some of them 
still exist. Secondly, what struck me particularly when I read the minutes of 
the secret session was that the dissolution of the companies was not in the least 
explained by the arguments given by Mikoyan to the secret session of the July 
Plenum. 
On the contrary, in the communique announcing their dissolution, I read that 
they had played a very important role in the development of the People's Democ-
racies, that they had been a symbol of the brotherly Soviet aid offered to these 
countries, that they had been dissolved merely because their task had been 
completed. The Soviet dictators of the mixed companies received the highest 
decorations from the countries la which they had operated. That is why I was

1566 SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES 
amazed at the fantastic hypocrisy of the Soviet Party leaders, and their unwill-
ingness to tell the truth, when I saw the minutes of Mikoyan's speech. In prac-
tice, I saw one of the aspects of the alleged open sincerity of the political life 
in the new post-Stalin era. 
Soviet Experts Are Arrogant and Overpaid 
In another passage of the record of the secret session, Mikoyan also gave a 
fair assessment of the behavior of the Soviet experts and delegates in the People's 
Democracies. The work of our experts abroad, Mikoyan said, necessitates a 
good deal of tact and modesty. In no case can we hurt the feelings of the local 
population. But in practice, Mikoyan said, our experts have constantly violated 
this rule. They have been patronizing and arrogE nt. They thought that every-
body could learn from them, and that they had nothing to learn. In this way 
they often did a disservice to the cause of friendship between the Soviet Union 
and the People's Democracies. Mikoyan also admitted that the excessively 
high salaries of Soviet specialists were a source of discontent among local workers 
and employees. 
Mikoyan devoted a great deal of space to Soviet-Yugoslav economic relations. 
He admitted that the breaking of the trade agreement with Yugoslavia in 1949 
was a violation of international law, and there were many other instances, on a 
larger and smaller scale, of breaking trade agreements. Indeed, they were 
imperialistic moves, Mikoyan said. 
Principles Are Principles: But Business Is Business 
When I read this exceptionally frank statement of Mikoyan's I remembered 
several cases of unilateral breaking of trade agreements with Poland by the 
Soviet Union. I know, for example, that in the past few years, the Soviets broke 
the agreement on supplying wheat and cotton for Poland, and besides, the Soviet 
Union never paid any indemnity. Poland, on the other hand, was forced hastily 
to look for new sources of grain and cotton suppl-es on the Western markets. 
From the minutes of the secret session, it emerged clearly that Mikoyan had 
violently condemned all discriminatory practices :9ncerning the People's Democ-
racies. Last January I could ascertain how sincere this condemnation of past 
mistakes was. I was told that Mikoyan had delivered an address at the Con-
ference of Mutual Economic Aid which had been Yield last December in Budapest. 
There, the Polish delegation proposed, quite Justifiably after all, that the export 
of Polish coal and farm products to the Soviet Union and the other People's 
Democracies, should be decreased. The Polish delegation also called attention 
to the necessity of increasing exports of machines because this was the only way 
to improve Poland's difficult economic situation. 
In a long speech, Mikoyan said, among other things, that Poland's traditional 
exports were coal and farm produce and that she should continue to export them. 
I wonder how Mikoyan would have described this sort of economic aid last July? 
WHAT Is POLAND TO THE SOVIET POLITBURO? 
As I have mentioned several times, the secret session of the July Plenum was 
primarily a scene for the battle between Molotov and the rest of the Politburo. 
As usual in such battles, there was plenty of violent discussion and mutual 
recrimination, and we know that in the heat of argument, matters about which 
one normally remains silent reveal themselves That is precisely what hap-
pened in the course of those discussions. 
It began with Khrushchev attacking Molotov because the latter did not fully 
appreciate the damages that had arisen from the break with Marshal Tito and 
from the subsequent history of Soviet-Yugoslav relations. This accusation 
seemed to have hurt Molotov a great deal. He violently defended his policies 
and in his reply to Khrushchev's attacks, Polish affairs were brought suddenly 
to the surface. In his comments on Poland, Molotov revealed the truth about 
Soviet leaders' attitudes toward the People's Democracies. 
I quote here briefly some of the arguments Molotov used as I remember them 
from reading the stenographic report of that sec ret session. 
Molotov began with an appraisal of the situation which preceded the break 
with Yugoslavia. Indeed, he said, we made a grave error here. Why? Be-
cause without having exhausted all the possibilities for conciliation, we brought 
about a break with Yugoslavia so sharply. I admit, he went on, that this error 
in our policy caused many disadvantageous complications. Can the blame for 
this, however, be put on Beria and Beriaism?

SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES 1567 
I must admit that I read this last sentence with great emotion. Was it Molo-
tov's intention, I thought, to blame the break with Tito on Berta, and also on 
Stalin and his other collaborators? But Molotov had something quite different 
in mind. No, he said, to blame Berle and only Beria for breaking with Yugo-
slavia would have been a great error and untrue for an equal share of guilt 
belongs to Yugoslavia and Marshal Tito. At that time, Tito's behavior was 
provocative and anti-Soviet. If we had not then adopted the strong and definite 
stand we took, he continued, we would have been confronted with grave compli-
cations in the other People's Democracies. 
And that is how Polish affairs came to the surface. I read and did not believe 
my own eyes. 
Poland is So Many and So Many Divisions . . . 
Let us take Poland as an example, Molotov continued. Which is more impor-
tant to use, Poland or Yugoslavia? Poland has 10 million people more than 
Yugoslavia and Poland can mobilize 10 divisions more than Yugoslavia. And 
we know only too well that not everything was right with the Polish Army at 
the time of our conflict with Tito. There was, as we remember, Gomulka, in 
Poland. If we had not taken a strong stand in Yugoslavia's case, Molotov 
explained, who knows what would have happened in Poland? Poland would 
have wavered and gone Yugoslavia's way. That is why, Molotov stated, our 
sharp and definite reaction in the Yugoslav affair was perfectly justified, for 
it prevented a still greater disaster. 
However, we must admit, Molotov said, that our tactics were not always 
proper. The best proof of that is the fact that we failed to repair our position 
in Yugoslavia; hence, the conclusion that the policy we followed was false. 
I must say that I read this part of Molotov's speech with great irritation. 
Molotov was altogether cynical. Is that, I thought, the way a Soviet Foreign 
Minister and Moscow Politburo member treats the friendly People's Democracies? 
Is Poland for him merely the equivalent of so many people and so much cannon 
fodder? For only in this sense was Poland more valuable to him than Yugo-
slavia. What should we think of our own Party line with respect to Soviet 
policy, I thought, a policy which allegedly treats large and small nations 
equally? Wasn't this cynical statement of Molotov's, the acting chief of Soviet 
foreign policy, a proof that the Soviet Union was quite ready to sell out a smaller 
ally for the price of gaining a stronger one, one who has at its disposal a larger 
number of divisions? 
While reading Molotov's statement I was further struck by the fact thet?
as he put it?Soviet policy with respect to Yugoslavia was wrong because it 
failed to bring the anticipated results. Is it true, I thought, that even in deal-
ings with the People's Democracies, Molotov considers all methods, including 
provocations, permissible provided they bring the expected results? 
All Wolves Howl the Same 
I was particularly indignant about the fact that Molotov was justifying this 
policy of threat and blackmail even after Stalin's death. Even in the post-
Stalinist period, Moscow's policy of table pounding with respect to Poland and 
the other People's Democracies was still justified. 
I have already written that Molotov's speech made me indignant. I had 
naively supposed that in the other Politburo members' speeches, particularly in 
that of First Party Secretary Khrushchev, I would find unequivocal condemna-
tion of Molotov's stand. When I finished the stenographic record, I saw that my 
Illusions were naive. 
Certainly Khrushchev and other Politburo members attacked Molotov sharply, 
but their views were merely the other side of the same coin. Their attitudes 
toward the People's Democracies were similar to Molotov's; they differed from 
him only in their estimate of the situation. As an example, let us take Khru-
shchev's final speech. He argued against Molotov's thesis that in the 
Yugoslav case the policy was basically justified even if errors in it had taken 
place, for it prevented Titoist outbreaks in the other People's Democracies. 
Thus, Khrushchev said exactly the same thing as Molotov, except perhaps that 
he saw a different danger in the Yugoslav example. 
What was the difference between them? Molotov saw the danger in the 
absence of harsh policies toward Tito: he maintained that without such policies, 
other countries would follow in Yugoslavia's footsteps. On the other hand, 
Khrushchev maintained that the danger lay in making policy too harsh and 
this would result in pushing other People's Democracies on the Yugoslav road,

1568 SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES 
and this might have happened particularly after Stalin's death. Not with so 
much as a single word did he object to Molotov's contemptuous treatment of the 
People's Democracies. 
I understood then that Molotov, Khrushchev, and Mikoyan were in perfect 
agreement as to the basic role of the People's Democracies. The difference lay 
only in the degree of advantage that a policy would bring to the Soviet Union. 
Was it to be a line of compromise and ignoring of ideological deviations, as 
Khrushchev and Mikoyan wanted, or was it to be the older policy advocated by 
Molotov? But all of them?Khrushchev, Mikoyan, and Molotov treated the 
People's Democracies with equal contempt. The only difference was that the 
estimate by the first two was more realistic. 
Mr. MORRIS. Now, Mr. Bialer, did you have a mission at any time 
to go to Moscow? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, Sir. 
In November and December, 1954, I was the Assistant Chief of the 
official delegation of the Central Committee of the Polish Communist 
Party to the party authorities in Moscow. 
Mr. MORRIS. Now, while you were in Moscow, were you able to meet 
any of the top leaders of the Soviet Union? 
The INTERPRETER. My most important task was rather to get in 
touch with the propaganda agencies in Moscow and Leningrad con-
nected with the Russian Communist Party. 
Naturally, in this capacity I met different, what you would call 
important people both in the Soviet Union as well as in Poland. 
But as far as le relations and the state of affairs in the Russian 
Communist Party are concerned, among the leadership of the Russian 
Communist Party, I know this from the official secret instructions 
which were sent from Moscow to Warsaw, and thus I got acquainted 
with most of them. 
Mr. MORRIS. Do you recall a visit that Mr. Khrushchev made to 
Warsaw in April of 1955? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, sir ? I recall this very well, indeed. 
Mr. Moms. Did Khrushchev address the Communist Party work-
ers in Warsaw in 1955? 
The INTERPRETER. Khrushchev, after his arrival in Poland, first 
had a meeting with a large body of the workers in Novahuta. His 
second meeting in Poland was in Warsaw with the Central Committee 
and the active of the Polish Communist Party in Warsaw. I was 
present at both meetings. 
Mr. Mcanus. Now, will you describe the makeup of the audience 
that attended this second meeting at which Khrushchev spoke? 
The INTERPRETER. We called it the active of the Central Committee 
of the Communist Party in Poland. This means the most active, im-
portant members of the Communist Party. 
Mr. MORRIS. What was the number? 
The INTERPRETER. No more than 200 people, rather much less. 
Mr. MORRIS. Much less than 200 people. 
Now, will you tell us what Khrushchev said to that particular group 
of Polish Communists? 
This is now April 1955, is it not? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, sir. 
First, both of his speeches were very aggressive. 
I drew a conclusion that the aim of his speech was to maintain an 
offensive spirit among the party workers.

SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES 1569 
First, he started his speech by saying that the heavy industry and 
the armaments must be maintained at all cost. 
Mr. MORRIS. Heavy industry and armaments must be maintained 
at all cost? 
The INTERPRETER. At all cost. 
For instance, I remember such a detail. He said: 
It is true that you do not have good ladies' hats. It is true that there is 
probably not enough food in Poland. But you must remember, we must have, 
first of all, heavy industry. The more steel we produce for the Soviet bloc, the 
more sleepless nights Mr. Dulles will have in Washington. 
Mr. MORRIS. "Mr. Dulles will have in Washington"? 
The INTERPRETER. In Washington. Literally, he said, "He turns in 
his bed when he learns about it." 
Again, the most provocative incident in his speech against the 
Western World was the following, and again I quote almost his words 
since I remember them so well: 
"We are discussing coexistence, but, of course, we must realize that 
we cannot coexist eternally, for a long time. One of us must go to 
his grave." 
Mr. MORRIS. Meaning the free world and the United States on the 
one hand, and the Polish nation on the other? 
The INTERPRETER. On the one hand the United States, the Western 
World; on the other hand, the Soviet bloc. One of us must go one 
day to his grave. 
[Continuing:] "We do not want to go to the grave. 
"They," meaning Americans and the westerners, "they do not want 
to go to their grave, either. 
"So what can be done? 
"We must push them to their grave." 
This was the general tone of his speech. 
Certainly we could recognize immediately the difference between 
his tone when he was speaking for the newspapers or conferences 
and when he was speaking to us at that meeting. 
Mr. MORRIS. There was a difference in his tone? 
The INTERPRETER. There was a difference, a basic difference, in his 
tone. And, of course, the text, too. 
Mr. MORRIS. Now, when you described that conversation to us, 
did Khrushchev use precisely the same emphasis that you have given 
us, or is that your estimate of Khrushchev's speech? 
The INTERPRETER. Of course, there is a possibility that I misquoted 
1 or 2 words. Basically I quoted him, since they were so important and 
I remembered them, and they were fixed in my memory. 
In addition, of course, his speech was put on a tape and then I had 
the opportunity to listen to the tape again; so I remember this very 
well. 
I heard it after the Geneva Conference. 
Mr. Moms. Now, as an active propagandist, did you deal with the 
concept of coexistence? 
The INTERPRETER. This was one of the most important matters to 
which I attended. 
For instance, after the first Geneva Conference, I was sent to many 
provincial towns where I met the active of the local Communist 
Party, discussing the situation.

1570 SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES 
I authored several instructions, several papers, for the party workers 
in this matter. 
And, of course, there were organized for me several discussions in 
which I would pass, orally, my advices and instructions. 
Mr. MORRIS. What is the concept of coexistence? Is it used as a 
weapon in Communist warfare? 
The INTERPRETER. I would summarize this in such a way: Our most 
important task with regard to the coexistence business was to con-
vince and to show to the people that the concept of coexistence is not a 
withdrawal on the part of the Soviet bloc, but an offensive. 
Mr. MORRIS. You say it is not a withdrawal? 
The INTERPRETER. Withdrawal?
Mr. MORRIS. But an offensive? 
The INTERPRETER. But an offensive of the Soviet bloc. 
This was necessary, because in the first period of the so-called 
coexistence, even the high membership of the Communist Party some-
times misunderstood the meaning of the Soviet policy. 
This is why we were forced to organize a very large campaign all 
over Poland in order to straighten them out and to explain to them the 
real meaning of the coexistence campaign. 
Senator BUTLER. In other words, this is just another twist in the 
devious road of the Communist Party to world domination? 
The INTERPRETER. Basically, yes, sir, with this difference, that this 
is so important in the Communist strategy that I would call it, rather, 
basic strategy. 
I would place it in a category of basic strategy, since one of the main 
purposes is to isolate the United States from the political, economic, 
and ideological point of view, in the world, and this, of course, is very 
important. 
Senator BUTLER. In your opinion, is it equally important as the dis-
solution of the Comintern? 
The INTERPRETER. I would say that the dissolution of the COM-
intern?
Mr. BIALER. Cominform. 
The INTERPRETER. Cominform?is one of the expressions of this iso-
lation campaign against the United States. 
Senator BUTLER. In other words, it is part of the general policy? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, sir; part of a very large political program. 
Mr. MORRIS. And would you say, Mr. Bialer, it was your purpose 
as an active propagandist to instruct the workers as to the meaning of 
this new strategy, particularly with respect to that aspect of it which 
indicated that it was not a withdrawal, but rather an offensive measure? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes. This was one of my most important tasks. 
We considered it as the most important job at that time. There was, 
for instance, a saying, a joke, circulated among the party members: 
"It is true that we do not want any more revolution because the West-
erners will settle it themselves." 
Mr. MORRIS. Now, how did the Geneva Conference of 1955 fit into 
this framework? 
The INTERPRETER. As far 118 I conceived, on the basis of my observa-
tions as a propagandist in Poland, that Conference indeed was a point 
of issue for our propaganda, for all this coexistence campaign which 
I described for.

SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES 1571 
Not only in Poland, but also in the Russian Communist Party, in 
the Soviet Union, everywhere, this Conference was presented as a 
great Soviet victory. And may I tell you that my conviction is that 
the masses believed it. 
Mr. MORRIS. The Polish masses and the people in the Communist 
countries believed it? 
The INTERPRETER. This is my opinion. 
Mr. MORRIS. Now, do you know anything about Khrushchev's ma-
nipulations of Beria, Malenkov, and Molotov? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes; I can speak about these matters on the basis 
of three secret documents which I knew and which deal with this 
matter. 
The first document was a letter, a secret letter of the Central Com-
mittee of the Russian Communist Party, dealing with the matter of 
the Beria incident. 
The second document was a letter of the leadership of the Russian 
Communist Party dealing with the dismissal of Malenkov. 
And the third document is a secret official stenogram, minutes, of 
the plenum of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party, 
which took place in July 1955. 
Mr. Mouins. Now, you went into these three episodes in this declara-
tion that you prepared, did you not? 
The INTERPRETER. Partly. 
Mr. Mona's. Now, will you succinctly, as briefly as possible, tell us 
about those three documents with respect to the question? 
The INTERPRETER. First, these 3 documents describe the 3 basic stages 
in the personnel changes in the Soviet leadership. 
The first will be liquidation of Beria, the second, dismissal of Malen-
kov, and the third, the alienation from the leadership of Molotov. 
In the first letter, the reasons for the liquidation of Beria were given. 
In addition to those accusations which were made public in the press, 
there were also other accusations unknown to the party. 
For instance?and this comes to my mind in view of the present 
visit of Marshal Tito in Moscow?one of the important accusations 
against Beria, secret accusations, was the following: 
The accusation was such: The best proof that Beria was engaged 
in espionage activities directed against the Soviet Union was his 
suggestion, after the death of Stalin, to reestablish relations with 
Tito. 
Mr. Momas. You mean that accusations were made against Beria 
because he sought to reestablish contact with Tito? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, sir. 
For instance, I remember there was a very particular accusation 
that Beria wanted to establish a special telephone line between Moscow 
and Belgrade in order to be in touch with Tito. 
In addition to those accusations which I enumerated in the docu-
ment you mentioned, there was given also the method by which Beria 
was liquidated. 
For instance, there was a paragraph I remember that a political 
bureau of the party could not reveal for some time its suspicions con-
cerning Beria. So they had to approve even erroneous decisions of 
Beria for a certain period of time. 
And one of the examples was the German affair.

1572 SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES 
For instance, the Soviet policy toward Eastern Germany in 1953 
which resulted in the Berlin revolt of June 1953, was initiated by 
Beria. The political bureau of the Russian Communist Party real-
ized it. They didn't want to stop Beria's policy, so that he would 
not realize that they suspected him. 
There is also, I remember now, another paragraph in that document 
which will probably interest you in view of the present de-Staliniza-
tion campaign. 
And this paragraph consisted: There was a question: 
How was it possible that we, the leadership of the Russian Communist Party, 
were able to liquidate Beria in such a short time after Stalin died, in only 
3 months? 
The whole idea of this argument was to prove that as long as Stalin 
lived, the leadership of the party did not know the true activities of 
Beria. 
The final phase of this argument was that Beria became careless, 
and because he became so careless and also impudent, convinced of 
his power, we could discover his activities against the people. 
I want to remind you that at that time Beria was liquidated with 
the help of Malenkov, who was against him. 
In February 1955, kalenkov's turn came. 
The most characteristic aspect of the second document dealing with 
Malenkov's affair is that very many accusations directed against Beria 
had been repeated now with regard to Malenkov. 
Of course, this is one of the aspects of the Soviet tactics. Those 
accusations were not revealed at the time of the liquidation of Beria, 
but the leadership waited for Malenkov's help to liquiate Beria, and 
then they liquidated Malenkov with the same accusations. 
For instance, an accusation concerning the agricultural crises was 
repeated with regard to Beria and then also with regard to Malenkov. 
The main accusation against Malenkov was that he underestimated
the importance of building the heavy industry. 
It was maintained that such a policy of underestimating heavy in-
dustry was to become dangerous for the people's democracies. 
This was in connection with Imre Nagy, the Prime Minister of 
Hungary, who was following the same Malenkov line in Hungary. 
Malenkov was also indicted for coresponsibility in the Leningrad 
trials. 
The Leningrad trials lasted several years, and in those trials several 
thousands of very active Communists were liquidated. 
It was on that occasion of the dismissal of Malenkov that Shepilov, 
the present Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union? appeared. 
At that time, it was Shepilov who was directing the whole anti-
Malenkov campaign. 
I think that one could say that probably the present appointment 
of Shepilov is a kind of reward for his services in the dismissal of 
Malenkov. 
During the same session which decided the dismissal of Malenkov, 
the Molotov affair started. 
Again, the same method was applied as with regard to Malenkov. 
Molotov was accused of a nonconformist speech which he delivered 
at the time of Malenkov's dismissal. He was not accussed at the time 
of the Malenkov dismissal because he was helpful at the time. He was 
accused of this several months later.

SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES 1573 
Around 6 weeks after the dismissal of Malenkov, Molotov's incident 
took place. 
At that time, the secret meeting of the Presidium of the Russian 
Communist Party took place, and the discussion concerned the rela-
tions with Yugoslavia. 
At that meeting Molotov announced himself against the reestablish-
ment of relations with Yugoslavia, relations government-to-govern-
ment. 
He was criticized at that meeting and then at the time when Khrush-
chey and Bulganin left for Belgrade to visit Tito, he agreed, of course, 
with their policy, meaning to reestablish the official relations between 
the two governments. 
However, although Molotov agreed to a reestablishment of the offi-
cial international relations between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, 
he did not approve of Khrushchev's and Bulganin's visit, and he did 
not approve of a reestablishment of party relationship between the 
Russian Communist Party and Tito's Communist Party. 
However, he was outvoted. The decision was taken that Khru-
shchev and Bulganin should go to Yugoslavia, and the decision was 
taken that Molotov's disapproval should be discussed in July of the 
same year at the next meeting of the Presidium of the Communist 
Party. 
And indeed, in July 1955, the meeting took place and the central 
committee of the Communist Party officially condemned Molotov's 
position. 
In addition to this matter, several other important matters were 
discussed at that meeting. 
Mr. MORRIS. Now, do you cover those in this declaration? 
The INTERPRETER. The minutes of the July meeting of the central 
committee took more than 100 pages, and, of course, I couldn't cover 
them in this document. 
Mr. MoRais. Does it cover the general area? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes. 
Mr. MORRIS. Now, are there any more points that you want to make 
with respect to my general question at this time? 
Mr. Bialer, I realize it is a vast subject. There are some aspects of 
intelligence Which directly relate to the work of the Internal Security 
Subcommittee. If you think that you have made a fairly represent-
ative statement in response to the question, we might go to these other 
subjects. 
The INTERPRETER. I hope that perhaps at another occasion I will 
have an opportunity to speak about this document, which is very in-
teresting. So probably at the present moment I shall not continue. 
Mr. MORRIS. Do you want to make some statements about it now, by 
way of concluding that last aspect of your testimony? 
The INTERPRETER. I would like to add that there was also a very long 
and important discussion concerning Austria at that meeting. 
Molotov proposed the Soviet withdrawal from Austria. 
Now, the argument against his position, the argument taken by 
IChruslichev,. was that the Soviet withdrawal from Austria will not 
cost the Soviet Union anything; it will be without any importance, 
anyway. 
This kind of withdrawal would not weaken the Soviet Union from 
any point of view, from any practical point of view.

1574 SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES 
It would not weaken the Soviet Union. 
That is all for the moment as far as this matter is concerned. 
Mr. MORRIS. Now, in your work in the Communist Party of Poland, 
did you come to know anything about espionage or military intelli-
gence that was carried out by the Polish Communist leaders? 
The INTERPRETER. You mean, against the United States? 
Mr. MORRIS. Against the United States. 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, I know certain facts. Are you interested? 
Mr. MORRIS. Do you know any Polish military intelligence agents 
who came to the United States? 
The INTERPRETER. I know two such cases. 
The first case concerned Colonel Melchior. 
Mr. MORRIS. Who was Colonel Melchior? 
The INTERPRETER. He is one of the most outstanding and respected 
employees of the Polish military intelligence. 
I have known him personally for the fast 10 years. 
In 1949, we were working together and then at that time in 1949 he 
passed to the strictly military intelligence activities. 
He was appointed as the Polish vice consul in New York City. 
Mr. Moms. Now, was that a cover for his activities, or was that his 
real role? 
The INTERPRETER. Well, sir, I will answer this way: Colonel Mel-
chior is on such a level and he is considered as such an outstanding 
member of the military intelligence in Poland, and so well known in 
Poland, that if lie were appointed as the Ambassador to the United 
States, it would not be too much of a distinction. 
So since he was only vice consul, which is not such a high position, 
it was evident that this was only a cover for his other activities. 
Senator BUTLER. That was not the question. The question was 
whether he was using his position as a cover for his real activities. 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, I am sure of it, that this was only a cover 
for his activities concerning military intelligence. 
Senator BUTLER. And espionage? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, sir. 
I see as, for instance, one of the indications, that after his return to 
Poland, he went directly to military intelligence and is working in 
the same department he was workingin at the moment he left Poland. 
I saw him in December 1955, exactly in that capacity. 
Mr. MORRIS. Now, did he use the name of Melchior, or did he go 
by any other name? 
The INTERPRETER. No, sir. His true name was Melon, but the name 
which he is using for years is Melchior, the first one. 
Mr. MORRIS. Row, what was the other example of espionage in the 
United States? 
The INTERPRETER. The second case, well known to me, was sending 
to the United States an officer of the Polish military intelligence, 
Samuel Ehrlich. 
I have known him also for very many years. 
In 1950-51, there were rumors spread on purpose that he was leav-
ing for Moscow for a special school in the field of intelligence. 
So he disappeared from Poland. 
In reality, as I learned later, he did not go to Moscow at that time. 
He was sent to the United States and he was assigned to look for a job, 
and he received a position at one of the American universities.

SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES 1575 
He went to one of the American universities. 
Mr. Mourns. And do you know that he had an espionage assignment 
at the time? 
The INTERPRETER. I am certain of it. He was and he is presently 
a captain in the Polish military intelligence. I saw him before I left 
Poland, in Poland. 
Mr. MORRIS. Now, you do know what that man looks like; do you 
not? 
The INTERPRETER. Very, very exactly, I know. 
Mr. MORRIS. And if we show you some pictures, you might be able 
to tell us who he is? 
The INTERPRETER. Surely. 
Mr. MORRIS. You do not know whether he used the name of Samuel 
Ehrlich when he was teaching at one of the American universities. 
The INTERPRETER. He was not a professor at that university. He 
was at the university, and, of course, I would recognize him. 
When I said that he was at the university, I did not mean that he 
was a professor. He was a student at the university, in order to have 
an official coverage for his activities in this country. He is not an old 
man. 
Mr. MORRIS. Now, how is the Polish intelligence organized? 
The INTERPRETER. I couldn't give you exact information on this 
subject. This is a very specialized subject. 
Mr. MORRIS. And your field is propaganda and not intelligence? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, sir;  mostly political propaganda. 
Mr. MORRIS. Now, did you know any of the American Communists 
who left the United States and returned to Poland, their native 
Poland? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes; several cases. 
Mr. MORRIS. Did you know a man named Arski? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, sir; I know him. 
Mr. MORRIS. Is that Stefan Arski? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, sir. 
Mr. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, Stefan Arski used to be one of the 
people on the Polish desk of the Office of War Information in the 
United States. 
What was Stefan Arski doing? 
The INTERPRETER. Mr. Stefan Arski is presently in Poland. He 
is a journalist, and one of the most violently antiwestern and anti-
American journalists. He specializes in American affairs, and he 
contributes mostly to the People's Tribune, an official organ of the 
Communist Party in Poland. 
He wrote several books which we used as a kind of basis for our 
anti-American propaganda. 
Mr. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Mandel here has the testimony 
before the Kersten Committee, the House committee that investigated 
the Katyn Forest massacre, and Mr. Arski of the Office of War Infor-
mation figured in that inquiry. 
I wonder if we might put that testimony before that committee 
about Mr. Arski into the record. 
Senator BUTLER. It will be so ordered.

Mr. MAcHnowicz. For your information, he was also employed by the Office of

of the Communist paper Robotnik, which means the Worker, the most outspoken 
anti-American organ in Warsaw. He at that time was also an employee of the 
Office of War Information. You have no recollection of him? 
Mr. DAVIS. No. 
Mr. MACHROWITZ. You have no recollection of either Ambassador Ciechanowski 
or Congressman Lesinski warning you about the fact that these three persons 
were known Communists, and were in the employ of the Office of War Informa-

Mr. DAVIS. I don't remember that Mr. Lesinski ever warned me about any-
thing. Mr. Ciechanowski, perhaps by his excessive number of warnings, made 
me forget which particular ones he especially spoke about.

told Ambassador Ciechanowski to keep away from that matter? 
Mr. Davis. I don't know, " * 
Mr. MORRIS. Now, did you know Irving; Potash? 
Mr. Chairman, Irving Potash was convicted under the Smith Act 
and ordered deported to Poland in 1955. 
What is Mr. Potash doing in Poland? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, I know him. I spent with Irving Potash, 
formerly a member of the political bureau of the Polish Communist 
Party, of the American Communist Party?I spent with him 2 weeks 
at the International Communist House, Holiday House, in Zakopane, 
in Poland. This was March 1955. 
Mr. MORRIS. Now, what is Potash's job in Poland? 
The INTERPRETER. The most characteristic factor concerning this 
man is that he was not used in Poland for the propaganda work, and 
he disappeared in Poland altogether. 
He disappeared. He is no more. 
I remember those 2 weeks I spent with him. At that time he was 
very m,uch emotionally broken, affected. He suffered very much 
seeing the reality in Poland. 
He had no idea before how bad things are in Poland. 
Particularly he was impressed by the unfriendly attitude of the 
Polish people, the Polish masses, toward the Polish Communist Party. 
In any case, the fact that a man of this caliber was not used in 
Poland in a propaganda way, this is a very exceptional case, and rather 
indicates that unpleasant things happened to him. 
Mr. MORRIS. Do you know Henrik Podolski ? 
Mr. Chairman, Henrik Podolski was the former editor-in-chief of 
Glos Ludowy, a Polish Communist paper in Detroit.

Henrik Podolski has two main assignments presently in Poland. 
The first one is to work in the campaign of repatriation of the Polish 
emigres, postwar emigres in the West, and the second, to instruct the 
American paper, People's Voice, in Detroit. 
Mr. MORRIS. You mean, he is still running the Detroit newspaper? 
The INTERPRETER. This paper receives strict instructions from 
Poland, and he is the man who is sending them. 
I met him several times in connection with his work in the propa-
ganda division and foreign affairs division of the central committee 
of the Polish Communist Party. 
Mr. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, I have many other such instances, at 
least some other instances such as that, together with a great deal of 
other material, and if you say, Senator, we do have to stop now, I 
think we will have to resume again on Monday. 
Senator BUTLER. Yes. We will adjourn now and recess until 
Monday. 
I would like to say this for the record, that the testimony of Mr. 
Bialer this morning, with its importance to the work of the Internal 
Security Subcommittee and the understanding of recent world events, 
indicates the great usefulness of defectors. This testimony shows very 
convincingly that there are important people behind the Iron Curtain 
who want to join the free world. When these people come over to us, 
they bring important intelligence information. 
In this way, we can learn the real meaning of the Communist 
strategy of world conquest. 
But more important, their defection impresses on the world the 
great vulnerability of the Communist world?the fact that these people 
are kept in bondage. All our agencies as well as the Congress should 
do everything possible to encourage more defections. 
I want to thank you, Mr. Bialer, for coming here. We will stand 
in recess until Monday morning. 
Mr. MORRIS. Senator, the Judiciary Committee meets Monday 
morning. Suppose we make it 2 o'clock in the afternoon on Monday? 
Senator BUTLER. We will stand in recess until 2 o'clock Monday 
afternoon, at which time we will ask you to return, Mr. Bialer.

TESTIMONY OF SEWERYN DIALER, AS INTERPRETED BY 
JAN KARSKI?Resumed 
Mr. MORRIS. Senator, in connection with the aspects of the testimony 
of Mr. Bialer on internal security, we had at the last session men-
tioned the case of Samuel Ehrlich, who was an important intelli-
dense espionage personality in Poland, who was sent to the United 
tates with the knowledge of the witness. He came here under the 
rover of a student at an American university. 
We also had the case of Colonel Melchior, who was the Polish vice 
consul in New York, and Mr. Bialer has testified that, even though 
he was appearing as a vice consul in New York, he was actually one of 
the top military espionage people in Poland. 
We had discussed the case of Irving Potash, who is now in Poland. 
We had the case of Stefan Arski, who was one of the officials of our 
own Office of War Information, who is one of the people in Poland 
directing anti-American propaganda against the United States. 
We had the case of Mr. Podolski who is now, according to the tes-
timony of Mr. Bialer, directing a Detroit newspaper from 'Warsaw.

to go into those at the beginning of this hearing.

1580 SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY EV THE UNITED STATES 
Mr. MORRIS. Michael Kalescki. What is Michael Kalescki doing 
flow? 
The INTERPRETER. He arrived in Poland in the summer of 1955. 
Mr. MORRIS. From the United States? 
The INTERPRETER. From the United States. Yes. He was working 
in the United States, in the United Nations Organization, and he 
arrived in Poland in the summer of 1955. 
Presently he occupies a position of personal economic ambassador to 
the virtual economic dictator of Poland, Mine. 
Mr. MoRms. What is he doing? You say he is an economic adviser ? 
The INTERPRETER. A personal economic adviser. 
Mr. MORRIS. To the?
The INTERPRETER. To the virtual economic dictator in Poland, 
named Mine. In addition, he is also charged with studies concerning 
the economic situation in the United States and in other parts of the 
world. 
Mr. MORRIS. Now, what is George Siskind doing? 
George Siskind, Senator, was an American Communist who was 
prosecuted under the Smith Act and has been deported to Poland. 
The INTERPRETER. Presently, he is working in the Institute of Inter-
national Affairs, which is attached to the Polish Foreign Ministry. 
And again in this institute, he is charged with American affairs. 
I would like to stress here that Siskind is particularly active pres-
ently in Poland in the field of anti-American propaganda. 
The second question which I would like to stress here is this: As you 
know, recently there were discussions in Poland concerning relaxation 
of the propaganda and also a tendency to disclose more truth about 
the Western World to the Polish people. Siskind was one of those 
men who did not want it. 
Recently, for instance, he published an article in this year, the cur-
rent year, an article in a Communist paper, New Roads, in which he 
attacked America with fantastic lies. 
Mr. MORRIS. Mr. Mandel, do we have anything in the record to show 
what position Mr. George Siskind had with the American Commu-
nrst Party? 
Mr. MANDEL. He was a member of the Central Committee of the 
Communist Party and a teacher at its national training school. 
Mr. MORRIS. In the United States? 
Mr. MANDEL. In the United States. 
Mr. MORRIS. Now, did you know Mr. Katz-Suchy ? 
The INTERPRETER. I have known him very well indeed. I worked 
with him for a while. 
Mr. Monms. And you say you have known him very well? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, SIT. 
Mr. MORRIS. Will you tell us what he has been doing in Poland? 
The INTERPRETER. First, he is director of that Institute of Interna-
tional Affairs which I mentioned before, where Siskind is working; 
and, as you know, he is also a Polish delegate to the United Nations, to 
different conferences of the United Nations. 
At the return of Katz-Suchy to Poland from the United States, 
where he was a guest of the United States, it was exploited by him 
and by the party for violent anti-American propaganda. 
I must say that he was doing it in a very primitive, obvious way.

SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES 1581 
I would like to add here, lately I could observe some changes in him. 
For instance, in December 1955 I took part in a certain discussion in 
the party where Katz-Suchy was also present. 
The discussion concerned peaceful coexistence, and there Katz-
Suchy made an observation that he doubted personally if the United 
States really wanted a, war. 
For this he was criticized very much by other participants in the 
discussion. 
Mr. MORRIS. What was that last answer? I am sorry, sir. 
The INTERPRETER. For this he was criticized by other participants 
in the discussion. 
Mr. MORRIS. I see. 
Is there anything more he wants to say about Mr. Katz-Suchy ? 
The INTERPRETER. At the present, I would prefer not to say more. 
Mr. MORRIS. Do you know anything about the Soviet truce team 
in Korea, the Polish truce team making up the neutral commission 
in Korea? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes; I have certain information from the high-
est sources. 
The first one, for instance: The Chairman of the Polish Truce 
Commission in Korea, General Morsky, was my subordinate in the 
party before he left for Korea. 
For instance, the Polish commissions for Korea and for Vietnam 
received a special fund in order to get collaborators from other nations, 
for instance, Swiss people, or Canadians, or others. 
In this respect, 1 would like to say, for instance, how well it was 
organized. In the summer of 1955, a special officer of the Polish 
military intelligence, Major Chylinski, left for Vietnam in order to 
check, or supervise, this kind of activity. 
He left in order to check how the work of getting agents from 
among the Swiss, Canadian or French commissions was going on. 
Mr. MORRIS. Let me see if I understand that, now. You say that 
Mr. Bialer says that special funds were allocated by the Polish Com-
munist Government so that these funds could be used to recruit and 
to get agents in other delegations who would help the Polish team? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes. 
Chairman EASTLAND. Now, wait a minute. He said he had that 
information from the highest sources. Who are those sources? 
The INTERPRETER. As I told you, Senator, the first source of infor-
mation was General Morsky, the chairman of the Polish team in 
Korea, who was my subordinate in the party. The second source of ' 
information was General Krzenien, his predecessor in Korea. The 
third source of information was General Grosz, the chairman of 
the Polish team in the neutral commission in Cambodia. 
But the most reliable information certainly was that from Major 
Chylinski, who was sent to Vietnam to supervise this action of recruit-
ing agents. 
I had also other sources of information which I would prefer to 
give you at some other occasion. 
Mr. MORRIS. Now, was this an intelligence  
The INTERPRETER. I have in mind closed-door. 
Mr. MORRIS. I see. Was this an intelligence operation? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, sir. 
Mr. MORRIS. Have you other--

1582 SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES 
The INTERPRETER. He was formerly adjutant of the chief of the 
Polish military intelligence, General Komar. 
Mr. MORRIS. Now, I wonder if you would give us same more ex-
amples as to how this operation was conducted. 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, sir. 
There was one other means. There is a special instruction and 
funds for the Polish member of the Polish team to give loans, even to 
impose financial loans to the members of other commissions to have 
them in hand. 
Mr. MORRIS. Let me see if I understand that. You mean there was a 
money grant made so that people on the Polish team could make money 
loans to people on the other neutral teams? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, Sir. And one other instance: Usually Polish 
members have vodka, a certain amount of vodka which they distribute 
in order to get social relations with them and to have occasion to speak 
to them and to get them as agents, to have social relations as often as 
possible with them. 
What is probably more important is this: Any derogatory informa-
tion about anyone from any other commission is very meticulously col-
lected and immediately sent to Warsaw and eventually used in the 
future. 
Another factor, for instance: The Polish teams in South as well as 
North Korea are in closest touch with the central committee of the 
Communist Party in North Korea. 
In this respect, numerous meetings of the central committee of the 
North Korean Communist Party were held. Members of the Polish 
teams would be there, and they would receive advice from the central 
committee of the North Korean Communist Party. 
Mr. MORRIS. You mean the North Korean Communists would be ad-
vising the members of the so-called Polish neutral team? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, sir. 
Mr. MORRIS. Are there any other such instances, Mr. Bialer ? Do 
you know of any other such instances? 
Tho INTERPRETER. I know this problem well. So I think probably it 
would be better, sir, if you would ask me specific questions. I don't 
know what you have in mind. 
Mr. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, a news dispatch in today's Washington 
Daily News, for instance, says that: 
Allied forces in South Korea are gradually being disarmed by the creeping obso-
lescence of their weapons compared with the illegally modernized Communist 
forces in North Korea, high American officials charged today. 
If the United States, the Republic of Korea, and other allies continue to abide 
by the 1953 truce restrictions much longer, their forces in Korea will be com-
pletely outdone by the Communists, these sources warn. 
Now, do you know that the Communists in North Korea are building 
up their forces against the American forces and the U. N. forces in 
South Korea? 
The INTERPRETER. Of course' I couldn't tell you to what degree the 
armaments in North Korea could be dangerous to South Korea or our 
allies. But I can only say that there is a strict collaboration between 
the Polish teams in the truce commission and the North Korean Com-
munist Party.

And these armaments are taking place and the Polish teams are 
doing everything in their power to cover those armaments before 
the world public opinion. 
Mr. MORRIS. Now, do you know what currency makes up these 
special funds? Is it American currency or what currency? 
The INTERPRETER. Not in Polish currency, but in different western 
currencies. 
Mr. MORRIS. Mr. Bialer, do you know what Oscar Lange is doing 
now? 
Oscar Lange, Mr. Chairman, was formerly an American citizen, 
who sometime late in the war and shortly after the war went over 
to Soviet Poland. 
The INTERPRETER. I know him very well. Oscar Lange holds a very 
high position in the present Poland. 
Mr. MORRIS. Now, I believe he passes as a Socialist. Is he a 
Socialist? 
The INTERPRETER. He is a member of the central committee of the 
Polish Communist Party. 
He is a member of the state council in Poland and altogether he 
is a very high official in Poland. Presently he is out of Poland. 
Presently he is in India performing a task of an economic adviser 
to the Indian Government. He spent a certain time in India also last 
year, and there he was helping the Indian Government form their 
economic plan. 
Naturally, he represents the interests not only of the Polish Com-
munists but of all the Soviet bloc in India. 
Mr. MORRIS. Now, Mr. Bialer, we have been taking testimony in 
the Internal Security Subcommittee for the last 6 or 8 weeks on 
the repatriation campaign. 
Have you had any experience with the Polish repatriation 
campaign? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes; I have certain information in this repect. 
First, as far as the aim of repatriation is concerned, it is in the main 
an economic one. Repatriation has an aim, particularly political 
goals. They charge that repatriation is important from the internal 
and from the international point of view. 
The party in Poland wants first of all the repatriation of the Polish 
intellectuals. 
So far they consider in Warsaw that no great achievements took 
place as far as the return of intellectuals is concerned. 
They are interested particularly in repatriation of those who left 
Poland after the war and went to the West. They wanted them to 
come back. For instance, the Polish sailors. There were several 
Polish sailors on the ship Labor, and they asked for asylum in the 
T7nited States. 
Some of them returned to Poland and then they were used in Poland 
for a very serious propaganda campaign. 
Particularly I would like to stress that they want back those who 
left Poland after the war, in order to use them for propaganda. 
They do not care so much for the so-called old emigrees. 
As far as the methods are concerned, there is a special radio station 
called Kraj, The Country. There are also leaflets which are being 
sent out. This concerned the so-called old emigration, those people 
who left Poland before the Second World War.

1584 SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES 
This kind of propaganda from Kraj, from leaflets, from the old 
emigration, exaggerates so much that even they go further than the 
official Communist propaganda, because they believe that the old 
emigrees would believe it. 
As far as the new emigration is concerned, meaning the emigration 
of the Second World War and after the Second World War, there were 
mainly four methods used. 
Mr. MORRIS. These are the four steps in their repatriation campaign? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes; in working on them. 
First of all, as far as the new emigration is concerned, the personal 
contacts play a very important role. So first they received individual 
letters from their families. 
Mr. MoRilis. Now, did you personally engage in this repatriation 
campaign? 
The INTERPRETER. These activities were carried on by the foreign 
section of the Central Committee of the Polish Communist Party. I 
collaborated closely with that section. 
MT. MORRIS. I see. 
And you say the first means of getting people to repatriate is by 
personal contact, letters, and personal discussions? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes. Altogether, personal contacts, they stress 
them very much. 
So the first step, the first method, is those letters from their families. 
Here I want to say that those letters are genuine letters. They are 
really written by the families. Of course, they were enforced by the 
party. 
Mr. MORRIS. They were enforced? 
The INTERPRETER. They were enforced. 
Mr. MORRIS. In other words, the people had to write them? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes. They were not written of their own initia-
tive. They were ordered to write them. 
It was organized; the whole campaign. 
Mr. MORRIS. Now, what is the second point? 
The INTERPRETER. The second method is promises: 
If you return to Poland, you will have a better job and you will make more 
money and you will have more opportunities than you have in the country in 
which you are living presently. 
The third method is an appeal to ambition, to vanity, to a desire of 
a personal glory: 
If you return to Poland, you will be famous; you will have opportunities to 
speak to the people. 
The fourth method is simply blackmail, sheer blackmail. 
Mr. Momus. Will you explain that? 
The INTERPRETER. So here in this respect I would like to draw your 
attention to one thing. Before, the blackmail was a direct blackmail. 
A man would come to a prospective returnee and tell him, "If you do 
not return, we will say about you this and this." Now, this direct 
blackmail is not carried on anymore. More subtle methods are being 
used. 
So now they learned not to speak so directly. So a man from the 
Embassy, for instance, would approach such a Polish emigrant and 
he will tell him, "We advise you to come back, Comrade. Remember, 
you have a family over there. You want them to be happy." They

SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE "UNITED STATES 1585 
do not finish their threat; this in order that it cannot be proved that 
they blackmailed the man. 
Naturally, a man who is from Poland, even if the conversation is not 
finished, understands very well what the other man wants to tell him. 
But legally, naturally, he cannot prove that he was blackmailed. 
Mr. MORRIS. Were you in Poland when the Polish seamen returned 
last October? 
The INTERPRETER. Who? 
Mr. Monms. The Polish seamen who redefected, returned? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, sir. I was in Poland. 
Mr. Momus. Would you tell us something about that? 
The INTERPRETER. So far as those sailors, or seamen, were concerned, 
exactly these kinds of methods were used with regard to them. 
Mr. MORRIS. And was that much of a propaganda victory for the 
Communists in Warsaw? 
The INTERPRETER. I think that they are very successful in this kind 
of propaganda activities. 
Mr. MORRIS. Was that particular one a success? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes. It was a very great success and I doubt if 
all of you realize it in this country. 
Mr. MORRIS. Now, do you know, a few years ago two Russian flyers, 
a man named Barsov and a man named Pirogov, both defected. In 
the course of time one of them, Barsov, redefected. Now, we have 
heard from Mr. Petrov, in Australia, that Mr. Barsov was executed in 
the Soviet Union after he redefected. Do you know anything about 
that? 
The INTERPRETER. No; I don't know anything about this fact. But 
I know something about another fact of the same nature. 
Mr. MORRIS. Will you tell us what that was? 
The INTERPRETER. This concerns a certain Polish private who tried 
to go abroad who was caught and who was killed in Poland. 
'kr. MORRIS. He was killed when his escape failed? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes; after he tried to escape. 
Mr. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, we have not been able to get any verifi-
cation of the information which Mr. Petrov has given, namely, that he 
had heard that Barsov had been executed after he went back to Russia. 
If so, it is an important fact for us to establish, Senator. 
Would you tell us about the propaganda that was being made in 
Poland from sources in the United States such as the labor-research 
group and the output of the United Electrical and Radio Machine 
Workers in the United States? 
The INTERPRETER. These two organizations which you mentioned, 
sir, they are fundamental, they are basic sources of anti-American 
propaganda, not only in Poland but all over the Soviet bloc. 
If you are interested, I could give you countless instances in which 
statistics, for instance, of these two organizaitons are being used over 
there in an anti-American propaganda campaign. 
For instance materials prepared by the United Electrical Workers 
are mimeographed. They were sent to Poland; they were discussed 
at the Central Committee of the Polish Communist Party, and they 
were recommended then to different agencies for use in order to falsify 
life in America.

1586 SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES 
I would like to indicate why the material of these two organizations 
is so important in Poland. 
The party in Poland realized that many people in Poland do not 
believe them any more. 
Then the party distributes the material prepared by these two 
organizations, saying, "You know, this is American material, pre-
pared in America, written by Americans. We have nothing to do 
with it in this case." Of course, people believe it. 
For instance, I remember there were discussions with Soviet officers, 
party workers and others, and in these discussions very often when 
the factual material given by the Soviet propaganda was challenged, 
the Soviets would say again "Here we have material which is coming 
from the United States. You cannot put this in doubt." We quote 
it. And naturally, they close the mouth of anybody who does not 
believe their propaganda. 
Mr. MORRIS. Mr. Mandel, will you identify for the record the Labor 
Research Association? 
Mr. MANDEL. It has been cited by Attorney General Tom Clark 
on December 4, 1947. It is known as a direct auxiliary of the Com-
munist Party. It publishes labor fact books and economic releases 
for the Communist press, and it is headed by two leading Communists, 
Grace Hutchins and Robert Dunn. 
Mr. MORRIS. Mr. Mandel, you describe it as a direct auxiliary of 
the Communist Party. They do not bill themselves as such, though, 
do they? 
Mr. MANDEL. NO; they do not. 
Mr. Moiaurs. They do not acknowledge that they are a Communist 
source ? do they? 
Mr. MANDEL. They do not. 
Mr. MORRIS. Has he finished 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, sir. I explained to him what you were 
saying. 
Mr. MORRIS. Now, I wondered, were you in Poland when Swiatlow's 
defection and subsequent broadcasts were beamed to Poland? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, sir; I was in Poland at this time. 
Mr. MORRIS. Did you know Swiatlow at all before he defected? 
The INTERPRETER. No; I never met him. 
Mr. MORRIS. What was the effect of his defection in Poland? 
The INTREPETER. In this respect, first, it is very obvious to me that 
one could not say that Swiatlow's defection was a cause for all personal 
changes which are taking place in Poland now. 
But naturally, his defection contributed to these changes very lately. 
The first importance of Swiatlow's defection was that the party and 
the Government had been forced to reveal very many details concern-
ing those men they liquidated later which otherwise they would not 
be forced to reveal. 
In addition, all this which American radios different stations from 
abroad, all this information supplied on Swiatlow's material, of course, 
they opened the eyes of many people in Poland concerning the real 
nature of the Communist Government in Poland. 
In this respect, for instance, I remember such an interesting detail: 
The foreign radio is beamed generally in Warsaw. But you can 
listen to it in the suburbs of Warsaw. At the time of Swiatlow's

SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES IOW 
broadcasts to Poland, there were literally huge crowds of people who 
were trying to get to the suburban houses evidently to listen on the 
radio to what Swiatlow was saying. 
Swiatlow's defection and the broadcasts he was giving here caused 
great nervousness amonff. the governmental and party officials. 
Could I assure you that if Bierut were ill and had heart trouble at 
that time, no doubt one of the causes of his heart trouble was Swiatlow. 
Mr. MORRIS. Do you recall the visit of Boris Polevoj to the United 
States ? He had a group of political writers. I think it was the 
summer of 1955. 
The INTERPRETER. There were several things which are interesting 
in respect to Polevoj and Bierazkow?there are several things which 
I would like to mention. They gave interviews here in the United 
States. The nature of those interviews was such that they were not 
published in Poland. They were not allowed to be published in 
Mr. MORRIS. You mean, what they said over here?
The INTERPRETER. Was not allowed to be published in Poland. 
Mr. MORRIS. Why was that? Was it so obviously false? 
The INTERPRETER. The reason why those interviews could not be 
published in Poland was this: Polevoj gave so many lies concerning 
the life behind the Iron Curtain that if his lies would be reprinted in 
Poland, evidently not only would nobody believe in it, but this would 
result in a contrary opinion. The public opinion would learn how 
the Polish and the Soviet regimes are misguiding the Western World. 
For instance, I remember such a case: Polevoj's interview was mime-
ographed and distributed among i the members of the central com-
mittee of the Communist Party n the district of Cracow, and this 
was distributed only among the party workers. When the party 
authorities in Warsaw learned about it, they criticized very much the 
decision of the party organization in Cracow. They criticized the 
activities of the director of propaganda of the Communist Party in 
Cracow. 
It was the first case in which an interview of a Communist given 
abroad, outside of the Soviet bloc, was banned within the Soviet bloc. 
Chairman EASTLAND. We will take the rest of it in executive session. 
Mr. MORRIS. Mr. Bialer, Senator Eastland has to terminate the hear-
ing at this particular time. He has asked if we would continue on to 
take the testimony in executive session later on this afternoon, and. 
then put that executive session testimony in the public record at some 
date later in the week. 
Chairman EASTLAND. Mr. Bialer, we will take the rest of your testi-
mony in executive session. It will later be released. 
I want to thank you, sir. I think your testimony points up the 
importance of defectors and how helpful they are to our Government. 
They are something that we should certainly encourage.

Mr. Monars. Would you tell us about it? 
The INTERPRETER. I Will tell you you about those schools I know 
personally. 
There is a school in the suburbs of East Berlin where they train 
Communist workers for Western Germany. 
This is a very secret school, guarded by the police. Nobody has 
any access to it. 
The school had been organized in the woods, and it is completely 
unavailable to any kind of public. 
I lectured at that school in 1955; in June 1955. 
The subject of the education in that school is, first, how to carry 
on Communist activities in the West; then also other things like mili-
tary training included. 
In respect to the military training, I remember, for instance, in 
1955 that there were special courses on how to get into the Army in 
Western Germany. There were classes, lectures, on how to get into 
and work with the Western German Army. 
Those who lecture in that school are both Communists from the 
Western part of Germany, and of course, Communists from East 
Germany. 
The second school?
Mr. MORRIS. What was the name of that first school? 
The INTERPRETER. This was a secret school without any name. 
This was a school just for the party apparatus in Eastern Germany, 
for the party members from West Germany trained in that school. 
The second school I was acquainted with personally was a higher 
school, a party school in Moscow. 
The school is housed in the same building where, before, the 
Comintern was operating, the schools of the Comintern. 
At that school, which is mainly for the Soviet Communists, there 
are also special groups consisting of Western Communists, of the 
Communists outside of the Soviet bloc. 
There are classes where there are German, East and West German, 
Communists, French, and others, Polish, Czechoslovak, German, East 
and West. 
As far as Western Communists are concerned, there are not as many 
of them and they form special classes for them, and also, from the 
conspirAional point of view, probably it would not be good to have 
large clases for them. 
This is why this kind of Communists in the West, they are dis-
tributed under false names among other groups in the groups of the 
Russian Communists. 
Mr. MORRIS. And where was this second group held? 
The INTERPRETER. In MOSCOW. 
Mr. Mom's. In what building? 
The INTERPRETER. I don't remember the street; in the building where 
formerly the Comintern schools were operating. 
The fact that in that building there is this particular school is public 
knowledge. Of course, people do not know what happens there. 
The fact of the existence of the school is publicly known. 
Mr. MORRIS. Now, do you know about the case of Herman Field? 
The INTERPRETER. Well, I would like to give you some information 
about what the party people were saying after Herman Field was 
released.

So first, the second man in importance at that time in the Communist 
Party, Berman, was saying that Herman Field was a naive, innocent 
man, that he was arrested unjustly. 
Mr. MORRIS. Unjustly from the Communist point of view? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes; that he was not guilty; that he was naive, 
and not guilty. 
Mr. Mona's. "Guilt" in this case being spying for the Americans? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes. 
The second version concerning Herman Field was being spread in 
more narrow party circles, and it was spread by Ochab, the present 
first secretary of the Polish Communist Party. 
And his version was such that the crimes committed by the previous 
administration were of such magnitude that not only innocent people 
could have been arrested but also that people who were guilty, their 
affairs were so mixed up, so confused, that they had to be released. 
Mr. Mown& Did you ever see Herman Field? 
The INTERPRETER. NO, sir; only pictures. 
But I met his wife at some friends' before he was arrested. 
Mr. MORRIS. What year was that? 
The INTERPRETER. Most probably?it is difficult to remember?it 
was 1948. 
I saw her in the house of a certain George Durac and his wife. It 
was in the suburbs of Warsaw, called Zoliborz. 
By the way, the wife of that,Durac was later arrested and spent sev-
eral years in jail because of her connections with Herman Field. 
She was a secretary to Berman, and she contacted Field and Berman. 
Mr. MORRIS. Did you know anything about the Katyn Forest 
massacre? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes. 
There were very few people, actives of the Polish Communist Party, 
who wouldn't believe that the Russians did it. 
Their opinion, nevertheless, was divided, of those who believed the 
Russians did it, and it was divided following two lines: Some of them 
were say that the Russians were right doing it; others were saying that 
the Russians were wrong having done it. 
Mr. MORRIS. But they all agreed that the Russians did it? 
The INTERPRETER. But all agreed that the Russians did it. 
But I must stress until I left Poland, no efforts were seen to reveal 
it or to declare that the Russians did it. On the contrary, if anyone 
would make such statements openly, the party would immediately 
suppress the statement. 
Mr. MORRIS. Where were you at that time? That was in 1940, was 
it not? 
The INTERPRETER. Katyn, 1940. I was in Poland at that time. 
Mr. MORRIS. And you know nothing about it personally? 
Mr. BIALER. No. 
Mr. MORRIS. Could you tell us something about the fall of Molotov 
and the rise of Shepilov ? 
The INTERPRETER. First, Molotov fell, not in June 1956, but rather 
in July 1955. 
In July 1955 there was a _plenum of the central committee, and at 
that plenum practically Molotov was separated from any important 
work of the party.

Mr. Momus. How do you know that? 
The INrEaruETER. I know it from the minutes of that particular 
plenum, which was sent to the party in Poland, to the political bureau 
of the Polish Communist Party. 
As it was indicated by the party at that time, the main reason for 
Molotov's downfall was his disagreement with the Soviet policy with 
regard to Yugoslavia. 
There were also other reasons as given by the party why Molotov 
had to go. Of course, the most important reason was, among others, 
the personal struggle for power within the party. 
Mr. MORRIS. When you say that Molotov 's position with respect to 
Yugoslavia was the reason, what was his position with respect to 
Yugoslavia? 
The INTERPRETER. I mean that Molotov did not approve of estab-
lishing party relations with Yugoslavia. 
He was saying that the Yugoslavian Party was not a Communist 
Party and consequently there was no sense to establishing relations. 
Khrushchev did not agree with Molotov. He agreed with him as 
to the nature of the Yugoslavian Communist Party, but his argument 
was that if we do not establish relations with them, we will be unable 
to get them into the Soviet bloc. 
Mr. Mourns. Now, do you know to what extent the absorption of 
Yugoslavia back into the Soviet bloc, to what extent that has taken 
place? 
The INTERPRETER. Throughout the last year there were efforts being 
made for establishing relations between different countries of the 
Soviet bloc and Yugoslavia. 
In order to get this rapprochement, for instance, orders were given 
in the Polish Communist ?"arty against any criticism of Tito. 
Mr. MORRIS. You mean the Polish Communist Party was forbidden 
to criticize Tito? 
The INTERPRETER. To criticize Tito. 
Mr. Moult's. In what year was this, now? 
The INTERPRETER. In 1955. 
I have in mind public criticism of Tito. 
As far as the actual state of affairs was concerned, it was different. 
I ran across 2 members of the Polish delegation, 2 chairmen of the 
Polish delegations to Yugoslavia. The name of one was Wolynsky, 
and the second one was Wolpe. 
After their return to Poland, openly they restrained themselves 
from any criticism of Tito and Yugoslavia. 
At the same time, there was a meeting of the active of the Polish 
Central Committee, and at that meeting the same two men were criti-
cizing very sharply Yugoslavia and Tito. 
The same applies to the economic state of affairs in Yugoslavia. In 
general, I would say the policy was such: 
"Tito is a friend; Tito is an enemy." 
Mr. MORRIS. In other words, Tito no longer represents Titoism? 
The INTERPRETER. No. This means that Tito, as the chief of state, 
and Yugoslavia, as a country, the Soviet Union wants to get them 
into collaboration but the system which is prevailing in Yugoslavia, 
they do not want collaboration,
have this system in other satellite countries.

Until I left Poland, this border separating the Soviet communism 
and Yugoslavian type communism was still not passed. And as far 
as I remember, this border is the limit of the so-called political thaw 
in Poland. 
Mr. MORRIS. I did not understand that last. 
The INTERPRETER. This distinction between the Communist Party 
in the Communist bloc and the system prevailing now in Yugoslavia, 
the distinction between these two, this is the limit of the so-called 
thaw. 
Mr. MORRIS. That is, the. limit of the thaw? 
The INTERPRETER. The limit of the thaw. 
Mr. MoRms. Now, what then is your interpretation of Tito's recent 
visit to Moscow, currently? 
The INTERPRETER. Before I answer your question, sir, I would like 
to say this: 
At that meeting in July 1955 I remember Mikoyan at a certain mo-
ment told Molotov: 
At the present not only do we hope to bring Tito to our Soviet bloc; we are 
sure we will get him. 
I think that this was not achieved yet. 
So the last visit of- Tito in Moscow in a way is a payment for the 
Soviet benevolence, for the downgrading of Stalin, for the last stage 
of the Soviet policy. 
But as far as I know, still Yugoslavia did not become a Soviet sat-
ellite. It is still independent. 
Mr. Mamas. That will be all at this time. 
(Whereupon, at 3: 50 p. in., the subcommittee adjourned.)

Present: Senator Welker. 
Also present: Robert Morris, chief counsel, Benjamin Mandel, re-

Senator WELKER. The hearing will come to order. The first witness 
will be sworn. 
Mr. MORRIS. Will you swear, Dr. Karski, please, before swearing the 
witness. 
Senator WELKER. You will be sworn as the interpreter. 
Do you solemnly swear that you will take the questions propounded 
to you by the committee in English and correctly translate them into

Mr. BIALER.i I do. 
Mr. MORRIS. Mr. Bialer has testified previously before the Senate 
Internal Security Subcommittee. He has been recalled today because 
of the revolt that took place at Poznan yesterday. He is trying to 
determine for this public record whether there are any implications or 
aspects of the uprising in Poznan may have a bearing on our internal 
security in the United States. 
I wonder if you would repeat for the record, very briefly, Mr. Bialer,

'Western propaganda in Poland. I was the first secretary of the party 
organization in the highest ideological party schools in Poland. I was 
an ideological adviser to the party central organ, People's Tribune; 
and I held several other positions in the ideological sector of political 
life. 
Mr. MORRIS. I think you toldus once before, Mr. Bialer, that you 
were one of a group of three top propagandists in charge of anti-
American and anti-Western propaganda. 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, sir. 
Mr. MORRIS. Are you acquainted with, are you conversant with the 
revolt that took place in Poznan in the last few days? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes; I know what was given by the press. 
Mr. Moruus. How much of the situation in and about Poznan and 
Warsaw generally are you conversant with, with respect to this par-
ticular uprising? 
The INTERPRETER. Could you give me, sir, a few minutes so I could 
give my evaluation of the recent happenings in Poland? 
Mr. MORRIS. Yes; that is what we would very much like to have. 
The INTERPRETER. The last 3 years were being called all over in 
Poland as the period of the thaw. In that period, really, certain 
liberalization of the Communist terror was taking place. 
Mr. MORRIS. You say there was a liberalization of the Polish Com-
munist terror taking place? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, sir ? it was a liberalization of the life in 
Poland and liberalization of the Communist mass terror in Poland. 
Mr. Momirs. This is as of what time? 
The INTERPRETER. That period after the death of Stalin, the begin-
ning was after the liquidation of Beria. The first period, from 1953 
until the end of 1954, I would call it a period of the thaw in baby 
clothes. 
Mr. MORRIS. I didn't understand that. 
The INTERPRETER. Period of the thaw in those baby clothes. 
Senator WELKER. Let's do a retake on that one. 
Mr. MORRIS. The Senator didn't understand it either, sir. 
The INTERPRETER. It was the period of the liberalization of the life 
in Poland in its primitive first original stage. 
The second period was from the end of 1954 until the time I left 
Poland?and I would call that period the medium stage, when the 
thaw was spreading all over Poland. 
Mr. MORRIS. What was spreading over? 
The INTERPRETER. The thaw. The liberalization of Poland. 
Mr. MORRIS. Thaw. That is an expression Mr. Bialer has used pre-
viously in which he refers to the relaxation of the terror on the part 
of the Polish Communists. 
You have referred that from the period, from 1951 until the time 
you left Poland, which was on January 31, 1956, that this was the 
intermediate stage, this was where the thaw was beginning to show? 
The INTERPRETER. Spreading; yes. The present stage of that re-
laxation period I would call it a stage of a stormy period. 
Mr. MORRIS.- This is the third period of relaxation. 
The INTERPRETER. The present one. 
Mr. Moms. You describe that as a stormy period. 
The INTERPRETER. Stormy period; yes.

SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES 1595 
I was asking myself a question and I am sure that others in Poland 
were asking themselves that question, "What is the origin of that so-
called relaxation in Poland?" There is only one answer, which I 
could prove by hundreds of facts. Some of those facts concern the 
highest party authorities. 
The short answer is such, the essence of the present period of the 
so-called liberalization is unprecedented in this history of commu-
nism, pressure exercised by the Communists themselves on the party 
leadership for more relaxation and secondly the pressure?
Mr. Moms. See if we understand the first one? 
The essence of this relaxation is the unprecedented demand for 
liberalization, on the part of the Communists themselves against the 
Party leaders? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes sir. That is the first one. The second as-
pect is the pressure of the nation, of the people, on the government 
for the same purpose. 
Mr. Moan's. And the second aspect of it is the people themselves, 
as opposed to the Communists, are also exerting pressure on the 
Polish leaders for a liberalization? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, sir. 
I would like to give you some facts concerning such a matter, how 
the leadership of the party was opposing the pressure for liberaliza-
tion, and how the leadership of the parry was forced to cede step by 
step to liberalize the life. 
Mr. MORRIS. This now, if I may understand your testimony, is fact-
ual. This is from your own personal experience with the Polish 
Communists? 
The INTERPRETER. It is; I said, on the basis of my personal ex-
periences, experiences particularly in the last 3 years. I was taking 
part in these activities. 
Mr. MORRIS. You say that, on the basis of this experience, there was 
opposition, on the part of the party leaders, to pressure for liberaliza-
tion? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, sir. 
Mr. Moanis. And you are going to tell us about this opposition on 
the part of the party leaders to the liberalization? 
- The INTERPRETER. Naturally, this problem is a very complex one, 
and I tried to write and elaborate on it and several pages took place. 
I will try to be as concise as possible. 
I will give you the first example. The Minister of Security and 
the main oppressor in Poland, Radkiewicz, R-a-d-k-i-e-w-i-c-z. 
Mr. MORRIS. That is R-a-d-k-i-e-w-i-c-z ? 
The INTERPRETER. That's right. 
Mr. MORRIS. He was the Minister of  
The INTERPRETER. Of Security. 
As at the beginning of 1954, after the crimes committed by the 
Security became known, an enormous pressure by the party member-
ships, as well as by the people as a whole, was being exercised. The 
pressure was that Radkiewicz had to go. 
Mr. MORRIS. He was eliminated? 
The INTERPRETER. The pressure was to eliminate him. 
Mr. MORRIS. Yes. 
The INTERPRETER. Until the end of 1954, at all party meetings, and 
I know since I participated in those meetings, the party leadership

1596 SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES 
was opposing such demands; was opposing even a discussion on this 
problem. 
At the very end of 1954, under the pressure even of the activists of 
the Communist Party, the leadership was forced to dismiss Radkie-
wicz as a Minister of Security and to demote him to a post of a 
Minister of Agriculture. 
Mr. MORRIS. May I repeat that again. 
As a result of the pressure exerted on the party leaders, including 
the pressure on the part of the leading activists of the party, the party 
leaders were forced to depose Radkiewicz and give him the assignment 
of the Minister of Agriculture? 
The INTERPRETER. That's right. 
Mr. MORRIS. When was he deposed? 
The INTERPRETER. The very end of 1954. 
However, even after that dismissal from the position of Minister of 
Security to the position of Minister of Agriculture, still he retained 
his position as a member of the Politburo of the Polish Communist 
Party. 
Mr. MORRIS. And even in his position as Minister of Agriculture, 
he retained his position as a member of the Politburo? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, sir. 
After that event, the pressure within the party to eliminate Rad-
kiewicz from the Politburo was continuing. I participated in several 
party meetings where the party membership was demanding openly a 
final elimination of Radkiewicz from any post. 
Mr. Moult's. Now you participated in Communist Party meetings 
where the rank and file of the party continued their pressure to have 
Radkiewicz?his membership in the Politburo taken away from him? 
The INTERPRETER. That is correct. 
Again, I want to stress at that period the leadership of the party, 
Bierut, g-i-e-r-u-t ; Berman, B-e-r-m-a-n ; and Ochab, 0-c-h-a-b, were 
doing their best to preserve Radkiewicz and to preserve his influence. 
Nevertheless, the summer of 1955 came, and at the secret meeting of 
the Central Committee of the Polish Communist Party, Radkiewicz, 
supposedly on his own initiative, resigned from his post. 
Mr. Momus. May I recapitulate. In spite of the pressure on the 
part of the three top leaders of the Polish party, Bierut, Berman, and 
Ochab, despite the fact that they wanted him to remain on in the 
summer of 1955, at a secret meeting, a secret Communist meeting, 
Radkiewicz offered his resignation? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, sir. 
Senator WELKER. I am going to get to a little more current events. 
You are aware, are you, of the revolt going on in Poland as of this 
moment at Poznan? 
The INTERPRETER. I was giving you certain facts in order to make 
a background for the present happenings. 
Senator WELKER. I understand that. 
Will you answer my question? You are aware of that revolt going 
on now? 
The INTERPRETER. Naturally, I possess only information which I 
received from the American press. I do not have any other direct 
information. 
Senator WELKER. I think we are all working from what we have 
read in the press.

SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES 1597 
Now, based upon your experience in the Communist Party, did you 
expect the Polish people to arise and have a revolution as early as of 
this date? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes; I was expecting them to a great extent, and 
in addition, too, I consider that they are a logical outcome of the pre-
vious development of the situation in Poland. 
Senator WELKER. There is no question in your mind but what the 
people in Poland are God-fearing, freedom-loving people and want 
their freedom restored to them? 
The INTERPRETER. I have no doubt, sir, of any kind to this question. 
Senator WELKER. What significance do you attach to the press re-
lease that the Polish people in their uprising were crying, "We want 
bread; bread." Does that mean that they were hungry, that the Com-
munist Party was not feeding them? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes; they were claiming the amelioration of the 
economic situation in Poland, their standard of living which is pres-
ently extremely low in Poland, tragically low. 
Senator WELKER. Tragically low? 
The INTERPRETER. Tragically low. 
Senator WELKER. And the Communists work the Poles very hard, 
do they? 
The INTERPRETER. The workers in Poland work extremely hard un-
der orders of the party, I was making certain statistics while in Poland. 
The standard of living of the Polish workers, according to my re-
search, is 31/2 times lower than the standard of living of the workers 
in Germany?Western Germany. 
Mr. Mom's. The standard of living is 31/2 times lower than the 
standard of living of workers in Western Germany? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, sir. 
However, I would like to draw your attention, sir, that what is 
i 
happening n Poznan should not be considered only as an economic 
activity. The background is economic. However, every activity of 
this kind in a Communist-controlled state has political aspirations in 
view, and are being suppressed as political opposition. 
Senator WELKER. Now, they are seeking freedom. Isn't that 
correct? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, sir. 
Senator WELKER. I notice in the afternoon edition of a prominent 
Washington newspaper that the Warsaw radio announced that 38 
people were killed and 270 wounded in this well-organized revolt at 
Poznan. 
Do you assume for a moment, sir, that this uprising has ended as 
of now, or do you think that it will still be brewing and last for years 
to come until they get their freedom? 
The INTERPRETER. I believe that it is very possible that riots of this 
kind, although on a smaller scale, will be repeated in other localities. 
However, I believe that riots to such an extent will not be repeated in 
the immediate future. 
Senator WELKER. That last answer was?I didn't get that. 
The INTERPRETER. That riots so serious as those in Poznan, on a 
mass scale, will not be repeated elsewhere. 
Mr. MORRIS. You say there will be some other riots, but not of the 
extent of this one. 
The INTERPRETER. Yes.

Senator WELKER. And that is because the people of Poland have 
nothinc, but their fists to fight with in the form of arms. Is that it? 
The ''INTERPRETER. Yes sir; first of all because the Polish nation 
from the times of the end of the war' had no possibilities to express 
their will in any way. They couldn't vote, and they have no other 
technical way to express their-will. 
Senator WELKER. And of course they have little to look forward 
to when they, with their hands, have to combat tanks of the size you 
see here in the picture of the newspaper I am showing you, huge 
tanks which are shooting down those people which are uprising. 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, this is the reason. 
Senator WELKER. Now, directing your attention to the newspaper 
which I am sending you, Mr. Witness, the second picture after the 
picture of the tanks and the people, I am asking you whether or not 
there is any significance to the flag that is flying over the people, 
which would appear to the Senator from Idaho to be of rather serious 
concern. Is there any significance to that flag flying there? 
Mr. KARSKI. May I read the caption to him? 
Senator WELKER. Go right ahead, Doctor. 
The INTERPRETER. The Polish flag has two colors, white and red, 
the national Polish flag. It looks to me that this flag has also some 
two- colors, and it looks like white and some blood stain which prob-
ably symbolizes to them the national_flao.. 
Mr. Momus. When you say the Poesh national flag, do you mean 
the national flag of the current government of Poland or the previous 
government? 
The INTERPRETER. The previous government has the same flag, ex-
cept the same flag as the flag before the war. But nevertheless, for 
the Polish nation, the white and the red color symbolizes the Polish 
national color and symbolizes the freedom of Poland. 
Senator WELKER. Now, based upon your experience as a former 
Communist agent in Poland, based upon the knowledge you have 
learned from the press, is it a safe assumption that what is going on 
in Poland yesterday and today?and .we hope forever, without the 
loss of life and injury to those patriots?would it be safe to say that 
other freedom-loving satellite countries have the same unrest and 
same freedom urge that the Poles are evidencing now? i - 
The INTERPRETER. Before I left Poland, I was n touch with other 
nations behind the Iron Curtain, and I came to the conclusion that the 
desire for freedom is the same although that campaign for achieving 
more liberalization was carried on in Poland on a larger scale than 
in other satellite-countries. 
Mr. MORRIS. You say the desire for liberalization and the willing-
ness to express pressure to bring about liberalization was stronger in 
Poland than it wasin the other satellite countries, even though%ased 
on your travels in the other satellite countries, you did recognize 
there was this desire for liberalization and this unrest? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, sir. 
Senator WELKER. I have one concluding question, Doctor, that you 
might interpret to the witness-. 
f will ask you if it isn't a fact that the Polish freedom-loving people 
who have suffered, some-killed, some wounded and some very unhappy, 
and those who have been in this revolt as they call it?had they had

SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES 1599 
the arms or the armaments or the tools to work with?I will ask you 
if it isn't a fact that they would have turned against the Communist 
and shot him dead wherever they saw him in Poland? 
The INTERPRETER. Well, I couldn't tell you, of course, if they were 
armed or not in this particular riot in Poznan, since I have no way 
to know, but I can tell you,. on the basis of my personal experience, 
that Polish Communist polce do not hesitate to kill people in this 
kind of riot anywhere. 
Senator WELKER. I think we have misunderstood each other. I am 
referring now to this fact, would the Polish people who have been 
revolting against this tyranny?would they have any reluctance to 
shoot down the Communists and the secret police had they had the 
arms to do it with? 
The INTERPRETER. In the present situation, where there is no democ-
racy and no rights' and where the governmental control over the 
people is extended to all walks of life?first of all, there is no possi-
bility that the people would get arms. It is physically impossible. 
Senator WELKER. I understand that, but mine was a hypothetical 
question based upon the fact if they could get arms, would they use 
them? 
The INTERPRETER. If they had arms I firmly believe that the great 
part of the Polish nation, most of le Polish nation, would fight 
against the regime. 
Mr. MORRIS. You believe that if they did have arms a great part 
of the Polish people, in fact most of the Polish people, would take 
up arms against the Polish Communist leaders? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes. I mean the part greater than that those 
who support communism. 
Mr. MORRIS. It is the majority. 
The INTERPRETER. Yes. 
Mr. MORRIS. Mr. Bialer, I wonder if you could tell us what hap-
pened after the secret meeting in 1955 when the pressure became so 
great that Mr. Radkiewicz had to resign from the membership in the 
Politburo in the Polish Communist Party? 
The INTERPRETER. May I draw your attention, sir, that Radkiewicz 
resigned from his position in the middle of 1955, but the party leader-
ship withheld that information from the people and from the party 
membership. I am sure that even today, the people in Poland and 
the party membership do not know that he was dismissed as early 
as in the middle of 1955. 
Senator WELKER. I think that would be a rather wholesome thing 
to broadcast to the people of Poland, don't you, that he was forced 
to resign in the middle of the summer of 1955? 
The INTERPRETER. I tried my best, sir, exactly to do this. 
Mr. MORRIS. Then' does that complete the background or do you 
have more aspects of this background leading up to the interpretation 
of the present situation? 
The INTERPRETER. From those examples which I gave you, and I 
have hundreds of other examples, the main point is that the Polish 
nation and the party membership are continuously exercising a pres-
sure for more liberalization. The party leadership is and was opposing 
that pressure and only being forced to accept the principle that more 
liberalization should be introduced.

The Poznan riot was one of many efforts on the part of the Polish 
workers to attain, to force the party to bring more liberalization and 
higher standards of living, and a change in the national position in 
Poland. 
Mr. MORRIS. Your interpretations, Mr. Bialer, that the ever-extend-
ing pressure for liberalization, which you have described in great 
detail through the years, has been the direct cause or contributing 
cause to the present uprising? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, I am deeply convinced that it was so. 
Mr. MORRIS. Does the fact that the Polish national flag was un-
furled during the course of this demonstration indicate to you that 
the uprising was political in content rather than the demand for food? 
The INTERPRETER. Those riots basically were political, although, I 
repeat, under a Communist regime, economic demands and economic 
situation is a result of the political Communist rule. 
Mr. MORRIS. I wonder if I might ask this question?is there any 
possibility that this revolt may have been falsely stimulated by the 
Communist leaders in order to bring out any underground resistance 
that may exist in the Communist regime? 
The INTERPRETER. I don't believe, sir, in this. The price which the 
regime is paying for these riots, and the price is the loss of authority 
in Poland and the revelation before the whole world how terrible the 
situation is in Poland?the price is so great that they wouldn't be 
willing to pay it. 
Mr. ltiomas. The answer is the price is so great?in other words: a 
revelation to the whole world how bad the situation is in Communist 
Poland and the fact that there is so much resentment against the 
regime?that the price would not be worth the effort. You do not 
believe in that? 
The INTERPRETER. Absolutely, I do not believe it. 
Mr. MORRIS. Do you believe the Warsaw radio would announce that 
the revolt was of such proportions-38 killed and 270 wounded?if 
the revolt were not serious? 
The INTERPRETER. The fact that Warsaw admits that 38 people 
were killed and 270 wounded indicates to me, on the basis of m37 knowl-
edge of the Communist methods, that even the expression "serious" 
is too mild; too delicate. It means that this was a bloody battle which 
was waged in Poznan. 
Mr. MORRIS. Do you know anything of a revolt that took place be-
tween the Polish people and the Soviet occupation forces in a town 
Szczecin in 1951? I believe that is the Polish for Stettin, is it not? 
The INTERPRETER. Yes sir; I have knowledge about it. 
Mr. MORRIS. Will you tell us briefly what happened at that time? 
The INTERPRETER. In 1951, a Soviet officer shot a Polish lady. This 
provoked an outstanding part of the Polish population in Stettin, an 
outrage and outbreak, which was being hidden by the Communist 
regime for many years. As a result, there were outbreaks in Stettin; 
there were public demonstrations, and naturally, as a consequence, 
reprisals on the part of the regime. All of them were being concealed 
from the Polish people. However I would like to stress here that at 
that time2 it was much easier for the regime to curb those riots because 
the security organs were much stronger than they are today.

SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE 'MUTED STATES 1601 
Mr. MORRIS. Mr. Bialer, could you tell us what you feel the United 
States policies should be now, with respect to this expressed desire on 
the part of the Polish people to gain the liberation of control. 
The INTERPRETER. First of all, SlT, I believe that the most important 
thing in this field is this: Let the American people convince the Polish 
people that they first sympathize with them, and secondly, that the 
Americans will never reconcile themselves with the loss of freedom 
in Poland. 
Mr. MORRIS. Let the American people know that they sympathize 
with the Polish people and that they will never reconcile themselves 
to the loss of freedom on the part of the polish people. 
The INTERPRETER. Let the Polish people know it. 
Mr. MORRIS. Let the Polish people know that the Americans sym-
pathize with their feeling that they will never reconcile themselves to 
the loss of their freedom? 
The INTERPRETER. I want to stress very, very strongly this fact. The 
Polish Communist Party and the Polish Communist regime are doing 
everything possible to silence the Western World and the Americans 
not to let them?to stop them?saying the truth about the situation 
in Poland. 
Mr. MORRIS. The Communist leaders are doing everythina6 possible 
in order to cause the leaders of the West and the people of the West not 
to express themselves on these subjects. 
The INTERPRETER. Yes, to such a degree that I would put it in such 
a slogan it amounts to this: The Communist leaders in Poland are say-
ing to the Western World, very smartly, very cleverly, "Don't you 
criticize us in your radios and we will not jam your broadcasts." 
Mr. MORRIS. Should we continue to criticize them? 
The INTERPRETER. Naturally, if we stop the campaign of criticizing 
them and revealing the truth, this would mean a great help to them 
in their oppression of the Polish people. 
Mr. MORRIS. And therefore, a policy which would cause us to 
soften our criticism of the Polish overlords would be a bad policy for 
us to pursue? 
The INTERPRETER. I think that such a policy would be a very terrible 
policy as far as the Polish people are concerned, and in consequence 
would be a bad policy for the United States. 
Senator WELKER. Now, Mr. Witness, and Doctor, we thank you 
very much for your testimony here today. We are now going to con-
clude this phase of the hearing. It may be necessary that we reopen a 
hearing at a later date. 
The acting chairman wants to recognize the fact that the Internal 
Security Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee of the United 
States Senate is honored indeed to have today as its guest, Arthur Bliss 
Lane, former Ambassador to Poland and his lovely wife. As all of us 
know, Arthus Bliss Lane wrote the famous book, I Saw Poland Be-
trayed. There has come to my attention a press release this great man 
gave when he heard of the activities on the part of the oppressed 
people of Poland. I am going to read that into the record, if it is 
all right with you, Mr. Lane.

1602 SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES 
Senator WELKFR. I quote Arthur Bliss Lane in a statement he made 
yesterday: 
The reports which have come over the radio today regarding the riots in 
Poznan, the largest city In what used to be German Poland, are highly significant. 
The fact that the Polish official radio confirms these reports emphasizes the 
seriousness of the situation. This courageous action in Poznan may quite prob-
ably be followed by other acts of patriotic violence against Communist despotism 
not only in Poland but in other captive nations as well. 
Probably the Poles have taken advantage of the recent dramatic changes in 
the Soviet Union and the criticism of Khrushchev by foreign Communist parties 
which surely have been communicated to the various captive states, including 
Poland. The spirit of liberty of the Poles, which never in history has been 
completely quenched, has finally burst forth in a brave, although perhaps for the 
moment futile, attempt at liberation from their Communist masters who have 
been under the heel of Moscow since the puppet Lublin government was formed 
in Poland under Stalin's direction on July 21, 1944. Rokossovsky, the Minister 
of Defense, formerly a marshal in the Soviet Army, who was appointed to his 
present position by Stalin, will undoubtedly put down the insurrection with 
customary Communist cruelty. 
But regardless of the inevitable loss of life, the attempt is all to the good. 
We did not gain our independence without Washington having been willing to 
risk his life as well as those of his men. 
I do not place any credence in the relationship of this uprising to the recent 
visit of Tito to Moscow. I am not as naive as some persons in this country 
who hold to the fallacious theory that Tito represents a different type of com-
munism of the Trotskyist or Bukharin school. All forms of communism are the 
same. They are aimed at the destruction of all we hold dear: democracy, 
religion, and liberty, and specifically the overthrow of the United States. 
Therefore, all Americans should hall this bold revolution. It is in the interest 
of the liberation of Eastern Europe and of the security of the United States. 
God bless the Polish people. 
Arthur Bliss Lane that was a profound statement made by you yes-
terday. On behalf of Chairman Eastland and the entire subcommittee 
and its staff, we want to thank you for permitting us to use that as 
part of the record in this hearing, which is a hearing following one 
of the crucial things in the history of the modern world. 
Mr. Moms. We may have a staff session with Mr. Bialer and if we 
learn anything at that staff session, we can put it in the public record. 
Mr. BIALER (through the interpreter). May I add just one sentence, 
sir? 
Senator WELKER. Yes. 
The INTERPRETER. Could I tell you, I would symbolize what is hap-
pening now in Poland in such a way: There is a legend in Poland 
about a witch who liberated certain forces and then was unable to 
control them any more. This is what is happening in Poland. The 
Communist regime liberated certain forces in Poland to speak, and 
now it looks they can't control them any more. 
Senator WELKER. Thank you very much. 
The committee now stands adjourned. 
(Whereupon., at 2: 55 p. m., the subcommittee adjourned.)

leading activist and propagandist for the Central Committee of the Communist 
Party of Poland. He testified with regard to a wide range of subjects, including 
the activities of one Henry l'odolski. His testimony concerning Podolski follows: 
"Mr. Mocuus. Do you know Henry Podolski? 
"Mr. MORRIS (turning to the chairman). Mr. Chairman, Henry Podolski was 
the former editor in chief of Glos Ludowy, a Polish-Communist paper published 
in Detroit. 
WITNESS (through interpreter). Yes; I know Henry Podolski, Henry 
Podolski has two main assignments presently in Poland. The first one is to 
work in the campaign of repatriation of the Polish emigres, postwar emigres, 
In the West, and the second, to instruct the American paper People's Voice in 
Detroit. 
"Mr. MORRIS. You mean he is still running the Detroit newspaper? 
"WITNESS (through interpreter). This paper receives strict instructions from 
Poland, and he is the man who is sending them." 
According to our records Glos Ludowy (People's Voice) is a Polish language 
newspaper, published weekly at 5858 Chene Street, Detroit, Mich. It is the 
official organ of the PoIonia Society of the International Workers Order, which 
has been cited by the Attorney General as "one of the strongest Communist 
organizations." Henry Podolski was formerly its editor in chief. Throughout 
its existence Glos Ludowy has never failed to follow the line of the ComrRunist 
Party, as a study of its issues will show. 
In the light of this testimony, the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee 
feels that a new problem has been posed which we present to you for such action 
as may in your judgment be warranted: namely, the existence in this country 
of a publication conducted under the proven direction of an agent of the Com-
munist Government of Poland.

Hon. HERBERT BROWNELL, Jr., 
Attorney General of the United States, Department of Justice, 
Washington, D. C. 
DEAR MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL: I write this letter to ask your assistance in a 
matter that constitutes a serious present threat to the internal security of the 
United States. 
Seweryn Bleier, who was a leading Polish Communist until his defection a 
few months ago, recently told the Internal Security Subcommittee that propa-
ganda prepared by the United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers Union 
in the United States is the most effective propaganda device being used today 
by the Polish Communist leaders against their people. This propaganda is 
directed against America, and is further being used to keep the Polish people in 
bondage. 
Two of the leaders of this union have been James Matles and James Lustig. 
Both have been demonstrated to be Communists and both are the subject of 
denaturalization proceedings I believe that your, office filed denaturalization 
suits against them on February 13, 1952, and on December 16, 1952, respectively. 
Since that time apparently nothing has been done to enable the immigration 
authorities to follow up on their deportation proceedings. 
There is also the ease of Constantine Radzi, who our record shows has been 
a member of the control or disciplinary committee of the Communist Party. 
Radzi was observed watching one of our hearings in New York in 1952, and 
was subpenaed to testify. In that case, both the Immigration Service and the 
Department of Justice acted expeditiously and filed a denaturalization proceed-
ing on December 17, 1952, against Radzi. Since that time apparently nothing 
has been done on this case. Radzi is not even on bail, and is pursuing his work 
of undermining our Government without molestation. 
I further call your attention to the case of Louis Weinstock, against whom 
suit was filed on January 22, 1953, and to the cases of almost a score of other 
Communists who are still engaged in trying to destroy our way of life.

Twelve members of Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee, including my-
self, have signed the following statement for press statement begins the massacres 
and mass arrest in Poznan show that Poland is still a police state whose people 
are kept in subjection to totalitarian terror. 
Public comment from Communist leaders in other Soviet satellites to the 
effect that the Polish uprising proved the need for greater party vigilance is 
at least an indication that this is still the normal method of government through-
out the Communist world. 
The new leaders in the Kremlin now profess penitence for the misdeeds of 
the criminal Stalin. It should be remembered that Stalin's greatest crimes 
were committed not against the Russian people but against neighboring free 
people, particularly Poland, who were enslaved by force of Russian arms and 
have been kept in subjection by violence and electoral fraud.

SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES 1605 
The Kremlin confessions regarding Stalin's activities constitute new evidence 
justifying the reopening of the Polish case of 1945. 
Surely there is some international organization which will support the prin-
ciple of free and properly supervised elections in Poland. 
The Poznan uprising proves?if any further proof were needed?that there 
are still Poles who are willing to sacrifice their lives for their nation. 
The free world should not sit on the sideline while the unctuously penitent men 
In the Kremlin proceed to repeat Stalin's crimes of 1945 and apply the jackboot 
to Poland once again. 
We must protest against Communist methods and develop our protest into an 
effective demand for free elections in Poland. 
Meanwhile the press and radio of the world should not relax its efforts to 
expose the administrative and judicial terror being employed against the Polish 
people. 
We should demand the fullest and most factual account of the happening, 
and if press correspondents are denied freedom of movement in Poland and 
freedom of access to the accused, the world should know about it and protest 
accordingly. 
The methods adopted by the Communist authorities in Poznan throw a lurid 
light on the insincerity of the Kremlin much advertised change of heart.

Hon. JOHN FOSTER DULLES,

Washington, D. C. 
DEAR MR. SECRETARY: On June 29, 1956, Seweryn Bialer testified before the 
Senate Internal Security Subcommittee in connection with the recent riots in 
Poznan, Poland. As you know, Mr. Bleier was, until January 31 of this year, 
a member of the Central Committee of the Polish Communist Party, specializing 
in anti-Western and anti-American propaganda. 
Enclosed herewith, for your information, is a copy of the transcript of Mr. 
Bialer's testimony, setting forth important evidence concerning recent events 
In Poland. As his testimony shows, the Polish Communist leaders have been 
forced to permit a certain liberalization of conditions; and it is this, he states, 
which unleashed the forces that caused the Poznan uprising. 
I particularly call your atttention to the following colloquy near the close 
of Mr. Bialer's testimony (pp. 3413-3415) : 
"Mr. MORRIS. Mr. Bialer, could you tell us what you feel the United States 
policies would be now with respect to this expressed desire on the part of the 
Polish people to gain their liberation from control? 
"Mr. BIALER. First of all, sir, I believe that the most important thing in 
this field is this: Let the American people convince the Polish people first that 
they sympathize with them; and secondly, that the Americans will never 
reconcile themselves with the loss of freedom in Poland.

"Mr. DIALER. Let the Polish people know it. 
"Mr. MORRIS. Let the Polish people know that the Americans sympathize 
with their feeling that they will never reconcile themselves to the loss of their 
freedom? 
"Mr. BIALER. I want to stress very, very strongly this fact. The Polish 
Communist Party and the Polish Communist regime are doing everything pos-
sible to silence the Western world and the Americans, not to let them?to 
stop them?saying the truth about the situation in Poland. 
"Mr. MORRIS. The Communist leaders are doing everything possible in order 
to cause the leaders of the West and the people of the West not to express 
themselves on these subjects? 
"Mr. BIALEs. Yes; to such a degree that I would put it in such a slogan?it 
amounts to this: The Communist leaders in Poland are saying to the Western 
world, very smartly, very cleverly, 'Don't you criticize us in your radios and 
we will not jam your broadcasts.' 
"Mr. MORRIS. Should we continue to criticize them? 
"Mr. BIALER. Naturally, if we stop the campaign of criticizing them and 
revealing the truth, this would mean a? great help to them in their oppression 
of the Polish people. 
"Mr. Moss's. And therefore, that is?a policy which would cause us to soften 
our criticism of the Polish overlords would be a bad policy for us to pursue? 
"Mr. BIALER. I think that such a policy would be a very terrible policy as far 
as the Polish people are concerned, and in consequence would be a bad policy 
for the United States." 
I have taken the liberty of setting forth this particular portion of Mr. Bialer's 
testimony, because I believe it sheds important light upon an issue of policy 
concerning which there has been a great deal of debate in recent months. 
On all sides we hear it said nowadays, that America should take the lead in 
relaxing international tensions, as a means of promoting the goal of world peace. 
To this end, it has been suggested that the United States should modify the 
tone of its broadcasts to the captive nations of Eastern Europe, to avoid giving 
any possible offense to the Communist overlords of those areas. Mr. Bialer's 
testimony serves to emphasize how ill-advised such a course would be, and what 
dreadful consequences it might have, both for the Polish people and for the 
United States. 
I therefore express the hope, Mr. Secretary, that nothing will deter this coun-
try from speaking with fearless candor to the oppressed populations behind the 
Iron Curtain. Only from us can they hear the truth, and only the truth can 
make them free. 
Sincerely yours, 
JAMES 0. EASTLAND, 
Chairman, Internal Security Subcommittee. 
JULY 11, 1956. 
DEAR SENATOR EASTLAND : Thank you for sending me a copy of the letter which 
you sent to the Secretary of State on July 2, 1956, concerning part of Seweryn 
Bialer's testimony before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee. As you 
may know, the United States Information Agency has made extensive use of 
Interviews with Mr. Bialer. 
With regard to the colloquy in which Mr. Bialer advised the American people 
to convince the Polish people that Americans sympathize with them and will 
never reconcile themselves to loss of freedom in Poland, I can assure you that 
the Agency endeavors to exploit all suitable opportunities to emphasize these 
points. The following are typical of the numerous applicable statements that 
are being broadcast to Iron Curtain countries: 
"* * * May 3 is the day on which this country and the people of Poland renew 
a mutual faith in freedom, and in the strong bonds of friendship and common 
purpose which unite us across all the barriers the Iron Curtain imposes"?
Department of State statement on Polish Constitution Day. 
"* * * The peaceful liberation of the captive peoples has been, is and, until 
success is achieved, will continue to be a major goal of United States foreign 
policy"?White House statement. 
"* * * We believe that all free peoples will be watching the situation closely to 
see whether or not the Polish people will be allowed a government which will 
remedy the grievances which have brought them to a breaking point"?Depart-
went of State statement on the Poznan demonstrations.

SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE 'UNITED STATES 1607 
Since your letter to the Secretary of State also mentions the Poznan uprising, 
I think you would be interested in knowing that the Agency's treatment of this 
subject highlights sympathetic reaction from the United States and elsewhere. 
Our treatment has also been drawing upon the heavy flow of eyewitness 
accounts, news reports, and commentaries that (1) show the uprising as a 
manifestation of legitimate grievances arising from conditions that are typical 
of East European regimes, (2) interpret the uprising as an act of desperation 
stemming from privations while the U. S. S. R. and the satellites are making 
grandiose offers of aid to nonbloc countries, (3) offer more evidence that the 
satellite regimes constitute dictatorial minority rule, and (4) again underline 
the importance of permitting all people to enjoy the right to live under govern-
ments of their own choosing. 
I believe these lines, which are being applied to a familiar current develop-
ment, accord fully with the points brought out in the aforementioned colloquy. 
I can also assure you that the policy of the Agency calls for a consistent, 
vigorous presentation of the truth to the captive peoples of Eastern Europe. 
This policy will continue. The determinant factors in the tone and content of 
the Agency's output to these peoples are the attainment of national policy 
objectives of the United States and the means considered most likely to be pro-
ductive for this purpose. 
Sincerely yours,

statement by Communist Party of the United States declaring its "independence 
from Moscow." This is a synthetic declaration ordered by Moscow. Under 
instructions of Moscow, the British, Italian, and French Communist Parties and 
Europe's No. 1 fellow traveler, Pietro Nenni, have also made such declarations. 
Other Communist Parties have since then done likewise. 
Quite naturally, one is tempted to ask: How can Moscow order supposedly 
Independent parties functioning in other countries what to do? And why should 
MOFCOW resort to such a weird way of doing things? 
These questions appear baffling to many in the free world because they tend 
to apply to Communist Parties the yardsticks and standards they employ in 
judging organizations which are political parties in the democratic sense of the 
word. 
No Communist Party is a political party in this sense. It is, therefore, neces-
sary, first of all, to examine the particular nature, the specific character, the 
peculiar features that distinguish the Communist Parties from other political 
parties in the free world. 
The overriding and overwhelming preeminence of the Russian section of the 
international Communist movement has always been accepted by all other Com-
munist Parties and their fellow travelers. This is understandable. After all, 
the Russian Communists, led by Lenin, were the first to triumph in their revolu-
tion. This victory, the progress achieved in Soviet consolidation, and the Krem-
lin's increasingly important role in the international area have given the Russian 
Communists immeasurable authority and prestige among Communists and their 
followers throughout the world. 
For these reasons it has become almost second nature for Communists outside 
of the Soviet Union to echo and copy everything which the clique that happens 
to be dominant in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union says or does. For 
years, Communist parties everywhere have oriented themselves and behaved 
as auxiliaries of the already victorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union. 
Secondly, the dominant leader, or the ruling clique, of the Soviet Communist 
Party, at any particular moment, has always insisted on, and exploited, such

In 1929 he was expelled for fighting against Stalinism and has since then become one of 
the leading fighters against communism of every hue and stripe.

behavior of the Communist parties outside the Soviet borders for its own fac-
tional advantage and interests. As Russian Communist factional struggles 
became more violent and destructive, as inner party groups were defeated and 
annihilated, as the base of leadership in the Soviet Communist Party narrowed, 
this exploitation of the Communist parties outside the Soviet Union for enhanc-
ing the Kremlin's ruling clique interests became established Comintern practice 
and policy. 
Thus, in 1929, the leadership of the American Communist Party, which had 
the overwhelming support of the organization in the United States, was purged 
by Stalin himself. This Russian purge of the organization in the United States 
came primarily because these leaders were suspected of being sympathetic to 
Bukharin, then the principal ideological opponent of Stalin. 
After Stalin thus drove thousands of members out of the Communist Party 
of the United States, he went on to foist upon it a general secretary and other 
leaders who were his supine henchmen. The latter hastened to bail all the 
programs Stalin subsequently launched against his opponents in the Soviet 
Communist Party and throughout the Comintern. The other sections of the 
Comintern lost no time in imitating and copying the hooliganism of Stalin by 
mass party expulsions and drastic purges. 
After years of devastating faction struggles inside the Soviet Communist 
Party, it became a party of robots?a party of total political automation. Only 
Stalin and the small clique of yes-men around him counted. Stalin fully under-
stood what this robotization meant for the functioning, future behavior, and 
inner life of the Soviet Communist Party. That is why he had the 17th Party 
Congress (March 1939) abolish the mass purge. Once ideological differences, 
discussions, and groups were no longer possible inside the Soviet Communist 
Party, the mass purge of hundreds of thousands of Communist Party members 
and millions of so-called kulaks was entirely unnecessary. 
Thus had the mass purge "outlived its historical usefulness." It had even 
begun to engulf Stalin's closest collaborators and to threaten the very physical 
existence of the Communist Party. 
Under conditions in which narrow cliques or power-mad individuals replaced 
Ideological groups, the rulers of the Bolshevik Party found it necessary to have a 
different sort of purge?the purge of picked and strategically placed followers of 
a particularly ambitious individual leader whom Stalin or his immediate en-
tourage feared. This is the difference between the Khrushchev purge of Beria 
and his henchmen and Stalin's mass purges of numerous ideological supporters of 
Trotsky, Zinoviev, and Bukharin in the Bolshevik ranks. 
Between Bukharin and Stalin and between Trotsky and Stalin there were very 
Important political and ideogolical differences. But between Khrushchev and 
Malenkov or Molotov and between Khrushchev and Beria there were no serious 
ideological differences. Theirs was primarily a clash over the amassing of 
power?actually a stage in the conflict over who is to succeed Stalin as the 
omnipotent and omniscient party dictator. 
This is the inevitable logic of internal organization development in all totali-
tarian parties. This is especially true for a Communist Party which directs an 
ironclad dictatorship over the people in every walk of life and human endeavor. 
In this connection, it is necessary to note that, under the very cover of paying 
continuous and loud lipservice to the principle of collective party leadership, 
Stalin grabbed total power for himself. While proclaiming loyalty to this "prin-
ciple," Stalin eliminated physically every potential political opponent of his, 
everyone who might conceivably be able to have an idea of his own or demonstrate 
sufficient courage to work and fight for his convictions. 
Today Khrushchev is following faithfully this Stalin pattern of elimination of 
leaders and gradual concentration of power in his own hands. Here we have the 
key to the political demotion and humiliation of Malenkov and Molotov and the 
most recent "retirement" of Kaganovich from active life in the Soviet Party and 
Government. Here we have the why and wherefore of Khrushchev's ordering 
the execution of Beria and his closest colleagues. 
While this transformation of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was 
going on, the other Communist parties were also being changed in their composi-
tion and character, in their anatomy and physiology, In their structure and func-
tioning. They also became parties of blind and mechanical followers. They also 
hardly attracted any critical-minded individuals. 
They became primarily paramilitary outfits organized to execute Kremlin 
commands and to make shifts of Communist Party line quickly and with least 
loss of members, regardless of how sharp the turn was.

SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES 1609 
Only Communist Parties thus molded could weather as they did the shift 
brought into painful relief by the Stalin-Hitler pact and the present anti-Stalin 
campaign. Only organizations hammered into such shape and malleability could 
hail the Stalin-Hitler pact which led to World War II as a great service to 
world peace. This explains why and how the Communist Parties throughout 
the world?which had for years boasted about their militant antifascism?could 
commend Nazi Germany as a force for peace and condemn the allied democracies 
as warmongers and aggressors. 
In the same spirit and for the same reason, the Communists in the United 
States and other democracies tried to sabotage armament production. They 
sought to help the Berlin-Rome-Tokyo Axis with which their Soviet "paradise" 
was then pact-bound. This is what the Communists did?until Hitler forced 
Stalin to change his line by attacking him. 
This process of political automation which has been going on for years inside 
the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was mechanically and rigidly carried 
over by Stalin into all other Communist Parties. The Communist Party of 
every country was transformed completely into a puppet outfit slavishly and 
mechanically supporting all Soviet foreign and domestic policies. 
Thus were the internal cliques, intrigues, and conflicts afflicting the Soviet 
Communist Party mechanically transplanted into and automatically reflected 
inside every other Communist Party. Every non-Russian party leadership was 
soon turned into a rubberstamp of the dominant ruler of the Communist Party 
outside the Soviet Union, of the international Communist movement as a whole. 
When Stalin decided during World War II to liquidate the Comintern, the 
very ones who were its top functionaries and-titular leaders did not know about 
the Kremlin ukase ordering the end of their organization. They learned about 
the "demise" only after they had read its "death" notice in Pravda. 
In view of this total political automation, it was not so difficult for the very 
ones whom Stalin had put into the "leadership" of the various Communist parties 
to denounce him as a murderer, sex pervert, and arsonist?once the clique con-
trolling the Soviet Communist Party turned on Stalin. The "leaderships" of 
the other Communist parties almost automatically and with very few exceptions 
followed the same course of denouncing Stalin, whom they had for many years 
sycophantically hailed as a supergod. 
This fantastic turnabout and repudiation of themselves was not very difficult 
for those with years of experience in echoing, aping, and supporting the policies 
and maneuvers of whoever happened to rule the Communist Party of the Soviet 
Union at any moment. 
It is very instructive to note that all the Communist parties outside of the 
Soviet Union not only fell in line with the denunciations of Stalin as a demon. 
They fell in line with equal precision in supporting the entire international 
strategical and tactical line laid down for world communism by the 20th Congress 
(co-existence, united and popular fronts, different roads to "socialism," etc.). 
This habit of automatic reflection of Soviet Communist Party life and regimen 
has become a cardinal characteristic, sort of second nature, for Communist or-
ganizations throughout the world. 
It is this inherent feature of Communist (Leninist-Stalinist) organizational 
structure and functioning that accounts for the speed, skill, and shamelessness 
with which the Communist parties outside the U. S. S. H.?the puppets and 
dependents of the present Kremlin regime?are now carrying out the instructions 
from Moscow to proclaim their "Independence" from Moscow. 
The very manner, the very timing, the whole International sequence and chorus 
of this proclamation of "Independence" only demonstrate anew the brazennes 
and cynicism of the real rulers of world communism. The very occasion for and 
manner of these Communist parties proclaiming their "independence from 
Moscow" provide crushing confirmation of how hopelessly dependent these or-
ganizations are on whatever clique happens to be dominant in the Communist 
Party of the Soviet Union. 
Obviously, their dependence has taken on a sort of "new look." However 
different the countenance of this dependence may appear, its contents are essen-
tially unchanged. 
The "declaration of independence" is not so new. After all, once the 
Comintern was declared dissolved, every Communist Party was "on its own" 
and, therefore, "independent." The relations between every Communist party 
and Moscow?under such circumstances?could be only bilateral. This is ex-
actly the relationship that the latest Communist Party of the United States 
declaration proposes to have with the Soviet Communist Party and other Cora-

munist parties. Other Communist parties have already followed with the same 
proposal. 
Here we must note that several Comintern officers, who have since broken with 
Moscow, have disclosed that, in spite of the formal dissolution of the Comin-
tern, an international Communist organization did continue to function under 
the direction of the Kremlin. So history will repeat itself after the more re-
cent dissolution of the Oominform, which covered only a limited area. 
Contradictory? Confusing? Weird? Well, let Lenin himself explain this 
"mystery," this flexibility and duplicity of Communist tactics, this readiness on 
the part of Communists to turn somersault, to lie, to resort to all sorts of frauds, 
to wallow in the mud in order to build their most cherished instrument?the party 
which is their engine of subversion and destruction of democracy. 
Said Lenin: 
"It is necessary to be able to * * * agree to any and every sacrifice, and even?
if need be?to resort to all sorts of stratagems, maneuvers and illegal methods 
to evasion and subterfuge in order to penetrate the trade unions, to remain in 
them and to carry on Communist work in them at all costs. * * * Of course, in 
Western Europe, which is particularly saturated with inveterate legalist, consti-
tutionalist, bourgeois-democratic prejudices, it is more difficult to carry on such 
work. But it can and must be carried on, and carried on systematically." (Left 
Wing Communism, an Infantile Disorder, pp. 95-96.) 
Soviet imperialist interests and the interests of the present dominant clique 
in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union demand that the peoples of the 
Soviet Empire should believe that there is something really new and better about 
the post-Stalin regime. These interests demand that the outside world, the non-
Soviet world, particularly the Western democracies and the labor movements 
of the free world, should believe that the Soviet "new look" is something genu-
inely different, something truly new and better. 
Why is this so? Stalin's domestic and foreign policies had already exhausted 
their usefulness even before the 19th Soviet Communist Party Congress, held 
in October 1952. Stalin himself had begun to recognize that his political and 
his organization technique had run their course both at home and abroad. Such 
recognition by Stalin was reflected in the decisions of the 19th Party Congress. 
The roots of the present Khrushchev strategy and tactics and the basis of 
the current Soviet domestic and foreign policies are to be found in the line laid 
down by Stalin himself at and for the 19th Soviet Communist Party Congress. 
What is really new in the U. S. S. R. since this congress is that the Khrushchev 
leadership?which was created by Stalin?is now trying to avoid all blame and 
condemnation by the Soviet peoples and the outside world for the disastrous 
moral, political, and economic consequences of Stalinism. 
The Khrushchev leadership continues to be loyal to the fundamental political 
and organization principles of Leninism-Stalinism--that is, to totalitarian com-
munism and its goal of world domination. But the Krushchev leadership is 
realistic enough to know that it must rely on new methods and different tactics 
in order to revitalize and improve the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, 
which is its engine of total power over the economic, military, political, and 
cultural life of the Soviet Empire. 
No one should seek to deny or even belittle the significance of the changes 
which they are making inside the U. S. S. R. and throughout the international 
Communist movement. But these changes are being made by Khrushchev and 
his clique solely to strengthen their grip on the Soviet Communist Party, to 
bolster the position of the Soviet Union in the current critical international 
situation. 
These changes aim to modernize and streamline the machinery of the world 
Communist movement so as to enable it to carry out all the more effectively the 
new line of the 20th Communist Congress?the line of greater infiltration and 
penetration, more extensive subversion and the conquest of the free trade unions, 
social democratic parties, and other labor organizations in the free world. 
Significant as these changes are, they do not prove that Khrushchev and his 
collected leadership are moving toward liberalism and taking steps which will 
lead even slowly yet surely to the replacement of aggressive Communist total-
itarian dictatorship with a democratic system of government dedicated to living 
In peace with all other nations. 
Khrushchev and his aids realize that the new times call for a new approach. 
They realize that the new tasks demand that Communist parties drop their old 
methods of work, break with their former practically open avowal of loyal sub-

servience to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and to the Soviet Gov-
ernment which it controls. Here we have one of the principal reasons for the 
maneuver of pretended and pretentious "independence from Moscow" now being 
made by all Communist parties. 
But it would be a mistake to consider this formal and noisy disavowal of 
dependence on and subservience to Moscow as only a maneuver?as merely formal 
compliance with orders from Moscow. It is all that, but it is also much more. 
Even more important than the Moscow-dictated maneuver itself is the reason 
for the Kremlin making it at this time. In this instance, the why of the action 
is even more important than the significant action itself. 
The Khrushchev leadership is compelled to make this sweeping maneuver in 
the ranks of world communism for basically the same reason which impelled 
it to resort to the denigration of Stalin. The Kremlin ruling clique is trying 
to preserve the essence and substance of Stalinism within the U. S. S. R. and 
throughout world communism, while seeking to blur or disown its crudest and 
most obviously repulsive features. 
Decades of bestiality, political depravity, moral degradation and human 
enslavement have revealed the hideous nature of Soviet and world communism, 
its degrading organization and its reprehensible methods of functioning. These 
dark decades have produced a soil fertile for the seeds of disintegration of inter-
national communism as an ideology, as a universal philosophy, as a Weltan-
scl" ming. 
Khrushchev and his aids are fully aware of this. They are trying to check 
this trend toward the disintegration of communism as an ideology of enchant-
ment or an avenue of escape by making certain superficial and surface changes 
in their methods of rule and leadership, in their strategy and tactics, in their 
control of the Communist parties outside the U. S. S. R. They are doing this 
In order to preserve and promote the overriding aim of communism which, under 
Khrushchev no less than under Lenin or Stalin, remains the conquest of the 
world and its transformation along the lines of the Soviet pattern. 
We cannot warn too strongly against confusing the moral and political cor-
rosion of communism as an ideology with the corrosion of the Communist dic-
tatorship as a political power system. The two are related. But they are not 
identical. There are elements of serious disintegration in communism as an 
ideology. But, at this moment, there are no important signs of disintegration 
of communism as a political power system within the Soviet Union or in any of 
its satellites. 
The ruthlessness and dispatch with which the Warsaw puppet regime recently 
crushed the revolt of the Poznan workers for bread and freedom show that Mos-
cow continues to control the machinery of the world Communist conspiracy. 
Moscow continues to inspire, direct, and finance this worldwide subversive con-
spiracy and fifth-column apparatus. 
But in this control Moscow is bound to face new and serious complications 
and difficulties. We must never forget that, though all Communists and Com-
munist parties continue to owe their first loyalty to the Soviet dictatorship, they 
are, especially in the Western democracies, also subjected to the influence of other 
forces. 
The effects of Communist ideological disintegration cannot be helpful to the 
Communist political power system. However, the Communist power system can 
be used effectively to counteract the manifestations of ideological disintegration. 
Khrushchev is now using very effectively his giant political power system for 
this purpose. In this the top boss of Soviet and world communism has been great-
ly helped by two factors: (1) the failure of the free world to exploit the moral 
and political bankruptcy of communism as an ideology, and (2) the readiness of 
too many in the free world to swallow the Soviet "new look," hook, line and sinker. 
The move to have each Communist party publicly proclaim its "independence" 
from Moscow is calculated to eradicate, or at least to halt, the trend toward 
the disintegration of communism as an ideology. It is easier for a robotized 
Communist outfit which proclaims its being "free from Russian control" to serve 
the interests of Soviet foreign policy and enhance the prestige of the Kremlin 
rulers than for an outfit that can be easily labeled "made in Moscow." 
To prove their "independence," all Communist parties will, henceforth, be 
permitted, upon specific instructions from their masters in Moscow, to "differ" 
from and "criticize" certain particular Soviet actions. This move seeks also to 
allay the discontent and the dismay which undoubtedly existed in the various 
Communist parties, especially after the Khrushchev revelations about Stalin.

However, as long as their parties are Leninist, Communist, they will never 
disavow the basic aims of communism. They will never oppose or even question 
the fundamental interests and basic line of the totalitarian Soviet Government. 
They will never dilute their essential primacy of loyalty to the Soviet ruling 
party and its dominant clique. 
Moscow is taking a calculated risk in this audacious maneuver. Some "com-
rades" in the free world will fall by the wayside. The recruiting of new members 
will certainly be slowed down in this area. For a while? recruitment may even 
be brought to a grinding halt. But since the Communist Party is essentially 
a paramilitary cadre organization, it can afford such a halt for a period of 
time. 
Through this new "Independence from Moscow" line, the Kremlin aims to facil-
itate the Communist development of united and popular front strategy and tac-
tics. Through these tactics Moscow's Communists hope to gain new and fresh 
recruits from Socialist, labor, and liberal ranks. 
Moscow is sure that the winning of such recruits and the success of the popular 
front policy will soon again bring Communists into the cabinets of western 
governments. Moscow is confident that the "independent" Communist parties 
will find it easier at least to lead these governments toward much less suspicion 
or even to far greater faith in the Khrushchev regime. 
The naive attitude of French Foreign Minister Pineau toward the Khrushchev 
regime now at the helm of Soviet imperialism, the loose talk in Washington and 
London about Moscow's readiness to remove the sources and causes of world 
tension, the deliberate weakening of NATO and their own military forces by 
some western powers all confirm the marked success which the Kremlin has 
already had in hoodwinking western statesmanship. The latter has, unfortu-
nately, shown a terrific capacity for wishful thinking. 
To permit the various foreign appendages of the Communist Party of the 
Soviet Union to tak about or, in a limited sense, even to act their "independence" 
from Moscow is a very small price for the Kremlin to pay?if, in return, it should 
be able to plant its fifth columnists and dupes in important posts in western 
democratic and neutralist governments. 
Indeed, this is a very small price to pay for making it easier for the Com-
munist parties and their followers to soften and undermine the will and the 
determination of the free world to reject and resist the basic aims of Soviet 
communism?the fundamental, aggressive, totalitarian aims which have not 
been dropped or even modified in the least. 
In this light, it is not hard to understand the sudden "moral" awakening of 
Nenni?leader of the pro-Soviet Italian Socialist Party?about political degrada-
tion in the Soviet Union. In this light, it is easy to understand Nenni's dissatis-
faction with the way the Kremlin has of late been mauling Stalin, who had been 
his guide, guardian, and benefactor for years. But the world has still to hear 
a single word from Nenni as to when he will break his pact of common action 
with Khrushchev's agency in Italy?the Communist Party headed by Togliatti. 
We have yet to hear from Nenni, from Foster (titular head of the Communist 
Party in the United States), from Togliatti, from the French Communist boss 
Thorez and from the Chinese Mao Tse-tung a demand that the Kremlin should 
correct and atone for the crimes it perpetrated under Stalin's guidance against 
the captive peoples of Europe and Asia. 
We have yet to hear from these servants of the Kremlin a single word of re-
pudiation and condemnation of the germ warfare charges leveled by the Moscow-
Peiping Axis against the United States. 
Of course, if and when Khrushchev should press a button and give the Com-
munist Party automatons in the United States the order to do so, his fifth column 
in our country will surely respond. Only then will the Daily Worker have enough 
"independence" to denounce as a Stalinist fraud the Moscow-Peiping germ war-
fare charges against our country. 
As long as this world Communist regime and relationships continue, all talk 
about the Communist Party in the United States or any other Communist Party 
being independent from Moscow is just plain nonsense. As long as these parties 
remain Communist in aim and character, they will continue to function as de-
pendents, as auxiliaries, as agencies of their parent body, the Communist Party 
of "Holy Mother Russia." 
Only when such organizations or individuals disown and break with the princi-
ples and practices of totalitarian communism, only when they are no longer

SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES 1613 
Communists, only when they fight actively against the pernicious Communist evil 
can they stop being instruments of Moscow in intent or content, in aim or 
action. 
It might be said that the Tito experience proves that there can be going Com-
munist concerns which are independent of Moscow. It is rather significant that, 
today, Moscow is especially interested in promoting this illusion. Why? Because 
Tito has a very important role to perform for Moscow In advancing the Soviet's 
new line of penetration and subversion of the Social Democrats, neutralists, and 
even some bona fide free trade-union organizations. 
Let us look into this Tito myth a bit farther. It took nearly a billion dollars 
worth of American military aid?plus untold other western aid, comfort, and 
confidence?to keep the Tito Communist regime alive. Tito's Communist dic-
tatorship could never have survived without this unstinting "capitalist" generos-
ity. Moreover, as soon as Moscow began to change its tactics?not its principles 
and aims?Tito began a sweeping rapprochement with the Soviet Government in 
the arena of international diplomacy and also with the Communist Party and the 
Soviet political police apparatus. 
Obviously, Yugoslavia cannot dominate or direct the Soviet Union's foreign 
or domestic course. Khrushchev may have formally apologized to Tito for 
"Stalin's crimes :" but, in return, Tito has actually and actively alined himself 
with the Khrushchev regime in support of all its important foreign policies and 
in hailing the Soviet "new look." 
These foreign policies aim to preserve the loot seized?under Stalin's leader-
ship?for Soviet imperialism. These Soviet foreign policies seek to promote 
the drive for Communist world domination. The hub of a Communist world 
empire would be Moscow, not Belgrade. Its hero, or its fuehrer, would be a 
Khrushchev, not a Tito. 
In view of all these changes and bewildering maneuvers by the Soviet rulers 
of world communism, it is very important to keep in mind that neither Lenin, 
nor Stalin, nor Khrushchev is individually or collectively solely to blame for 
the inhuman savagery, the moral degradation, and the physical and intellectual 
enslavement suffered by countless millions behind the Iron Curtain. 
Of course, no one should seek to absolve these criminals and paranoids of any 
guilt for their bestial crimes. But as criminals they are the products, the most 
powerful specimens and most noxious weeds, of communism as a totalitarian 
system and ideology. Stalin and the present Khrushchev leadership which he 
created and trained are certainly criminal desperadoes. But the Communist 
system which breeds and rears such criminal types as the rulers and leaders of 
its society is even more horribly criminal. 
Lenins and Stalins may come and go. Khrushchevs may rise and fall. But 
as long as the Communist system continues, new and perhaps more dangerous 
and even more depraved criminals are bound to take their place in perpetrating 
the blackest crimes against the Soviet peoples and all humanity. 
Those in the United States or anywhere else who continue to have faith in 
dictatorship, in totalitarianism, in the Soviet Union as an historically progres-
sive and humanely beneficial system, in the fundamental aims of communism, can 
never be truly independent of Moscow?either as individuals or as organized 
bodies and parties. 
As long as these people or parties remain loyal to the basic aims of Soviet 
communism or continue to place their faith in the principles of totalitarian 
communism, they cannot be anything else but apostles, agents, and agencies of 
totalitarian dictatorship?instruments of deceit, brutality, and aggression. 
No matter how loudly or how often such individuals or organizations may 
shout about their "independence from Moscow," they will remain prisoners of a 
horrible power and a morally degrading faith whose seat and center, whose head 
and heart are in Moscow.
