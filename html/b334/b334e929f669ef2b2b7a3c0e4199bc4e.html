China: Can Lar e Arms Sales 
Be Sustained? 
(b)(3) 
China is unlikely to maintain its position as the world's sixth-largest arms 
supplier if the Iran-Iraq war ends. Since embarking on a full-scale arms ex-
port campaign in the early 1980s, Beijing has averaged almost $1.5 billion 
in arms sales each year, with Baghdad and Tehran accounting for 75 
percent of sales. We believe this war-driven market is unlikely to last: both 
countries are interested in reequipping their armed forces with better 
Western or Soviet Bloc equipment. We also believe that China is unlikely 
to find other customers in the short to medium term to make up for the ex-
pected postwar decline in sales to Iran and Iraq. Most large or relatively 
professional Third World militaries will remain uninterested in Chinese 
weapons, which are considered technologically inferior to Soviet or West-
ern equivalents. 
Beijing almost certainly recognizes the transient nature of the Iran-Iraq 
market and is trying to attract new customers to China's easily operated 
and serviced weapons. China is offering economic incentives�such as 
financing and coproduction�increasingly demanded by buyers, but it  
generally has not been able to compete against wealthier suppliers.  
(b)(3) 
In view of the contraction in the global arms market in recent years 
because of growing arms inventories, mounting LDC debt, and declining 
oil revenues, we believe China's hard currency earnings from arms exports 
will decline over the short term. This decline may constrain China's ability 
to purchase US or Western arms or production technology and slow the 
pace of the military modernization of Chinese forces along the Sino-Soviet 
border. Short-term pressures on China might be reduced if nations 
dependent on the USSR for arms turn to China for spare parts or 
replacement weapons.

China: Can Large Arms Sales 
Be Sustained? 
Introduction 
Between 1980 and 1982, China emerged as the 
world's sixth-largest arms supplier (after the USSR, 
the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and 
West Germany), largely on the strength of sales to  
Iran and Iraq.  
his paper analyzes the source of the strengths 
and weaknesses in China's sales of arms to the Third 
World and evaluates China's potential to compete in 
the tight international arms market in the aftermath 
of the Iran-Iraq war. It also assesses China's longer 
term prospects as an arms exporter 
(b)(3) 
1980s Arms Sales: A Booming Record 
(b)(1) China's emergence as a major arms seller in the 1980s 
(b)(3) stems from a decision made in 1979 to enter the 
international arms market to earn hard currency. This 
decision�taken as a part of Deng Xiaoping's modern-
ization drive 
signaled Beijing's move away from political factors as 
the primary motive for Chinese arms exports. Until 
then, China's arms sales and grant military aid had 
(b)(1) focused on strengthening strategic neighbors like Pa-
(b)(3) kistan and North Korea. 
arms sales would generate sufficient hard currency to 
help modernize the armed forces with Western arms 
and technology. Beijing sought to take advantage of 
the increase in Middle Eastern arms purchases that 
accompanied rising oil prices, but most of the oil-rich 
countries initially rejected China's weapons in favor 
of more sophisticated Western or Soviet arms.

Figure i. More than 2,000 tanks have been sold to Iraq 
China's opening into the lucrative Middle Eastern 
market came in 1980, immediately following the 
outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war, as a result of Soviet 
refusal to sell major military equipment to Iraq. 
Chinese equipment helped Iraq withstand repeated  
Iranian ground offensives   
 Iraq received more than 
70 percent of China's estimated worldwide arms 
exports in 1981 and 1982 
during this period Iraq contracted for more than 
2,000 Chinese tanks, enough to replace most of its 
losses (figure 2). Chinese deliveries of more than 1,000 
armored personnel carriers (APCs) were sufficient to 
replace an estimated two-thirds of Iraq's APC losses. 
Baghdad also received large quantities of field artil-
lery, air defense artillery, and ammunition. 
position as Baghdad's major arms source, and China 
signed no large new deals with Iraq. Tehran, for its 
part, purchased large quantities of Chinese ammuni-
tion and artillery through North Korean and other 
intermediaries, replacing Iraq as China's largest cus-
tomer. We believe Tehran accepted Chinese offers 
because Iran desperately needed consumables, such as  
small arms and ammunition, to continue the war  
During the 1983-85 period, Iran gradually replaced 
Iraq as Beijing's primary customer. During that time, 
the USSR and Eastern Europe resumed their prewar 
Arms sales to countries other than Iran and Iraq fell 
during this period and have continued to decline, 
despite Beijing's attempts to attract new customers. 
During the last two years, China was able to make 
more sales to Iraq and Iran as Baghdad resumed 
purchases of Chinese equipment and materiel, and 
Tehran added to its purchases by buying major

ace-to-air missile of the type sold to 
Chinese equipment for the first time. We estimate 
Iraq signed contracts worth more than $1 billion in 
1986. China's large sales to Iran apparently resulted 
from Beijing's decision to deal with Iran 
directly. These orders from Iraq and Iran came as 
new Chinese contracts with other customers dwindled 
to almost insignificant levels. 
Chinese weapons and ammunition helped Iran and 
Iraq continue the war, and recent deliveries have  
enhanced Iranian capabilities.  
Since late 1985 we have confirmed at least $1 billion 
in sales to Iran: a deal in 1985 for HQ-2 
surface-to-air missiles, antiship missiles, field artil-
lery, and ammunition; and up to in sales 
in 1986 for various weapons systems and ammunition

(figure 3). The limited quantities of HQ-2s deliverea(1)(3) 
to Iran will not seriously impede Iraqi air attacks on 
vital oil terminals and refineries, in our judgment, 
Limitations Through the Early 1990s 
In the near term, China is likely to face serious 
limitations in its effort to sell more arms in the Third 
World. China's large sales volume so far in the 1980s 
has resulted primarily from Iraq's, and more recently 
Iran's, need for inexpensive, easy-to-use weapons. 
Without large Iranian and Iraqi purchases, we believe 
Chinese arms sales will be significantly reduced until 
at least 1990 by a limited customer base, inferior 
technology, and marketing weaknesses

Limited Customer Base 
- The lack of a reliable and extensive customer base will 
make it difficult for China to maintain its current 
level of sales. The number of nations buying arms 
from China has declined over the last four years�
some customers in the early 1980s proved to be one-
time buyers, and several first-time customers in the 
� last three years are unlikely to make additional  
purchases. 
In our view, Iraq is unlikely to continue buying such 
large amounts of Chinese arms even if the war drags 
on. We believe Baghdad only turned back to Beijing 
in 1986, after three years of minimal purchases, 
because reduced income from falling oil prices had 
made the inexpensive Chinese weapons more attrac-
tive. The even larger purchases of weapons and 
munitions from the USSR, however, indicate Bagh-
dad's continuing preference for Soviet equipment. 
When the war ends, Iraq is likely to resume its late 
1970s' effort to improve its armed forces with up-to-
date Western and Soviet Bloc equipment. 
Iran is more likely to continue its large purchases 
from China, and Beijing 
is trying to arrange more sales�possibly including 
tanks, fighter aircraft, and air-to-air missiles. We 
believe Iran's purchases are not likely to equal the 
scale of Iraq's past purchases, however, either during 
or after the war: 
f Tehran's war strategy is based on infantry-artillery 
offensives that do not require large quantities of 
equipment other than artillery, munitions, and small 
arms. 
� After the war, we believe that the Iranian military 
will seek higher technology non-Communist equip-
ment and that a number of suppliers will be avail-
able. 
3e.ere�. 
Inferior Technology 
China's arms sales to large or relatively professional 
Third World militaries will be limited by the wide-
spread and largely correct perception that Chinese 
weapons are technologically less sophisticated than 
Western and Soviet exports: 
� Most Chinese weapons are based on Soviet designs 
and technology of the 1950s. 
One consequence of the dated technology in Chinese 
weapons is the low demand for Chinese training and 
maintenance support, which will further weaken Bei-
jing's market position. Other large suppliers use Third 
World military training in the supplier country to 
keep customers dependent on the supplier for spare  
parts and follow-on support after an initial sale.

 China does not hesitate 
to offer training on its more sophisticated systems, 
however; more than 100 Iranians trained in China on 
antiship missiles in 1985 
Marketing Weaknesses 
China's limited financial resources and emphasis on 
earning hard currency through cash sales place it at a 
significant disadvantage in an increasingly competi-
tive Third World arms market.  
Beijing has been slow to adopt creative 
financing practices, provides very little military aid, 
and shows few signs of being abl 
tively with other major suppliers. 
Many Third World nations are seeking licensed pro-
duction agreements to reduce the foreign exchange 
cost of arms purchases and to gradually decrease their 
dependence on foreign weapons suppliers. Most major 
suppliers,including the USSR, are responding to this 
demand to garner sales and protect their markets; but 
China is largely absent from the coproduction picture. 
Even if China were to offer licensed 
production to other customers, it would be refused, in 
our view, because few countries can benefit from 
purchases of dated Chinese production technology. 
China's marketing efforts remain amateurish when 
compared with those of more established suppliers, 
which will hurt Beijing's sales in the highly competi-
tive marketplace 
China is taking steps to attract new customers by 
improving its marketing, but it is still not ready for 
the showy marketing arena of the large Western 
suppliers: 
� Beijing hosted its first international arms exhibition 
in November 1986, which featured China's newest 
equipment along with personnel to  discuss the capa-
bilities of the equipment and sales. 
China's direct sales pitches to governments are also 
flawed

Abis� 
Prospects for the 1990s 
We believe China recognizes the need to develop a 
market for its weapons beyond Iran and Iraq, and the 
steps it is taking now to attract new customers may 
enable it to maintain a moderate level of sales in the 
1990s. China, for example, is developing new equip-
ment�much of it specifically designed to meet cus-
tomer requirements�and is seeking to incorporate 
Western technology into its weapons. China enjoys 
several comparative advantages that may further 
bolster arms sales in the 1990s, if the technology lag 
can be bridged. The key to China's future success, in 
our judgment, is its ability to market its improved 
products in an increasingly competitive marketplace. 
If China is unsuccessful in its attempts to produce and 
sell major weapons based on Western technology, the 
prospects for increased arms sales are not as optimis-
tic. 
Overcoming Technological Inferiority 
China is seeking several ways to overcome the most 
important drawback to increasing arms sales�the 
technological inferiority of its weapons. We believe 
Beijing is producing NATO-standard weapons and 
ammunition and is reconfiguring current weapons to 
meet customer requests.

Low-Cost, Easy-To-Use Weapons 
China probably will continue to maintain a moderate 
level of arms sales based on its traditional strengths. 
Relatively unsophisticated, small military forces in 
the Third World find Chinese weapons attractive 
because of their simplicity and low price. As with 
Soviet, weapons, training is not complicated, and 
personnel with limited basic or technical education 
can learn to operate Chinese weapons easily and 
quickly. 
We believe China's potential market will continue to 
include all LDCs that have purchased weapons from 
the USSR or its allies. Most of China's weapons and 
ammunition types are identical to, or derived from, 
Soviet models, and most of its sales have been made to 
LDCs that have  
purchased Soviet weapons  
many Third World countries still want 
to diversify their source of arms. Some nations may 
purchase arms from Beijing to make Moscow more 
forthcoming with equipment or financing. In cases 
where Moscow and a client government have a falling 
out, Beijing may have opportunities for more signifi-
cant sales. 
(b)(3) 
Beijing has also made a place for itself by providing 
spare parts and technical assistance for Soviet equip-
ment. China produces parts for its own inventory of 
weapons based on Soviet designs and can provide 
parts for a wide variety of older Soviet equipmentl--1

Market Variables 
If China is to maintain or expand its current sales 
volume, it must overcome several factors that will 
constrain the arms sales of all suppliers to the Third 
World over the long term. All of these factors, taken 
together, have already led to a contraction in the 
Third World arms market of at least 20 percent since 
1982, and a repetition of the boom years for the 
international arms trade in the late 1970s and early 
1980s it unlikely: 
� Many Third World nations purchased their first 
major weapons systems�jet combat aircraft, war-
ships, and armored vehicles�in the last decade, and 
dther, larger LDC militaries completed major ex-
pansions and modernizations of their inventories at 
the same time. We judge that many LDCs will 
make no major weapons purchases until at least the 
early�1990s, when another more modest moderniza-
� tion cycle will begin to replace arms purchased in 
the 1970s. 
� Falling oil prices since 1982 have also reduced sales 
� to the Middle East as well as to other oil-producing 
states. Only a significant rise in oil prices would 
rekindle strong demand in the I 990s. � 
� Falling commodity prices in general have reduced 
export earnings for many nonoil producing, less 
developed countries, thereby reducing their ability 
to buy arms. 
� Rising LDC foreign debt burdens, in part a result of 
falling commodity prices and previously ambitious 
import schemes, have forced sharp cutbacks in LDC 
imports of many goods, including arms. Many 
LDCs are likely to face debt-imposed import limita-
tions well into the 1990s. 
� Many Third World nations are slowly developing 
indigenous defense industries. This trend is likely to 
continue as LDCs try to reduce their dependence on 
foreign arms suppliers and the foreign exchange cost 
of importing arms. Indigenous Third World produc-
tion wiff reduce the export market and provide more 
competition for China in its areas of strength�
inexpensive, relatively unsophisticated weapons and 
ammunition. 
� The equipment China is developing today for export 
will face stiff competition from other Third World 
suppliers. Brazil produces the highly successful 
Tucano trainer aircraft, armored vehicles, and a 
wide range of other equipment that competes direct-
ly with Chinese armament. Other emerging suppli-
ers, such as Singapore  and South Africa, will also be 
anxious to make sales. 
We believe China's effort to develop both higher 
quality and more widely demanded weapons while 
maintaining low prices gives it a better-than-even 
chance of selling at least $1 billion of arms annually 
irt the 1990s. Beijing's potential ability to supply 
inexpensive weapons with few political strings at-
tached will give it an advantage over large arms 
suppliers marketing costly high-technology items. In 
addition, Beijing's ability to produce large quantities 
of arms quickly will give China an edge over smaller 
nations that can only produce in small quantities. 
Only China's inability to or lack of interest in offering 
attractive financing or licensed production packages 
will remain serious constraints to its 1990s' market 
position.
