 LEBANON:  Situation Report
 I     I The failure of yesterday's tripartite Lebanese talks
 s arp y reduces the prospects that the Syrians and Palestinians
 will be able to reach any kind of accommodation without further
 fighting. President-elect Sarkis, Palestine Liberation organiza-
 tion chief Yasir Arafat, and Syrian Deputy Defense Minister
 Jamil have announced that they will meet again on Friday after
 Sarkis' inauguration ceremony but this announcement was proba-
 bly intended only to mask the fact that their talks had ended
 in a deadlock.
 I    I Arab League mediator al-Khuli admitted privately be-
 tore the session yesterday that he had tried in vain to per-
 suade Arafat to agree to an unconditional withdrawal of Pales-
 tinian forces from the Mount Lebanon area. Both Sarkis, repre-
 senting the Christian side,  and the Syrians reportedly had in-
 sisted on that provision being included in any new cease-fire
 accord.
 Al-Khuli indicated that he did not believe Arafat
 possesse   the strength to impose such a compromise on his own
 forces because of opposition from extremist members of the Re-
 jection Front and from Fatah hard-liners lead by Salah Khalaf.
 Each side apparently only rehashed its standard posi-
 tion at yesterday's meeting. Baghdad radio reported that Arafat
 offered to withdraw from the mountains but only if the Syrians
 and Christians would make comparable withdrawals and agree to
 allow displaced persons to return to their own areas,  particu-
 larly to the Tall Zatar refugee camp overrun by the Christians
 last month. Neither the Syrians nor the Christians could be ex-
 pected to agree to such a,condition.
 Yet another meeting to resolve the Lebanese conflict
 ILLY JDe- U  er consideration, this time in Saudi Arabia. An-Nahar,
 a reputable and usually well-informed Lebanese newspaper, re-
 ported yesterday that Sarkis and several other prominent Leba-
 nese leaders who visited Cairo recently are pressing for a
 Approved For Pelease 2007/03/06 : CIA-RDP79T00975A0293P00010032-1
 Approved For R4
 four-power Arab summit conference in Jidda to promote a recon-
 ciliation between Egypt and Syria that would facilitate efforts
 to end the Lebanese civil war.
 I     I Presidents Sadat and Asad are said to be agreeable to
 such an approach, under the auspices of the Saudi and Kuwaiti
 monarchs, who have been trying for months to patch up relations
 between Egypt and Syria. An-Nahar said that no date had been
 set yet, but that Sadat had indicated he was willing to attend
 such a meeting on Friday or Saturday, immediately after Id al-
 Fitr, the Muslim holiday celebrating the breaking of the month
 of fasting, Ramadan.
 I           ISarkis is also reported to have asked Sadat--allegedly
 with Syrian approval--to contribute troops to the Arab League
 peace-keeping force now in Lebanon.
 Should the proposed summit talks go well, Sarkis and
 Ara fa  might be asked to join them, according to An-Nahar. Al-
 though Asad and Sadat may have agreed to meet, we are highly
 skeptical that they are ready to put aside their differences in
 order to resolve the Lebanese conflict.
 The article may reflect the wishful thinking of some
 Lebanese leaders, perhaps encouraged by the Egyptians. Sadat
 could well be receptive to such an idea because it would place
 him on a par with Asad as a final arbitrator in any Lebanese
 political settlement--a status that until now has eluded him.
 I                    IThe USSR is at least trying to create the impression
 that it is involved actively behind the scenes during the talks
 among Lebanese, Palestinian, and Syrian officials. PLO political
 chief Qaddumi left Moscow on Saturday, following several days
 of talks with Soviet officials, including Foreign Minister
 Gromyko.
 Soviet press commentary over the weekend suggests
 that Soviet spokesmen are urging the Palestinians to compromise
 in order to reach a negotiated settlement in Lebanon. Tass, in

 describing the talks, said that all progressive Arab forces
 must cooperate to end the crisis, which indicates that Palestin-
 ians as well as Syrians should be forthcoming at the talks.
 I             Pravda has emphasized the importance of a political
 solution and made no mention of the need for a Syrian troop
 withdrawal, a major obstacle to any settlement. Soviet press
 commentary has recently been stressing the importance of a Syr-
 ian withdrawal, and Soviet officials have also been taking the
 same line in private. Moscow may have decided to importune the
 Palestinians at this juncture.
 I             The USSR is also in touch with Syria. The Soviet rep-
 resentative at the Geneva conference on the Middle East, Vladi-
 mir Vinogradov, arrived in Syria on Friday and consulted with
 Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Khaddam the following
 day. Vinogradov customarily travels to the Middle East during
 periods of Arab negotiations so that Moscow can be informed of
 Arab policies. He performed this function during the disengage-
 ment talks in 1974 and 1975.

 CHINA: Leadership Appearance
 All active members of the Politburo, including those
 based in the provinces, attended the memorial service for Mao
 on Saturday in Peking's Tienanmen Square. This was the first
 time since May 1971, Mao's last public appearance, that the en-
 tire leadership appeared before the Chinese people.
 The leaders were arranged in strict protocol order,
 revealing no changes in the alignment. Mao's unpopular wife,
 Chiang Ching,  stood in political rank order with the rest of the
 leadership and was accorded no special status--for the public
 record,  at least--as Mao's widow.
 I            IPremier Hua Kuo-feng, who was identified as first vice
 cnairm. of the party and premier, posts he has held since
 April,  delivered a 20-minute eulogy. Hua's remarks, touching on
 all aspects of the Chinese political scene,  seemed designed to
 placate civilian and military leaders of all political stripes
 and suggested that no single faction in the leadership had the
 upper hand in drafting the eulogy.
 Hua included a low-key reference to the current cam-
 paign  o criticize the ousted Teng Hsiao-ping, praised the mil-
 itary, took several swipes at the Soviet Union,  and mentioned
 the need to carry on Mao's revolutionary foreign policy line--a
 codeword for the opening to the US.
 An abbreviated list of others who attended the memorial
 service shed no new light on the status of several officials
 who have come under attack since the anti-Teng campaign began.
 Although almost the entire party Central Committee,  including
 most of the province chiefs, appeared in Peking during the mourn-
 ing period, very few were mentioned on the list. Presumably,
 most of these people attended the memorial service and will re-
 main in Peking for a major party meeting to begin the arduous
 process of arranging for a successor leadership.
 PORTUGAL: Moving Against Squatters

 land they illegally occupied after the 1974 coup.  If he goes
 through with the plan,  it would be his government's first
 important test of strength.//
 Soares' decision probably reflects the increasing
 pressure he has been under to show some progress in straighten-
 ing out the Portuguese economy. Although the squatters have
 generally maintained production, they evidently have run the
 farms very inefficiently and used the profits to subsidize Com-
 munist Party activities rather than repaying sizable agricul-
 tural loans to the state. The government approved legislation
 on September 14 authorizing forcible collection of these loans,
 thereby putting further pressure on the Communist rural workers'
 union.
 I             ICommunist resistance on the farms themselves would
 not be the only problem for the government. The Communists will
 oppose the present plan in the parliament, where they control
 the agricultural committee. They could create further trouble
 in the Agriculture Ministry, where party members occupy some
 posts. The Communists might also use their influence in the
 Portuguese labor movement to stir up workers in other parts of
 the economy.
 Left-wing leaders in Soares' own Socialist Party--
 led by Agriculture Minister Lopes Cardoso--reportedly are
 opposed to pressing the Communists too hard. Soares thus might
 even split his own party if the government moves forcefully.

 /Some of Parama's economic problems are beyond
 orrijos  control. The world recession triggered Panama's eco-
 nomic slump two years ago. Recently, a serious drought has
 dimmed prospects for the agricultural sector, the only area of
 significant economic growth last year.//
 //In addition, the government's uneasy relations
 with the private sector have probably contributed to the sharp
 drop in local investment. Large public expenditures and am-
 bitious long-term projects necessitated foreign borrowing,
 which will probably also contribute to the economic problems.//
 /Panama's public debt, most of it external,  is
 already  high and projected to rise to $250 million or $300
 million by 1980--giving Panama one of the highest per capita
 debt rates in the world. According to the US embassy, direct
 debt service obligations would then amount to one third or
 more of central government revenues. Panama has initiated a
 number of major revenue-producing projects, but none will take
 effect before 1980.//
 //Panama's ability to secure foreign loans has
 emsen its  financial burden in the past, but there could be
 growing questions about the government's creditworthiness. Re-
 cent, more pessimistic economic projections and the government's
 failure to conclude negotiations for a new canal treaty will
 complicate the search for loans.//
 //The government has tended to neglect its domes-
 tic problems,  emphasizing instead Torrijos' forays abroad in
 search of support for Panama's stand on treaty issues. The
 demonstrations may persuade Torrijos that he must pay greater
 attention to domestic needs, convince the public that some belt-
 tightening is necessary, and--in the absence of an economic
 turnaround--secure a new canal treaty.

 Chile is convinced that Pact rules on foreign invest-
 ment have greatly hampered its ability to attract foreign capi-
 tal and that complete termination of controls on foreign in-
 vestment will be required to enable Chile to obtain the neces-
 sary foreign capital to accelerate economic growth.
 The Andean Pact Commission adjourned prematurely on
 Thursday after failing to resolve the impasse reached in early
 August when Chile resisted proposed compromises on delays in
 tariff reductions and on direct foreign investment controls.
 Pact officials have characterized the Chilean position as ir-
 reconcilable with those of the other members.
 I                     //During the past month, Chile has attempted to
 prepare public opinion for an early withdrawal from the Pact.
 At the same time, Chile is taking steps to increase economic
 ties with Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Brazil, countries
 with which Chile already has a strong political alignment.//
 Withdrawal from the Andean Pact will not cause Chile
 to tor eit the benefits of intra-common market trade concessions
 already received.
 USSR: Yakubovsky Ill
 Warsaw Pact Commander in Chief Marshal Yakubovsky
 was not mentioned in Soviet news coverage of the recently con-
 cluded Pact joint exercise,  "Shield-76." This tends to corrob-
 orate a report that Yakubovsky has been seriously ill since
 spring.
 I         IAn obituary for a retired general in Krasnaya Zvezda
 on September 14 has Yakubovsky's name in its usual position
 immediately after Minister of Defense Ustinov. This indicates
 that Yakubovsky has not been replaced as Soviet first deputy
 minister of defense and commander in chief of Pact armed forces.
 The Soviet reporting of  "Shield-76" also fails to
 identify anyone occupying the late General Shtemenko's former
 post as first deputy commander in chief and chief of staff of
 Pact armed forces.

 It may be difficult to find replacements who have
 the proper military qualifications and who are also politically
 acceptable to non-Soviet Pact members. Defense Minister Ustinov
 and representatives of Pact member states probably used the
 opportunity presented by "Shield-76" to discuss the question.
 Even though there may be further delay in making the appoint-
 ments, the Soviet leadership will have the decisive voice.
 I                 lengthy delay in the selection of these replace-
 ments could further retard progress under way since 1969 to
 enhance the Pact's command and control posture.

 the USSR's newest medium tan --th e T-   --has been
 introduced into the Soviet ground forces in East Germany. The
 tanks were seen at Bernau just northeast of Berlin. This is
 the first time that the T-72 has been seen in units outside
 the Soviet Union.//
 ]the T-72 has a
 large-caliber,  smooth-bore gun with an automatic loading sys-
 tem that requires one less crew member than other Soviet tanks.
 The tanks reportedly have improved armor and a better suspen-
 sion system and are lower and faster than the present tank
 models in East Germany. Development of the T-72 began in the
 1960s, and full-scale production has been under way since 1974.
 I            lEast Germany is reportedly seeking up to $400 million
 in cre i s from Western banks to finance large imports of grain
 and fodder.  Severe drought has destroyed a large portion of this
 year's harvest.
 I                          We estimate East Germany's total grain import
 requirements to be at least 4 million tons, valued at $600 to
 $700 million. About 3 million tons will probably be acquired

 from the US; purchases of US wheat and corn already exceed 2.2
 million tons. The balance will have to come from other Western
 suppliers.
 The need to import large amounts of grain on credit
 will ad-d--substantially to East Germany's debt. Western banks
 may be willing to finance these purchases, although at higher
 rates than normally charged to East Germany.
 East Germany's hard currency debt has risen substan-
 tially in recent years--from $1 billion at the end of 1970 to
 $3.8 billion at the end of 1975.  It still has a comparatively
 low debt service ratio and should have no difficulty meeting
 its current obligations.

 violence caused last month by the return of Thanom's former
 deputy, field marshal Praphat.//
 //Although leftist student leaders are considering
 demonstrations,// they may find it difficult to gather much
 support. Thanom never inspired the intense dislike that was
 felt toward Praphat. Thanom's entry into the monkhood is a
 gesture that undoubtedly meets with general approval, and one
 hard for the students to oppose.
 Moreover,  the deaths and injuries that resulted from
 the confrontations last month should have reduced student ea-
 gerness to take to the streets. Some demonstrations will prob-
 ably take place, but they are not likely to create the turmoil
 that greeted Thanom's return two years ago.

 SWEDEN:  Social Democrats Upset
 I      ISweden's Social Democrats suffered their first defeat
 in near y 44 years in yesterday's election. With approximately
 90 percent of the vote counted, the three non-socialist parties
 appeared to have won a clear majority, although the final offi-
 cial tally will not be known until midweek.
 I       IComputer projections give the Center,  Liberal, and
 onserva ive parties a total of 180 seats, against 169 for the
 Social Democrats and their Communist Party allies, in the 349,
 seat parliament. Swedish election analysts claim the final re-
 sult is not likely to vary more than one or two seats from the
 computer projection.
 Thorbjorn Falldin, chairman of the Center Party,  is
 almost certain to be named prime minister if the non-socialist
 parties can agree on a coalition. The Centrists' and Liberals'
 differences with the Conservatives have thwarted cooperation
 in the past.
 I] Recent statements by the leaders of the three parties,
 howev r, suggest that they will make every effort to put to-
 gether a government this time.  Prime Minister Olaf Palme ap-
 peared convinced that their efforts would succeed when he all
 but conceded defeat in a statement late last night.
 I            Some Social Democratic leaders blamed the loss on the
 opposition's concentration on the nuclear power issue.  In Au-
 gust, Falldin focused on the government's elaborate and expen-
 sive plan for expanding nuclear energy throughout Sweden. Fiye
 nuclear plants are operational and several more are under con-
 struction.
 I           IThe main issues, however, were high taxes and greater
 centralization of the government under successive Social Demp-
 cratic administrations.
 I       IThe nuclear issue could complicate efforts of the
 non-soc   list parties to cooperate among themselves. Some Con-
 servatives,  for example, have supported nuclear expansion and
 may have difficulty rationalizing unified opposition to it.
 This is just one of a number of issues a non-socialist coalition
 may have to resolve in order to govern.

 The new government will be formally announced when
 parliament convenes on October 4.  If the non-socialist parties
 succeed in forming a coalition headed by Falldin, he is likely
 to insist that deputy Center Party chairman Johannes Antonsson
 be his foreign minister. Speculation on other key cabinet posts
 in such a government include Conservative Party leader Gosta
 Bohman as defense minister and Per Ahlmark, head of the Liberal
 Party, as finance minister. F7                  I     25X1
