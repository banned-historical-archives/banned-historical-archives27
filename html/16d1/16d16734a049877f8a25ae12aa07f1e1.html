 WASHINGTON POST
 hi
 By Bill Richards and John Jacobs
 SS's;hi!u: oa Pont Stab writers
 The Central Intelligence Agency
 used the University of Maryland
 and George Washington University
 for some of its top secret IIKUL-
 TRA experiments in behavior con-
 trol in the 1950s and 1900s, tlic
 agency has informed both univer??
 sities.
 The CIA also officially informed
 Georgetown University that it had
 sheltered some of the MKULTRA ex-
 periments. Georgetown's part in the
 project had been previously reported
 but not officially confirmed.
 The three local universities were
 among 80 private and public institu-
 tions told in the past few days they
 had played parts-some  wittingly,
 some not-in the IIKULTR 1 tests.
 In a related development, the CIA
 yesterday made  public  under the
 Freedom of Information Act an addi-
 tional 1,760 pages of documents per-
 taining to MIKULTRA behavior con-
 trol experiments.
 These documents show that many
 high-ranidng agency officials knew
 and approved at least the Georgetown
 part of- the mind control program, in-
 cluding  then-CIA  Director  Allen
 Dulles and senior aides Richard M.
 Bissell Jr., C. P. Cabell, Lyman Kirk-
 patrick, Lawrence Houston and Rich-
 ard Heltns. helms later became CIA
 director.
 The documents show that anion,'
 things tested at Georgetown were sub-.
 stances to promote "Illogical thinking
 and impulsiveness to the point where
 the recipient would be discredited .in
 public," and substances to promote
 and prevent "the intoxicating effect of
 alcohol."
 Another reference in the documents
 The agency was also interested in
 "a knockout pill which can surrepti-
 tiously be  administered in  drinks,
 food, cigarettes, as an aerosol," to pro-
 vide a "maximum of amnesia,". and a
 substance, also to be administered
 surreptitiously, that would make it
 "Impossible for a man to perform any
 physical activity whatsoever."
 The documents  also referred  to
 tests of a "knockout" drug on termi-
 nally ill cancer patients at George-
 town.
 The documents say the uni\"crsity
 administration was to be '*totally un-
 witting" of CIA sponsorship of the as-
 sorted mind control experiments.
 A  CIA spokesman said  yesterday
 that the agency had located all but sb:
 of the 80 institutions and companies
 involved in MKULTRA. "The -others
 no longer exist," said the spokesman,
 who declined to give the names of any
 of the institutions or firms involved.
 None of the three Washington-area!
 universities notified could theniselvesl
 supply details of the types of i\IKUL-
 TI:A experiments in which they wereI
 involved. However, spokesmen for all'
 three said they. would take advantage
 of a CIA offer to supply - dditional de-
 tails on .request.
 In its letter to University of Mary-
 land  President  WiLon' H.- Elkins;
 which arrived ' last Friday, the CIA.
 said: "While we recognize this may be
 unwelcome news we believe we have
 an obligation to advise you of this fact'
 [MKULTRA participation] so that you
 may initiate such action as you deem
 necessary- to protect the interests of
 -z-our university."

 ASHINGTON    There  seemed  to  be
 nothing the Central intelligence, Agency
 drugs,. hypnosis, mental telepathy, depriva -:
 lights. The agency even consulted magicians and employed
 ;
 ostitutesii-
 But_ nothing gave. the agency the formula it sought
 for creating its own Manchurian candidate. And. last week,
 under attack again -for having violated ethical norms in
 their psychological experiments," agency` officals maintained
 that "they'were through tampering with the human mind.
 They hastened to add, however, that they' had not aban-
 doned the aspect of their 25-year exploration 'into the world
 of psychiatry that was perhaps the most benign and may
 have been the only blossom in a rank garden:. The construc=
 tion of elaborate personality profiles of employees in sensi-
 tive jobs, potential. agents and international military and
 political figures.
 "The work we're doing iiow does not involve attempts'
 to modify behavior,",Admiral Stansfield Turner, the director
 of the agency, told a Senate hearing last week. "It involves
 studying it." He said that "the kind of thing we're interested
 in is what will motivate a man to become an agent of
 the United States. is a very difficult' situation: We have
 to be familiar with the attitudes and responses of people
 we approach to become our spies."
 Intelligence 'officials call these psychological studies
 "personality assessment." Potential spies are indeed as-
 sessed, but the sweep of_ the program is much greater than
 the admiral suggested. The agency has developed "personality
 assessments" of Fidel Castro and the late Che Guevara,
 Mao Tse-tung and his successors, the leaders of the Kremlin
 -and the chiefs of state of most of the nations regarded
 as allies of the United States. "You do it on friends and
 enemies alike," said one intelligence specialist, "because
 you can never know when someone's going to switch."
 When the President of the United States goes to meetings
 abroad, he is armed with assessments of the officials he
 will confront, as were members of the United States negoti-
 ating team at the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty talks.
 At times the assessment program has overstepped the
 bounds of the agency's charter, which forbids operations
 directed against Americans inside the United States. The
 agency ordered a personality study of Daniel Ellsberg when
 he was awaiting trial for allegedly having given the Penta-
 gon Papers to The New York Times. An assessment was
 done also of Mr. Ellsberg's lawyer, Leonard Boudin. E. How-
 ard Hunt, a former intelligence agent who was jailed for
 `. A personality assessment Is simply a guide to an indi-
 vidual's behavior. It describes his weaknesses and strengths,
 :predicts" actions and reactions,- and suggests how he can
 be influenced. The psychologist preparing an assessment
 for the agency asks: What are the person's principles? His
 habits? Is he a drinker, a woman-chaser, a reader, a jogger, "
 a hockey fan, a chess player, a chain-smoker, a'dog lover,
 a Sunday morning gardener? Who are his friends?.Where
 is he from? Who was his father?
 Usually the psychologist is unable to interview the
 subject.,So he works with photographs and reports provided
 by agents and other Government employees and informants,
 ...published materials, and official records. Whenever possible
 the psychologist likes to have a tape-recording of his sub-
 ject's voice to analyze.
 Personality assessment in one form or another is as
 old as the intelligence profession. But it received increased
 emphasis in the early _1950's from Allen W. Dulles, then
 the director of the agency..Mr. Dulles had sought neurologi-
 cal treatment for his son, who had been . seriously injured
 in Korea. He went "to see Dr. Harold G. Wolfe, a New
 York neurologist.- Mr. Dulles became interested in research
 Dr. Wolfe was 'doing on indoctrination by the Chinese of
 American pilots captured during the Korean War. Before
 long, Dr. Wolfe, at the behest of the agency, had set up
 the Society" for the Investigation of Human Ecology at the
 Cornell Medical Center in New York. The society became
 ,an important mechanism for funding a number of agency
 studies directed.at manipulating human behavior.
 }      The Department of Sociology at Rutgers University was
 1 paid to conduct a study of Hungarian refugees. Dr. D. Ewen
 Cameron of McGill University in Montreal got a grant to
 explore "the effects of repeated verbal signals upon human
 behavior." There was an LSD experiment conducted by a
 team of social and medical scientists at the Massachusetts
 Mental Health Center in Boston. The Educational Testing
 Service of Princeton, N.J., which conducts the National Col-
 lege Board and Graduate Record Examinations, received
 funds to investigate the relationship between two broad
 theories of personality.
 When the society was disbanded in 1965, Col. James
 L. Monroe, a psychologist who had been a senior intelligence
 official, and several others joined another agency-backed
 organization called "Psychological Assessments Inc." After
 Psychological Assessments closed its doors a few years ago,
 Colonel Monroe moved to Texas and set up a firm that
 prepared studies for business and industry. The colonel said
 recently that he hoped the agency had benefited from some
 of his research. "If they're going to make judgments about
 foreign powers," he said, "thr:y've got to know about how
 people function."

 WASHI GTON, : Aug..:1      Several
 prominent medical .research. institutions
 and Government hospitals in the United
 States and Canada were involved in a
 secret, 25-year, $25-million effort by the
 .Central Intelligence Agency to learn how
 to control the human.mind.
 The existence-of-the agency's lnvestiga-
 jtions into behavior? and thought control
 was- previously known., But through acr
 tens to 2,000 C.LA. documents and -wide-
 rariging interviews; a group of New York
 Times reporters-has developed new infor-
 lmation''about the;:' cost of the program,:
 the range of its penetration into presti
 ous research centers; :the identities of
 some lnst4Eutions,1 the secret funding con-
 about ,the- program expressed by some;

 The original research`.was spurred by
 the conviction-later: proved unfounded

 devices. But the C.I.A: quickly- turned to
 seeking an offensive use for behavior con-

 Mind-Control Studies Had 2

 WASHINGTON, Aug. 1-In the summer
 of 1977, it may be difficult for Americans
 to comprehend the frame of mind of the
 men who nearly 30 years earlier started
 the Central. Intelligence Agency's effort
 to manipulate human behavior.
 ,As some of the former high-ranking
 C.I.A. men recall-now, they had looked
 into the vacant eyes of Joseph Cardinal
 Mindszenty at his treason trial in Buda-
 pest in 1949 and had been horrified.
 They had been convinced that his con-
 'fession had been wrung from him while
 he was either under the influence of some
 mysterious mind-bending drug or that he
 was standing before the dock in a post-
 hypnotic trance. The sight touched off
 memories of earlier "show trials'' in the
 Soviet Union.
 The C.I.A. leaders were certain the
 Communists had. embarked on a cam-
 paign to control men's minds and they
 were determined to find a defense, setting
 out in earnest the next year---190--with
 Project  Bluebird,  which  evolved  into
 Project Artichoke,  then    became MK-
 ULTRA-MK-DELTA. With                                  each code
 name  change,  they      broadened their
 sweep, until there remained virtually no
 avenue of human behavior control they
 were not exploring.

 director, Allen W. Dulles, and a handful
 of operatives and high-ranking aides.
 "Precautions must be taken," one agen-
 cy official wrote in an internal memo,"-
 not only to protect the operation from
 exposure: to enemy forces, but. also to,
 conceal these activities from the Ameri-
 can public in general," adding that this
 information "would have serious repe.r-

 Fragmentary accounts of the C.I.A.'s
 efforts to control men's minds have been
 published in the past. But a far more
 comprehensive. picture has emerged from
 a study of more than 2,000 pages of fresh-
 ly released agency documents and an in-
 vestigation bya_team of New York Times
 reporters.                         _
 The behavior control, undertaken by
 amen who presumably saw themselves as
 sincere and patriotic, takes on in retro-
 spect the appearance of a bizarre grope
 into the world of science fiction. The
 C.I.A. investigators let their imaginations
 run: Was there a way to dissolve the
 Berlin Wall? What about a knockout drug
 that could incapacitate an entire building
 full of people? A pill that would make
 a drunk man sober; a way to manufacture
 food that looked and tasted normal but,
 when eaten, would create "confusion-
 anxiety-fear.."
 Rubber From Mushrooms?
 Subsequent developments seemed to
 confirm their fears: The arrest in Germa-
 ny of two Soviet agents armed with iden-
 tical plastic cylinders containing hypoder-
 mic needles, said to cause a victim "to
 become amenable to the will of his cap-
 tor." Then, the startling confessions of
 downed American airmen to false charges
 of carrying out germ warfare against
 ..North Korea.
 A short time later, however, in 1953,
 a high level military study group deter-
 mined that events had not been what
 ;they seemed. Neither the Russians nor
 anyone else had devised a means of turn-
 ing men into robots and there was "little
 threat, if any, to national security."
 The intelligence community rational-'
 ized: They would go ahead anyway,.
 against the chance that the Communists
 might some day live up to their dread.
 Furthermore, they saw great potential in
 developing these tools For their. awn of-
 fensive use.            .
 There was an "urgent need;" the C.I:A.
 and other intelligence- agencies `argued,..
 to develop "effective and practical tech-
 niques" to "render an individual subservi-
 ent to an imposed wilt or control."
 The-C.I.A. men, who led the way, en-
 listing the support of the Army, the Navy,
 the Air Force, the Departments of Age-
 cult-ore, Health, . Education and. Welfare
 and several other. agencies, acknowledged
 among therriselves that much of what
 they vrere.setting out.to do.was.."unethL

 wildered, self-doubting mass to "subvert
 his principles," a C.I.A. document said.
 They wanted to direct him in ways that
 .,may vary from rationalizing a disloyal
 act to the construction of a new person."
 One of their longest running goals was
 to develop a way to induce amnesia. They
 wanted to be able to interrogate enemy
 espionage agents in such a way that nei
 then the agents nor their superiors would
 know they had.been compromised, and
 they - wanted to be - able- to wipe clean
 the memories of their own agents after
 certain missions' and, especially, when.
 they were going into retirement.    "-
 . They were interested in simple destruc-
 tion, too, As with the other business that
 glade-amnesia, so attractive; they wanted
 to be able to get away with murder with-

 An Expert's Suggestions
 One apparent medical- or Scientific ex-
 pert, whose- identity has been, deleted
 from the documents, suggested- that- the
 Qd ri t M ght =aRD9*    Or   9!
 in a small, air-tight room with a chunk
 of dry ice,. giving off suffocating carbon
 dioxide gas. He- also proposed reducing
 They conducted interviews with scien-
 tists and doctors and members of other
 intelligence agencies around the world.
 .They studied the writing of the psycholo-
 gist who worked with Adolf Hitler, won-
 dered about the use of the "occult" and
 of "black psychiatry," and of, course
 pored over their own stream of intelli-
 gence- data.
 There was on agent's report of a "con-
 fession gang" that had arrived.in Shang-
 hai, and, without the use of "old-fash-
 ioned torture or drugs," could- obtain
 .,any confession they desire." In one case,
 the report from China went, "the prisoner
 was not allowed to close his eyes for
 26 days-"
 i+fost of the ideas the C.I.A. considered
 never got off the drawing board. For a
 few years in the early 1950's, though,
 the agency had one or two "special inter-
 rogation'' teams that went on operational
 missions in Europe and Asia. A team was
 supposed to consist of a psychiatrist, a
 hypnotist and an interrogator and was
 to elicit information through the. use of
 drugs and hypnotism.
 In actual practice, the size of the teams
 and the procedure they followed varied.
 In one series of interrogations in Europe,
 for example, they employed neither hyp-
 notism nor a combination of drugs and
 hypnotism-the very essence "of special
 interrogation" at the time--because the
 psychiatrist was in a hurry to resume
 an interrupted vacation-and no hypnotist
 was available.
 11 Days or Questioning
 police in. civilian clothes, the team ques-
 tioned three European espionage agentsI
 who had been working for the C.I.A. "be- I
 hind the Iron Curtain" and whose loyalty
 had become suspect.  .
 - Over-1 1 ? days, - the three, agents were
 individually given intravenous injections
 of an unidentified drug-possibly sodium
 pentathal--then engaged by the interro-
 gator and the psychiatrist in fantasies.
 . The -team decided that all three agents
 had responded to? questions truthfully and
 should be continued in operational use:
 But they reported in the document that
 one of the agents who had resisted the
 effects of the drugs-and later disappoint-
 ED011ieGZ"tors by making reference
 to the "solution" that was injected, thus
 giving_ no  indication  of  "amnesia,"        `~:rf
