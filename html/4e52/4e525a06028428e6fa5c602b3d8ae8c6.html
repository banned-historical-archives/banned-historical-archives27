DAILY BRIEF 
L THE COMMUNIST BLOC 
Soviet Union - UAR: Moscow has informed the UAR High 
Dam committee that survey work and detailed plans concern-
ing the Aswan Dam have been completed almost three weeks 
ahead of schedule and that Soviet experts are now prepared 
to discuss construction details with UAR representatives. 
Moscow is evidently trying to reassure Cairo that Soviet eco-
nomic aid is not tied to oli " al relations between the two 
countries. (Page 1) 
Tibet: Chinese Communist forces have by now probably 
broken up �cncentrations of rebels in southeaatern Tibet, 
although the terrain permits continued activity by small groups. 
the Chinese are trying to 
seai me main passes on the southern Tibet border and have 
blocked the escape route used by the Dalai Lama. Possibly 
5,000 Tibetan refugees have so far entered India and Bhutan, 
but it will now be increasingly difficult to cross the border, 
Sib-Indian relations continue to deteriorate) 
(Page 2) 
*USSR�Nuclear test talks: The Soviet delegate to the 
Geneva talks stated on 28 April that if the number of inspec-
tions of suspected nuclear explosions to be permitted each 
year is agreed upon in advance, the USSR will drop its de-
mand for a veto on the dispatch of inspection teams. In 
addition, the USSR will agree to permanent inspection groups 
in the USSR, and permit automatic inspection when control-
system instruments indicate a suspicious event. However, 
the Soviet representative contended that the annual number 
of inspections to be allowed was a political decision and not 
related to any technical information or report. In his 23 April 
letter to President Eisenhower, Khrushchev said there would 
?!naturally" be few such in

'turf 
Turkey-Iraq: nkara is increasingly concerned over the 
gravity of the Communist threat in Iraq and its implications 
for Turkish security. Prime Minister Menderes has requested 
immediate US-Turkish talks on the question. Meanwhile, Turk 
ish officials have announced that 700 Kurdish tribesmen from 
Iraq have been granted asyrm These are the first refugees  
noted crossing this border. 
Sin apore: (Chief Minister Lim Yew Hock's efforts to unite 
modera, e forces to oppose the Communist-infiltrated People's 
Action party in the 30 May general elections have thus far failed. 
The moderates have nominated a large number of competing can-
didates. In contrast the People's Action party has filed a 
strong slate of candidates restricted to one for each assembly 
seat) (Page 3) 
III. THE WEST 
West Germany: 6.,_d enauer still strongly opposes selection 
of Economics Minister Erhard as the next chancellor,feeling that 
It would be difficult to dominate Erhard from the presidency. 
Finance Minister Etzel is Adenauer's choice. If Adenauer tries 
to block his nomination, Erhard plans to force a showdown vote 
in the Christian Democratic Union party caucus, where he now is 
supported by about 200 out of 270 votes. A date for choosing the 
new chancellor has not been decided on by the CDU leadership) 
(Page 4) 
France-Guinea: (t'rance has implied it may react to Guinea's 
receipt of arms shipments from Czechoslovakia by undertaking 
military intervention in Guinea. De Gaulle's diplomatic adviser 
describes Guinea's neighbors which are members of the French 
community as most anxious regarding Guinea's intentions. De 
Gaulle has turned down the American-British suggestion that 
France promptly appoint an ambassador to Conakry as an ex-
pression of Western friendship) (Page 5)

Panama: The armed invaders apparently have not gained 
the local support which they expected from opponents of _Pres-
ident de la Guardia. Prompt reaction by the Organization of 
American States and the delivery of US military equipment to 
the National Guard have thus far deterred opponents of De la 
Guardia who might otherwise have moved against him.

IV. CONCLUSIONS OF SPECIAL USIB COMMITTEE 
ON BERLIN SITUATION 
The USIB has taken note of the following conclusions reached 
by its special committee on the Berlin situation. The committee 
pointed out that its conclusions were to be used in context with 
SNIE 100-2-59 (24 February 1959) and with the review of that es-
timate in SNIE 100-2/1-59 (17 March 1959): 
1. There are as yet no clear indications of Soviet 
negotiating tactics at Geneva: (a) By such moves as the 
21 April notes to the US and West Germany, the USSR is 
seeking to divide the Western allies and soften Western 
positions. The Soviets are also preparing the ground for 
blaming the West for any failure to reach agreement. 
(b) While there are no clear indications of what will 
emerge from the meeting of bloc foreign ministers at 
Warsaw, it appears to be intended primarily as a dem-
onstration of bloc unity and a counter to the Paris meet-
ing of the Western foreign ministers. 
2. A West German poll shows that willingness to 
risk hostilities over the Berlin access question is far 
stronger in West Berlin than West Germany. There were 
no significant changes in the West Berlin economy and 
morale.

ing.

Intent in the near future to blockade Allied or West

Berlin from the bloc. However, the Soviets could  take

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC 
Moscow Seeks to Dispel UAR Fears of Economic Reprisals  
Moscow is attempting to show the UAR that the Soviet 
Union plans no economic reprisals for Nasir's anti-Commu-
nist campaign in the Middle East. On the heels of Khrushchev's 
conciliatory letter to Nasir, Radio Moscow announced in reply 
to UAR and Western press comments that "any talk of stoppage 
of Soviet aid to the UAR has no foundation." Since then Moscow 
has informed the UAR High Dam committee�almost three weeks 
ahead of schedule--that the study and detailed plans for the Aswan 
High Dam have been completed, and that Soviet experts are pre-
pared to discuss details of construction with UAR representatives. 
Cairo, for its part, has announced that the UAR minister of public 
works will head a committee of experts who are scheduled to fly 
to Moscow next we 7k for further discussion concerning the dam. 
Now that final deliveries of a 200,000-ton wheat consignment 
are being made, shipments of machinery, fertilizer, paper, and 
other commercial goods are beginning to arrive at Egyptian ports. 
Additional deliveries are being scheduled, 
Bloc petroleum shipments to the UAR also 
are continuing. Thus far in 1959 they have averaged 200,000 tons a 
month, well above last year's monthly average 01 150,000 tons.

Tibetan Situation 
.6-11 concentrations of Tibetan rebel forces have probably 
been broken by Chinese Communist troops driving into the 
Khamba-occupied area of southeastern Tibet, 
Despite Peiping's intense effort to crush 
the revolt, however, the rugged terrain and availability of local 
food sources will permit continuing activity by small rebel bands, 
 the Tibetan capital 
was "absolutely quiet," but :he Chinese were making every 
effort to seal Tibet's borders with Bhutan, Nepal, and India. 
They have blocked the escape route used by the Dalai Lama, 
he said. Possibly 5,000 refugees, however, have succeeded 
in reaching Bhutan or India within recent weeks, and small 
groups are expected, with i reasing difficulty, to continue 
straggling across the border 
Sino-Indian relations have deteriorated to their lowest 
level in years. The National People's Congress heard a parade 
of speakers charging Indian officials with "expansionist" denial 
of China's sovereignty over Tibet and with complicity in the 
Dalai Lama's statement denying abduction from Tibet. Press 
reports from New Delhi state that on 27 April the Chinese Com-
munists had officially protested the defacing of Mao Tse-tung's 
picture by an Indian mob. 
Prime Minister Nehru, angered by Chinese Communist 
attacks on India despite his efforts to calm the situation, has 
accused Peiping of using the "language of the cold war." He 
said Peiping's charges against India were "so fantastic I find 
it difficult to deal with them." He stated that he had made a 
formal protest to Peiping. Nehru apparently believes that his 
past efforts to avoid recriminations have been interpreted in 
Peiping as a sign of weakness and intends to make Communist 
China aware that such charges could have serious effects on 
Sino-Indian relations.

II. ASIA-AFRICA 
Prospects for Left-Wing Victory in Singapore Elections  
Enhanced 
6.ailure of the conservative political parties in Singapore 
to reach agreement on a unified slate for the 30 May general 
elections has greatly enhanced the prospects of the Communist-
infiltrated People's Action party (PAP). Party officials now be-
lieve the PAP will win 30 to 40 of the 51 Legislative Assembly 
seats at stake. The party's strong list of candidates includes 
the popular former mayor, Ong Eng Guan, and 12 city councilors 
who resigned from office on 18 April. The PAP appareqly has 
avoided serious competition from other left-wing parties) 
(The other Singapore parties have nominated numerous com-
peting candidates despite Chief Minister Lim Yew Hock's plans to 
form an anti-PAP coalition to prevent fragmentation of the mod-
erate vote, Lim's moderate Singapore People's Alliance nominated 
39 candidates and the conservative Liberal Socialists 32. In addition, 
there are 34 independent candidates as well as nominees represent-
ing ten other parties. Even Lim may have trouble retaining a Leg-
islative Assembly seat in his supposedly "safe" district. The PAP 
candidate in this contest may slip through with a plurality victory 
while Lim splits the non-PAP votes with his bitter enemy, former 
Chief Minister David Marshall, and with a Liberal Socialist candi-
date) 
6hief Minister Lim may be able to force the withdrawal of 
some of the moderate candidates. It is doubtful, however, if any 
action taken by him at this late date, short of instigating disorders 
to force postponement of the elections, can reverse the trend toward 
a PAP victory)

Nov 
eii-auer Strongly Opposed to Erhard as West German  
Chancellor 
(West German Chancellor Adenauer strongly opposes Eco-
nomics Minister Erhard as his successor because he thinks 
Erhard will not be firm enough in foreign nolinv. 
  Adenauer feels that Erhard would be "soft or compro-
mising" in situations calling for firmness and would be inclined 
to cooperate with the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD9 
Cinance Minister Etzel is Adenauer's choice. A CDU Bun-
destag deputy, who is a strong supporter of Adenauer, believes 
the chancellor is convinced that as president he can dominate 
Etzel but not Erhard. Krone believes that Adenauer might ulti-
mately attempt to reject the presidency and remain as chancellor 
rather than accept Erhard as his successor) 
If Adenauer attempts to block Erhard's nomination by ac-
clathation, Erhard is prepared to force a showdown vote in the 
CDU Bundestag faction, where he is supported by 200 out of 270 
deputies. He is reported to have been assured of the support 
of 55 Bavarian deputies and expect8 opposition only from among 
the 87 deputies from North Rhine -.Westphalia, the Etzel-Adenauer 
stronghold.) 
Ehe SPD leadership is seeking legal grounds to compel Ade-
nauer to resign as chancellor as soon as he is elected president 
on 1 July, thus forcing the issue of appointing a new chancellor 
and aggravating the tension within the CDU. One argument is 
that Adenauer should resign since as chancellor he would initiate 
political decisions which he would later be called on to consider 
as president  thereby violating tliP nonpartisan character of the 
presidency.)1

France May Plan Military Intervention in Guinea 
The French representative to the tripartite talks on Africa 
stated that France takes an "extremely serious view" of recent 
developments 51 Guinea and implied that France may undertake 
military action 
members of the French Cam.-
munity which are neighbors of Guinea are "most anxious" regard-
ing Conakry's intentions. Paris also charges that by accepting 
bloc overtures Guinea has failed to observe its January treaty 
arrangements with France) 
(1ollowing the arrival in Conakry last month of Czech mili-
tary and other material, a Polish vessel unloaded further 'VIM" 
from Eastern Europe on 16 April. Included in this consignment 
were 500 tons of obsolete arms, including three light tanks and 
four trucks, and 700 tons of nonmilitary items. A third shipment, 
reportedly consisting of 600 tons of "machines," is expected to 
reach Guinea soon) 
Paris does not feel that sending economic aid or strengthen-
ing security forces in surrounding areas are appropriate measures 
for counteracting possible Communist penetration of Africa through 
Guinea, De Gaulle on 24 April "vetoed" the British-American rec-
ommendation that France promptly appoint an ambassador to Conakry 
as an expression of Western friendship. The British, however, are 
considering accrediting their ambassador resident in Monrovia 
simultaneously to Conakry. Soviet ambassador Gerasimov, with a 
staff of seven, arrived in Conakry by air on 16 April. A Czech 
charg�resented his credentials on 11 April and a Bulgarian 
ambassador has been in residence in Conakry since late January. 
In view of De Gaulle's insistence on the need for US-UK-French 
consultation and cooperation on world-wide defense planning, 
with Africa as a special sphere of French responsibility, he may 
make his handling of the Guinea problem the immediate test case 
of his own version of the meaning of We  tern solidarity)

The Situation in Panama 
The prompt reaction of other American countries to the 
recent invasion of Panama has probably strengthened the un-
stable De la Guardia government and discouraged support for 
the invaders from other antiadministration groups. The Cuban 
origin of the armed expedition and of most of its members as 
well as the apparent lack of feasible postinvasion plans, has 
probably made De la Guardia's numerous opponents wary of 
any appearance of cooperation with the invaders. 
The Council of the Organization of American States in re-
sponse to Panamanian appeals for help, sent an investigating 
committee on 28 April and recommended that member states 
entertain favorably Panamanian requests for arms. Nicaragua 
and Guatemala have offered to send military aid, and the US 
delivered arms and other equipment on 27 April for the Pana-
manian National Guard to use against the revolutionaries. In 
addition, the Cuban Government has condemned participation 
by its citizens in the attack and promised stringent action against 
them, although some Cuban officials may have been aware of the 
expedition preparations. 
(,me students and other anti-US extremists in Panama re-
portedly have plans, however, to incite disorders to commem-
orate the serious student-guard riots of May 1958. These may 
take the form of harassing outbreaks against the unpopular Na-
tional Guard, a politically dominated urban police force which 
has been disconcerted by the scattered small revolts and land-
ings of the past month) 
Guard commandant Vallarino5 whose support of De la Guardia 
has been the president's main strength has appeared doubtful of 
the guard's willingness and ability to fight the invasion force. He 
and other members of the ruling clique were extremely nervous, 
but the OAS actions should help to stabilize the internal situation 
also.
