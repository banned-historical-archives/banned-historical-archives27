 If you approve, I would like to send this

 Casey has an earlier draft with him in
 Florida -- at his request -- and is aware of
 the plan to offer the paper to the Cabinet officers
 who will be dealing with Zhao.  However, I don't
 know whether Casey approves of the paper, since
 I haven't heard from him.  My guess is that he
 would not object to our sending it out before
 he returns.

 SUBJECT       :   Zhao Ziyang's Visit to Washington:  His Needs and
 Expectations
 The Foreign Policy Setting
 Premier Zhao Ziyang's visit to Washington comes at a time when the
 Chinese leadership is trying to consolidate its current improved relations
 with the United States in accordance with decisions taken early in 1983 --
 probably following Secretary Shultz's visit to Beijing -- and reconfirmed at
 the Party's Second Plenum held just after Secretary Weinberger's visit.
 --   The decision to consolidate relations appears to reflect recognition
 that the deterioration in US-Chinese ties -- which lasted from 1980
 through the signing of the Taiwan Arms Sales Communique in 1982 --
 weakened rather than strengthened China's ability to manage relations
 with the two superpowers.  In this sense, the decision was defensive;
 it was designed to prevent a downward drift.
 --   The decision also reflects Chinese recognition that it might be
 dealing with the Reagan administration through 1988.  In this
 situation, the Chinese probably believe their best course is to
 consolidate the relationship at its current improved level, since
 they probably do not expect much further deepening of political or
 strategic ties over the next few years.  Economic and commercial
 relations are a different matter:  the Chinese look forward to steady
 improvements.
 The pace and scope of the improved relationship is attested to by the
 number of visitors that flowed between Beijing and Washington in 1983 --
 Secretaries Shultz, Baldridge and Weinberger to Beijing and Ministers Wu,

 Wang, Gao, He and Qian to Washington.  These high level visits were buttressed
 by concrete accomplishments -- a textile agreement, Chinese engagement of
 legal counsel in the Huguang bond case, progress on technology transfer and
 exploration of military sales and exchanges.
 Impact of Taiwan
 Although Taiwan is not an immediate territorial issue in Beijing --
 Chinese expectations of achieving reunification with Taiwan any time soon are
 nil -- Deng Xiaoping and his circle have long held that the road to Taipei
 runs through Washington.  Only Washington, they claim, can persuade Taipei to
 display flexibility on reunification arrangements.  Having given up the notion
 of solving the territorial issue in his lifetime, Deng probably believes that
 discussions with Taipei about reunification -- even though they may last for
 years or even decades -- are an acceptable, face-saving substitute.  The
 Chinese expect Washington to help.
 --  But Zhao will not ask for direct US help in starting discussions with
 Taipei.  Beijing believes, however, that large US arms sales to
 Taiwan and continuing high level contacts impede reunification, and
 Zhao will probably urge that both be cut back.
 Beijing's leaders also recognize that as the China-born generation
 currently in control on Taiwan makes way for Taiwan-born successors,
 reunification arrangements will become more difficult to negotiate.  Beijing's
 current handling of negotiations with London over Hong Kong's future suggests
 that Chinese leaders do not understand what makes capitalist economies like
 Hong Kong or Taiwan tick.  Moreover, the accelerating divergence between the
 economies and social systems of Taiwan and China will in time make all but
 token reunification more and more unlikely, though even token reunification
 would in itself be significant.
 For Beijing, starting discussions with Taipei, even if they are
 inconclusive, is a way out.
 Zhao will drive this point home in Washington, and, in an effort to
 underscore Chinese seriousness, may repeat the comment Deng made to
 Secretary Weinberger about the possibility of blockading Taiwan if
 peaceful reunification measures fail.  Zhao believes this threat will
 induce Washington to foster discussions.
 Impact of Chinese-Soviet Relations
 Less than two months after Zhao returns to Beijing from Washington, the
 Chinese and the Soviets will sit down in March for their fourth round of
 talks.  A meeting between Chinese and Soviet foreign ministers, the first time
 this has happened since 1969, could come even sooner.  Zhao knows that the
 Chinese hand is strengthened in these talks by Soviet perceptions of stable
 US-Chinese relations.  He also knows that a perception of progress in
 Chinese-Soviet talks heightens anxieties in Washington, thus explaining why
 the Chinese bracket high-level contact between Chinese and US leaders with
 imnortant events in the evolving Sino-Soviet dialogue.

 that the visit will facilitate improvement of China's position in the
 "triangular relationship".
 --  Beijing also believes it can remain in the catbird's seat in the
 Washington-Beijing-Moscow relationship so long as Washington's
 relations with Moscow are severely strained.
 --  And Beijing sees important advantages in remaining there:  the
 two-front threat to China of the 1960s, replaced by the two-front
 threat to Moscow of the 1970s, has given way in the 1980s to a
 reduced threat to China on both the US and Soviet fronts (or so
 Beijing claims).
 Nonetheless, given fundamental obstacles to major improvements in
 Chinese-Soviet relations, China has no alternative to maintaining reasonably
 cordial relations with the US.  Thus, periodic Chinese threats to downgrade
 relations with Washington and improve those with Moscow should be regarded
 mainly as negotiating ploys.  Beijing still clearly views the Soviet Union as
 the principal threat to China,
 as "an expansionist, aggressive power.
 --  Zhao can be expected to reflect these sometimes conflicting
 viewpoints in discussions about the Soviet Union in Washington.
 --  Meanwhile, the Chinese are reassured by evidence of a buildup of US
 forces worldwide and in the Pacific.  Negotiating with Moscow is less
 risky for them in such circumstances.
 Domestic Political Factors in China
 Zhao's visit also comes at a time of heightened Chinese sensitivity
 towards foreign policy issues that involve sovereignty questions, such as
 China's inability to make discernible progress towards reunification with
 Taiwan. Such sensitivities are a response to tensions in Chinese domestic
 politics that resurfaced during 1983, when the modernizers around Deng came
 under pressure from opposition elements who object to portions of Deng's
 program.  Fearing an opposition attack on his policy of an opening to the
 West, which opposition elements have used to attack him in the past, Deng
 coopted their issue and launched his own campaign against "corrupting Western
 influences", esn,-riallv American influences. that tarnish China's youth and
 cultural life,                                                      that promote
 "the interests of bourgeois liberalism.   Repeated public references in the
 campaign to American support for the anti-Communist Sino-American Cooperative
 Organization (SACO), a joint US-KMT intelligence activity that operated during
 World War II, underscores the anti-American theme and may be intended to imply
 that continuing US-KMT cooperation is blocking reunification of Taiwan.
 Deng, Zhao and Party Chairman Hu Yaobang have recently used more
 nationalistic rhetoric when discussing domestic and foreign policy issues.
 They have not, however, abandoned anything important either on their
 modernizing agenda or on the Chinese agenda for US-Chinese relations.  Their
 nationalistic rhetoric is meant to mollif  those o  osed to Den 's policy of
 an open door to the West;

 Zhao is well aware of these opposition currents -- to a limited extent,
 Hu may be a target of the anti-Western campaign, bringing it painfully close
 to Zhao.  As a consequence, Zhao in conversations here is likely to use
 nationalistic rhetoric regarding Taiwan and two-China issues, while pursuing
 the broader goal of promoting stability in US-Chinese relations.
 --   These same currents also increase the pressure on Zhao to succeed in
 Washington:  failure would raise questions not only about Zhao's
 ability to perform well in the West, but also about Deng's major
 foreign policy accomplishment of the last four years -- the
 relationship with Washington.                                  IHu
 spoke without authorization in Japan in November when he questioned
 whether Zhao should visit Washington, thus raising doubts about Hu's
 ability to perform well abroad.
 --  Nonetheless, such nationalistic objectives as reunification with
 Taiwan and settlement of border problems with Moscow, both of which
 affect the US, are long-range, long-term Chinese policies that have a
 life of their own.  Tensions in Chinese domestic politics affect the
 rhetoric with which these objectives are restated, but have less
 effect on the substance.
 Zhao's Personal Political Objectives
 Zhao also comes to Washington with political resources and his prestige
 dependent on a favorable outcome.  Just as China is consolidating its US
 policy, so Zhao must also consolidate his political position as premier.  Less
 successful than Hu in surrounding himself in Beijing with committed
 supporters, he is aware of the fragile nature of the succession architecture
 drafted by Deng; he knows it depends on managing relations between himself and
 Hu, perhaps in a kind of analogue to the relationship that once existed
 between Brezhnev and Kosygin.
 Hu's stock is falling, thus presenting opportunities ano
 risks for Zhao.   A successful visit will strengthen his position in part by
 demonstrating that he can handle foreigners skillfully, long recognized as an
 attribute of leadership.  In this context, it is not surprising that Zhao's
 advance party pushed hard for extensive TV and print media coverage.  They
 hope it will play well in Beijing, though it is worth nothing that the viewing
 audience that counts there is the Central Committee, not the public as the
 Chinese sometimes claim..  Zhao probably also. intends to use such coverage to
 explain Beijing's position on the Taiwan issue directly to Americans.
 In addition, Zhao has gradually become identified with China's US
 relationship, as Deng moves into the background and designates Zhao -- not Hu
 -- as the successor picked to deal directly with Americans.  Against the
 backdrop of Deng's successful visit to the US in February 1979, Zhao must also
 succeed in Washington, though not on the same scale.  Moreover, Zhao's visit
 comes only two months after Hu's visit to Japan.  Where Hu came across to some
 Japanese as occasionally ill-mannered and uninformed, Zhao undoubtedly hopes
 to etch a more polished image.  In doing so, he must show his Central
 Committee constituency that he can consolidate current improved relations with
 the US, while at the same time using nationalistic rhetoric at appropriate

 moments.  It is a difficult assignment and puts Zhao under considerable
 pressure.
 When Secretary Shultz visited Beijing in January and discussed a possible--
 Zhao visit to the US, the Chinese evidenced concern about whether Zhao could
 accomplish something substantial in Washington.  Nonetheless, the symbolic
 aspect of a leadership visit to Washington cannot be overestimated.  Forced to
 conduct its foreign policy from a position of weakness, among the poorest of
 the developing countries, China's leaders continue to seek acceptance and
 legitimacy in the world community.  Visits of foreign leaders to Beijing and
 of Chinese leaders to foreign capitals confer a kind of legitimacy, and among
 these none is more important than a visit to Washington.  Thus Zhao's visit
 itself conveys a symbolic message that the Chinese media will define as
 evidence of superpower courtship:  China is treated as a global, not regional
 power; her friendship is sought; Zhao is an accepted world leader.  As a
 consistently substantiated source explained it in December, Beijing believes
 its influence in the international arena will increase as a result of the
 visit.
 Zhao's Checklist for Washington Discussions
 Zhao's checklist undoubtedly contains positive and negative points, and
 the Chinese must choose between making them publicly or privately.
 --  They can make their points publicly in scheduled interviews with the
 three TV networks; in discussions with Washington Post, Newsweek, or
 New York Times editorial boards; or in the toast that Zhao will give
 during the state dinner at the White House.
 --  They can make their points privately directly with the President or
 the Vice President, or alternatively, with one of the Cabinet
 secretaries whom Zhao will meet.
 Positive points on the checklist probably include signing an extension of
 the US-Chinese scientific and technical agreement, completing a protocol on
 industrial cooperation, announcing a nuclear cooperation agreement and
 discussing Chinese proposals previously raised by Deng regarding confederal
 arrangements on the Korean Peninsula.  On a less concrete level, promotion of
 the transfer of high technology and an increase in American trade and
 investment probably top Zhao's agenda.  He is expected to stress these themes
 with business groups in New York and San Francisco and with Secretaries
 Weinberger, Regan, and Baldridge.  Zhao will also claim (falsely) that China
 never equates US behavior with Soviet behavior around the world, and can also
 be expected to sound Third World themes in public statements.
 Among negative points, Zhao will forcefully criticize US performance on
 the Taiwan issue.
 He will allege publicly and privately that the US is not only
 disregarding commitments made in the Taiwan Arms Sales Communique,
 but is also challenging the Shanghai and Normalization Communiques by
 occasionally implying the existence of something, more than unofficial
 ties with Taiwan.  Zhao told an American governors delegation in
 Beijing in December that he hoped in the US "to improve the American

 people's understanding with regard to the Chinese position on
 Taiwan", thus suggesting an intent to go over the heads of American
 leaders.
 Zhao may also complain about the Pell Resolution and language on
 Taiwan in IMF legislation and other Congressional actions.  He will
 maintain that the Executive Branch is responsible, even though the
 Chinese know better.
 Although pleased with new US positions on technology transfer and arms
 sales, Zhao is likely to complain about slow implementation of both -- he has
 told recent visitors that the new US position is helpful, but controls should
 be reduced further.
 Implications for the US
 As Zhao works through his checklist, US responses can contribute to
 educating the Chinese on areas of convergence -- bright trade prospects,
 common goals in IndoChina, Afghanistan, and to some extent in Korea -- and on
 areas of divergence -- Taiwan; labelling the US as a hegemonist; criticizing
 US policy in Third World areas.
 -- Zhao and his Central Committee constituency have demonstrated a lack
 of understanding of US Taiwan policy that encompasses unofficial
 relations with the people and authorities on Taiwan and support for
 the principle of one China, but that within this framework, also
 encompasses friendly, durable relations between Washington and
 Taipei, including arms sales.  Zhao should recognize that the Chinese
 agreed to all this in the Normalization and Taiwan Arms Sales
 Communiques.
 -- Nor does Zhao understand why the US believes that it is incompatible
 with friendly relations when Chinese public criticism of the US has
 the effect of supporting Soviet goals, as in Syria, Nicaragua, and
 INF deployments in Western Europe.  Zhao does not understand how
 negatively the US reacts to such criticism.
 -- Zhao probably does not realize that US officials noted the September
 visit of Peng Zhen, chairman of the Standing Committee of the
 National People's Congress, to the captured US intelligence ship
 "Pueblo" and his dockside statement that China and North Korea must
 fight against imperialism and hegemonism.
 -- Most important of all, Zhao will be impressed with authoritative
 explanations of how US officials react to continued Chinese public
 statements linking US and Soviet international behavior.  When Zhao
 denies in private that the Chinese make such linkage, he can be
 reminded that the linkage was restated by Foreign Minister Wu as
 recently as September before the U.N. ("the hegemonists' (the US and
 USSR) aggression against ...Third World countries have given rise to
 frequent wars and emergencies..."), and again by Hu in Tokyo in
 November ("As long as...China and Japan...are united, it is possible
 to prevent the hegemonists (the US and USSR) from throwing their
 weight around...).

 On the other hand, the Chinese undoubtedly hope for an unstated US
 recognition that domestic political factors in Beijing sometimes sharpen
 nationalistic rhetoric in Chinese foreign policy.  Since the substance of
 Chinese policy has remained generally unaffected in recent months at least and
 the US ability to influence outcomes in Beijing is low in any case, such
 recognition is mainly useful as a way of improving the atmosphere for
 discussions.
 Zhao probably expects American officials to reiterate their interest in a
 strategic relationship with China directed against the Soviet Union.  The
 Chinese have avoided discussions of a strategic relationship for several
 years.  Striving for the balancing catbird seat in the Washington-Beijing-
 Moscow relationship, uninterested at this juncture in strengthened strategic
 ties, they probably do not want to discuss a strategic relationship now.
 In any case, the Chinese do not believe that shared hostility towards the
 Soviet Union is the only cement binding Washington and Beijing together.
 the contrary, they expect economic, commercial, educational, scientific and
 technological and perhaps military ties to cement future relations, and will
 respond accordingly to American efforts to develop them.  Zhao and other
 senior leaders have repeatedly stressed the potential of these kinds of ties
 in meetings with influential Americans.
