 provide these moneys in time to aid the
 Peace Corps, We are not undertaking
 an easy task, but neither is the task of
 the Peace Corps volunteers easy.
 We can act today to continue their
 important work. Unless we act promptly,
 Peace Corps volunteers and staff may
 have to be released in the next few days.
 Only swift action can give them an 11th
 hour reprieve. I urge immediate consid-.
 oration of this legislation.
 Because counterpart funds owned by
 foreign governments may need to be
 supplemented by those in the possession
 of the United States, I am also drafting
 a bill which would authorize the Peace
 Cobs to use such currencies under the
 emergency circumstances outlined above.
 .-I have been in consultation with several
 of my colleagues, and find there is sub-
 stantial interest in pursuing this course
 of action. Mr. President, I assure. the
 Members of this body that I will pursue
 in every possible way a solution of the
 crisis faced by the Peace Corps.

 Representatives concurring), That it is the

 SENATE RESOLUTION 272-SUBMIS-
 MISSION OF A RESOLUTION EX-
 PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE
 SENATE RELATING TO SUPPORT
 OF RADIO FREE EUROPE AND
 RADIO LIBERTY
 Mr. PERCY. Mr. President, in recent
 weeks, differences between the House and
 Senate on the funding of Radio Free
 Europe and Radio Liberty have cast in
 doubt the future of these important
 radio stations which are the principal
 sources of free, uncensored, and rela-
 tively objective news in the countries of
 Eastern Europe.
 However, a majority of the Members of
 both Houses are clearly committed to
 support of these radio stations,.as indi-
 cated by the fact that both Houses have
 passed bills to this effect.
 Today, in an effort to demonstrate the
 broad support for continued funding of
 Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty,
 and to assure the 2,533 employees of
 these radio stations of our appreciation.
 for the valuable work they perform, the
 distinguished Senator from Minnesota
 (Mr. HUMPHREY) and I are submitting a
 sense-of-the-Senate  resolution  which
 reads as follows:    .
 S. REs. 272
 Expressing the some of the Senate with
 respect to the continued support of Radio
 Free Europe and Radio Liberty.
 Whereas Radio Free Europe and Radio
 Liberty- have prcovided an Important service
 to            the national interest in keeping open
 channels  of  information and opinion  on
 .matters of vital concern to, the peoples of
 the eastern part of Europe;
 Whereas  the  Senate  has appropriately
 taken the initiative during the past year to
 establish open and public means of govern-
 mental support for these two organizations;
 Whereas the Senate and the House of Rep-
 resentatives.ha,ve both passed bills authoriz-
 ing support of Radio Free Europe and Radio
 'Liberty,  and  American  editorial  opinion
 overwhelmingly favors this support;
 Whereas the Senate and the House of Rep-
 resentatives have not as yet agreed on the
 proper means of providing for the future
 operations of these two organizations; and
 Whereas the resulting failure to estab-
 lish a method of support has brought about
 a temporary cessation of support causing un-
 derstandable concern to the personnel of the
 two radios: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved, That the Senate hereby expresses
 (1) its continued appreciation of the valu-
 able work being performed by the personnel
 of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty and
 (2). its intention to provide adequate support
 to these two radios while the methods for
 future support are carefully examined with-
 in the framework of United States foreign
 policy objectives.
 Mr. PERCY. Mr. President, already we
 have been joined in cosponsorship of this
 resolution by Senators GOLDWATER, STAF-
 FORD, JAVITs, BROCK, GAMBRELL, BUCKLEY,
 PACKWOOD, DOLE, BAKER, BEALL, BROOKE,
 COTTON,  DOMINICK,  GRIFFIN,  GURNEY,
 HANSEN,  MILLER,  ROTH,  TOWER, EAST-
 LAND, PASTORE, BENNETT, MCGEE, RIBI-

 COOPER,  FANNIN,  FOND,  HATFIELD, MA-
 THIAS, STEVENS, JACKSON, BELLMON, MUS-
 KIE,  HART,  SCOTT,                                                           BENTSEN,  WILLIAMS,
 STEVENSON, Moss, TAFT, BAYH, McGov-
 ERN, CURTIS, THURMOND, KENNEDY, Me-
 INTYRE, HOLLINGS, and YOUNG.
 I would like to take the occasion of the
 introduction of this resolution to say that
 the terms "cold war" and "Iron Curtain"
 rightly belong to an earlier period, be-
 cause the processes of East-West nego-
 tiation,  exchanges  and  trade  have
 moderated the hostilities of the recent
 past. Consistent with the atmospheric
 change in East-West relationships, Radio
 Free Europe and Radio Liberty have
 moderated the tone of their broadcasts,
 and now it can be said that they are ded-
 icated to presenting the news in an ob-
 jective manner and to presenting com-
 mentary without vituperation or heavy
 handedness.
 But whether the terms "cold war" and
 "Iron Curtain" have any great signifi-
 cance in international relations at this
 time, they still are valid in respect to
 the conditions of life for many millions
 of persons who live in the Soviet Union
 and in the other countries of Eastern
 Europe. While a limited number of intel-
 lectuals and officials have the opportu-
 nity to travel abroad, and have access to
 Western publications and "White Tass,"
 which reprints topical reports from the
 foreign press, the vast majority of citi-
 zens have access only to that news per-
 mitted by the state to be printed or
 broadcast. Such control of the news
 media is not imposed for exercise; it is
 imposed for Its impact on the thinking
 of the broad masses of people. Appar-
 ently even in these times of reduced ten-
 sions between East and West, the rulers
 of the nations of Eastern Europe are not
 sufficiently self-confident in their power
 and popularity to allow a free, uncen-
 sored presentation of news to be printed
 and broadcast for public consumption.
 The astonishing management and con-
 trol of the media in the Soviet Union,
 for example, is seen in their media cover-
 age during last week's visit of President
 Nixon to China. This event, with all its,
 implications for the political future of
 Asia and its importance to the Soviet
 Union, received only half as much at-
 tention on Soviet radio as did the Greek-
 Cypriot issue which by any standard was
 hardly as, significant. Moreover, Soviet
 radio spent twice as much time in adverse
 comment about China as it did on report-
 age of the Nixon visit to China.
 Pravda devoted seven lines and Radio
 Moscow devoted 10 seconds to the an-
 nouncement of President Nixon's arrival
 in China. Later, Radio Moscow expended
 its coverage to 22 seconds, but balanced
 this with 20 seconds of negative reaction
 to the trip by the American Communist
 Party. President Nixon's meeting with
 Mao Tse-tung was accorded 20 seconds
 by Radio Moscow.
 Therefore, I believe it is fair to say that
 the cold war has not ended for the peo-
 ples of Eastern Europe, nor has the Iron
 Curtain been swept aside. The peoples of
 Eastern Europe still depend for hard
 news, for objective news, for total news
 on radio stations in the West,
 BBC and Voice of America do an im-
 portant job in this regard, but their
 credibility Is affected by the acknowl-
 edged fact that they are government-
 operated. Radio Free Europe and Radio
 Liberty, while receiving funds from the
 West, are known to be independent in
 their operations and presentations. So
 long as Radio Free Europe and Radio
 Liberty are needed to inform Eastern
 Europeans of the news, they should be
 supported. It is a sad fact that a man in
 Leningrad may not know of a major news
 event in Kiev or Prague or Paris or New
 York unless Radio Free Europe or Radio
 Liberty informs him. For no news, for-
 eigfl or domestic, is covered by the Soviet
 media unless It is officially approved for
 broadcast and print. State information
 policy is the determining factor in what
 the people are allowed to know.
 An example of the importance of the
 independent radio stations which broad-
 cast the news into Eastern Europe ap-
 peared in John P. Roche's column in the
 Washington Post of February 26, 1972.
 Mr. Roche reported the following story:
 A Soviet Jew signed a petition attacking
 the appalling Leningrad trials. Thirty years
 ago (said Roche)  he would have dropped
 this pebble down a bottomless well, but now,
 the next morning at 2:30, Radio Liberty was
 on the air with the text of the petition and
 the names of the signatories. This man, now
 in Israel, recalls the sense of triumph as he
 heard the broadcast: "They (the KGB) can
 take us now, but our testimony will stand
 in history."
 I am hopeful that the resolution which
 we submit today will be testimony to the
 determination of the U.S. Senate to sup-
