 China's US Policy,
 1983-90
 Key Judgments          In distancing themselves somewhat from the United States, reopening talks
 with the Soviet Union, and reviving emphasis on the Third World, the
 Chinese in 1981-82 reverted in fundamental respects to the position they
 had held before the postnormalization US-Chinese euphoria of 1979-80.
 Chinese rhetoric about the United States changed much more than the
 substance of US-Chinese relations. Movement toward an arms supply
 relationship between the two countries halted abruptly in the summer of
 1981, and the dispute over US arms sales to Taiwan required protracted
 and difficult negotiations in order to reach a compromise in August 1982.
 Other bilateral relationships, however, continued to grow, particularly
 those important to the Chinese goal of modernization, such as trade,
 scientific and technical cooperation, and scholarly exchange.
 The causes of the foreign policy change included:
 ? A growing feeling that China needed a more independent foreign policy,
 less closely aligned with the leading capitalist power.
 ? Disenchantment with the US connection over the Taiwan issue, the
 failure to obtain larger amounts of high technology, and an apparent US
 tendency to take China for granted.
 ? Conservative opposition to corrupting influences from the West, particu-
 larly from the United States.
 ? A desire to test Soviet willingness to ease tensions, with the expectation
 that opening talks would raise Moscow's hopes and Washington's
 anxieties, thus giving Beijing increased influence on both.
 ? Deng Xiaoping's vulnerability as chief sponsor of the US connection and
 his need for domestic support for his reform program and personnel
 changes, for making a compromise on the Taiwan issue, and for
 preserving the substance of relations with the United States important to
 modernization.
 If Deng remains healthy and vigorous during the coming two years, he
 probably will succeed in maintaining himself in power and strengthening
 the position of his associates. A Dengist regime would be more favorable to

 Approved For Release 2008/05/30: CIA-RDP86T00303R000300380014-5
 US interests than conceivable alternatives, because of Deng's identification
 with the US connection and his evident desire to preserve those elements of
 it important to China's modernization. Modest improvements in Sino-
 Soviet relations are likely, but a change in the Chinese perception of the
 Soviet Union as the main threat to China is improbable. Deep-seated
 suspicion of US long-run intentions toward Taiwan will persist and the
 Chinese will watch closely the level of US arms sales to Taiwan, but a
 Dengist regime is unlikely to press for additional US concessions on
 Taiwan within the next two years.
 In the period through 1990, the Chinese will continue to carve out an
 independent role for China. The Sino-Soviet relationship may have mel-
 lowed some, but China's geopolitical situation will almost certainly cause
 the Chinese to continue to regard the Soviets as the principal threat to their
 security. The gap in military capability between China and the super-
 powers will probably be wider than it is today. Under such circumstances,
 Chinese leaders will continue to value the putative strategic relationship
 with the United States, but will wish to avoid the fact or appearance of
 being too dependent on the United States.
 If Deng survives beyond the middle of the decade, he should be able to es-
 tablish his group firmly in control and by the end of the decade either Hu
 Yaobang or Zhao Ziyang will probably have emerged as the principal
 leader. Under Dengist leadership bilateral relations with the United States
 probably will expand substantially but unevenly. Expansion of relations
 will be hampered, however, by the built-in constraints that severely impede
 the Chinese leaders' efforts to instill the efficiency and dynamism needed
 to modernize a nation of 1 billion people. Should the Dengists be replaced
 by more ideological and inward-looking leaders, the expansion of US-
 Chinese relations would be much slower.
 The odds are high that the Chinese will bring pressure on the United States
 again before 1990 to end arms sales to Taiwan completely or at least get
 agreement to a date when they can be certain they will end. The
 importance to China of the US relationship may constrain the Chinese
 from pressing the issue to the point where they are forced to downgrade re-
 lations, but it would be unwise to assume that result, given the emotional
 content of the issue and its weight as a weapon in domestic politics. A crisis
 over Taiwan could be precipitated by a succession struggle on the island in
 which large numbers of Taiwanese demanded independence, an unlikely
 but possible development. Direct negotiations between Taipei and Beijing
 are unlikely during this period, but there will probably be an increase in
 trade and other forms of intercourse between the two that holds open the
 possibility of eventual unification and diminishes the risk that Beijing will
 shift from conciliatory to coercive policies toward the island.

 China's US Policy,
 1983-90
 Background
 Chinese policy toward the United States during the
 past 12 years went through three distinct phases: first,
 the prenormalization phase, 1971-78; second, the
 postnormalization euphoria, 1979-80; and, third, the
 reversion to a less euphoric view of US-Chinese
 relations, 1981-82. In each phase Chinese policy
 toward the United States was significantly affected by
 major international developments and by domestic
 political struggles. Common concern with Soviet ex-
 pansionism undergirded the relationship, while differ-
 ences over Taiwan-in 1982 still only partially re-
 solved-periodically strained it.
 Prenormalization, 1971-78. The opening to the Unit-
 ed States in 1971, engineered by Mao Zedong and
 Zhou Enlai, was a crucial step in China's reentry into
 the world community after a period of withdrawal
 marked by extreme Sinocentrism, xenophobia, and
 ideological posturing. China's entry into the United
 Nations and its establishment of diplomatic relations
 with Japan and many other countries greatly expand-
 ed the scope for China to be active on the world scene.
 Its policies became increasingly sophisticated and its
 diplomats increasingly skillful.
 The Soviet Threat. China's primary motivation in
 opening relations with the United States was to
 counter the Soviet threat after the Soviet occupation
 of Czechoslovakia and the clash with the Chinese on
 the Ussuri River, although the sense of Soviet forces
 as an imminent military threat soon declined; by 1973
 Chinese leaders referred to the Soviets as "feinting to
 the East in order to attack in the West."
 The two superpowers are the biggest international
 exploiters and oppressors of today. They are the source
 of a new world war. They both possess large numbers
 of nuclear weapons. They carry on a keenly contested
 arms race, station massive forces abroad and set up
 military bases everywhere, threatening the independ-
 ence and security of all nations.... In bullying others
 the superpower which flaunts the label of socialism is
 especially vicious.
 Deng Xiaoping speech to UN General Assembly, 10
 April 1974
 The "Three Worlds" Thesis. In a 1974 speech at the
 United Nations, Deng Xiaoping put forward Mao's
 "three worlds" thesis, categorizing the two superpow-
 ers as the "first world," the developed nations as the
 "second world," and all other countries, including
 China, as the "third world." According to this thesis,
 the two superpowers were "contending and colluding"
 and their contention (permanent, not transitory like
 collusion) was the main threat to peace. The Chinese
 characterized the Soviet Union as the more dangerous
 of the superpowers, being on the offensive, while the
 United States was on the defensive. They criticized
 the United States as insufficiently aware of the Soviet
 threat and too weak in dealing with it. They were
 particularly critical of the policy of detente and arms
 control negotiations between the superpowers. They
 spoke approvingly of NATO and the US-Japanese
 security treaty and stressed the importance.of com-
 mon opposition to Soviet expansionism.

 Political Turbulence. Domestic politics were turbu-
 lent during this period. Just two months after Henry
 Kissinger had visited Beijing in July 1971 to arrange
 the opening of US-Chinese relations, a fierce political
 struggle ended with the death of Lin Biao, Mao's
 chosen successor, accused of having tried to usurp
 power. Had Mao and Zhou been unable to overcome
 Lin and his military supporters, the opening to the
 United States probably would not have occurred. A
 seesaw struggle ensued between a group headed by
 Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping, representing rehabili-
 tated party leaders disgraced during the Cultural
 Revolution, and the Gang of Four, representing those
 who had risen to power over the prostrate bodies of
 the disgraced. This struggle was not resolved until
 after the death of Mao and the fall of the Gang of
 Four in the autumn of 1976. Deng emerged in 1977 as
 the most powerful political figure, but was still far
 from having fully consolidated his position when
 normalization was agreed upon in late 1978.
 Deng's Role in Normalization. During the negotia-
 tions leading to normalization, Deng was engaged in a
 complicated political maneuver to oust Hua Guofeng
 and other adversaries and place his chosen successors
 in key positions. He used success in normalizing
 relations with the United States to increase his politi-
 cal influence, thereby committing his personal pres-
 tige to the US connection and leaving himself vulner-
 able to later criticism for not having resolved the
 question of US arms sales to Taiwan at the time of
 normalization. Deng's ascendancy enabled him to win
 support for the normalization agreement and place his
 personal mark on the subsequent rapid development
 of US-Chinese relations, but opposition to too close an
 embrace of the United States had by no means
 disappeared.
 Taiwan Tactics. This period began and ended with
 compromises on the Taiwan issue, spelled out in the
 Shanghai communique in February 1972 and the
 communique on normalization of relations in Decem-
 ber 1978. Each time, the Chinese made clear that the
 compromise was only a step en route to their ultimate
 goal of unification of Taiwan with the mainland and
 served notice that further concessions would be de-
 manded of the United States on the issue.
 Postnormalization Euphoria, 1979-80. Normaliza-
 tion set off a wave of pro-Americanism in China,
 reciprocated by a "China fever" in the United States.
 Deng's highly acclaimed and publicized visit to the
 United States was followed by a stream of high-level
 visits back and forth. Relations of all kinds bur-
 geoned: trade, scholarly exchanges, tourism. The two
 governments signed numerous agreements providing
 for cooperation in a wide variety of fields. For months
 after Chinese television viewers had raptly watched
 Deng's visit, favorable articles about the United
 States appeared in the Chinese media. Young people
 were particularly enthusiastic and the number want-
 ing to go to the United States to study soared.
 Criticism was muted-for example, Chinese criticism
 of the Taiwan Relations Act and US criticism of the
 Chinese military "lesson" to Vietnam.
 The rapid development of Sino-American relations
 during this periood was reinforced by heightened
 strategic concerns on the part of both countries
 arising from Soviet support of Vietnam's invasion of
 Kampuchea in December 1978 and the Soviet inva-
 sion of Afghanistan a year later. The Chinese media
 and Chinese officials in private conversations stressed
 the importance of a united front against Soviet "hege-
 monism" among China, the United States, Japan,
 Western Europe, and the Third World. Media and
 private reference to the "three worlds" thesis and the
 danger of war from contention between the "two
 hegemonists," the United States and the Soviet
 Union, disappeared. Defense Secretary Harold Brown
 visited Beijing, and Vice Premier Geng Biao, secre-
 tary general of the Chinese Communist Party's Mili-
 tary Affairs Commission, visited Washington. The
 United States agreed to consider sales of dual-use
 technology and some types of nonlethal military sup-
 port equipment to Beijing.
 It is said that there are close relations between China
 and the United States. It is not true. We know very
 well that the United States is still an imperialist
 country.... Currently it is in a defensive position: it
 wishes to keep what it gained. The USSR is on the
 offensive.

 China regards as very important the development of
 relations with the United States, not just in the fight
 against Soviet expansionism and hegemonism, but be-
 cause the development of relations is important to
 world peace and stability.
 Zhao Ziyang to Japanese Prime Minister Suzuki,
 September 1982
 "Course Correction, " 1981-82. Beginning in 1981
 and becoming more pronounced during 1982, the
 Chinese foreign policy posture toward the United
 States and toward the world reverted in a number of
 respects to that which had prevailed during the mid-
 1970s. The reversion appeared in authoritative
 speeches, editorials and articles in the media, and
 private comments by senior leaders. The formulations
 varied over time and between individual spokesmen
 and were often more sophisticated in their analysis of
 world trends than in the mid-1970s. The principal
 elements of the revised foreign policy posture are
 discussed below.
 Revival of Mao's "Three Worlds" Thesis. Although
 not prominently featured in the full 1974 form, this
 conceptualization was occasionally referred to as the
 basis for Chinese foreign policy, and the most impor-
 tant elements of the new posture were consistent with
 it.
 Bracketing the United States With the Soviet Union
 as "the Two Hegemonists. " Hu Yaobang's speech to
 the 12th Party Congress in September 1982 attacked
 the rivalry of the two superpower "hegemonists" as
 the main source of turmoil in the world. Zhao Ziyang
 in his toast to Margaret Thatcher lumped the United
 States and the Soviet Union together as the "super-
 power hegemonists." Most articles and statements on
 this subject painted the Soviet Union in darker colors
 than the United States, but some dropped the line
 that the Soviet Union was the greater danger. None
 revived the earlier view that the superpowers were
 "colluding" as well as "contending." In private con-
 versations with US officials, Chinese officials have
 been defensive about the "two hegemonists" line and
 have stressed the danger of Soviet "hegemonism"-
 which, in their conversations with officials of nations
 friendly to the United States, they have also contin-
 ued to emphasize the need to oppose.
 Decline in Reference to Strategic Relationship With
 the United States. The trend toward a publicly ac-
 knowledged arms supply relationship with the United
 States that had been developing until the summer of
 1981 abruptly halted when the Chinese suspected that
 the United States hoped to ease pressures on the issue
 of arms sales to Taiwan by providing arms to China.
 By the summer of 1982 they had stopped referring
 publicly to the strategic relationship with the United
 States, although they referred to it privately in con-
 versations with countries friendly to the United
 States, often coupled with complaints about US policy
 on Taiwan and technology transfer.
 Strong Criticism of US "Hegemonism" Toward Tai-
 wan. From late 1980 on, Chinese concern over the
 Taiwan issue increased until it came to dominate US-
 Chinese relations during most of this period up to the
 joint communique of August 1982. The Chinese
 served notice that they will watch closely US perform-
 ance in reducing arms sales to Taiwan, as provided in
 that agreement.
 Continued Expansion of Bilateral Relations With the
 United States. The Chinese shift in posture toward
 the US role in the world and the US-Chinese strategic
 relationship has not affected the continued expansion
 of substantive bilateral relations. Those aspects of
 relationships with the United States important to the
 Chinese goal of modernization-such as trade, scien-
 tific and technical cooperation, and scholarly ex-
 change-have continued to grow. By late 1982 some
 10,000 Chinese were studying in the United States.
 Arrangements were proceeding for the involvement of
 US firms in large-scale offshore oil exploration, coal-
 mining, and hydroelectric power projects. The Chi-
 nese recently purchased seven additional Boeing com-
 mercial aircraft. Deng and others have said that these

 relations would continue, even if there were a retro-
 gression in the overall US-Chinese relationship be-
 cause of differences over Taiwan. With the expansion
 of relations, however, has come an increase in specific
 problems in these relations, with the Chinese com-
 plaining about US import controls, high-technology-
 export restrictions, and individual defection cases.
 Renewed Interest in Improving Relations With the
 Soviet Union. Talks that were broken off after the
 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan were reopened amid
 signs that the Chinese hoped to gain some practical
 advantages from a lessening of tensions, increased
 trade, and cultural and scholarly exchanges. Publicly
 they called on the Soviets for "deeds not words" with
 respect to the major issues of troops on the Chinese
 border, Vietnam, and Afghanistan, and privately they
 deprecated the prospects for any significant move-
 ment on these issues.
 Increased Emphasis on the Third World. Chinese
 analyses of world trends have described the Third
 World as the main arena of contention for the
 superpowers. The Chinese have increased their propa-
 ganda and diplomatic support for Third World. causes,
 but not their economic aid to Third World countries.
 While criticizing US policy toward the Third World,
 their main concern has continued to be Soviet influ-
 ence in the Third World, and they have followed
 policies parallel with those of the United States in
 opposing the Soviets in Afghanistan and Indochina.
 Reasons for the 1981-82 "Course Correction. "In
 large part the policy shift in 1981-82 seems to have
 been a rocking back to a position more comfortable to
 most Chinese leaders than the uncharacteristically
 close embrace of the world's leading capitalist power
 that prevailed in 1979-80. Sinocentrism and national
 pride demanded an independent foreign policy stance
 based on an evaluation of national interests that often
 diverged from those of the United States. Most
 Chinese regarded their dependence on the Soviet
 Union in the 1950s as having been humiliating and
 ultimately damaging to Chinese interests. From their
 viewpoint, overdependence on the United States
 would also be unwise. Third World countries were
 increasingly criticizing China for neglecting their
 interests by lining up with the United States.
 Disenchantment With the American Connection.
 Pressures for a foreign policy position more in harmo-
 ny with Chinese concepts of China's proper place in
 the world were augmented by irritation with the
 United States. Chinese leaders were stung by unoffi-
 cial American comments that China needed the Unit-
 ed States more than the United States needed China
 and that it had no place else to turn but to a strategic
 relationship with the United States. They did not
 want Americans to believe that they could take China
 for granted. Officials, including Deng himself, in-
 creasingly expressed disappointment with US-Chinese
 trade, especially the difficulty of obtaining high-
 technology items. Their disappointment seemed real,
 although doubtless exaggerated for effect in custom-
 ary Chinese negotiating style.
 The Taiwan Issue. While not the prime cause of
 China's foreign policy shift, the Taiwan issue contrib-
 uted substantially to it by increasing open criticism of
 US policy and disenchantment with the American
 connection. The highlighting of the FX question
 toward the end of the Carter administration and pro-
 Taiwan statements by highly placed Americans prob-
 ably triggered the Chinese decision that the dispute
 over arms sales to Taiwan, unresolved and defined in
 deliberately ambiguous terms at the time of the
 agreement on normalization, could no longer be left
 dangling. Once the arms sales issue had become
 highly visible, Taiwan could not be placed on the back
 burner again without significant US concessions.
 "Bourgeois Influence."The opening to the West, and
 to the United States in particular, disturbed conserva-
 tive leaders who felt that it brought into China
 corrosive influences that caused an increase in corrup-
 tion, the spread of a "decadent" lifestyle among the
 youth, and a general decline in faith in Marxism and
 in the party. They demanded a campaign against
 "bourgeois liberalism" to combat these evils.
 Deng 's Problems. These developments placed Deng
 Xiaoping in a difficult position. As chief sponsor of
 the American connection, he was vulnerable to critics
 of that connection. He was engaged in a complex and
 Approved For Release 2008/05/30: CIA-RDP86T00303R000300380014-5
 Approved For Release 2008/05/30: CIA-RDP86T00303R000300380014-5
 difficult set of political maneuvers to overcome oppo-
 sition to his reform measures and place his supporters
 in key positions throughout the party and government.
 He also recognized the need to maintain the substance
 of the bilateral relations with the United States
 because of their importance to his modernization
 goals. He needed concessions from the United States
 on the Taiwan issue in order both to quiet his critics
 and to avoid jeopardizing substantive relations with
 the United States.
 Testing the Soviets. As doubts about the American
 connection increased among the leaders, conditions
 ripened for an effort to ease tensions with the Soviet
 Union. The Soviets were harried by problems in
 Poland and Afghanistan, plagued with economic diffi-
 culties, and approaching a leadership succession. They
 probably seemed to the Chinese less threatening and
 more likely to make concessions than in the past. At
 the very least, responding to Soviet overtures would
 put some strain on Soviet-Vietnamese relations and
 show the Americans that China was not to be taken
 for granted. Moreover, recent US policy had dis-
 played a thoroughgoing anti-Soviet attitude and little
 taste for detente. Talks between Moscow and Beijing
 were unlikely to make the United States less deter-
 mined to oppose Soviet expansionism in places where
 such actions coincided with Chinese interests. The
 Chinese could afford to take US anti-Sovietism for
 granted. By raising Moscow's hopes and Washing-
 ton's anxieties, Beijing could gain greater influence on
 both.
 Deng's Victory. In the end Deng achieved much of
 what he wanted: he obtained some of the flexibility
 needed from the United States on Taiwan; he
 strengthened the positions of his supporters in the
 party and government, although he had to make
 compromises on policy and positions to do so; he
 turned aside the criticisms of the corrupting influ-
 ences of the West by himself backing the campaign
 against "bourgeois liberalism"; and he averted dam-
 age to the bilateral relations with the United States
 important to modernization.
 States has changed, while the substance of the rela-
 tionship-with the exception of the suspended arms
 supply discussions-has been preserved. Some evi-
 dence exists that Deng may have made concessions on
 rhetoric to preserve the substance, but it is by no
 means certain that Deng is opposed to the reposition-
 ing of China in world affairs: in rhetoric, in opening
 talks with the Soviet Union, or in emphasis on the
 Third World. The shift could be viewed as a typical
 Dengist pragmatic response to trends in world affairs
 that gives China greater leverage on both the Soviet
 Union and the United States and places Deng in a
 better position to draw on the powerful force of
 Chinese nationalism to bolster his position and that of
 his chosen successors in the continuing domestic
 political maneuvering.
 The Future-Two-Year Projection
 Leadership. The prospects for stable development of
 US-Chinese relations in 1983 and 1984 would be best
 under the continued leadership of Deng Xiaoping,
 even though the lengthy negotiations and serious
 differences over Taiwan seem to have produced per-
 sonal distrust on his part of the US Government.
 Nevertheless, his identification with the US connec-
 tion and his evident desire to preserve those elements
 of it most important to China's modernization pro-
 gram provide some assurance that US-Chinese rela-
 tions would fare reasonably well, provided he and his
 associates maintained or strengthened their ascendan-
 cy in the political system.
 Pragmatic Policies. Dengist policies such as greater
 reliance on market forces and material incentives, the
 expansion of foreign trade, the encouragement of
 foreign investment, the invitation to US oil companies
 to develop Chinese offshore oil, the training of large
 numbers of scholars and students in the United
 States, and the carrying out of a wide variety of
 scientific and technological cooperation arrangements
 seem more likely to advance US-Chinese relations
 than policies that would be chosen by possible alterna-
 tive leaders.
 The foreign policy shift of 1981-82 is notable for the
 extent to which the rhetoric used about the United

 Approved For Release 2008/05/30: CIA-RDP86T00303R000300380014-5
 Deng's Prospects. If Deng remains healthy and vigor-
 ous over the next two years, he probably will succeed
 in maintaining himself in power and strengthening the
 positions of his associates. Deng's death during this
 period, however, would create great uncertainty and a
 probable power struggle, for Hu and Zhao would not
 by then be sufficiently entrenched to be unchallenge-
 able. During such a power struggle, Chinese foreign
 policy would be less predictable and US-Chinese
 relations might become an issue in the struggle. In
 any case, the instability and uncertainty would hinder
 the smooth expansion of those relations.
 Geopolitical Interests. Whether or not Deng and his
 associates remain in ascendancy, the Chinese percep-
 tion that the Soviet Union is the main threat to China
 is unlikely to change. A dramatic rapprochement
 during this period is most improbable, because of the
 intractability of basic differences, but the Chinese
 have positioned themselves to gain greater leverage in
 the US-Chinese-Soviet triangular relationship by
 moderating their policy toward Moscow and distanc-
 ing themselves somewhat from Washington. They will
 follow a two-track policy toward the Soviet Union and
 the United States, criticizing each harshly for policies
 with which the Chinese disagree, but promoting those
 bilateral relationships that promise to benefit China.
 Rhetorical inconsistencies will also occur, as illustrat-
 ed by the conciliatory gestures made to Moscow on
 the 60th anniversary of the USSR, promptly followed
 by a strident denunciation of the Soviet occupation of
 Afghanistan. Barring any new aggressive action by
 the Soviet Union, the outlook is for modest improve-
 ment in the atmosphere between Beijing and Moscow
 and in bilateral interchange, far below the level
 prevailing in Chinese relations with the United States,
 Japan, and Western Europe. While not highlighting
 China's strategic interests in common with these
 countries in opposing Soviet expansionism as they did
 in 1979-80, the Chinese probably will continue selec-
 tively and privately to stress the importance of such
 strategic cooperation.
 Military Modernization. Recent indications that the
 Chinese are placing increased emphasis on military
 modernization, such as the contract with the British
 to modernize Chinese destroyers and increased inter-
 est in French weapon systems, probably do not pre-
 sage an early revived interest in obtaining US weap-
 ons. The Chinese will hold off while watching the
 trend of US arms sales to Taiwan. In any case, they
 are more interested in creating a capability to produce
 their own modern weapons than in acquiring weapon
 systems from abroad. Consequently, they can be
 expected to continue and perhaps to increase their
 pressure on the United States to loosen further the
 restrictions on technology export, so that they can
 obtain the "dual use" technology most urgently need-
 ed for modernizing their military production.
 Bilateral Relations. Over the next two years the web
 of relations between the two countries probably will
 continue to thicken, particularly if economic recovery
 in the United States by 1984 offers China an expand-
 ing market for its exports. More specific problems will
 crop up, however, as relations expand and some may
 create significant strains in the relationship. Substan-
 tial numbers of defections by government-supported
 students or scholars in this country, for example,
 would create strong suspicions on the part of Chinese
 leaders that the US Government was clandestinely
 encouraging them, especially if many requested politi-
 cal asylum and were assisted by Taiwan-connected
 individuals. An appeal for political asylum by one or
 more of the children of senior Chinese political lead-
 ers would strain relations, particularly if they or other
 defectors joined groups promoting democracy in Chi-
 na, such as the backers of the magazine China Spring.
 Why Deng made a personal appeal to the US Govern-
 ment to return defecting tennis star Hu Na is unclear,
 but the failure of his appeal cannot help but create

 Secret
 greater suspicion in his mind that such defections are
 officially encouraged.
 The Future-Eight-Year Projection
 The 1979-80 honeymoon in US-Chinese relations has
 passed and will not return. The exaggerated expecta-
 We hope that the US Government will sincerely carry
 out what it has promised and actually, not perfunctori-
 ly, reduce its arms sales to Taiwan.... The fundamen-
 tal obstacle to the development of Sino-US relations is
 the US "Taiwan Relations Act...... If the decision-
 makers in Washington insist on handling the relations
 between both countries in accordance with this US
 domestic act, Sino-US relations, instead of being fur-
 ther developed, will certainly face yet another grave
 crisis.
 Taiwan. Taiwan will remain the primary obstacle to
 improvement in US-Chinese relations. Deep-seated
 suspicions of US long-run intentions toward Taiwan
 will persist. In addition to watching closely the trend
 in US arms sales, Chinese leaders will be highly
 sensitive to any action, however insignificant in itself,
 that appears to them to lend an official air to US-
 Taiwan relations.
 A Dengist regime is less likely to press for more
 concessions on Taiwan during this period than an
 alternative, although a Chinese perception that the
 United States was not abiding by the commitment to
 reduce the level of arms sales to Taiwan would
 produce strong reactions. An attempt to make Taiwan
 an issue in the 1984 US presidential election cannot
 be ruled out, but it seems unlikely that Deng would
 seek another test of strength with the present adminis-
 tration by pressing for more US concessions within
 the next two years.
 The sudden death of Chiang Ching-kuo could produce
 a succession crisis in Taiwan, new initiatives from
 Beijing on the unification question, and heightened
 tension between China and the United States on the
 Taiwan issue. If Chiang remains in power through the
 two-year period of this projection, however, domestic
 developments in Taiwan are unlikely to complicate
 US-Chinese relations.
 tions and muting of differences that marked that
 period will be replaced during the 1983-90 period by a
 hard-eyed (although not necessarily accurate) assess-
 ment of national interests on each side and much
 tough bargaining. The range of possible improvement
 or deterioration in the relationship is substantial and
 the trend difficult to predict, but certain constants
 will persist.
 While we Chinese people value our friendship and
 cooperation with other countries and people, we value
 even more our hard-won independence and sovereign
 rights. No foreign country can expect China to be its
 vassal, nor can it expect China to swallow any bitter
 fruit detrimental to China's interests.
 Deng Xiaoping speech to 12th Party Congress,
 1 September 1982
 Chinese World View. Whatever the nature of their
 leadership, the Chinese will maintain a highly Sino-
 centric view of the world, and Chinese nationalism
 will strongly influence their behavior as they strive to
 achieve an international role for China worthy of its
 size and past greatness. They probably will continue
 to see world politics as dominated by superpower
 rivalry, but with a further decline in the ability of the
 superpowers to influence or dominate other countries.
 Their relations with each superpower will contain
 contradictions. Chinese diplomacy is likely to become
 more skillful and sophisticated as China's leaders
 become more experienced in managing such contra-
 dictions and advancing Chinese interests from an
 independent stance.
 The US-Chinese-Soviet Triangle. In 1990, China will
 still be much weaker militarily than the Soviet Union
 or the United States; indeed, the accelerated arms
 race, even if checked in some areas by arms control
 agreements, will probably widen the gap between

 Approved For Release 2008/05/30: CIA-RDP86T00303R000300380014-5
 Chinese military capability and that of the superpow-
 ers. China's geopolitical situation will almost certainly
 cause Chinese leaders to continue to regard the
 Soviets as the principal threat, although relations with
 the Soviets may have mellowed and some progress
 may have been made toward solution of the Afghani-
 stan and Kampuchea problems.
 Under such circumstances Chinese leaders will con-
 tinue to value the putative strategic relationship with
 the United States and its allies-Japan and the
 NATO countries. They will want to avoid, however,
 either the fact or the appearance of being too depend-
 ent on the United States strategically. How far they
 will wish to pursue the relationship will depend on a
 number of factors: the imminence of the Soviet threat,
 the consistency and reliability of US opposition to
 Soviet expansionism, US willingness to contribute to
 Chinese military capabilities by supplying technology,
 and the state of the Taiwan issue. Changes in the
 nature of the Chinese leadership could also affect
 attitudes toward a strategic relationship with the
 United States. More ideologically inclined and in-
 ward-looking leaders than the Dengists would tend to
 keep China more distant from the United States,
 although they would not draw closer to the Soviets
 either.
 Bilateral Relations. If Deng survives beyond the
 middle of the decade as China's predominant political
 figure, he should have time to establish his group
 firmly in control. In that event, either Hu or Zhao
 probably will emerge as the new leader by the end of
 the decade. As discussed in the two-year projection,
 US-Chinese relations will develop further under such
 leadership than under less pragmatic, less outward-
 looking leaders.
 Under a Dengist leadership, US-Chinese bilateral
 relations important to Chinese modernization-trade,
 investment, technology transfer, scientific and techni-
 cal cooperation, and training of scholars and students
 in the United States-will continue to expand, proba-
 bly substantially by the end of the decade, but
 unevenly. Expansion of US-Chinese relations will be
 hampered by the built-in constraints that severely
 impede the Chinese leaders' efforts to instill the
 efficiency and dynamism needed to modernize a
 nation of 1 billion people. Such constraints include:
 ? The difficulty of energizing China's lethargic and
 ponderous bureaucracy.
 ? Constantly shifting economic policies, as leaders
 argue about and experiment with methods of arriv-
 ing at the proper balance between administrative
 controls and market forces, centralization and de-
 centralization, military and civilian expenditures,
 and investment in heavy industry, light industry,
 and agriculture.
 ? Continuing pressures to limit contacts with foreign-
 ers and the influx of foreign influences, to make
 China more self-reliant.
 ? Widespread cynicism, lack of confidence in the
 party, and the spread of corruption and resort to
 "backdoor" deals.
 Progress probably will be made, but at a pace slower
 than plans call for-which will hold back the expan-
 sion of US-Chinese bilateral relations. Pockets may
 exist-for example, in offshore oil production-where
 the bilateral relationship expands much further than
 in other areas. To the extent that particular areas of
 bilateral relations expand, however, more concrete
 problems will arise, and these, if handled insensitively,
 will sour the tone of the relationship.
 Taiwan. Chinese spokesmen are fond of referring to
 the Taiwan issue as "a cloud over the US-Chinese
 relationship." The cloud may become darker or
 lighter during the coming eight years, but it will not
 go away. It will continue to be the critical issue that
 must be contained if it is not to damage the
 relationship.
 On three previous occasions China has reached a
 compromise with the United States on Taiwan, each

 Secret
 time retreating from its maximum demands in order
 to reach agreement, but serving notice that further
 US concessions would be demanded in the future. The
 odds are high that the Chinese will bring pressure on
 the United States again before eight years are out in
 an effort to end US arms sales to Taiwan completely
 or at least to get agreement to a date when Beijing
 can be certain they will end.
 Constraints on Pressing Taiwan Issue. Several factors
 constrain the Chinese from pushing the Taiwan issue
 to the point where they must downgrade relations
 with the United States because of failure to reach
 agreement. The importance of the strategic relation-
 ship as a counter to the Soviet threat would be
 weakened; bilateral relations important to Chinese
 modernization might be impaired, despite efforts to
 insulate them from the effects of the Taiwan dispute;
 and, to the extent that Americans became disenchant-
 ed with the Chinese relationship, support for an
 independent Taiwan might grow.
 Motivations for Pressing Taiwan Issue. Yet it would
 be a mistake to assume that these constraints will
 necessarily be decisive to Chinese leaders, who feel
 that they are morally and legally in the right on the
 Taiwan issue and that they have broad support
 around the world. They are suspicious that the United
 States, despite its promise to respect Chinese sover-
 eignty, is in fact disregarding it in its desire to keep
 Taiwan separate from China and they believe that the
 arms supply relationship encourages the Taiwan au-
 thorities to reject negotiations with Beijing. It is a
 frustrating situation, because they know that it is
 impractical to use force against Taiwan. The emotion-
 al content of the issue and its effectiveness as a
 weapon in Chinese domestic politics can add to
 pressures to retaliate against the United States de-
 spite the cost to Chinese interests. The Chinese broke
 with the Soviet Union in 1960 over offenses to their
 national pride, despite the severe damage it did to
 their economic development and military moderniza-
 tion and in the face of a dangerous level of confronta-
 tion with the United States.
 Taiwan's Policies. A crisis over Taiwan might arise
 without being provoked by Beijing's pressures if a
 political struggle in Taiwan over the succession took a
 turn in which large numbers of Taiwanese demanded
 a declaration of independence. The principal leaders
 in Taiwan today, both mainlander and Taiwanese, are
 sensitive to that danger and probably will succeed in
 averting it, but it cannot be ruled out altogether.
 The danger of a crisis over Taiwan between the
 United States and China will be lessened if the island
 remains politically stable through the period of transi-
 tion from mainlander leaders to native Taiwanese,
 which probably will be only partially complete within
 the coming eight years. Whether or not the United
 States makes further concessions on arms sales during
 the period, the authorities on Taiwan are unlikely to
 be willing to negotiate directly with Beijing on the
 unification issue. Increases in trade and other forms
 of intercourse between Taiwan and the mainland that
 seemed to the Beijing leaders to demonstrate firm
 adherence to the one-China position and held open the
 possibility of eventual unification would diminish the
 risk that Beijing would take strong actions against the
 United States on the Taiwan issue or shift from
 conciliatory to coercive policies toward Taiwan itself.
