 "suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries" in Communist China -- Page 1
 . The Peiping regime has admitted the execution of more  than
 5O,OO0 "counter-revolutionaries," but the true total is probably
 many times higher.  The current campaign, indicating the leader-
 ship's confidence in the security of its position, aims at the
 systematic intimidation of the populace as a whole.  The campaign
 is expected to be a permanent feature of China's "new democracy,"
 and to claim several million victims in the next few years.

 More than 500,000 people-mat least one out of every thousand
 Chinese-?have been executed in less than six months of the campaign
 against "counter-revolutionaries" launched by the Peiping regime in Feb-
 ruary in an effort to intimidate the Chinese people.                       The toll may well
 reach one million by the end of 1951.
 The unprecedented publicity given the campaign leaves little doubt
 that it was aimed at the people themselves, rather than at dissident
 groups.  The Communist press and radio now admit that 50,000 "hostiles"
 h'ave-been liquidated, but their figures cover only certain cities, whereas
 the campaign has been nationwide and has probably struck hardest at the
 countryside, where four-fifths of China?s people live.
 The "Regulations Governing the Punishment of Counter Revolutionaries,"
 published over the signature of Mao Tse-tung in February, were the signal
 for a great expansion of official terrorism.  Such a development was pre-
 dicted and authorized by Mao as early as July 1949, when, in his exegesis
 of the "people?s democratic dictatorship," he asserted the need for "sup-
 pressing counter-revolutionary and reactionary elements of all types."
 The Common Program adopted by the People?s Consultative Conference,
 which set Up the Peiping regime in autumn 1949, called upon the new govern-
 ment to suppress all counter-revolutionary activities, i.e., any activities
 which the regime's leaders might choose to regard as indicating opposition.
 The February 1951 regulations specify the death penalty for such crimes as
 subversion of officials, instigation of armed insurrection, espionage and
 sabotage, and for such offenses as currency manipulation, dissemination of
 rumors, and attempting to leave the country.  Subsequent Communist state-
 ments are frank in admitting that a "counterrevolutionary" is any person
 regarded as "hostile to the people," which, in Communist parlance, means
 anyone opposed to the regime.
 The "suppression of counter-revolutionaries" campaign is largely
 distinct from the "bandit-suppression" campaign--in which Peiping claims
 .to have liquidated more than one million anti-Communist guerrillas--and
 from such other operations aiming at the consolidation of Stalinist con-
 trol as the current pruges of the Chinese Communist Party and the puppet
 parties associated with it in the regime.  While bandit leaders and cer-
 tain Communist and puppet party figures qualify as "counter-revolution-
 ariea,a the current campaign is directed not against any particular group
 or groups but against the Chinese people as a whole.
 Strictly speaking, the current campaign is not a security operation.
 Contrary to widespread speculation that the campaign was an ate; b2g measure
 designed to deal with increased anti-State activities, the campaign in
 fact has increased in direct proportion to the stability of the regime.

 The present campaign was launched only after the Peiping regime was
 firmly in. control of the country, and the campaign is evidence not of
 the regimens weakness but of its strength.
 During the period of extension and early consolidation of Communist
 control in China, the Communist leadership adopted a lenient and concilia-
 tory policy toward opposition elements.  By the end of 1950, however,, the
 leadership was in a sufficiently secure position to proceed with the next
 stage in the standard operating procedure of a Communist revolution,, the
 suppression of actual and suspected opposition and the systematic intimi-
 dation of the populace as a whole.
 There are indications that the 'suppression of counterrevolutionaries"
 campaign has passed its high point, and that the most easily identified op-
 ponenta of the regime have been eliminated.  Whereas Communist figures
 earlier in 1951 indicated that about half of those arrested were executed,
 in recent weeks the percentage of those executed is much lower, with the
 majority receiving sentences of hard labor. Nevertheless, thousands of
 persons are still arrested daily, and public statements emphasize that the
 campaign must continue indefinitely.
 One Communist spokesman, who declared that the purge must go on so
 long as external enemies of the regime exist, came close to admitting the
 truth.  Continuous and officially-incited persecution of actual and alleged
 opposition elements is an essential part of the operation of a Communist
 state.  The ' "suppression of counter-'revolutionaries,," campaign is certain to
 be a permanent feature of China's "new democracy," and several millions of
 Chinese are expected' to fall victim to it in the next few yeaars,

 Britain See%s Middle East Defense Pacte
 Britain is now trying to create an international defense organization
 for the Middle East as a means of augmenting the limited UK resources for
 the protection of.the area, without relinquishing its traditional paramount
 position.  As proposed by British Foreign Secretary Morrison to Turkey
 early in July, the organization would take the form of an integrated allied
 command headquarters  similar to SHAPE,, and initially composed of Turkey,
 France, the USA and Great Britain,
 This headquarters would in effect be an extension of present British
 arrangements in the Middle East, and would probably be commanded by a
 British officer,  Later phases in its development would bring in South Africa
 Australia,, New Zealand, And, it is hoped, Egypt.  Britain has also indicated
 a desire for the eventual participation of certain other Arab States ard
 Israel, should their bitter rivalries permit.
 Such an arrangement,, Britain hopes, would realize the long-sought goal
 of a stable regional defense combination for the Middle East, the area which
 to the UK is strategically only less vital than the home defense zone of
 Western Europe.  The British see the basic problem in the Middle East as
 markedly different from that of the home defense zone in that a number of
 the powers with vital Middle East strategic interests are located thousands
 of miles away, and have few economic or cultural ties with the area.
 British officials therefore wish to restrict the negotiations for any
 Middle East combination entirely to military questions, and to avoid the
 delicate political issues which would arise in any effort to secure a
 broader"association of the states interested in.the area,  They also hope
 that a multilateral approach will surmount the obstacles of anti-British
 sentiment. and local rivalries which have persistently handicapped indepen-
 dent UK efforts,.
 Thus, Britain hopes that a; Middle East joint headquarters could find
 some way to reach an agreement with Egypt on the vital problems of the de-
 fense of Suez and of rights to bases,  The present defense set-up, in the
 light of the controversy over the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, is forced to oper-
 ate under high unsatisfactory political conditions.  The proposed organiza-
 tion would at the same time offer a means of integrating Commonwealth con-
 tributions to the defense of Middle East, which Britain regards as vital
 to the preservation of the Commonwealth as a political entity.
 The late June conference of Commonwealth Defense Ministers in London
 concentrated 6h this question, and the UK was able to persuade South Africa
 to reaffirm a .t;ommitment to join in measures concerning the Middle East,
 and apparently made some progress in persuading Australia that its vital
 interests are still.involved in the Middle East, as well as in the Pacific.
 The relationship between the proposed organization and NATO would be
 loose, since the former would eventually include several states not members

 of the Atlantic Council, and since NATO might view with suspicion any
 move which appeared to broaden the geographical extent of its security
 commitrnts.  However., a measure of coordination would be insured through
 the dual membership of three key powers and through overlapping British
 commands in the Middle East and the Eastern Mediterranean.
 Britain has launched its effort to develop a new theater of allied
 joint operations in the Middle East coincidentally with discussion of the
 US proposal to admit Greece and Turkey to NATO., and at a time when British
 prestige in the Middle East is at a low ebb.  The British proposal is thus
 timed to gain the adherence of Turkey in return for British support of the
 Turkish claim to enter NATO, and to engage the support of the US as a logi-
 cal development of the US position on the strategic importance of Turkeys
 Meanwhile, .however, Britain has served notice of her intention to maintain
 a paramount position in the Middle East by steadfastly insisting upon a
 separate Eastern Mediterranean naval command under NATO$ with a, British
 officer at its head4

 The Economic: Significance of Eastern Euro:e to the USSR.
 The European Satellites are making a significant contribution to the
 economic war potential of Soviet Russia.  Their value to the USSR is in-
 creasing as;plafned goals for industrial development are attained, as the
 various segments of the economies become more integrated, and as ship-
 ments to the Soviet Union grow in volume.
 The USSR obtains from the Satellite countries goods,services, and
 technicians, and in addition it utilizes Satellite transportation facili-
 .ties.  Among the most important goods supplied by the Satellites are
 chemicals, fabricated steel products., uranium, petroleum, coal and in-
 dustrial equipment.  Approximately 50 per cent of the total annual pro-
 duction of the engineering industries of East Germany, Czechoslovakia,
 Hungary and Poland is exported to the USSR.  In 1950 the Satellites, led
 by Eastern Germany, supplied about two-thirds of the uranium ore and
 concentrates produced in the Soviet bloc.
 Soviet formulation and direction of Satellite planning, implemented
 largely through the Council of Economic Mutual Assistance, constitute the
 most important means by which the USSR assures an increasing contribu-
 tion to its war potential from these countries.  By promoting speciali-
 zation of production, increasing trade between the various Satellites in
 items so produced, making the various economies dependent on the USSR for
 essential materials and markets, and discouraging trade with the West,
 both Soviet economic domination and the Soviet military-economic potent-
 ial are strengthened.
 Through national and regional plans., the USSR sets annual and long-
 term production schedules and dictates the categories and quantities of
 goods to be produced by the Satellites.  Coordination of plans at all
 levels and their integration into the Russian economic program are
 assured by Soviet allocation of materials to implement production
 schedules and by the direct participation of Soviet personnel in Satellite
 economic activities.  This control pattern has been increasingly ap-
 parent since 1948, when the Soviet Union sharply modified its policy to-
 ward the Satellites from one of looting and short-term exploitation to
 one of building up the economy of the area as a whole in order to obtain
 long-term benefits.
 Under Soviet direction, an increasing portion of the national in-
 come of the Satellites is being allocated to capital investment.  In
 Czechoslovakia over 40 per cent of the national investment projected in
 the Five-Year Plan is to be in industry.  The planned rate of industrial
 development is approximately uniform throughout the Satellite area, but
 Albania, Bulgaria and Rumania have. been unsuccessful in meeting Plan
 goals for industrialization.  East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Poland,,,
 on the other hand, are rapidly expanding and coordinating their industri-
 al capacity into an Eastern European "Ruhr."  Polish industry, for ex-
 ample, is to account for 60 per cent of the national income in 1955.

 Soviet domination of Satellite finance and foreign trade permits the
 Satellites to import, from the USSR, or wherever the USSR may direct,
 the,capital goods and raw materials necessary for industrialization.  The
 industries developed, however, are those that can contribute most to
 Soviet war material,
 The Satellite area has a number of economic drawbacks limiting its
 usefulness to the USSR.  Such important raw materials as iron ore, cop-
 per, lead, zinc, tin, cotton, wool and rubber are largely unavailable
 locally.  The USSR, because of its own needs, is not providing the
 Satellites with industrial materials and equipment in sufficient volume
 to develop a broad industrial base.  The stress on heavy industry is re-
 sulting in a lack of consumer goods, low living standards, inflation
 and'widespread popular discontent.
 The Satellite area is vulnerable to Western economic measures be-
 cause of the attempt to industrialize at an accelerated rate in the face
 of serious deficiencies of raw materials, capital, equipments and
 technical and managerial skills,  This industrialization program has,
 therefore, greatly increased dependence on Western imports, as may be
 seen in the concerted Satellite effort to obtain from the West, legally
 or otherwise, materials and ecsiipment that are in short supply in the
 Orbit,

 Free World Reaction to Draft Japanese Treaty
 The "conciliatory" draft peace treaty for Japan. published on 12
 July by its sponsers,'Britain and the United States, brought reactions
 which ranged from the violent and angry opposition of the Philippines
 to the apathy of Latin America,,
 ,Opposition to the ' treaty,, where it existed.,arose from the draft's
 failure to demand heavy Japanese reparations, and from the fear that-
 it did not provide adequately against future Japanese aggression.
 Despite the initial reservations of several nations, a more objective
 viewpoint seems to be emerging-the sole exception being the Philippines,
 where feeling still runs high.  It seems likely that all. t6 non-Communist
 nations invited to the conference in San Francisco on 4 September will
 attend, although the presence of Burma, India and the Philippines is
 still uncertain.
 The Communist Orbit, as expected, let forth a vitriolic stream of
 denunciation, probably aimed at intimidating the Asiatic nations, and
 endlessly repeated the familiar charges that the treaty was illegal and
 that it was designed to turn Japan into a base for US aggression.
 'Reaction., both official and unofficial., among certain non-Communist
 nations was as follows:
 Japan
 The press generally considered the treaty fair and devoid of harsh
 terms, a feeling possibly based on relief over the lack of restrictive
 industrial provisions and at the prospects of an early, treaty.  Unanimous
 regret, however, was expressed over the loss of the tthistorically
 Japanese" islands., the Kuriles, 1pukyus, and Bonins._ Opposition politi-
 cal parties are already exploiting this loss, the only provision which
 might generate anti-US feeling in the post-treaty period.  Some disappoint-
 ment also was'expressed over the inclusion of a limited reparations clause,
 and a latent concern has been expressed that the treaty might alienate
 some Asiatic nations on whom Japan depends for much.of its trade.
 The British Commonwealth
 In the UK., most editorial comment has been relatively factual and
 without strong bias,  Textile and commercial interests;, however, are
 disturbed over the alleged lack of safeguards against unfair Japanese
 competition.  The government in general has no serious reservations
 concerning the substantive content of the draft, but probably remains
 sceptical of the wisdom of the procedural compromises over the Chinese
 accession problem.  The treaty draft leaves it to Japan to decide-with
 which Chinese government it will sign a collateral treaty.,,.  The Atlee

 government has already been severely criticized by both Labor and Con-
 servative Members of Parliament for following too closely the US line
 in the treaty negotiations, and for allegedly ignoring the Peiping
 Government .
 25X1
 Conclusion of the US-New ZealandAustralia security pact removed the
 greatest concern of these nations in respect to Japan-fear of Japan's
 military resurgence.  Consequently, the majority -editorial comment
 following the draft treaty's publication indicated that, while the terms
 are too favorable for Japan., a soft treaty was inevitable under present
 cira mstancesn  This objective view was shared generally by Government
 leaders.  Canadian reaction generally has been similar, and the press
 credits the US with a "far-sighted" and "sincere" effort to return Japan
 to the community of nations,
 The non-Communist press gave the draft treaty full coverage, in .  .
 most cases adding no comment, although a few papers expressed disappoint-
 ment that the Indochinese states were excluded or held reservations
 regarding the economic clauses..  The French Goverment has officially
 expressed concern over the effect of the Associated States1 exclusion
 upon the Indochinese and French troops now fighting the Communists.
 Its
 Italy's exclusion from the Japanese peace treaty has caused a "crushing
 reaction" among Foreign Office officials, who are particularly embittered
 and.hmiliated by its leniency,, in contrast to the comparatively harsh
 terms of the Italian peace treaty.  These officials assert that the
 public relegation of Italy to a position of inferiority will make Italian
 negotiations with Japan more difficult.  The complete lack of press
 comment suggests that the Italian public in general is not much disturbed
 over the development.  Italy presently is inclined to'end its state of
 war with Japan through a simple bilateral declaration.
 The Philippines
 Publication of the treaty in the Philippines, where anti-Japanese
 sentiment still remains strong, provoked a series of angry protests and
 demonstrations against the US, centering around the treaty's lack of
 provision for specific reparations payments.  Both the press and the
 Government expressed unanimous disapproval of the drafts the Foreign
 Minister threatened to resign, and President:a.irino stated categorically

 thatth.e Philippines would not sign the treaty in its present form.
 The Government, which is partially responsible for the situation
 because of its efforts to arouse public feeling and present unified
 opposition, now is having difficulty in extricating itself from an
 embarrassing internal political problem, and in relieving its strained
 relations-Tdth the US.  Without much success, the Government is trying
 to shift public attention from the reparations issue to the problem
 of security against future aggression, on which it feels US assurances
 can more readily be obtained.
 Southeast Asia
 The Burmese Government, after having displayed little interest
 in the treaty's preparation, suddenly announced that it cannot approve
 any Japanese treaty which makes no provision for reparations to Burma.
 The chief reason for this rejection, however, appears to be fear of
 antagonizing Communist China.
 The Indonesian language press has been generally critical of the
 treaty, vaguely complaining of "American influence, " and reasserting
 Indonesia's concern over war damages and security.  The Cabinet, however
 has approved Indonesia's participation in the conference, although there
 are indications that this country, too, will press for a firmer reparations
 commitment from Japan,
 The Associated States of Indochina, while expressing no concern on
 the terms of the treaty, are eager to participate as a means of elevating
 their international standing.  As constitutional heirs of a power at war
 with Japan, their right to participate in the multilateral treaty would
 be similar to that of Indonesia.
 Nationalist Mina
 The Formosan Government, while giving general approval to the treaty
 provisions, took great exception to being excluded from the list of
 signatories.  Based on the contention that China's major part in the war
 against Japan has been unfairly evaluated, the opinion of press, public
 and official circles is united in condemning in violent terms this aspect
 of the treaty, generally ascribed to British influence.  Initial anger
 and disappointment appear to be abating, and the Government is now
 resigned to concluding a separate bilateral agreement with Japan.
 South Korea
 The South Korean Governments already in vociferous opposition to
 the Kaesong ceasefire talks, found the draft treaty further cause for
 alarm.  Failure to include the ROK Government in the list of signatories,
 and failure of the treaty to provide for a clear-cut renunciation of
 extensive Japanese property rights in,Korea, evoked critical and indig-
 nant comment by Government officials and the inspired press.

 India's major concern with the draft treaty has been to eliminate
 those clauses which might give offense to the communist nations or which
 might infringe upon Japans sovereignty.  With this background., the
 Government has called for.draft recognition of Formosata return to an
 unspecified China, the return of the'Ryukyus, Bonins and Kuriles to
 Jam n, and the elimination of the clause permitting t  past-treaty
 stationing of foreign troops in Japan,. India so far has not committed
 itself to conference participation.

 Stems Taken to Prevent Panama Flag Vessels from Engaging in Trade with
 China.
 The Panama Government is slowly responding to the US effort to
 gain its cooperation in curtailing the shipment of strategic war
 materials to Communist China,  The elimination of ships under
 Panama registry from the Western flag merchant fleet engaged in this
 trade would be a substantial contribution to the effectiveness of the
 UN embargo.
 The US suggested as early as 4 June that Panama'agree to cancel
 the registry of any ship under its flag which called at a North
 Korean or Chinese Communist port..  Panama could thereby avoid unfavor-
 able publicity, which is one of its most important concerns, and
 could also contribute to the UN effort to meet aggression in Korea.
 During June, Panama agreed in principle to cancel the registry
 of vessels carrying strategic materials to.the prohibited ports and
 agreed further to examine the propriety of taking action in all
 cases of vessels scheduled to call at these ports.  Panama authorized
 those US consular representatives who customarily act for Panama to
 pick up the registry of Panama flag vessels engaging in trade with
 the prohibited ports, and then to refer the case to the Panama
 Government for action.  Assurances were given that this authority
 would be granted to all persons representing Panama's interests
 abroad,  The State Department accordingly notified those US repre-
 sentatives to whom Panama's authorization applied.  Thus far US
 consuls in Calcutta, Karachi and Hamburg have picked up the papers
 of Panamanian flag vessels loaded with cargo for Communist China.
 Further Panamanian action was dilatory, however. Na Panamanian
 consul picked up the'papers of any ship under this authorization,
 and on 19 July it was reported that at least one Panamanian consul
 was still without instructions from his government. Furthermore,
 when the US representative in Karachi telegraphed on 6 July that he
 had picked up the papers of a Panama flag vessel, he received no
 word  as to a Panama Government decision on the case until after the
 US State Department telegraphed "urgently requiring" precise
 definition of Panama's position.  Thereupon, the Panama Government came
 to a decision that the ship, which had meanwhile sailed without its
 papers, should have its registry cancelled.
 A decree was due to be issued the end of July to give it official
 force.  This decree permits the consuls and consular representatives
 abroad to cancel registry, without further authorization, in all cases
 in which Panama flag vessels are transporting contraband to the Chinese
 Communists or North Koreans.  The necessity of proving that a given
 ship is carrying contraband limits the effectiveness of the measure,
 but the transfer of the sphere of decision from the central government
 of Panama to the US and Panama representatives abroad should at least

 Ambassador Wiley hopes to persuade the Panama Government to
 broaden the scope of its decree in line with the original State
 Department suggestion for canceling the registry of all China-bound
 ships, irrespective of cargo.  While negotiations may, be protracted,
 results can probably be attained, given the present relatively
 favorable status of US-Panama relations,
