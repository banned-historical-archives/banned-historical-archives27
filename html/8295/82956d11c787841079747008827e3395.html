 Triumphs and Disasters

 CIA: How Super the Sleuths?
 There are areas of government-of every government-that by their
 nature must operate in secrecy. The CIA-the Central Intelligence
 Agency of the U.S. Government, which does everything from count-
 ing Russian missiles to capturing counterspies-is such an area.
 Using only facts already known to the Russians, NEWSWEEK Sen-
 ior Editor James M. Cannon puts together a picture of the agency
 whose role in Laos and Cuba has blown up a new storm of controversy.
 After the passengers left the Russian
 Aeroflot liner at the field outside Vienna,
 a ground crew came aboard to clean up
 and get the plane ready for the return
 flight. There was the usual litter-a tat-
 tered magazine, paper napkins, the re-
 mains of sandwiches, empty bottles-and
 all went into the trash, along with a bent
 coat hanger and a broken cup. A few
 hours later the airport garbage conces-
 sionaire loaded the trash in his little
 truck and hauled it away. En route to
 the dump, he stopped and delivered the
 box of Soviet trash, which had been kept
 separate, to a man who was willing to
 pay for it. The man was not a crazy
 junk collector; he was an agent for the
 U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.
 Sifting through the trash, the CIA
 agent spotted the coat hanger, and re-
 membered it was on his priority list. He
 picked it out, along with several other
 items, wrapped them, and left them in
 .an appointed spot-in this case a locker
 in a busy railroad station. When the
 package  arrived at the nearest CIA
 headquarters, the agent's superiors were
 elated To them what seemed like an
 tirely overlooked the fact that he also
 was politically unpopular, and his army
 was almost entirely worthless.
 The other humiliation was in Cuba,
 where the CIA clearly failed to grasp the
 political realities of the situation. The
 CIA believed the information it received
 from one group of Cuban refugees, that
 the Cuban people were ripe for revolu-
 tion; it discounted the information that
 said this simply was not so.
 One day recently, after the defeat of
 the attempt (made with CIA help) to
 overthrow Castro, Allen W. Dulles, di-
 rector of the Central Intelligence Agency,
 sat in his office overlooking the Potomac,
 contemplating the tragic incident. Dulles
 is an impressive man. His height (6
 feet), white hair, leonine head, and
 erect bearing give him the stamp of dis-
 tinction. Normally, he radiates an ebul-
 lient confidence. But on that sad and
 somber afternoon, Dulles's eyes seemed
 tired, his face was drawn, and his
 shoulders sagged.
 Too  Soon?  Too  Late?  Speaking
 slowly and carefully, Dulles conceded
 that Castro's strength had been under-
 estimated. But he emphasized that the
 Cuban rebel group taking part in the
 landing had their own intelligence; and
 that they-the men who were actually
 going to risk their lives-were convinced
 that they could get ashore and hold a
 beachhead until Cuban rebel reinforce-
 ments could come in. "They were deter-
 mined to fight Castro," Dulles said.
 "Were we to say `no'? Were we to tell
 ordinary coat hanger was more valuable   Gen. Phoumi Nosavan, mainly on the them, `it's too soon' or `it's too late'?
 than diamonds.                           ground  that he  was  strongly  anti- JAI., to tell them `it's no use'?"

 put together, that the Russians were
 building a powerful long-range bomber.
 They knew about test flights, numbers of
 planes in production, and even had pho-
 tographs of the plane. They did not
 know its range or bombload, but they did
 know that shavings from the machining
 of the wing were remelted and made
 into a particular type of coat hanger.
 At last, the CIA had obtained one. By
 chemical tests and spectroanalysis, the
 agency learned exactly what metals
 were being used in the wing of the
 plane. The formula for the alloy was the
 last piece in the puzzle; with that, CIA's
 experts in aircraft engineering could tell
 both the range and the bombload of that
 particular Soviet bomber.
 The  little-publicized  case  of  the
 Red coat hanger was typical of the CIA
 at its best. Unfortunately, the CIA was
 in the news this week because of two
 defeats. (These defeats were so spec-
 tacular that President Kennedy is con-
 sidering  transferring  some  of  the
 functions of CIA elsewhere.)
 One setback was in Laos, where the

 Even in Communist China, the CIA

 tion of Latin American Communists, CIA -
 had a detailed report on the meeting by
 the time the Latin Americans arrived
 back home. The anonymous heroism of
 the agent who succeeded in this coup is
 typical of the CIA man at his best.
 There is no doubt, however, that CIA
 is saddled with too many "spooks"-
 pompous amateurs, more visible than nu-
 merous, often with great responsibilities.

 there sat the CIA man-with trench
 coat and pork-pie hat.
 In Washington itself, the tales about
 the CIA seem endless.
 There is the story about two personal
 friends of President Kennedy who gave a
 }   costume party to honor the New Fron-
 tier. Quite a few of the frontiersmen
 showed  up-Adlai  Stevenson,  Averell
 Harriman,   Arthur   Schlesinger Jr.,
 Kenneth Galbraith, Stewart Udall. The
 best costume, the guests agreed, was
 worn by a bearded man in a green
 fatigue uniform, with a mock subma-
 chine gun slung over his shoulder.
 The wearer: Robert Amory Jr., dep-
 uty director of intelligence for CIA. The
 time: Three months ago, when the CIA
 was planning the Cuban operation.
 Within the CIA in Washington, none-
 theless, almost all employes have at least
 a "shallow cover," and even secretaries
 are instructed to tell their friends: "I
 work for the Army." The need for "com-
 partmentation" and the doctrine of "need
 to know" are constantly dinned into all
 members of the agency. People who
 work in one office may have absolutely
 no idea what is going on in the next of-
 fice; many doors are fitted with combina-
 tion locks; every man is supposed to ask
 himself: "Does he need to know?" if
 even a close colleague asks him an offi-
 cial question. One CIA man who reports
 directly to Allen Dulles says that if their
 discussion gets off one project and drifts
 to another, Dulles will suddenly stop
 and say: "I won't talk about that."
 No Social Bhu:der: Although Dulles
 is one of Washington's greatest party-
 goers-"Next to Mrs. Cafritz, Allen has
 the busiest social calendar in town," says
 one old friend-he is rarely accused of
 dropping an indiscreet remark.
 A main device to prevent a Commu-
 nist from getting into the CIA is the lie-
 detector test that all employes must take.
 Amid the welter of questions, there
 are always two: "Have you given any
 official information to anyone?" "Have
 you had any homosexual relations?"
 "It isn't that the polygraph helps us
 catch people lying," said one CIA official.
 "It makes people tell the truth."
 Even some old-time CIA employes are
 unnerved by the test, and prospective
 employes have been known to break
 down from the nervous strain,  (They
 are rejected as emotionally unstable.)
 These  tests-and  others-make sure
 that as far as is humanly possible, the
 CIA agents who do go abroad on clan-
 destine missions will not crack under the
 do -strain of continual danger, or under the
 stress of fear for the failure of the mis-
 sion itself.
 While clandestine intelligence will al-
 ways be vital, perhaps 80 per cent of all
 information about what is going on in
 Communist countries is obtained openly.

 Newsweek, May 8, 1961
 Plus and Minus
 Bright success and grim failure have
 marked the fourteen-year history of the
 Central Intelligence Agency. In the Ber-
 lin tunnel that CIA dug in 1955 (above),
 agents listened in on Soviet military tele-
 phones and Teletypes for months before
 the Russians caught on. On a CIA tip,
 Col. Rudolph Abel (left), a Russian spy-
 master operating in Brooklyn, was dis-
 covered in 1957 and jailed; and breaking
 the Abel spy ring closed off a major
 channel of information the Soviets had in
 the U.S. But tragedy caught the anti-
 Castro Cuban expedition (below) that
 CIA helped organize and equip. Castro's
 own intelligence agents had tipped him
 off where the landing was to take place,
 and the  Castro  guns  were  waiting
 before the rebels all reached shore.

 Communist diplomats and attaches do
 the same in the U.S. Scientists love shop-
 talk, and all accounts of international sci-
 entific conferences are carefully combed
 for new information.
 The nearest newsstand is a potential
 gold mine of intelligence. We buy Com-
 munist publications, just as they buy
 ours: Some 200,000 pieces of "open lit-
 erature" are trucked into CIA every
 month. In the hands of an expert, a pro-
 vincial paper, technical magazine, road
 map, or timetable might provide the
 missing piece of a puzzle. And the CIA
 has experts on almost everything. One
 official  who  has  served  in  several
 branches of government, including the
 CIA, says: "There is more talent per
 square foot in the CIA than in any other
 branch of the government-even allowing
 for all the oddballs and incompetents."
 Experts on Exports: There are ex-
 perts on Soviet schools and on Chinese
 boat-building. There are button experts
 -men who can learn much about Rus-
 sian production methods by examining
 the buttons the Russians are making.
 There are experts in factory markings
 who can look at a dockside photograph
 taken anywhere in the world and, by
 reading the markings on the crates, tell
 what's in the box, when and where it
 was made, and its eventual destination.
 There are people who can tell from a
 change in the freight rates of the Czecho-
 slovak state railway that a new factory
 has probably opened in a town in the
 Urals that is not on any map.
 All such odds and ends are carefully
 assessed, evaluated, and stored away.
 "The heart of intelligence is the record
 system," one U.S. expert likes to say,
 and CIA has what is probably the world's
 most extensive and efficient system of in-
 telligence records. It contains almost
 everything-detailed vital statistics of
 foreign countries, data on the quality of
 Uzbek farm machinery, a physical de-
 scription of an obscure Communist leader
 in Outer Mongolia.
 The  Machine:  The  records  are
 available 24 hours a day. Suppose, for
 example, a CIA man in Western Europe
 needs information about Ludwig Koch
 (a fictitious name), who claims to be a
 travel agent in Chemnitz. The name goes
 off to Washington, and a young girl runs
 it through the central index. Out comes
 a long list of names, aliases, addresses,
 and associations. She eliminates the ref-
 erences that are obviously wrong, and
 sends the man in the field a detailed
 report on Koch. It might show that he
 was telling the truth; or it might show
 that he was a Nazi soldier who defected
 to the Russians in World War II, drinks
 heavily, gambles, and has a brother-in-
 law inside Russia.
 CIA must have
 tarn, in neutral countries, in allied coun-
 tries, and in the U.S. too. Suppose there
 is a sudden need for an American expert
 on Islamic law; CIA must be able to
 locate him. (The odds are that anyone
 reading this story is included in the CIA
 files-if he has ever been in the armed
 forces, has ever applied for a passport,
 or has accomplished something in a par-
 ticular field, or simply attained success

 is probably in the Russian central in-
 telligence files, too.)
 Of all CIA's responsibilities, one of

 Included in the casebook was a de-
 tailed account of the operations of Col.
 Rudolph Ivanovich Abel, the Russian
 spymaster who was arrested in New York
 City on June 21, 1957. The CIA and the
 FBI together cracked the Abel case, but
 the first information about Abel came
 from CIA counterintelligence men who
 questioned Reino Hayhanen, a lieutenant
 colonel in Soviet intelligence who de-

 the most important, but least-known, is
 counterespionage. The Communist espio-
 nage network is vast, extensive, relent-
 less. Communists are known to have
 stolen the U.S. secret of the A-bomb,
 to have penetrated American defense
 plants, to have people at the United
 Nations who handle nothing but espio-
 nage. Russia always denies such activity,
 but it may be presumed that the Com-
 munists are engaged in more espionage
 than. all the free world put together.
 After the U-2 incident, CIA prepared
 a "Casebook/Soviet Espionage and Sub-
 version" for Ambassador Henry Cabot
 Lodge to use in answering Soviet attacks
 tart-defectors  are  prime  sources  of
 intelligence-that Allen Dulles himself
 flew to New York to meet Hayhanen,
 guarantee his safety, and help find Abel.
 Dulles unquestionably understands the
 deep motives and bizarre concerns of
 the professional spy, for he has been an
 espionage agent himself-and a very good
 one. Indeed, his personal exploits in
 Switzerland during World War II sug-
 that Dulles may well be the best
 gest
 spy the U.S. ever had.
 Dulles got into espionage after careers
 in diplomacy and the law. Born in Water-
 town, N.Y., on April 7, 1893, he.went
 to Princeton ('14), served in the State

 Department for ten years, then joined
 his older brother, John Foster, in the
 law firm of Sullivan and Cromwell. In
 1942, Maj. Gen. William J. Donovan
 asked Allen Dulles to head the OSS of-
 fice         in  Switzerland.  There,  Dulles
 worked with anti-Nazi Germans trying to
 assassinate Hitler, got more than 2,000
 top secret documents from the German
 Foreign Ministry, gave the Allies their
 first reports on the German rocket tests at
 Peenemiinde, and arranged for the sur-
 render of 1 million Germans in Italy.
 He tried going back to law, but his
 heart was in intelligence, so he joined
 CIA and in February of 1953, became
 its director.
 For more than eight years, Dulles has
 dedicated himself to his job, giving it ten
 or twelve hours a day, expanding and
 improving his staff, developing new fa-
 cilities and techniques, doing his best to
 make CIA the best intelligence agency
 in the world. And there is no question
 but that his devotion has paid off. French
 and British security officers privately ex-
 press great admiration for CIA. American
 intelligence officials-especially the old-
 timers from OSS days-say that what
 Dulles has really given the CIA is pro-
 fessionalism. Yet Dulles himself is the
 first to admit that CIA has much to
 learn and far to go.
 Taking the Blame: After the U-2,
 the criticism most often heard was that
 CIA was setting its own policies, that it
 did not tell President Eisenhower about
 the Powers planned flight. The truth is
 that CIA begins no major mission without
 clearing it with the Secretary of Defense,
 the Secretary of State, and the President
 himself. Everyone involved knew that
 the May Day U-2 flight would be a
 great risk especially with the summit
 coming up; but the information the U-2
 was to gather was so important that the
 CIA wanted to take the risk anyway.
 Neither  Defense, nor  State, nor the
 White House vetoed it.
 After Powers went down, CIA wanted
 to take the public blame alone. But some
 State Department officials and press sec-
 retary James C. Hagerty argued that Mr.
 Eisenhower  should  personally  accept
 public responsibility for the flight. He
 did so. Today, ironically, most of official
 Washington still believes Mr. Eisenhower
 didn't know beforehand about the last,
 tragic U-2 mission. Khrushchev, presum-
 ably, believes he did know.
 The central issue of the CIA is not
 that it acts without authority; the issue
 is that CIA, once given an assignment,
 on occasion has exhibited an astonishing
 ineptitude in carrying it out.
 The basic reason is that the CIA ten-
 dency to support the most militant anti-
 Communist is built into the system. Few
 Americans  with  any  real  skill  in
 practical politics ever go into CIA. And

 the operator to see her mistakes before she makes them.
 Other ten-key adding machines are "blind." The operator can't tell
 what figures she has entered until they're added or printed. And then
 it's too late. But on the Friden Model ACY adding machine, the
 Check Window dials let the operator verify the entry-or correct it-
 before it's added or printed. The result? Significantly fewer mistakes,
 far less time wasted in error correction.

 E                 ARE a nation of hard losers.
 We bring up our young to win
 and to reserve their admiration for
 winners. The late Knute Rockne re-
 flected the true American spirit in ac-
 knowledging that he wanted no good
 losers on his football teams. The coach
 who loses can expect to be hanged
 in effigy by the students and fired by
 the trustees. As a people we terribly
 want to win and, perhaps for that
 reason, we make a habit of winning.
 In all this, President Kennedy is
 the ultimate American. Up until last
 week, he had never in his life lost a
 really important decision.
 That is why the experience of los-
 ing in Cuba was more traumatic for
 him than for the country. Here was
 a venture planned, outfitted, and
 mounted by our presumably ablest in-
 telligence and military experts with
 the specific approval of the President.
 It was an unmitigated failure. The
 Central Intelligence Agency bobbled
 the landing through mistaken intelli-
 gence estimates or faulty operations.
 Meanwhile,  the  President's  state-
 ments and activities tended to make
 the Castro threat to our national secu-
 rity seem worse than it is in fact.
 Once the dimensions of the tragedy
 became known, the inevitable hunt
 for scapegoats started. The President
 put a quick stop to this by calling off
 the hunters and himself accepting full
 responsibility for the misadventure.
 His perspective fully restored, he sen-
 sibly set about the business of dis-
 covering what had gone wrong, not
 to assess blame but to learn what he
 could from a humiliating defeat in or-
 der to avoid another like it.
 Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor, retired
 former Army Chief of Staff, was re-
 called to conduct the inquiry. Work-
 ing with him would be the President's
 brother Robert, Adm. Arleigh Burke,
 and Allen Dulles. Burke and Dulles
 would be reviewing their own errors
 for both had been involved in the Cu-
 ban affair. Their inclusion in the panel
 was an earnest of the President's de-
 sire for facts rather than heads.
 The White House needed no in-
 quiry  to  draw  several  tentative
 conclusions from the Bay of Pigs ex-
 perience. The most important of them
 38 Q I O S
 was that there is an indispensable ele-
 ment missing from the nation's organ-
 ization for cold war. For want of a
 better designation, it is called para-
 military capacity.  However serious
 the so-called missile gap may be,
 however inadequate in certain con-
 tingencies  our  conventional forces
 would be, our strength in these de-
 partments is nevertheless formidable.
 Yet we could lose most of the world
 to Communism without  getting  a
 chance to defend it either with mis-
 sile-borne atomic weapons or with
 Army, Navy, and Air Force. What
 we  need  in  places  like Laos,
 Vietnam, and even Cuba are ex-
 perts in counter-subversion, counter-
 infiltration, and all the distasteful arts
 of undercover warfare.
 Several agencies now  engage in
 this kind of activity but on a limited
 scale. The CIA is presumed to have
 the largest covert force in being. The
 Pentagon has an office of special op-
 erations                                                         under  Marine Lt.  Gen.
 Graves B. Erskine, a specialist in
 guerrilla warfare, and Secretary of
 Defense  McNamara  recently  ap-
 pointed Air Force Brig. Gen. Edward
 Lansdale his assistant in charge of un-
 conventional war programs. Strange
 men  in  civilian  attire invariably
 named Smith visit special operations
 headquarters and then disappear.
 The White House feeling seems to
 be that there are not enough of these
 Smiths and that their talents are not
 well enough utilized. It is generally
 expected that Taylor will recommend
 that the CIA be required to confine
 itself to intelligence activities and di-
 vest itself of other operations. How-
 ever, he may hesitate to house the
 Smiths at the Pentagon because the
 conventional forces are not really hos-
 pitable to the unconventional ideas
 and tactics indicated by the present
 unconventional world situation.
 The American people, who want
 their games won cleanly and right
 away-no eye-gouging in the scrim-
 mages unless absolutely unavoidable
 -won't like what they are permitted
 to know about paramilitary operations.
 But their predilection for winning will
 probably  outweigh  their  scruples
 against an eye for an eye.
 0lv4 W _,41, AFFAIRS
 phasis is on getting intelligence, espe-
 cially about what the Communists are
 doing, and the best way to find out
 about Reds is to establish contact with
 the national secret police.
 An agent cannot hope to duplicate its
 network. "The result is that the system
 tends to make the U.S. clandestine allies
 of reaction," says a former CIA man who
 now holds elective office. "When it comes
 to recommendations about politics, the
 safe project is to support the element
 which is most anti-Communist."
 Now, after Cuba and Laos, some Ad-
 ministration officials feel that CIA should
 spin off its political and military opera-
 tions, and concentrate on intelligence.
 The question of separating intelligence
 and operations is certain to come up be-
 fore the committee-headed by Gen.
 Maxwell Taylor and including Attorney
 General Robert Kennedy-appointed by
 President Kennedy to review CIA's ac-
 tivities. Their report is almost sure to
 propose that the nation place greater
 emphasis on the creation of good demo-
 cratic leaders in the emergent nations of
 Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and on
 training national troops to win their own
 struggles for freedom.
 Whatever the Taylor-Kennedy recom-
 mendations, Dulles himself may not be
 present to put them into effect. He is 68
 now, and while he is still as active as
 any man on his staff, he will probably
 retire once President Kennedy knows
 whom he wants for the next CIA direc-
 tor. Dulles views this prospect with equa-
 nimity. "I couldn't have had a job
 more concerned with trying to unmask
 and defeat the objectives  of Com-
 munism," he said recently, in a reflec-
 tive mood. "If I can make a contribution
 here, I would like to leave the United
 States  a  better  intelligence  system."
