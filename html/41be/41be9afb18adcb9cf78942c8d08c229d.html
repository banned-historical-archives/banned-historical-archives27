 EAST-WEST RELATIONS
 USSR ATTACKS U.S. WEAPONS PLANS, AFFIRMS "SERIOUSNESS" ON SALT
 Moscow propaganda continues routinely to attack U.S. plans for moving
 forward with deployment of the Safeguard ABM system and MIRV's as an
 escalation of the arms race and to warn that deployment may adversely
 affect the strategic arms limitation talks (SALT) opening in Vienna
 on 16 April.  At the same time,, it reaffirms Soviet "seriousness"
 toward the talks and urges Washington to follow suit.  In this vein,
 PRAVDA commentator Vishnevskiy on 20 March says that the "international
 public has repeatedly noted the USSR's goodwill and constructive
 approach" to SALT; he concludes that the other side's goodwill is
 also required for the negotiations to be successful.  And a commentary'
 by Fedorov for North American listeners on the sane day, drawing
 on the 7 March PRAVDA Observer article, says that the USSR approaches
 the upcoming talks "with the most serious intentions" and hopes that
 the United States will display the same attitude.
 The Fedorov commentary, in registering displeasure over the
 Administration's decision on ABM's and MIRV's, suggests the
 possibility of Soviet countermeasures.  In his words, it is
 understandable for the Soviet Union and the other soci,,ist
 countries to feel a "need to respond to measures of this kind,
 being concerned about their security.  Whatever the Soviet Union
 has done to build up its defense potential is   response to the
 frenzied nuclear and missile race in the United States."  A
 foreign-language commentary by Glazunov on the 17th had similarly
 threatened counteraction, noting that the USSR "must draw conclusions
 and take measures corresponding to the true state of affairs."
 Propaganda remains characteristically silent on the nature of the
 proposals likely to be presented by the Soviet delegation at
 Vienna.  TASS and the domestic service have, however, taken note
 of the resolution approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
 on the 20th urging the United States and the Soviet Union to seek
 to negotiate at SALT a freeze on offensive and defensive m',ssiles.
 Moscow has not been heard to report President Nixon's 21 March
 press conference remarks on SALT, in which he indicated that such
 a goal is "what SALT is all about."  Moscow has also ignored the
 President's observatior, at the same press conference, that the
 Soviet negotiators at the Helsinki phase of the talks "did not come
 in with generalized language,  . . . but they came in with very
 precise weapon systems, by weapons systems analysis."

 Moscow has long been on record as rejecting the notion that progress
 at SALT should be linked to other areas of U.S.-Soviet confrontation.
 While the linkage question has not been prominent in comment in
 recent months, two articles currently touch upon it.  Writing in
 IZVESTIYA on 18 March, commentator Sagatelyan takes note of the
 fact that a Washington POST article has interpreted "published and
 unpublished statements by Washington leaders" to mean that if the
 Soviet Union is interested in the success of the Vienna talks, "it
 ought to take into account the fact that this success depends on
 what changes will take place in the USSR's position concerning the
 Near East problem . . . and the war in Vietnam."  Sagatelyan asks
 if this is an attempt to "dictate conditions" to Moscow, and concludes
 that such tactics have not succeeded in the past and will not work
 now.  An article in RED STAR the following day by Col. Leontyev
 charges former New York TIMES observer Hanson Baldwin with trying
 to "buy and sell peace" with his suggestion that progress at SALT
 be dependent on Soviet concessions--among others, the cessation of
 aid to the Vietnamese and the Arabs and the tearing down of the
 Berlin wall.

 THE NEAR EAST
 MOSCOW WARNS OF COUP PLOTS AFTER ASSASSINATION IN CYPRUS
 In the wake of the authorized TASS statement of 17 February charging
 NATO, Greek, and local "reactionary" forces with plotting aginst
 Cyprus' independence, Moscow seems to have been slow to make propaganda
 capital out of the attempted assassination of President Makarios
 on 8 March.  In the week following the release of the TASS statement,
 broadcast attention to Cyprus was a relatively low one and a half
 percent of total comment; this figure dropped markedly in the
 following week, rising again with publicity for the 12th congress
 of the Cyprus communist party, AKEL.  In the week after the
 attempted assassination, Moscow devoted almost four percent of total
 comment to Cyprus, but this consisted largely of publicity for
 Podgornyy's message to Makarios condemning the attempt on his life
 by "forces of reaction."
 TASS on the 8th promptly reported the attempt, attributing it to
 "fascist terrorist elements" and going on to recount an emergency
 resolution adopted by AKEL that day, the concluding day of the party
 congress, which expressed indignation at the action by "fascist
 agents of imperialism."  Broadcasts in Greek and Turkish to Cyprus
 on the 9th, as well as a foreign-language commentary by Vavilov that
 day, followed established lines in underscoring the strategic
 importance of Cyprus in view of Middle East tension, and routinely
 accused NATO and its "agents" of efforts to bring Cyprus into NATO
 and turn the island into its place d'armes in the region.  The
 propaganda also insisted that the "imperialists," alarmed at the
 possibility of a successful conclusion of the intercommunal talks, are
 intensifying their "secret subversive activity" against the republic.
 A KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA article on the 11th stopped short of accusing
 ti:' rightist National Front of responsibility for the assassination
 attempt but denounced the activities of its members, claiming they
 were in the pay of the imperialists and were acti,:g on their orders
 to effect enosis, establish a military dictatorship on the island, and
 subject Cyprus to "NATO ensl-.vement."
 The assassination on 15 March of former Cypriot interior and defense
 minister Yiorkatzis, which further clouded Cyprus' political scene,
 was at first virtually ignored by Moscow.  TASS on the 16th briefly
 reported the assassination, and on the 17th noted an AKEL statement

 briefly condemning the action.  A commentary in Greek and Turkish to
 Cyprus on the 18th  gingerly observed that Yiorkatzis had been killed
 "by persons so far unknown," and that "many aspects of this crime
 are still unknown."  It then turned to stereotyped accusations against
 "NATO imperialist circles backing the terrorists" and strongly
 supported the intercommunal talks as the "only right line" for
 normalizing the Cyprus situation and strengthening the island's
 independence,,  Similarly, a broadcast the next day to Yugoslavia
 cautiously declared that until the results of the investigation were
 made public, "we will not venture to guess which particular imperialist
 agency in Cyprus was the direct organizer of these crimes."  It is
 clear, the broadcast added, that the recent events are part of a
 "broader imperialist conspiracy" against Cyprus' independence.  It
 cited British press speculation on the authors of the Yiorkatzis
 assassination, and seemingly tried to dissociate Yiorkatzis himself
 from involvement with alleged machinations of the combined reactionary-
 Greek-imperialist forces, asserting that he favored preserving Cyprus'
 independence while the National Front seeks enosis, and claiming that
 such "extremist elements" are "being linked" with the presence in
 Cyprus of "a number of reactionary Greek army officers."
 Prior to his assassination, Yiorkatzis had been characterized in the
 weekly NEW TIMES (Russian edition 12 March) as an "antigovernmerb
 element" aid was said to have been "closely associated with the CIA
 and Greek Colonel Ladas."  Ladas in turn, according to NEW TIMES,
 is regarded by Greek Premier Papadhopoulos "as a dangerous rival
 because of his close connections with American intelligence agencies."
 NEW TIMES viewed the CIA, Ladas, and National Front leaders as "links
 in the same chain," and said this was where one should look for
 the organizers of the attempted assassination of Makarios.
 An effort to exploit the situation seems to have been initiated on
 19 March when the Soviet ambassadors in Cyprus and Turkey called on
 President Makarios and Turkish Foreign Minister Caglayangil, according
 to Nicosia and Ankara radios, respectively; on the 20th Nicosia
 reported that Greek Foreign Minister Pipinelis had received the Soviet
 ambassador to Athens.  Moscow has made no public reference to these
 meetings, but the activity was explained by AKEL organ KHARAVYI
 on the 21st:  The Soviet Government, it said, "has made identical
 representations to the three guarantor powers of the Zurich-London
 agreements, demanding absolute respect for the independence of Cyprus
 and the avoidance of any action which could worsen the situation on
 the island."  It is believed, KHARAVYI added, that the Soviet Union
 "once again reiterated that it is not going to remain indifferent to
 actions for the overthrow of President Makarios and the dissolution
 of the Cyprus state."

 26 MARCH 1970
 KHARAVYI said it was not known whether the USSR delivered relevant notes
 to the three governments, but if it had, "their content should
 become known in the next few days."  The representations were made
 through calls by the Soviet ambassadors to the foreign ministers of
 Greece, Britain, and Turkey, while the ambassador in Cyprus also met
 with Makarios.  KHARAVYI recalled that "the previous Tolubeyev-
 Mak arios meeting, approximately one month ago," was followed by the
 TASS statement warning of "conspiratorial plans against Cyprus."
 In a Moscow-datelined report on the 25th, KHARAVYI said "diplomatic
 sources" there had confirmed that the Soviet Government "in the past
 few days" made "strong representations" to the governments of Britain,
 Turkey  Greece, and the United States, again stressing that the USSR
 "vigilantly watches the criminal conspiracies against Cyprus."
 (In the wake of these Soviet representations, Athens has made attempts
 to present the Soviets as responsible for Turkish warnings against a
 possible coup in Cyprus.  Foreign Minister Caglayangil, prior to his
 meeting with the Soviet ambassador, was reported by Ankara radio on
 the 19th as having said that efforts to achieve enosis "through fait
 accomplis will find themselves facing Turkey with all its might and
 potential."  Athens radio on the 21st quoted the Athens paper
 ELEVTHEROS KOSMOS as calling "unfounded" 4nkara allegations of an
 imminent coup in Cyprus to achieve enosis.  The paper added that "a
 few days ago the Soviet Government fired fireworks of a similar nature."
 On the 23d, citing ATHENS NEWS AGENCY reports from "reliable Nicosia
 sources," Athens radio said the Turkish Cypriot leadership had assured
 the Greek Cytriots that Turkey had softened Caglayangil's statement after
 being informed that Soviet reports to the Turkish Government of an
 impending attempt to assassinate Makarios, mount a coup d'etat, and
 declare enosis: were fabricated reports "aimed at serving Soviet
 interests.")
 PRAVDA, IZVESTIYA Accuse "Far Right Extremists," NATO
 The first apparent propaganda charges of a plot to carry out a coup in
 Cyprus are made in PRAVDA and IZVESTIYA articles of the 20th.*  In
 IZVESTIYA's morning edition that day Matveyev declares that the
 "conspirators" aim to execute a coup in Cyprus in the "interests of
 the far right extremist forces" who aspire to "set up their own
 dictatorship" and make Cyprus an appendage of NATO in the eastern
 Mediterranean.  He makes the usual plea for closure of foreign bases
 in Cyprus, declaring that now that Britain  .s withdrawing "East of
 Suez," the British bases in Cyprus should also be liquidated.   (The
 The.IZVESTIYA article has been carried only in a broadcast to
 Yugoslavia, while the PRAVDA article has been broadcast to Greece and
 Turkey, and in both Greek and Turkish to Cyprus.

 stereotyped demands for elimination of the British bases generally
 do not include mention of U?S, operations on the island, but a
 broadcast in Greek to Cyprus on the 1.3th did call for abolition of
 foreign military bases and "espionage and sabotage centers,")
 Matveyev proceede to build a case for mainland Greek involvement in
 the events in Cyprus, citing the London DAILY TELEGRAPH to the
 effect that Greek officers serving in Cyprus are directly assisting
 the National Front, and may even be members of that organization, and
 pointing to recent "inflammatory speeches" by former EOKA '.eader
 Grivas,  NATO, of course, is the ultimate culprit, with the threads
 of the "conspiratorial activity" running from Athens to NATO h.ead-
 quarters and "the appropriate departme.lts in certain Western capitals,"
 Reiterating standard Soviet views on Cyprus, Matveyev employs a mild
 variant of the old propaganda formula that the USSR cannot remain
 indifferent to events in. the proximity of its frontiers, a formula that
 seems to have become fashionable again recently in coirent on the
 Middle East and Mediterranean,  The situation in this part of the
 Mediterranean, he says, which is not far from the frontiers of the Soviet
 Union and the socialist states of southeastern Europe, "cannot fail
 to attract our attention?"  He warns that those who are "preparing
 plans for liquidating the state of Cyprus and overthrowing its legal
 government" are assuming heavy responsibility for the possible
 consequences of such actions?  Employing the language of past Security
 Council resolutions calling for avoidance of actions infringing on the
 legal. rights and interests of Cyprus, he emphasizes that enosis "or
 anything similar which encroaches on the position of Cyprus" cannot
 be a basis for any sort of settlement?
 The PRAVDA article, by the paper's regular Greece and Cyprus commentator,
 Bragin, similarly charges that the attempted assassination of Makarios
 was aimed at a coup d'etat and establishment of a military dictatorship
 which would eliminate Cyprus' independence.  Dealing with the Yiorkatzis
 murder, Bragin cites '`t,'ypriot papers" as noting that he was assassinated
 "to prevent, the unraveling of the threads of the conspiracy being woven
 across the ocean and in Athens."  Another aspect of the assassination,
 Bragin ,_!aims, is that "certain NATO circles" want to use Yiorkatzis'
 murder "to reinforce :,heir interference in Cyprus' internal affairs,"
 Bra.gin strongly implies a NATO hand in Yiorkatzis' death, remarking
 that the Western press has many suggestions as to the assailants but
 conceals the question of who was behird theme  There is good reason for
 this, he says, since "the NATO military is bending over backward to
 free itself of responsibility for the crimes committed by their agents
 on the territory of a sovereign state"  Like Matveyevr, he calls into
 question the role of the National Front--adding the charge that its
 members "have long been in the service of the CIA--a$ well as involve-

 PEKING ENCOURAGES ARMED GUERRILLA MOVEMENTS IN INDIA
 Since mid-1967 Peking has provided propaganda support for armed
 insurrectionary movements in India and has sustained an
 unremitting polemical campaign against the two established Indian
 communist parties for having betrayed the cause of armed
 revolution in favor of "revisionist" peaceful tactics.*
 Chinese media have carried periodic accounts of l;he development
 of the peasant armed struggles in India and have provided
 generous publicity for the new, pro-Maoist Communist Party of
 India/Marxist-Leninist (CPI/M-L), particularly through
 disseminating articles from the CPI/M-L's monthly theoretical
 journal LIBERATION.  A FEOPLE'S DAILY end-of-the-year account
 of the Indian peasant movement, carried by NCNA on 18 January,
 claimed that 1969 witnessed "a vigorous development of the
 revolutionary armed struggle of the Indian peasants and a
 steady expansion and growth of their armed forces."
 Recalling that the first shot of armed struggle was fired
 under the leadership of "the revolutionaries of the Indian
 Communist Party" by the peasants in Naxalbari of Darjeeling
 District, West Bengal State, in March 1967, the article noted
 that after its founding on 22 April 1969 (Peking ignored the
 fact that this was Lenin's birth date), the CPI/M-L assumed
 the leadership of the peasant armed guerrilla struggles and
 during the remainder of 1969 made "great progress" in dealing
 "increasingly heavy blows at the reactionary Indian ruling
 classes" throughout India.  PEOPLE'S DAILY proclaimed that the
 CPI/M-L has begun to advance armed struggle "to a completely
 new stage--the stage of seizing political power and
 establishing guerrilla bases."  It documented this claim by
 noting--as have subsequent NCNA reports--that in Srikakulam
 Peking's support for Indian insurrectionary movements and
 its break with the Communist Party of India/Marxist are dis:--ussed
 in the FBIS SURVEYs of 7 July 1967, page 24, and 31 Augus; 196-T,
 page 4.

 (in northeast Andhra Pradesh) the peasants had established "people's
 political power," created "people's courts to try the enemy of the
 people," and secured base areas of armed struggle in 300 villages
 into which officials of the Indian Government cannot enter and in
 which "the reactionary state apparatus has ceased to function."
 A 14 March NCNA article demonstrates that Peking distinguishes
 between the Indian peasants' revolutionary armed struggle led by
 the CPI/M-L and "the armed struggle of the Mizo and Naga people
 for national liberation?"  Peking has displayed a ::loser affinity
 with the movement led by the CPI/M-L, pr.vi.ing it with the
 preponderance of propaganda support and claiming that it is following
 "the road of Naxalbari" and has spread ik':4 struggle to nine states
 of India.  The Chinese also encourage the Mizo and Naga movements,
 confined to mountainous regions in East India, by offering periodic
 accounts of successful attacks of the Mizo and Naga armed forces on
 the "reactionary armed troops and police, dealing heavy blows to
 the reactionary government."  Peking does not 'link the Mizo and
 Naga movements with the communist-led peasant struggle, and only
 rarely mentions the CPI/M-L in commentaries dealing with the Mizos
 and Nagas.
 Peking Sustains Attacks on Indian "Revisionist" Lines
 The Chinese propaganda ballyhoo for alleged successes of the CPI/M-L's
 Maoist strategy of armed peasant guerrilla struggle contrasts with
 its polemical campaign against the heresies and difficulties of the
 two established communist parties in India--the traditionally
 pro-Soviet Communist Party of India (CPI) and the formerly Peking-
 oriented Communist Party of India/Marxist (CPI/M).  Peking
 denounces these "traitorous revisionists" for advocating the
 "parliamentary road" to power and for participating in coalition
 governments.*
 Both the CPI and the CPI/M were until recently participants in
 united front governments in the states of Kerala and West Bengal.
 A CPI-led coalition replaced the CPI/M-dominated government of
 Ke- 't in November 1969, and President's rule was imposed on West
 Bengal on 19 March 1970 following the fall of the united front
 government in that state, in which the CPI/M was the major
 com-onent .

 The "excellent situation of the Indian people's armed revolution,"
 NCNA claimed on 6 January, had been created after "frustrating the
 capitulationist revisionist line" of "such as Namboodiripad
 (CPI/M] and his ilk and the Dange [CPI] renegade clique" who
 advocate the "parliamentary road."  NCNA noted that after "riggLng
 up 'united front' governments" in Kerala and West Bengal as
 "sinister models for 'peaceful transition," the "Indian
 revisionists" themselves directed troops and police in "the
 slaughter" of the revolutionary workers and peasants, thus proving
 to the people that the "'parliamentary road' is impassable,
 absolutely impassable."  "Revisionisc," CPI/M leader Jyoti Basu,
 deputy chief minister in charge of the police in the recently-
 fallen West Bengal united front government, was singled out in
 a 14 March NCNA commentary which charged him with issuing an
 order to "'shoot to kill' the peasants and revolutionaries."
 In a similar vein NCNA on 7 February reported a LIBERATION
 article's claim that the success of the revolutionary movement
 led by the CPI/M-L has discredited "the revisionist leadership of
 the party" which had rlaintained that "the Thought of Chairman
 Mao Tse-tung is unsuitable for India, that armed struggle cannot
 be waged in India, and that advocating armed struggle leads to the
 destruction of people's fighting organizations."  NCNA on 21 March
 viewed the collapse of the West Bengal united front government as
 still further "proof of the bankruptcy of the line of 'peaceful
 transition' energetically advertised by the Indian revisionists,"
 and it claimed that increasing numbers of peasants in West Bengal.
 "Lave spurned the 'parliamentary road' of the Indian revisionists
 and, under the leadership of the CPI/M-L, have kindled the flames
 of armed struggle in many rural areas in the state."
 CPI, CPI/M Take Cautious Stand on
 The propaganda organs of the CPI and the CPI/M reflect both parties'
 dilemma as participants in united front governments--associated on
 the one hand with governments that take action against the
 extremists, which could lay them open to charges of participating
 in the repression of revolutionaries, while on the other hand
 seeking recruits and supporters among leftist elements of the
 population.  Also, as in Andhra Pradesh, there is a fear that
 governme:tal suppression of the extremists is apt to extend to
 fringe elements of the CPI and the CPI/M and may potentia31;;
 compromise their "parliamentary road to power" through the ballot
 box.  Both parties have thus sought to walk a tightrope, castigating
 the police  officials  for excessive suppression and the revolutionary
 leaders for excessive extremism.

 While viewing the fortunes of the peasant guerrilla movement as
 currently on Lie wane, the two parties' organs express concern that,
 on the pretext of suppressing the revolutionary mov,:ments, state
 government officials are committing unneceseary atrocities?  The
 CPI's weekly publication NEW AGE carried articles in its 4 January,
 18 January, and 1 March issues calling for cessation of the police
 manhunts against the "Communist Revolutionaries and Naxalites"
 (both the CPI and the CP:':/M avoid referring by name to the
 Communist Party of Tndia/Marxist-Leninist).  CPI General Secretary
 Rao noted in the 4 January issue that even though the "extremist
 movement of the Naxalites as well as the Communist Revolutionaries
 have received a setback and are on the wane in Andhra Pradesh," and
 that, all of the top leadership of the coordination committee of
 communist revolutionaries have been arrested, atrocities continue
 to be committed "by the armed police on the people in the name of
 suppressing the Naxalites in the areas declared disturbed by the
 state             in Andhra Pradesh."  Rao said that these atrocities
 have become "unbearable" and called for an immediate cessation.
 The Andhra Pradesh. state council of the CPI, in a report submitted
 on 2 January and reviewed by NEW AGE on 18 January, coupled a
 demand for an end to police atrocities with an appeal to the
 Naxalite leaders to abandon their "present form of struggle"
 because it was being utilized "by the landlords, moneylenders, and
 the government to suppress democratic movement and adding untold
 miseries to the people."  NEW AGE reported on 1 March that the CPI
 s+,ate council in Andhra Pradesh has established a 40-member legal
 defense committee for political prisoners in that state, and that
 it has demanded the withdrawal of all cases including the conspiracy
 cast against T.N. Reddy (an extremist Naxalite leader who has recently
 been attempting to form a new--fourth--communist party in India).
 In recent months the CPI/M weekly organ PEOPLE'S DEMOCRACY has
 avoided the subject of the Naxalites, a lone exception being a
 brief reference in a long letter--published in the 1 February issue--
 from the :PI/M to the Prime Minister.  Accusing the Andhra Pradesh
 government of resorting to "most heinous and barbarous methods of
 liquidating scores of Naxalite activists," the letter warned that
 such repression is "only gladdening the hearts of the oppressive
 landlords and rapacious money-lenders, while causing indignation
 among the common people."

 PEKING HARDENS LINE ON "RULING CLIQUE llLllyEll BY INllTRA GANDHI"
 Expectations of potential improvement in Sino-Indian relations in
 the near future appear dimmed in view of a recent hardening of Peking's
 long-standing effort to discredit the domestic and foreign policies
 of the Indian national government, as evidenced by the appearance
 of personal attacks on Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.*  The
 strongest language to date is contained in an 18 March NCNA
 review of a LIBERATION article which denounces "the ruling clique
 headed by Indira Gandhi" and depicts her as a U.S. and Soviet pawn
 pursuing "basically the same anti-national anti-China policies as
 her father."
 A sharpening in the derogatory personal references to the Prime
 Minister began with a 24 December NCNA review of a December LIBERATION
 article by Charu Mazumdar, leader of the CPI/M-L, which--in contrast
 to Peking's prior impersonal denunciation of the "reactionary
 Indian Government"--referred to "the reactionary Indian Government
 headed by Indira Gandhi."** Peking used the latter terminology in
 attacking Gandhi personally in its own name in an 18 January
 PEOPLE'S DAILY commentary on tie Indian peasant armed struggle, and
 repeated the phrase in a 14 February NCNA item.  Still another
 term--"the ruling clique of India"--appeared in an 8 March NCNP.
 review of another Mazumdar LIBERATION article; NCNA itself attacked
 the "Indian ruling clique" on 12 March.  The latest stage in this
 transition was the aforementioned 18 March NCNA review of LIBERATION
 which castigated  "the ruling clique headed by Indira Gandhi."  The
 Prime Minister is still spared the more derogatory term of "fascist
 chieftain," which Peking uses to describe the leaders of Indonesia
 and Malaysia, though the trend has been in th'it direction.
 PRC Remains Intransigent on Sino-Indian Relations
 Consonant with the hardening line on the Prime Minister, Peking's
 disparagements of Indian appeals for improved relations and its
 indictments of the Indian Government for allegedly colluding with
 China's neighbors reflect an intransigent stance on Sino-Indian
 relations and continuing concern over PRC border security.
 *   Peking's treatment of Gandhi at the time of the split in the
 Indian Congress Party in late 1969 is discussed in the FBIS SURVEY
 of 20 November 1969, page 7.
 **  Peking commentaries in June and September 1968 identified Gandhi
 as "Prime Minister of the reactionary Indian Government."

 PROPONE:N'I'S 01' MEDIANIZEI) LINK, RENEW 'IIIE;[R OFil- INSIVE
 Advocates of the "unregulated" link system of farming are now
 exerting renewed pressure for the Introduction or the controversial
 Innovation on a wider scale.     Since the beginning of the year there
 has been a marked upsurge in favorable publicity for mechanized
 links In the central press, highlighted by the Initiation of a new
 series of articles in SOVIET ItUSS.IA under the rubric "Unregulated
 Links:  Experience and Prospects."  The promotional campaign In
 the preila has been accompanied by Intensive lobbying by link
 spokr~,men at recent agricultural conferences in Moscow.
 The current drive to expt.d the link system continues to be sparked
 by the leadership of the Russian republic--Politburo member Voronov's
 power base-which went on record last year in favor of the innovation.
 Support has been forthcoming from other influential quarters as well,
 however, as evidenced by the endorsements of the link system by two
 members of Brezhnev's political entourage, Kazakh First Secretary
 D.A. Kunayev and Komsomol First Secretary Ye. M. Tyazhelnikov, at
 their respective republic and Komsomol plenums last December.
 T'yazhelnikov and his Komsomol associate, V.T. Duvakin, were also
 listed among the notables attending a 16 March Moscow conference of
 link "enthusiasts" which was addressed by Voronov.
 Publicity for Link System of Farining Increases
 Agitation for the link system of farming began to pick up in the
 central press following the criticisms of economic shortcomings
 at the December CPSU plenum.  A series of "Letters from Vologda"
 by S. Ilarionov in SOVIET RUSSIA on 20, 21, and 22 January revealed
 the dissatisfaction of local farm leaders with the traditional
 farm wage system and the growing appeal of the "unregulated" link
 system of wages--a system geared to the end results of production
 rather than to the fulfillment of differentiated work norms.  The
 positive achievements of mechanized links in the RSFSR, Belorussia,
 and the Ukraine were also singled out in articles appearing in
 ECONOMIC GAZETTE on 19 January, RURAL LIFE on 27 and 29 January,
 and SOVIET RUSSIA on 21 January.

 Thoy have uniformly utresued the striking gains in peasant

 prcduct ion resulting from the introduction of' mechanized link:,
 in various part.. of the RSF'SR.  In addition, they have. stressed
 the bcnef: cial impact of the link system on peasant attitudes
 toward work.  In the only exception to this line of commentary,
 the 5 March SOVIET RUSSIA article complained about bureaucratic
 oppositi.;n to the link system by officials in two RSFSR wine
 trusts.  The Officials were said to have banned a mechanized link
 experiment in a Dagestan vineyard kolkhoz in clear disregard of
 the decision of the RSFSR Council of Ministers last March and of
 the successful results of the experiment,  This complaint was
 reiterated in a 17 March SOVIET RUSSIA editorial which praised

 other papers.  A 14 February KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA articie reported

 oblast last year, despite the bad weather conditions and the general
 underfulfillment of the oblast's annual plan. Writing in a similar

 Chelyabinsk oblast expressed enthusaism over the potentialities
 of the link system and the prospects for its "broad introduction"

 These potentialities were also highlighted in a sociological study

 Kazr.khatan, only one of whl.cii had been converted to the link
 system--the much publ.l.cizcd and highly controversial farm managed
 by Ivan Khudenko.*  Nearly all the peaoanto on Khudenko'r farm,
 which had a minuscule staff' of only two administrators and a
 total labor force of 60 persons, were found to be genuinely
 satisfied with their working conditions, actively participating
 in the farm's decision-making, and rarely involved in social
 conflicts.  This situation contrasted sharply with that in the
 other two farms, where dissatisfaction, apathy, and social tension
 were said to prevail.
 The authors of the LITERARY GAZETTE report also cited statistics
 on productivity, income, and costs which illustrated the over-'
 whelming superiority of Khudenko's farm as an economic enterprise.
 On the basis of the economic and sociological findings, the
 conclusion was drawn that the link system provided an effective
 means of increasing the efficiency of production and generating
 positive attitudes toward work among the peasantry.
 Link Spokesmen Lobby at Agriculttmal Conferences
 The public relations campaign was accompanied by active lobbying
 by link spokesmen at a series of agricultural conferences.  On
 16 February, at the first conference of representatives of the
 newly formed councils of kolkhozes in the RSFSR, Voronov's associate
 K.G. Pysin, First Deputy Chairman of the RSFSR Council of Ministers,
 called attention to the exemplary achievements of mechanized links
 in the RSFSR and to the responsibilities of agricultural agencies
 and farm leaders in promoting the innovation,  He advised the
 councils to examine the work of mechanized links and prepare
 recommendations for their "more active" introduction in 1970.
 The lobbying on behalf of the link system continued at two
 agricultural conferences in March.  On 16 March Voronov addressed
 a Moscow meeting of link "enthusiasts" organized by the editors
 of KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA.  According to the cryptic report in
 KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on 17 March, the meeting was attended by
 pioneers in the link movement and officials from the RSFSR and
 the Ukraine,  Also participating in the meeting were representa-
 tives of the USSR Ministry of Agriculture and the State Committee
 on Questions of Labor and Wages of the USSR Council of Ministers--
 two institutions which were criticized in 1967 for opposition to
 the link system (KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, 20 May 1967).

 PRESSURE FOR MINISTERIAL REFGRM CONTINUES TO BUILD
 Criticisms of economic leadership n~ the December Central Committee
 plenum and in the subsequent campaign for increased efficiency have
 intensified preszure on ministries to reform their structural
 organization,  Most proposals for ministerial reorganization involve
 eliminating the administrvtive units between the ministry and the
 individual enterprise, replacing them with territorial
 production  associations.  This shift from the branch principle of
 administration toward the former territorial principle as embodied
 in sovnarkhozes is being led by the Leningrad and Baltic leaders,
 who only reluctantly gave up the sovnarkhozes in 1965.
 Opposition to reducing ministerial power and changing the structure
 remains strong, however, and the December plenum failed to endorse
 the production associations.  Apparently, the plenum limited itself
 to demanding elimination of unnecessary echelons in economic
 administration, further development of the economic reform, and an
 end to ministerial violation of reform principles.  As Lithuanian
 Premier Manyushis said in the 14 February IZVESTIYA, there still
 is no "unified opinion about the form of subordination of a
 production association," and some want to retain main administrations
 and limit production associations to the role of an "enlarged
 enterprise."

 'Pop-level pressure for improvement in the ministerial structure
 began with a 13 October decree by the Central Committee and the
 Council of Ministers calling for cutting back administrative staffs
 of ministries, enterpricec, and organizations, in order to reduce
 administrative expenses by 1.7 billion rubles in 1970 (PRAVDA,

 issued a similar decree, which additionally ordered a specific
 review of the need for trusts, combines, and administrations,
 and urged combining of small enterprises where "advisable" to
 reduce administrative staffs (SOVIET RUSSIA, 9 December).  The
 15 December Central Committee plenum criticised the "many excess
 organs" in administration and pressed ministries to improve their
 administrative methods, according to the 13 January PRAVDA editorial.
 Last November, the People's Control Committee was ordered to
 concentrate on checking on administrative apparatus expenses and
 to make proposals to reduce staffs and simplify administrative
 structure,*  The Georgian People's Control Committee has completed
 its study of Georgian ministerial structure, and the Georgian
 Council of Ministers adopted the committee's proposals to eliminate
 various administrative subdivisions and join together many small
 enterprises (PRAVDA, 26 February).
 USSR Coal Industry Minister B. F. Bratchenko ara:ounced in the

 organs.  Nevertheless, Kovanov complained, ministries still are

 them with production associationo operat., ng on reform
 principlk-a.  The firut of these was advocated by Leningrad
 association director G.A., Kulagin in the December OKTYABR and
 by liberal economist A, Barman Ln the 11 February LITERARY
 GAZETTE, the second by Kulagi.n In the  9 January SOCIALIST
 INDUSTRY, by Lithuanian Premier Manyushis in the 14 February
 IZVEST'IYAW and by People'u Control Committee inspector S. Rudzit
 in the 17 February SOCIALIST INDUSTRY
 The Baltic and Leningrad leaders have been the most closely
 associated with these proposals and have already moved in this
 direction in their own areas.  Estonian Premier Klauson, an
 advocate of simplified administrative structure, stated that
 Est:,nia had eliminated intermediate links between the ministerial
 level ar.i. the enterprises several years ago (SOVETSKAYA ESTONIYA,
 20 December),  Lithuanian Premier Manyushis advocated a ministry-
 association--enterprise structure for national ministries In his
 14 February IZVESTIYA article.  Economist Barman, also a backer
 of the Leningrad production associations, cited Latvia as an
 example for organizing industry on the plant-ministry basis
 (NOVY MIR, December 1969).
 The strongest and most consistent pressure for ministerial reform
 has come from the Leningrad leaders, who have long been critical
 of the ministries in Moscow* and have lately accelerated their
 agitation on behalf of production associations.  Leningrad First
 Secretary Tolstikov, one of the eight speakers at the December
 plenum, presumably reiterated there his well-known support of
 associations.  G.A, Kulagin, director of one of Leningrad's
 leading production associations, in the December issue of
 CKTYABR complained of backsliding in regard to the economic
 reform and insisted that the reform be extended to central
 ministerial organs.  He recalled that the September 1965 plenum
 had "directly pointed out the need to transfer main administrations
 to financial autonomy."  Kulagin repeated his views in the 9 January
 SOCIALIST INDUSTRY, noting pressure by some officials to repeal
 some of the reform provisions and attacking ministerla.L obstruction,
 Criticizing ministries' main administrations as abstract, purely
 administrative organs uninterested in economic results, he urged
 their replacement with production associations as the main link
 between plant and ministry,  He advocated putting operational
 leadership in the production associations and reducing the role
 of Gosplan and central ministries to long-range and branch-wide
 policy and planning.

 Two post-plenum Leningrad meetings--a January oblast aktiv meeting
 (PRAVDA, 8 January) and a February obkom plenum (SOVIET RUSSIA,
 25 February) --have been used as forums to urge expansion of
 production associations and attack continuing ministerial
 opposition to production associations.  Leningrad trade union
 chief B.A. Popov utilized his speech at the late January All-
 Union Central Trade Union Council plenum (TRUD, 29 January) to
 promote the advantages of production associations, calling them
 "the most efficient path of further development of the economy."
 G.V. Romenov, Leningrad obkom second secretary and Yu. I. Zavarukhin,
 gorkom second secretary, strongly promoted Leningrad's system in
 February issues of KOMMUNIST (No. 3) and PARTY LIFE (No. 5)
 respectively.
 Press Support for Leningrad's Production Associations
 Leningrad's pro&,ction associations have received increasing press
 support since the post-plenum efficiency campaign began in early
 January.  A dozen articles and editorials have specifically praised
 Leningrad's work (editorials in the 16 January SOVIET RUSSIA, the
 28 January PRAVDA, PARTY LIFE No.  3, ECONOMIC GAZETTE No. 5, the
 18 February PRAVDA, and the 24 February IZVESTIYA, and articles in
 ECONOMIC GAZETTE No. 5, the 7 and 9 February PRAVDA, 13 February
 SOVIET RUSSIA, 14 February IZVESTIYA, and 17 February SOCIALIST
 INDUSTRY).  Other items such as a 9 January PRAVDA editorial and an
 editorial in KONIMUNIST No. 2 have proposed the creation of more
 production rssociations without referring to Leningrad specifically.
 A 13 February SOVIET RUSSIA. article by I. Karev and S. Yegorov--
 entitled "Leningraders Show the Way"-.-attacked ministries ar:d Gosplan
 for ignoring Leningrad's work.  An editorial in ECONOMIC GAZETTE No. 5
 and Zavarukhin's artic3c: in PA1%TY LIFE No. 5 asserted that the Central
 Committee had approved the Leningrad obkom's work in establishing
 production associations.  There pas, however, been no public announce-
 ment to this effect, and thus it is uncertain how specific the Cei.t ral
 Committee's approval was.
 The People's Control Committee, charged with the responsibility for
 proposing changes in ministerial structure, also appears to favor
 associations.  Chairman Kovanov advocated a miinietry-association-
 enterprise structure for the chewical industry, metallurgy, and
 construction ministries, and he approved the joining together of
 small enterprises (PRAVDA, 12 March).  Committee inspector S. Rudzit
 complained that a check by his orgar.ization had revealed that some
 machine-building ministries had no -.glans to create any associations
 and that ministries had liquidated many successful associations
 (SOCIALIST INDUSTRY, 17 February).

 One of the main attractions of production associations, in the
 eyes of local authorities, is that their creation would strip
 central minintrieo of operational control of local industry and
 return c:ritrol to the localities--in effect, a partial reversion
 to Khruoh,.hev's oovnarkhozes?  Lithuanian Premier Manyuohis, in a
 14 February IZVLSTIYA article, advocated replacing main admini.ctra-,
 ti,_)ns with production associations and argued the need to relieve
 ministries of the burden of supervising local enterprises,
 Territorial production associations, he explained, "could
 combine branch and territorial planning, which is very
 important for improving planning and comprehensive development
 of the economy of union republics and economic regions."  In the
 December NOVY Mi.R Birman also argued the need for more territorial,
 as against; branch, organization,  and he cited the advantages
 or the sovnarkhoz?s
 DRUG ADDICTION APPARENTLY A GROWING PRGBLDM IN GEORGIA
 Traffic in drugs and drug addiction appear increasingly to be
 matters of concern to the leadership of the Georgian SSR.
 Georgian First Secretary Mzhavanadze has spoken out twice on
 the issue in recent months.,
 At a Georg an Komsomol congress in late February Mzhavanadze
 admitted that a crackdown instigated in mid-1969 has not yet
 proved effective.  Although "many young people, including four
 Komsomcl members," have been sentenced fox drug addiction and
 the sale of narcotics since the issuance of a Georgian decree
 on 30 June 1969, Mzhavanadze said, "we are still apparently
 conducting insufficient work in this direction."  He concluded
 that "we must declare a most implacable war on this evil" (ZARYA
 VOSTOKA, 1 March),
 Mzhavanadze also referred to the problem during a Georgian Centrel
 Committee plenum in December 1969.  There he declared that "we
 must struggle more boldly and re::o_ttely against cases of
 hooliganism, drunkenness, drug addiction, and all antisocial
 phenomena" (ZARYA VOSTOKA, 13 December).
 The results of six months' application of the June 1969 decree,
 which stiffened earlier penalties against addicts and peddlers,
 were discussed by the Georgian Supreme Court in January 1970
 (ZARYA VOSTOKA, lA January).  The court's first deputy chairman
 reported that the courts had "noticeably intensified the struggle
 against addiction in the second half of 19699."

 UKRAINIAN TrMNfERS CHARGED WITH 'IDEOLOGICAL 'ERRORS
 A December meeting of the party members of the Ukrainian culture
 ministry on raising the ideological militancy of communists in
 theaters and other cultural institutions has resulted in a
 crackdown on Ukrainian theaters by local party leaders in several
 oblasts.
 The meeting, reported in the 12 December RADYANSKA UKRAINA,
 attacked some theaters for failing to aid the party in political
 education of the workers, and it called on the Donetsk, Sumy,
 kirovograd, Chernigov and Rovno obkoms to take action in regard
 to their local theaters.  RADYANSKA UKRAINA on 27 February reported
 the responses by the ideological leaders of these oblasts.  The Sumy
 obkom fired the director of the theater criticized and announced
 measures to "raise the ideological-artistic level of productions."
 Kirovograd obkom secretary N. Sukharevska acknowledged shortcomings
 in that oblast's culture administration and its theater and announced
 a revision of its repertory and a strengthening of work with young
 dramatists.  The Rovno ideology secretary also announced revisions
 in the local theater repertory, including addition of a play
 depicting the prewar local struggle to "reunite" the west Ukraine
 with the USSR.'
 Hardest hit was Donetsk oblast.  Its oblast culture administration
 chief was attacked by name at the December meeting for letting a
 Donetsk theater flounder.  The theater's director and chief artistic
 director have now been fired and a new artistic council appointed.
 Donetsk has had other ideological problems re ently.  A 6 January
 obkom plenum on ideological education of sciex.tific-engineering
 intelligentsia found serious shortcomings in this work and fired
 the head of the obkom's science and educational institutions section
 (Donetsk radio, 7 January).
