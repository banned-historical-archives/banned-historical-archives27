		 	the  formation  of   	the  first  "Unif ied  Anti-Vietnam  Line"  with  Prime  Minister  Khieu
			Jamphan  at  a  meeting  in  North  Korea.    	China's  Vice  Premier  Deng  Xiaoping  announced

		 	Kampuchea's  "Third  Force"   	(Buddhists)  by  the  ASF~1N  countries.
  _	     	The  world  press  at  ~resent  is  foci~sing  its  attention  on  Kampuchea.   	The  reasons
		 	for  this  are  that  the  Democratic  Kampuchea  Army  which  had  been  preserved  in  the
			mountair~  zones  has  begun  to  shake  the  areas  occupied  by  the  Vietnamese  forces  and
		 	Uecause  a  movement  towards  forming  a"Unified  Anti-Vietnam  Front"  nas  started  among
		 	the  Democratic  Kampuchean  forces,   	Prince  Sihanouk  and  former  Prime  Minister  Son
		 	Sann~    	However,   	one  also  cannot  overlook  the  fact  that,  as  with  the  Afghanistan
		 	iss~ie,   	the  shadow  of  the  Soviet  Union  has  begun  to  flicker,   	and  if  the  Third  World
		 	countries  fight  in  quest  of  "independence,"  and  are  victorious,   	right  afterwards
		 	the  Soviet  Union  will  enter  the  picture...hence  Kampuchea  is  becoming  a"focal
		 	point  of  modern  history."
 .
		 	This  report  by  the  journal.ist  Yoji  Tani  is  a  testimony  to  current  conditions,
		 	coming  from  Kampuchea....
		 	[Author's  report  begins]    	The  small  truck  that  picked  me  up  traveled  south  at  high
		 	speed  down  the  national  highway  along  the  Thai-Kampuchea.  border  from  the  bordertown
		 	Arany~Prathet.    	I  was  not  informed  where  we  would  cross  the  border,  nor  was  I  told
		 	where  I~vas  being  ta.ken.    	I  was  living  in  uncertainty  not  knowing  what  the  extent
		 	of  the  war  actually  was  in  the  forest  zone,  how  safe  it  was,  where  we  could  stay.
		 	At   	the  same  time,   	I  was  naturally  exhilarated  by  the  thought  that  aC  long  last   	I
		 	would  be  ahle  to  come  in  contact  with  soldiers  of  the  Democratic  Kampuchea  govern-
		 	ment  and   	the  people  of  the  liberated  areas  who  shared  their  fate.					     	,
		 	The  itivasion  and  occupation  by  Vietnam  that  has  continued  for  more  than  two  years,
 ,	     	and  the  Kampuchean  forces  that  are  resisting  these,--these  touch  my  own  feelings,
		 	since  in   	the  past  I  myself  supported  self-determination  for  the  Vietn anese  and  had
		 	spent  my  youth  in  anti-war  demonstrations.    	To  me,   	the  concerns  of  Kampuchea  were
		 	my  concerns.

			  	The  truck  has  apparently  veered  from  the  main  nation al  highway  to  a  side  road .
			  	It  runs  along   	the  bumpy  road  furiously  kicking  up  clouds  of  sand  and  rocks.    	Even
			  	tr,ough  it  is  high  noon  there  isn't  a  shadow  of  a  person  anywhere  around.    	It  was  a
			  	wi.erd  feeling.    	Something  lo~king  like  a  person's  shadow  appeared  in  my  f ield  of
			  	visio�i  z.n  the  thicket  up  ahead.    	The  truck  slowed  down.    	The  shadow  came  gradually
			  	c.loser.    	A  man  waved  his  hand,  making  some  kind  of  signal.    	I  guess  it  was  a
			  	soldier  of  the  Kampuchean  Army,     	.a  black  uniform  caked  with  dirt,  which  is  u~a~~ue
			  	to  .the  Khmer  people  wound  around  his  neck.
			  	The  truck  stopped  there.    	I  was  let  off  and  according  to  his  instructions,   	I  was
			  	order~~d   	to  step  through  a  thicket  about  a  man's  height.    	I  don't  know  how  many
			  	minut~~s  passed.    	I  came  to  a  river  about  ten  meters  wide.    	It  was  the  Thai-Kampu-
			  	chea  border.    	I  had  finally  made  it  to  Kampuchea..
			  	I  hadn't  noticed,   	but  when  we  began  to  cross  the  river,   	about  ten  Democratic
			  	Kampuchean  Army  troogs  appeared  on  the  side,  carrying  AK  rifles  on   	their  backs.
			  	I  was  relieved  to  see  among  them  the  smiling  f ace  of    	Lon -No  ~.in    	(age  38),   	a
			  	Foreign  Affairs  off icia.l  of  the  Democratic  Kampuchea  Government.    	Last  autumn  he
			  	had  visited  Japan  and  I  knew  his  face.    	He  is  fluent  in  English  and  was  to  serve  as
			  	my  host.																			    	~
			  	Again  we  entered   	the  thickets,   	shrubbery  are~s  and  thick  forest  and  walked  for
  -				about   	three  hours.    	We  finally  arrived  at  a  cleared  space  in  the  forest.    	There  were
			  	four  relatively  sturdy  buildings  thatched  with  grass,  and  in  the  opening  in  the
			  	r_enter  were  l~ng  hand-made  tables.
			  	"T'z.is  is  a  government  facility.    	We  will  ask  them  to  let  us  stay  here  two  or  three
			  	days,"    	No  Lin    	interpreted.    	This   	place,   	that  he  called  "headquarters"   	is  one  of
			  	the  base  areas  of   	the  Democratic  Kampuchea.  government  and  is  reportedly  used  on
			  	occasion  for  cabinet  meetin~s  by  government  leaders.
			  	The  ]liitf~lP.  wa5  cleared  for  50  meters  in  all  four  directions,  with  trenches  dug  in

			  	was   	told   	~hat  they  normally  accommo3ate  around  300  men  who  stay  here  on  an  alter-
			  	nating  basis.
			  	The  only  seasons  in  Kampuchea  are  the  rainy  season   	(May  through  September)  and   	the
			  	dry  season   	(October  to  April),   	and  there  is  no  "winter."    	There  are  about  tw o  weeks

			  	starting  out  from  the  "headquarters"  and  while  moving  through  the  jungle  came  upon
			  	se~~ral  "liberated  zones."    	Each  village  consisted  of  a  row  of  houses  on  a  river-
			  	bank  selected  because  there  was  water   	there.    	In  particular  there  were  villages
			  	concentrated  along  the  border,   	where.there  is  water  ev~en  in  the  dry  season.    	These
			  	places  were  probably  naturally  selected  for  the  waGer  and  because  it  is  possible

			Tlie   	iirst  "liberated   	zone"   	that  I  observed  was  a  spot  60  kilometers  southeast  of
			,~ranyapr.i~h~c    	in   	thc  jungle  a  few  kilometers  from  the  border.    	The   	setLtement  was
			reportedl~~  begun  there  when  they  escaped  into  the  jungle  during  the  first  Vietnam-
			ese   	invasion  in  1979.    	At   	that  time  they  felled   	trees,   	prepared   	the  land  and
			bui.lt  a  vill.age,   	but  many  people  died  without  food  or  medi.cine.
		 	Even  so,   	ther~  are  three  liberated  zones   	(homestead  villages)   	enclosing  the
		 	river,  and   	the  'house  in  each  are  high-floored  grass  thatched  homes  beautifully
		 	lined  up.    	I  heard  that  about  10,000  people  live  there,   	two   	thousand  of  whom
		 	apparently  had  returned  from  a  Thai  refugee  camp   	in  June  of  last   	year,   	and  some
		 	cc>mplained  "we  want  to  go  to  our  home  village  but  cannot,   	since  we  f ear   	the  Viet-
		 	namese."
		 	In  this  vicinity  there  apparently  are  a  considerable  number  of  "liberated  zones."
		 	However,   	for  these  liberated  zones,   	a  difference  remains  in  the  food  supply  situa-
		 	tion,   	between  the  villages  near  the  Thai  border   	that  receive  international  aid  and
		 	the  villages  from  which  it  is  necessary  to  make  a  2-1/2  day  round   	trip  walk  to
		 	get  sttch  aid.    	Apparently  representative  members  elected  by  their  respective  vil-
		 	la~e  ~c~o~le  have  been  working  very  hard   	to  eradicate  the  differences.   	The  differ-
		 	ence  is  particularly  evident  in  medical  facilities.    	It  is  common  f.or   	there  to  be  a
		 	lack  of  inedicine  everywhere,  but   	there  are   	some  hospitals  equipped  with  medical
		 	equipment   	through  the  International  Red  Cross,   	and  some  which  must  rely  on  primi-
		 	tive  treatment.
		 	In  every  village  hospital   	there  are  always  exhausted-looking  patients  stretched
		 	across  bamboo  beds.    	A  young  doctor  who   	says  that  he  received  medical  schoolin~  in
		 	Phnom  Penh   	pointed  out  "lack  of  nutrition  brings  on  disease  and  delays  recovery";
		 	while  a  doctor  in  another  village  related  "In  the  places  here  that  people  have
		  	esca  ped  to,   	there  are  no  wards,   	so  they  have  to  sleep  on  the  ground  and  every  day
  -			tens  of  people  die  off."    	These  words  matcn  the  conditions  that  I  heard  about  in
		  	the  Thai  refugee  camps,   	and  I  have  no  reason  to  doubt  them,
		  	I  remember  that  Prime  ttinister  Samphan  once  told  the  world  that  this  was  a"battle
		  	for  continuation  of   	the  race    	against  the  starvation  strategy  of  the  Vietnamese
		  	forces,   	but  the  jun~le  was  really  a  hell  for  them.    	The  number  of   	ill  persons
		  	reportedly  increases  threefold   	in  the  rainy  season.    	Rven  so,   	it  appeared  that
		  	efforts  were  being  made  to  build  new  wards  and  train  nurses  in  each  village.
		  	There  are  schools  in  every  villa~e  in  the  "liberated  zone"    	and   	it  was  apparent
		  	that  eEforts  were  being  expanded  on  educatian  of   	the  childrer:.    	Since  there  were
		  	no  textbooks  or  stationery,   	they  followed   	the  method  of  learnin~  by  raising  their.
		  	vo~ces  according  to  the  teacher's  instruction,   	facing  a  hand-made  black~~ard;  Yrut
		  	the  faces  of   	teachers  and  students  alike  were  serious.    	The  subjects  taught  are
  -			Kampucheail,   	arithmetic  and  music,  but  high  school  students  are  also  taught  politi-

			  	returned  to  a  peaceful  state--at  times  they  erect  stages  in  each  village,   	put  on
			  	dramas  and  folk  dances  using  hand-made  musicdl  instruments.
			  	A  f e~a  days  later  I  observed  a  village  meeting  at  which  I  was  able  to  see  clearly
			   	the  bond  between  the  Democratic  Kampuchea  Government  and  its  people.    	Scanning  the
			  	village  square  I  could  see  2000  people,  who    	enthusiastically  2pplauded  the  speeches
			  	of   	the  government  and  villa~e  representatives  that  were  delivered  over  loud-
			  	speakers.    	Their  spirits  were  raised  by  shouting  in  chorus  "The  Democratic  Kampu-
  -				chean  Army  and  the  People  Forever"  and  "Down  with  the  Vietnamese  Invaders."
			  	The  meeting  on  that  day  was  to  celebrate  victory  in  battle  in  the  Phnum  Malai
			  	Mountains   	(an  area  in  northwest  Kampuchea).    	It  communicated  to  the  villagers  the
			  	state  cf  development  and  the  significance  of  the  unified  front  being  promoted  by
			  	the  government.    	The  meetinfi  stimulated  people  to  cooperate  in  a  spirit  of  democracy
			  	and  harmony,   	to  improve  and   	elevate  life  in  the  liberated  villages.
			  	Such  meetings  apparently  are  held  from  time  to  time  in  the  "liberated  areas."    	As
			  	far  aG  I  could  see  in  Battamban  Province,  which  I  had  penetrated,   	there  was  a  con-
			  	siderable  number  of  people  who  shared  their  fate  with  the  Pol  Pot  army  and  were
			  	~~~aitin,c,  out  the  withdrawal  of  the  Vietnamese  forces.    	I  don't  have  accurate  figures,
			  	but  accordinp  to  estima.tes  of  the  Thai  military,   	the  number  of  Kampucheans  living
			  	in  the  border  areas  is  430,000.    	The  population  in  regions  dominated  by  Democratic
  ,				Kampuchea,   	according  to  its  own  figures,   	is  150,000.
			  	The  people  in  the  "liberated "  areas  have  planted  vegetables  and  corn  in  the
			  	fi.elds,  and  bananas  and  papayas  around  the  f ields.    	The  latter  are  apparently
			  	consumed  not  as  fruits  but  as  veg~tables,  and  while  they  rely  on  rice  supplied
			  	through  international  aid,   	I  was  impressed  with  the  vitality  of  their  efforts  to
			  	be  self-suf.ficient.
			  	A  f eature  which  distinguishes  these  people  frAm  those  in  the  Thai  refugee  camps
			  	is  rheir.  ~el.f-revitali.zation  and  their  planned  village  construction.    	However,

			  	of   	tl~e  Vi~tna^~~se  soldiers  and  government  oppression.    	However,   	the  Democratic

			  	rather  tY~an  increasing  the  population  in  the  jungle,  wherP  food  is  in  short  supply,

			A  feca  days  later  I  resolved   	to  ascertain  what  Prim2  Minister  Samphan  calis  the

			Foreign  Office  official,   	No  Lin  told  me  "It  takes  five  days  round  trip  to  the
			heavv  fightin~,   	and  there  is  no  water  along  the  way,"  but  he  apparentl}   	contacted
			the  front  regimental  comn:ander    	Nikho~r    	and  brought  me  an  "OK"  to  go  to  the  front.
			I  was  prepared   	for  a  rigorous  march  and  was  firmly  resolved  to  face  d~nger,   	since
			if   	I  hadn't  done  so,  my  trip  all  the  way  from  Jap,sn  would  have  been  a~waste.
			On  the  first  morning,  an  elephant  was  prepared  from  the  base  area~.    	?C  was  mounted
			on  one  and   	I  headed  east   	into  the  jungle  accompanied  by  abotit  fifty  soldiers.
			The  speed  of   	the  eleptiant  making  wide  strides  is  equi.valent  to  that  of.  a  person
			walking  fast.   	Even  so,   	no  matter  how  much  we  traUeled,   	there  was  no  end  to  it
			[�Iith  a  noon  break  sandwiched  in  between,   	the  journey  extended  to  nine  hours  and  by
			night  fall  we  ar.rived  at  a  supply  base  to  the  front  lines.
			Great  masses  of   	soldiers  were  camped  as  if  drawn  ir~to   	the  jungle  on  both  sides
			of   	the  road,   	caith  a  considerable  number  of  women  amcyn,g  the  supp'ly  unit.    	It  was  a
			noisy  spectacle,   	like  a  colony  of  sparrows.
			tde  ~.~ere  to  camp   	together  with  them.    	In  the  surroundin~;  jungle,   	it  is  reported
		 	that   	there  are  places    	where  large  quantities  of  weapo~5  and  ammunition  were  buried
			at   	the  beginning  of   	1978  in  anticipation  of  a  Vietnamese  ~ffensive.    	It  is  said
		 	tha*_   	these  are  dug  up  and  used  in  attacks,   	but  apparently  there  exist  a  lot  of
			weapons  lost  when  those  responsible  for  burying  them  died  in  battle.    	Mines  have
			been  placed  around  them,   	so  as  long  as  there  are  no  surviving  members  to  serve  as
			guides   	to   	their  location,   	they  cannot  easily  be  found.
			The  meal   	that  had  been  prepared  for  us  consisted  of  stir  fried  vegetables  with
			chicken,   	and   	soup.    	The  rice  was  reportedly  bought  fro~  T~ai.].and  with  currency
			provided  by  aid   	Fr~r,~  a  Friendly  country.    	The  rice  grains  were  dry  and  meal  was
			not  delicious  to  me  so  I  ate  it  by  pourin~  the  soup  ove.r  ik  and  drinking  it.    	I
  _	     	suddenly  noticed  d  group  of  four  or  five  people  neckin,~  at  the  rice  in  their  pot,
			and  was  embarrassed  to  discover  that  the  only  thin,gs  that  they  ate  with  it  were
		 	powdered  f ish  and  salt.
			The  night  soldiers  were  sleeping  like  insects,   	hanging  in  t~ieir  ha~:unocks.    	Also,
		 	some  so?.3iers  were  si.tting  around  the  campfire  listening  to  folk  music  and  news  on
		 	portable   	(Japanese  made)  radios  reporting  the  r~sults  of  battles  from  each  area,
		 	since  even  in   	the  jungle  broadcasts  of  Democratic  Kampuchea  could  be  heard  very		  	~
			well.
		 	It   	is  rumored   	that  the  broadcasts  origina'te  from  a  transmitter  placed  in  Yunnan

			 	their  way  to  the  front  as  replacements  joined  in,   	so  suddenly  the  size  of  the
			 	Kamp~ichean  troops  swelled  considerably.  For  myself,  who  was  born  right  after  World
			 	j~lar   	II,   	there  was  no  way  of  knowing  the  feelings  of  these  young  soldiers  who  might
  -		     	di~  on  the  battlefields,  but  the  appearance  of   	these  young  troops  silently  march-
			 	ing  o.i,  with  AK  rifles  and  anti-tank  guns  on  their  shoulders  was  truly  majestic.
			 	After  coming  this  far,   	I  reali;;ed  that  it  was  not  only  men  who  were  fighting
			 	against  the  Vietnamese  troops.    	This  is  because  I  encountered  even  young  women
			 	car:ying  ammunition  or  rice  on  their  heads  while  gritting  their  teeth,  w~lking
  _		     	in  f~_le  on  the  long  journey  to  the  front.    	The  women  in  the  supply  unit  accompan-
			 	ied  tne  soldiers,   	just  as  the  combat  nurses  did,   	and  supported  the  Bemocratic
			 	Kamouchean  forces  in  the  rear.
			 	k'e  suddenly  stopped  while  I  was  marching  along  lost  in  thought,   	and  the  command
			 	came  "We  will  camp  here  for  the  night."    	I  was  told  that  this  place  was  about  15
			 	lcilometers  before  reaching  the  village  called  Takon  where  12~0  Vietnamese  were
			  	reoorted]y  building  a  camp.  When  I  settled  into  the  spot  indicated  to  me,  at  the
			 	camping  point,   	two  or  three  soldiers  who  were  on  the  side  began  suddenly  to  dig
			 	holes.    	i,Then  I  stood  up  I  was  told  soaething  that  meant  "if  a  fire  fight  breaks
			 	out  please  get  in  this  hole."    	I  spent  a  sleepless  night  laying  next  ~o  that  hole.
			  	I  reached  the  attack  zone  on  the  front  the  next  day,  which  was  the  third  day  of  the
			 	marct~.    	It  was  five  kilometers  this  side	 	T'lkon.	 	On  this  day,   	on  the  way,   	I
			 	heard  that  we  passed  through  a  camp  abandone�'   	by~the  Vietnamesa  in  retreat  and  that
			  	the  F.ampuchean  forces  had  been  ma.king  sporadic  attacks  twice  a  day  for  the.past
			  	two  caeeks  in  order  to  keep  up  the  pressure.
			  	The  attack  on  this  day  was  one  of  these.    	When  radio  c~ntact  was  made  with  units
			  	on  three  sides  who  had  sneaked  up  as  closP  as  possible  to    	Takon    	an  all-out
			  	attack  began,   	coordinated  with  the  signal  from  big  guns.    	107mm  mortars  spewed  forth
			  	fire  and  the  enemy  was  attacked  by  these,  and  by  75mm  mortars  that  boomed  out.   	The
			  	quick  maneuverinQ  of  the  F~ampuchean  soldiers,   	the  impact  of  the  rockets...I  dis-
			 	covered  that  I  was  tense  with  fascination.    	Shortly,   	I  was  warned  of  the  danger  of
			 	a  counterattack  by  the  Vietnamese  and  was  ordered  to  retreat,   	but  the  mortar  attack
			  	contin~ied  for  about  one  hour.
			 	Later   	I  noticed  that  the  radio  broadcast  that  the  "Vietnamese  camp  on  National
			  	Rcute  5  had  b~en  brought  under  control  through  a  fierce  attack  by  Kampuchean  f.or-

			at  0  la  hon.    	The  next  day  I  set  out  for  the  field,  dragging  my  c~rn-blist~~ed
			feet.
			The  route   	to  0  la  hon  was  narrow  and  there  were  more  mountain  passes  ~har~  1
			expected,   	added  to  which  there  was  the  danger  of  mines.    	I  therefnr~  skarted  the
			trail  and  walked  where  there  was  no  road,   	and  finally  arrived  at  ~the  are.a  totally
			e:~hausted .
			The  Vietnamese  base  at  0  la  hon  was  on  a  high  point  with  a  commanding  view.    	The
			jungle  was  cut  away  on  all  four  sides  for  about  300  meters  but  the  camp  struc*Lres
			themselves  ~aere  scattered  abouey   	probably  as  preparatio~  aga~nst  atta~ck.    	Deep
			ditciles  ~aere  dug  around  each  building,  and  there  were  many  tr~ncfi~es  deliberately
		 	censtructed  by  ditches  with  logs  and  dirt  piled  on  top,   	an~l  I~4ould  see  why  the
			Vietnamese  forces  had  been  several  times  stronger  than  th~e  Ka~~~c~~hean  side.
		 	Scattered  about  were  ammunition,  Vietnamese  army  cay~sn  anu  coo~Cing  utensils  testi-
		 	fying   	to   	the  horror  of  war,  but  what  really  surprised.  m~  was  the  large  number  of
		 	empty  cans  of  Japanese  goods  scattered  about,   	designed  with  th~e  "Rising  Sun"  and
		 	"P~ount  Fuji."
		 	To  the  best  of  my  knowledge,   	the  Japanese  government  sent  to  Phnom  Penh  as  aid
		 	canned  goods  worth  800  million  yen  through  UN  organizations.    	However,   	it  is  re-
		 	~orted  that  some  of  ttiese  ended  up  on  the  black  mark~t  in  Vietnam,   	and  here  we  have
		 	confirmation  that  they  were  brought  by  the  Vietnamese  up  to  the  front  lines.
		 	In  a  granary  built  by  the  Vietnamese  about  three  b~gs  of  rice  still  remained.
		 	Thinking   	it  was  precious  booty,  when  I  pointed  it  out  to  a  soldier  with  whom  I
		 	had  become  friendly,   	he  fro4med  and  shook  his  k?ead  "No."  It  turned  out  that  the
		 	Vietr.amese  may  l:avc  pcisoned   	it,   	so  on  no  occasion  Should  it  be  eaten.    	Up  to  this
		 	time,   	there  had  been  cases  of  people  dying  fratn  dri~iking  water  that  they  did  not
		 	know  the  retreating  Vietnamese  had  poisoned,   	and  cases  of  mass  dysentery,   	so  the
		  	troops  were  very  serious  about  such  "booty."
		  	(Hopu)   	(ag~  27)   	the  commander  of  the  0  la  hon  district,   	described  the  battle  to
		  	drive  out   	the  Vietnamese.    	"In  the  first  week,   	we  wore  down  the  enemy  by  surprise
		  	attacks,   	finally  went  around  behind  them,   	cut  off  their  supplq  route  and  maue  a
		  	concentrated  attack  from  three  sides  in  the  jungle."    	He  said  they  also  concealed
		  	themselves  along  the  retreat  route  and  fired  at  the  retreating  Vietizamese.    	He
		  	added  "It  is  an  iron  rule  of  diversionary  warfare  for  a  company  to  wine  out  a
		  	regiment  and  r~~ute  the  enemy  without  making  any  sacrifices."

			   	near  the  supply  base  at  0-Chareu  on  the  ~'ietnamese  forces'   	side  for  the  attack  on

			   	fighting  spirits  of   	the  Kampucheans  i~  high.    	It  is  reported  that  the  fierce
			   	attack  on  the  Vietnamese  last  December  was  especially  terrible.
			   	I  hea;-d  the  following  evidence  about  the  situation  at  that  time.    	"Tne  Vietna.mese
			   	forces  poured  soldiers  drafted  in  the  south  into  the  fighting  like  human  bullets.
			   	The  I:ampuchean  forces  made  repea.t~3  surprise  attacks  on  them  from  the  jungle  and
			   	wiped   	them  out..    	The  roa~i  going  from  Q-Chareu  to  Phnt:m  M:ilai  wa~  covered  with  the
			   	corpses  of  VietnaL~ese  soldiers."    	The  number  of  Vietnamese  soldiers  that  died  in
			   	battle  on  that  road,  which  is  now  nicknamed  "Cemet~ry  Road"  reached  1,400  according
			   	to  Kampuchean  reports.
			   	I  had  an  unexpected  meeting  in  the  liberated  zone  iiear  Fhnum  Malai.    	It  was  the  son
			   	of  Prinr.e  Sihanouk  who  has  been  in  the  public  eye  regarding  the  issue  of  an  Anti-
			   	Vietnamese  Unified  Front.    	Iiis  son,  Norodom  Narindarapon   	(age  26),  returneci  from
			   	France  last  December.    	I  had  dinner  with  him,  and  he  related  to  me  the  following.
			   	"I  am  a  Buddhist,  but  feeling  that  I;aanted  to  fu~f:tll  a  political  role  to  do  some-
			   	thing  to  solidify  the  people  against  Vietnam,   	I  returned  home  to  answer  to  the  call
			   	For  a  unified  front.    	I  have  seen  the  bra~re  posture  of  the  soldiers  on  the  battle-
			   	field,   	and  would  like  to  under~o  military  training  myself,   	if  possible.    	I  cannot
			   	believe  that  my  father  could  retire  f'rom  politics.    	Now,  when  it   	is  necessary  to
			   	save  our  country  from  invasion,   	I  hope  that  he  will  join  us  in  the  Ethnic  Patriotic
			   	Front  that  the  government  is  calling  for.
			   	This  "liberated  area"  appears  to  be.  a  window  for  diplomacy  opened  by  the  Democratic
			   	Ka.mpuchean  Government  towards  Thailand,  and  visitors  from  foreign  co~.~ntries  are
			   	apparently  generally  received  here.    	Near  here  there  is  an  advanced  form  of
			   	liberated  area  vi~lage  called  a"new  village,~'  in  which  efforts  have  been  expended
			   	to  improve  ttie  environment,   	and  is  being  used  as  a  model  for  other  "homestead
			   	villages."    	Ic  is  about  three  kilometers  from  this  liberated  area  to  Phnum  Malai.
			   	I  could   	thus  well  understand  why  Kampuchea  defended   	it  "to  the  death."
			   	I  must  report  `hat    	here  I  also  met  with  Prime  Minister  Khieu  Samphan.    	The  cabinet
			   	that  accompanied   	the  Prime  Minister  included  Secretary  General  Khet  Chhon  and
			   	Social  Welfare  Minister   	Ieng  Thirith.    	These  important  people  appeared  out  of   	the
			   	bl~~e,   	and  when  the  interview.was  over  they  again  disappeared  into  the  jungle.    	I
			   	11~.~_=  ~io   	:idea  ;ahere  the  facilities  for  the  high  ranking  cadre  are  located.    	They
			   	are  probably  moved  about  ~onstantly  in  the  jung7e.
			  	However.,   	in  December  1979,   	I  heard  that  when  a  delegation  of  Japanese  newsmen  met
			  	with  Pol  Pot  at  a  base  area  in  Northern  Kampuchea,   	they  crossed  the  border  under
			   	cover  of  night  and  were  led  to  the  meeting  place  in  blindfolds,  but  I  could  now
			  	unuerstand  the  expression  of  their  confidence  in  the  "liberated  areas"  and   	the
 _			 	change  in  the  war  situation  from  my  interview  with  these  officials.

			My  interview  with  Khieu  Samphan  lasted  from  4  pm  to  9  pm  with  dinner   	in  between.
		 	The  Prime  ?~iinister,  who  served  as  Minister  of  Trade  during  Sihanoulc's  regime  is
		 	known  as  the  only  person  in  the  cabinet  at   	that  time  who  rode  to  w~rk  on  his
		 	bicycle.    	Perhaps  because  of  his  present  ord~al,  he  had  much  more  white  hair
		 	than  he  did  in  his   	(earlier)  photographs.
		 	The  dauntless  f.ace  of   	the  Prime  rtinister  who,   	in  his  younger  days  studied  Marxism
		 	iil  France,  as  had  former  Prime  Minister  Pol  Pot,  who  now  occupies  the  position  of
		 	highe~t  military  commander,  appeared  even  to  ~ef lect  the  mentality  of.   	this  country,
		 	although  I  heard  that  he  has  a  li~ht  case  of  malaria.    	He  answered  each  of  my
		 	questions  crisply,   	to  the  point  and  with  clarity.    	Here  I  will  present  only  the
		 	characteristics  of   	the  war  situation  as  the  Prime  Minister  related  them  to  me..
		 	Prime  Minister  Samphan  and  his  party,  filled  with  cotif idence  explained:    	"In  1979
		 	when  the  Vietnamese  invaded,  we  were  forced   	into  a  bitter  struggle,  with  a  dead-
 -	     	loclc  state  continuing  into  1980,    	The  two  years  up  to  now  we  were  in  a  defensive
		 	posture,  but  the  war   	situation  now  has  taken  a  dramatic  and  favorable  turn  and  our
		 	forces  are  no~a  on  the  offensive  in  each  area."    	Their  analysis  as  to  the  cause
		 	behind   	the  change  in  conditions  was   	~1)   	lowering  of  f ighting  spirit  of  Vietnamese
		 	troops,   	(2)   	the  military  strength  of  the  Vietnamese  forces  had  reached  its  ceiling,
		 	and   	(3)   	supply  has  become  difficult  owing  to  the  economic  collapse  inside  of  Vietnam.
		 	Dlext,   	in  regard  to  how  the  people  are  accepting  the  war  as  a  resistance  to  invasion,
		  	they  told  me,  showing  con.siderable  power,   	that  "At  the  time,   	in   	'79,   	there  were
		 	people  with  various  ideas,  but  those  who  were  fighting  against  the  invasion  were
		 	Kampuchean  government  forces,   	and  support  for  them  has  spread  widely  through  their
		 	results  in  combat  and  through  political  knowledge."    	They  also  said  that  even
		  	though  the  Prime  Minister  is  in  the  jungle,   	he  knows  the  situation  throughout  the
		 	country  in  cons~derable  detail.
  ~			"Those  who  support  the  Vietnamese  troops  amount  to  only  one  percent  of  the  popula-
		  	tioii   	(60,000,  assuming  a  population  of  6,000,000?).    	Even  among  the  vigilante
		  	groups  that  they  established,   	there  are  some  who  will  harbor  political  officials
		  	and   	poor  farmers  will  offer  supplies  to  the  guerrillas,   	so  that  in  some  fuxm  they
		  	can  maintain  relations  with  the  people."
		  	Later,  when  I  asked  a[~lestern  correspondent   	in  Bangkok  how  he  perceived   	these  facts,
		  	I  was  able  to  hear  an  interesting  explanation  that  was  quite  similar,    	"Heng
		  	Samrin's  regime  is  just  a  billboard  for  the  Vietnamese,  and  his  so-aalled  arm~  has
		  	practically  no  fighting  men.    	It  is  not  appropriate  to  think  that   	they  are  fighting
 -			together,  rather   	they  serve  as  guides  for  the  Vietnamese  troops."
		  	"~'ietnamese  officials  have  been  assigned  even  to  the  rural  ~~illages,   	but  the
		  	vigilante  groups  have  been  organized  actually  in  order  to  expose  people  opposed  to
  _			the  Vietnu~-~ese,   	and  sympathizers  with  the  Democratic  Kampuchean  forces."
		  	There  are  people  who  walk  for  several  days  from  inside  the  cauntry  to  the  Thai-
		  	Kampuchea  border  to  receive  supplies  from  international  aid.    	It  is  through  the
		  	mouths  of  such  people  that~one  gets  a  vague  pro�ile  of  what  is  going  on  inside  of
  -			Kampuchea,   	one  that   	is  different  f.rom  that  shown  to  foreigners.

   	_		     	Frime  Minister  Samphan  co~.tinued  "Vietnam  has  sent  250,000  troops  and   	50,000
			 	~overnment  oificials  into  Kampuchea,  but  they  have  complete  control  of  only  one
			 	area,   	and  p,uerrilla  warfare  is  continuing  sporadically  throughout  the  country."
			 	Also,   	regarding  the  strength  of  the  present  Democratic  Kampuchean  Army,  he  ex~
			 	plained  "There  are  6~,~OU  regular  troops   	(~he  Thai  Army  estimate  is  40,000).   	In
			 	addit.ion,   	there  are  70,000  guerrillas"  and  he  reported  "The  scale  is  expanding  even
  _		     	more,   	since  we  have  volunteers.
			 	P.ecent.ly,   	it  became  evident  that  increasing  numbers  of  Vietnamese  who  were  sent
			 	into   	the  invasion  of  Kampuchea  fear  dying  in  the  jungles  of  a  strange  land  and  have
			 	been  deserting  into  Thai  territory.    	It  seemed  perfectly  natural  to  me  that  the
  _		     	~~ietnamese  soldiers,   	constantly  harrassed  by  surprise  attacks,  would  lose  their
			 	wiil   	to  fi~ht  in  a  senseless  war  that  is  being  protracted.    	Even  in  Battamban    	~
			 	Pro~~ince  that  I  had  infiltrated  into  the  jungles  cover  a  vast  area  and  ones  range
			 	of  vision  at  best  is  ten  meters.    	No  matter  how  strong  the  Vietnamese  may  be,   	it  is
			 	next  ta  impossible  to  stamp  out  the  guerrillas  who  know  how  to  survive  the  jungle
			  	labyrinth,   	just  as  the  U.S.   	forces  were  unable  to  deal  with  the  Vi~at  Cong.    	As  for
			  	the  recent  strategy  of   	the  Vietnamese,   	it  appears  that  they  have  already  given  up
			 	on  advancing  into  mountain  re$ions,  perhaps  because  they  have  realized  they  have
			 	had  more  victims  than  successes,   	or  because  they  lure  the  enemy  ir.to  the  f latlands
			 	and  wipe  them  out  there.    	At  the  same  time,   	it  is  saf e  to  say  that  one  f eature  of
			  	the  Kampuchean  situation  these  days  is  that  the  Kampuchean  forces  are  waging  fierce
			 	attacl:s  on  the  Vietnamese  bases  that  have  been  stretched  out  across  the  flatlands.

			 	Noca  let  mc~  discuss  the  sober  aspects  of  the  soldiers  of  the  Democratic  Kampuchean
			 	P.rmy,   	the  former  soldiers  of  Pol  Pot.    	This  may  be  a  sub~ective  opinion,  but  the
			  	impression  I  got  from  dir~ct  contact  with  them  was  not  the  "cruel,  unjust  gang"
			 	reported  in  the  meuia  i;~  Japan.    	Rather  they  are  a  group  of  simple  young  people  with
			  	surprisingly  high  moral  standards.
			 	iia1F  oP  the  soldier.s  are  18  to  25  years  old,  and  many  come  from  poor  farmer  house-
			 	hul~ls,    	l,izat  is  striking  about  such  young  soldiers  is  that  they  become  separated
			  	fro:~  the  real  f.ighting  men  wh2n  they  get  married,   	and  that  in  Kampuchea,  where  the
			 	avera~e  life  span  has  been  about  45   	years,   	at  the  same  time,   	in  Third  World  coun-

		 	life  was  carried  on  at  the  squad  level.    	There  were  no  orders  or  commands,   	and
		 	perhaps  because  they  had  been  tempered  in  the  many  diversionary  actions  where  they
		 	had  to  act  according   	to  their  own  jur',gment,   	it  was  unusual  to  see  how  disciplined
		 	they  actua lly  were.
		 	There  caere  fixed  military  rules  among  the  soldiers.    	For  example,   	"one  must  not
		 	deprive  the  people  of  even  one  grain  of  rice,"  in  order  to  prevent  soldiers  armed
		 	with  rifles  from  shooting,    	"There    	must  be  no  arguments  among  the  troops,"  and
		 	to  guard  against  moral  degeneration  there  was  a  rule  between  men  and  women  "women
		 	must  not  be  teased."
		  	Such  discipline  in  the  Kampuchean  forces  was  a  legacy  from  the  time  of  the  fi;ht
		 	against  tre  Americans  and  apparently  it  now  permeates  them  in  the  war  against   	the
		 	Vietnamese.   	As  far  as  I  could  see  in  their  living  and  in  their  marches,   	conversation
		 	betcaeen  the  sexes  was  modest,   	and  at  night  no  one  ever  approached   	the  women's
		  	camp.    	I  was  repeatedly  struck  by  the  kindness  among  people:    	lending  one  of  one's
		  	sandals  to  a  barefoot  person,   	showing  care  to  those  with  malaria,   	and  the  like.
		 	As   	I  discovered  when  I  learned   	that  an  older  man  dressed  in  simple  farmers'   	clothes
		  	and   	straw  sandals  was  Regimental  Commander  Nikhom  later  assigned   	to  defend
		  	]3attambang  Province,   	my  honest  impression  was  that  the  Democratic  Kampuchean  Army
		  	in  a  country  where  90  percent  of   	the  population  are  farmers  was  none  oth~er  than  an
  _			"army  of   	farmers,"  and  the  commanding  officers  in  each  area  were  "good  natured
		  	peasants."
 _			The  Cambodian  Conflict  rtust  Be  Reported  from  the  Standpoint  of  the  Side  Being
		  	Invaded
		  	To   	the  Japanese,   	the  term  "Cambodian  Army"  raises  a  dark.image.    	This  is  because
		  	it   	inevitably  re~niiids  them  of  the  "atrocity  problem."    	Therefore  in  Japanese  public
		  	opinion,   	there  are  many  who  say  "Of  course,   	the  Vietnamese  were  wrong  to  invade
		  	(Cambodia),   	but  the  Cambodians  themselves   	(Pol  Pot's  army)  were  also  cruel."    	But
		  	if.  we  take  the  position  "The  invaders  are  wrong  and  so  are  the  invaded,"  what  can
  -			the  people  of   	the  small  country  of  Kampuchea  hold  on  to  in  order  to  survive?
		  	Isn't   	the  current  Kampuchean  problem  one  of  resistance  to  the  independence  of  a
		  	small  country  being  swallowed  up  by  the  military  might  of  a  large  one   	(Vietnam)?
		  	After   	the  Americans  left  Indochina,   	the  Soviet  Union  is  supporting  Vietnam  in  order
		  	to  encroach  upon  Southeast  Asia,   	and  didn't  this  same  Vietnam  invade  the  small
		  	country  of  Kampuchea   	in  order  to  swallow  it  up?
		  	If  we  follow  the  thesis  of   	the  Shoichi  Honda  school  of  journalism  that  taught  us
		  	that  ''the  issues  must  be  examined  from  the  side  of  those  being  invaded"  during  the
		  	Vietnam  co~:flict,   	two   	prerequisite  conditions  are  missing  in  reports  on  Kampuchea
		  	up  to   	the  present  time.    	One  is  that  the  Democratic    	Government  of  Kampuchea,   	which
		  	was  founded  in  1975  by  evading  the  struggle  for  ethnic  liberation,  was  under  con-
		  	ditions  of   	economic  hardship  that  were  more  severe  than  those  of  Vietnam.    	The
		  	scale  of   	the  bombing  raids  by  American  forces  was  not  the  same  ratio  as  in  Vietnam
		  	for  example  the  all-out  bombing  of  the  entire  country  for  200  days  in  succession
		  	brought  destruction  unprecedented  in  the  history  of  this  small  nation.

  .				One  other  factor  was  that   	the  Kampucheans  were  also  fated  to  deal  with  ethnic
			   	liberation,   	i.e,  at  the  same  time  as  they  were  liberated,   	they  rad  to  deal  with
			  	Vietnam's  policy  of  incorporation   	(the  plan  for  an  "Indochina  Federation").
			  	Japanese  think  that  the  invasion  of  Kampuchea  was  a  sudden  blitzkrieg,  but  this
			   	is  n~~t  so.   	Until  the  large-scale  invasion  by  the  Vietnamese  at  the  end  of  1978,
			  	various  schemes  were  carried  out  to  overthrow  the  regime  of  Pol  Pot,  who  would
  -				not  agree  to  the  "Indochina  Federation"  being  advocated  by  Vietnam.    	The  idea  was
  ~				similar  to  the  Soviet  principle  of  limitation  and  was  intended  to  bring  the  mili-
			   	tary  forces  of  Laos  and  Cambodia  under  the  d~:rection  of  the  Vietnamese.
			  	The  Kampucheans  chose  to  advocate  non-alliar.ce  and  neutrality,  and  follow  a  course
			  	of  independ~nce  separate  from  Laos  not  because  of~an  ethnic  confrontation,  but  be-
			  	cause  there  was  an  undercurrent  of.  self-reliance,  a  desire  not  to  entrust  again
			  	the  liberation  gained  by  the  flow  of  blood,   	to  the  dominati~n  of  a  neighboring
			  	country.    	The  border  confl~ict   	that  broke  out  soon  after  liberation  was  not  an  issue
			  	as  to  who  was  the  aggressor.    	It  was  nothing  than  a  political  confrontation  and
			  	political  discord  over  whether  to  be  subordinated  to  Vietnamese  control  or  follow
			  	the  pa~h  o~   	independence,   	taking  th~  form  of  a  border  conflict.
			  	Insicie  Kampuchea,   	as  the  Vietnam  facticns  were  purged  and  operations  designed  to
			  	overthrow  the  government  ended  in  failure,   	it  was  decided  to  throw  the  Vietnamese
			  	Tank  Corps  into  an  all-onr  offensive  as  a  means  of  last  resort.    	The  Heng  Samrin
			  	regime  was  set  up  one  month  prior  to  the  offensive,    	It  was  a  mere  "decoration"
			  	desi~ned   	to  hide  the  Vietnamese  aggression  from  the  eyes  of  the  world.	  	~
			  	At   	the  center  of  the  Cambodian  "atrocity  issue"  are  punishment  of  the  Vietnam
			  	faction  cluring  the  turmoil  and  unrest  right  after  independence,   	and  instances  of
			  	bloodshed  that  took  place  as  retributions  against  members  of  the  old  regime  and  the
			  	Vietnam  faction  at  *_he  loc:31  level.    	Of  course,   	there  were  many  deaths  from
			  	starvation  and  disease,  but  they  do  not  exceed  the  number  of  deaths  in  societies
			  	after  revolutions  that  have  occurred  up  to  the  present--a  fact  which  is  gradually
			  	becoming  apparznt.
			  	I   	thir~lc  it  is  necessary  to  focus  attention  on  the  fact  that  the  source  of   	the  "mass
  .				atrocitv   	iss~~e"  is  Ji.etnam,   	the  country  that  was  the  ag,gressor  at  the  time.    	Just
			  	bec.~~~se  piles  of  bones  were  shown  in  the  environs  of  Phnom  Penh  that  was  under
			  	Vietnamese  control  at   	the   	time  does  not  a11ow  us  to  ~ud~e  whether  these  resulted
			  	from  atroci.tie~,   	illness,   	or  starvation.    	Burial  of  the  dead  after  liberation
			  	changed   	Erom  individual  to  mass  graves,   	and  if  they  were  disinterred,   	any  number
			  	ot  human  bones  could  be  dug  up.
			  	Ts   	~.t   	t~:,o  far-fetr_hed   	to  think  that  it  was  only  na.tural  for  them  to  set  these  up
			  	as   	''places  of  atrocity"  and  show  them  to  foreign  newsmen?    	(Even  if  these  were
			  	"gr:~a*  at;-ocities,"  this  xs  for  the  Kampucheans,  not  the  Vietnamese,   	to  judge.)
			  	These  words  keenly  represent  the  anger  of  the  Kampucheans  on  this  issue.
			 	Another  Kampuchean  has  said  that  Vietnam,  which  has  tens  of  thousands  of  boat
 _				pecple  abandoning  their  homeland,   	is  not  qualified  to  judge  Kampuchea.    	It  is  more

		 	hardships  and  tragedies  continue  to  plague  the  many  refugees  and  people  in  the

		 	Regarding  the  "mass  atrocity   	issue,"  Prime  Piinister  Samphan  openly  acknowled~;ed
