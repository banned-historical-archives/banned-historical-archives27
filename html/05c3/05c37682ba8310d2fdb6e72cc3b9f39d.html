HIGHLIGHTS 
Chinese Communist forces have, by successfully 
containing all the effective Nationalist units south of 
Ilsuchou, virtually finished the battle for Central China 
While the Communist armies pause momentarily along 
the north bank of the Yangtze River in order to regroup 
and resupply, the Nationalist military offices in Nanking 
are beset with despondency and confusion (see page 10). 
Nationalist political leaders are similarly afflicted with 
despair and uncertainty and apparently have not made any 
systematic plans for the removal of the Government fol-
lowing the loss of Nanking. 
The firm intention of the Netherlands Government 
to proceed unilaterally in the establishment of an interim 
government for all Indonesia has been deflected, at least 
temporarily, by the conciliatory letter recently addressed 
by Indonesian Premier Hatta to the UN Good Offices Com-
mittee (see page 11). Meanwhile, the Indonesian Republic 
is continuing its efforts to win both domestic and foreign 
support for an eventual showdown with the Dutch. 
In Moscow, the Kremlin is currently holding dis-
cussions with Satellite economic delegates in what appears 
to be an effort to bolster Satellite economies under increased 
Soviet control (see page 5). The serious deterioration of the 
vital Czechoslovak economy has largely prompted the hold-
ing of the conferences at this time.

WESTERN EUROPE 
GERMANY 
Soviet Withdrawal Although the USSIVin the near future may 
officially propose quadripartite withdrawal 
from Germany, such a proposal would be primarily for propa-
ganda purposes in view of the still inadequate Communist control 
over eastern Germany. Soviet propaganda has persistently ad-
vocated such a withdrawal since the Warsaw Conference in 
May, and the Kremlin may now wish to strengthen this propa-
ganda campaign with an official proposal. Meanwhile, the USSR 
has created the framework for an eastern German state and 
has hinted that after its recognition the USSR would sign a sep-
arate peace treaty involving a partial withdrawal of Soviet 
troops from Germany. Implementation of these plans, however, 
would be preceded by a far more vigorous propaganda campaign 
in the hope of convincing the German people that the USSR 
stands ready to keep faith with Germany whereas the western 
powers insist upon continued occupation. Regardless of what 
propaganda proposals are made, the Kremlin cannot risk with-
drawal. of its forces from eastern Germany until the Communist 
position there has been sufficiently consolidated, probably not 
before the summer of 1949, 
Inflationary Trends Inflationary symptoms now appearing 
In western Germany may eventually 
imperil its financial structure, the morale of the population, 
and the industrial production upon which much of western 
European recovery depends. The inflationary tendencies are 
being strengthened by the easy credit policy of the banks and 
by the Large operating deficits of most of the Laender govern-
ments and the Bizonal Economic Council. Despite widely-
proclaimed intentions by the German governments to economize,

practically no attempt is being made to bring government ex-
penditures into line with revenues. Credit expansion and the 
release of blocked accounts since the currency reform have 
increased the money in circulation from 1.1 to 14 billion marks. 
This increased money supply has raised prices, thereby en-
couraging the reappearance of hoarding, the black market, 
and pressures for wage increases. 
ITALY 
Italian Colonies Although the UN has postponed until April 
discussion of the controversial Italian 
colonies question, the maneuvering which preceded this de-
cision underscored the difficulty of reaching a generally 
acceptable solution and has already produced repercussions 
In Italy and North Africa. In Italy, bitter reaction to the lack 
of US and British support for the return of the colonies to 
Italy will probably cause Premier De Gasperi to soft-pedal 
temporarily his efforts to gain popular support for an Italian 
bid to join the proposed Atlantic Pact. De Gasperi's pro-
west position is already opposed by neutrality-minded left-
wing members of his own Christian Democratic Party, as 
well as by moderate Socialists, extreme leftists, and other 
nationalist elements. In French North Africa, French support 
of Italy's claim to a trusteeship over TripoMania has, by 
revealing France's intention to maintain indefinitely the 
colonial status quo, sharply increased Arab nationalist re-
sentment against France.

FRANCE 
Budget Deficit The budget deficit problem will require the 
full attention of the Queuille Government 
during the next few weeks if it is to survive politically and 
at the same time further the progress of France along the 
road to economic recovery. In its efforts to bring expendi-
tures into line with revenues, the Queuille Government will 
be confronted with: (1) opposing pressures from powerful 
political, economic, and labor groups for relief by govern-
ment action; and (2) conflicts between France's immediate 
fiscal needs and US European recovery objectives. Any 
sound solution to France's budgetary problem must now take 
Into account US decisions involving such matters as the :size 
of ECA dollar aid for 1949 and French investment program 
commitments under the European recovery program. Mean-
while, the internal problems of the Queuille Government are 
best demonstrated by the divergent official policies of two 
of its political supporters, the Radical Socialists and the 
Socialists. The Radical Socialists demand, among other 
things, massive cuts in government expenditures, a lessen-
ing of governmental controls over business, and lowered 
taxes to encourage production. The Socialists, in contrast, 
oppose reduction of the civil service, seek stronger govern-
ment control over prices and production, and urge a re-dis-
tribution of the tax burden, which would mean higher taxes 
for business. Confronted with the task of retaining the 
support of both these opposing forces and at the same time 
reducing the budget deficit, the Queuille Government must 
either find a compromise course or face a vote of non-con-
fidence from its awn dissenters as well as from the Com-
munists and Gaullists.

EASTERN EUROPE 
Satellite Economy Strengthened Kremlin control over the 
Satellite ecOnonaies will probably result 
from current discussion; in Moscow between Soviet officials 
and economic delegates from all the Satellites except Albania. 
The presence of top political and economic leaders from 
Czechoslovakia and rumors of an impending visit to Moscow 
by a high-level Polish delegation reflect the importance the 
Kremlin attaches to the development of the industrialized 
economies of Czechoslovakia and Poland. In fact, the rapid 
deterioration of the highly-important Czechoslovak economy 
since the February coup may have prompted the Kremlin to 
consider immediate drastic steps to alleviate the ailing eco-
nomic situation in the Satellite area. Realizing that two years 
of ruthless Soviet exploitation of Satellite resources, coupled 
with a curtailment in east-west trade, may finally be threaten-
ing economic dislocation in eastern Europe, the Kremlin may 
have decided to exercise more direct control over the econo-
mies of the Satellite nations and to implement a more closely 
Integrated plan for their economic development. The USSR 
is probably also motivated by the necessity to improve the 
economy of eastern Europe in order to counter the growing 
economic recovery in western Europe. 
SOVIET UNION 
Israeli Policy Although the Kremlin is unlikely to alter its 
basic policy toward Israel before the 25 Jan-
uary Israeli elections, the recent marked change in Czecho-
slovalda's earlier friendly attitude toward Israel may reflect 
an impending change in Soviet tactics in the Near East. Czecho-
slovak authorities have cancelled the Israeli military training 
program and the Government has allegedly forbidden unscheduled

air flights to Israel. This latter move, by curtailing clandes-
tine arms shipments, represents as obvious financial loss to 
Czechoslovakia and was probably dictated by the Soviet 
Union. The USSR may estimate that the establishment of 
Israel as a disruptive force in the Arab world has now been 
accomplished and that further military aid to a country of 
basically pro-western sympathies would ultimately prove 
prejudicial to Soviet interests to the Near East. Nevertheless, 
the Soviet Union, In the faint hope that Israel's pro-western 
itlignment may change after the 25 January Israeli electioas, 
Ms not yet altered its basic policy of politically supporting 
Israel. 
GREECE 
Guerrilla Activities Although neither the Greek A.r3ny nor 
the guerrillas have undertaken large. 
scale operations, they have continued their efforts to search 
out the other's weaknesses and to maneuver for position. 
Significantly, guerrilla logistics appear to be as satisfactory 
as ever. Supplies are being trucked into the Vital triangle from 
both Albania and Yugoslavia, and the Grammos area, laboriously 
cleared by the Greek Army last summer, Is again serving as 
a supply link between Albania and central Greece. Czechoslovak 
mm.Skoda artillery pieces have been found among recently 
captured guerrilla equipment. 
The guerrillas have meanwhile continued their propa-
ganda efforts. In the battle zone, they have begun to use artil-
lery to fire their leaflets. Behind the front, Markos' radio 
broadcasts to the Greek Army are emphasizing conciliation 
and urging the formation of unit "reconciliation committees" 
which would act to stop the war. Although the Greeks cannot 
believe that Markos honestly wishes a reconciliation with the

MIA -PAKISTAN 
Military Operations The impending departure on 15 January 
of General Sir Roy Bucher, the British 
officer now commanding the Indian Army, increases the possi-
bility of full-scale open warfare between bdia and Pakistan. 
General Bucher has exerted a moderating Wham* on Indian 
military policy and, in cooperation with his British opposite 
number in Pakistan, has held to a minhnum direct encounters 
between the Indian Army and Pakistan's regular troops in 
Kashmir. His successor, Lieutenant General K. M. Cariappa, 
Is reportedly vain, temperamentally unstable, and lacking in 
sound military judgment. In attempting to give palatable mili-
tary advice to the Indian Government, he may fail to give due 
consideration to all of the military and political factors in-
volved and may use his new position to seek the personal 
glory that a speedy termination of the Kashmir campaign 
would provide. The need for a prompt political solution of 
the Kashmir problem is underscored not only by General 
Cariappa's appointment but also by the prospect that weather 
conditions will be more favorable for military operations 
after 1 January 1949. Even if India does not start a clear-cut 
offensive operation, Increased Indian pressure may cause an 
already nervous Pakistan to launch a "preventive" offensive. 
TURKEY 
Arab Relations Turkey has demonstrated the seriousness 
of its desire for an Arab-Zionist settle-

Arab displeasure, on the UN's three-power Palestine Con-
ciliation Commission. Already confronted with hostile powers

TURRET 
along a considerable portion of their frontier, the Turks have 
necessarily placed great stress on maintaining good relations 
with their Arab neighbors. Turkey voted against the partition 
I Palestine in 194? and in its subsequent actions has been 
careful to avoid any steps which might provoke Arab hostility. 
At the same time, however, Turkey has been concerned over 
the deleterious effect the Palestine dispute has had on Near 
East stability and the resulting opportunities for Soviet agi-
tation. During the past year the Turkish Government has 
sought on a friendly, informal basis to persuade the Arabs 
that their interest would best be served by a Palestine settle-
ment. Now Turkey, along with the US and France, will have 
to take the blame for any acts of the Commission to which 
the Arabs object (see page 14). 
SOUTH AFRICA 
Government Rift A growing split between the Nationalist 
and Afrikaner Parties has weakened 
Prime Minister Malan's coalition government and raises 
the possibility of new general elections. The rift has devel-
oped as a result of differences between the leaders of the 
two parties over the allocation of seats for the March pro-
vincial elections and over constitutional questions connected 
with the bill for depriving colored persons of representation 
In the Assembly. Prime Minister Malan apparently has the 
choice of risking a new election or of paying the price for 
continued cooperation of the Afrikaner Party, led by N.C. 
Revenge. In the case of new elections, Revenge might join 
with Smuts' United Party, a development which has been 
facilitated by the death of Smuts' successor-designate, 
J. C. Hofmyer.

FAR EAST 
Economic Conference The recent, unharmonious meeting of 
the UN Economic Commission for 
Asia and the Far East ( ECAFE) chiefly centered around: 
(1) renewed efforts by Asiatic delegates to secure US backing 
for a "Marshall Plan" for Asia; (2) continued discord between 
colonial and anti-colonial powers; and (3) Soviet attempts to 
exploit these differences. The US-Dutch attempt to bar the 
Indonesian Republic from membership in ECAFE was soundly 
defeated by an 8-2 vote. US refusal to sponsor a "Marshall 
Plan" for Asia has created an anti-western sentiment which 
the USSR is exploiting, along with the quarrel over seating 
the Indonesian Renublic. as nroof that "imoerialist western 
nations" seek to keep the Aa1at4c economy in a "semi-colonial" 
state. On the other hand, the USSR itself suffered a propaganda 
defeat when the Commission emphatically voted down a Soviet 
amendment to an ECAFE resolution favoring import of foreign 
capital.

of "victories" and "strategic withdrawals,' must soon be 
confronted with the stark fact that shattering reverses are 
being suffered by the Nationalist forces south of Hsuchou. 
The position of the encircled Nationalist forces southwest of 
Hsuchou and west of Kuchen is virtually hopeless. Although the 
Pangfou Nationalists will probably attempt to withdraw south of 
the Yangtze river, it is doubtful that many of these forces can be 
salvaged to bolster the weak Nanking defenses. The only chance 
for a breathing spell for the Nationalists lies in the possibility

that the Communist armies will have to pause to re-group 
and replace expended materiel. In North China, the 
Nationalist position is also deteriorating rapidly. Fu 
has withdrawn from most of his outlying positions to the 
cities of Peiping and Tientsin, and Communist advance 
guards have already reached the outskirts of these two 
Nationalist bastions. Present indications are that a political, 
rather than a military, decision will effect a transfer of 
power in the area. 
Manchurian Autonomy Hints in the Chinese -Communist 
press of Dairen that Manchuria 
will have a special status, under Communist control, are 
substantiated by the Communist radio announcement of a 
new, unified currency for all of "liberated" China except 
Manchuria. Although such special status for Manchuria 
may be motivated, in part, by a desire to keep the relatively 
unstable north and central China economy from debilitating 
that of the Manchurian area, the special status arrangement 
may also be the first step in setting up a Manchurian People's 
Republic similar to that of Soviet-dominated Outer Mongolia. 
The Dairen press release carried plims for setting up the 
Judicial, administrative, and executive departments of a 
"People's Republic," and commented that the Communist 
Party must completely direct the affairs of the government.

tinient in the Netherlands strongly favors a move by the 
Government to push ahead with its Dutch-sponsored federal 
movement in Indonesia. The Government will encounter 
resistance from its constituents if, in response to the pres-
sure of the UN and world opinion, it delays this program 
further or renews negotiations with the Republicans. 
Meanwhile, the Indonesian Republic is attempting 
to marshal both internal and foreign support for an eventual 
showdown with the Dutch. The Republican Government claims 
that, if forced to flee by Dutch police action, it will move to 
southern Sumatra and, if necessary, will establish a govern-
ment-in-exile in India. Indian support in such an eventuality 
may also include denial to the Dutch of air landing rights and 
an embargo on all Dutch shipping. The Republican government 
is also intensifying its efforts to win the support of non-Repub-
lican nationalists.

ARGENTINA 
Economic Policy Argentina's failure to take effective 
measures to relieve its unfavorable 
economic position apparently is resulting from a conflict 
between leading personalities of government and finance, 
That Peron permits such behind-the-scenes maneuverings 
to nullify government action on such a vital matter?adjust-
ing Argentina's foreign trade politicies to what is becoming 
an international buyers' market--indicates that Peron does 
not yet consider economic deterioration to be an immediate 
threat to his internal position. (His party obtained a strong 
majority in the 5 December elections.) As Argentina's 
Internal economic crisis becomes more acute, however, 
Peron may be forced to intervene in these backstage maneuvers 
to the extent of initiating negotiations leading to a broad under-
standing with the US.

PROSPECTS FOR PALESTINE CONCILIATION COMMISSION 
Last-minute adoption by the General Assembly of an almost 
completely emasculated resolution on Palestine reflects: (1) the 
Assembly's unwillingness to define (as it did in the 1947 parti-
tion resolution) the terms of any solution which would require 
forceful imposition; and (2) a consequent decision to permit 
the situation to work itself out along the lines of the existing 
Israeli fait accoropli. &Ur events had pretty well run their - 
course In Palestine, the GA finally adopted a resolution winch 
simply established a Conciliation Commission (to be composed 
of representatives from the US, France, and Turkey) to assist the 
Arabs and Jews to achieve a settlement. The GA did not recom-
mend a basis for settlement, and the Commission will be con-
fronted with almost all of the multiple difficulties faced in turn 
by last winter's Palestine Commission, last summer's Truce , 
Commission, by Count Bernadotte, and by Dr. Bunche, the 
present Acting Mediator. 
Although the Provisional Government of Israel considers 
the present as a propitious time to negotiate a favorable settle-
ment, most of the Arab governments concerned are unwilling 
to enter into early negotiations. The Lebanese Government 
refuses to talk while Israeli troops occupy areas of southern 
Lebanon. The present political crisis in Syria was canoed in 
part by the failure of the government's Palestine policy, and 
it is extremely unlikely that any new government will either 
desire or be permitted to negotiate with Israel. Iraq still 
maintains about 15,000 troops in central Palestine, and the 
Iraqi Government continues to advocate concerted opposition 
to Zionism by the Arab states. The Iraqi Government does 
not dare bring home an army that has failed to defeat the 
Zionists; it is difficult, therefore, to imagine on what basis 
Iraq could negotiate with Israel. Egypt refuses to negotiate 
while Israeli troops continue to control the Negeb, occupy 
Beersheba, and hold as virtual prisoners an Egyptian brigade 
at Faluja.

There is little doubt that Abdullah of Transjordan would 
like to negotiate a broad settlement with Israel. A local armi-
stice in Jerusalem between Israeli and Arab Legion officers is 
working smoothly, and Abdullah has been urged by the recent 
conference of Palestinian Arab notables at Jericho to proclaim 
himself joint ruler of Arab Palestine and Transjordan. On the 
basis of these two developments, agreement between Israel and 
Transjordan might appear to offer hope for a broad settlement 
In Palestine. 
Other members of the Arab League, however, strongly op-
pose the Jericho resolution. The Kings of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, 
and Yemen, Azzam Pasha (the Arab League secretary general), 
the influential council of Ulernas of Al-Azhar University at Cairo, 
and the governments of Syria and Lebanon have expressed their 
disapproval. Unless this opposition is modified, it is doubtful 
whether Abdullah will act, despite endorsement of the Jericho 
resolution by the Transjordan Parliament. Even if he were to 
assume the Palestine crown and attempt to negotiate with Israel 
against the express wishes of other League members, he would 
probably gain little territory initially. His Arab Legion occupies 
the Old City of Jerusalem and a relatively small area bounded 
by Ramallah on the north and by Hebron on the south,. Abdullah 
Is therefore in no position to negotiate either the Negeb or the 
Galilee issue. Moreover, he is not likely to receive encourage-
ment at this time from the UK, which is anxious to avoid responsi-
bility for any development opposed by most of the Arab League 
and also realizes that Abdullah's authority in Palestine would 
be greatly limited. Eventually, however, the other Arab states 
may decide that it would be to their best interests to withdraw and 
let Abdullah bear both the onus of treating with the Israelis and 
the responsibility for subsequent developments in Palestine. 
Thus the Conciliation Commission faces a difficult task 
In trying to bring Arabs and Jews together in view of: (1) the 
absence of any basis for reaching a settlement; and (2) the re-
fusal of most of the Arab states to negotiate with Israel, In

effect, it will probably revert to a truce commission. It may be 
able to extend the present Jerusalem armistice into a demilitari-
zation agreement for the area and establish an effective armi-
stice in the Negeb and on the Iraqi front in central Palestine. 
However, it will probably have to ignore the question of boundaries 
and the continued presence of Israeli forces in southern Lebanon 
and Arab armies in Palestine.

MAO TSE-TUNG, CHINESE COMMUNIST LEADER 
Communist Leader Mao Tse-Tung, for 15 years the 
foremost champion of Chinese peasantry, has become the 
most powerful political leader in Asia. His stubborn, Intel-
ligent leadership is principally responsible for the steady 
groWth of the Chinese Communist Party whose armies apparent-
ly are winning the final battle for control of the Chinese nation. 
Mao's first ten years in the Chinese Communist Party, 
which he helped to found in 1921, were marked by obstinate 
Insistence that Communism in China could only be achieved 
through an organized and armed peasantry, evolutionary 
gradualism, and moderate bnd reform. With the expulsion 
of the Communist Party from the Kuomintang, the "rightist" 
opposition to Mao was deposed. Following the failure of 
Li Li-san's "proletarian revolution" in 1931, Mao's advocacy 
of a peasant base for Chinn* Commtmism became the Party's 
official program. To adapt Marxist Communism to his con-
cept' of China's needs, Mao continued to build his party and 
his army upon the base of a strong peasantry. His doctrine 
continues to include a moderate land policy and, for the pre-
sent at least, cooperation with non-Communist elements and 
a conciliatory attitude toward western nations. 
Although Mao's flexible pragmatism in adapting Com-
munism to the Chinese situation has led many western ob-
servers to believe that his allegiance to Communism is only 
tentative, his recent statements in the Corninform Journal 
Indicate that Mao will probably remain faithful to the USSR 
In all major issues. The possibility exists, however, that 
Mao at some future date will resist Soviet efforts to annex 
either Manchuria or the border provinces or to gain greater 
direct control over the Chinese Communist Party. Moreover, 
the return to Manchtria in 1945 of Li Li-san, an aggressive 
supporter of Soviet interests, might suggest that the Kremlin 
desires to strengthen Soviet control over the leadership of 
the Chinese Communist Party.
