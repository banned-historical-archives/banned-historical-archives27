ASSESSMENT OF 1965 DISSIDENCE LEVELS 
IN FIVE PROVINCES OF SOUTHEEN CHINA  
Summary 
Though dissidence in southern China -- Szechwan, Kweichow, Yunnan, 
Kwangsi, and Kwangtung -- is not declining, it is increasingly translated 
into apathy and resignation. No significant indigenous resitance is 
known to exist. 
An examination of selected examples of dissident activity in 1965, 
ranging from overt acts of an operational nature to simple evasion of 
militia responsibilities, shows that the regime is everywhere in full 
control of the country. The disproportionate amount of resources being 
poured into the control effort through consecutive campaigns of the inter-
minable Socialist Education Movement, however, may be an unfavorable 
augury for the regime. 
The coastal regions of Kwangtung, including Hainan Island, and Fukien 
(outside the study area) are the most dissident. Inland, there is little 
evidence of active dissidence either in the minority areas or in the ethnic 
Chinese areas of the other four provinces. Reasonably adequate infor-
mation is available only from Kwangtung, but hypothetical levels of 
dissidence elsewhere are judged not to exceed those of Kwangtung, as 
there is little qualitative difference in reports received. 
Popular dissidence has less chance of significant flowering than has 
intraparty dissidence, which can feed on provocative contradictions 
already present in Kwangtung. The logic of the situation points to 
eventual loosening of the tight control system, as intraparty dissidence 
increases, until some kind of semiovert political action becomes possible. 
Such a process might well begin among the cadres and populace of the 
Kwangtung coast, because the youthful population there is relatively 
sophisticated and has extensive relationships with the Overseas Chinese.

I. The Situation in Southern China 
This study assesses present dissidence levels in five southern prov-
inces of Communist China and attempts to identify manifestations of 
internal political weakness. The five provinces under examination --
Szechwan, Kweichow, Yunnan, Kwangsi, and Kwangtung -- are not an estab-
lished regional grouping, and for this reason, the indefinite appellation 
"southern China" is used. All five provinces, however, have large 
non-Mandarin-speaking or non-Chinese minority population groups and, 
except for Kweichow, are contiguous to areas that were either dissident 
in the recent past (Tibet) or are under foreign control (Burma, Laos, 
and North Vietnam). The most conspicuous geographical features they 
share are (a) remoteness from seats of central control; (b) poor overland 
communications with the rest of China and with each other; and (c) pro-
vincial economies which could sustain themselves in absence of assistance 
from the rest of China or from the outside. 
During 1965 southern China continued to labor under longstanding 
problems of economic weakness and popular weariness. Both problems were 
rendered more burdensome by the regime's dogged determination to achieve 
at almost any cost the reconditioning of the people and of the cadres to 
draw them away from individualistic economic and political incentives. 
This reconditioning effort had originated in the decisions of the 10th 
Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee in September 1962. It took form 
in the Socialist Education Movement (SEM) which began to unfold in 1963. 
Since then, no area of southern China has entirely escaped a seemingly 
interminable series of SEM campaigns to screen both leadership and pop-
ulace through rectification of abuses and errors and cleansing of motives 
and records. (Some reports forecast a duration of 7 years for these 
plagues.) Large task forces of students and cadres have descended on 
communes and other production units to carry out the necessary exhaustive 
checks. 
During 1965 the SEM thrust remained directed toward revitalization 
of the ongoing "class struggle," which is still the most important 
ideological objective. This was to be accomplished by organization of 
Poor and Lower Middle Peasant Associations (PLA); by investigative 
and punitive pressure on hidebound, weakly motivated, or corrupt cadres 
through the Four Clearances campaign (concentrating on the past perform-
ances of people whose backgrounds had survived earlier scrutiny); and by 
a new Three-Anti campaign in the eastern cities to strengthen internal 
security and job performance. 
These campaigns were supported by a variety of economic and social 
measures, some apparently experimental, which were designed to improve 
management practices. Commune accounting practices, agricultural credit 
facilities, and arrangements for marketing consumer goods received much 
attention. There were also efforts to begin to improve the morale of

urban workers assigned to the countryside through a new system of rota-
tional work assignments to rural villages, a system that offered a chance 
of ultimate return to the city. A vast new program to improve rural 
literacy and education through new part-time schools was carried forward. 
Meanwhile, resettlement policies were kept in motion to distribute un-
needed city dwellers, including unemployed youth, to state farms and to 
home-village communes. The prevailing response was sluggish and per-
functory. Though the SEM cut deeply, the people of China have tolerated 
it so far because they are habituated to such procedures and also because 
daily necessities were distributed with reasonable fairness and in greater 
quantity than in other years of greater distress. 
As before, militia and People's Liberation Army (PLA) recruitment was 
carried out late in the year but against a backdrop of war drums. In 1965 
there was a much heavier emphasis on militia recruitment and on improve-
ment of militia training and military effectiveness. However attractive 
the conditions of military service were for the majority of peasant young 
folk in many areas, enlistment in 1965 was unattractive to city young 
folk, especially to those of "questionable" family backgrounds who would 
encounter discrimination in the service.

Economic stringency continued unabated in 1965, and support for North 
Vietnam may have become more of an economic depressant than a stimulant. 
Industrial managers carried on from minor crisis to minor crisis, and their 
working forces were subject to transfer and dismissal despite spot short-
ages of labor. The telltale national propaganda emphasis on economy at 
all cost continued, implying that costly diseconomies in the industries 
concerned still continued. 
In sum, except for more use of frightening war talk by the authorities 
to prod the people, 1965 in southern China was not unlike the two preceding 
years. The economic upturn continued, but the rate of recovery remained 
slow. The people were dispirited, and factory dismissals and dispersion 
of the population to the countryside were a continuing threat to worker 
morale. There were not even enough jobs for the graduates of colleges 
and middle schools, let alone jobs for the more poorly trained academic 
weedouts. Political campaigns followed one another in steady sequence, 
sifting local leadership down to an awesome depth without introducing any 
new interest through fresh and vivid symbols. Incessant propaganda for

the continuing urgency of the class struggle hung over the south like a 
pall -- unprogressive, unconvincing,. uncompromising, and totally unavoid-
able. 
II. Problems of Assessment 
A. Source Materials 
Little information pertaining to active dissidence is available 
from Szechwan, Kweichow, Yunnan, Kwangsi, or even Kwangtung, although the 
combined population of these five provinces is almost equal to that of the 
United States. Kwangtung has more than 38 million people, but only from 
those parts that are in communication with communities of Overseas Chinese 
is intelligence reporting reasonably adequate in volume. For the rest of 
Kwangtung and for Kwangsi and Yunnan, some useful information is available; 
but for Szechwan and Kweichow there is almost nothing. 
Direct evidence of dissidence comes from refugees, mainland corre-
spondents of Overseas Chinese, travelers, and Chinese Nationalist sources. 
Indirect evidence helping to identify areas of potential difficulty can 
be gleaned from the propaganda output of the regime, because a great many 
good and bad local examples and instructive case studies are publicized 
for the guidance of cadre readers. 
B. Terminology  
In this study "dissidence" is used to mean a state of mind involving 
discontent or disaffection with the ruling regime, and "resistance" is 
used to mean dissidence translated into action. Because the terminology 
of the subject is difficult to control, certain qualifications of these 
definitions need to be stated. Resistance, or action, does not always 
result from dissidence, and both terms can be so used as to arouse un-
justifiable expectations by assumed implications. Popular resistance is 
a phenomenon which the regime understands. However, many other aspects 
of dissent -- ordinary stubbornness, intellectual and administrative 
"resistance," individual soul searching, dissatisfaction, disaffection, 
rationalization, and alienation -- may limit or encourage suppressed 
dissidence without pointing toward overt resistance. The train of in-
fluence from such manifestations is especially hard to follow when neg-
ative reactions are not directed squarely against the regime and its 
agents but instead take an oblique course. 
Allowance must also be made in describing or assessing actions that 
are compulsive. At the popular level, when dissident manifestations are 
compulsive, they may be conspicuous but still weakly directed and lacking 
in purpose, and thus their significance is lowered. If such types of 
protest and reaction are not suppressed and rationalized into apathy and 
resignation or into a conditioned compliance with private reservations,

Approved For Release 199019.981i19.1.fiRpF.7A9..?01008A000100060002-5 
spectacular but pointless events may occur. A food riot is a good example. 
The participants are unlikely to proceed toward political goals when 
their first objectives are satisfied by corrective action that is simple 
and immediate. Their "resistance" is of little long-term significance 
except to further discredit local cadresp whose discomfiture and possible 
demoralization may be the only significant consequence. 
Within the CCP and its auxiliaries, dissident impulses even when 
strong are likely to be suppressed under the pressure of personal respon-
sibility and self-concern and transformed into something other than 
resistance. Such suppressed reactions hold in them the distant promise 
of the liberalization that has begun to take place within the USSR. 
Finally, in this study it is recognized that there is a level or 
range of dissidence which is normal and tolerable in every political 
system, even that of Communist China, and that dissidence falling within 
that range does not usually constitute an appreciable control problem. 
In healthy democratic countries, where dissent is respected and channeled 
legitimately into the political process, the dissidence level is very high. 
In totalitarian countries, where all dissent is carefully watched, dis-
sidence levels still may range from very low to moderate without endanger-
ing the stability of the state or of the Party. Even very small displays 
of overt dissidence are vigorously suppressed in Communist China, and for 
this reason actions which would be trifles in Western'countries merit 
examination when reported from Communist China. Even appreciable amounts 
of dissidence, however, though indicative of genuine trouble may be no 
threat to the state or to Party control of the state. They are generally 
ineffective as long as they are mostly transformed into apathy and res-
ignation at the popular level or into stylized compliance coupled with 
conscientious suppression of reservations at the cadre level. 
C. Analytical Pitfalls  
Considering the magnitude of the field in southern China, the size 
of the intelligence sample covering dissidence is infinitesimal. Coverage 
is best for Kwangtung, and reports from the other provinces are not 
qualitatively dissimilar. They stress events that are similar and, often, 
of equal triviality. It is reasonable, therefore, to conclude that in 
the four provinces other than Kwangtung dissidence levels are probably 
no higher than those in Kwangtung. They are probably no lower than those 
in the noncoastal parts of Kwangtung. Along the coast the people are 
less timid, more sophisticated, and more aware of the world of the Over-
seas Chinese. Comparisons of the extent of dissidence also need to be 
used cautiously. Apathy and resignation at the popular level are probably 
widespread. The inference that ipso facto a great deal of potentially 
active dissidence should exist throughout the five provinces, however, 
is not necessarily true. In fact, the opposite may be true.

C-O-N-F-I-D-E-N-T-I-A-L 
Comparisons between the two main types of dissidence -- intraparty 
and popular -- are hazardous. The more insidious intraparty dissidence 
is less conspicuous than the more tangible popular dissidence. Qualitative 
tests are especially applicable to intraparty situations, whereas assess-
ment of popular dissidence comes down to the weighing of simple magnitudes. 
Further, the two worlds of work and action are accessible from the outside 
in entirely different degrees. The populace is almost entirely out of 
reach in contrast to the cadres and Party members, who are better informed, 
more alert, and more susceptible to outside stimuli. 
The theoretical dissidence potential created by cloth rations that 
are inadequate provides an example. This situation is a standing reproach 
to the regime. It is essentially absurd that the populace should be 
deprived of what it could either make for itself by cottage methods or 
could secure from efficient factories in a properly working consumption 
economy. The responsible cadre who controls cloth rationing operates in 
a system of responsibility which is different from that of the peasant. 
The peasant's desire is for clothing. If he is issued cloth, deprivation 
is eliminated as a cause of dissidence, and there is no objective to 
justify active dissidence. The senior cadre, however, has needs that 
can hardly be met, short of overhaul of the national economy. Working 
under pressure from both sides, he tries to satisfy the people, the Party, 
and himself. When demands from below are importunate and demands from 
above are unreasonable, his own obvious need is for a situation in which 
he can perform both responsibly and effectively. Such a need may lead 
him privately to try to change the system or to conduct himself as though 
the system had indeed been changed. Put another way, the peasant's prob-
lem, his need for cloth, is material, and his career does not hang on 
the receipt of such cloth. The cadre's problem is organizational, and 
his career in the system hangs on administering the situation he is handed 
GO as to avoid trouble for himself. Peasant dissidence has nowhere to 
go, unless a riot can be called an achievement. Cadre dissidence, on the 
other hand, conceivably has a great deal to gain through keeping the issue 
alive in order to achieve far-reaching changes in the distribution system. 
III. Selected Examples of Dissidence 
The accompanying map, Dissidence in Southern China: Selected  Problem 
Areas, 1965, identifies general areas from which reports reflective of 
dissident acts or especially weak cadre performance during 1965 were 
received. The greatest concentration of dissidence is close to the coast, 
where a tough-minded population simmers in virtual silence. Dissidence 
levels in the other two areas appear to be lower. 
A. Overt Acts 
The year 1965 was not as productive of reported overtly dissident 
acts as was 1964. The most spectacular event definitely known to have

occurred in southern China took place on Hainan on 5 February or shortly 
afterward. It included the burning of warehouses, destruction of some other 
facilities, and killing of a number of Communist cadres. The exact 
location is uncertain, although the press service report placed it in 
Wen-chang Hsien. As if to corroborate this report, the Chinese Communists 
later announced that, as of June 1965, the PLA was "actively assisting 
the local militia in raising their political consciousness and improving 
their military skills." This was in the Wu-chih Shan of central Hainan, 
a guerrilla-base area of the past and the area in which GRC agents were 
captured in 1963. The announcement implied that the local militia per-
formance was unsatisfactory until this PLA "assistance" brought a rise 
in both enthusiasm and abilities. 
Swatow and its environs experienced some terrorism beginning early in 
the year and an augmentation of repressive activity later in the year. 
Uncorroborated reports speak of two explosions in early April -- one in 
the "naval yard" -- which were followed by some 300 arrests and also of 
twin explosions in an automotive workshop and in a "chemical factory" on 
11 November. Again, the best confirmatory evidence that such events 
took place was provided by the regime, which in August began to subject 
Swatow to an intensive anti-escape, anti-corruption, anti-rumor, and 
anti-sabotage campaign. Although propagandists often use the word 
"sabotage" metaphorically, a convincing scale of punishments was reported 
for problems of malingering and "destruction" of equipment, ranging from 
5 to 10 years for light offenses to death for serious offenses. Meanwhile, 
transmission of rumors was also on the increase. 
Food riots must have diminished in 1965. The only one which has been 
reported apparently occurred in Jao-p'ing, 50 kilometers northeast of 
Swatow on the Fukien border, during the Chinese New Year period. The 
uncorroborated report states that 3,000 people took part and that it was 
put down by troops. Canton also experienced terrorism during the same 
period. Of several explosions reported, perhaps the most serious was one 
in a textile plant on the Chinese New Year's Day itself, when, reportedly, 
scores were killed or injured. On 19 January an explosion in downtown 
Canton was accompanied by distribution of anti-regime pamphlets, although 
possession of these pamphlets draws such vicious punishment that it is 
hard to believe many are read. Later, in early May, a large factory 
was "destroyed" by an explosion, which was followed by an explosion in 
a local railroad station. Once again, the authorities gave some support 
to these uncorroborated reports by initiating in September a campaign 
against rumors, escapes, corruption, and discontent, during which ship-
yard workers learned that the Hsi-ts'un Cement Factory had been damaged 
by a worker. The culprit was apprehended in August and sentenced --
rather lightly it seems, if the sabotage was tangible -- to 20 years 
of hard labor.

C-0-N-F-I-D-E-N-T-I-A-L 
Apparently these terroristic events were successful in their purpose. 
Whether they were carried out by indigenous guerrillas or by trespassing 
saboteurs is not known. It is possible that these deeds were successful 
sabotage operations staged from outside and not the work of local in-
habitants. Nevertheless, they helped to reenforce a mood in which the 
Canton population is habituated to hearing of such gestures and also to 
avoiding involvement. Even a senseless railroad station bombing, although 
it provides no gain in prestige for the perpetrator, contributes to 
erosion of the regime's prestige by emphasizing the desirability of 
such noninvolvement. 
There are too few reports from the restive Tung Chiang region east 
of Canton to establish any pattern of resistance there. However, several 
unconfirmed reports from Hai-feng and Lu-feng suggest a low state of 
popular and cadre morale. This is consistent with conclusions suggested 
by Four Clearances campaign reports that there was occasional trouble in 
Hai-feng and Lu-feng. Two soldiers were reported killed in April in a 
gunfight with two defecting cadres; and 10 out of 12 fishing boats with 
120 Shan-wei villagers aboard failed in an attempted escape to Hong Kong. 
Reports from elsewhere in Kwangtung are more vague and less credible. 
It cannot be verified, for example, that there were 500 anti-Communist 
guerrillas established in Lo-ting and Hsin-i counties of western Kwangtung 
in spring 1965. A few reports of petty thievery and quasi-banditry 
suggest that a little local roguery has begun to reappear and, speculatively, 
that the militia in some remote areas may be unreliable. 
No overtly dissident activities were reported from Kwangsi in 1965. 
According to a vague 1964 report, a riot of troops (militia?) in Tung-nan 
Shan (exact location not known) was followed by extra precautions for the 
security of troops stationed there. The possibility is that PLA troops 
encountered resistance in suppressing wayward militia. The only reported 
overtly dissident events in Yunnan are easily attributable to agents from 
outside. Nothing meriting reprisal or swift suppression apparently 
occurred in Yunnan in 1965. The same can be said of Kweichow and of 
Szechwan, outside of its Tibetan areas, as far as is now known. 
B. Illegal Activities 
Petty crime continues and may be organized. Travelers continue 
to lose their papers and ration coupons at about the same rate as in 
earlier years. The regularity with which this happens raises the possi-
bility that escapees from labor-reform camps, vagrants, disfranchised 
persons, and others on the social fringe are able to secure redocumen-
tation through unofficial sources and that there is a well-entrenched 
black market in ration coupons. Reports of peddling of documentation 
have been received.

C-0-N-F-I-D-E-N-T-I-A-L 
Corruption exists, especially among cadres, and no doubt the regime 
chooses to call any collusive activity between cadres and populace 
"corruption." Four Clearances campaign disclosures led to large-scale 
prosecutions of cadres and numerous suicides. Tan-sui, about 30 kilo-
meters south of Hui-yang and only 40 kilometers from the New Territories, 
was hit hard, as was Mei Hsien. In Hai-feng and Lu-feng some 40 percent 
of the cadres were reportedly purged in late 1964. In the wake of the 
Four Clearances, most punitive assessments on cadres were for sums in 
the hundreds of dollars, which they conceivably can work off in time. 
At the bottom of the scale, very small sums were involved. Bribery at 
the 5-yuan (about $2.00) level to achieve cadre collusion in helping 
inmates escape from a forced-labor mining camp was reported in Hua Hsien. 
Such a sum -- about 2 weeks' pay for an inmate -- was hard to secure 
either in money or goods, because inmates were paid only in scrip. 
Two unverified reports of illegal political activity have come from 
Canton. In September 1965 a small "counter-revolutionary" organization 
of students called the Youth-Save-the-Country Party, was uncovered in 
the literature department of Chung-shan University. The ringleader 
received a 15-year sentence, and his associates 5-to-10-year sentences. 
The lightness of these sentences suggests that, if the report is true 
and the ring actually existed, something is still unexplained. Another 
group, the anti-Communist "Dragon Republic of China," reportedly saw its 
founder executed on 27 November 1965 after the organization had accom-
plished "sabotage" in various places. The founder began his organization 
during 1962 while a foreign-language student at Sun-Yat-sen University, 
recruiting other youths as fellow "dragons." In late 1965 he himself 
supposedly had participated in a dynamiting of a Canton "shipyard and 
steel mill." Some 85 of his associates had been picked up in southeast 
China and incarcerated for long terms. The significant common denom-
inator in these two reports is the attribution of anti-regime organiza-
tional activity to students and ex-students. Only students, probably, 
would attempt such organization at present. 
An example of illegal peasant activity comes from Chung-shan Hsien. 
Here villagers who had been deprived of their private plots of land in 
September 1965 tried later to open up new private plots secretly in 
remote areas, only to have the new plots discovered and confiscated. 
The small private plot, by its periodic elimination and almost predictable 
reappearance, is almost an indicator of the state of local morale. In 
southern China the Communists have handled the right to have a private 
plot as a concession. In Shensi in North China, on the other hand, an 
old secretary once stated that "we have never given up the principle of 
having private plots" and that they have also kept separate cadre plots. 
Provinces other than Kwangtung provide little information of similar 
interest. However, a Kweiyang (Kweichow Province) report stated that, 
as of mid-1963, about 35 percent of Kweiyang's farmers had not joined

communes, though they gave part of their crops to the communes. They 
were considered backward and were thought to be handling illegal business. 
This is somewhat indicative of the state of socialism in rural areas 
that are off the beaten path. 
Finally, an example of the thoroughness of Four Clearances sifting 
and the apparent pettiness of that campaign comes from a county-owned 
small collective farm in Chung-shan Hsien, perhaps a fairly average 
local situation, in which 13 percent of those investigated were punished. 
Of 83 persons on the farm, 9 were punished under the "Five Investigations" 
of personal backgrounds which ran from April through September. Two of 
the nine cases were serious -- one had an "unclear background" and one 
was a "reactionary thinker." In the Four Clearances investigation that 
followed, two cadres were punished and were sent to labor reform camps. 
Then the farm workers were at last ready to get busy on preparations for 
the "Third Five-Year Plan." 
C. Protests and Evasive Activity  
Protest in Kwangtung in 1965 took the form of evasiveness and of 
escape from the province. Suicides and threats of suicide appeared, not 
only among cadres, but also among family members of youthful conscriptees. 
Suicide, being a terminal form of protest, gets publicity and clearly 
shames the person whose deed caused it. Conscription and militia man-
agement were the main points of friction in inland areas, and around the 
coastal cities youthful discontent over labor assignments to distant 
farms, villages, and construction sites was prevalent. Stubbornness and 
evasiveness in the teeth of the Four Clearances campaign were reported 
from at least two places. In Lu-feng Hsien in late 1965 the "class struggle" 
reportedly became "tense and complicated," thus implying that outside 
cadres in their sweep across the county had not found confessions and 
denunciations readily forthcoming. In Huai-chi Hsien of western Kwangtung, 
also, there was Four Clearances difficulty with stubborn local cadres. 
The press later revealed that preferential work-point (credits in lieu 
of remuneration) distribution to dependents, disabled veterans, and ?the:: 
military-related elements of the population had been a Problem and that 
the regime had partially relented to permit adjudication of the inequities 
case by case. 
Early in 1965 there was already such apprehension over intensified 
conscription for military and labor needs that postal correspondents in 
the Canton area falsely prophesied mass exodus to Hong Kong similar to 
that of 1962. Youthful discontent was especially prevalent in the Tung 
Chiang area between Canton and Hui-yang, where besides the many youth who 
wished to leave China, many thousands (reportedly 600,000), including 
cadres, were in various stages of disillusionment. Discontent was also 
reported from Hsin-hui Hsien (near Kongmoon), where the authorities were 
hunting the unregistered residents who were nonnatives and were actively

conscripting youth for labor assignments, thus causing them to seek 
escape to Hong Kong and Macao. 
Evasion of militia responsibility was apparently still easy in Yunnan, 
but getting harder. In May about 800 out of 2,000 Ching-pro (Kachin) 
inductees deserted in Ying-chiang Hsien. At the end of the year it was 
announced that the Kunming Military Command had organized selected cadres 
and soldiers into 27 teams to circulate in various minority areas to sell 
the "people's war" concept and to establish militia organizations and 
training arrangements. Press items also put a finger on 'basic-level 
militia cadres" and identified remaining problems as those of "ideological 
consciousness" and "feudal superstitious activities." Villagers in one 
western county had had the courage in early 1965 to protest certain 
unjust labor reform sentences and shout down unfounded accusations. 
Press reports from Kwangsi attest to militia sluggishness there, 
also, and report at least one commune party branch, in Ya-lin, that got 
busy and reformed itself. Comparable information from Kweichow and 
Szechwan is not sufficient to characterize the local situations there. 
IV. Bases of Dissidence  
A. Popular Dissidence  
1. Minorities 
The dissidence potential among minorities (other than the 
Tibetans, who are not considered here) in southern China is greatly 
outweighed by that of ethnic Chinese. Chinese Muslims are a submerged 
group, and although the Chuang of Kwangsi are numerous, they are not 
important as a minority group. The Chinese Communists have an added 
advantage in imposing security measures on the local non-Chinese minor-
ities in that they can often offer compensatory improvements in the quality 
of village life. They are skillful in using public health and education 
measures, control of jobs and advancement, administration of supplemental 
rations, and postponement of unpopular socialization measures to keep 
tribal communities politically divided and to alienate the young. 
In 1965 no reports of trouble in the once-dissident Yao areas of 
northern Kwangtung were received. The Li and Miao on Hainan, with their 
record of support to the Communist-led island resistance during World 
War II, probably are as sensitive to the grievances of their old Communist 
leaders as they are to specific minority problems. There remains, however, 
the possibility of some friction with ethnic Chinese newcomers to the 
island. In Yunnan the Yi and the Ching-pro are probably the most restless 
of the large non-Chinese groups. The Yi tend to resist Communist intru-
sion into their highly inbred, traditional way of life. Perhaps the 
political sequestration of 48,900 Yi in the new Nan-chien Yi Autonomous

countryside. This group has provided the youthful defectors who have 
reached the Free World. Their potential for protest in the cities is 
not great, but in the state-farm network it is conceivable that they 
might have a potential for organizatiOn. 
b. Youth of Poor Class Backgrounds  
The most unfortunate of China's unemployed and unusable 
youth are those whose "class background" condemns them permanently to 
inferior status. Even those who willingly turn on their own families 
may find that this unnatural deed does not gain them full Party acceptance. 
A relatively large proportion of such youth live in the coastal areas of 
southern China, where past KMT affiliations of family members -- as well as 
suspect connections with Overseas Chinese -- tend to frustrate their 
careers. Theirs is a formidable plight, and this group has readymade 
objectives to justify possible future dissidence. 
c. Overseas Youth 
The regime has had only qualified success with Overseas 
Chinese youth who have returned to China for education and careers. They 
are often highly disappointed in what they encounter, frequently resist 
work or study assignments, claim special privileges and rights, and seek 
the main chance -- even to the point of escape. Southern China has 
received its share of these youth; some have families there. Wherever 
they go they are a leavening element. As a highly mobile group destined 
to be mostly rootless, they merit close watching. 
d. Peasant Youth 
The origins of country youth who seek industrial employ-
ment have never been studied. Some rural communities probably send few 
youth to the cities, but other villages have for generations seen their 
youth go to the cities. With this avenue now closing to them, rural 
youth have fewer opportunities, despite their having the same aspirations 
as city youth. The lackluster China Youth League (CYL), now refurbished 
under strong regime pressure, provides the means for youth work, cadre 
training, and selection of Party membership candidates; but the CYL 
recruitment task is an uphill one because of the joylessness of its 
Party mission. For such youth, if they avoid military service, militia 
service has some attractive privileges. The long-term prospect for 
peasant louth is one of increasing exposure to the same influences and 
pressures that motivate city youth, with the likelihood that their sophisti-
cation will increase to the point that political dissidence may finally 
become possible for them.

3. Overseas Chinese and Their Connections 
The largest number of Overseas Chinese originated in a 
relatively few counties in the Pearl River Delta and surrounding Swatow 
(and the Fukien ports), while lesser numbers came from much broader 
areas of Kwangsi and Kwangtung, including Hainan. Yunnanese have emi-
grated in sizable numbers only to Burma. 
Through the Overseas Chinese communities, including that of Hong Kong, 
a large proportion of the population of Kwangtung retains a special 
awareness of the outside world and is partially dependent on it as well. 
One village, noted at random, had 70 percent of its population dependent 
on overseas remittances in some degree. This supplemental source of 
income and information perpetuates tensions between the regime and the 
people, who are exploitable for foreign exchange and at the same time 
are vulnerable to a questioning of their "class status." These returnees 
and their relatives are unique in China for having an independent basis 
on which to discount regime propaganda (such as war-scare talk) and also 
for having dissidence assets such as a high degree of resourcefulness to 
pursue their own ends. Their situations vary from those of managers, 
cadres, and working peasants to those of political undesirables (labeled 
as landlords, rightists, counter-revolutionaries, rich peasants, and 
common criminals), unnecessary city residents, unauthorized returnees 
from country assignments, intended refugees, materialistic city dwellers, 
and unregistered elements of the population. 
One important subgroup of the Overseas Chinese includes the 100,000 
returnees from Indonesia, some 70,000 of whom were relocated on state 
farms which were established for them in the southern provinces. Many 
of them were poor people who apparently had no ancestral villages to 
receive them. They probably have a dissidence potential, even if they 
have not yet achieved the level of anti-Communist organization which one 
optimistic report suggests. 
B. Intraparty Dissidence 
At the national level there are various indications that morale 
within the CCP is soft in spots. One symptom has been the regim's 
readiness to push the unfinished SEM to almost any length and at almost 
any cost. Another recent symptom has been eXcessive reliance on Mao as 
the incontrovertible symbol of consensus, a practice which may conceal 
impending exhaustion of the Party's own ability to persuade. There is 
also indirect evidence that all is not well between the Party and the PLA. 
Against this national backdrop, the southern provincial parties, and 
especially the exposed Kwangtung party, retain their own historical 
problems.

The Kwangtung provincial CCP faces a resourceful population with 
shallow loyalties to the regime. It harbors remnants of an older party 
machine whose chief failure was unwillingness to admit that local inter-
ests are always secondary. Its cadres are inclined to come to terms 
with local interests. As a Canton editorial said in 1963, ". . . many 
rural cadres now tend to sympathize with those under their supervision 
and no longer unquestioningly accept orders from higher authority." 
Its cadres have endured the interminable and merciless SEM campaigns of 
1963-65 with many casualties from their ranks. A secret reregistration 
of Party members as part of a weeding-out process aimed at followers of 
former leaders was reported from Canton in early 1964. There seems to 
have been little Party progress since 1965 except at great cost, and the 
possibility for persistence of significant intraparty dissidence seems 
real. If it were to lead to growth of common cause between remnants of 
the old party and embattled cadres of the new party, the basis of a 
conservative, traditionalist, and ideologically tolerant intraparty 
movement could conceivably materialize. 
The accompanying map entitled Kwangtung: Responsiveness to CCP  
Provincial Committee, April 1965 provides some indication of the relative 
strength of the local Kwangtung CCP in 1963 against local inertia at the 
outset of the SEM. It depicts the results of a single inquiry into local 
response to a new project of the provincial Central Committee -- the 
"rural edition" of the Nan-fang Jill-pao. The case study was published 
for the guidance of local cadres, showing where cadres had taken prompt 
action to make the paper generally available and where they had been 
dilatory. It appears to have been a reasonable test of relative cadre 
responsiveness before application of followup pressures. Therefore, it 
may be considered a measure of the degree to which the provincial com-
mittee writ was being heeded or ignored in early 1963 when the SEM was 
being launched. 
Results of the survey suggest two types of local situations. In 
some places blue-ribbon cadre forces held firm control on behalf of 
provincial authorities. In others, presumably, second-string cadre forces 
were left to their own devices or conservative party elements were in the 
saddle. Spotted within the areas most sluggish to respond, some key points 
performed well, as though the Party had concentrated good leadership 
resources there. Examination of the data suggests that they may have 
been "corrected" or "reestimated" before publication, but without nec-
essarily altering the general impression presented. 
Part of the background of this unimpressive Party position in 1963 
is found in Party history. Ironically, those parts of eastern Kwangtung 
and Hainan where popular tensions now run relatively high are places where 
Chinese Communist activity began more than 40 years ago. Here the local 
population, which by now must include many children and grandchildren of 
veteran Communists, is authentically proletarian and probably has little

to fear from campaigns against so-called class enemies. Furthermore, 
local CCP members can recall, sometimes with bitterness, a 1958 purge 
of cadres that left its scars to aggravate present difficulties. In 
1962 some low-ranking Hainan cadres were still rebelliously disgruntled, 
and it would be surprising if they and their eastern Kwangtung cohorts 
were reconciled even yet to the consequences of that purge. 
T'ao Chu, now a rising star nationally, did not consolidate his Party 
position in Kwangtung until 1955. Under his leadership in 1958 the pro-
vincial committee achieved a fully national orientation by turning away 
from its aging local heroes of the 1920's, 1930's, and 1940's. The 1958 
dismissals signalled the end of an era for so-called parochialist local 
political machines in some places -- specifically on Hainan and in Ho-piu 
and Shao-kuan Hsiens, but doubtless elsewhere as well. Ku Ta-ts'un, 
formerly the boss of eastern Kwangtung, was removed from the central 
committee though he still lingers on as a powerless deputy governor. 
Feng Pai-chg, the old baron of Hainan, was also dropped from the central 
committee and in 1963 was removed from the province altogether and given 
a vice-governorship in Chekiang. The downfall of Chu Kuang, a once-
prominent cultural and political figure who may still have loyal followers, 
has been even more protracted. It began in 1952, but not until 1960 was

C. Regional Review 
In southern China the CCP faces a continuing task of improving 
its controls in distant provinces. Each province has its strong key 
points and areas of weaker control, and with security as with dissidence 
the cities lead and the countryside follows. Away from the vulnerable 
coastal areas the inland regions divide simply into those areas, more 
intensely cultivated and more densely populated, where ethnic Chinese 
predominate and into more sparsely populated and less productive areas 
where non-Chinese minority peoples live intermixed with ethnic Chinese 
settlers. In the minority areas, despite greater indulgence of delays 
in "socialization" and "political reconstruction," the authorities are 
steadily extending their effective reach and the PLA is deeply involved 
in tutelage of the population. In the predominantly Chinese areas the 
CCP does not operate differently from elsewhere. 
Canton and Swatow are the centers of mainland Kwangtung dissidence. 
The important delta counties are under very firm control, possibly because 
this was originally an area of KMT strength where the CCP did not wait on 
ceremony to eliminate conservatism. 
Elsewhere in Kwangtung, especially on Hainan and in the Tung Chiang 
region centering on Hui-yang, there may remain widespread vestiges of a 
brand of local Communism more conservative than that of the radical top

leadership. The scope of the present SEM indirectly suggests that cadres 
have probably been coming quietly to terms with local interests in many 
places. This trend could only have suited the conservative parochialists 
and sectionalists of the old Kwangtung party. Along the coasts and on 
Hainan, a population with far-ranging overseas connections and a background 
of KMT affiliation is now subject to indefinite prolongation of privation, 
disagreeable urban evacuation and rural resettlement drives, and con-
scription with discriminatory overtones based on class considerations. 
Economic distress and lack of economic incentives nurture poor cadre 
morale and disgruntlement of old cadres and uninfluential Party members; 
and among the populace such conditions encourage personal defeatism or 
self-serving private scheming and attempts to escape. 
The people of the coastal regions seem to share a growing sentiment 
of individual detachment from CCP goals while masking it by an increasing 
sophistication in making motions of conformity. In the future this trend 
will provide an increasingly suitable environment for slow nurture of 
forms of political dissidence that may in time secure from the local 
authorities the privilege of partially tolerated existence. Away from 
the coasts the CCP contends with local stubbornness. The border counties 
probably have special problems that make them hard to manage, but infor-
mation at hand is not sufficient to permit assessment. A report of 
"guerrillas" lying low southwest of Canton between the Kwangsi border and 
the coast is typical of dissidence reports that are impossible to cor-
roborate. Such a report may be discounted as probably meaning that the 
population in many villages is disaffected and that any resistance 
organization that may exist has probably been penetrated by agents of 
the authorities. 
Kwangsi is related to Kwangtung geographically and historically but 
is far more remote from outside attention. In 1965 no real difficulties 
were reported from Kwangsi. The newly reattached coastal region of the 
Chlin-chou Special District is a depressed area with very modest resources; 
but it still has an historic claim to dissidence. The counties along the 
Kwangtung border and especially around Wu-chou were a focus of attention 
in 1965, just as in 1960. This region may be somewhat soft because it is 
a gateway. Elsewhere in Kwangsi, the points of concern in 1965 were 
distributed virtually at random. 
In Yunnan the efficiency of the provincial government at least and 
possibly its entire security posture was called into question by the 
appointment of a Peiping "hatchet man" to the governouhip early in 1965. 
Little amplifying information has appeared since, but press comments 
leave no doubt that the provincial militia was in far from satisfactory 
condition during 1965. 
The geographical distribution of places of security interest in 19650 
compared to that of 19600 shows a provinae-wide scattering in 165 'instead

of the predominant distriBution along the east-west highway that prevailed 
in 1960. The inference is that in 1960 the consolidation of CCP local con-
trol was most important along the east-west route, whereas in 1965 CCP 
standards of control had been raised to include the entire province. 
Occasional reports of difficulties among Yunnan's minorities over 
intermarriage with Han Chinese or over recent intrusion of migrants from 
other provinces, such as Hunan, into tribal areas are reminders that 
ethnic conflicts remain. Political tools, such as development of Party 
"work" within the framework of new "autonomous" units, however, seem to 
suffice to control the anti-Chinese sentiments that may develop. 
The Chinese in Yunnan probably harbor more dissidence than do the 
non-Chinese, but this is not known to pose any control problem. Some 
reports suggest that levels of well-being in Yunnan are sometimes higher 
than in other provinces. Frictions probably exist between Overseas Chinese 
and local Chinese youth but are not conspicuously important. 
The most substantial information regarding Kweichow in 1965 was the 
unexplained removal in January or February of Chou Lin, the Party First 
Secretary and Provincial Governor -- a change that was followed by re-
organization of the provincial committee. Later in the year improvement 
of political controls over agriculture was publicized as a serious pro-
blem in the province. Whatever else it meant, the shakeup in Kweichow 
and the April appointment of Chou Hsing to the Yunnan governorship 
strengthened the influence of northerners in the southwestern provinces. 
In Szechwan the Chinese population is reported indirectly by PPst 
European sources to be widely disaffected toward the regime because of 
its exploitive grip on the provincial agricultural surplus. While there 
is no information on present dissidence levels, two current construction 
programs may have some effect. The first is the relocation of a number 
of small factories to Szechwan from eastern locations. The second encom-
passes the construction needs for this industry and for railroad con-
struction on the Yunnan line. Most reporting from Szechwan deals with 
its Tibetan fringes and is similar to reporting of other years -- minor 
administrative problems, the woes of travelers, and robbery. 
V. Conclusions and Prospects  
A. The Downward Slide of Resistance Potential  
Dissidence in southern China is not declining but increasingly 
translates into apathy and resignation, with attendant individual eva-
siveness. There is no known indigenous resistance movement now active. 
More information probably will be available later in the year, but as of 
March 1966 the incidence of overt acts of protest seems to be declining, 
despite the fact that preexisting levels of dissidence were apparently 
maintained during 1965.

C-O-N-F-I-D-F,N-T-I-A-L 
There is no effective anti-Communist leadership in any part of the 
study area. Popular apathy and resignation rule out both enthusiastic 
support of regime programs and energetic dissent from regime programs. 
As this mood sinks deeper, overt protest is slight but can take such 
drastic traditional form as suicide. 
Both rural and urban inhabitants have learned to avoid translation 
of economic dissatisfactions into political dissidence and can endure a 
high degree of deprivation so long as distribution is reasonably equitable 
without a break in morale. Minorities are mostly uninvolved in active 
dissidence. Within the study area the coastal regions of Kwangtung, 
including Hainan, have the largest potentially dissident population. 
Along the coast there is a greater awareness of the outside world because 
of the pattern of Overseas Chinese relationships beginning at Hong Kong 
and Macao and extending throughout the world. 
Despite the apparent strength of its control system, the regime is 
devoting an increasingly disproportionate amount of effort to "class 
warfare" and ideological campaigns. If this is a necessity merely to 
maintain existing levels of internal security, it is an unhealthy sign 
for the regime. As an attritive factor, however, it is balanced by the 
corresponding dissipation of potentially dissident leadership, especially 
among the youth and disaffected cadres. 
B. Conditions Inhibiting Active Dissidence  
In the last analysis, the ability of the regime to contain dis-
sidence rests on its ability to maintain pressure on the people. This 
awesomely sophisticated ability of the Chinese Communist regime is still 
unchallenged. It inhibits any formulation of dissident objectives by 
disaffected elements. 
The use of large task forces of students and outside cadres to carry 
out the Four Clearances campaign illustrates the ease with which the 
citizenry of Communist China can be manipulated. The task force members 
-- themselves either under training or under an ideological cloud of some 
sort and knowing it is in their own interest to do a good job -- have had 
no reason to make common cause with any stubborn local leaders whom they 
might encounter. The local people, for their part, reportedly often have 
taken out their resentments with gusto on the local cadres under Four 
Clearances encouragement. One side was played off against the other 
without any hint of mutual dismay being reported. 
The currently depressed economic situation also seems to be, on 
balance, a factor inhibiting dissidence. The regime manipulates even 
slight rewards, such as preferential cloth rationing, more effectively 
than any potential dissidents can exploit the lack of a satisfactory 
cloth ration. Food shortages, also, seem to have been accepted as facts

C-0-N-F-I-D-E-N-T-I-A-L 
of life so long as a measure of equity prevails in distribution. The 
most keenly felt irritants are those that involve inequities or dis-
criminatory treatment. Insofar as the Four Clearances campaign has 
attacked inequities and punished those to blame, it probably has entrenched 
the regime still further with the peasantry. 
It is probable that in the past the percentage of population in 
Kwangtung living under punitive detention has been large. In 1962, 
Hui-yang Hsien had a reported Public Security Bureau prison capacity of 
about 100,000 for a hsien population of possibly 1,500,000. In addition 
to such facilities, which presumably existed in every hsien, some pro-
vincial labor-reform camps such as that at the Lo Chia Tu mines had a 
population of almost 50,000. A separate study of labor-reform camps, 
local prisons, and other facilities for detention would be needed to 
disprove the possibility that an appreciable percentage of the provincial 
population still lives under corrective detention. 
C. Conditions Contributing to Active Dissidence  
Location close to the coast or to a large city is perhaps the 
most important single factor favoring effective dissidence in southern 
China. In such places the regime must keep dissidence at a lower level 
than in more remote places. For a dissident in such tightly controlled 
areas it is an asset to be part of the world of the Overseas Chinese. 
He is conscious of and occasionally shares some of the expectations, 
earnings, experience, and resourcefulness of the Overseas Chinese. The 
proximity of Hong Kong and Macao is also an influence. Individuals with 
overseas connections are more likely to be capable of formulating practical 
short-run plans with materialistic objectives and of attaining some of them. 
At the very least, such individualistic activity -- which seems to go on 
now, ramifying along the transportation routes away from the coast and 
the big cities -- contributes to a spreading climate of unconcern for the 
activity of other people. At most, it could become part of a slowly 
rising tide of "individualism" and so increase existing strains throughout 
the control structure that could lead to a loosening of the Chinese Com-
munist system and to the building of a base for future tolerance of dissent, 
student political activity, and other currently prohibited practices. 
The effective potential for active dissidence and resistance in inland 
areas (except perhaps in the Tibetan area of Szechwan, not considered here) 
is slight. Levels of dissidence tolerable to the regime may be quite high, 
physical control by the regime is virtually complete, and peasant objectives 
are usually limited. Further, peasant hostility to the regime may rise 
and fall -- depending on fluctuating degrees of deprivation and on changing 
pressures for labor levies, grain deliveries, and other forms of sacrifice 
-- without implying that the peasants would necessarily tolerate anti-
regime activity. This is especially true if the peasants are protected, 
as they now are, from nepotism and brigandage. However, even in remote

areas any local climate of dissatisfaction and incipient hostility will 
nourish a growing weight of youthful aspiration and career expectations. 
The regime's determination to reduce city populations through permanent 
distribution of surplus individuals throughout the countryside will only 
aggravate this trend. 
In the rural areas there has been no more prolific source of dis-
satisfaction than the preferential allotment of work points to cadres or 
to other favored persons and families. Work points have a variable local 
value, depending on the harvest. They are a sort of phantom currency 
that farmers, workers, and cadres use to build up balances against which 
to draw for necessities. Unlike money or scrip, work points are not a 
private medium of exchange. All arrangements and transactions are 
recorded and hence must be justifiable. People who deserve them, or 
think they deserve them, frequently are awarded modest work-point bonuses. 
Though exceptional arrangements are often reasonable, the system is readily 
abused. It has encouraged indefensible cadre-peasant collaboration to 
bypass onerous regulations and has brought on some of the corruption that 
the Four Clearances campaign exposed. If the new PLMP associations work 
effectively, the means of righting work-point inequities will be available 
to some of the peasants. As other forms of discrimination in favor of 
selected groups of peasants are being encouraged under the scrutiny of 
the PLIMPA's, however, similar inequities are destined to continue. 
Undesirable work assignments are another source of dissatisfaction. 
Even Party members resist unwanted transfers, thus further burdening the 
honest, hard-working administrative cadres whose disaffection would be a 
genuine loss to the regime. The amount of dissatisfaction with, and 
evasion of, mass labor assignments is unknown, but there is reason to 
believe that much effort goes into keeping such dissatisfaction under 
control. 
Finally, conscription for 'aabor. and for militia service has been 
far from popular and is even less so now under the cloud of popular 
apprehension aroused by recent war propaganda. 
D. Prospects for Future Dissidence  
The possibilities for widespread development of popular resistance 
are remote at present. The populace is tightly controlled in the densely 
populated areas. In the rural and hinterland areas, public security 
divisions and militia forces augment the PLA in physically controlling 
the territory of southern China so that resistance groups have no safe 
sanctuary. The most likely cause of dissidence that could lead to popular 
resistance, under changed circumstances, would be the force of sheer 
hunger or other types of suffering. Wfective armed resistance, however, 
would require leadership of the sort that could only come from labor 
reform camps, from the military or civil cadre force, or from the ranks 
of ex-servicemen.
