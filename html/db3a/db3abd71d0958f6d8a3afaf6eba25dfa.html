 Columbia River Power System, on its power
 operations, had lost $53,320,000 from 1958
 through 1963._ The Southeastern Power Ad-
 ministration, on its power operations from
 1955 through 1960, had lost $20,400,000. The
 sum of these losses was a gift to the users
 of this power, paid for by taxes collected
 from citizens in other areas.
 Thus, the General Accounting Office has
 found that major Federal power projects in
 general do not charge rates sufficient to cover
 the modest interest charges  imposed on
 them.
 RECOMMENDATION NO, 12
 July 1
 The significance of power from fusion, if
 it can be achieved, is (a) the fuel supply is
 unlimited since it exists in all bodies of
 water, and (b) the cost of power so pro-
 duced would be a fraction of present power
 costs.  We understand that this line of re-
 search in our own laboratories has been re-
 duced both in priority and support.  We
 believe this to be shortsighted.
 RECOMMENDATION NO. 14
 We recommend a new review of the peace-
 ful uses of atomic energy to determine the
 areas in which research can be effectively
 and increasingly supported and to restore
 the sense of urgency which seems to have
 yielded to the more glamorous and costly
 demands of space exploration.
 Mr. JAVITS.  Mr. President, this is

 having introduced all of their reports

 THE SITUATION IN VIETNAM
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, a
 group of outstanding Republican leaders
 in the other House has recently seen fit
 to deliver themselves of a tirade on policy
 in Vietnam. I am not surprised that the
 partisan political knives should be drawn
 on this issue. What amazes me is that
 they have come out of the sheaths so
 early. I can only conclude that they are
 intended to be used in a preliminary rum-
 ble in San Francisco as a warmup for
 the political war later on.

 that nation can be sealed off, not with
 tens of thousands, if not hundreds of
 thousands of U.S. forces, but with a
 wave of a statement, is not serious
 discussion.
 Fortunately, Mr. President, there are
 Republicans who understand the situa-
 tion in Vietnam from a firsthand ex-
 perience 'with it.  I refer particularly
 to our recent Ambassador in Saigon, Mr.
 Henry Cabot Lodge. He knows the
 meaning of what we are attempting in
 Vietnam and in southeast Asia. He
 knows the realities of the situation which
 confronts us.  He knows the . course of
 policy which offers the best hope of suc-
 cess.  We shall not hear from him any
 comment about "why win" or "pervasive
 softness." Here is what we shall hear
 from him-and I quote from Associated
 Press dispatch No. 52, on June 30, 1964:
 In Vietnam the_ aim of the struggle is to
 create a proper political atmosphere.  That's
 how 'you beat the Communists there.       The
 minute you've created a proper political at-
 mosphere the war is over. That's why I was
 encouraged by the report I received just
 before I left Saigon that people are no
 longer feeding the Communists.  I don't see
 the need for more troops in Vietnam.  I
 think our policy there of relying on the
 Vietnamese to win with our help is the right
 policy.
 Mr. President, the statement of the
 House Members to which reference has
 been made is not an invitation to serious
 discussion.  It obscures the real ques-
 tions with respect to Vietnam which con-
 front the people of the United States.
 These questions do need, and should
 have, discussion.  We do need- public
 clarity on rational objectives of policy,
 not only for Vietnam, but also for all of
 southeast Asia. We do need public dis-
 cussion of the means for achieving these
 objectives-of the military and the dip-
 lomatic channels which may be open or
 can be opened for dealing with the prob-
 lems of that region which involve not
 only the United States, but, first and
 foremost, the people of the region itself,
 and, in. a larger sense, the Chinese, the
 Russians, the Australians, the British,
 the French-indeed, in an ultimate
 sense, all of the people of the world.
 That sort of discussion would be help-,
 ful to any President, Repub:ican or Dem-
 ocrat, in this serious situation, as he
 strives, for all of us, to pursue a course
 which will safeguard our national inter-
 ests, bring about peace, and preserve the
 opportunities for freedom in southeast
 Asia, at the lowest possible cost in Amer-
 scan lives.
 That is what President Johnson is at-
 tempting.  Can any President attempt
 less? Can any President do more?
 Mr. President, the Republican task
 force also made a statement about the
 weakness of the Nation's military posi-
 tion. I ask unanimous consent to have
 printed at this point in the RECORD a
 news release by the Secretary of Defense,
 Robert S. McNamara, dated June 29,
 1964, in reply, to that segment of the
 statement, and, also a portion of the
 remarks made by the President of the
 United States at, the Coast Guard Acad-
 emy, at New London, Conn., on June 3,
 1964.
 There being no objection, the news re-
 lease and the excerpt from the Presi-
 dent's remarks , were ordered to be
 printed in the RECORD, as follows:
 (News release, Office of Assistant Secretary of
 Defense  (Public, Affairs),  Washington,
 D.C., June 29, 19641
 Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara
 today issued the following statement:
 "I read with regret the partisan attack on
 our Nation's military program contained
 in the report of the Republican policy com-
 mittee's task force on American strategy and
 strength.
 "The national defense has always been a
 bipartisan activity of the U.S. Government.
 To date Republicans as well as Democrats
 have supported the national defense pro-
 gram of the Kennedy-Johnson administra-
 tion.  Such support was given to our very
 first actions in 1961, which were to submit
 supplemental budget requests that increased
 the defense budget of this country by $8 bil-
 lion for fiscal year 1962.  From the begin-
 ning of this administration through our cur-
 rent request for fiscal 1965. there has been
 an increase of $28 billion over the level of
 spending that prevailed during the last year
 of the previous administration. These much
 needed increases have received bipartisan
 support throughout the country as a whole
 as well as in the Congress.
 "As a result of these increases, the nation-
 al security of this country has been greatly
 enhanced.  Since January of 1961, there has
 been-
 "A 150-percent increase in the number of
 nuclear weapons available in the strategic
 alert forces.
 "A 50-percent increase In our strategic
 bombers on alert.
 "A 60-percent increase in the tactical nu-
 clear force in Western Europe.
 "A 45-percent increase in the number of
 combat-ready divisions.
 "A 75-percent increase in airlift capability.
 "A 100-percent increase in funds for gen-
 eral ship construction and conversion to
 modernize our fleet.
 "A 175-percent increase in the procurement
 of airlift aircraft.
 "A 100-percent increase in the procurement
 of tactical aircraft,
 "A 44-percent increase in the number of
 tactical fighter squadrons.
 "An 800-percent increase in the Depart-
 ment of Defense Special Forces trained to deal
 with counterinsurgency threats.
 "A 15,000-man Increase in the strength of
 the Marine Corps.
 "Since 1960, the intercontinental ballistics
 missiles and Polaris missiles in our arsenal
 have been Increased from less than 100 to
 over 1,000 and the number of Polaris sub-
 marines in commission from 2 to 21.
 "Today  the  intercontinental  ballistic
 missile force of the United States is more
 than four times that of the Soviet Union.
 "As for the future, our research and de-
 velopment program has laid the foundation
 for a continuing increase in our military
 strength.  Since 1961, there has been-
 "A 50-percent increase per year in the total
 funds expended on research and. development
 over that prevailing during the last 4 years
 of the previous administration.
 "An addition of 208 major new ' projects:
 These include 77 weapons programs with
 costs exceeding $10 million each, including
 such major ones as the medium range bal-
 listic missile, the F-111 fighter-bomber and
 the new main battle tank. if
 "An increase in expenditures for the de-
 velopment  of  counterinsurgency  weapons
 and equipment from less than $10 million in
 1960 to over $103 million requested for fiscal
 year 1965.
 "A 54-percent increase in our antisubma-
 rine" warfare research and development pro-
 gram in our fiscal 1965 budget request over
 1961.
 "This  tremendous increase in strength
 could not have, Oven accomplished without
 the closest cooperation between military and
 civilian leaders. As Gen. Lyman L. Lem-
 nitzer said when he was Chairman of the
 Joint Chiefs of Staff: 'I am in constant touch
 with the Secretary, and through me, or in
 direct consultation with the Chiefs them-
 selves, he obtains the views of the Joint
 Chiefs of Staff,' and 'I would like to reiterate
 it here, there is the closest possible working
 relationship between the civilian officials in
 the Defense Department and the Joint Chiefs
 of . Staff:
 "Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor, who succeeded
 General Lemnitzer as Chairman of the Joint
 Chiefs of Staff, reaffirmed the existence of
 this intimate working relationship between
 the military and civilian leadership in the
 Pentagon in February of this year.  And in
 June of 1963, General Taylor said, 'the voice
 of the American soldier is entitled to a serious
 hearing in our national councils-and I am
 happy to report that he today receives that
 hearing.'
 "I am confident that there will continue
 to be the closest of working relationships be-
 tween the military and civilian leaders of
 the Pentagon."
 REMARKS  OF THE  PRESIDENT  AT THE  COAST
 GUARD ACADEMY, NEW LONDON, CONN.
 We, as well as our adversaries, must stand
 in awe before the power our craft has created
 and our wisdom must labor to control.  In
 every area of national strength America to-
 day is stronger than it has ever been before.
 It is stronger than any adversary or com-
 bination of adversaries.  It is stronger than
 the combined might of all the nations in the
 history of the world.
 And I confidently predict that strength
 will continue to grow more rapidly than the
 might of all others.
 The first area of this increasing strength
 is our ability to deter atomic destruction.
 In the past 3 years we have increased our
 nuclear power on alert 2i/2 times, and our
 nuclear superiority will continue to grow un-
 til we reach agreement on arms control.
 We have more than 1,000 fully armed
 ICBM's and Polaris missiles ready for re-
 taliation.  The Soviet Union has far fewer,
 and none ready to be launched beneath the
 seas.  We have more than 1,100 strategic
 bombers, many of which are equipped with
 air-to-surface and decoy missiles to help
 them reach almost any target.  The Soviet
 Union, we estimate, could with difficulty send
 less than one-third of this number over tar-
 gets iii the United States.
 Against such force the combined destruc-
 tive power of every battle ever fought by man
 is like a firecracker thrown against the sun.
 The second area of increasing strength is
 our ability to fight less than all-out war.  In
 the past 3 years we have raised the number
 of combat ready divisions 45 percent.      They
 can be moved swiftly around the world by an
 airlift capacity which has increased 75 per-
 cent. Supporting tactical aircraft have been
 increased over 30 percent, and the number
 of tactical nuclear warheads in Europe has
 been raised 60 percent.  We, and our NATO
 allies, now have 5 million men under arms.
 In addition we are now ready to mobilize
 large reserves in the event of conflict. Six
 divisions, with all supporting units, can be
 moved into action in a few weeks.
 And we are continuing to build our forces.
 In a few years our airlift capacity will be
 five times what It was in 1961.   Advanced
 weapons and equipment are flowing to our
 armies.  Our  fleet  is  being  modernized
 through  a  decade-long shipbuilding  pro-
 gram.                                                                                                                        And new tactical aircraft are being
 built.

 15144                     CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE                   Jul  f
 A third area of increasing strength is the
 struggle  against subversion. Our  adver-
 saries, convinced that direct attack would be
 aimless, today resort to terror, subversion
 and guerrilla warfare.  To meet this threat
 we began a large effort to train special forces
 to fight internal subversion.' Since Janu-
 ary 1961 we have increased these specialized
 forces eight times.  We have trained more
 than 100,000 officers in these techniques. We
 have given special emphasis to this form of
 warfare in the training of all military units.
 Our Army now has six Special Action
 Forces on call around the world to assist
 our friendly nations.  They are skilled in the
 languages and problems of the area in which
 they are stationed.  The Navy and Air Force
 have several thousand men whose abilities,
 training, equipment and mission are de-
 signed to combat clandestine attack.  And
 behind these groups are five brigade-size
 backup forces ready to move into instant
 action.
 But just as subversion has many laces, our
 responses must take many forms.  We have
 worked to increase and integrate all the re-
 sources, political and social as well as mili-
 tary and economic, needed to meet a threat
 which tears at the entire fabric of a society.
 But success in fighting subversion ulti-
 mately rests on the skill of the soldiers of
 the threatened country.  We now have 344
 teams at work in 49. countries to train the
 local military in the most advanced tech-
 niques3of internal defense.
 Subversive warfare is often difficult, dirty,
 and deadly. Victory comes only to those with
 the desire to protect their own freedom. But
 such conflict requires weapons as well as
 will, ability as well as aspiration.  And we
 will continue to increase this strength until
 our adversaries are convinced that this course
 too will not lead to conquest.
 The fourth area of increasing strength is
 In the development of new weapons for de-
 terrence and defense.  In the past several
 years we have begun many Important new
 weapons systems.  Minuteman II will have
 twice the accuracy of the first Minuteman.
 The new mike X, when its development is
 completed, will give  ifs the option to de-
 ploy, if national security requires it, the
 best antiballistics missile available to any
 nation.  We are developing a new aircraft,
 the F-III, with much greater range, pay-
 load, and ability at air combat than present
 tactical bombers or fighters.
 The Lance missile, the EX--10 torpedo, the
 A-7A attack aircraft, a new main battle tank,
 new antitank missile systems, are the emerg-
 Ing products of development that we are car-
 rying on. And that effort is without parallel
 in all the world.  We will continue to carry
 forward new projects which offer hope of add-
 ing substantially to our strength.  I can
 assure the American people that the United
 States is, and will remain, first in the use
 of science and technology for the protection
 of the people.
 DEPLORABLE  FINANCIAL  STATUS
 OF CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL, WASH-
 INGTON, D.C.
 Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, I offer for
 the RECORD a brief statement describing
 the deplorable financial condition in
 which the Children's Hospital of Wash-
 ington, D.C., finds itself as a result of
 inadequate funds being made available to
 it, both through charity and through
 public sources.
 The story is relatively complicated,
 but I have prepared a chronology as of
 Friday, June 26, which I ask unanimous
 consent to have printed at this point in
 the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the state-
 ment was ordered to be printed in the
 RECORD, as follows:               y~
 MEMORANDUM  RE  FINANCIAL         CONDITSON  OF
 CHILDREN'S  HOSPITAL:  CHRONOLOGY AS OF
 FRIDAY, JUNE 28
 1. The Senate added $110,000 to the de-
 ficiency appropriation for the District of
 Columbia for fiscal 1964 for reimbursement
 increases to Children's Ho; pital for care of
 indigents.
 2. The House knocked this out in confer-
 ence, and the conference reports were ap-
 proved in both Houses.  (See Washington
 Post story of June 4.)  But the statement
 of the managers on the part of the House
 said: "Deletes the proposal of the Senate to
 increase the rates paid to Children's Hos-
 pital.  The managers on the part of the House
 feel this matter should be the subject of
 consideration in connection with the regular
 District of Columbia appropriation bill for
 1965."
 3. In an excellent editorial, the Washing-
 ton Post on June 15 called upon the Commis-
 sioners, the administration, and Congress to
 save the Children's Hospital.
 4. Thereafter, on June 17, President John-
 son sent a message to the Congress contain-
 ing an amendment adding $160,000 to the
 District of Columbia appropriation request
 for fiscal  1965 to increase reimbursement
 rates'to Children's Hospital for care of in-
 digents.                                                                                (See text of message, and Wash-
 ington Post story of June 18.)
 5. This money is desperately needed, and
 it is crucial that the Appropriations Com-
 mittee act promptly to meet the request.
 But the $160,000 is only part of the story
 and will not solve the problems of the Chil-
 dren's Hospital created by its service without
 charge to indigent children in the com-
 munity.
 What is needed is to redefine the term
 "lndlgency" so that the hospital can be re-
 imbursed for caring for those who are in
 fact unable to pay, although they do not
 meet the present legal criteria of "indigency."
 (See the  excellent Washington Post edi-
 torial of June 19.)
 8. The true plight of Children's Hospital
 is hard to appreciate for anyone who is not
 closely familiar with the situation.  A real
 insight is supplied by President Kauffmann's
 snemnorandum, which is attached.
 Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent also to have the fol-
 lowing items printed at this point in the
 RECORD :
 First. A news story from the Wash-
 ington Post of June 14, 1964, entitled
 "Hill Conferees Reject Plea for Aid to
 Deficit-Hit Children's Hospital."
 Second. An editorial, also from the
 Washington Post of June 15, entitled
 "Unpaid Bills,"
 Third.  A communication from the
 President of the United States, trans-
 rnitting an amendment to the budget
 for, the District of Columbia.
 Fourth. A news story from the Wash-
 ington Post of June 18, entitled "L.B.J.
 Seeks Funds for Children's."
 Fifth. An  editorial  under  date of
 June 19, published in the Washington
 Post, entitled "To the Rescue."
 Sixth. A copy, of a"proposed draft of
 a special report to the board of directors
 on the state of the Children's Hospital.
 There being no objection, the material
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:

 HILL  CONFEREES REJECT  PLEA  FOR  AID  TO
 DEFICIT-HIT CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL
 (By Dorothy Gilliam)
 House-Senate conferees rejected a bid for
 help to financially ailing Children's Hospital
 yesterday despite pleas from House Speaker
 Joins W. MCCoaaACK, Democrat, of Massa-
 chusetts.
 Their action dashed hopes for relief for
 the hospital during the current fiscal year.
 It was understood that House conferees
 argued during the closed meeting that addi-
 tional money for the hospital would consti-
 tute payment of a subsidy to a private insti-
 tution and might create a precedent for
 other District hospitals.
 Senator JOHN O.  PASTORE,  Democrat, of
 Rhode Island, reportedly made a strong plea
 for the $110,000 request-part of the $1.4
 billion deficiency bill approved earlier by the
 Senate-which would have permitted the
 city to increase payments to the hospital for
 the care of needy children.
 The House-Senate conference referred the
 matter to the District Appropriations sub-
 committees of both Houses for action in the
 city's budget for the fiscal year beginning
 July 1.
 The House earlier denied the Commission-
 ers' $110,000 request, but the Senate approved
 funds to help in the hospital's financial
 emergency.  Rejection by the House-Senate
 conference came as a surprise because of
 House Speaker  MCCORMACK's  endorsement
 earlier this week.
 The hospital has a current operating defi-
 cit of $476,000.  The hospital board has au-
 thorized an emergency fund raising cam-
 paign to keep the institution open.                                                                                                                                  Dr.
 Robert Parrott, hospital director, yesterday
 expressed "surprise  and disappointment"
 over the conference action  and  said  the
 board would now have to "examine   very
 closely" what the hospital can do for needy
 children over the summer.
 "I would hope that the Appropriation Com-
 mittees of Congress," he said, "will examine
 the entire situation and take action in the
 upcoming fiscal year to allow the District
 government to assume a fuller part of its
 responsibility  for  the  care  of  District
 youngsters."

 THE UNPAID BILLS
 Under the lash of hard necessity, the Dis-
 trict Commissioners are at last considering
 the simplest and most obvious solution to the
 impending disaster at Children's Hospital.
 The city must reform the crabbed and per-
 verse rules that govern a child's eligibility
 for medical aid.
 Children's Hospital loses about $300,000 a
 year in the unpaid bills of children who are
 indigent by every definition but the Health
 Department's.  Unlike the city's own clinics,
 the hospital cares for sick children regard-
 less of their eligibility for medical aid.  The
 hospital's deficit is currently running above
 half a million dollars a year, and within a few
 months the hospital will be as destituteas
 the least prosperous of its patients.
 Out of over 100 children whom the hospital
 admits as indigents, the Health Department
 considers only about 50 to be eligible for
 public medical aid.  The hospital cares for
 the others, certainly, but the whole cost of
 that care is borne by the hospital itself.
 Thirty out of every hundred indigent pa-
 tients  are  ineligible                                                                                                                                because  the  Depart-
 ment's family unit rule creates a void of
 responsibility. Under the law, a child's par-
 ents are responsible for the hospital bill.
 Under the family unit rule, any relative liv-
 ing in the same house is responsible.  In a

 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, ' I ask
 unanimous consent that there be printed
 at this point in the RECORD a column ap-
 pearing in tonight's Evening Star by Max
 Freedman,  entitled  "Three  Senators
 Agree on Vietnam."
 There being no objection, the column

 quly 1, 19641
 THREE  SENATORS  AGREE  ON  VIETNAM-FUL-
 BRIGHT, HUMPHREY,  CHURCH BELIEVE U.N.
 SHOULD DEFER ANY INTERVENTION
 (By 'Max Freedman)
 In the     Senate the other day Senator
 CHURCH started a debate that soon spread to
 a discussion of the United Nations and the
 war in Vietnam.  He did not intend to, pro-
 voke such a discussion; he really wanted to
 speak up in support of the United Nations
 and to protect it from attack by people like
 Senator GOLDWATER.  But the mere mention
 of Vietnam was enough to stir is lively debate.
 The first point to be noted about this
 discussion was that only Democrats took part
 in it.  Senator GOLDWATER has tried to break
 the Republican Party into organized opposi-
 tion to the way the Johnson administration,
 has been behaving in Vietnam; but thus far
 his success has been negligible.  The Repub-
 licans cannot shake out of their minds the
 warning by Ambassador Lodge that America's
 involvement in Vietnam dates back to the
 Eisenhower administration and since then
 has been supported by both parties.  It is
 utterly unconvincing for Senator GOLDWATER
 to pretend now that he or any other Re-
 publican has a solution which is being will-
 fully ignored by the folly of Washington.
 As the debate showed, most Senators are
 not  concerned with the morbid review of
 wrong turnings and past mistakes.  They are
 more eager to prevent a bigger and more
 ruthless war, and nowhere is this anxiety
 stronger than in the Democratic Party.
 That was the theme common to Senators
 CHURCH, FULBRIGHT, HUMPHREY, PELL, PROX-
 MIRE,  and MORSE.  An exception, however,
 must be made of Senator MORSE.  He has ad-
 vanced the grave charge that the American
 program in Vietnam "violates one interna-
 tional commitment after another."                                                                                  He com-
 mands no support for this view which is a
 libel  on  America  advertised  with  all  the
 authority that belongs to a senior Senator.
 Regardless  of  what  else  may have      gone
 wrong,  it is  perverse  and mischievous    to
 regard the United States as the bandit na-
 tion in Vietnam.                                                                                    Senator MORSE should drop
 this argument before it sinks him incurably
 in the respect of the American people.
 It is more useful to concentrate on Senator
 FULBRIGHT and Senator HUMPHREY.  In Sen-
 ator  FULBRIGIIT'S  judgment,  the  essential
 task now is to stabilize the military situa-
 tion as the prelude to any political Initia-
 tives that may yet be taken.    At present he
 sees no great role for the United Nations
 in putting an end to the struggle.  But he
 does  not exclude  a possibility  later.   "If
 conditions should arise," Senator FULBRIGHT
 told the Senate, "in which it would be feasi-
 ble for the United Nations to take over and
 maintain order, I would be in favor of that."
 Senator HUMPHREY, trying to put at rest
 all fears of a larger war, said "I do not favor
 accelerating the war.   I believe I can say
 this Government does not."  He agreed with
 Senator FULBRIGHT that one day the influ-
 ence of the United Nations might well be
 both timely and constructive.
 Quite plainly Senator CHURCH  had im-
 pressed his colleagues by his warning against
 any new policy that would commit the United
 States to military attacks on Vietnam and
 military decisions that might also provoke
 a clash with China.  No one dissented from
 his warning that we must ponder our next
 steps very carefully "if we are to avoid a
 tragic trail of casualties in Asia out of all
 proportion to the vital interests of the United
 States."
 Some weeks ago great interest was taken
 in the announcement that Harlan Cleveland,
 who is in charge of United Nations affairs
 for the State Department, would attend the
 Honolulu Conference to review the problems
 of Vietnam and southeast Asia.  It was gen-
 erally felt that his presence' in Honolulu
 would focus attention on what the United
 Nations could do to end the danger of a
 spreading war.
 As it turned out Mr. Cleveland was unable
 to leave Washington because sudden anxieties
 over Cyprus kept him here.  But that does
 not mean that he and his officials are avoid-
 ing the close and continuous study of what
 the United Nations can do, at the right
 time, to promote stability and peace in this
 whole restless area.
 Mr.  MORSE.  I  shall  proceed  to
 answer that column by Mr. Freedman in
 respect to its references to the senior
 Senator from Oregon. In the course of
 the column Mr. Freedman says:
 As the debate showed, most Senators are
 not concerned with the morbid review of
 wrong  turnings and past  mistakes.  They
 are more eager to prevent a bigger and more
 ruthless war, and nowhere is this anxiety
 stronger than in the Democratic Party.
 That was the theme common to Senators
 CHURCH,    FULBRIGHT,    HUMPHREY,  PELL,
 PROXMIRE and MORSE.  An exception, how-
 ever, must be made of Senator MORSE.                                                                                                        He
 has  advanced  the  grave  charge  that the
 American program in Vietnam "violates one
 international commitment    after  another."
 He   commands  no   support  for   this view
 which is a libel on America advertised with
 all the authority that belongs to a senior
 Senator.  Regardless of what else may have
 gone wrong, it is perverse and mischievous
 to regard the United States as the bandit
 nation in Vietnam.  Senator MORSE should
 drop this argument before it sinks him in-
 curably  in  the  respect  of  the  American
 people.
 Mr. President, Mr. Freedman should
 get out to the- hustings. Mr. Freedman
 should acquaint himself with American
 public opinion.  For the benefit of Mr.
 Freedman, I incorporate by reference
 now every criticism that I have made of
 American foreign policy in southeast
 Asia, including the criticism to which
 he takes exception.
 In his column today in the Washing-
 ton Star Max Freedman undoes all the
 sound commentary he offered the Ameri-
 can people last week when he warned:
 Not even in his worst moments was John
 Foster Dulles ever guilty of such a crude and
 reckless act of brinkmanship as the one in
 which the Johnson administration has now
 stumbled.
 Of course, he published that column in
 the Washington Evening Star, which
 contained the editorial paying its dis-
 respect to' the senior Senator from
 Oregon. I answered it some days ago on
 the floor of the Senate. In my-reply to
 the editor of the Washington Star, I
 said that he should have read the column
 by Max Freedman published in the same
 issue that contained its editorial attack-
 ing the senior Senator from Oregon.
 It is interesting to note this complete
 change of journalistic coloring on the
 part of Mr. Freedman in so short a time.
 I wonder why.  Could it be that his
 editors did not like the fact that in that
 column he took the position of the sen-
 ior Senator from Oregon? As I pointed
 out, in that column Freedman laid down
 the major thesis of the criticism by the
 senior Senator from Oregon of shocking
 American  policy  in  southeast  Asia
 which, I repeat, in all probability, if it is
 not reversed, will lead us, into a major
 war in Asia.
 Today Mr. Freedman sounds fright-
 ened of his own analysis of our foreign
 policy in South Vietnam, which he pub-
 lished only a few days ago.  On June
 25 he pointed out that the threat of war
 made by administration officials against
 China "is more likely to divide and worry
 American opinion than it is to frighten
 Peiping or to serve the cause of peace."
 But that is the only logical end to a
 policy we are now following in southeast

 Asia. Our policy of military buildup and
 overwhelming economic aid to South
 Vietnam has failed to halt rebels suc-
 cesses.  The next step was to threaten
 expansion of the war if the Communists
 did not voluntarily retreat.
 The Government of the United States
 is threatening war in Asia,  Let those
 who believe it is not stand up and deny
 it, for we cannot read the statements of
 this Government, from the President on
 down, and fail to recognize that those
 statements add up to a threat to war
 prosecuted by the United States in Asia
 unless Red China, Laos, North Vietnam
 and other areas do the bidding of the
 United States.
 Having made the threat, we will have
 no choice but make good on it when the
 Communists decline to retreat. This en-
 tire policy depends upon Ho Chi Minh
 and Mao Tse-tung backing down before
 a threat that if they do not, their terri-
 tory will be attacked by the United
 States.
 One may as well expect the United
 States to leave Vietnam upon threat of
 dire consequences if we do not.
 Mr. Freedman is also frightened of
 the concept that the United States is
 itself violating international agreements
 in southeast Asia. And we are. He does
 not deny that we are. He does not try
 to show that our actions are in conform-
 ity with the Geneva accords of 1954, or
 1962,  or  with  the  United  Nations
 Charter, because that is impossible. He
 merely puts a nasty label on anyone who
 does point out the bitter truth of the
 U.S. illegal action in southeast Asia-
 illegal -action in southeast Asia that vi-
 olates the United Nations Charter in
 articles 33, 36, 37, and 51-to mention
 only four specific instances of our vi-
 olation.
 Let Mr. Freedman or anyone else deny
 it.  They cannot deny it if they can read
 the English language.  The language is
 perfactly clear as to the obligation of
 any signatory to that Charter and the
 course of procedural action that should
 follow whenever peace is threatened
 anywhere in the world.  Peace is seri-
 ously threatened in southeast Asia, and
 the responsibility of the United States
 is clear.  We should take the threat to
 the United Nations, and not set our-
 selves up as the policeman of the world,
 self-appointed, to enforce our interpre-
 tation of existing treaties such as the
 Geneva accords.
 Mr. Freedman may as well try to
 prove that the United States has the
 legal right to enforce a treaty between
 Russia and China as to prove that we
 have a unilateral right to enforce the
 Geneva accords of 1954, when we are
 not a party to them.
 Who are we to set ourselves up as the
 enforcement country of the Geneva-ac-
 cords of 1954 when we did not even sign
 the accords, and when John Foster
 Dulles used his influence to prevent
 South Vietnam from signing them?
 When we recognize that a violation of
 a treaty is threatening the peace of the
 world, this country has a clear duty to
 file charges before the United Nations.
 That the United States has not done. I
 wonder why.  I wonder if it might be
 that if the United Nations took jurisdic-
 tion it would find plenty of illegality on
 the part of the conduct of the United
 States to date in the course of action it
 has been following in southeast Asia?
 Mr. GRUENING.  Mr. President, will
 the Senator yield?
 Mr. MORSE. I yield to the Senator
 from Alaska.
 Mr GRUENING. I will confess I was
 also surprised at the abrupt about-face
 change in the attitude of Mr. Freedman
 from his previous article, in which he
 supported the view that the senior Sen-
 ator from Oregon and I have been ad-
 vocating, that we should stop our par-
 ticipation in the war in southeast Asia
 and try to wage peace; that it was a war
 we could not win militarily; that it was
 a war in which we should not have en-
 gaged in the first place; and that we
 should go to the United Nations and
 try to find a solution there.
 Mr. Freedman published a column
 earlier, which either the senior Senator
 from Oregon or I put in the RECORD, to
 that effect. I am interested in the sud-
 den change, What happened in between
 the publication of the two articles?
 Mr. MORSE. We have our suspicions.
 Mr. GRUENING. I can think of vari-
 ous explanations.
 Mr. MORSE.  But they would not re-
 dound to the credit of Mr. Freedman.
 Mr. GRUENING.  I do not know that
 I can comment on that; but, in any
 event, I think it is a regrettable change
 of attitude and an inconsistency that it
 would be useful for the columnist to ex-
 plain to his readers.
 Mr. MORSE.  For the edification of
 Mr. Freedman, I repeat again that the
 United States is violating one interna-
 tional agreement after another by our
 policy in southeast Asia.  We have al-
 ready violated the 1954 Geneva agree-
 ment, and have been found in violation
 by the International Control Commis-
 sion.                                               We have admitted to violations of
 the Geneva accords of 1962, with the
 excuse that some one else violated them
 first.
 This country has even sent into Laos
 armed military planes that have dropped
 bombs, which constitutes an act of war
 and aggression.  It is a clear violation of
 the Geneva accord of 1962, which this
 country signed, and which I believe
 thereby constitutes an even more serious
 reflection on the United States.  We
 have freely admitted to these violations,
 pointing out only that North Vietnam
 violated them first.
 Our violations of the United Nations
 Charter, as I have pointed out time and
 time again in the past several weeks,
 have been many, and they are continuing
 up to the moment I speak.
 The very assumption of Freedman and
 those he quotes that someday, sometime,
 somehow, and under some other cir-
 cumstances, the United States will seek    Mr. President, whoever fights a war
 United Nations action is evidence that all 'without taking the matter to the United
 of them know the issue is one of U.N.
 jurisdiction.
 What they are all saying is only that
 they do not think that to adhere to the
 U.N. Charter now would serve American
 interests.
 Are we to take the position that this
 country is being a peace-abiding nation;
 that we are going to resort to its obliga-
 tions under treaties and international
 law only when we think to do so would
 serve our interests?  If every country
 takes that position, that is the end of in-
 ternational law. International law then
 ceases to be of any force or effect in
 maintaining peace in the world, and be-
 comes nothing but a sham and a shib-
 boleth.
 But when, under that type of interna-
 tional expediency, would this country
 ever take such a matter to the United
 Nations? Would we do it when war has
 engulfed North Vietnam?  Do we think
 that when China is faced with the same
 situation she was faced with in Korea
 she will do what we have refused to do,
 and take the issue to the United Nations?
 If we set such an example, we set the
 precedent for other nations to defy their
 obligations under international law.
 Do we think that Red China will be
 willing to go to the U.N. or to the bargain-
 ing table when the war goes against her,
 although we refused to do so under the
 same circumstances?
 What a folly!  What a poor, lame,
 pathetic excuse for a war in Asia!  "Now
 is not the time to negotiate; wait until
 we dominate the battlefield and then we
 will negotiate."  If countries follow that
 course of action, there will be no sense in
 talking about resorting to the rule of law
 for settlement of issues that threaten the
 peace of the world. We shall then prove
 that our objective is to return to the
 jungle law of American military might.
 I can see the United States going to the
 United Nations or the conference table
 had Russia come to dominate the Carib-
 bean in 1962.
 Mr. President, if we are going to take
 the position that the time to negotiate
 does not exist until we dominate the
 battlefield, then when we dominate the
 battlefield of southeast Asia, Red China
 will throw all she has into southeast
 Asia.
 Remember this about our policy in
 Asia: A nation does not have to commit
 the first violation in order to be in vio-
 lation of the Geneva accords.  And it
 does not have to commit aggression in
 order to be in violation of the United
 Nations Charter; and all the journalistic
 squirming and weaseling by the Freed-
 mans cannot change that ugly fact and
 that sad indictment against the United
 States.
 We have violated these accords and
 the United Nations Charter time and
 time again.  We are pursuing neither law
 nor peace in Asia.  We are not even pur-
 suing freedom.                                                                                                  We are maintaining a
 military, tyrannical dictatorship over the
 South Vietnamese, headed by an Ameri-
 can puppet to whom we give the orders,
 Nations, is in violation of the charter,
 whether that party started the war or
 not.
 The United States cannot hide itself
 behind the alibi that we are not the only
 ones who are violating the Geneva ac-

 cords and the United Nations Charter.
 Of course we are not.  The Communists
 in Asia are violating international law,
 too; but since when can the United States
 justify an act of illegality because some-
 one else is committing an act of illegal-
 ity?             The fact that North Vietnam and
 the Communists in Laos and Red China
 are also threatening the peace in Asia
 does not justify our walking out on our
 international obligations.  To the con-
 trary, it makes it more important that
 we lay the charges before the United
 Nations, or go to a 14-nation Conference,
 or seek to get SEATO to come in and
 exercise peacekeeping policies until the
 United Nations can take over jurisdic-
 tion.
 That has been the thesis of the Sena-
 tor from Oregon for weeks. It will con-
 tinue to be my thesis so long as my coun-
 try follows its course of outlawry in
 southeast Asia.  "Outlawry," I remind
 Max Freedman, means outside the law,
 and our policy in Asia today is outside
 the law.
 Mr. Freedman's column today some-
 how carries all the overtones and pathos
 of the diplomats and generals who led
 their countries into World War I.  It
 was always going to be the other side
 that was going to back down in the face
 of a magnificent navy or army or mili-
 tary machine, and any treaty that was
 inconvenient to national interests became
 "just a scrap of paper."
 I never thought the time would come
 when my country would treat existing
 treaties as scraps of paper. My country's
 violation of the Geneva accords,. of the
 United Nations Charter, and the Con-
 stitution itself, reflect the attitude of
 treating international obligations and
 constitutional obligations as scraps of
 paper.
 Some of us have liked to think that
 the championing of the League of Na-
 tions by Woodrow Wilson, and later our
 active sponsorship of the United Nations
 marked an American commitment to the
 rule of law in world affairs, including
 our own interests in world affairs.
 What we are doing in Asia is setting
 the United States above all that. Once
 we have decided an American interest
 was at stake, we have ignored our treaty
 obligations and our obligations to the
 United Nations.  We have cranked up
 the American military machine to move
 into Asia.
 The apologists who piously deplore
 spreading the war, but who in the mean-
 time want to continue it in South Viet-
 nam and Laos, rather than negotiate,
 are scarcely different from those who
 want to expand it.  The war in South
 Vietnam is not going to get better for us.
 Perhaps it will not get any worse but I
 see no chance that it will get better.
 And the longer it continues under those
 circumstances, the more certain it is that
 the war will be expanded.
 If a nation wants to live up to its in-
 ternational commitments, it must live up
 to them and not find excuses for avoid-
 ing them. The only policy in the world
 I am advocating for the United States
 is that we live up to the Geneva Accords
 and the U.N. Charter.
 No. 132-28
 For Mr. Freedman's benefit, I repeat
 the language to which he takes such ex-
 ception:  The United States is violating
 one international commitment after an-
 other.
 So we are.
 GEN. MAXWELL D. TAYLOR, U.S.
 AMBASSADOR TO SOUTH VIETNAM
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, the last
 point I wish to make deals with the ac-
 tion taken by the Senate today in con-
 firming the nomination of General Tay-
 lor as American Ambassador to South
 Vietnam.
 When the Senate took that action-
 and I understand there were only a few
 Senators  on  the  floor  when  it  took
 place-I was downstairs in the Commit-
 tee on Foreign Relations presenting an
 argument against a shocking waste of
 taxpayer funds in a foreign aid program
 that is in need of drastic revision.
 I was not aware that the Taylor nom-
 ination was to be brought up at that
 time.  It was well known that I voted
 against the confirmation of the Taylor
 nomination in committee.  I wish briefly
 to say for the record that  I  think
 nominating General Taylor as American
 Ambassador to South Vietnam was a
 most unfortunate mistake, and for the
 following reasons:
 First, it is known around the world
 that General Taylor was one of the
 architects, along with McNamara and
 Rusk, of the war plans of the United
 States in Vietnam.
 It is unfortunate that we should send
 as our Ambassador to South Vietnam a
 military leader-and a very able military
 leader he is, too-when all the world
 has its eyes turned to the hope for peace.
 The appointment of General Taylor as
 Ambassador to South Vietnam increases
 the possibility of our going into a full
 scale war in Asia if the Red Chinese
 and the North Vietnamese do not back
 down under American threats.
 I am also satisfied that General Taylor
 will not hesitate to advocate the escalat-
 ing of that war into North Vietnam and
 into Red China and into Laos if the Red
 Chinese do not quiver and quake and
 retreat.
 I have great regard for General Taylor
 as a military leader.  If we get into a
 war, I believe we shall find that most
 military  experts in this  country  will
 agree with the observation I now make,
 namely, that we probably have a no more
 able potential theater commander for
 that war than General Taylor.  But he
 has no place behind the desk of an
 Ambassador.
 There is a growing trend in this Re-
 public for the military to take over more
 and more policy determinations. I had
 hoped that we would make it more clear
 than it has been made to date that under
 our constitutional system it is not for the
 military to determine policy, but to carry
 out orders; and that American foreign
 policy should be determined by the civil-
 ian branch of the Government-by the
 President, his chief agent, the Secretary
 of State, and the Congress.
 The symbolism of putting this general
 behind an Ambassador's desk in South
 Vietnam is uncalled for and unfortunate.
 It will be subject to great misunder-
 standing, and will accrue to the great
 disadvantage of the standing of the
 United States in many parts of the
 world, particularly in the so-called un-
 derdeveloped nations.  I am satisfied
 that great fear is developing toward the
 United States in the underdeveloped na-
 tions.  They are beginning to see great
 differences between our preachments and
 our practices, and are beginning to raise
 questions about the hypocrisy of the
 United States in the field of foreign
 policy.
 Furthermore, I have heard General
 Taylor as a witness before the Foreign
 Relations Committee over a period of
 years.  He has demonstrated his great
 ability, his wide knowledge, and his ex-
 pertness in the field of military affairs.
 But he has never instilled any confidence
 in his ability in the field of foreign policy.
 How well I remember the stunning
 sh' ck that I suffered at the time of the
 Berlin crisis when, listening to General
 Taylor and General White, I came to
 realize that I was listening to two Amer-
 ican military leaders who would not
 hestitate to drop the nuclear bomb, as
 though that would settle any issue in-
 volving the peace of the world.
 General Taylor is among those in the
 Pentagon who has an itchy trigger finger
 when it comes to.the use of nuclear power
 in case we are challenged and our bluff
 is called.  I want to avoid those chal-
 lenges.                                                                                              I think one of the best ways to
 avoid those challenges is to have the
 United States stop bluffing, because we
 may have our bluff called.
 The sad thing is that if we do, a nu-
 clear war will be on, and there will be no
 victory.  I have no confidence whatever
 in General Taylor in the field of Ameri-
 can foreign policy. Taking his uniform
 off and putting him behind an Ambas-
 sador's desk will not change the fact that
 his orientation is the orientation of the
 military, not the orientation of civilian
 foreign policy.
 The symbolism of his appointment is
 most unfortunate. My President should
 have selected someone such as the man
 tie selected as Deputy Ambassador, Mr.
 Alexis Johnson, or some other outstand-
 ing career officer in the Foreign Service
 of the State Department, rather than to
 dip into the Pentagon and take a mili-
 tary general to direct American foreign
 policy in southeast Asia.
 As I said to Mr. Lodge in person yes-
 terday, when he appeared before the
 Committee on Foreign Relations, it is
 unfortunate that a former U.S. Ambas-
 sador to the United Nations, the former
 Ambassador of the United States to
 South Vietnam, should return to the
 United States and tell the American peo-
 ple, in effect, that the time is not pro-
 pitious for us to take the southeast Asia
 crisis to the United Nations.  I shall
 never be. able to understand how a
 former Ambassador to the United Na-
 tions could demonstrate such a complete
 failure to uphold our obligations under

 the United Nations Charter. If it were
 not so tragic, it would be amusing, when
 one considers the answer he has given to
 the proposal to go to a 14-nation con-
 ference, as recommended by the Presi-
 dent of France, Mr. de Gaulle. What are
 we afraid of? No one is suggesting that
 while we are at that 14-nation Confer-
 ence we should abandon southeast Asia.
 No one is suggesting that while the Se-
 curity Council and, if necessary, the
 General Assembly consider the United
 Nations jurisdiction, we remove ourselves
 from southeast Asia, although I wish we
 would desist from our warmaking in
 southeast Asia and start a policy of
 peacekeeping.
 I would, as I have said so many times,
 while the matter is before a 14-nation
 Conference,  as  recommended by  De
 Gaulle, or before the Security Council or
 before, the General Assembly, call upon
 our alleged-and I underline the word
 "alleged"-SEATO allies to join us with
 a sufficient body of men to patrol the
 area, to keep the adversaries separate,
 and to stop the killing and warmaking
 until the procedures of the United Na-
 tions can be brought to work upon the
 threat to the peace of Asia and, poten-
 tially, the peace of the world.
 The position taken by Henry Cabot
 Lodge cannot be reconciled to any de-
 gree with the clear international obliga-
 tions of the United States under the
 United Nations Charter.
 I did not expect that the stature of the
 President of France for peacekeeping
 would rise above the stature of the Pres-
 ident of the United States: but at this
 hour, that is exactly what is happening.
 The President of France is becoming
 recognized in many areas of the world as
 more determined and dedicated to the
 cause of peace than the President of the
 United States, because the President of
 France is calling for negotiation.  The
 President of France is calling for the
 conference table.  The President     of
 France is calling for the application of
 the rule of law to the threat of peace in
 Asia.
 The President of the United States is
 rattling the saber and telling the world
 that we are willing to risk war with Red
 China unless Asia accepts American
 policy in southeast Asia.
 I cannot understand why my Govern-
 ment cannot see, before it is too late,
 that that kind of warmaking policy on
 the part of the United States spells
 trouble.   Let me make it clear, as I
 close, that there is no question that we
 are joined in our outlawry by South
 Vietnam, by North Vietnam, by the
 Pathet Lao Communists in Laos, and by
 Red China.
 Does that justify our outlawry?  Does
 that justify the policy of expediency ap-
 plied to international affairs which best
 describes American policy tonight in
 Asia?  Does the end-justifies-the-means
 principle square with American precepts
 of foreign policy?
 Since when `do two wrongs make a
 right?
 Never before has that been our pol-
 icy.          I pray again that my country will
 see the horrendous mistake it is making
 in Asia as a matter of policy, before it
 is too late.
 I close by saying, for the benefit of
 those who do not like my speeches and
 for the benefit of such journalists as
 Mr. Freedman, "You had better check
 it with the American people."
 1: am satisfied that millions of fellow
 Americans, as they begin to understand
 the issue at stake in southeast Asia, will
 support my position.
 I can now say, along with the Senator
 from Alaska, that my mail is running
 better than 100 to 1 in support of my
 position.  My mail is coming in from
 coast to coast, as Senators will see some
 samples placed in the  CONGRESSIONAL
 RECORD from time to time.  I placed a
 large quantity in the RECORD today. It
 is coming from the leaders of many com-
 munities in this country.
 I wish to state to President Johnson
 that I am satisfied that the American
 people do not approve of America's war-
 making policy in Asia, and that the
 American people wish the President of
 the United States to join with the Presi-
 dent of France and other advocates of
 negotiation, that we go to the conference
 table and seek to apply the rule of law
 to the crisis which exists in Asia.
 I say most respectfully to my Presi-
 dent, whom I shall continue to support
 on most issues, that I oppose him on this
 issue only because I owe a greater trust
 to my country than I owe to him.
 Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 tionally supported the hospital or a much
 broader, public type, appeal.  The board of
 directo`s of the hospital believes that such
 an additional appeal would receive much
 greater reception if the effort were to be
 matched closely by the Government's as-
 suming its fair share of the financial burden
 for the; medical care of the poor.
 CAN NAjIONI . cAPITA,L  AFFORD NOT TO, HAVE
 &tAJQR C, IILD IT g CENTER?
 In the final analysis there are the ques-
 tions: Can the Nation's Capital continue to
 afford a specialized institution devoted to
 the all around medical care. of children?
 Also, what will happen if Children's Hospital
 ceases to exist 1x1 its. present for?
 The answer to these questions lies at the
 heart of the matter.
 Of all places in the world, the Nation's
 Capital should feel that it can afford to
 travel first class in this respect.  Children
 deprived of the corrective health measures
 that . modern Ir,}edicine is capable of pro-
 viding may grow up to cause the community
 vast expense in terms of institutional care
 for adolescents and adults, In terms of de-
 linquency and crime, in terms of unem-
 ployment brought about by physical and
 mental ?handicaps.  Such ills can be pre-
 vented if the skills represented by the core
 of dedicated men and women brought to-
 gether on a team basis such as those at
 Children's Hospital are brought to bear on
 a solution to these problems at an incipient
 stage.
 This kind of child health care is available
 and needed and used at Children's Hospital
 now, not only by the indigent family but
 by families at, all income levels, including
 those on the Government payroll.  It is used,
 for example, by the families of Members of
 Congress and of the diplomatic corps.
 The hospital and its various programs
 have been selected for visits by royalty,
 visiting statesmen and professional persons
 from all over the, world.
 Infants and children In families who may
 not even have heard of the hospital have
 benefited indirectly from its presence by
 and through the fact that it _ is training
 doctors and nurses in the finest of child
 health practice, is carrying out research to
 understand and combat children's problems.
 But the Nation's Capital is beset by many
 problems.  It maybe that the specific prob-
 lems of the future existence of Children's
 Hospital in its present form-a children's
 medical center, evolved through nearly a
 century of devotion to child health into the,
 force for good in the community that it
 now is-cannot be salvaged in the context
 of life as it exists in the Nation's Capital
 today.

 what amounts to a last resort.  If it falls of von'e the possibility, however doubtful

 REPUBLICAN STATEMENT OF AMER-
 ICAN POLICY ON VIETNAM
 Mr. COOPER,  Mr. President, a few
 minutes ago the distinguished majority
 leader [Mr. MANSFIELD] commented up-
 on the statement made by some 55 Re-
 publicans in the House on Vietnam.
 I have read the statement.  I do not
 agree with one portion of it, at least.
 That portion is, as I remember, that it
 recommended that American command-
 ers should take command of the Viet-
 namese troops.  I rise nevertheless to
 say-as I happen to be one of the few
 Republicans on the floor at this time-
 that I believe this statement, whether
 the Senator agrees with it or not, or I
 do, brings into play the very debate that
 he, himself has recommended, that Viet-
 nam should be discussed, and discussed
 openly and objectively.
 I might also say, without any attempt
 to compare this particular statement
 with other statements that have been
 made in the Senate, that policy in Viet-
 nam has been discussed on the floor of
 the Senate for months. Some Members
 of the majority, have been, almost daily,
 very critical of the administration's po-
 sition on Vietnam. The majority leader,
 himself, has an alternative to the pro-
 gram of the administration in Vietnam.
 I would not want to stop by making
 these comments. I believe that it is nec-
 assary to maintain the strength of our
 troops in Vietnam, a strength capable of
 maintaining our position.
 I believe also that every possible alter-
 native should be considered which would
 be helpful.  I would advocate a convo-
 cation of the Geneva Conference, not
 with the purpose of agreeing to neutrali-
 zation, but with the purpose of seeing if
 there is any possibility of any agreement
 that would recognize two separate, sov-
 ereign countries, and support for the
 position, and support against the con-
 tinued aggression and subversion of
 North Vietnam. Thus could lead, I hope,
 to the establishment of multilateral pa-
 trols along the borders.
 der certain circumstances, to a recon-
 vening of the Geneva Conference of 1954
 covering the situation in Vietnam and the
 other parts of what used to be known as
 French Indochina. But I certainly can-
 not imagine the Senator from Kentucky,
 with his wide experience as a diplomat,
 as a member of the State Department,
 and as a member of the U.S. delegation
 to the United Nations, agreeing to a pro-
 posal which would make that a war un-
 der direct American military command
 and control in a foreign country.
 Mr. COOPER, I just said that I did
 not agree with such a suggestion. I said
 that the majority leader took occasion
 to criticize the proposal, which I do not
 agree with; but I must say that almost
 every day Senators, on his side are dis-
 agreeing with the administration posi-
 tion.
 Mr. MANSFIELD. The Senator is cor-
 rect.
 Mr. COOPER.  The majority leader
 himself has offered alternatives, con-
 structive proposals, I believe that alter-
 natives should be constructive.
 Mr. MANSFIELD. As I said in my re-
 marks, I welcome discussion. All I hope
 is that the discussion will be construc-
 tive. I do not care for opposition on the
 part of either Republicans or Democrats
 for the sake of opposition.  If a Sena-
 tor is'going to oppose, he should come
 forth with a constructive alternative, if
 he finds fault with a policy which the Na-
 tion has in effect at the time he makes
 his remarks or offers his solution.
 Mr. JAVITS.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  I yield.
 Mr. JAVITS.  I wish to address myself
 to the subject under discussion.  I am
 grateful to the majority leader for re-
 maining while I do so. It is interesting
 that the report of the task force on the
 part of the Republican Party in the
 House is side by side with the report of
 Ambassador Lodge to the people of the
 United States and to the President.  I
 wish to identify myself with that group
 which believes, regardless of party, that
 we must stick it out in Vietnam.  I do
 not believe that we ought to pull out. I
 believe there is to much at stake for us
 to pull out.  Also I do not believe that
 we should overtly extend the war into
 North Vietnam, which has been recom-
 mended by some. I feel that while Sena-
 tors, as the Senator from Kentucky [Mr.
 COOPER]  has said, have every right to
 speak and should be encouraged to speak
 and have been encouraged to speak their
 views, I cannot accept the proposition
 that any American President would not
 wish to win a struggle in which American

 The hospital Is informed that the Govern-
 ment of the District of Columbia is pre-
 cluded from making exception to the pre-
 vailing strict rules of eligibility for health
 care.  Presumably only Congress itself can
 order relief from losses in this category by
 specifically exempting the medical care of
 children from the eligibility rules.  If the
 hospital Is to survive, or at least survive in
 its present form, relief of both sorts is neces-
 sary.
 INDIGENT  CARE VITAL I;ART  OF CENTER
 This immediately suggests an important
 question which the community not only has
 every right to ask but should ask:
 Why not send the patients who are caus-
 ing these losses and who in many commu-
 nities would be the responsibility of the tax-
 payer, to the city's public hospital, the Dis-
 trict of Columbia General Hospital?
 The answer to this question also falls in
 several parts:
 1. District of Columbia General Hospital
 already-is caring for a capacity patient load
 of children.
 2. Except under emergency conditions, the
 thousands of indigent children who are not
 eligible for Government reimbursement at
 Children's Hospital are not eligible for care
 at District of Columbia General Hospital.
 In fact, without Children's Hospital, there is
 no place to provide their health case needs
 under present regulations.
 '3. Thus, Children's Hospital cares for as
 many, and in some cases more, sick children
 who cannot pay for their care than does
 District of Columbia General Hospital.   It
 serves the northerly sections of the city for
 Government-eligible patients  in the same
 way as District of Columbia General serves
 the southerly sections of the city.   It is,
 therefore, the other half of facilities for such
 care and traditionally has been treated as the
 privately operated half of a public-private
 partnership devoted to caring for the city's
 sick poor children, having been expanded
 and modernized to do the job by the Invest-
 ment of over $2 million of matching Govern-
 ment funds in recent years.  There is no
 "third" place for them to go in any im-
 portant numbers.
 4. Children's Hospital has been planned
 and staffed and its plant has been financed
 to do this job.  In fact it was doing it as the
 sole such institution _ in the District of Co-
 lumbia before the creation of a children's
 unit at District of Columbia General Hos-
 pital.  Perhaps it should be compared to an
 eight-cylinder   automobile;   its  operation
 could hardly be cut in half by removing four
 of the cylinders, and it is doubtful it would
 run at all In such a condition.     To put it
 another way, Children's Hospital's ability to
 perform the charity task is built into its total
 function as a children's medical center pro-
 viding the finest of health care for all types
 of patients, including those who can pay.
 Thus, if the institution remains prepared to
 meet fully the child health needs of the
 community, It is doubtful that important
 savings could be realized from simply turn-
 ing away sick children even if they arrived at
 the door properly tagged "eligible" or "in-
 eligible" which, of course, they do not.
 6. In order to carry out the care of the
 charity patients at less expense and to pro-
 vide a stimulus to Improved care for all pa-
 tients and to  fulfill  a responsibility as a
 complete medical center, the hospital has,
 over the years, developed some of the coun-
 try's best recognized training and research
 programs in child health.  While the pres-
 ence of teaching programs allows the charity
 care to be carried out at lesser cost, it is
 also true that the presence of charity or
 "ward" patients allows a sttonger teaching
 and research program.  A significant  cut-
 back in charity patients would in proportion
 diminish the strength of the teaching and
 research programs as well  as narrow the
 spectrum of available health care services.
 And, at some point, it could no longer serve
 as well the purpose of educating young doc-
 tors and nurses.  It might no longer attract
 and hold highly skilled specialists who gravi-
 tate to an institution because of teaching
 and research opportunities thus concentrat-
 ing for the benefit of the entire community
 in one place a central pool of specialized
 medical skills.  If Children's Hospital were
 bereft of this concentrated team of special-
 ists there would be little real justification
 for its existence.  That function could just
 as well be fulfilled by adding beds for chil-
 dren at each of the general hospitals of the
 community.
 Thus a specialty hospital like Children's
 is a meld of complex and interdependent
 parts.  Take one part away and the whole
 tends to fall apart and become, relatively
 speaking, a nonessential community asset.
 PROGRAMS GEARED FOR PAYING PATIENTS AS WELL
 AS INDIGENT
 At this point another question suggests
 itself: Why does not the hospital make more
 of an effort to attract more paying patients
 to meet the competition of the general hos-
 pitals, particularly suburban hospitals con-
 veniently located in higher income areas?
 The answer to this is that all of the pro-
 grams are intended to meet the needs of in-
 fants and children in the best possible way
 and thus to "attract" paying patients whose
 parents wish the best of medical and surgical
 care for their Infants and children despite
 certain Inconveniences of travel.
 Since World War II the facilities of the
 hospital,  including a  new main  building,
 research  center  and a modern diagnostic
 and    treatment  center   (together costing
 $5,800,741, $3,580,335 of it privately donated
 and $2,220,406 of it in matching Govern-
 ment funds) have been improved and ex-
 panded because the hospital recognized that
 changing times made it imperative that it
 equip itself to care for difficult and highly
 specialized cases in addition to routine cases
 that would gravitate inevitably to neighbor-
 hood hospitals.  Thus, it has laid the ground-
 work for maintaining a reasonable increase
 in private patient load.  But such a program
 bears fruit slowly.
 The medical board of the hospital is active
 in bringing to the attention of referring
 physicians the importance of having avail-
 able an institution qualified to cope with
 the difficult and complex ailments of chil-
 dren; also the importance of supporting such
 an institution despite considerations of con-
 venience.
 BROADER PUBLIC GIVING WOULD MATCH
 GOVERNMENT SUPPORT
 And, still another question is: Since Chil-
 drens' Hospital is a charitable institution,
 and, since private givers in the Washington
 area have proven themselves willing to sup-
 port it through their donations and bequests,
 why doesn't the hospital increase its efforts
 to obtain more such support from the com-
 munity?
 Once again, the answer must be complex
 rather than simple:
 The hospital has indeed increased its ef-
 forts over the past 3 years to solicit funds
 from individuals on the basis of a list of
 known friends and supporters of the institu-
 tion.  The list of contributors now includes
 the majority of those individuals who tra-
 ditionally and in the light of the trend to-
 ward unified appeals to support community
 charity can be expected to support such an
 institution in addition to their support of
 unified fund drives and their responsibility
 to the many other demands made upon their
 incomes by other worthwhile charitable, edu-
 cational and cultural institutions and or-
 ganizations.  The next step in any effort to
 supplement present  private  support  for
 Children's Hospital charitable work would
 have to be either a request for an increased
 level  of giving by those who have tradi-
 and presumably throughout its entire his-
 tory. After all, it was founded as a charitable
 institution.  And it has tried to conduct it-
 self as one, its board of directors having
 been guided by the statement in its original
 charter below:
 "Be it known to all whom it may concern,
 that we, * * * citizens of the United States,
 and of the District of Columbia, have as-
 sociated ourselves together pursuant to the
 provisions of the 3d section of the act of
 Congress, approved May 5, 1870, entitled "An
 act to provide for the creation of corporations
 in the District of Columbia by general law,"
 for the purpose of establishing a charitable
 institutionin said District, to be used as a
 hospital and dispensary for the treatment of
 the medical and surgical diseases of children,
 Where all such may be treated gratuitously:
 Provided, however, That the board of directors
 may provide for the admission of sick chil-
 dren whose parents or guardians may be will-
 ing and able to defray the expenses thereof."
 To implement this policy, and to fulfill
 its obligation to the community as set forth
 in Its charter, it has sought and obtained
 from generous friends and supporters sub-
 stantial funds.  Also it has received specific
 endowments and unrestricted bequests, made
 to it because it was a charitable institution.
 In the period covered by the statistics
 above, for instance, it sought and obtained
 annual donations through its annual sus-
 taining fund appeal and its annual Christ-
 mas card appeal as follows:

 ing fund and Christmas card appeal

 61,828
 And it received In this same period unre-
 stricted bequests totaling $837,642, more than
 half of which was required for day-to-day
 operations.
 To meet its deficits it has, of course, spent
 the revenues from these appeals.  It also has
 spent to finance its day-in-day-out opera-
 tions not only the income from an endow-
 ment fund of $1,243,479, but also all of the
 income from and $446,000 of the capital of
 funds, that have come to it In the form of
 unrestricted bequests.
 To sum up, it has been ready, willing, and
 able to spend nonoperatin& income and capi-
 tal in1 the period under review as follows:
 TABLE V. Expenditure of nonoperating in-
 come and capital for recent 5 years

 Year ending June 30, 1960 --------  367, 549
 Year ending June 30, 1959 --------  243, 075
 But the hard fact of the matter is that
 taking nonoperating income and capital from
 all available sources into account, it now
 finds Itself with only $143,000 to meet deficits
 that are averaging $40,000 each month.
 STOPGAP APPROPRIATION REQUIRED
 To find some way to avoid the Inevitable
 financial collapse of the hospital, the officers
 of the board of directors have taken their
 case to the Commissioners of the District of
 Columbia who have agreed to ask Congress
 for a supplemental appropriation of $110,000
 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1964. The
 amount of this request is bijsed on reimburse-
 ment for units of service Which the hospital
 provided solely for patients ruled eligible for
 tax support at a rate somewhat greater than
 that presently provided but less than the
 hospital's audited cost of care.  If this is
 granted it will provide only temporary relief.

 GRUENING I say please continue to speak out

 actions in Vietnam.
 Sincerely,

 I would also like to take this time to com-
 mend you, Senator MORSE, for your stand on
 civil rights.  Few people have ever been as
 consistently right on so many important is-
 sues as you have been. When history records
 these days it will be seen that you were one
 of the Senators most responsible for so strong
 yet just a bill being passed by Congress.
 I would like to pose several questions:
 1. Under cloture, I thought that only the
 civil rights bill would be discussed and that,
 for example, there would be no morning hour
 or no nongermane speech, even on the Sen-
 ator's time, would be allowed.  Which of
 these was the intent of the Senate?
 2. On Thursday, Jung 11, 1964 a modified
 Ervin amendment was passed 80 to 16.  It
 added a new section 1102 to the bill. Under
 this amendment, if a man commits a crime
 and has his day in court and then later com-
 mits the same crime can he be tried again?
 If originally he was tried for say, contempt
 arising under his first crime, can he, for the
 second crime, be tried for the crime itself?
 3. Briefly, if possible, what was the Mo-
 torola case?
 4. On 'The Making of the President, 1960"
 last week it mentioned your running for
 President against the then Senator Kennedy.
 I presume that this was in the Oregon pri-
 mary.  Is this correct and what was the
 results?
 Thank you. Senator MORSE, for letting me
 take some of your so valuable time.  Once
 again, please continue speaking out against
 our policy toward the war in Vietnam.
 Again, thank you very much.

 DEAR SIR: I live in Vancouver, Canada, and
 heard your interview with Station CJOR,
 Monday, June 4.  If I was a praying man I
 would flop down on my knees and thank
 God that there is a litle spark of sanity yet
 in the United States.  Everything you said
 was exactly according to facts and your es-
 timation as to the. solution right now also
 squares with the development and stage that
 the world is in, re the newly emerging na-
 tions and those waiting to be born, South
 America, etc.
 Your interviewer is still befuddled by cold-
 war semantics and brainwash.  Communism
 won't overrun or move into any country, no
 matter how small, until the present way of
 life has broken down and the people them-
 selves want a change.  I'm afraid time is
 running out on us and we need many more
 voices like yours with courage and under-
 standing to let their fellow Americans real.
 ize that they do not have this holy mission
 bestowed upon them to force their way of
 life on the rest of the world.  It wasn't
 humanly possible to make more blunders
 and mistakes than U.S. internal and foreign
 policy has and if they pursue this line, we
 surely 'face annihilation.
 Once more the thanks of many, many
 thousands of Canadians and surely men of
 good will all over the world for your brave
 stand against such great odds.
 it will be because of men like you, not little

 DEAR  SENATOR  MORSE: I should like to
 thank you for the fine stand you have taken
 on the Vietnam situation that we are now
 unfortunately involved in.  To begin with,
 our Government (or CIA) has no right in-
 fringing on other people's rights of self-de-
 termination.  Then, to claim that there are
 foreign invaders,  that the people ask for
 defense, and to go ahead and perpetuate a
 war fraught with dictatorships, torture, lies,
 and misinformation to the American people
 is a terrible disgrace.  Please continue your
 fine work.

 HON.  SENATOR                        MORSE:  We  fully  support
 your views as expressed on "Face the Nation"
 with regard to the war we are conducting
 against South Vietnam.                       We believe that in

 (as witness program of June 14, Marguerite

 ALGONAC, MICH., June 10, 1964.
 DEAR SENATOR MoRSE:I compliment you on
 your true and courageous statements re:
 our activities in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos,
 etc., today.
 It is many a day believe me since we have
 heard a Senator in U.S. Congress stand up
 and tell the truth as you did.
 It is a terrible thing when any people can
 no longer trust their government to tell the
 truth.  We are being lied to all along the
 line.
 Scully's argument was really something to
 behold-i.e., that we should not take the
 time to take on disgraceful adventure in
 Vietnam, etc., to the United Nations as that
 would give "the Communists time to take
 over."
 If the people of Vietnam think commu-
 nism more suitable to their needs than our
 famous "free enterprise" which is a polite
 name  for  monopoly  today,  then  all  our
 vicious war against those poor people will
 never  change their  minds   but  will  only
 strengthen their hatred of United States as
 indeed it should.
 Scully's assertion that we have not vio-
 lated                      our international  agreements     was
 sickening and idiotic-he can lie so brazenly
 because  he   knows  how brainwashed    the
 average American is by monopolistic control
 of all means of communications.
 As for that pathetic creature, Stevenson
 how can you adequately express the con-
 tempt any citizen can feel for him.
 But  thoughtful  people  are  profoundly
 thankful  for  men  like  you  and  Senator
 GRUENING and a few others (how pitifully
 few) and I'll bet your words today will be

 Senator WAYNE MORSE,

 I listened to your interview with Nancy
 Dickersen of NBC's "Today" program this
 morning-subject of "The War in Vietnam,"
 and I want to say my husband and I agree
 with every word you. spoke.
 More power to you and may you have some
 influence to stop our country from trying
 to police the entire Asian Continent.
 We can't dictate to our neighbors and I
 think as a country (of which we are proud)
 we should quit trying to dictate the policies
 of other nations.

 Hon. Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 The U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: May we congratulate
 you on your stand on South Vietnam.  We
 listened to you on the "Today" show and
 also FRANK CHURCH with the opposite view.
 We need more people like you to point the
 way back to our country's basic principles
 and our Constitution, especially to younger
 people in public office-FRANK CHURCH.  Our
 Constitution perhaps should be read in its
 entirety to each  Senator  every  6 months
 or so.
 We are with you all the way too on the
 failure of the United States to utilize the
 United Nations.   Most smaller nations and
 most Americans probably wonder why it
 hasn't been used.
 Congratulations again and best wishes
 for great success in your stand.

 work as effectively as you know how towards
 a more realistic Vietnam policy, and other

 It is a pleasure to read your speeches in

 You have my deepest gratitude for your

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I am very much in
 agreement with the stand you took with re-
 gard to the war in Vietnam.
 I doubt very much if we are making any
 true friends there in Vietnam and around
 the world by our presence there. Many peo-
 ple are shocked by our indiscriminate bomb-
 ing with. napalm and threats of atomic war-
 fare. We have defended the tyranny of Diem
 and bought our way in at that.  The people
 are tired of war and by our presence there
 it will prolong the strife and agony for years
 to come,
 We should remember what France paid in
 lives and money for years without any gain.
 I doubt if we will get any other countries
 to go along with us in this war.
 Let's take a long-range look at the situa-
 tion.               As you have said, the best thing we
 can do now is go to the -U.N.  This makes
 sense to me and the only wise move we can
 make at this time.
 We need more men of stature to stand up
 to the hotheads and the uninformed.  We
 need to make some long-range plans and
 "think the unthinkable."

 DEAR SENATOR: This is to tell you that we
 heard you on the "Today Show" and we ap-
 preciate your stand on the Vietnam problem.
 If we had 99 more men like you in the Sen-
 ate and 436 in the House with your convic-
 tions the rest of us humble citizens could
 rid ourselves of our national guilt and shame.
 We should understand that communism is
 an ideology and cannot be detained with
 bullets.  The Romans tried to suppress the
 Christians and failed.  The Christians tried
 to suppress the Moslems and they flourished
 faster than ever.  Now the Christians are
 trying to suppress communism and for every
 Communist they detain abroad, four Com-
 munists in sympathy are generated at home.
 For many long years these poor people in
 southeast Asia have tried to rid themselves
 of foreign impostors and now we, the most
 destructive of them, all, are in there to ruin
 their land and homes.  If we don't get out
 our Democratic Party isloing down. to de-_
 feat this fall election.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I have listened to
 your courageous talks against war several
 times with great admiration, but have not
 been courageous enough myself to write to
 you.  Your views on this unbelievable action
 in Southeast Asia and mine seem to be alike,
 Not only do I object to sending young
 American men there to die, but I object to
 their (or our) killing and burning those poor
 miserable  people  of  Vietnam  and  Laos.
 Like you, t am `very critical of my govern-
 Fment, and certainly do not support President
 Johnson's actions. I believe that President
 Kennedy grew with his position as presi-
 dent and would never 'have gone this far-
 even under' pressure.
 I am "not only gritical of this vicious be-
 haviour not only in Southeast Asia, but
 Cuba and South America-I am downright
 ashamed of it.  But, thank God, in you we
 have a man who is nit afraid to speak out.
 I hope everyone heard you speak on NBC

 two feet and tell the American people the
 truth about this (Vietnam) situation.  Get

 can be unending, and become a worldwide
 conflagration.  What has become Of Presi-

 DEAR MR. SENATOR: A foolish woman once
 insulted you by saying you had been kicked
 in the head by a horse.  If I could offer one
 suggestion for the future of American for-
 eign policy, it would be: Find that horse and
 set him loose in the Department of State.
 I listened to your presentation on the ABC
 television program "Issues and Answers"
 earlier this afternoon and then tuned in the
 NBC "Open Mind" program entitled "The
 Crisis in Vietnam."  In your half hour you
 made more sense on Vietnam and southeast
 Asia generally than the whole gang on "Open
 Mind"-including a Princeton professor, a
 pair of journalists (one foreign, one domes-
 tic), a foreign policy scholar, and the Special
 Assistant to the Secretary of State for Viet-
 namese Affairs-were able to achieve in 60
 dreary minutes.  Particularly valuable was
 your suggestion for combining a SEATO
 peacekeeping force with an emergency United
 Nations meeting, to be followed by a special
 UN force in that troubled land.  Here is a
 way for us to oppose a Communist takeover
 without resorting to a dime-store Machiavel-
 lianism that flouts our charter commitments
 to the United Nations, defies moral principle,
 offends Africa and Asia and Latin America,
 alarms our allies, tantalizes our enemies, and
 threatens a nuclear holocaust.
 Who can tell whether your suggestions
 will be followed?  I for one auk grateful that
 they have been given,
 Whether this Nation hears or- whether it
 forebears, keep speaking up.  Robert M. La
 Follette, who came into the, Senate 60 years
 15151
 ago next Januray, had to entitle one chapter
 of his autobiography "Alone in the Senate."
 A giant can stand alone when necessary.
 Persist.

 OPEN LETTER AD ASKS VIET NEGOTIATIONS
 An open letter to the State Department,
 signed by 69 Clevelanders from all walks of
 life   and  urging  negotiations  instead of
 stepped-up war in Vietnam, is published in
 the Plain Dealer today as a paid advertise-
 ment.
 The letter's publication has been timed to
 coincide with a foreign policy conference
 here today in which the State and Defense
 Departments are participating.
 "The signatures are of those persons we
 could readily reach within the last 10 days,"
 said Sheldon D. Clark, Cleveland lawyer and
 initiator of the open letter.
 "In my talks with fellow Clevelanders it
 was felt that a statement to the officials of
 the two Departments at this time afforded
 the best means of expressing ourselves as
 forcibly as we know how," Clark said.
 Scheduled to attend the all-day confer-
 ence in Hotel Sheraton-Cleveland are George
 W. Ball, Under Secretary of State, and John
 T. McNaughtoil of.the Defense Department,
 Acting Assistant Secretary for International
 Affairs.
 Among the signers of the open letter are
 Dr. Benjamin Spook of Western Reserve Uni-
 versity, an authority on child development;
 the Reverend Alan J. Davis, pastor of Alders-
 gate Methodist Church; the Reverend Dennis
 0.  Kuby, pastor of Unitarian Society of
 Cleveland; Paul Olynyk of Penn College, an
 advocate of a sane nuclear policy; Harold J.
 Quigley,  leader of the Cleveland Ethical
 Society; Jack G. Day, lawyer, active in civil
 rights cases; Sam Sponseller, retired labor
 leader, and Oscar H: Steiner, businessman.
 Money for the ad was raised by those who
 signed the open letter, Clark said.
 [From the Plain Dealer, June 18, 19641
 AN OPEN LETTER TO THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF
 STATE-NEEDED: AN APPROACH To END THE
 WAR IN VIETNAM
 The United States is a foreign party to a
 civil war in Vietnam,  Fifteen thousand
 U.S. uniformed personnel have been com-
 mitted to the battle.                                                                                                                        Casualties include
 American soldiers.
 Acceleration of the American war effort in
 South Vietnam invites increased aid by China
 to the Communist Vietnamese.  Stepping up
 the war effort risks the use by either side of
 nuclear arms.  Nuclear war offers no victory.
 What is the alternative?
 Negotiation is urged by Senator Wayne
 Morse, Senator Ernest Gruening, Columnist
 Walter Lippmann and others. Recognizing it
 takes both sides to make peace, we urge our
 Government to initiate a conference of na-
 tions to guarantee a neutral Vietnam.  We
 support U.S. efforts to insure enforcement of
 agreements.  The United Nations can assist
 direct negotiation.  Inspection teams must

 be free to operate wherever needed. They
 can be backed by frontier patrols.  The best
 guarantee of enforcement is the mutual ad-

 LITTLE Rocs, ARK.,
 June 24, 1964.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:  May I express my
 deep appreciation for the position you have
 consistently taken on the Vietnam situa-
 tion?  It seems you are oneof very few in the
 Senate who have taken this position, yet I
 believe most of the American people stand
 with you.
 It seems, sometimes, that the administra-
 tion has been goaded into its position by
 the Birchites, etc.  It can't be good politics
 and it certainly is not good foreign policy.
 The U.N. may have some business there but
 not the United States.  If these people are to
 be saved from communism what are they to
 be saved for?  Another Madame Nhu?
 In our country's foreign policy does every
 other country have to be either capitalist
 or Communist?  What's wrong with letting
 them decide.   If they decide to try some
 socialistic form of government then that is
 their business. I simply cannot subscribe to
 the thinking that our system is synonymous
 with right and that their system is synony-
 mous with wrong.  Why do we want to
 keep on being ugly Americans in the eyes
 of most of the citizens of the world?   We
 have been unsuccessful In making law-abid-
 ing citizens out of Mississippians (and oth-
 ers).  Who do we think we are in telling
 southeast Asia how to live?  A war there
 may never be lost but it Is certain it would
 never be won.
 Please coyltinue to do all In your power
 to let the President and others In positions of
 responsibility know what you think is right
 for America during these times.
 In appreciation,

 DEAR   SENATOR   MORSE: Have  seen  you

 ground on                all- America was  founded on.
 Don't we have enough red-blooded American
 Senators that would take a stand with you?
 Have you ever thought of running for the
 Presidency?  I believe you would do a good
 job for us-would like to see more of you on
 TV.
 JUNE 25, 1964.
 DEAR  SENATOR  MORSE: YOU  are  right in
 everything you said about the war in Viet-
 nam.  This is a United Nations and SEATO
 problem-not ours.                            We have no business
 policing Asia.  My son is over there and I
 want him home.   I hope you win your point
 and I am not alone.  I can produce dozens
 of families that feel as I do.  We are stick-
 ing our nose into other people's troubles and
 have enough of our own.  God bless you.

 DEAR SIR:  After hearing you talk on the
 "Today" show, June 25, I just want to tell you
 what you said makes sense in my opinion.
 I hope and pray that more Congressmen take
 the same position.
 On the "Today" show they announced after
 your interview that Senator CHURcH would
 be on the next day to give a different view
 of the situation but after hearing Senator
 CHURCH this morning it seems to me that
 he has just about the same opinion of the
 situation in southeast' Asia that you have.
 With all the problems in this country that
 we don't seem to be able to cope with I don't
 think we should be over on the other side
 of the world trying to solve problems.
 Jack Lescoulie on the "Today" show said it
 was surprising to him that people  didn't
 seem to know or care about this problem we
 have taken ori'as ours in southeast Asia, of
 course those are not his exact words but that
 was the general idea he was talking about.
 It is a shame that more of our people can-
 not be awakened to the need to be actively
 interested in what their lawmakers are doing.
 I am very thankful to the "Today" show for
 trying to help in this matter.

 It is an outrage to send our boys to be killed

 countries and the money we pour into Com-
 munist countries is outrageous.  If I had a
 son, I think I would rather he died a natural
 death than to send him to Vietnam. Do keep
 up your work and try and curb the ridiculous
 spending of life and money outside of the
 United States.

 U.S. Senate.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I have just heard
 your wonderful talk on the "Today" program
 over NBC.  I heartily agree that our boys
 should not be in Vietnam.  A little 4-year-
 old said to me "if you vote for a Democrat it
 means war."  How can we change that pic-
 ture and idea?                    I have voted Democratic since
 F.D.R. and I would like to be proud of my
 party, but how when we do the things that
 you outlined in your talk. May you have the
 courage, money, and stamina to keep airing
 these views.
 My heart is in this.  I have a son leaving
 for Korea in July.
 ,Sincerely,
 Mrs. MARTIN KESKIMAKI.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I have a feeling that
 yours must be a bitter and lonely lot-now
 in the first aftermath of the Asian crisis
 and your sublime response to it.  I put these
 few words on paper because I hope to dilute
 by an infinitesimal amount the abuse prob-
 ably inflicted on you.  I hope that you un-
 derstand that at least In the academic com-
 munities that you are a prophet with honor.
 Also that yours is not the ephemeral kind
 that comes and goes with political cam-
 paigns.  It is of the type that will be deeply
 engraven In the records of the history of
 our times.  I do not and cannot speak for
 the existing guild of historians, but I have
 sufficient experience to know that if there
 is a future-better than radioactive debris,
 you will be recorded as one of its major
 achievers.  You may be pleased to know
 that at least among my colleagues, each
 new crisis evoked by our insane stance leads
 us to say, almost instinctively that "Sen-
 ator MORSE will take a stand."
 I with that there was some simple, direct
 way to convey to you the admiration that
 I feel for your discharge of your high office.
 Were I a deeply religious person, it could
 be put as: "Thank God for WAYNE MORSE."
 As it is, there is only the statement, the
 historian# will ,write your name in the lot
 of those who deserved the most of the coun-
 trymen.
 Respectfully,
 ROBERT G. COLODNY,

 Senator WAYNE MORSE.
 DEAR SIR: Heard part of your discussion
 of South Vietnam and southeast Asia and
 TV this morning in answer to questions by
 newscasters.
 Most erudite, most reasonable, most log-
 ical, and factual discussion I have heard
 and the most authoritative devoid of emo-
 tionalism and politics.
 It was  also  a brave  explanation.   You
 will be accused of everything and a lesser
 light might even be accused of aiding the
 Communists if he had said the things you
 did.
 Also,  your  solutions are  based  on the
 Christian spirit of which our country boasts.
 I want to say that I wish we had more
 men and women fearless enough and intel-
 ligent enough and moral enough to fight
 for the things in southeast Asia and our
 role there as you have done.

 Hon. Senator MORSE,
 Senate Office Building,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Congratulations on
 your position and public statement relative
 to the Vietnam situation.
 It is indeed disturbing in time of peace,
 in a country In which "only Congress shall
 declare war," to have our Communist rid-
 dled State Department "arrange the war,"
 as I firmly believe they also did with Japan
 prior to Pearl Harbor.
 Is China such a threat to Russia that our
 pink darlings feel that it is our duty to
 take them "off the hook," or are they afraid
 that if Russia became entangled with China,
 that the Red satellites may get an oppor-
 tunity to free themselves?
 For God's sakb, do all possible to put the
 management of our  country back in the
 hands of our representatives, and out of the
 hands of our damnable State Department.
 Again, my thanks for men of your courage.
 Sincerely,
 Los ANGELES, CALlS'.,

 DEAR  SENATOR                           MORSE:  It was  very good

 Senator WAYNE MORSE,

 DEAR SIR: I would like to thank you for
 your courageous stand on South Vietnam.
 Most people that I know think it is a messy
 situation, but say they don't know enough to
 write or sign petitions.  There is a news-
 blackout here, and your views are not heard.
 Continue the good work.
 MISS CHARLOTTE GRANT.

 Mr. WAYNE MORSE,
 U.S. Senator.
 SIR AND GENTLEMAN: According to Pitts-
 burgh Press, "Washington Calling," column,
 15'1
 June 28, 1964, printed the following state-
 ment: "Senator WAYNE MORSE, Oregon Demo-
 crat,                                                                                                                                   who  disagrees  with  administration's
 Vietnam policy, is getting close attention
 from Communist news agencies. When he
 said he was convinced 'the greatest threat
 to the peace of the world is the United
 States,' the Communists broadcast his re-
 mark."
 Mr. WAYNE MORSE, when I enter the voting
 booth I vote independently of party labels
 or tags.  But I do say, and have said ever
 since World War I, that the United States,
 as  today's reading of events and actions
 since World War I, to the present day and
 time proves such a charge as most correct
 in all details.  And, Mr. MORSE, you don't
 have to be a Communist to see that.
 Instead of maintaining and expanding not
 only our respectability and leadership among
 the nations of the world's people, we as a
 nation have,  and  are, becoming a nation
 that is despised and hated by the world's
 exploited,  robbed, and  murdered  peoples,
 that was and is being accelerated by the
 hour, by and through the "cloak and dagger"
 organization-the CIA.
 Our Constitution which may not be the
 acme and omega of perfection, nevertheless,
 is  being  torn  asunder  and  our  personal
 liberties being obliterated one by one, every
 day.   We do not legislate by law today.  We
 legislate by committees, witch hunters, and
 inquisition, and thereby traveling the very
 same highway that Rome trod, and will meet
 the same destruction.
 In other words, we are fiddling while the
 United States burns.
 In closing, be prepared to be maligned,
 ridiculed, slandered, and reviled, even im-
 peached, if not murdered, if you stand by
 your guns, which is a fact.
 America as a country, is great, grand, and
 beautiful.   But surely Is  badly managed.
 And the present management better soon
 be changed to a better one.  Or there won't
 be anything worth, or too manage.
 I have been watching--and remonstrat-
 ing-at the hypocritical, wasteful destruc-
 tion of this country's resources and produced
 wealth since the  year 1884 and the only
 difference from then to now is we are travel-
 ing down the slope to chaos faster than logs
 down a mountainside.
 These  are  times  that  try  men's  souls.
 Are you and some others just summer sol-
 diers, or are you made up of the materials
 that stand the heat of battle?  I hope so,
 but time will tell.
 Most respectfully yours,
 CHAS. A. FRANCIS.
 Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 Senate Office Building,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I heard you on TV
 Sunday and I want you to know how whole-
 heartedly I agree with you on foreign policy
 and especially on the trouble in Vietnam.
 I was alarmed when I read in the New
 York  Times  this morning  that  President
 Johnson said in Minneapolis that the United
 States, "when necessary," would not hesi-
 tate to "risk war" to preserve the peace.
 In my opinion that would be no peace.
 Thank you for the wonderful work you
 are doing in the Senate.  I only wish there
 were many more like                                      you,  Senator HuM-
 PHREY and Senator FULBRIGHT, and others.
 Very sincerely yours,

 philosophy  of foreign policy even  though
 many of your colleagues will not publicly ap-
 prove of your comments and evaluations.                     I
 certainly agree with practically everything
 you mentioned on both programs.  I am not
 too sure that the United Nations is the com-
 plete solution, however, I feel it would be
 superior to the current U.S. unilateral mil-
 itary action in Vietnam and elsewhere, in-
 cluding the U.S. planes in Laos.
 It is comforting to know that we share the
 same opinions on the use of volunteers in
 McNamara's war, using SEATO allies in a
 peacekeeping role in Vietnam and the real-
 ization that the Vietnam puppets "we" set up
 are not"as effective as the Nhu family.  It
 was certainly a shame to see Madame Nhu's
 predictions about coups, etc., during her
 visit to the United States last year, become
 tragic realities several  months later.
 I am quite concerned about the outcome
 of the Far Eastern situation since I have very
 dear friends in the Philippines who occa-
 sionally travel in Thailand, Japan, etc. on
 U.N., Philippine Government and Philippine
 atomic energy matters.  However, I repeat
 that I feel the U.S. actions are wrong and
 illegal.

 Senator WAYNE MORSE: With General Tay-

 I would like to know why Americans are
 the only ones sent to Vietnam?
 Why are not other countries trying to
 help out over there?
 Generals want war to add to their glory,
 but the mothers, wives and sweethearts of
 the American men do not want war.
 Can you do something to stop the war-
 mongers from exploiting our men over there.
 We have lost too many men already.
 Thank you for your consideration,

 voted for its candidates, my family and I

 part in and have seen what happens in war,
 especially since the Second World War, and
 we believe in and support as we can the
 United Nations with all its operations as our
 best hope for the world.  We have never been
 able to understand why the United States
 has not tried the United Nations for the

 Is still a chance for President Johnson to
 change his course and try.  Surely, at this
 point, he is carrying us more slowly than
 the Republicans would, but nevertheless, into

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Among many other
 concerned Americans I am deeply grateful to
 you for your forthright questioning of our
 self-defeating   un-American   policies   in
 southeast Asia.  It is hard for me to under-
 stand how our Government can be so short-
 sighted as to believe that our prestige and
 influence in Asia can be increased by policies
 of a sort that were discredited even before
 World War II. and which--as you note-
 have been declared illegal under a variety
 of International agreements.
 Has it ever occurred to you that by desig-
 nating our regional alliances as specifically
 against "Communist"  aggression and  ex-
 pansion that we have unconsciously repro-
 duced the pre-World War II Axis                                                                    "anti-
 Comintern  Pact"?  The U.S. Government
 condemned this Axis Pact as designed to hide
 their own aggressive and expansionist aims.
 I very much fear that our own anti-Commu-
 nist pacts seem similarly aggressive and ex-
 pansionist to many governments which re-
 ject  communism for  their  own societies.
 During the formation of the SEATO, for ex-
 ample, the Asian governments deplored the
 U.S. emphasis on military force to "contain
 communism" and urged policies for economic
 development.
 I am venturing to enclose some letters to
 the Times I've written on this Issue.  Some
 have been published, some not.  Our Gov-
 ernment's distortions of the record are truly
 shocking.   Please keep pressing the issue.
 We, the American people, seem increasingly
 to be pushed into the role of robot-rather
 than the informed electorate on which our
 democracy rests.
 With appreciation.
 Sincerely,
 Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 Senior Senator of Oregon,
 Senate Building,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR: It was with great interest
 that I listened to your statements on today's
 "Issues and Answers."  I share your opinion
 concerning our actions in southeast Asia
 100 percent and I hope that enough people
 will have listened to you so that they snap
 out of their blind indifference and compla-
 cency to tolerate the brinkmanship of the
 Pentagon.
 I understand that the Senate has the right
 to vote for or against the appointment of an
 ambassador.   Why then don't you show
 through  your vote  that  you  disapprove
 strongly this newest move of appointing the
 Chief of Staff of our military forces to an
 ambassadorship, a move which throughout
 the world can have only one meaning?    I
 suppose that Senator FULBRXGHT has similiar
 views.
 If you two and some other reasonable men
 who like you, watch with deep concern our
 slithering into a new war, would take an
 energetic stand maybe it could stop Mr.
 Johnson to put his trust so completely in
 Mr. McNamara.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:  Thank you for your
 remarks on the television program, "Issues
 and Answers," today. While we believe in the
 APRIL 17, 1964.
 To the EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES:
 A Times' editorial (April 16), headed "Blood
 Sport" began: "A deranged youth steps out
 on an Albany hotel ledge.         Twelve stories
 below, crowds urge him to jump.  Not to a
 net's safety. To death. What kind of people
 can become such a mob?  How can adults
 yell 'chicken' and 'yellow' to another hu-
 man dangling on the lip of danger?"
 Yes.  But a more urgent question is how
 can some of our leading citizens cry chicken
 to our Government and urge it to carry out
 bombing attacks against North Vietnam?
 How  can  our  Government,  in  effect,  say
 yellow to the Vietnamese who want a U.S.-
 maintained  fratricidal slaughter stopped?
 Not long ago the Times published a wirephoto
 from South Vietnam showing a small child
 hideously burned by napalm supplied by the
 United States, and dropped from a U.S.-sup-
 plied plane, piloted by a young American.
 Many of our most respected citizens tell us
 we must continue such  activities or lose
 prestige.  Others calmly debate whether a
 bombing attack against North Vietnam would
 be good or bad as an election gimmick.
 The Times editorial concluded: "Disregard
 for another's life-by inertia or, worse, by
 goading-takes civilized people back to the
 cave.  Does the attitude of that Albany mob
 bespeak a way of life for many Americans?
 If so, the bell tolls for all of us."
 The Times says it better than I can, but
 it addresses its feeling of shock at the gnat.
 The lesser evil.  It is the camel, national pol-
 icy, that is truly frightening.  If disregard
 for human life is ugly for the man-in-the-
 street, it is infinitely uglier at the level of
 national policy.  Whether consciously or un-
 consciously our attitudes are influenced by
 those of our Nation's leaders. Our leaders
 have chosen the caveman's club, rather than
 the civilized men's tools of negotiation, ar-
 bitration,  conciliation.   In  Vietnam  our
 whole nation is the mob.  And the bell is
 tolling.
 JuNE 15, 1964.
 To the EDrroa of the NEW YORK TIMES:
 In his column of June 3, C.. L. Sulzberger
 declared that the SEATO alliance was no help
 in carrying out U.S. policy in Vietnam, and
 concluded that: "We must therefore face the
 problem of salvaging our Indochina crisis on
 the basis of what we consider right * * *.
 In southeast Asia we must honor our com-
 mitments and respect our interest."
 Most Americans would surely agree with
 Mr. Sulzberger that the U.S. Government
 should "honor our commitments."  The diffi-
 culty is that by now the U.S. Government has
 made so many directly conflicting commit-
 ments that it literally cannot be faithful to
 all of them.
 The United States is committed, under the
 U.N. Charter, not to use force save in the
 common interest.  No U.N. resolution has
 ever requested, or authorized, U.S. military
 aid in South Vietnam.
 The U.S. Government was further com-
 mitted by the Geneva Accord of 1964 not to
 send modern military equipment, not to send
 additional military advisers, and certainly
 not to send 16,000 "miscellaneous military,
 many of them to actual combat, disguised as
 "advisers."  Mr. Sulzberger actually quotes
 the late Secretary of State Dulles as telling
 him, in February 1955 that: "The Geneva
 * * * accord bars the importation into Indo-
 china of new military aid. The United States
 of America can't increase the number of its
 military advisers."
 The United States was, at least monfly,
 committed to accept the result of a nation-
 wide election to be held throughout Viet-
 nam in 1956.  The United States backed the
 decision of Ngo Dinh Diem not to held the
 election.
 The United States was committed to sup-
 port Diem as the "legally elected President of
 the Republic of Vietnam."  When Diem was
 was overthrown by a military coup-with at
 least  indirect  encouragement  from  the
 United States, the United States at once com-
 mitted itself to the new regime.                                                                                                                  When that
 regime was overthrown by another military
 coup the United States at once committed
 itself to it.
 Increasingly since late 1960, the U.S. Gov-
 ernment has committed itself to the war
 effort in South Vietnam.  Of all the com-
 mitments this appears to be the one the U.S.
 Government chooses to honor.
 Is a commitment to a war effort in Vietnam
 the sort of commitment Americans in gen-
 eral would choose to honor above prior com-
 mitments to seek solutions by negotiation,
 arbitration, mediation, and by techniques
 spelled out in the U.N. Charter.

 RUSK DISPUTED ON VIETNAM-GENEVA AccoRDs
 FORBID  INDEPENDENT  ENTITY                        IN  SOUTH,
 WRITER STATES
 To the EDITOR .OF THE l`lEw YORK TIMES:
 . In his press conference .(the Times, Nov. 9)
 Secretary of State Rusk, responding to a
 question about Vietnam, said: "The other
 side was fully committed-fully committed-
 in the original Geneva settlement of 1954
 to  the arrangements, which  provided for
 South Vietnam as an independent entity."
 This is a puzzling statement.  The record
 .seems to prove that not only did the Geneva
 agreements of 1954 not provide for South
 Vietnam as an. Independent entity, but ex-
 pressly forbade such a development.  Article
 6 of the final declaration says of Vieti;am
 that "the military demarcation line should
 not in any way be interpreted as constituting
 a political or territorial boundary * * ^:'
 The 17th parallel was chosen merely as a
 cease-fire line to, separate the opposing mili-
 tary forces.
 The agreements specifically provided that
 'Vietnam should be unified by nationwide
 elections in 1956.  These facts are acknowl-
 edged in a State Department pamphlet "A
 Threat to the Peace," published in December
 1961, which gives the U.S. official position
 about the. Vietnam problem at that time.
 The pamphlet explains why the Diem gov-
 ernment refused to carry out the agreement
 to hold the scheduled election, and why the
 U.S. Government backed Diem's position.
 The State Department wrote: "It was the
 Communists'  calculation  that , nationwide
 elections scheduled in the, accords for 1956
 would turn all of Vietnam over to them.
 It is profoundly disturbing to find our own
 Government rewriting history.  It is not easy
 to see how our Government can encourage
 adherence to international agreements by
 ignoring them.

 VIETNAM  WITHDRAWAL  URGED-EVENTS  BE-
 LIEVED To  INDICATE  NEITHER LEADERS                      NOR
 PEOPLE WANT OUR HELP
 To THE EDITOR. OF THE. NEW YORK TIMES:
 Reporting to  the  House  Armed Services
 Committee on January 27, Secretary of De-
 fense McNamara said:
 "In the case of South Vietnam our help
 1s clearly wanted, and we are deeply engaged
 in supporting the Vietnamese Government
 and people in their war against the Commu-
 nist Vietcong."
 Surely. Secretary McNamara meant to say
 "our help is clearly not wanted," for almost
 as he was speaking the Government which
 presumably wanted "our help" to keep fight-
 ing was overthrown by another military coup,
 and the fines reported this event in head-
 lines which read: "Vietnam Junta Ousted by
 Military ~}issidents Who Fear 'Neutralism,' "
 In other words, the generals whom our
 Government supported in their coup to re-
 place the Diem government which was be-
 ginning to "flirt with neutralism" began in
 turn to incline toward the same policy. If
 anything seems "clear" in this grim situation
 it Is that our Government is finding it in-
 creasingly difficult to find even military lead-
 ers who "clearly want our help" to continue
 their fratricidal strife.
 .As for the Vietnamese people, it has never
 been their war.  If reports in the Times (and
 :our  newsweeklies)  have  made  anything
 clear, it is that the Vietnamese people have
 'supported the war so little that a ,ruthless
 policy of forcing them into fortified villages
 'was introduced to prevent them from help-
 ing the guerrilla fighters.                    And the so-called
 Vietcong may, or may not be Communists,
 or pro-Communist, but they are unquestion-
 ably Vietnamese..
 ,ACK OF OUTCRY
 The situation in Vietnam is so unworthy
 of us that the apparent lack of popular out-
 cry against it suggests a condition of in-
 difference and moral callousness few of us
 would have believed possible only a few
 years ago.  It is this growing apathy and
 callousness that is the true enemy of the
 "values we hold dear."
 The U.S. Government should at once pre-
 sent the problem of Vietnam to the U.N. Se-
 curity  Council, and should withdraw our
 military advisers and stop providing millions
 of dollars a day to keep a war going.
 If our leadership means only destruction
 and death for the people who live in distant
 areas our commentators call "strategic real
 estate," our Nation will go down in history
 as  just  another  rampaging great  power,
 self-convinced that our might makes right.
 And it will not be the Communists who will
 have betrayed us.  It will have been our-
 selves.

 HONORABLE  SIR:  Our  association has  di-
 rected that we commend you on your firm
 and critical stand against the policies of our
 Government in Vietnam and southeast Asia.
 Our organization associates itself with you
 in the proposition (1) that the role of our
 Government played in the South Vietnamese
 situation  endangers  world peace  and  the
 whole of mankind itself; (2) should be im-
 mediately referred to the United Nations.
 Moreover, Sir, we think it strange that the
 Government of the United States can involve
 itself In police action for "freedom in South
 Vietnam" and cannot involve itself In Mis-
 sissippi and the Southern States with police
 action to preserve freedom, the Bill of Rights,
 and the right of every citizen to vote.  We
 are certain that Afro-Americans, people of
 African descent, colonial peoples everywhere
 look with grave misgivings on this strange
 contradiction.  We are certain that more
 and more democratic-minded people every-
 where will question the role of our Govern-
 ment and the American people as represent-
 ing a nation devoted to preserving freedom
 and democracy in the world.
 A copy of this letter in suport of your
 views is being forwarded to the President of
 the United States and to the Representatives
 in Congress.  We urge you to hold fast and
 endure to the end that our Nation and its
 people not become the perpetrators of a
 world thermonuclear war.

 DEAR SIR:  How Wonderful your stand on
 Vietnam-saw you on TV program "Today."
 I thoroughly concur with you and hope for
 15155
 more Americans to know the truth about
 this.
 NEW YORK CITY, N.Y.
 Thank God for Senators like you and
 the work you are doing toward stopping
 the horrible war in Vietnam.
 Mrs. EsTHER METLIZ.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: At a meeting of 100
 women held at Mapleton Park Synagogue,
 Brooklyn, on June 25, 1964, it was firmly
 stated that we agree wholeheartedly with
 your stand on Vietnam.  We should never
 have  gone  there.   We urge  your  further
 demonstration   of good will  to bring our
 boys home and negotiate a peace through
 the U.N.
 GLENDALE, CALIF., June 25, 1964.
 DEAR SENATOR:  You were great on Today
 NBC program subject of the President's pri-
 vate war in southeast Asia.  But many think
 the king can do wrong, another F.D.R. image
 and look where its got us?
 You should have been a Republican-yes-
 we shoot at  Communists over there and
 coddle them here at home. Speak at colleges,
 etc.
 Yours truly,
 JUNE 24, 1964.
 DEAR SENATOR: I agree with everything you
 said  about  our  policy  in  Asia,  on  the
 "Today" show.
 Glad to hear you express your opinion.
 We need more like you in the Government.
 Hope others who agree with you, will write
 you.  As I am sure you will hear from the
 GOLDWATER followers, and Pentagon friends.
 Keep talking.
 Very truly,
 Mrs. MILTON H. ROGERS.

 DEAR  SENATOR                                       WAYNE    MORSE: We  agree
 with you that President Johnson has no
 power to make or declare war in Vietnam
 but only Congress has.
 We heard you on the "Today" program,
 June 25, 1964, and thank you for telling us
 the best way to settle the Vietnam situation
 Is in the United Nations as I and most Amer-
 ican people I am sure agree.  We want peace
 and not men killed-that is what the United
 Nations is for.
 MARY and SOL HAMMERSTEIN.
 DEAR SENATOR WAYNE MORSE:  Thank you
 for expressing the truth on the "Today" pro-
 gram on TV channel 4, on June 25, 1964.
 It  is  indeed                              unconstitutional to  have  a
 President of United States make war or de-
 clare war instead of Congress.                                                                                                                                     We do not
 want war and have American boys killed in
 Vietnam. We want things settled peacefully
 in the United Nations.
 Thank you,
 Mr. and Mrs. ABE GOLDBERG.
 JUNE 26, 1964.
 DEAR SENATOR: We listened to your bril-
 liant speech on South Vietnam on "Today"
 TV.  It is refreshing to have a Democrat pick
 flaws in the present administration's policy
 with concrete knowledge of our Constitution.
 We don't want another Korea, or Bay of Pigs
 mistake.
 If we are at war let Congress declare it.
 Am proud that our 18-year-old son enlisted
 in World War II-as did his father in World
 War I-both after Congress declared war.
 We try to help other countries, yet are
 blind to our own small civil war.
 Respectfully,
 H. BRICE.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: It was good to hear
 your strong voice in opposition to the Viet-
 nam war.  I have been disturbed over it
 from the beginning and feel powerless to do
 anything about it.  I agree thoroughly with
 you.
 Sincerely,
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Keep up your vehe-
 ment protest against stepped-up, undeclared
 dirty war in Vietnam where American casu-
 alty list enlarges daily.
 Show up the wickedness of a statement
 from some underling in authority in Wash-
 ington that no protection assured to those
 brave young people helping to register in
 Mississippi, followed that day or next by
 total disappearance of three heroic young
 people.  Place Army where needed.

 DEAR     SENATOR:  Confucius      Said  the  first

 We are greatly encouraged by your bold-
 ness in calling a spade a spade and war-

 Please make a speech on TV and rally the

 the committee on the President's death and
 now sending Dulles to Mississippi.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Your "Today" ap-

 well.  I agree with all you said, sir.  And
 I urge you to continue saying it with the
 same clarity and reason and restraint and
 hard-hitting truth and patriotism that you
 showed in your "Today" appearance.
 Perhaps the policies in Asia are devices
 to last through election; but the danger is
 that they will get out of hand, or into the
 wrong hands-and we may not be able to
 stem the tide.  Even, without that, to play
 politics with the lives of men seems very
 wrong.  But it is probably no bluff-and
 we need your voice-and that of other good
 liberals or we may well lose the respect of
 the world.

 HONORABLE SIR: Heard you this morning

 in agreement with your convictions.  And
 the average U.S. citizen is also, I believe.
 The layman is discussing, and seriously, poli-

 of commonsense he has
 I am neither a Democrat or from Oregon,

 issue (Vietnam).
 Respectfully yours,
 Mrs. GRACE CLOER.
 DEAR SIR: I'm glad to hear your views on
 Vietnam on TV. I agree with you. I've lived
 in Japan for 2 years, the news there presents
 only the views of the ad13linistration, yet I've
 only talked to one person who believed we
 ought to be in Vietnam.  I would like to
 hear interviews of the common soldier, both
 for and against the war in Vietnam.  I've
 heard them, but never see them in print.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I heard that you will

 I asked Senator HART to send me the
 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD just so I can follow
 what you and your friends are saying about
 Laos and Vietnam.  I told him why, too.
 Yours respectfully,
 Mrs. MILDRED FRANKLIN.
 DEAR SIR: You are the only one with any
 sense in Washington.  I hope they put all
 the warmongers in the firing lines in Asia,
 as the rest of us people don't care who rules
 Asia.  We have enough to take care of our
 own troubles, and so has all other people
 of the world no matter who rules them, and
 for God's sake we would like to know the
 truth from the State and Defense Depart-
 ments for a change before we lose all the
 faith in our Government.
 Appreciate your outspokenness on stopping
 the terrible war in Vietnam. No more Ameri-

 face the misery, degradation, abuse, tor-

 were sent to fight battles for people who
 would not fight for themselves.  Yours may
 seem a lone voice, Senator MORSE, but the

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: The enclosed letter,

 have reason to believe that a number of
 Ann Arbor women share our uneasiness about
 the course our country seems to be taking in
 southeast Asia.
 Sincerely,
 EDITOR, THE NEWS:                               -
 Last Tuesday President Johnson said, "War
 is obsolete because there can be no winner."
 On the same day, Senator MORSE warned,
 "The United States is headed for war in Asia
 and will be hated for the next 500 years by
 the majority of mankind."           -
 Reading the news these past weeks has
 given us the uneasy feeling that we, along
 with the rest of the American public, were
 being carefully prepared for a new U.S. policy
 in southeast Asia.  The "new look" has been
 unfolded in a steady flow of announcements:
 redeployment of service personnel to more
 strategic bases; new military shipments (oh,
 just routine replacements of wornout equip-
 ment) ; then the sudden emergency-full-
 blown-of a jet air base just south of the
 .17th parallel in South Vietnam; and now
 the appointment of a military authority on
 guerrilla fighting 'as our Ambassador in Sai-
 gon, ' when a civilian with U.N. experience
 withdrew. We gather that the administra-

 mann has called the commitment a blunder.
 Now the United States Is "honoring" this
 commitment (1) by increasing itand (2) by
 violating other commitments.  Our country
 is publicly eonimited to leadership In the
 world's quest for peaceful solutions of com-
 plex problems.  Our new southeast Asia pol-
 icy violates this high commitment. Our new
 jet base in South' Vietnam clearly violates
 the Geneva agreement of 1954.
 It's easier to build a military base in a
 foreign country than to withdraw it once it's
 there.   Khrushchev withdrew his missiles
 from Cuba but we still have Guantaipamo
 and have sworn to hold on to it.  Now it
 seems    we've  established  a  little bit  of
 "American" territory in South Vietnam and
 will be asked to defend It to the death.   Ah,
 whose death?    Who and how many will die
 for that aircraft base in Vietnam, built with
 our tax dollars and without our knowledge?
 We appear to be proceeding in disregard
 of the honest reservations of our allies and
 of Senator MORSE'S "majority of mankind"
 to come.  In so doing, do we exhibit an un-
 seemly arrogance which closes doors we can
 Ill afford to close in a world where "war is
 obsolete?"

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Your conviction, ex-

 morning, that the whole question of Vietnam
 and the rest of southeast Asia should be
 taken to the United Nations for decision
 meets with my hearty approval.
 I, as only one individual, and a woman at
 that, have long felt that we were conduct-
 Ing a war illegally without the voted ap-
 proval of Congress.
 We cannot talk of peace out of one side
 of our mouths, and conduct an illegal war
 with justification, out of the other side.
 Like many others (I presume), I feel frus-
 trated, listening and reading day after day
 about all these many problems that face
 humans all over the world, and not being
 able to do anything about them.
 If there is any way that I can support you
 in your efforts to have the U.S. Govern-

 the U.N. for action, instead of the United
 States of America drifting into a unilateral
 war with Communist China, I'd be glad to do
 my bit.

 present V'.8, policy in Vietnam and Laos.  I
 have little understanding of our unilateral
 policy of form there for issues which seem
 political and not military ones. I too, coun-
 sel the President to use his policy of settling
 problems with words of reason rather than
 actions of force and destruction.
 Frankly, I am filled with fear that this
 little dirty war will be escalated to a big
 dirty war. I hope you will continue to speak
 out loud and often as you see this issue.
 If there is anything further you feel I
 can do, I shall be most happy to give It
 consideration.
 Sincerely yours,
 WASHINGTON, D.C.,

 Senator WAYNE MORSE.
 DEAR SENATOR: For several weeks I have
 been following your statements on Vietnam,
 and the President's handling of the war there,
 with great surprise.
 I really didn't think any Member of the
 Senate had the political courage that you
 show.  But in the long run I think you may
 find that the majority of the American
 people would support your view over the
 administration view on Vietnam if presented
 the Issues and allowed to choose.
 Certainly I agree with you completely and
 urge you to keep on.  You set an example
 for other Members of the Senate and, I hope,
 may keep us from some hideous consequence.
 Best wishes.

 DEAR SENATOR MoasE:  I watched the in-

 and I was gratified to see that there are
 still responsible people that are sane.
 I am a foreign student from Greece.  I
 am a bit at ease because I know that "your
 man from Washington" will have a landslide.
 I would be more than honored if I had the
 chance to shake your hand.  I am certain
 that if you will happen. to visit Chicago, I
 will not miss the opportunity to do so.

 President LYNDON B. JOHNSON,
 The White House,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR PRESIDENT JOHNSON: In your address
 In Minneapolis you renewed the pledge to
 protect the freedom of South Vietna{n and
 to use the force necessary to that end. How-
 ever, the applause of listeners was reserved
 for your pledge to continue your quest for
 peace.
 We do not believe that our foreign policy
 should be determined by a popularity poll
 but it is evident that there is no enthusiasm
 for escalating the civil war in South Viet-
 nam into an international conflict. We agree
 with your remarks praising the United Na-
 tions and so we ask, "Why that organization
 has not been used in the present conflict?"
 Is the present government any more than the
 Diem regime one of the peoples' own choice?
 We are not experts but it seems to make
 good sense to us to ask for a plebiscite of
 South  and  North  Vietnam  under  U.N.
 auspices and with all foreign troops, includ-
 ing our own, withdrawn.                                                                                                                 If we cannot win,
 we might achieve neutrality at least.
 Thiscourse should remove the implication
 that under the guise of "protection" we are
 helping to Impose an unwelcome govern-
 ment on the people of South Vietnam and
 taking sides in a civil war.  It should further
 your quest for peace, and still retain our
 honor.
 Sincerely yours,
 L. D. and ALICE MACINTYRE.

 DEAR    SENATOR MORSE:  After  listening to
 "Issues and Answers" I had to write to you
 to say that I am completely in accord with
 your views on the war In Vietnam.  I have
 been increasingly more disturbed about our
 policies in southeast Asia. I feel that we
 do have a responsibility to the world to
 advance democracy and freedom.  However,
 I also feel we have no right to make war.
 When we adopt Communist tactics we have
 already lost because our goal Is for people
 to  choose  freely.   Freedom  cannot and
 should not be advanced by U.S. force.
 Cuba is a glaring example of our setting
 up a dictator in the name of democracy
 and how it has ended is not what our leaders
 foresaw.
 Please keep up your plea to keep us fight-
 ing for peace and for a strong United Na-
 tions.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Please send me your

 say that I have lacked the courage to come
 right out and condemn the role our Govern-

 your forthrightness.
 Now I am really ready to speak out, and
 keep speaking out.  I don't care what my
 neighbors may think. One stands the chance
 of being called a traitor, and all the rest, but
 it. now seems abundantly clear to me that

 disgrace ourselves.

 Vietnam on the "Today" show, and you gave
 me heart. You said many things that badly
 need saying.  Please continue your fight.
 What you are saying is vastly important, but
 just as important is that someone is saying
 it.  We in this country, I maintain, are not
 inherently aggressive and impractical, but
 we   are unbelievably  ignorant,  especially
 where our relationship to and standing in

 DEAR SIR: Our membership at their regular
 meeting of May 20, 1964, voted to commend
 you and Senator GRUENING, of Alaska, for
 your courageous injection of truth and rea-
 son into the foreign policy debate.  We feel
 we are being sucked into a full-scale war in
 South Vietnam without all the facts being
 told the people.  We would like to know
 what the State Department calls a "consti-
 tutional government" when in South Viet-
 nam our soldiers are dying to protect what
 they call a constitutional government, while
 in Brazil an elected constitutional govern-
 ment was overthrown and these same people
 fell all over themselves to congratulate the
 "brass" there for their success in the over-
 throwing of the government there.
 Would you kindly send us a copy of your
 speeches on South Vietnam and on foreign
 policy?

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I am writing to you
 to tell you that I am wholeheartedly in agree-
 ment with your views on our Involvement in
 southeast Asia.  Though I am a college in-
 structor and a scientist, I have have an active
 interest in politics and world affairs.  I be-
 lieve that the United States should get off
 the southeast Asia mainland altogether-in-
 eluding both Laos and South Vietnam.  The
 State Department should realize that the
 United States cannot win a war on the main-
 land of Asia.  Is this President Johnson's
 Idea  of  prosperity-an  artificially created
 prosperity based on building war materials
 for a war in Asia?  If the President doesn't
 soon get us disentangled from that mess,
 he will not get my vote in November, even
 though I agree with his domestic policies
 otherwise.
 Keep up the good work.

 the experience of standing in the lonely

 fired a Vietnamese village * * * Publication
 of the AP photo resulted in the (U.S.) De-

 DEAR SENATOR: You seem to be one of the
 few humanitarians in Congress. That's the
 reason we are writing to you.  If we lived in
 Oregon our family of six voters would sup-
 port you in full.  The only request that we
 have to make is read June 12 issue, 1964, and
 see the pictures under the caption "But this
 is my duty," in Life magazine.
 Please tell Congress that at least
 area our people are sick and tired
 senseless war.
 Are we a nation of barbarians?
 Thank you, Senator and the best

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Just a lineto you to
 encourage you in your attacks on foreign aid
 to corrupt, unreforming governments and on
 our policy in Vietnam.
 I realize, as I'm sure you do, that such
 independent statements can be dangerous
 to you politically; it takes a strong and cou-
 rageous personality to point out the harsh
 facts to the administration and the American
 public as you have been doing so effectively
 in recent months.
 Best of luck to you, and I hope to keep
 hearing your strong, liberal voice  on the
 mayor issues confronting the United States
 today and in the future.

 DEAR   SENATOR   MORSE: I   agree   whole-
 heartedly with your views regarding our "out-
 law" activities in southeast Asia and par-
 ticularly in Vietnam.  I began to rethink our
 participation in these countries this past
 week when you expressed yourself following
 one committee meeting with the Secretary
 of Defense and General Taylor.

 I truly believe that a U.N. functioning

 DEAR SIR: I have just listened to your re-

 gram.                  I have spent considerable time in
 that area in the U.S. Navy and feel closer
 to the situation than the average citizen.
 Let me thank you for enlightening the

 I agree with you and hope you are successful
 in blocking our military entry into war in
 Asia.

 Senator MORSE,
 DEAR  SIR:  I saw and heard you on the
 "Today Show", and I believe you are 100
 percent right.  I have always admired you,
 you have more brains in your little toe, than
 those generals who sit safely in Washington.
 While the kids go and get killed, to satisfy
 who?  The generals of course.
 The United Nations was born to settle
 wars, I am for President Johnson too, but
 he is letting the wrong people advise him.
 I hope you convince these tinheads to
 change their minds.
 Sincerely,
 Mrs. R. DAVIS.

 DEAR  SENATOR  MORSE:        Please,   Senator
 MORSE, use whatever persuasion you can to
 stop the tide of aggressors in public office
 before we have another major war.
 We in Florida cannot turn to our own
 Representatives; they are not fair to our own
 citizens, how can they be otherwise toward
 other nations.
 Why is it so many people feel that they
 are entitled to tell other countries how to
 run their affairs. when our own is about the
 most immoral in every way.  Would any
 people be anxious to join our ways unless
 paid or coersioned?
 For a short time we had hopes in Governor
 Scranton till he came to Florida with the
 usual belligerent talk against Cuba.
 I can look till I'm cross eyed but see only
 that they should settle their affairs inside
 Cuba by their ? own people.  Will he spread
 communism to our neighboring countries?
 I think we are doing a better job of it by
 our example, by what is happening here in
 America and what we are doing to others.
 Sincerely,
 'Mrs. J.' STOWE.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I hope that I am
 correctly informed that you question present
 U.S. policies in Vietnam and favor our
 making an earnest effort to negotiate a
 settlement,
 To me it seems urgent that negotiations
 begin promptly before the fighting is ex-
 tended aancj that they include all the nations
 involved in southeast Asia.  Enclosed is a
 copy of a letter similar to one I have just sent
 to President Johnson.
 Will you please exert every effort to extri-
 cate us and the world from a struggle which
 has the effect of preventing completion of a
 revolution and which may readily get out of
 control?
 Sincerely yours,
 GELSTON MCNEIL.
 P.S.-This letter should have been modi-
 fied for you. I do thank you, Senator lyfoaSE,
 for your courageous and outspoken efforts in
 behalf of a more sane policy.
 For months I've been intending to thank
 you for a fine presentation of constructive
 ideas with regard to Cuba which I heard in
 an interview-type program on station WOMS.
 Keep up the good work.
 WASHINGTON, D.C.,
 June 24, 1964.
 President LYNDON B. JOHNSON,
 The White House,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR PRESIDENT JOHNSON:                      "The people of
 the world, I think, prefer reasoned agree-
 ment to ready attack."  Does not this state-
 ment of yours March 23, 1964)  call for a
 sharp  change in our course in southeast
 Asia? For not only is it true that people pre-
 fer reason to violence: it is also true that
 negotiation on the basis of equality holds the
 only hope for life in a nuclear age.
 Since 1945 war in South Vietnam has been
 killing and starving and maiming with ter-
 rible  suffering  thousands  of  women  and
 children as well as guerrilla fighters (who
 are also human).   None seems to know or
 care just how many.  At a meeting last week
 I  heard  a  Government  spokesman, while
 rightly lamenting the over 1,000 American
 casualties, speak with gusto of "wiping out
 the guerrillas."
 We should be demonstrating that we are
 friends of the world's poor by aiding their
 "revolution of rising expectations" in Viet-
 nam  and everywhere.  There  can be  no
 stability  until  this  revolution is accom-
 plished.
 Instead,  by supporting military juntas
 and other corrupt, oppressive governments,
 by supplying napalm and helicopters and
 barbed wire and cropdestroyers and other
 accouterments of modern war, we are op-
 posing the revolution.  Whether or not we
 intend to do so makes little difference.  We
 appear to the oppressed, underdeveloped,
 war-sick people to be just another white,
 colonial power replacing the French who, we
 ourselves admit, were denying the people
 their sacred right to life, liberty, and the
 pursuit of happiness.
 I agree with Walter Lippmann (New York
 Tribune, May 28) and with Senator MORSE
 that American troops never should have gone
 into Vietnam.  These men point out that we
 must correct our error by substituting nego-
 tiation for force.                                                                         In these Senators CHURCH,
 GRUENING, BEALL, and others agree-as do I.
 Stepping up the war in Vietnam would
 not only increase and prolong sufferings of
 the Vietnamese people and delay the revolu-
 tion, it would drive Ho Chi Minh completely
 into the arms of China (even as our starva-
 tion policies toward Cuba have driven Castro
 into dependence upon the great Communist
 powers).  Extending the war -will also cause
 U.S.S.R. to support China and thus destroy
 what improvement in relationships has been
 painstakingly and precariously worked out
 between the Soviet Union and the United
 States.
 Mr. Johnson, instead of aggravating ani-
 mosity between China and the United States
 of America, is it not time that we develop
 toward that great country a creative ap-
 proach which offers some possibility of peace-
 ful solution of problems and resumption of
 our traditional friendship?  Would it not
 be wise to consider President de Gaulle's
 15161
 proposals?  On the other hand, continuing
 our arrogant and self-righteous policies to-
 ward  China tends  to  lose us  friends,                                                   to
 solidify our enemies and thereby to lessen
 the possibility of rapprochement.
 A year ago at AmericanUniversity Presi-
 dent Kennedy pointed to the truth that con-
 ditions and attitudes in all kinds of societies
 change and that we must recognize and en-
 courage changes in others and be open to
 change  ourselves.  It  is  also  imperative,
 though extremely difficult for a nation-as
 for an individual-to admit its mistakes and
 change its  course.  Failure to do so will
 leave our country behind the march of his-
 tory at best, and, at worst, can make our
 beloved country an instrument for the de-
 struction of civilization.

 DEAR SENATOR: Thanks to you, for the words
 spoken over TV, when you said that our boys
 should not be dying in South Vietnam.  I
 think its so shameful for the- United States
 to have our boys there, when there has been
 no war declared.  Why don't our so-called
 allies go in there too.  They know its wrong.
 Here we have Cuba, right at our door, and
 no attention is given to what goes on there.
 But they risk their necks million miles away.
 We cannot police the entire world.  What
 would we say, when other countries sent
 military  force  over here to change our
 method?
 I am for a peaceful country.  The same
 should be followed with integration.  We
 can't do anything by force.  But people will
 understand each other as time goes on. We
 have no trouble here with a racial problem.
 All get along together and that goodwill, will
 spread if they would keep agitators out.
 Thanks again to you.  Will you appear on
 TV more often?
 We need a House full. of Members like you
 in Washington.
 Yours very sincerely,
 Mrs. RAYMOND MITCHELL.
 P.S.-The feed grain program should be
 scrapped.  It does more harm than good.
 The voluntary soil bank did so much more
 and cost less when people take their entire
 farm out of production.  This feed grain
 the  big farmers take' out the less fertile
 ground and draw Government pay and use
 that money to buy fertilizer and livestock
 to produce more on remaining acres, and
 therefore the surplus gets greater.

 DEAR Sea: I heard your talk on "Today"
 TV  today  concerning  the  action  of  the
 United States, directed by President John-
 son, in southeast Asia.
 I agree in detail with all you said in your
 TV interview.
 Too much of our actions are based on
 wishful thinking and self-deception--based
 mostly on an  infantile miselanic complex
 that we have that we are the chosen people
 to lead the rest of the world into the land of
 milk and honey--while we are disintegrating
 here at` home. We cannot understand that
 the rest of the world and no part of it see
 us as we see ourselves looking through our
 Alice in Wonderland lookingglass of wishful
 thinking, self-deception, and messianic com-
 plex.
 JUNE 24, 1964.
 DEAR SENATOR: I have been watching this
 Asiastic situation and try and take a fair
 approach to our position there and what we
 should do about it.  I have come to the deff-
 nite conclusion that you have the right
 answer. We do not want to get mixed up in
 it hot war with China, and it looks right
 now as though we are headed in that direc-
 tion.  The French fought in that area for
 over 7 years with top-flight troops, coupled
 with material aid from us, and they were
 decisively beaten.  Are we about to travel
 the same road?  Such a stupid course would
 deplete our resources and manpower almost
 to it point of no return.  It will be another
 Korea.  It seems that the Democratic Party
 (I am independent) is as frequently labeled,
 "the war party."
 Your position is, and will receive the sup-
 port of the right thinking citizen.  Keep up
 the good work.
 Respectfully yours,

 of ours, and who do you think President
 Johnson thinks he is, God?  13o you under-
 stand how small and helpless a person like
 myself feels in the face of what is going
 on in Washington.  I don't want my two
 clean young boys fighting in that stinking
 hole for a ridiculous cause-besides, accord-
 ing to those brainy intellectuals in govern-
 ment now, it isn't the fashion to "win" a
 war anymore.  If we had permitted General
 MacArthur to go on In Korea, this war may
 not have been necessary.  I am one of those
 Americans who believeeverything he wrote.
 And, according to many of my friends, they
 believe also, only most of them are too apa-
 thetic to write.
 I compliment you on your honest criticism
 of President Johnson.  All this makes me

 Just why a military department of our Gov-

 session of infallible wisdom in the area of
 peaceful international relations is beyond my
 understanding.  With specific reference  to
 this Nation's unilateral action in southeast
 Asia-which bids fair to represent the worst
 bungling by this country in international re-
 lationships for all time-I consider it to be
 absolutely shameful, utterly appalling, and
 entirely inconsistent with the policies of a
 nation  presumably  working  toward  world
 peace.  Apart from our participation In the
 matter as a part of a duly appointed United
 Nations force sent to restore peace, the
 United States has no military business in the
 area.

 It is a pleasure to you talk as a true

 agree with you that this is a McNamara war
 and that we should not send a military man
 as our Ambassador into that area (Taylor).
 Having had four brothers in the First
 World War, while I was trained as a nurse,
 and then three nephews in the Second World
 War on the German side, and three nephews
 here on the American side, I know what
 families are sacrificing. I lived in Germany
 during the first war and as an American

 DEAR SIR: I salute you on your courageous
 stand on American Involvement in Southeast
 Asia. We cannot correct the mistakes of 19th
 century imperialism by sacrificing American
 lives.  Nor can we hope to persuade the
 Asians-in the throes of a colonial revolution
 captured by the Communists-that we are
 any different from their former white masters
 and that our brand of freedom will be any
 better than what they have hitherto known
 at the hands of the whites; that is to say,
 exploitation and humiliation.
 I wholeheartedly support your position
 that our only recourse is the United Nations.
 Only if we direct our efforts through the
 United Nations can we avoid the onus of
 being considered the aggressor out there by
 the Asiatics and the other noncommitted
 peoples of the world.  To do otherwise is to

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Thank you.  Thank
 you.   Thank you for your fine, brave state-
 ments on South Vietnam.  It takes great
 courage to speak out against the foreign pol-
 icy as you and others have done. I wish that
 the American newspapers would publish your
 statements found in the CONGRESSIONAL REC-
 ORD, for surely the Angrican public is just
 uninformed about the true conditions- in
 southeast Asia.
 I consider you one of the finest patriots,
 because you are not afraid to speak out when
 you see we are not living up to our demo-
 cratic ideals (and the freedom to voice opin-
 ions is a hallmark of our democracy but
 which should not be censored by the press).
 We must try to educate the public to see
 that the proper place to solve international
 crises is in the United Nations.
 Wish you would run for President.

 MY  DEAR  SENATOR:  Your  forthright re-
 marks heard a few days ago on the NBC
 "Today"  show  certainly pointed up  the
 issues-and dangers-in the Vietnam situa-
 tion.
 As you so rightly said, the appointment of
 General Taylor to the vacated Lodge post
 does not augur well for a peaceful settle-
 ment of the situation.  The deep involve-
 ment of this country in the south Asia area
 and the "policing" action we have under-
 taken seems very paradoxical in view of our
 own inability to control our citizens in Mis-
 sissippi and Florida.
 It would seem sort of litre people in glass
 houses throwing stones-or don't do as I do,
 do as I say.
 Please Senator, keep speaking out against
 further action that commits thousands of
 American youth to lose their lives to sup-
 port regimes that are wholly unpopular with
 the citizens of the country.
 Cordially yours,
 EDWARD B. SALINGER.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I would like to com-
 mend you for your courageous and intelli-
 gent position and stand against the present
 reckless U.S. Involvement in Vietnam and
 Laos which, if allowed to pursue its present
 course, will surely lead to full-scale war and
 hatred of the whole world against us.
 I have just written to President Johnson to
 tell him that I, fully concur with your posi-
 tion. in regard to our foreign policy in Viet-
 nam and Laos.
 It's pathetic that Congress has so few men
 of your caliber and stature.  You will be re-
 membered in_ history by your compassion
 and unusual degree of intelligence.
 Wishing you continued success in
 efforts to achieve peace for mankind.
 Sincerely yours,

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Your ready sugges-
 tions for the Vietnam situation show, as al-
 ways, the long, deep thought that has gone
 before.  Your interview on the program "To-
 day," this morning, brought me the only
 comfort I have had on that situation,
 I, like you, am voting and working for
 President Johnson this fall.  I admire him
 very much.  I feel that now at this very
 moment is the time that he could well adopt
 your plan and map out a program for our
 beloved country which would save the United
 Nations and finally solve, our problem in
 Asia.  That might take years, but we would
 be on the right track.
 For years  I have been. your respectful
 admirer.

 The Honorable WAYNE MORSE,
 U.S. Senate,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:  I wish to let you
 know of my wholehearted support for your
 critical stand on the situation in Vietnam.
 Several weeks ago I heard you speak about
 this on the radio and was impressed by your
 ideas.  Up until this time, I had no notion
 that anyone in Congress was at all opposed
 to our provocative and shortsighted policy
 in the Far East.
 It is my understanding that the general
 goal of American foreign policy should be
 that of insuring the world peace and at the
 same time striving for the collapse of world
 communism.  At times our efforts toward
 both these goals go hand in hand, but some-
 times they do not.  Since the advent of the
 nuclear age, the possibility of a military
 solution is considered out of the question
 by any thinking person.  If so, then it seems
 the most promising opportunity for victory
 would consist of swinging the uncommitted
 peoples of the world over to our side.  If we
 could do this, then we would have innumer-
 able advantages over the Communists, e.g.,
 economically, tradewise, and not the least,
 the sheer number of people who would be
 alined with us.
 . These uncommitted multitudes in Asia and
 Africa are just beginning to throw off the
 shackles of colonialism, ignorance, and the
 effects of racial and economic exploitation.
 Communism,  as  taught in Moscow  and
 Peking, lures them economically from one
 side.  Democracy, and all of the advantages
 which go with personal freedom, should have
 at least equal appeal.  But does it really?
 To use the Madison Avenue phrase, just
 what is our "image" in the eyes of the world.
 I wonder what sort of glowing impression our
 Government makes by support of a military

 dictatorship which Is primarily engaged in
 the business of killing peasants.  Does this
 really add to the stature of the world's num-
 ber one power? I fear that to the many little
 people of the world this must take on the
 features of a David and Goliath struggle.
 This feeds beautifully into the Communist
 propaganda line that we are aggressive war-
 mongers.  By point of fact, in Vietnam we
 are doing just that.
 History teaches, and teaches bitterly, that
 revolutionary activity cannot be effectively
 put down unless the Government's effort has
 the strong support of the people behind it.
 Military rulers and petty dictators of all sorts
 lack this popular support since by definition
 their rule is self-imposed and maintained by
 repression of the opposition.  Often this is
 bulwarked by American dollars.
 Now let us take stock of some of our sup-
 posed "allies" and "comrades In arms" in the
 struggle against world communism. Of what
 possible benefit is it to the American people
 to  be  associated  with  creatures  such  as
 Chiang Kai-Shek, Franco, Madame Nu, or
 the present military junto in Saigon, to name
 but a few.  In time of peace, we absorb all
 of the rotten aspects of their reputations by
 the simple fact that we support and condone
 them. In time of war, does anyone honestly
 think that any of these small-time Hitters
 will stand gallantly by our side.  More likely
 than not they will flee the country with the
 gold we have given them as many others
 have before.
 This letter is already much too long.  But
 again r would say that your position in this
 vital issue is important, even if It is not
 popular at the moment.  Neither are many
 other positions popular where real courage
 is required.  Too often, basic political and
 philosophical change must be made by in-
 dividuals like yourself who stand for a time
 alone in opposition to the compact majority.

 DEAR SENATOR WAYNE MORSE: We see you
 on TV.  You are right about going to war
 with Red China.
 It should be taken to the United Nations.
 We don't want war; it should be solved in
 some peaceful way.  We don't want our sons
 to die for such a fool cause.  If they go to
 war with Red China it will make us weak
 and then Russia will step in.  I think we
 should keep our nose out of foreign affairs.
 Let the United Nations do the job.

 DEAR  SENATOR  MoRSE: We want you to
 know how we admired you for your out-
 spoken comments on the "Today" program
 this morning.
 You have given us a small feeling of secur-
 ity, but what has us baffled Is that more
 men, supposed to be the leaders of our coun-
 try, just follow along.
 Frankly we are very concerned about our
 Nation and its future-the TV and maga-
 zines and press distort the facts of what is
 really happening and the average person in
 our country today will not dig in and try
 to find the truth.  They would prefer to
 watch a murder mystery or hillbilly pro-
 gram on TV.
 As an individual there seems to be so little
 we cart do-so many of our young people
 have been completely brainwashed.
 Our America is not what It once was, or
 what it should be.  Everyone is out for his
 own gain and what he can get for himself
 with the least amount of effort.
 One of the main troubles In out world to-
 day stems from greed.
 We both had the feeling that the pro-
 gram panel was somewhat awestruck by
 your comments, and we seriously doubt
 that had they known, you perhaps would
 never have been asked to appear.  These are
 the things they are trying to hide from the
 people.
 Please keep the courage of your con-
 victions as we need more men in Washing-
 ton, like yourself, to fight these battles.

 DEAR  SENATOR  MoRsE: I want to thank
 you for the position you have taken against
 the continued and increasing undeclared
 war in Indochina.  It is a small comfort
 that we have at least one > enator with some
 decency left.
 I suppose  the theory is  that village-
 burning and the rest of it was legalized long
 ago by the British and such modern im-
 provements as we may add are only natural,
 the people being "natives" who put no
 value on human life.  Besides, they haven't
 any aircraft and we have a deal with the
 Russians.
 Admiral Felt  announced  this  weekend
 that we are going to risk war with China,
 but that China would be afraid to risk war
 with us, since they know we are too strong.
 This sounds like the thinking of Douglas
 MacArthur, who ended up wanting to use
 cobalt bombs.
 Presumably  Felt's  statement  is policy,
 since he is commander in chief.  And pre-
 sumably this is the policy of the President,
 the State Department, and the Government.
 All I know is, we never voted for it.  What
 seems to be the case is that the war-happy
 generals and the CIA invasionmakers are
 running the show and this business       of
 democracy and an election is nonsense and
 just for the papers.
 It seems hopeless to try to do something
 about it since It is not subject to vote or
 to control by elected representatives.  The
 whole thing proceeds as though GOLDWATER
 bad won-and he's not even nominated yet.
 Sincerely,
 JOHN V. MANNING.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Not being a constit-
 uent of yours I write as an American citizen
 to say that I fully agree with your position
 stated on the TV "Today" program this date
 that our President does not have the consti-
 tutional right to prosecute war in South
 Vietnam.
 However, you also said that you were going
 to the Democratic convention and support
 the President and do all you could to insure
 his reelection.
 This is the second time recently that I
 have heard a U.S. Senator seriously disagree
 with and oppose the President on an issue of
 tremendous importance-this time you say
 real war could result-and then heard the
 Senator announce that he will help reelect
 the erring one.  The logic of such a course
 escapes the ordinary person, and I should
 like to ask how we in a democracy can hope
 to secure the good government and peace we
 so earnestly desire if we continue to vote
 for, support, and reelect those whom we say
 oppose such?  I hope the answer Is not the
 old worn out one that all the other prospec-
 tive candidates, both Democratic and Re-
 publicans, would do worse things.
 With assurance of my esteem, I am,
 Very respectfully,
 N. W. BOWDEN.
 P.S.-The above inquiry from one born
 and reared a Democrat will probably seem to
 ignore party loyalty when the issue tran-

 We hope you will continue to find it possible
 to talk sense even when this touches on the

 DEAR SENATOR WAYNE MORSE: I agree with
 you every time you open your mouth.  On
 the situation in Vietnam you make sense.
 The  ominous  appointment  of   General
 Taylor to  ambassadorship                                                         is extremely
 alarming.  I  have  written                                                      the President,
 also.
 You are, I know, a man of stature among
 men of a ludicrous political specie.
 We cannot afford the luxury of playing
 this war game, lest the world be launched in
 a third world war, directed (I might add)
 at the North American Continent, as well as
 engulfing the entire world.
 Please, take continued courage to speak
 out in the Halls of Government for what is
 politically and morally right.  My husband
 also agrees with you.
 I know you have had many well-wishers.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:  Please let me con-

 rageous stand with regard to Vietnam.  I am
 wholeheartedly in agreement with you, and
 I am sure that many, many, who, like you,
 are in possession of the facts, know that you
 speak the truth but lack your courage, and
 would endanger America and the future of
 the world rather than risk political careers.
 I should think that even those who do not
 agree with you would have great admira-
 tion for your integrity.   The tragic truth
 is that history, I am sure, will prove you
 were right,  but, I am afraid, too late to
 save us.

 DEAR MR. MORSE: Just heard you on the
 "Today" program, and you are the first one I
 have listened to that has made any sense.  I
 have .always thought that the Congress made
 the decision it we were to have war, but
 President Johnson seems to be the one to
 decide.  Like you I don't think Red China
 can be bluffed with our threats, and just
 might fool us, if we think they will back
 down.
 They have 700 million people as you say
 they don't care about human life and they
 could send waves and waves of men against
 us.  Khrushchev would love us to have war
 with them that would save their men and
 fighting with them, and in the meantime
 when we were fighting China they would
 start something in Berlin, and also in Cuba.
 You're right we are the only ones in South
 Vietnam where are our Allies?
 They are smart they are staying out.  Will
 you please go on Meet the Press and tell the
 people about this mess we got ourselves in.
 Fighting thousands of miles away, and for-
 getting all about Cuba right at our door-
 steps.
 Mr. MORSE I have always voted Democratic
 but at-this time I feel like thousands more
 people not to vote for anyone.  If, you were
 running for President I would vote for you
 as you are the only one I ever heard that
 thought the same as I do.
 We are at war in Vietnam, as sure as the
 sun will rise tomorrow, and sending an Army
 man to take Lodge's place does not look good
 to me.  What good does it do to have a
 United Nations if the problems can't be
 brought to them to settle, I have also won-
 dered what they are doing all along about
 this crisis in South Vietnam?  Can one man,
 the President, make this decision to have our
 boys killed as they are every day over there
 (he has two girls) and talk so brave we will
 fight to the finish.
 As you said we cannot police Asia, maybe
 Russia  (Khrushchev)  is pretending to be
 angry at China and provoke a war with us
 then go in with China.  Its easy to start a
 war, but to stop it and get out of it is
 another thing.  Our Allies as you say are
 sitting on the sidelines, and saying what
 fools.
 De Gaulle sees the folly of us doing what
 we are doing, and he is not going along
 with us in our decisions to make a fool of
 ourselves.  That   "Washington   Pipeline"

 a Japanese intellectual of Tokyo who has

 "My friend, there is one thing I fear more
 than anything else.  It is that the United
 States may carry the Vietnam war into the
 North.  There is absolutely no question but
 that the Chinese would then enter the war
 against the Americans.  They are desperate-
 ly afraid of America.  Chinese on all levels
 see it as the aggressive and  expansionist
 center of world imperialist reaction. They
 would enter the Vietnamese war as a matter
 of national survival. This is as certain as
 that we sit here."

 DEAR SENATOR: I listened                                  to your broad-
 cast this morning on the "Today" TV pro-
 gram, and I am writing as an American
 citizen In support of your position that war
 is not the solution to the problems that face
 our government in southeast Asia.
 My wife and I have spent our lives as
 Baptist educational missionaries in China
 and of late years in Japan. Our purpose has
 been to teach the Christian way of life to
 students and to the people.
 We have often found ourselves unable to
 support our commercial and industrial in-
 terests of the United States who have too
 often looked upon the Chinese labor and
 resources as an opportunity to make money
 by use of cheap labor and cheap raw ma-
 terials.  This system also made a small num-
 ber Chinese of the compradore class rich,
 while the lot of the farmer, the intellectuals,
 and the craftsmen became worse and worse.
 The occupation of China by the U.S. Armed
 Forces during 1945-48 did nothing to help
 the common Chinese, indeed their lot be-
 came worse.
 Since 1948 the great western powers have
 given up their colonial policy so-called ex-
 cept the United States who are now engaged
 in a war with Vietnam to prevent the people
 of Vietnam from having political and eco-
 nomic control of southeast Asia.

 The hour is very late maybe too late to
 avoid a great war in the Pacific, but I know
 you will do your best to get the issues before

 a war which we cannot win and for which
 we have no heart.
 Those in the highest offices have lied to us
 until we have no confidence n what we are
 told-the latest, denial of the resignation of
 Lodge when we know, now, he had resigned
 when the denial was made.  The replace-
 ments weren't decided overnight.
 The administration making a fool of itself
 to its countrymen and the whole world-
 Johnson expecting plaudits for trying to
 "settle the crisis in Cyprus" while preparing
 for a real war in Asia.  Stating that Russia
 "agrees" to stay out of a war with Red China,
 expecting it to break a pact with Red China,
 but not to break that agreement.
 Why have  GOLDWATER and Wallace gone
 over so dramatically?    The people see what
 is taking place and will vote for anyone who
 will promise to reverse the present trend.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Yesterday I saw and
 heard you on the "Today" program of NBC.
 What you said is important, not only for
 the United States but for the whole world
 and I hope you will continue your fight to
 have this brought to the U.N.
 If we fought a war in southeast Asia, the
 problems  there  would  still  be  unsolved,
 just as they are in Korea.  These problems
 are compounded, rather than reduced by
 war.
 Also, I hope you can help to see that the
 laws of the United States apply also to the
 Slate of Mississippi.  Our son Douglas is
 among the young voter registration educa-
 tors there.  The rights of citizenship must
 be extended to all Americans.

 DEAR SENATOR: Although I have written
 you before, sir, my admiration and gratitude
 for and to you are of such dimension that I
 must let you know again.
 I'm grateful to providence that we have
 men of your caliber.  You are my favorite
 Senator and have been for many years; may
 God bless you, sir.
 My view runs parallel with yours, sir, from
 alpha to omega.
 Knowing that God is just, I often tremble
 over my country's behavior;  but I know
 that you intrepidly endeavor to retard the
 trigger-happy ones.  Again Senator MORSE,
 "It may make a difference to all eternity
 whether we do right or wrong today."
 May I also ask you, sir, to convey my
 gratitude to your fellow Senators HUMPHREY,

 DEAR  SENATOR:  I certainly want to con-
 gratulate you on your stand regarding the
 expansion of our military activities in south-
 east Asia.                                                                     I can't see where the administra-
 tion is trying to save anything but face; and
 believe me I don't think the administrative
 face that they will save, is worth the live@
 of our boys who already have been killed
 there. Much  less  the  lives  of  the many
 thousands more who will be killed with an
 expanded war.
 I further think, that it's too expensive a
 lesson in lives for our military to obtain
 practical experience in this manner.  I was
 under the impression that the Congress had
 the power to declare war.  Are you, worthy
 gentlemen, of these two legislative bodies
 going to surrender this responsibility to the
 administration?
 It seems to me that too many legislative
 prerogatives are being surrendered to the
 administrative branch.
 I'm sending a copy of this letter to Senators
 McNAMARA and HART of Michigan, and Con-
 gressman BROOMFIELD from my district.
 Yours very respectfully,

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I've just heard you
 on the "Today" show.
 You have given me hope, as you undoubt-
 edly have millions of others who heard you
 express  your  views  so  daringly  and  so
 clearly-that   someone  in  Washington   is
 aware of what is going on and even though it,
 is going against the actions of leaders in his
 own party, has the courage to ask what the
 majority of your countrymen are asking-
 Why are we acting alone?                    Why are we by-
 passing the United Nations?  Why are we
 sending our soldiers to die in the Far East?
 We are rebelling against what those in
 high office are doing to our country-the
 Supreme Court making our laws and scrap-
 ping the Constitution.  Taking away the
 rights of the majority and catering to a
 minority resulting in chaos. Getting us into
 there; and we are destined to the same ex-
 perience in southeast Asia, if we stay there.
 You will notice that our European allies,
 with 100 years experience in Far Eastern
 matters, are offering little help.
 I fully appreciate that the executive de-
 partment has the responsibility of foreign
 policy but the legislation department are
 the ones that vote the money and can con-
 trol the situation.
 Very respectfully yours,
 J. M. ROBINSON.

 I stood concerning South Vietnam, I now
 find myself compelled to urge you to continue
 your lonely battle against the U.S. Senate.
 The American public is being pushed into
 a war which could feasibly ruin the United
 States, the United Nations, and the world-
 and they will have no conception of why
 we will be fighting.
 Any assistance I, as a citizen of the United

 your fight, I will gladly do.

 day.                                                             I certainly solicit your activity in sup-
 port of his attitude.
 it seems to me that thinking men, who
 remember Korea, and the thousands upon
 thousands of American men and women who
 lost their lives or were otherwise maimed
 or severly crippled, do everything possible
 to avoid another conflict.
 Not only did we not win thewar in Korea,
 but we are continuing to lose the peace

 DEAR SIR:I would be lax as an interested
 American and as one of your most ardent
 admirers and supporters, if I did not express
 my views on your appearance on "Today" this
 date.
 It is a regrettable fact, but a few of us
 know that the policy being pursued today, is
 still Dulles brinkmanship,, and only a new
 administrator, and It is far more regrettable
 that you, one of the best qualified supporters
 of a better America and world, has to get on
 your high horse and take out after the one
 leader who too stands for in most part the
 things you stand for, as you and I know this
 is the very thing the GOP, who cannot think
 of anything good or constructive to propose,
 so they spend their time trying to pick up a
 scrap of any difference within the Democratic
 ranks and exploit it using the press, and
 TV which they in 98 percent control.
 I want to compliment you and your honest
 and forthright "Morse Manner" disagreeing,
 caused  by honest  differences  of opinion;
 which I feel is too right for comfort, as I
 clearly understand you and from listening to
 you back on radio, as Republican, then In-
 dependent, and as Democrat, also in our con-
 vention, as I work as a representative of the
 International Association of Machinists AFL-
 CIO and am away from home trying to assist
 those who struggle to make ends meet to
 feed, house, educate, and clothe their fami-
 lies.
 You know and I too know that this ap-
 pearance had great impact on millions who
 will not write, and so the GOP syndicated
 columnists who decry everything will use
 this expression for their own selfish and for
 most part stupid partisan purposes to try and
 gain political jobs, for those who would make
 fast GOP war.

 rather than typist, using the hunt and peck

 HONORABLE SIR: I want to complement you
 on your views, expressed on the "Today" show
 concerning our foreign policy in southeast
 Asia.
 I am the average American; voiceless, and
 concerned  about  the  "American  image"
 throughout the world.  We have enough
 sense to know something is rotten in Den-
 mark, judging by the gaseous bubbles ema-
 nating from the cesspool, but confused by
 the doubletalk.  We don't know what it is.
 You strangthened out the string for us this
 morning.  Let's call a spade a spade, and
 proceed to dig with it.  America deserves
 better representation than some of our people
 are offering.
 More power to people who think and speak
 as you do.  I am a working man, 70 years
 old, have been a Democrat all my life.  I
 don't have to worry about eating any more,

 alleged  war  for                                      self-determination  once
 seemed ridiculous and now seems disgust-
 ing.                                                                       Clearly the people of Vietnam, north
 and south, are quite determined that their
 future shall not be dictated to them by the
 United  States. I                                                   don't . know  what the
 Bhuddists in Saigon want, or what Ho Chi
 Minh wants, or what the prisoners in those
 "free" and fortified hamlets want, nor do I
 think they are sure of their aims either, but
 I am pretty damn sure that they do not
 want more U.S. generals, advisors, planes,
 guns, murder, and mayhem.
 Please push for U.N. guaranteed neutrality,
 U.N. border patrols and inspectors, etc., for
 the whole of southeast Asia. A neutral buffer
 belt around China seems to be our best hope.
 Why don't you and Senators  GRUENING,
 MANSFIELD and any other rational or semi-
 rational Senators put together a policy state-
 ment, get signatures from both Houses, pub-
 licize it, embarrass people  (L.B.J., Taylor,
 Lodge, et al.) with it.
 See if you can't hold up Senate approval
 of Maxwell's appointment.   Will there be
 hearings  first?  Then  grill him  on  his
 "unique" qualifications for the ambassa-
 dorial job.
 What can be done to curtail L.B.J.'s power
 in this area?  How best to expose the hypoc-
 risy of our southeast Asia policy?

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Some "unthinkable
 thoughts" which should be publicized.
 We (the United States) refused to sign the
 1954 Geneva Conference Agreement on Far
 Eastern  Affairs  which  stipulated  that  a
 plebiscite be held in North and South Viet-
 nam in 1956.
 We instead strengthened our ties with Ngo
 Dinh Diem (later recognized as a fraud and
 murdered).
 We sent a general in civilian clothes to
 assist the Diem regime "as an adviser."
 We sent more than 16,000 armed men
 without the necessary approval of Congress
 to carry on a war.
 We now call it a war and decorate casual-
 ties accordingly.
 We now send another general, presumably
 in civilian clothes, as Ambassador to South
 Vietnam.
 We now threaten to attack North Vietnam
 from South Vietnam and the South China
 Sea and Laos from Thailand.
 We call the rebels of South Vietnam and
 Laos Vietcong or Communists, not "Washing-
 ton rebels."
 Congress has not declared war and the
 mass of people of the United States do not
 want war.
 Who is running this country?  Is it Mc-
 Namara who represents the capitalistic in-
 terests?
 The voices of Senators MORSE, FULRRIGHT,
 and GRUENING must be louder and persist-
 ently echoed throughout the land.  Let no

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: We were downright
 relieved to hear the ideas you expressed on
 the "Today" show this morning.  We wish
 these- convictions were more widespread.  It
 seems to us, too, our military activities in
 Vietnam are just for nothing-for nothing.
 We have high regard for President Johnson
 and we can't understand why he and Dean
 Rusk and MacNamara, etc.. are for going on
 with this futile war.   How can we bring
 about a change in policy?  It's so tragic to
 see what's happening.
 Respectfully,

 DEAR SENAToII MORSE: Congratulations for
 a rare and courageous voice speaking out for
 a sane and sober approach to our South Viet-
 namese policy.
 As you mentioned, the Vietnamese war is
 McNamara's war-but it also seems true, as
 a reporter questioner put it to you--whether
 the forthcoming election was not a reason
 for the President's warlike activity?
 I believe it is true, that with cessation
 of war, our economy will suffer, unless our
 economic planners work out a program of
 reconversion to peacetime industrial pro-
 duction-the future does not look too bright.
 We all look -forward to your good health
 and clear thinking.

 All the forces there should be under the
 U.N. as you suggest.  He Chi Minh tries to
 run a socialistic government in North Viet-
 nam.  He does not want to be ruled by the
 Chinese Communists.
 Mr. Chakravarty, an Indian intellectual,
 who teaches at Boston University, recently
 spent 3 weeks in and about Saigon. He says
 that it is a reign of terror there, that these
 gentle people had a good agriculture on their
 fertile soil, but you said, I think that U.S.
 Army troops occupy the peninsula, which
 contained the best ricefields.
 Yes, we are letting the Psntagon and the
 arms manufacturers run our foreign rela-
 tions.  When Japan's - military clique got
 power, they brought Japan into the war on
 the side of Hitler.
 The "Today" show is watched by millions
 all across the country.   I am writing to
 congratulate them on having such an able,
 forthright speaker on their program as Sen-
 ator MORSE, from Oregon.

 Washington Letter, Stone's Weekly Let-
 ter:
 One of the best European newsletters,
 Zuericher Wirtenhaftsbrief, who has excel
 lent sources of information, reported from
 Paris that De Gaulle fears President John-
 son might be forced, still before elections,
 into a "strike of violence" against China
 (perhaps to prove that he is as "hard" as
 GOLDWATER).
 One of the two leading Swiss weeklies,
 Zuericher Woche of Zuerich, published on
 June 26, 1964, an editorial with the title
 "America's Janus Head," comparing Amer-
 ica's policy in Cyprus and in southeast Asia.
 After  a positive comment on America's
 policy in Cyprus, it comments on America's
 policy in southeast Asia with the following
 sentences which are doubly remarkable be-
 cause Switzerland is the most anti-Commu-
 nist country in West Europe:
 "In the last 14 days the American warn-
 ings, or rather threats, against North Viet-
 nam and China have been so frequent that it
 is not too early to speak of a dangerous situ-
 ation.  The former commander in Saigon,
 General  Harkins,  could  publicly  declare,
 without being reprimanded, that it would
 be very advantageous to risk war with China,
 in order to protect South Vietnam against a
 Communist takeover.  Between May 17 and
 June 21, American planes, in undisputable
 violation of the Laos agreements, made more
 than 200 reconnaissance and bombing flights
 over the Pathet Lao territory.
 "The appointment of the Chief of the
 General Staff, Maxwell Taylor, as Ambassa-
 dor of the United States of America in Sai-
 gon shows who commands in South Vietnam
 and what is planned. What would the Amer-
 icans say if Marshal Malinowski would be
 appointed as Ambassador  in the  German
 Democratic Republic (East Germany) ?
 "Obviously, the American circles who de-
 cide                                                                                                                 policies,  concluded the  rift between
 Moscow and Peiping became so deep and
 irreparable that China can be treated the
 hard way without Moscow considering this
 as need to assist its ally.  Perhaps these peo-
 ple assume even a silent Russian consent.
 One must warn against this.  Similarly, as
 the Soviet Union went into a trap in Cuba,
 so Washington can get into a trap in south-
 east Asia.  Such action                                                                                                                         could  end  very
 badly."                  -
 In 1939, the German Government risked
 war with Poland, assuming that England
 would stay out.       This error has cost the
 lives of 30 million men, women, and chil-
 dren.  A similar error about China might

 DEAR     SENATOR MORSE:  With reference to
 the press interview on the. TV "Today"
 show that was broadcast at 7:30 a,m., p.s.t.
 on June,25, 1964.
 We most,. heartily agree with you on all
 points.  The Vietnam situation should be
 the function 1 of the United Nations to re-
 solve.                        We as a ngtion have no business
 whatsoever to send our boys to be killed in
 what is really a domestic affair of, another
 nation.  That wornout slogan, "To Fight
 No. 182-19
 Communism", was used by Hitler as the
 excuse for  he the. Germans to conquer the
 entire world.
 No nation need have.4ny fear of commu-
 nism, unless, the people of a nation are
 suffering injustices, such as: unemployment,
 racial discrimination, military dictatorship,
 or the tendency thereto, economic Inequali-
 ties where a portion, of the nation live in
 luxury and a portion. live in dire poverty.
 Our country is fortunate indeer to have
 a Senator with your courage and rational-
 ism, and to fearlessly state the facts as you
 have.  We are proud of your, Sir.  We re-
 gret that we do not have a greater number
 of Senators with the same attributes,
 Sincerely yours,

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:  I wholeheartedly

 Keep up the good work, I have just finished
 writing to President Johnson  supporting
 your position, and am going to write my
 Congressmen and Senators.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I'm sure that a great

 and given fresh hope by your views on yester-
 day's "Today" show of NBC.
 More strength and courage to you and
 others who have now for months given us
 subscribers  to  the  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD
 hope that the U.N. may be brought into a
 peace settlement in Asia.  It seems as if the
 press and news media of all kinds have
 guessed wrongly that your views and points
 in favor of legal action through U.N. should
 be suppressed.  May the new awareness be
 heightened also by a more tolerant view of
 U.N. by Senator CHURCH'S remarks on "To-
 day" this morning.
 Thank you and blessings on your vigorous
 stand for some way to have world authority
 replace U.S. military domination in a new
 world which will not accept the latter.

 Sin: Listening to you on the "Today" pro-
 gram.
 Am only an old woman, but I do now and
 have always admired you.     You talk like I
 feel.  But what can we little people do.  I
 do not like McNamara and never have, he
 even looks too stern. Our Senator YouNG is
 also a good man and does not like this busi-
 ness in Asia.  It bothers me because of our
 boys   getting killed  out  there.  Does our
 country want to rule the world.     Thought
 we were for peace.     Also, I know plenty of
 people who do not like to have our country
 and our boys over in Asia.  But we are noth-
 ing.                                                                       It does not matter how we feel or talk,
 in Washington, they will go ahead and do
 just whatever they like.    I wish they in
 Washington would get rid of the war mon-
 gers.  This is not a fine letter, but this Asian
 thing bothers me a lot.
 And please do all you can to help our boys.
 And we talk about Russia.  Who are we to
 say anything.
 Respectfully,
 JUNE 27, 1964.
 Senator WAYNE MORSE,

 SENATOR MORSE: Enclosed is a Carbon of a
 letter I sent to President Johnson today with
 regard to the dangerous situation in south-
 east Asia.  I want you to know that I will
 do what little I can to see that the U.S.
 military presence is removed from that part
 of the world and that I am grateful for the
 stands that both you and Senator GRUENING
 have taken on that U.S. presence.
 Sincerely,
 President JOHNSON,
 White House,
 Washington, D.C.
 M. PRESIDENT: The increasing involve-
 ment of U.S. money, equipment, and troops
 in southeast Asia is for me a source of rising
 apprehension. It troubles me that when the
 Attorney General of this country can say,
 with regard to three civil rights workers
 In Mississippi, that there is little he can do
 under existing laws, that this same country,
 in southeast Asia, can pursue a policy in
 blatant disregard of the law, the Geneva
 Accord, as well as the sentiments of the
 peoples of both South Vietnam and Laos.
 What can the justification be when the
 Vietcong are fighting a legitimate civil war
 with popular support in South Vietnam, and
 the situation in Laos arises out of the right-
 wing coup d'etat earlier this year rather
 than the withdrawal of the Pathet Lao from
 the coalition government which the coup
 made inevitable.  There can be no justifica-
 tion for a policy that risks total war in an
 area in which we have no rights save that
 in withdrawing we might lose face.  Do we
 not have a greater obligation to all mankind
 to preserve peace?
 If I am called up to fight in southeast
 Asia, I cannot with conscience do anything
 else but refuse.  I will not help to bolster
 a regime so, terribly repressive as that of
 South Vietnam, and though I would not
 hesitate to fight for the legitimate defense
 of our own country, I will not fight in South-
 east Asia.
 Sincerely,
 OLNEY, TEx.,

 DEAR SENATOR: Yesterday I saw you on the
 "Today" program and I believe you are right

 can help, let us know.
