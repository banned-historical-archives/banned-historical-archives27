 Vietnam and the New Isolationism
 HON. THOMAS J. DODD
 OF CONNECTICUT
 IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
 Tuesday, February 23, 1965
 THE NEW ISOLATIONISM
 Mr. DODD.  Mr. President, there has
 been developing in this country in recent
 years a brand of thinking about for
 affairs which, I believe, can aptly be de-
 scribed as "the new isolationism." This
 internal phenomenon is, in my opinion,
 potentially more disastrous in terms of
 its consequence than the major external
 problems that confront us.
 Its background is a growing national
 weariness with cold war burdens we have
 been so long carrying, a rising frustra-
 tion                                with  situations that  are going
 against us in many places, a long-sim-
 mering indignation over the fact that our
 generosity and sacrifice have too often
 been met abroad, not just with indiffer-
 ence and ingratitude, but even with hos-
 tility and contempt.
 Its political base seems to be to the left
 of center, although it forms as yet a dis-
 tinct minority there.
 Its scareword is "escalation"; its cure-
 all is "neutralization."
 Its prophets include some of my col-
 leagues                                in  the  Congress,  influential
 spokesmen in the press, and leading fig-
 ures in the academic? world.  Some are
 new volunteers in this cause of retrench-
 ment; they regard themselves as prag-
 matists. Others are old hands at Polly-
 anna-ism, those unshakable romantics
 who were disillusioned by Moscow at the
 time of the Hitler-Stalin pact, disillu-
 sioned by Mao when they discovered that
 he was not really an agrarian reformer,
 disillusioned by Castro when they learned
 765-428-96923                           (3)
 that he was not a cross between Thomas
 Jefferson and Robin Hood-and who,
 having again dusted themselves off, now
 look for new vistas of adventure.
 If I may digress, let me say that I have
 always admired their durability.  The
 manner in which they have survived, un-
 chastened, a whole series of intellectual
 Dunkirks is, if nothing else, a tribute to
 man's invincible confidence in himself;
 and their adeptness in avoiding discredi-
 tation, in the face of repeated catas-
 trophes and evacuations, must be ac-
 knowledged as one of the marvels of
 modern history-a triumph of self-recti-
 tude over reason.
 The basic premise of the new isola-
 tionism is that the United States is over-
 extended in its attempt to resist Com-
 munist aggression around the world,
 overcommitted to the defense of distant
 outposts, and overinvolved in the murky
 and unintelligible affairs of remote areas.
 The corollaries of the new isolationism
 are many.  It is contended that we
 should deemphasize the cold war and
 reverse our national priorities in favor of
 domestic improvements; that we should
 withdraw from South Vietnam; that we
 should cease involvement in the Congo;
 that we should relax the so-called ri-
 gidity of our Berlin policy; that for-
 eign aid has outlived its usefulness
 and  should  be  severely  cut  back;
 that our Military Establishment and our
 CIA, organizations that seem particu-
 larly suspect because they are symbols of
 worldwide involvement, should be hum-
 bled and "cut down to size" and stripped
 of their influence  in  foreign policy
 questions.
 In my judgment all of these proposi-
 tions have one thing in common.  Each
 of them would strike at the heart of our
 national effort to preserve our freedom
 and our security; and collectively they
 add up to a policy which I can describe

 by no other name than "appeasement,"
 subtle appeasement, unintentional ap-
 peasement, to be sure, but appeasement
 nonetheless.
 My purpose, this afternoon then, is to
 oppose these propositions and to enlist
 Senators' opposition against them-for
 the new isolationism is as bankrupt as
 the old.
 First of all-to tackle the main prem-
 ise-I reject the assumption that the
 United States is overextended, or over-
 committed, or overinvolved.
 We are enjoying a spectacular growth
 in every index of national strength.
 Our population, our wealth, our indus-
 trial capacity, our scientific potential,
 our agricultural output, all are enjoying
 great upward surges.  We were informed
 that our gross national product was
 again up in January, and the trend seems
 ever upward.
 Far from overextending ourselves in
 the cold war, we are actually in a period
 of declining defense budgets, of steadily
 lowered draft calls, of sharply reduced
 foreign aid, of one tax out after another.
 Let me emphasize this: In every basic
 resource, we have greater capacity today
 than during the past 5 years; by every
 military or economic standard, we are
 stronger; and by every physical measure-
 ment, the percentage of our resources
 going into the cold war is lower.  Why
 then should we talk of weariness or over-
 commitment?
 We are not even straining ourselves.
 We are actually pursuing today a policy
 not only of both guns and butter, but of
 less guns and more butter.
 So far as our resources go, we are
 capable of indefinite continuation and
 even intensification of our present ef-
 forts, if need be.  It is only our mental,
 and perhaps our moral, resources which
 seem to be feeling the strain.
 We would, of course, prefer to live in a
 world in which it were possible for us to
 have no commitments, a world in which
 765-428-96923
 we could devote all of our energies to
 the task of perfecting our society at
 home and enriching the lives of our peo-
 ple.
 But we must face the world as it is.
 And the basic fact of our world is that
 Western civilization, itself terribly rent
 and divided, both politically and philo-
 sophically, has been forced into a twi-
 light war of survival by a relentless and
 remorseless enemy.
 It is incontestable, in terms of peoples
 enslaved and nations gobbled up over
 the past 20 years, that we have not been
 holding our own.  And each year, the
 world Communist movement is com-
 mitting more and more of its resources
 to the task of subjugating our allies, all
 around the perimeter of freedom.
 Against this background it is prepos-
 terous to maintain that we should reduce
 our effort and lessen our commitment to
 the great struggle of our century.
 Yet, according to Time magazine, it
 is the widespread sentiment of the aca-
 demic world that we have overreached
 ourselves and ought to pull back.  Walter
 Lippmann, the well-known columnist,
 for whom I have great respect, says that
 "the American tide will have to recede."
 It has been argued that we would be in
 a "precarious situation" if we were at-
 tacked on several fronts.  Of course we
 would, but does anyone believe that we
 can solve the problem by abandoning
 our commitments and defensive alli-
 ances?  Would the loss of these coun-
 tries be any the less disastrous because
 they were given up undefended?
 On the contrary, if we are not strong
 enough to honor our commitments to-
 day, then we should solve the problem,
 not be reducing our commitments, but
 by becoming stronger, and by aiding our
 allies to become stronger.
 The defense of the free world rests on
 a very delicate balance.  The key ele-
 ments in that balance are American
 power and American determination.  If

 we lack the power to maintain that bal-
 ance then certainly all is lost.. If we
 reveal that we lack the determination, if
 we, for instance, allow ourselves to be
 pushed out of Vietnam, such a humilia-
 tion may indeed be the second shot heard
 around the world; and a dozen nations
 might soon throw in the sponge and
 make  whatever  accommodation  they
 could with an enemy that would then
 seem assured of victory.
 Fortunately, at the present time we do
 not lack the power to carry on the de-
 fense of freedom.  Our power is at its
 peak and we have the capacity to in-
 crease it vastly if necessary.  It is our
 spirit, apparently, that needs shoring up.
 Four years ago, after a visit to south-
 east Asia, I said on the floor of the
 Senate:
 If the United States, with its unrivaled
 might, with its unparalleled wealth, with its
 dominion over sea and air, with its heritage
 as the champion of freedom-if this United
 States and its free world allies have so di-
 minished in spirit that they can be laid in
 the dust by a few thousand primitive guer-
 rillas, then we are far down the road from
 which there is no return.
 In right and in might, we are able to work
 our will on this question.  Southeast Asia
 cannot be lost unless we will it to be lost;
 it cannot be saved unless we will it to be
 saved.
 This problem, seemingly so remote and
 distant, will in fact be resolved here in the
 United States, in the Congress, in the ad-
 ministration, and in the minds and hearts
 of the American people.
 The passage of 4 years has not dimin-
 ished my belief in this course.
 If the main premise of the new isola-
 tionism is erroneous, then surely the
 lesser premises are fraught with terrible
 danger.
 It  is argued that we  should de-
 emphasize the cold war and turn more
 of our resources to domestic welfare.
 The  annual  congressional  revolt
 against the foreign aid bill grows more
 765-428-96923
 violent and successful each year, and the
 administration,  forced to yield, now
 sends foreign aid requests 40 percent
 below what it solemnly declared 2 years
 ago to be the minimum figure tolerable
 for free world survival.
 And a small but growing band of
 Senators have begun offering each year
 amendments making across-the-board
 percentage. cuts in our defense budget,
 cuts not directed to any specific econ-
 omy, but rather to a principle-the prin-
 ciple that we should be spending less on
 defense and more on welfare.
 Here,  in my judgment,  are sure-
 fire formulas for defeat.
 Where are the victories in the cold
 war that. would justify such a reversal
 of priorities?  In what global trouble
 spots are there lessened tensions or im-
 proved postures that would make this
 plausible?  I can see a lot of cold war
 areas where things are looking worse-
 but very few where things are getting
 better.
 More effort, more sacrifice-not less-
 is the need of our time. And I speak as
 one who does not disparage the need or
 the importance of domestic improve-
 ments. As a credential of this I recom-
 mend to Senators my scorecard, com-
 piled last year by the ultraconservative
 Americans for Constitutional Action,
 which asserts that I voted right only 13
 percent of the time-one of the worst
 records, alas, in the Congress.
 But I say to you that if our foreign
 affairs are going badly, no aspect of
 internal welfare is secure or stable. And
 if we cope successfully with the great
 problem, the cold war, no internal prob-
 lem can long defy solution.
 Our first national priority is and must
 ever be the survival of our country and
 our freedom-and if the 20th century
 has taught men anything, it is that sur-
 vival and freedom cannot be purchased
 on the cheap, in a discount store or a
 bargain basement.

 But our situation is such that we can
 meet our needs both at home  and
 abroad-not as handsomely as we would
 prefer, but well enough.  This I take to
 be the objective of the Johnson adminis-
 tration.  The war on poverty and the
 struggle against tyranny can go hand in
 hand, if our vision be broad.
 Twenty-five years ago, our country,
 comparatively new and untried among
 the great nations of the earth, through
 passage of the Lend-Lease Act, described
 by Winston Churchill as "the most un-
 sordid act of recorded history," em-
 barked irrevocably upon the path that
 has brought us to our present posture in
 history.  Through that act, we affirmed
 the preservation and expansion of liber-
 ty as our highest goal; we acknowledged
 that freedom was insecure everywhere so
 long as tyranny existed anywhere; and
 we assumed the burden, and the glory,
 of being the champion and defender of
 man's highest aspirations.
 Since that embattled hour, when the
 light of freedom was but a flicker in the
 dark, our journey across the pages of his-
 tory has been fantastic and unprece-
 dented: tragic, to be sure, in its mistakes
 and naivities, but heroic in its innova-
 tions and commitments, prodigious in its
 energy and power, gigantic in its gen-
 erosity and good will, noble in its re-
 straint and patience, and sublime in its
 purpose and in its historic role.
 We have not realized the high goals
 we set for ourselves in World War II.
 But we have preserved freedom and
 national independence in more than half
 the earth; we have prevented the nu-
 clear holocaust; we have restored West-
 ern Europe; we have helped friend and
 foe to achieve prosperity, freedom and
 stability; we have launched a world peace
 organization and have kept it alive; we
 have offered the hand of friendship and
 help to the impoverished and backward
 peoples of the world if they will but
 take it.
 765-428-96923
 It may be said of our country today,
 as of no other in history, that wherever
 people are willing to stand up in defense
 of their liberty, Americans stand with
 them.
 We cannot know at this hour whether
 our journey has just begun or is nearing
 its climax; whether the task ahead is the
 work of a generation, or of a century.
 President Kennedy said, in his Inaugural
 Address, that the conflict would not be
 resolved in our lifetime.
 The Chief of Staff of the Army recently
 told the Congress that it might well take
 10 years to decide the issue in Vietnam
 alone.  And Vietnam is only one symp-
 tom of the disease, the epidemic, we are
 resisting.
 Against this somber background, how
 foolish it is to talk of deemphasizing the
 cold war, of pulling out of Vietnam, of
 abandoning the Congo to Communist
 intrigue, of slashing the defense budget
 by 10 percent, or of any of the other ir-
 responsibilities of the new isolationism.
 VIETNAM
 It is against this background that I
 take up today the question of Vietnam,
 which has been the favorite target of
 those who urge withdrawal and re-
 trenchment.
 Over the past several months, a num-
 ber of my most respected colleagues have
 taken the floor to urge that we get out of
 Vietnam or that we enter into negotia-
 tions over Vietnam.
 The propriety of our presence in Viet-
 nam and the validity of our position has
 been challenged.  It has even been sug-
 gested that we are the real aggressors in
 Vietnam. The war has been called "Mc-
 Namara's War."                                                                                   It has been suggested
 that we more or less ignore Asia and
 Africa and concentrate on Europe and
 the Americas.
 I have listened with growing dismay
 to these presentations-and with all the
 more dismay because of the respect and

 affection I have for the Senators who
 made them.
 If I have not risen to reply to my
 colleagues before now, it was not be-
 cause Vietnam was a new subject to me,
 but because I felt that their arguments
 required the most carefully considered
 and most painstakingly prepared reply.
 I had visited most of the countries
 of southeast Asia in early 1961, and I
 have spoken a number of times on the
 floor of the Senate on the subject of
 Vietnam and Laos and Indonesia since
 my return.  I have endeavored to keep
 up with the situation in that part of the
 world as best one can do by reading
 the press and official publications.  But
 I realized that there were important gaps
 in my information because the press cov-
 erage of Vietnam was, with a few out-
 standing exceptions, weak and in some
 cases completely misleading.  I have,
 therefore, sought to fill these gaps by
 correspondence with friends in Vietnam,
 both Vietnamese and American, and by
 conversations with Americans who have
 served in Vietnam in various capacities-
 some of them for long periods of time.
 The senior Senator from Wyoming
 [Mr. McGEE] and the senior Senator
 from Oklahoma [Mr. MONRONEY] on the
 one side, and the distinguished minority
 leader, the junior Senator from Illinois
 [Mr. DIRKSEN]  and the senior Senator
 from Massachusetts  [Mr. SALTONSTALL]
 have already spoken eloquently on the
 need for standing fast in Vietnam.
 A debate has been joined which is
 worthy of the best traditions of the
 Senate.
 I hope that the remarks I make today
 will contribute at least in some measure,
 to the further unfolding of this debate.
 Out of this debate, let us hope, will ulti-
 mately emerge the kind of assistance and
 guidance that every President must have
 in dealing with vital issues of our for-
 eign policy.

 What we say here may help to guide
 the President. But in the final analysis
 the terrible responsibility of decision is
 his and his alone. He must listen to the
 exchanges which take place in this
 Chamber.  He must endure a hundred
 conflicting pressures from public sources,
 seeking to push him in this direction
 or that.  He must also endure the im-
 patience of those who demand answers
 to complex questions today, and who
 accuse him of not having made the
 American position clear when he has in
 fact made our position abundantly clear
 on repeated occasions.
 And finally, when all the voices have
 been heard, when he has examined all
 the facts, when he has discussed all as-
 pects of the situation with his most
 trusted advisers, the President must alone
 decide-for all Americans and for the
 entire free world-what to do about
 Vietnam.
 No President has ever inherited a more
 difficult situation on coming to office.
 No President has ever been called upon
 to make a decision of greater moment.
 At stake may be the survival of freedom.
 At stake may be the peace of the world.
 I believe the United States can count
 itself fortunate that it has found a Presi-
 dent of the stature of Lyndon B. Johnson
 to meet this crisis in its history.  I also
 believe that, whatever differences we in
 this Chamber may have on the question
 of Vietnam, our feelings to a man are
 with the President in the ordeal of deci-
 sion through which he is now passing.
 I have said that I have been dismayed
 by the rising clamor for a negotiated
 settlement.  In the type of war which
 the Communists are now waging against
 us, I fear that, although those who urge
 negotiation would be among the first to
 oppose an outright capitulation, their at-
 titude may not be construed in this way
 by the Communists.
 The Vietnamese war, in the Commu-
 nist lexicon, is described as a "war of

 8
 national  liberation."  Its strategy is
 based on the concept of what the Com-
 munists call "the long war." This strat-
 egy is premised upon the belief that the
 free  world  lacks  the  patience,  the
 stamina, the fanatical determination to
 persist, which inspires the adherents of
 communism.  It is based on the convic-
 tion that if the Communists keep on at-
 tacking and attacking and attacking in
 any given situation, they will ultimately
 be able to destroy the morale and the will
 to resist of those who oppose them in the
 name of freedom.
 China affords the classic example of
 the long war.  It took 20 years for Mao
 Tse-tung to prevail.  There were several
 times during this period when his entire
 movement seemed on the verge of col-
 lapse.  But, even in his blackest days,
 Mao Tse-tung remained confident that,
 if he persevered, ultimately his enemies
 would crack and he would emerge as
 China's undisputed ruler.
 There is no more cruel test of courage
 and staying power than "the long war"
 as it is waged by the Communists.  Five
 years, 10 years, 20 years, means nothing
 to them.  And if they detect any sign
 that those opposed to them are flagging,
 that their patience is growing thin or
 that their will to resist has weakened, the
 Communists can be relied upon to re-
 double their efforts, in the belief that vic-
 tory is within their grasp.
 I disagree strongly with my colleagues
 who have spoken up to urge negotiations.
 But if there is any way in which my
 voice could reach to Peiping and to Mos-
 cow, I would warn the Communist lead-
 ers that they should not construe the
 debate that is now taking place in this
 Chamber as a sign of weakness; it is,
 on the contrary, a testimony to our
 strength.
 Nor should they believe that those who
 speak up in favor of negotiations are the
 forerunners of a larger host. of Ameri-
 cans who are prepared to accept sur-
 765-428--96923
 render.  Because there is no one here
 who believes in surrender or believes in
 capitulation. I believe the senior Sena-
 tor from Idaho made this abundantly
 clear in his own presentation, in which
 he underscored his complete support for
 the retaliatory air strikes against North
 Vietnam.
 I have been amazed by a number of
 letters I have received asking the ques-
 tion, "Why are we in Vietnam?" or
 "What is our policy in Vietnam?" I have
 been even more amazed to have the same
 questions put to me by sophisticated
 members of the press.
 To me the reasons for our presence in
 Vietnam are so crystal clear that I find
 it difficult to comprehend the confusion
 which now appears to exist on this sub-
 ject.
 We are in Vietnam because our own
 security and the security of the entire
 free world demands that a firm line be
 drawn against the further advance of
 Communist  imperialism-in  Asia,  in
 Africa, in Latin America, and in Europe.
 We are in Vietnam because it is our
 national interest to assist every nation,
 large and small, which is seeking to de-
 fend itself against Communist subver-
 sion, infiltration, and aggression. There
 is nothing new about this policy; it is a
 policy, in fact, to which every admin-
 istration has adhered since the procla-
 mation of the Truman doctrine.
 We are in Vietnam because our as-
 sistance was invited by the legitimate
 government of that country.
 We are in Vietnam because, as the dis-
 tinguished majority leader, the Senator
 from Montana [Mr. MANSFIELD], pointed
 out in his 1963 report, Chinese Commu-
 nist  hostility  to  the  United  States
 threatens "the whole structure of our
 own security in the Pacific."
 We are in Vietnam not merely to help
 the 14 million South Vietnamese defend
 themselves against communism, but be-

 cause what is at stake is the independ-
 ence and freedom of 240 million people
 in southeast Asia and the future of free-
 dom throughout the western Pacific.
 These are the reasons why we are in
 Vietnam.  There is nothing new about
 them and nothing very complex.  They
 have never been obscure.  They have
 never been concealed. I cannot, for the
 life of me, see why people fail to under-
 stand them.
 IS THERE A POSSIBILITY OF A NEGOTIATED
 SETTLEMENT?
 The senior Senator from Idaho, and
 several other Senators who spoke last
 Wednesday, repeated the proposal that
 we should seek negotiations for the pur-
 pose of terminating the bloodshed in
 Vietnam and of avoiding an enlarge-
 ment of the war.  We are told by some
 people that negotiations are the way of
 diplomacy and that if we reject negotia-
 tions now, we are in effect rejecting
 diplomacy.
 The proposal that we negotiate now
 overlooks the fact that there does exist
 a negotiated agreement on Vietnam, ap-
 proved by the participants of the Geneva
 Conference of 1964.  The final declara-
 tion of this agreement read, and I think
 it is worth while reading it for the REc-
 ORD and for our own recollection:
 Each member * * * undertakes to respect
 the sovereignty, the independence, the unity,
 and the territorial integrity of the above-
 mentioned states and to refrain from any
 interference in their internal affairs.
 Since there is no point to negotiating
 if it simply means reiterating the Gene-
 va agreement, I cannot help wondering
 whether those who urge negotiations en-
 visage rewriting the agreement so that
 it does not "guarantee the territorial in-
 tegrity of the above-mentioned states."
 The history of negotiated agreements
 with the Communists underscores the
 fact that their promises are worthless
 and that only those agreements have
 765-428-96923
 validity which  are  self-enforcing  or
 which we have the power to enforce.  A
 report issued by the Senate Subcommit-
 tee on Internal Security-on which I
 have the honor to serve-establishes that
 the Soviet Union has since its inception
 violated more than 1,000 treaties and
 agreements.  The Communists have re-
 peatedly violated the terms of the Ko-
 rean armistice, of the Geneva agreement
 on Vietnam, and of the Laotian armis-
 tice.
 Incidentally, I had hoped the Senator
 from Idaho [Mr. CHURCH] would be pres-
 ent.                                                                         He had hoped to be here.  He is
 tied up on another matter, but hopes to
 get here later.
 The Senator from Idaho has held up
 the Laotian armistice as an example of
 a rational agreement with the Commu-
 nists that has served our interests.  He
 could not possibly have picked a worse
 illustration for his argument.
 I can think of no more dramatic proof
 than the Laotian armistice that agree-
 ments with the Communists are worth-
 less, and that every time we try to escape
 from today's unpleasantness by entering
 into a new covenant with an implacable
 aggressor, we are always confronted on
 the morrow by unpleasantness com-
 pounded 10 times over.
 I traveled through southeast Asia just
 before the conclusion of the Laotian
 armistice.
 I talked to many people at that time.
 It is true that the armistice was favored
 by our Ambassador in Laos, and it ob-
 viously must have had the support of
 important members of the State Depart-
 ment hierarchy.  But the personnel of
 our Embassies in Saigon and in Bangkok
 did not conceal from me their grave ap-
 prehensions over the consequences of
 such an armistice for Vietnam and
 southeast Asia.
 All of this I, reported on confidentially
 upon my return.
 Approved For Release 2003/12/02 : CIA-RDP75-00149R000200310041-4

 At that time, the Saigon government
 still controlled the situation throughout
 most of the countryside, although the
 15,000 Vietcong guerrillas were giving it
 increasing difficulty.  Our Embassy per-
 sonnel in Saigon expressed the fear that
 the conclusion of the Laotian armistice
 would enable the Communists to infil-
 trate men and material on a much larger
 scale and would result at an early date
 in a marked intensification of the Viet-
 cong insurgency.  Needless to say, the
 apprehensions which they expressed to
 me have been completely borne out by
 subsequent developments.
 The Laotian armistice has served Laos
 itself as poorly as it has served the cause
 of freedom in Vietnam.  The Commu-
 nists have continued to nibble away at
 what is left of free Laos, in one aggres-
 sive act after another, so that by now
 they firmly control more than half the
 country, while their infiltress and guer-
 rillas are gnawing relentlessly at govern-
 ment authority  in the  rest of  the
 country.       -
 In mid-1964, I asked the Library of
 Congress to prepare for me a study of
 Communist violations of the Laotian
 armistice agreement.  The study which
 they submitted to me listed 14 specific
 violations up until that time.
 That was last year. There have been
 many more since then.
 Mr. President, I plan to insert into the
 RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks
 a copy of the survey of Communist vio-
 lations of the Laotian armistice prepared
 for me by the Library of Congress.  I
 earnestly hope the Senator from Idaho
 will take the time to study this before
 he once again holds up the Loatian armi-
 stice as a model for Vietnam.
 I should also like to quote from a
 statement made on March 30, 1963, by
 Gen. Kong Le, the neutralist military
 commander who, as is common knowl-
 edge, had favored the conclusion of the
 Laotian armistice. Kong Le's statement
 765--428-96923
 is significant because it illustrates how
 Communists will deal tomorrow with
 non-Communist elements that they are
 prepared to accept into coalition gov-
 ernments today.
 Referring  to  certain  Communist
 stooges, Gen. Kong Le said:
 Despite their continual defeats, however,
 these people learned their lessons from their
 Communist bosses. * * * When the Prime
 Minister went abroad, they moved rapidly to
 destroy the neutralist forces.  They used
 tricks to provoke the soldiers and people to
 overthrow Colonel Ketsana.  When these did
 not succeed, on February 12 they used an as-
 sassin to murder Ketsana. They also savage-
 ly killed or arrested all neutralist party
 members, and their bloody hands caused the
 death of many people.
 This  was  the  statement  of  Gen.
 Kong Le, one of those who had pressed
 the hardest for the Laotian armistice,
 after he saw what the armistice had done
 to his country.
 Finally, I do not believe that the Lao-
 tian armistice has served the interests
 of the other peoples of southeast Asia.
 I have in my possession a map of north-
 ern Laos showing areas where the Chi-
 nese Communists have been building
 roads that would give China direct ac-
 cess to the borders of Burma and Thai-
 land.  The construction of these roads
 bodes ill for the future peace of south-
 east Asia.  That they are intended for
 future military use is taken for granted
 by everyone in the area.
 So much for the example of the Lao-
 tian armistice.
 All this does not mean to say that we
 must not under any circumstances enter
 into negotiations with the Communists.
 I do not suggest that at all.  It simply
 means that when we do so, we must do
 so with our eyes open and with a clear
 understanding of the ingredients re-
 quired to enforce compliance with the
 agreement about to be entered into.
 That is all I have ever urged.

 Moreover, there is a time to negotiate
 and a time not to negotiate.
 The demand that we negotiate now
 over Vietnam is akin to asking Churchill
 to negotiate with the Germans at the
 time of Dunkirk, or asking Truman to
 negotiate with the Communists when
 we stood with our backs to the sea in the
 Pusan perimeter in . Korea.  In either
 case, the free world could have negoti-
 ated nothing but total capitulation.
 The situation in Vietnam is probably
 not as desperate and certainly no more
 desperate, than Britain's plight at the
 time of Dunkirk or our own plight at
 the time of Pusan.  If we are of good
 heart, if we refuse to listen to the coun-
 sels of despair, if we again resolve that
 "we will never give in"-as Churchill
 put it-there is every reason to be con-
 fident that a time will arrive when we
 can negotiate with honor and for a more
 acceptable objective than a diplomatic
 surrender.
 There are those who say that the
 whole of southeast Asia will, whether
 we like it or not, go Communist. These
 people are at least consistent in urging
 negotiations now.  But anyone who be-
 lieves that we can negotiate now and
 nob lose Vietnam to communism is de-
 luding himself in the worst possible way.
 THE CONSEQUENCES OF DEFEAT  IN VIETNAM
 It is human to oppose the cost of stay-
 ing on in Vietnam when American boys
 are dying in a faraway land about
 which we understand very little.  I am
 conscious of this.  I am sensitive to it.
 I share the troubled minds of all Sena-
 tors. But I am convinced that the great
 majority of those who advocate that we
 abandon Vietnam to communism, either
 by pulling out or by "negotiating" a set-
 tlement, have not taken the time to
 weigh the consequences of defeat.
 . In my opinion, the consequences of an
 American defeat in Vietnam would be
 so catastrophic that we simply cannot
 765-428-96923
 permit ourselves to think of it.  This is
 truly an "unthinkable thought," to use
 an expression coined by the Senator
 from Arkansas.  He was not applying it
 to this problem, I point out, but I find
 the words particularly apt in reference
 to Vietnam.
 GENOCIDE
 For the Vietnamese people, the first
 consequence would be a bloodletting on
 a genocidal scale.
 In the Soviet Union and in Red China,
 tens of millions of "class enemies" were
 eliminated by the victorious Communists.
 While it is true that there are some
 slightly more moderate Communist re-
 gimes in certain countries, Vietnamese
 communism is characterized by utter
 disregard for human life of Stalinism
 and Maoism.  What will happen to the
 more than 1 million refugees from North
 Vietnam?  What will happen to the mil-
 lions of peasants who resisted or bore
 arms against the Vietcong.  I shudder
 to think of it. The massacre of inno-
 cents in Vietnam will be repeated in every
 southeast Asian country that falls to
 communism in its wake, in a gigantic
 bloodletting that will dwarf the agony
 and suffering of the war in Vietnam.
 Those who urge our withdrawal from
 Vietnam in the name of saving human
 lives have the duty to consider the rec-
 ord of Communist terror in every country
 that has fallen under the sway of this
 merciless ideology, with its total disre-
 gard for human life.
 The total number of victims of commu-
 nism will probably never be known.  Stu-
 dents who have followed the Chinese
 Communist press closely claim that it can
 be demonstrated that Chinese commu-
 nism has cost the lives of at least 25
 million and more, probably 50 million
 people, while students of Soviet commu-
 nism put the overall figure for the So-
 viet Union at approximately the same
 level.  They point out that, entirely
 apart from the purges and mass killings

 12
 at periodic intervals and the forced star-
 vation of 5 million Ukrainian farmers,
 the reported death rate in the Soviet
 forced labor camps ran approximately
 25 percent per annum in bad years, and
 15 to 20 percent in good years.  If one
 accepts the average population of the
 slave labor camps as 10 million over the
 20 odd years of Stalin's undisputed rule,
 this would mean that approximately 2
 million slave laborers died annually in
 Stalin's camps, or 40 million for the 20-
 year period.
 According to the Polish Government
 in exile, in London, the Soviets deported
 11/2 million Poles to Siberia after they
 had occupied eastern Poland in the wake
 of ? the  Hitler-Stalin  pact.  Approxi-
 mately 150,000 were returned through
 Teheran after the Nazi invasion of Rus-
 sia.  Another 300,000 drifted back after
 the war.  More than 1 million never
 came back.  Such was the mortality in
 the Soviet slave labor camps.
 All of this seems incredible to the
 Western mind.
 I remember, when I was in Nuremburg,
 that when I first read the terrible sta-
 tistics about the mass killings by the
 Nazis, I could not comprehend them.  If
 I suggested to Senators that a train
 wreck had occurred in which 100 persons
 had lost their lives, or a shipwreck in
 which 150 had lost their lives, or some
 common. disaster with hundreds or even
 thousands of lives lost, we would react,
 we would feel it.  But if I suggested that
 1 million murders had taken place, our
 minds would not be able to grasp the
 enormity of such a crime.
 Perhaps that is just as well.  There
 must be built into our intellectual mech-
 anism some kind of governor.                                  Unfortu-
 nately, while it does probably save us
 from insanity, the fact that our minds
 cannot comprehend the murder of 1 mil-
 lion people or 40 million people serves as
 a protective asset to the perpetrator of
 such an evil deed.  It does not make the
 .765-428-96923
 crime any less horrible.  It simply makes
 our task that much more difficult.
 Even after Khrushchev's denunciation
 of Stalin confirmed all the essential
 charges that had been made against the
 Soviet regime, men of good will in the
 Western World refused to believe that
 the Communist regime could be so, evil.
 They refused to believe, because it is dif-
 ficult for them to conceive of horror and
 brutality on such a mass scale.
 To those who refuse to believe, I would
 like to read the eloquent words penned by
 Dr. Julius Margolin, a prominent Jewish
 leader in prewar Lithuania, one of the
 scores of thousands of Lithuanians, de-
 ported to Soviet slave labor camps after
 the Soviet occupation of his country.
 When he was released after 7 years in
 the camps, Dr. Margolin wrote:
 Until the fall of 1939, 1 had assumed a
 position of benevolent neutrality toward the
 U,S.S.R. * * * The last 7 years have made
 me a convinced and ardent foe of the Soviet
 system.  I hate this system with all the
 strength of my heart and all the power of
 my mind.  Everything I have seen there has
 filled me with horror and disgust which will
 last until the end of my days. ?I feel that
 the struggle against this system of slavery,
 terrorism, and cruelty which prevails there
 constitutes the primary obligation of every
 man in this world.  Tolerance or support of
 such an international shame is not permis-
 sible for people who are on this side of the
 Soviet border and who live under normal
 conditions. * * *
 Millions of men are perishing in the camps
 of the Soviet Union. * * *  Since they came
 into being, the Soviet camps have swallowed
 more people, have executed more victims,
 than  all  the  other  camps-Hitler's  in-
 cluded-together; and this lethal engine con-
 tinues to operate full blast.
 And those who in reply only shrug their
 shoulders and try to dismiss the issue with
 vague and meaningless generalities, I con-
 sider moral abetters and accomplices of ban-
 ditry.                   1

 saving human lives weigh the words of
 Dr. Julius Margolin-a man who, like
 themselves, refused to believe that com-
 munism could be so inhuman until he saw
 its punitive machinery at work with his
 own eyes.
 And if the administration should ever
 succumb to their pressure and negotiate
 the surrender of Vietnam, and if the
 Vietnamese Communists then embark on
 the orgy of bloodletting which has always
 accompanied the establishment of Com-
 munist power, let those who are pressur-
 ing for negotiations not be heard to say,
 "But we didn't intend it this way."  Be-
 cause there is today no excuse for igno-
 rance about communism.
 (B)  THE  FURTHER  CHOICE:  COMPLETE WITH-
 DRAWAL                                              OR MAJOR   ESCALATION
 Our withdrawal from Vietnam would
 immediately confront us with an agoniz-
 ing choice.
 If we decide to try to defend what is
 left of southeast Asia against the advance
 of communism, it will require far more
 money, far more men, and far more
 American blood than we are today in-
 vesting in the defense of Vietnam. What
 is more, it would involve a far greater risk
 of the major escalation which we seek
 to avoid.
 If, on the other hand, we decide to
 abandon the whole of southeast Asia to
 communism, as some of the proponents
 of withdrawal have frankly proposed, it
 would result in the early disintegration
 of all our alliances, and in the total
 eclipse of America as a great nation.
 Because no nation can remain great when
 its assurances are considered worthless
 even by its friends.
 (C)  MORE VIETNAMS
 Whether we decide to abandon south-
 east Asia or to try to draw another line
 outside Vietnam, the loss of Vietnam will
 result in a dozen more Vietnams in dif-
 ferent parts of the world. If we.cannot
 cope with this type of warfare in Viet-
 765-428-96923
 nam, the Chinese Communists will be en-
 couraged in the belief that we cannot
 cope with it anywhere else.
 In the Congo, the Chinese Communists
 have launched their first attempt at ap-
 plying the Vietnamese strategy to Africa.
 In the Philippines, the Huk guerrillas,
 after being decisively defeated in the
 early 1950's, have now staged a dramatic
 comeback.  According to the New York
 Times, the Huks are now active again in
 considerable strength, control large areas
 of central Luzon, and are assassinating
 scores of village heads and local admin-
 istrators on the Vietcong pattern.
 In Thailand, Red China has already
 announced the formation of a patriotic
 front to overthrow the Government and
 eradicate American influence. This al-
 most certainly presages the early launch-
 ing of a Thai Communist insurrection,
 also patterned after the Vietcong.
 An article in the Washington Post on
 January 16, pointed out that the Vene-
 zuelan Communists now have 5,000 men
 under arms in the cities and in the
 countryside, and that the Venezuelan
 Communist Party is openly committed to
 "the strategy of a long war, as developed
 in China, Cuba, Algeria, and Vietnam."
 And there are at least half a dozen
 other Latin American countries where
 the Communists are fielding guerrilla
 forces, which may be small today, but
 which would be encouraged by a Com-
 munist victory in Vietnam to believe that
 the West has no defense against the
 long war.
 It is interesting to note in this con-
 nection that, according to Cuban re-
 ports,  a  Vietcong  delegation  which
 came to Havana in 1964 signed a "mu-
 tual aid pact" with the Venezuelan guer-
 rilla  forces.  In  addition, Marguerite
 Higgins, the distinguished correspondent
 for the Washington Star and other
 papers, points out that Vietcong experts
 have teamed up with experts from Com-
 munist China and the Soviet Union in

 training Latin Americans for guerrilla
 operations in the several schools main-
 tained by Fidel Castro.
 (D)  WHAT NEW DEFENSE LINE?
 It has been suggested that if we aban-
 don southeast Asia, our seapower would
 make it possible for us to fall back on
 Japan and the Philippines and the oth-
 er. Pacific islands, and constitute a more
 realistic defense line there. This is non-
 sense.  American seapower and Ameri-
 can nuclear power have thus far proved
 impotent to cope with Communist politi-
 cal warfare.  Cuba is the best proof of
 this.
 If we abandon southeast Asia, the
 Philippines may prove impossible to
 hold against a greatly stepped-up Huk
 insurgency.
 Japan, even if it remains non-Commu-
 nist, would probably, by force of circum-
 stances, be compelled to come to terms
 with Red China, adding the enormous
 strength of its economy to Communist
 strategic resources.
 Okinawa, where our political position
 is already difficult, would become politi-
 cally impossible to hold.
 If we fail to draw the line in Viet-
 nam, in short, we may find ourselves
 compelled to draw a defense line as far
 back as Seattle and Alaska, with Hawaii
 as a solitary outpost in mid-Pacific.
 (E)  THE  ECLIPSE  OF  AMERICAN  PRESTIGE
 To all those who agree that we must
 carefully weigh the consequences of
 withdrawal before we commit ourselves
 to withdrawal, I would refer the recent
 words of the well-known Filipino politi-
 cal  commentator,  Vincente  Villamin.
 The abandonment of Vietnam, wrote Mr.
 Villamin, "would be an indelible blemish
 on America's honor.  It would reduce
 America in the estimation of mankind
 to a dismal third-rate power, despite her
 wealth, her culture and her nuclear ar-
 senal.                             It would make every American
 ashamed of his Government and would
 965-428-96923
 make every individual American dis-
 trusted everywhere on earth."
 This is strong language.  But from
 conversations with a number of Asians, I
 know that it is an attitude shared by
 many of our best friends in Asia.
 VIETNAM AND MUNICH
 The situation in Vietnam today bears
 many resemblances to the situation just
 before Munich.
 Chamberlain wanted peace. Churchill
 Wanted peace.
 Churchill said that if the free world
 failed to draw the line against Hitler at
 an early stage, it would be compelled to
 draw the line under much more difficult
 circumstances at a later date.
 Chamberlain held that a confronta-
 tion with Hitler might result in war, and
 that the interests of peace demanded
 some concessions to Hitler.  Czechoslo-
 vakia, he said, was a faraway land about
 which we knew very little.
 Chamberlain  held  that    a  durable
 agreement could be negotiated with Hit-
 ler that would guarantee "peace in our
 time."
 How I remember those words.
 Churchill held that the appeasement
 of a compulsive aggressor simply whet-
 ted his appetite for further expansion
 and made war more likely.
 Chamberlain's policy won out, because
 nobody wanted war. When he came back
 from Munich, he was hailed not only by
 the Tories, but by the Liberals, and the
 Labor Party people, including leftwing-
 ers like James Maxton  and  Fenner
 Brockway.
 Churchill remained a voice crying in
 the wilderness.
 But     who  was  right-Churchill or
 Chamberlain?
 Who was the true man of peace?
 In Vietnam today, we are again deal-
 ing with a faraway land, about which
 we know very little.
 In Vietnam today, we are again con-
 fronted by an incorrigible aggressor,

 fanatically committed to the destruc-
 tion of the free world, whose agree-
 ments are as worthless as Hitler's.  In-
 deed, even while the Communist propa-
 ganda apparatus is pulling out all the
 stops to pressure us into a diplomatic
 surrender in Vietnam, the Chinese Com-
 munists are openly encouraging a new
 Huk insurgency in the Philippines and
 have taken the first step in opening a
 Vietcong type insurgency in Thailand
 through the creation of their quisling
 Thai patriotic front.
 In signing the Munich agreement, it
 was not Chamberlain's intention to sur-
 render the whole of Czechoslovakia to
 Hitler.  The agreement was limited to
 the transfer of the German-speaking
 Sudetenland  to  German  sovereignty.
 And no one was more indignant than
 Chamberlain when Hitler, having de-
 prived Czechoslovakia of her mountain
 defenses, proceeded to take over the
 entire country.
 While there are some proponents of
 a diplomatic solution who are willing
 to face up to the fact that negotiations
 at this juncture mean surrender, there
 are others who apparently quite hon-
 estly believe that we can arrive at a
 settlement that will both end the war
 and preserve the freedom of the South
 Vietnamese people.  If such negotia-
 tions should ever come to pass, I am
 certain that the story of Czechoslovakia
 would be repeated.  Having deprived
 South Vietnam of the political and mil-
 itary capability to resist, the North Viet-
 namese Communists would not tarry
 long before they completely communized
 the country.
 And, before very long, those who urge
 a diplomatic solution for the sake of
 preventing war, may find themselves
 compelled to fight the very war that
 they were seeking to avoid, on a bigger
 and bloodier scale, and from a much
 more difficult line of defense.
 I take it for granted that no one in
 this Chamber and no loyal American
 765-428-96923
 citizen believes that we should stand by
 indifferently while  communism takes
 over the rest of the world.
 I take it for granted that every in-
 telligent person realizes that America
 could not long survive as a free nation
 in a  world  that  was  completely
 Communist.
 I take it for granted that everyone
 agrees that somewhere, somehow, we
 must draw the line against further
 Communist expansion.
 The question that separates us, there-
 fore, is not whether such a line should
 be drawn, but where such a line should
 be drawn.
 I believe that we have been right in
 drawing the line in Vietnam and that
 President Johnson is right in trying to
 hold the line in Vietnam, despite the
 setbacks we have suffered over the past
 year.  Because, if this line falls, let us
 have no illusions about the difficulty of
 drawing a realistic line of defense any-
 where in the western Pacific.
 NEITHER SURRENDER NOR ESCALATION
 We have been told in many statements
 and articles that the only alternative to
 withdrawal from Vietnam, with or with-
 out negotiations, is a dramatic escala-
 tion of the war against the North. And
 we have been warned that such an esca-
 lation might bring in both Red China
 and the Soviet Union and might bring
 about the thermonuclear holocaust that
 no one wants.
 These are supposed to be the choices
 before us.
 It is my belief, however, that the tide
 of war in Vietnam can be reversed and
 that this war can ultimately be won
 without an invasion of the North and
 without a significant intensification of
 our military effort.  It is my belief that
 there are many measures we can take,
 primarily in the nonmilitary field, to
 strengthen our posture and the posture
 of South Vietnamese forces in the fight
 against the Vietcong insurgency.

 Before outlining some of the measures
 which I believe can and must be taken,
 I wish to deal with a number of widely
 accepted fallacies and misconceptions
 about the situation in Vietnam, because
 one cannot intelligently approach the
 problem of what to do about Vietnam
 without first establishing the essential
 facts about the present situation in that
 country.
 THE FALLACY THAT THE VIETNAMESE WAR IS A
 The belief that the Vietnamese war is
 a civil war is one of the most widespread
 misconceptions about Vietnam.  This is
 frequently associated with the charge
 that it is the United States, and not
 North Vietnam or Red China, which is
 intervening in South Vietnam.
 The war in South Vietnam is not a
 civil war.  It was instigated in the first
 place by the North Vietnamese Commu-
 nists, with the material and moral sup-
 port of both Peiping and Moscow. There
 is overwhelming proof that Hanoi has
 provided the leadership for the Vietcong
 insurrection, that it has supplied them
 massively, and that. it has served as the
 real command headquarters for the Viet-
 cong.
 The present insurrection in South
 Vietnam goes back to the third Commu-
 nist Party Congress in Hanoi in Septem-
 ber of 1960.  At this. Congress it was
 decided "to liberate South Vietnam from
 the ruling yoke of the U.S. Imperialists
 and their henchmen in order to achieve
 national unity and complete independ-
 ence." The Congress also called for the
 creation of a broad national front in
 South Vietnam directed against the
 United  States-Diem  clique.   Several
 months later the formation of the front
 for the liberation of the south. was an-
 nounced.
 I understand that there is an official
 report, according to which, the U.S. Mili-
 tary Assistants Command in Vietnam is
 in possession of reliable evidence indi-
 765-428-96923
 eating that probably as many as 34,000
 Vietcong infiltrators have entered South
 Vietnam from the north between Jan-
 uary 1959 and August 1964.
 The report indicates that the majority
 of hard-core Vietcong officers and the
 bulk of specialized personnel such as
 communications and heavy weapons spe-
 cialists have been provided through in-
 filtration. Infiltrators, moreover, appar-
 ently make up the major part of Vietcong
 regulars in the northern half of South
 Vietnam.
 The infiltration from the north sup-
 plies the Vietcong with much of its
 leadership, specialist personnel, key sup-
 plies such as heavy ordnance and com-
 munications equipment, and, in some
 cases, elite troops.
 This information is derived from the
 interrogation of many thousands of Viet-
 cong captives and defectors and from
 captured documents.
 It is this hard core that has come
 down from the north that has provided
 the leadership cadres in all major in-
 surgent actions, including the series of
 sensational attacks on American instal-
 lations.
 The scale on which. Hanoi has been
 supplying the Vietcong insurgency was
 dramatically illustrated  this weekend
 when an attack by an American helicop-
 ter on a ship off the coast of South Viet-
 nam resulted in the discovery of an enor-
 mous arms cache-almost enough, in the
 words of one American officer, to equip
 an entire division. The haul included a
 thousand Russian-made carbines, hun-
 dreds of Russian submachine guns, and
 light machine guns, and Chinese burp
 guns, and scores of tons of ammunition.
 There were also a variety of sophisticated
 land mines and ammunition for a new
 type of rocket launcher used against
 tanks.  A Communist guerrilla who was
 captured in the action said that the ship
 which delivered the weapons had made

 17
 six trips to bases along the South Viet-
 nam coast, dropping off supplies.
 Finally, we would do well to consider
 the fact that the  general  offensive
 launched by the Communist forces in
 Vietnam 2 weeks ago was preceded by an
 open call by Hanoi radio for assaults
 throughout the country on Vietnamese
 and American positions.
 The public confusion on the nature of
 the Vietnamese war stems in large meas-
 ure from the sabotage of the Communist
 member of the three-man International
 Control Commission set up to supervise
 the carrying out of the-Geneva agree-
 ment. By 1961, reports of 1,200 offensive
 incidents of Communist agents, ranging
 from one-man assassinations to large-
 scale military actions, had been pre-
 sented to the Commission. The Commis-
 sion, however, took no action because the
 Polish Communist member consistently
 refused to investigate reports of North
 Vietnamese intervention in South Viet-
 nam.  In this way, this entire massive
 body of evidence of Hanoi's Intervention
 in South Vietnam was muted and ren-
 dered ineffective.
 In order to understand the war in Viet-
 nam, we have to get away from tradi-
 tional concepts in which armies with
 their own insignias cross clearly marked
 national demarcation lines after their
 governments have duly declared war.
 Communist guerrilla warfare is waged
 without any declaration of war. In the
 case of Vietnam, it is waged from exter-
 nal sanctuaries which claim immunity to
 attack because the state which harbors
 them has not formally declared war.
 It blends military cadres who have in-
 filtrated into the country with native
 dissidents and conscripts, in a manner
 which conceals the foreign instigation of
 the insurgency, and which enables the
 Communists to pretend that it is merely
 a civil war.
 It is time that we nail the civil war
 lie for what it is. It is time that we rec-
 ognized it as a form of aggression as
 765-428-96923
 intolerable as open aggression across
 marked frontiers.
 Why did Ho Chi Minh decide to launch
 the current war for the liberation of
 South Vietnam?  The answer to this
 question is really very simple.
 After the Geneva agreement, it had
 been the expectation of the Communists
 that South Vietnam would collapse in
 administrative and political chaos be-
 fore many months had passed, and that
 it would fall into their hands like an
 overripe plum.  Indeed, when Ngo Dinh
 Diem took office as Premier after the
 surrender of North Vietnam to the Com-
 munists, 99 percent of the Western press
 viewed the situation in South Vietnam
 as hopeless and predicted an early take-
 over by the Communist guerrillas.
 Cut off from the mineral and indus-
 trial riches of the north; swamped by
 an influx of 1 million refugees; without
 an adequate army or administration of
 its own; with three major sects, each
 with private armies, openly challenging
 its authority-confronted with this com-
 bination of burdens and handicaps, it
 seemed that nothing could save the new
 born South Vietnamese Government.
 But then there took place something
 that has properly come to be called the
 Diem miracle; this term was used at
 different times by President Kennedy and
 Secretary McNamara prior to Diem's
 overthrow, which most people, I believe,
 now realize was a tragic mistake.
 Diem first of all moved to destroy the
 power of the infamous Binh Xyuen, a
 sect of river pirates who, under the
 French, were given a simultaneous mo-
 nopoly on the metropolitan police force
 of Saigon and on the thousands of opium
 dens and houses of prostitution and
 gambling that flourished there.
 So powerful was the Binh Xyuen and
 so weak were the Diem forces at the
 time that even the American Ambassa-
 dor urged Diem not to attack them.
 Diem, however, did attack them and
 drove them out of Saigon.

 is
 Having defeated the military sects
 and integrated them into the Armed
 Forces of the republic, Diem within a
 few years was able to resettle the 1 mil-
 lion refugees and to create a stable uni-
 fied state where none had previously ex-
 isted.
 I could not help feeling indignant over
 articles and publications dealing with
 North Vietnam which have underscored
 what the Communists have done for
 their people.  Among other things, they
 have stressed the fact that the Commu-
 nists have greatly expanded. their school
 system.  What these articles did not
 mention. was that from 1955 to 1963
 President Diem has doubled the number
 of students in elementary schools, while
 at the secondary school level the in-
 crease has been fivefold.
 The remarkable progress in the field
 of education was no exception.  The en-
 tire South Vietnamese society scored re-
 markable advances in every field of eco-
 nomic and social endeavor, so that in
 1963 South Vietnam for the first time
 had a sizable rice surplus for export.
 There were significant increases in all
 sectors of industry and agriculture, and
 a 20-percent rise in per capita income.
 Meanwhile, in North Vietnam, things
 were going from bad to worse.  As in
 every other Communist country the col-
 lectivization of the peasants resulted in
 a dramatic reduction of food output and
 in chronic food shortages throughout
 the country.  The resentment of the
 peasants was compounded by the brutal
 and indiscriminate punishment of hun-
 dreds of thousands of peasant farmers
 who were hailed before so-called people's
 courts and charged with being bourgeois
 elements or exploiting landlords.  Dur-
 ing the course of 1955 peasant revolts
 broke out in several areas.  There was
 even a revolt in Ho Chi Minh's own vil-
 lage. And there was some evidence that
 the troops sent to suppress these revolts
 sometimes sympathized with the peas-
 765-428-96923
 ants.  Shortages increased year by year.
 The people became increasingly apa-
 thetic.
 The contrast between the growing
 prosperity of the South and the growing
 misery in the North confronted the Viet-
 namese Communists with a challenge
 they could not tolerate.  That is why
 they decided that they had to put an
 end  to  freedom in  South  Vietnam.
 While they have scored some sensational
 victories in their war of subversion
 against the South Vietnamese Govern-
 ment, I think it important to point out
 that this war has gravely complicated
 the already serious internal difficulties
 of the North, so that in 1963, for exam-
 ple, the per capita output of rice in Com-
 munist North Vietnam was 20 percent
 lower than in 1960.
 And I also consider it important to
 understand the significance of the fact
 that 'the Vietcong insurgency was di-
 rected not against a government that
 had failed to improve the lot of its peo-
 ple but against a government which,
 over a short period of time, had scored
 some of the most dramatic economic and
 social advances recorded anywhere in
 Asia;
 ESCALATION: FACT AND FALLACY
 There has been a good deal of talk
 about the United States escalating the
 war in South Vietnam. Several Senators
 who spoke last week warned that if we
 escalate the war by means of air strikes
 against North Vietnam, the escalation
 may get out of hand and wind up as a war
 with Red China or perhaps even a world
 war.
 But it is not we who have escalated the
 war; it is the Communists. Peiping and
 Hanoi have been busy escalating the war
 in South Vietnam for several years now.
 They have sent in tens of thousands of
 soldiers of the North Vietnamese Army ;
 they have trained additional tens of thou-
 sands of dissident South Vietnamese;

 they have supplied them with massive
 quantities of equipment; and. they have
 stepped up the tempo of their attacks
 against the Vietnamese people.
 Now we are told that if we take any ac-
 tion against the territory of North Viet-
 nam, which has mounted and directed
 the entire attack on South Vietnam, it
 will entail the risk of world war.
 If the Communists are always to be
 permitted the privilege of escalating their
 attempts to take over new countries,
 while we shrink from retaliation for fear
 of further escalation, we might as well
 throw in the sponge now and tell the
 Communists the world is theirs for the
 taking.
 I find it difficult to conceive of Red
 China sending in her armies in response
 to air strikes against carefully selected
 military targets.  After all, if they did
 so, they would be risking retaliation
 against their highly vulnerable coastal
 cities, where most of Red China's indus-
 try is concentrated. They would be risk-
 ing setting back their economy 10 or 20
 years.
 Moreover, both the Chinese Commu-
 nists and the Hanoi Communists are
 aware that the massive introduction of
 Chinese troops would create serious pop-
 ular resentment because of the tradi-
 tional Vietnamese suspicion of Chinese
 imperialism.
 That there will be no invasion of the
 North by Vietnamese and American
 forces can, I believe, be taken as axio-
 matic. Nor do I believe there will be any
 large-scale  involvement  of  American
 troops on the Korean model.  We will
 have to continue to provide the Viet-
 namese with logistical support and air
 support, as we are doing now. But on
 the ground, the fighting can most effec-
 tively be done by the Vietnamese armed
 forces, supported, I believe, by military
 contingents from the other free Asian
 countries.

 THE FALLACY THAT THE ASIAN PEOPLES DO NOT
 KNOW THE MEANING OF FREEDOM
 It has been stated by the senior Sena-
 tor from Idaho CMr. CHURCH]  and by
 other critics of our foreign policy in Viet-
 nam that it is pointless to talk about
 fighting for freedom in Asia because the
 Asian people historically do not know the
 meaning of freedom.  It has even been
 implied that, because of their ignorance
 of freedom and their indifference to it,
 communism exercises a genuine attrac-
 tion for the peoples of Asia.
 I am sure that most Asians would con-
 sider this analysis condescending and
 offensive. I myself would be disposed to
 agree with them. It is an analysis which,
 in my opinion, is false on almost every
 score.
 We have grown accustomed to equat-
 ing freedom with the full range of free-
 doms that we in the United States today
 enjoy.  But, in the world in which we
 line, the word "freedom" has at least
 three separate and perhaps equally im-
 portant connotations.
 First, there is national freedom, or in-
 dependence from foreign control.
 Second, there is freedom of speech
 and press and the other freedoms in-
 herent in parliamentary democracy, such
 as we enjoy.
 And, third, there is the type of natural
 freedom that is enjoyed by primitive
 peasants and tribesmen in many back-
 ward countries, even under political
 autocracies.
 It is true that most Asian governments
 are autocratic; and it is probably true
 that the Vietnamese people do not un-
 derstand or appreciate freedom in the
 sense of parliamentary democracy.  But
 they certainly understand the meaning
 of "freedom" when the word is used to
 mean independence from foreign rule.
 They are, in fact, a people with a long
 and proud history and a strong sense of
 national  identity.  Every  Vietnamese

 schoolboy knows that his people fought
 and  triumphed  over the hordes  of
 Genghis Khan in defense of their free-
 dom; and he also knows that his country
 was free for five centuries before the
 French occupation.  Finally, he knows
 and takes pride in the fact that his peo-
 ple drove out the French colonialists de-
 spite their army of 400,000 men.  Do not
 tell me that these people know nothing
 about freedom.
 To the westernized Saigonese intellec-
 tuals, freedom of speech and freedom of
 the press are certainly very real issues;
 and even though they may have not mas-
 tered the processes, they would unques-
 tionably like to see some kind of parlia-
 mentary democracy in their country.  It
 is completely understandable that they
 should have chafed over the political con-
 trols that existed under the Diem gov-
 ernment, and that have existed, in one
 degree or another, under succeeding gov-
 ernments.
 But in the countryside, where the great
 mass of the people reside, the political
 controls that exist in the city are mean-
 ingless.  The peasant is free to own his
 own land, to dispose of his produce, to
 worship according to his beliefs, to. guide
 the upbringing of his children, and to
 elect his local village officials.  To him,
 these freedoms that touch on his every-
 day life are the freedoms that really
 count, not the abstract and remote free-
 doms of constitutional and federal gov-
 ernment.
 And, if on top of granting him these
 natural freedoms, the government as-
 sists him by building schools and dis-
 pensaries and by providing seed and fer-
 tilizer, then, from the standpoint of the
 southeast Asian peasant, his life is full
 and he is prepared to fight to defend it
 against the Communists.
 It is, in short, completely untrue that
 the Vietnamese people and the other
 peoples of Asia do not know the mean-
 ing of freedom. And it is equally untrue
 766-428-96928
 that communism is acceptable to the
 Asian peasant because of his indiffer-
 ence to freedom.
 Communism has never been freely ac-
 cepted by any people, anywhere, no mat-
 ter how primitive.
 It has never been accepted for the
 simple reason that even primitive peoples
 do not enjoy being pushed around and
 brutalized and terrorized, and told what
 to do and what not to do, and having
 their every activity ordered and super-
 vised by political commissars.
 This is why communism must govern
 by means of ruthless dictatorship wher
 ever it takes power.
 This is why the primitive mountain
 peoples of both Laos and Vietnam have,
 in   an  overwhelming  majority,  sided
 against the Communists.
 This is why there are almost 8 mil-
 lion refugees from Communist rule in
 Asia today-people who have seen the
 reality of the so-called People's Democ-
 racy, and who have given up everything
 they possessed and frequently risked
 their lives to escape from it.
 That is why there is barbed wire and
 iron curtains surrounding the Commu-
 nist countries.  The inhabitants of the
 Communist countries would all leave if
 they could.
 There is one final comment I would like
 to make while dealing with this sub-
 ject.                                                                    Too often I have heard it said
 that the Vietnamese people are not fight-
 ing because there is nothing to choose
 between communism and the kind of gov-
 ernment they now have.
 To equate an authoritarian regime like
 that in South Vietnam, or Taiwan, or
 Thailand with the totalitarian rule of
 communism is tantamount to losing all
 sense of proportion.  Not only have these
 regimes never been guilty of the massive
 bloodletting and total direction of per-
 sonal life which has characterized Com-
 munist rule in every country, but, care-
 fully examined, it will turn out that these

 21
 regimes are a mixture of natural democ-
 racy at the bottom with political controls
 of varying rigidity at the top.
 Even at their worst, the political au-
 tocracies that exist in certain free Asian
 countries are a thousand times better
 than communism from the standpoint of
 how they treat their own people.  And
 at their best, some of these autocracies
 have combined control of the press and
 political parties with remarkably pro-
 gressive social programs.
 But perhaps more important from our
 standpoint is that these free autocracies,
 for lack of a better term, do not threaten
 the peace of their neighbors or of the
 world or threaten our own security,
 whereas world communism has now be-
 come a threat of terrifying dimensions.
 THE FALLACY THAT THE VIETNAMESE PEOPLE
 HAVE NO WILL TO RESIST COMMUNISM
 We have been told that the Vietnamese
 people are indifferent to communism;
 that they resist it only halfheartedly.
 Some commentators have even sought to
 create the impression that America is in
 a position of coercing the South Viet-
 namese to fight against communism.
 This estimate of the attitude of the
 South Vietnamese people is totally false.
 True, South Vietnam is suffering from
 political instability.
 True, the war against the Vietcong is
 going badly.
 But these things by themselves do not
 constitute proof that the Vietnamese
 people are indifferent to communism or
 that they do not have the will to resist.
 The people of South Vietnam are, in
 fact, one of the most anti-Communist
 peoples in the world.  Among them are
 more than 1 million refugees who sacri-
 ficed everything they possessed to flee
 from North Vietnam to South Vietnam
 after the country was divided by the
 Geneva agreement of 1954; and it is esti-
 mated that there are another 300,000 in-
 ternal refugees who have fled from Com-
 munist-controlled areas in the south.
 765-428-96923
 Among the present population of 14 mil-
 lion, in addition, there are several million
 peasants and workers and students who.
 have at one time or another borne arms
 against the Communists, some of them
 in the Vietnamese Army, the majority in
 village self-defense units.
 The overwhelming majority of the.
 people of South Vietnam know what com-
 munism means because they have experi-
 enced it on their own backs.  There are
 indeed very few South Vietnamese who
 do not have friends or relatives who have
 been the victims of Communist brutality
 and terror.
 Let me tell the story of one such act
 of Communist terror, because statistics
 by themselves tend to be meaningless.
 In the village of Phu Hoa, there was a
 teenage girl by the name of Giau, the
 pride of her parents and a born leader of
 others. As a member of the Republican
 Youth Organization, she organized the
 village youth and gave talks.  On the
 evening of January 15, 1962, she was ab-
 ducted from her village by Vietcong sol-
 diers.  The next morning her mutilated
 and decapitated body-I have a photo-
 graph of it-was discovered in the road-
 way outside the village with a note on
 her breast captioned "Death Sentence
 for Giau," and signed by the "People's
 Front of Liberation."
 For a long period of time, assassina-
 tions such as this were going on at the
 rate of some 500 a month, or 6,000 a
 year.  The victims were most frequently
 active supporters of government, local
 administrators, village heads, and school-
 teachers.  The families of village mili-
 tiamen were another favorite target.
 The Vietcong would entice the militia
 away from the village-and when they
 returned they would find their wives and
 children massacred.
 While the facts of these mass assassi-
 nations are not generally known in our
 country, they are known in Vietnam.
 And this is one of the reasons why the

 Vietnamese people hate the Communists,
 and why they continue to resist them
 despite the chronic political instability
 in Saigon and despite the seeming hope-
 lessness of their situation.
 For some strange reason, the torture
 of one Vietcong prisoner aroused far
 more indignation in our country than
 the assassination of scores of thousands
 of innocent civilians by the Vietcong
 Communists, including the bombing of a
 schoolbus in which a score of children
 died.
 But, if the Vietnamese people are anti-
 Communist, I have been asked: Why has
 the Vietnamese Army put up so poor a
 show?
 The Vietnamese Army has been handi-
 capped by political instability by the fre-
 quent shifts of officers, by poor staff
 work, by its inadequate use of scouts and
 security patrols, and by the many dis-
 advantages under which counterguer-
 rilla forces must always operate.  But,
 it is simply not true that the Vietnamese
 Army has shown no willingness to fight.
 They have fought bravely in thou-
 sands of engagements.  They have taken
 heavy casualties  and inflicted much
 heavier casualties on the enemy.
 The belief that the Vietnamese people
 do not have the will to resist the Com-
 munists and that the Vietnamese forces
 have fought poorly against them, is in
 large measure due to the unfortunate
 emphasis which the press always places
 on disasters and defects.
 It probably also springs in part from
 the traditional attitude of the American
 newspaperman that it is his duty to
 mercilessly expose every weakness in
 his city government, in his State govern-
 ment, in his National Government.
 I do not complain about that. I sup-
 pose that is the way it has to be.
 But whatever the reasons may be, the
 emphasis in the press has been so mis-
 leading that even knowledgeable mem-
 bers of the administration have been con-
 765--428-96923
 fused by it.  For example, a member of
 the administration who very recently
 visited Vietnam informed me that, con-
 trary to his impressions from reading the
 press he was amazed to learn that in
 eight engagements of battalion size and
 larger which took place  during  the
 month of January 1965, the Vietnamese
 Army got the better of the engagement
 in every single case.
 I have here the comparative figures
 for Vietnamese and Vietcong casualties
 for the 3-year period 1962-64, which
 I have received from an official source.
 I wish to read them, Mr. President, be-
 cause they throw an altogether new light
 on the situation in Vietnam.  I do not
 know why these figures were not released
 long ago.  I hear people complaining
 that they do not know what is going on
 in Vietnam. The release of these figures
 would have helped them to understand.
 In 1962 the Vietnamese Army lost 4,400
 killed in action against 21,000 Vietcong
 killed, and 1,300 prisoners against 5,500
 captives taken from the Vietcong.
 Those are pretty good statistics. They
 ought to be read and studied by those
 who have been telling us that the South
 Vietnamese have no will to fight.
 Listen to these further figures:
 In 1963 the figures were 5,700 Vietna-
 mese soldiers killed in action against
 21,000 Vietcong, and 3,300 missing or
 captured against 4,000 Vietcong cap-
 tured.
 And even last year, when the fortunes
 of war turned against the Vietnamese
 government, the Vietnamese Army killed
 17,000 Vietcong against a loss of 7,000
 men, and took 4,200 Communists captive
 against 5,800 captives lost to them.
 To those who say that the Vietnamese
 Army has not shown the will to resist,
 I point out that, over the 3-year period
 for which I have presented figures, this
 army suffered a total death toll of 17,000
 men, which is almost as high as the total
 American toll in South Korea.  The

 .23
 enemy's casualties have been much heav-
 ier. But the Communists have continued
 to attack regardless of losses.  And be-
 cause it has not been possible to recon-
 stitute a stable government since the
 overthrow.of Diem, and, because no one
 knows where guerrillas may strike next,
 and because unlimited terror is a dread-
 fully effective instrument, the Vietcong,
 over the past 15 months, have been able
 to make most of the Vietnamese country-
 side insecure.
 The fact that the Vietcong seem to be
 winning and that they have been so
 effective in resisting government count-
 erattacks, has led some people to believe
 that the Vietcong soldier is convinced of
 the justice of his cause and that this is
 why he fights more grimly.
 The Communists are masters of the
 art of imposing iron discipline by means
 of unlimited terror.
 Senators will recall that during the
 Korean war we all marveled at the dis-
 cipline of the Chinese Communist sol-
 diers who kept on marching without
 breaking step while they were being
 bombed and strafed by American planes,
 or who attacked our positions, wave upon
 wave, apparently oblivious to casualties.
 I remember people saying, "See the
 dedication of these Chinese Communists.
 See how they bear themselves against
 bullets and bombs. See how fanatically
 they believe in their cause."  I did not
 think that was the reason, but I did not
 have an effective answer until after the
 war was over.
 Senators will recall the terrible riots
 in the Koje prisoner-of-war camp, when
 the prisoners seemed so grimly united
 against us that for weeks on end Amer-
 ican soldiers could not venture into the
 POW compound.  Again, the common
 assumption was that the prisoners were
 all fanatical Communists.
 But then the end of the war came-
 and it turned out that 20,000 out of 25,000
 of the Communist prisoners in our hands
 765-428-96923
 asked for refugee status rather than
 return to North Korea or China.  And
 these were supposed to be the dedicated
 Communists who believe so fanatically
 in communism.
 Of the 5,000 who returned home, there
 is reason to believe that the majority
 did so with heavy hearts, because of
 strong family ties and not because of
 any love for communism.
 I remind the Senators-because these
 things tend to be forgotten-of the evi-
 dence which emerged that the Koje pris-
 oners of war had been terrorized by a
 tiny minority of Communist militants
 who ran the camp with an iron hand,
 torturing political opponents,  staging
 kangaroo courts, and executing and
 burying those who were sentenced.
 I also remind them of the scenes that
 took place when the prisoners were
 brought before the Communist interro-
 gators under the procedures set up by
 the Neutral Nations Repatriation Com-
 mission. The prisoners had to be dragged
 before the interrogators forcibly, their
 arms pinned behind their backs by In-
 dian soldiers. When the Communist in-
 terrogators spoke to them, urging that
 they return to their homeland, the pris-
 oners spat out their hatred with a vehe-
 mence that Western observers found
 frightening.  So embarrassing were the
 interrogations for the Communists that
 after a number of sessions they decided
 to call off the whole show.
 In the light of this conclusion, how
 much significance can one attach to the
 seemingly fanatical courage displayed by
 the Chinese and North Korean soldiers
 in attacking our positions, or to the grim
 unity of the Koje prisoners of war in
 resisting their American captors?
 Before we marvel at the apparently
 high morale of the Vietcong forces in
 South Vietnam, I suggest that we recall
 the experience of the Korean war, be-
 cause the evidence is overwhelming that
 the Vietcong Communists are using ter-

 Approved For Release 2003/12/02 : CIA-RDP75-00149R000200310041-4
 24
 ror on the same scale and in the same
 manner that it was employed on the
 Korean battlefront and in the prisoner-
 of-war camps.
 That the morale of the Vietcong forces
 is not 10 feet tall is demonstrated by the
 substantial number of Vietcong prisoners
 taken over the past 3 years. It is demon-
 strated even more dramatically by the
 fact that from February 1963 through
 the end of 1964 there were approxi-
 mately 17,000 Vietcong defections.  The
 number of  defections. would  be far
 larger, I am certain, if a stable govern-
 ment could establish itself in Saigon.
 It is interesting to note that, while
 most of the defectors have been young
 peasants who were conscripted by the
 Vietcong, their ranks also include North
 Vietnamese officers who were told that
 they were going south to fight the Amer-
 icans and who broke when they dis-
 covered that they were fighting their
 own people.
 Impatient constituents have sometimes
 asked me why the Communists have been
 able to plan elaborate attacks on our
 airfields and other installations without
 advance intelligence reaching us from
 members of the local population who
 must have observed the Communists.
 The instrument of terror is also appli-
 cable to the control of the civilian popu-
 lation.  Whenever the Communists take
 over a village or a town, they systemat-
 ically massacre all known anti-Commu-
 nist leaders and those who are suspected
 of informing.  They frequently mutilate
 their bodies as an example to the people.
 If we could give the Vietnamese vil-
 lagers a feeling of greater security, I am
 sure that more intelligence would, be
 forthcoming.   As matters now stand, the
 average Vietnamese peasant fears that
 the Communists are going to win the
 war, and he knows the terrible punish-
 ment that awaits those who inform on
 the Communists.  This is why our in-
 telligence has admittedly been inade- .
 766-428--96923
 quate-one of the reasons, certainly.
 But this is a situation that could change
 dramatically if we succeeded in convinc-
 ing the Vietnamese people of our deter-
 mination to help them retain their free-
 dom, and if we succeeded in inflicting a
 number of significant defeats on the
 enemy.
 THE BUDDHIST FALLACY
 I now wish to discuss the Buddhist sit-
 uation, about which we have heard so
 much over the several years.
 The myth of Buddhist persecution and
 the parallel myth that the Buddhists are
 opposed to the Government, have be-
 cause of the so-called militant Buddhist
 movement, become important political
 factors in Vietnam. It is, therefore, im-
 portant that we should seek to under-
 stand the nature of this movement, the
 motivation of its leaders, and the real
 degree of influence it exerts over the
 Vietnamese people.
 The campaign which resulted in the
 overthrow of President Diem was marked
 by the charge that he had subjected the
 Buddhist religion to inhuman persecu-
 tion; and, in protest against this alleged
 persecution, a number of Buddhist monks
 went through the horrifying ritual of
 self-immolation.
 Week after week, month after month,
 the American people and the people of
 the world were inundated with stories
 supporting the charge that Diem was
 persecuting the Buddhist religion. There
 were a number of experienced corre-
 spondents of national reputation who
 challenged the authenticity  of these
 stories.  But their voices were drowned
 by the torrent of charges and allegations
 that appeared in some of our major news-
 papers,                                                                     and  that  were  lent  further
 credence because of repetition of our of-
 fical information agencies.
 At the invitation of President Diem, the
 U.N. General Assembly decided to send a
 factfinding mission to South Vietnam to

 Approved For Release 2003/12/02 : CIA-RDP75-00149R000200310041-4
 25
 look into the situation. I find this rarely
 referred to in any discussion of the Bud-
 dhist question, but it is a fact that the
 United Nations did send a mission over
 there.
 . While the mission was still in the coun-
 try, President Diem and his brother,
 Ngo Dinh Nhu, were overthrown and
 assassinated.
 The mission decided that the overthrow
 of Diem made it unnecessary to come up
 with a formal finding.  I believe that
 this was most regrettable. But the sum-
 mary of the testimony which it had taken
 in Vietnam pointed strongly to the con-
 clusion that the  persecution of the
 Buddhists was either nonexistent or
 vastly exaggerated and that the agita-
 tion was essentially political.  This, in
 essence, was what I was told in a per-
 sonal conversation with Ambassador Fer-
 mando Volio Jiminez, of Costa Rica, who
 had introduced the motion calling for the
 setting up of the U.N. mission and who
 served as a member of it.
 I went to New York and saw Ambas-
 sador Volio.  I said, "Mr. Ambassador, I
 understand you were a member of the
 United Nations commission which went
 to Vietnam. I should like to ask you
 what the facts are."  Ambassador Volio
 gave me the facts as I have given them to
 you here.
 Ambassador Pinto, of Dahomey, an-
 other member of the U.N. mission, ex-
 pressed himself in similar terms  in
 public.
 The entire tragic story suggests that
 the free world was made the victim of a
 gigantic propaganda hoax, as a result of
 which the legitimate  government of
 President Diem was destroyed and a
 chaotic situation created which has in-
 evitably played into the hands of the
 Communists.
 If Senators have not yet had time to
 read the report of the U.N.factflnding
 mission to Vietnam, I urge them to do so
 because it throws essential light on the
 765-428-96923
 current  activities  of  the  militant
 Buddhists. I am arranging to have copies
 mailed to every Senator, and I hope that
 all Senators will read it, because they
 will learn a great deal about the present
 Buddhist situation from it.
 The first fact which needs to be estab-
 lished in evaluating the militant Buddhist
 movement is that the Buddhists do not
 constitute 80 or 85 percent of the popula-
 tion, as was widely reported at the time
 of the Buddhist crisis. According to Dr.
 Mai Tho Truyen, one of the greatest au-
 thorities on Vietnam Buddhism, the Viet-
 namese Buddhists number approximately
 4 million people, or about 30 percent of
 the population.
 The second point that must be made is
 that the militant Buddhists constitute
 only a small fraction of the total Bud-
 dhist population.  The millions of the
 Buddhist peasants, in their great ma-
 jority, do not approve of the militant
 political actions and the government-
 toppling intrigues of the Buddhist mili-
 tants in Saigon. Their activities, indeed,
 run completely counter to the pacific
 traditions of the Buddhist religion.
 It is questionable whether the Bud-
 dhist militants have been able to mobilize
 as many as 50,000 active supporters in
 all the demonstrations they have staged
 in Saigon and Hue and other cities. But
 because political power resides in the
 cities, the several tens of thousands of
 Buddhist militants, by their clamor and
 their persistent demonstrations and their
 clever propaganda, have succeeded in
 creating the impression that they speak
 for the people of the cities and for the
 majority of the people of Vietnam.
 What do the Buddhist militants want?
 Before the overthrow of President Diem,
 Thich Tri Quang told Marguerite Hig-
 gins frankly: "We cannot get an arrange-
 ment with the north until we get rid of
 Diem and Nhu."
 The evidence is clear that Thich Tri
 Quang and some of his other militants
 Approved For Release 2003/12/02 : CIA-RDP75-00149R000200310041-4
 Approved For Release 2003/12/02 : CIA-RDP75-00149R000200310041-4
 26
 are still bent on an agreement with the
 north.  Indeed, only last Friday, Quang
 called for U.S. negotiations with Ho Chi
 Minh.
 If there is reason to believe that Thich
 Tri. Quang is a neutralist, there is even
 more reason for fearing that some of the
 other members of the Buddhist opposi-
 tion movement are openly pro-Commu-
 nist or that they have become tools of
 the rather substantial Communist infil-
 tration which is known to exist in the
 Buddhist clergy in the various countries
 of Asia.
 That such an infiltration should exist
 is not surprising because there are no
 barriers to it.
 A man who wants to become a Bud-
 dhist monk does not have to prepare him-
 self for his ministry by engaging in
 studies, nor does he have to be ordained,
 nor does he take any vow.
 He simply shaves his head and dons
 the saffron robe and enters a monas-
 tery-and overnight he becomes one of
 the religious elite.
 When he wishes to leave the mon-
 astery, he sheds his robe and leaves it;
 if he wishes to reenter, he dons his robe
 again and reenters.  That is all there
 is to it.
 I do not criticize this procedure on
 religious grounds.
 Buddhism is one of the great religions
 of mankind and much can be said for
 an arrangement that enables every man
 of religious disposition to spend at least
 a portion of his life under the voluntary
 monastic  discipline  characteristic  of
 Buddhism.
 But, regrettably, it is a procedure that
 leaves the door wide open to Communist
 infiltration.
 I remember that when we were digging
 into the files of the Nazis at Nuremberg,
 we found that Hitler had under consider-
 ation a program of infiltrating the
 churches by inducing young people to
 enter seminaries, so that he could have
 them at his disposal.
 76&4-28---96923
 When I first began to hear of the
 Buddhist situation, it occurred to me
 that more than likely there was a sim-
 ilar infiltration of religion at work.
 The militant Buddhists have used the
 influence and prestige which accrued to
 them from the overthrow of Diem for
 the prime purpose of making stable gov-
 ernment impossible: in this sense, what-
 ever the intent of their leaders, they
 have been serving the desires of the
 Communist Vietcong.
 They have organized demonstrations,
 provoked riots, inflamed passions with
 highly publicized fasts and self-immola-
 tions, and subjected the government to
 a ceaseless propaganda barrage.  They
 overthrew  the  Khanh     government.
 Then they overthrew the Huong govern-
 anent which succeeded it.  And they
 !seem to be intent on making things im-
 possible for any government that may
 'come to power.
 It is, of course, difficult to deal with a
 political conspiracy that camouflages it-
 self in religious robes.  In any case, this
 is a matter for the Vietnamese Govern-
 ment and not for our own Government.
 But it would make matters immeasur-
 ably easier for the Vietnamese authori-
 ties if the true facts about Buddhism
 in Vietnam, were given. to the American
 people and if they could be helped to
 understand how little the Buddhist mili-
 tants really represent, how nefarious
 their political activities have really been,
 and how much they have done, to under-
 mine the fight against Communists.
 No stable government can be created
 in Vietnam without the participation and
 support of responsible Buddhist leader-
 ship.  But this responsible leadership
 cannot be found among the handful of
 monks of questionable antecedents who
 have been misdirecting  the militant
 Buddhist movement in the cities of Viet-
 nam.
 It is time to speak bluntly on this issue.

 THE FALLACY OF THE FRENCH ANALOGY
 Over and over again in recent months
 I have heard it said that our position in
 Vietnam  is  impossible  because  the
 French, who knew Vietnam so much bet-
 ter than we do, were compelled to admit
 defeat after 8 years of war against the
 Vietminh. A recent half-page adver-
 tisement in the New York Times asked:
 "How can we win in Vietnam with less
 than 30,000 advisers, when the French
 could not win with an army of nearly
 half a million?"
 Our own position is entirely different
 from the French position in Indochina.
 The French were a colonial power, ex-
 ploiting and imposing their will on the
 Indochinese people and stubbornly deny-
 ing them their freedom.  The French
 military effort in Indochina was doomed
 because it had against it not only the
 Communists  but  the  overwhelming
 majority of the Indochinese people. It
 was a war fought by Frenchmen against
 Indochinese.
 The United States, however, does not
 seek to impose its control on Vietnam or
 exploit Vietnam.  We are not a colonial
 power.  We seek only to help the people
 of South Vietnam defend their freedom
 against an insurgency that is inspired
 and directed and aided by the North Viet-
 namese Communists. This is understood
 by the Vietnamese people.  And that is
 why hundreds of thousands of Vietnam-
 ese who fought with Ho Chi Minh against
 the French are today fighting for the
 Saigon government against the Vietcong.
 That is why the war against the Viet-
 cong can be won, while the war of French
 colonialism against the Indochinese inde-
 pendence movement was doomed from
 the outset.
 There is no similarity in the two situa-
 tions that has any meaning or validity.
 WHAT CAN BE DONE?
 I believe the war in Vietnam can be
 won without a significant increase in our
 military effort.  There are many things
 765-428-96923
 that can be done to improve the perform-'
 ance of our side, and most of them lie
 essentially in the nonmilitary field.
 Let me set forth some of the things
 that I believe can be done.
 THE NEED FOR IMPROVED LIAISON
 One of the most obvious and most seri-
 ous weaknesses of the American position
 in Vietnam is the lack of adequate liaison
 with the leaders of the various sectors of
 the Vietnamese community.
 Because of this lack of communication,
 we have frequently been caught un-
 awares by developments; we have re-
 mained without serious ability to influ-
 ence them; and we have not been able to
 effectively assist the Vietnamese in com-
 municating with each other and in sta-
 bilizing the political situation in Saigon.
 No one person is to blame for this. It
 is, rather, the system which rotates mili-
 tary officers and AID officials and other
 Americans in Vietnam on an annual or
 2-year basis.
 As one American officer pointed out in
 a recent interview, "It takes about 8
 months before you can really get to know
 the country and the people.  And, just
 about the time you are beginning to
 understand something, you are rotated
 home and that is the end of your utility."
 I believe that something can be done to
 improve this situation.
 I have met a number of Americans,
 former soldiers and former AID officials,
 who have spent 5 years or more in Viet-
 nam, have built up personal friendships
 with leaders of every sector of the Viet-
 namese community, enjoy the confidence
 of the Vietnamese because of their
 understanding and dedication, and who
 would jump at the opportunity to return
 to Vietnam for the purpose of helping it
 in this critical hour.  I am told that
 there may be as many as 10 or 12 such
 people in this country.
 I have proposed in a letter to the
 President that these Americans be con-
 stituted into a liaison group and that

 28
 'they be dispatched to Saigon imme-
 diately for the purpose of helping the
 Embassy to establish the broadest and
 most effective possible liaison with the
 army leaders, with the Buddhists, with
 the intellectual community, and with the
 Vietnamese political leaders.
 I know that there is always a tendency
 on the part of World War II officers to
 resent World War I officers, and on the
 part of those who are involved in a situa-
 tion .today to resist the assistance of
 those who preceded them.  There is also
 sometimes a tendency for those who were
 there yesterday to believe that they
 understand things better than those who
 are there today.
 But this is a situation in which I am
 confident every American, no matter
 what his rank, will seek to rise above his
 personal prejudices. It is a situation that
 demands the utilization of every ounce
 of experience and dedication available
 to us.
 It is my earnest personal conviction
 that the dispatch of such a liaison group
 to Saigon would result in an early im-
 provement in our ability to communicate
 with the Vietnamese and in our ability to
 assist them in achieving the political sta-
 bility which is essential to the successful
 prosecution of the war.
 THE NEED FOR A STEPPED-VP POLITICAL WARFARE
 EFFORT
 From many conversations with Viet-
 namese and with Americans who have
 served in various capacities in Vietnam,
 I am convinced that another one of our
 major weaknesses lies in the field of po-
 litical warfare.
 We have, by and large, been trying to
 meet the Communist insurgency by tra-
 ditional military methods or by tradi-
 tional methods slightly tailored to meet
 the special requirements of guerrilla war-
 fare.  In the field of political warfare,
 where the Communists have scored their
 most spectacular triumphs, our own ef-
 fort has been limited, and halting, and
 766-428-96923
 amateurish, and, in fact, sadly ineffec-
 tive.
 The prime goal of political warfare, as
 it must be waged by freemen, is to win
 men's minds. The prime goal of political
 warfare, as it is waged by the Commu-
 nists, is to erode and paralyze the will to
 resist by means of total error.
 An effective. political warfare program
 requires three major ingredients: First,
 a handful of basic slogans which capsul-
 ize popular desires and which are capable
 of striking responsive chords in the
 hearts of the people; second, a propa-
 ganda apparatus capable of conveying
 this program both to those on the Gov-
 ernment side and those on the side of the
 insurgents; third, specially trained cad-
 res to direct the effort.
 Bud the slogans we have are inade-
 quate.  Our propaganda program is dis-
 mally weak compared with that of the
 Communists.  And according to my in-
 formation, we still have not assisted the
 Vietnamese to set up an intensive train-
 ing program in Communist cold war
 methods and how to counter them.
 An article in the New York Times on
 August 3, 1964, pointed out that in every
 area "the basic cutting tool of the Viet-
 cong is a squad of about 10 armed men
 and women whose primary function is
 propaganda."  The article also said that
 "Most of the experts in psychological
 warfare and propaganda here believe the
 Vietcong's agitprop teams have done the
 Saigon government more damage than
 even the tough Vietcong regular batta-
 lions."  Finally, the article made the
 point that according to estimates there
 were 320  Vietcong  "agitprop"  teams
 working in the country, against 20 "in-
 formation teams" for the government
 side. This gave the Vietcong an edge of
 16 to l in the field of propaganda per-
 sonnel. And the edge was probably even
 greater in terms of finesse and effective-
 ness.

 Even if we. help the South Vietnamese
 Government intensify its propaganda ef-
 fort, there would still remain the prob-
 lem of basic goals and slogans.
 I have pointed out that the Vietnamese
 people have a proud history and a strong
 sense of national unity. All Vietnamese,
 whether they live in the north or south,
 would like to see a unified and peaceful
 Vietnam. But as matters now stand, only
 the Communists are able to hold forth
 the prospect of the reunification of Viet-
 nam.                               To date we have not given the
 South Vietnamese Government the green
 light to set up a "Committee for the
 Liberation of North Vietnam," as coun-
 terpart to the "Liberation Front" which
 the Communists have set up in the south.
 This places the South Vietnamese side
 at a grave disadvantage.
 There are any number of patriotic
 North Vietnamese refugees who have
 been itching for the opportunity to set
 up a Liberation Committee for the North.
 The establishment of such a committee
 could, in my opinion, have an immediate
 and profound impact on the conduct of
 the war.
 But above all, the situation in Vietnam
 underscores the need for an effective
 training program in political warfare,
 for our own foreign service and military
 personnel so that they can help to com-
 municate this knowledge to nationals of
 other countries who, like the South Viet-
 namese, are engaged in a life-and-death
 struggle for survival against the most
 cunning and most ruthless practitioners
 of political warfare history has ever
 known.
 In this connection, I wish to bring
 to the attention of my colleagues the
 fact that there has been pending before
 Congress for some 6 years a bill calling
 for the establishment of a Freedom
 Academy.  This would be an institu-
 tion where Americans and citizens of
 other free countries could receive con-
 centrated training in Communist tech-
 765-428-96923
 niques and operations, and in tactics and
 methods designed to frustrate the Com-
 munists at every operational level, from
 elections for the control of trade unions
 and student organizations, to street riots,
 to attempted insurrections.
 The Senate Judiciary Committee in
 reporting this measure to the floor in
 May of 1960, described the bill as "one
 of the most important measures ever In-
 troduced in the Congress."  But, unfor-
 tunately, although the bill was passed
 by the Senate, the House took no action.
 When the bill was reintroduced for the
 third time in early 1963, it has the spon-
 sorship  of  the  following  Senators :
 MUNDT, DOUGLAS, CASE, DODD, SMATHERS,
 Goldwater, PROXMIRE,  FONG,  HIcKEN-
 LOOPER, MILLER, Keating, LAUSCHE, and
 SCOTT.
 The distinguished senior Senator from
 South Dakota last Friday reintroduced
 the measure for the fourth time, and it is
 now lying on the table, so that those who
 wish to add their names as cosponsors
 may do so.  It is my earnest hope that
 the measure will have the sponsorship
 of an even larger bipartisan group of
 Senators than it did in 1963.  It is my
 hope too that there will be no further
 delay, no foot dragging, in enacting this
 long-overdue measure.  It is time, high
 time, that we recognize the imperative
 need to equip ourselves and our allies
 with the knowledge and the trained per-
 sonnel required to meet the Communist
 onslaught.
 CARRYING THE GUERRILLA WAR TO THE NORTH
 First of all, I think there is a growing
 acceptance of the need for punishing the
 North with hit-and-run raids. It would
 be much more effective if these raids
 could be carried out in the name of a
 North Vietnamese Liberation Front than
 in the name of the South Vietnamese
 Government.
 Second, I have reason for believing
 that increasing consideration is being
 given to the need for countering the Viet-

 Approved For Release 2003/12/020: CIA-RDP75-00149R000200310041-4
 tong insurgency in the South with a
 guerrilla warfare effort in the North.
 In May of 1961, when I returned from
 Laos and Vietnam, I made a statement,
 which I should like to repeat today:
 The best way for us to stop Communist
 guerrilla action in Laos and in South Viet-
 nam is to send guerrilla forces into North
 Vietnam; to equip and supply those patriots
 already in the field; to make every Commu-
 nist official fear the just retribution of an
 outraged humanity; to make every Commu-
 nist arsenal, government building, commu-
 nications center and transportation facility
 a target for sabotage; to provide a rallying
 point for the great masses of oppressed peo-
 ple who hate communism because they have
 known it.  Only when we give the Commu-
 nists more trouble than they can handle at
 home, will they cease their aggression against
 the outposts of freedom.
 I believe that every word I said in 1961
 Is doubly valid today. It is not too late to
 embark upon such a program. And if we
 do give the South Vietnamese Govern-
 ment the green light to embark upon it
 on an effective, hard-hitting scale, again
 I think it would add significantly to the
 psychological impact of the entire pro-
 gram if all guerrilla activities were car-
 ried out in the name of the "Committee
 for the Liberation of the North."
 A FEW MILITARY SUGGESTIONS
 I do not pretend to be a military ex-
 pert. But I have discussed the situation
 in Vietnam with a number of military
 men of considerable experience in the
 area, and I have been encouraged to be-
 lieve that the several suggestions which
 I have to make in this field are realistic.
 I submit them for the consideration
 of my colleagues, because I think they
 make sense.
 My first proposition is that we cannot
 regard the war in Vietnam in isolation
 from the rest of southeast Asia.
 The Communist Party over which Ho
 Chi Minh presided for many years was
 the Communist Party of Indochina. In-
 deed, to this day, there is no such thing
 765-428--96923
 as a Communist Party in Vietnam. Ho
 Chi Minh's thinking and strategy are
 directed toward the reunification of all
 the former territories of French Indo-
 china under his personal sway.  This
 makes it imperative for us to develop a
 coordinated strategy for the entire area
 if we are to cope effectively with the
 Communist strategy.
 Proposition No. 2 is that there are
 certain dramatic military actions open
 to us that do not involve the territory of
 North Vietnam.
 The hub of the Ho Chi Minh trail is
 the town of Tchepone, inside the Lao-
 tian frontier, just south of the 17th par-
 allel, the dividing line between North
 Vietnam and South Vietnam.  Through
 Tchepone pour most of the reinforce-
 ments and equipment from North Viet-
 nam.  From Tchepone the men and
 equipment are infiltrated into South
 Vietnam along hundreds of different
 jungle trails.
 I recall that when I met with Presi-
 dent Diem in April of 1961, he urged that
 the Americans assist him and the Laotian
 Government in preemptive action to
 secure three key centers in the Laotian
 Panhandle-Tchepone,  Saravane,  and
 Attopeu-in order to prevent the large-
 scale infiltration which is today taking
 place. I still have a copy of the marked
 map which he gave me in outlining his
 project.  Had Diem's advice been fol-
 lowed there would have been no Ho Chi
 Minh trail.  But this was at the time of
 the Laotian armistice and we were not
 disposed to take any actions which might
 provoke the Laotian Communists.  So
 nothing was done.
 The seizure of Tchepone by Laotian
 and Vietnamese forces, with American
 air support would, I have been. assured,
 be a feasible military operation and one
 that could be carried out with the means
 available to us on the spot.  It would
 do more to put a crimp in the Ho Chi
 Minh trail than any amount of bombing

 Approved For Release 2003/12/02 :,PIA-RDP75-00149R000200310041-4
 we could attempt.  And it would have
 as dramatic an impact on the situation
 in Laos as on the situation in Vietnam.
 Finally, there is the matter of collec-
 tive action by the SEATO nations.
 As late as April of 1961, the SEATO na-
 tions in the immediate area of the
 Philippines,  Thailand, Australia, New
 Zealand, and Pakistan-all favored com-
 mon  action                                      against  the  Communist
 menace in Laos. But the British and
 French were opposed to such action, and
 we ourselves sat on the fence; and the
 result was that nothing was done.
 The charter of SEATO will have to be
 modified so that one nation cannot veto
 collective action by all the other nations.
 Britain, I am inclined to believe, would
 now be disposed to support collective ac-
 tion by SEATO because of the situation
 in Malaysia. But, perhaps France should
 be invited to leave SEATO, on the
 grounds that she has no vital interests in
 the area, and her entire attitude toward
 Red China is one of appeasement.  In
 view of the fact thpt something has to be
 done immediately, however, the sensible
 course is to encourage collective action
 by the free nations in the area, outside
 the framework of SEATO, until SEATO
 can be reorganized in a manner that
 makes it effective.
 In this connection, I am most encour-
 aged by the news that South Korea has
 decided to send a contingent of several
 thousand military engineers to South
 Vietnam, and the Philippines have de-
 cided to do likewise.  It is infinitely bet-
 ter from every standpoint to have Asian
 troops supporting the Vietnamese forces
 against the Vietcong on the ground, than
 it is to have American troops actively in-
 volved.
 THE NEED FOR UNDERSCORING OUR
 LONG-TERM COMMITMENT
 The retaliatory strikes ordered by
 President Johnson against the North
 have had the effect of reiterating our
 commitment in a manner that the Com-
 765-428-96923
 munists understand; and this, in the
 long run, is probably more important
 than the  damage wrought by these
 strikes.
 But if the Communists are to be dis-
 couraged from continuing this costly
 war, we must seek every possible means
 of underscoring our determination to
 stand by the people of South Vietnam,
 to pay whatever cost may be necessary,
 and to take whatever risk may be neces-
 sary to prevent the Communists from
 subjugating the Vietnamese people and
 other peoples in the area.
 It is important to reiterate our resolve
 at every opportunity.  And it is even
 more important to translate this resolve
 into hard political and military actions.
 The American Friends of Vietnam
 have suggested another dramatic meas-
 ure.  They have suggested a commit-
 ment to a massive southeast Asian de-
 velopment program based on the har-
 nessing of the Mekong River-a kind of
 Tennessee Valley Authority for south-
 east Asia.  Such a plan, they point out,
 would offer incredible promise to Laos,
 Cambodia, and Thailand as well as to
 South Vietnam, and it would offer equal
 promise to the people of North Vietnam,
 which only the continued belligerence
 and noncooperation of their Government
 could frustrate.
 This, to me, sounds eminently sensi-
 ble.
 FOR A COMMITMENT TO VICTORY
 If we decide to withdraw from Viet-
 nam we can certainly find plenty of ex-
 cuses to ease our path.  We can blame it
 on the geography; or on the topography;
 or on local apathy; or on political in-
 stability; or on religious strife; or even
 on anti-Americanism. But that will fool
 no one but ourselves. These conditions
 make our success there difficult, but only
 our own timidity and vacillation can
 make it impossible.
 It has become obvious that we cannot
 go on fighting this undeclared war under
 Approved For Release 2003/12/02 : CIA-RDP75-00149R000200310041-4
 Approved For Release 2003/12/032: CIA-RDP75-00149R000200310041-4
 the rules laid down by our enemies. We
 have reached the point where we shall
 have to make a great decision, a decision
 as to whether we are to take the hard
 steps necessary to turn the tide in Viet-
 nam or whether we are to refrain from
 doing so and thus lose inevitably by de-
 fault.
 The ultimate outcome of the cold war
 depends upon an affirmative decision to
 do whatever is necessary to achieve vic-
 tory in South Vietnam.  The events of
 recent weeks demonstrate again that the
 administration is not lacking in resolve
 and that it is rapidly approaching such a
 decision.
 Whether that means a larger commit-
 ment of forces, or continued retaliatory
 strikes against the North, or carrying
 guerrilla warfare to the enemy home-
 land, or completely sealing off South
 Vietnam from Communist aid-I say to
 the administration, "Give us the plan
 that will do the job, and we will support
 you."
 Whether our victory be near or far, can
 we, dare we, turn away or begin to turn
 away from the task before us, however
 frustrating or burdensome it may be?
 Here surely is a time for us to heed
 Santayana's maxim "Those who will not
 learn from the past are destined to re-
 peat it."
 And so I speak today not merely to urge
 that we stand fast in Vietnam, but also
 to urge that we meet head on the new
 isolationism in its incipient stages, before
 the long months and years of discontent,
 frustration, and weariness that lie ahead
 have swelled the chorus urging disen-
 gagement and withdrawal to a deafening
 roar.
 Let us expound a foreign policy nur-
 tured in our constantly growing strength,
 not one fed by fear and disillusionment;
 a policy which each year is prepared to
 expend more, not less, in the cause of
 preserving our country and the decencies
 of man.
 765-428-96928
 Let, us insist upon a defense budget
 based upon the dangers we face abroad,
 not upon the benefits we seek at home.
 Let us embrace a doctrine that refuses
 to yield to force, ever; that honors its
 commitments because we know that our
 good faith is the cement binding the free
 world together; a doctrine that recog-
 nizes in its foreign aid program not only
 that the' rich are morally obligated to
 help the poor, but also that prosperity
 cannot permanently endure surrounded
 by poverty, and justice cannot conquer
 until its conquest is universal.
 Let us, above all, encourage and inspire
 a national spirit worthy of our history,
 worthy  of  our  burgeoning,  bursting
 strength, in our arms, in our agriculture,
 in industry, in science, in finance, a spirit
 of confidence, of optimism, of willingness
 to accept new risks and exploit new op-
 portunities.
 And let us remember that providence
 has showered upon our people greater
 blessings than on any other, and that,
 great though our works have been, much
 greater is expected of us.
 In recent days, the free world has paid
 tribute to its greatest champion of our
 age, Winston Churchill.
 It is a curious thing that though
 Churchill is acknowledged on all sides
 as the preeminent figure of our time
 and as the highest embodiment of West-
 ern statesmanship, he was, throughout
 his life, and remains today, a prophet
 unheeded, a statesman whom men ven-
 erate but will not emulate.
 It may well be that Winston Church-
 ill's greatest legacy will prove to be, not
 the legacy of his immortal deeds, but
 that of his example and his precepts; and
 that freemen of the future will pay him
 the homage denied by his contempo-
 raries, the tribute of imitation and ac-
 ceptance of his message.
 As we ponder the passing of this he-
 roic figure and reflect upon. his career
 and try to draw from it lessons which

 we might apply to the aggressive on-
 slaught that we face today in a hundred
 ways on a hundred fronts, we might
 take to heart this advice which he gave in
 the dark days of 1941 to the boys of Har-
 row, his old school:
 Never give in.  Never, never, never, never.
 Never yield to force and the apparently over-
 whelming might of the enemy.  Never yield
 in any way, great or small, large or petty,
 except to convictions of honor and good
 sense.
 Let us resolve to nail this message to
 the masthead of our ship of state in this
 year of decision.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent to have printed in the RECORD the
 following documents: First, a summary
 of Communist violations of the Laotian
 armistice prepared for me by the Library
 of Congress; second, a copy of a state-
 ment released yesterday by the American
 Friends of Vietnam, under the caption of
 "A New Policy for Vietnam"; third, a
 copy of a telegram to the President from
 the Veterans of Foreign Wars; fourth,
 various newspaper clippings bearing on
 the situation in Vietnam.
 There being no objection, the sundry
 documents were ordered to be printed in
 the RECORD, as follows:

 From: Foreign Affairs Division.
 Subject: List of violations by the Commu-
 nist Pathet Lao of the Geneva armistice
 of 1961-62.
 July 27, 1962: Laotian cease-fire committee
 of the three factions (neutralists, rightists,
 and pro-Communist Pathet Lao) reaches an
 agreement on principles to implement a
 truce: forces of each faction will remain in
 their  previous  positions;  frontline  forces
 and military supplies are not to be increased;
 and troops of the three factions will not at-
 tack each other.
 August 22, 1962: Several companies of pro-
 Communist Pathet Lao troops attack out-
 posts of rightist forces near Sam Neua. in
 northeastern Laos.
 765-428-96923
 November 27, 1962: U.S. C-123 cargo plane,
 flying rice and other supplies to neutralist
 forces, is shot down over the Plaine des

 troops tied up with Pathet Lao.
 April 4, 1963: Premier Souvanna Phouma
 announces that Pathet Lao troops have at-
 tacked neutralist troops of Gen. Kong Le in
 the Plaine des Jarres.  On April 8 the U.S.

 April 16, 1963: Following brief cease-fire,
 fighting breaks out again on the Plaine des
 Jarres.  The neutralist forces of Gen. Kong
 Le are attacked and suffer new setbacks.  On
 April 16 U.S. Under Secretary of State George
 Ball says that the United States does not
 rule out the possibility of sending troops
 into Laos if the situation should continue to
 deteriorate. Warnings are also issued by Sec-
 retary of State Dean Rusk on April 18 and
 President Kennedy on April 19.
 May 3, 1963: Pathet Lao troops fire. on two
 helicopters of the International Control Com-
 mission in the Plaine des Jarres, destroying
 one and wounding four occupants.  On May
 10, U.S. Ambassador Leonard Unger accuses
 the Pathet Lao of disrupting the peace and
 violating the Geneva accords, and he says
 that the United States will never leave Laos
 standing alone "to face its enemies from
 within and abroad."
 May 21, 1963: Premier Souvanna Phouma
 issues communique stating that severe fight-
 ing has been going on for 2 days In the

 November 17, 1963: Cease-fire is broken as
 fighting resumes in the Plaine des Jarres.
 Talks between neutralist and Pathet Lao
 military leaders subsequently break down

 January 29, 1984: Neutralist military head-
 quarters reports that six Pathet Lao and four
 North Vietnamese battalions have launched
 an attack in southern Laos, have defeated
 neutralist and rightist forces at Na Kay, and
 are now heading toward the the strategic
 post of Thakhek.
 April 19, 1964: Military coup in Vientiane,
 organized by rightist army officers, ousts gov-
 ernment of Premier Souvanna.  Coup lead-
 ers give as reason for their action the pre-
 mier's failure to establish peace in Laos.
 May 15, 1964: The Laotian Government re-
 ports that Pathet Lao forces have seized Tha
 Thom, a key town about 90 miles northeast
 of Vientiane.  It also report.- that an attack
 on the defense perimeter of Paksane is immi-
 nent.  On May 16, Pathet Lao forces renew
 attacks on neutralist position on the Plaine
 des Jarres.  A State Department spokesman
 calls the new attacks a "flagrant and open
 violation" of the Geneva accords of 1961-62.

 A NEW POLICY FOR VIETNAM
 (Statement by the American Friends of Viet-
 nam)
 THE DILEMMA
 If we are to identify wisely our most effec-
 tive forward course in Vietnam, it is impor-
 tant first to understand the exact nature of
 our dilemma there..  We know the inherent
 generosity, both toward free Vietnam and its
 neighboring countries, which has led us to
 involve our substance and our blood.  We
 know that but for our commitment, free Viet-
 nam would long since have fallen into the
 political darkness and physical despair which
 oppresses Communist North Vietnam.    We
 know that our presence there is in response
 to the wish of most segments of Vietnamese,
 leadership, however they differ among them-
 selves on other matters.  We know that our
 presence there is earnestly desired by most
 neighboring countries of southeast Asia. We
 know that our purpose is to assist responsible
 765-428-96923
 and responsive government and to enable
 Vietnam and its neighbors to maintain na-
 tional independence  against  external en-
 croachment.  We know that we have neither
 wished to "establish" nor "dominate" a Viet-
 namese government nor to seek for ourselves
 political, military, or economic advantage.
 Our dilemma flows in part from the fact
 that this knowledge is not shared by all of
 the Vietnamese people, is not accepted by the
 members of the Vietcong, is not believed in
 parts of the less developed world still suf-
 fering the scars of recent colonial experience.
 Nor, in fact, is this understanding uniformly
 shared by our own people.
 The dilemma is sharpened further by a
 spreading doubt among leadership elements
 in independent southeast Asian countries
 that the United States has staying power.
 Thailand's foreign minister, Thanat Kho-
 man, recently warned members of the Over-
 seas Press Club:  "The Thai Government
 knows much better but some people are not
 sure we can depend, on outside help-especial-
 ly when there is so much talk of quitting and
 going home.  The Communists have never
 spoken that line of quitting.  When they go
 some place they stay there."
 In part, at least, this skepticism is fos-
 tered by the doubt among some Americans
 that any valid purpose led to our presence
 in Vietnam in the first place.
 THE ALTERNATIVES
 The lack of public understanding flows in
 part from inadequate examination of the
 alternatives confronting the United States
 now. In our opinion there are six choices:
 1. Continue as now.  Whether or not the
 Vietcong are, in fact, increasing their ef-
 fectiveness there is a growing conviction. in
 Saigan, in the United States, and in much
 of the rest of the world, that this is so.
 This alone makes continuation of our present
 policy undesirable.   The overriding hazard
 of the present policy is the undeniable fact
 that it has not provided sufficient psycho-
 logical and political potency to sustain a
 Vietnamese Government.
 2. Withdraw.  This would violate our pledge
 not to abandon the Vietnamese people.  It
 would manifest throughout the world a U.S.
 inability to long sustain an effort designed
 to frustrate Communist intentions. The im-

 Approved For Release 2003/12/02 : CIA-RDP75-00149ROO0200310041-4
 35
 plications would be read as eloquently in
 Berlin or in Cuba, as they would be in Viet-
 nam, Indonesia, or India.  There can be no
 question that this alternative would require
 the Governments of the Phiilippines, Thai-
 land, Taiwan, India, Japan, to reassess totally
 present policy and to reorient toward what
 would be the dominating new facts of Asian
 life.
 ("Neutralization" of Vietnam is not sug-
 gested here for a simple reason: genuine and
 reliable neutralization of Vietnam is not pos-
 sible at the present time. What is most often
 talked of in this connection is merely a
 rhetorical  euphemism  designed  to  make
 withdrawal more palatable.   On the other
 hand, the proposals discussed here are valu-
 able to part precisely because they do hold
 the promise that they may generate sufficient
 free Vietnamese vitality to make true and
 assured  neutralization possible  at  some
 future time.)
 3. Military cordon sanitaire across Viet-
 nam and Laos.  An estimated military force
 of up to 100,000 would be involved in mak-
 ing such a cordon truly effective and enemy
 penetration genuinely hazardous.  Its great-
 est contribution would be in providing hard
 evidence of new determination to maintain
 southeast Asian integrity.   Although mili-
 tary effect  of interdicting the Vietcong's
 transport and supply may be limited, it is
 nonetheless one  useful  alternative,  espe-
 cially when employed with other steps out-
 lined here.
 4. Extend military action to the north.
 Until last week, steps taken in this di-
 rection were, in our judgment, not suf l-
 ciently explicit, either to rekindle Vietnam-
 ese faith in our intentions or to inspire con-
 fidence in other Asian countries that we are
 indeed willing to accept risk as the price
 of our commitment to freedom.  The in-
 creased external, Communist intervention in
 South Vietnam has made it both reasonable
 and essential that there be a vigorous anti-
 Communist military response.  The limited
 air strikes in North Vietnam by American
 and Vietnamese planes constituted such an
 appropriate response.
 There are many other forms of stronger
 American action and involvement and they
 are not mutually exclusive.  They include:
 765-428-96923
 (a) Formation of an open, well-publicized
 North Vietnam liberation movement spon-
 soring major psychological operations pro-
 grams, including paramilitary action, against
 the North Vietnamese regime.
 (b)  Establishment  of an  International
 Voluntary Corps dedicated to the mainte-
 nance of free nations in the Mekong basin.
 This corps should consist primarily of vol-
 unteers from Asian countries but may also
 contain a liberal admixture of Americans
 with military experience.  Operating nor-
 mally in small units with sufficient air sup-
 port, this force-under the sponsorship of
 the  proposed  North  Vietnam  Liberation
 Movement-would harass the enemy wher-
 ever suitable targets exist, including targets
 within North Vietnam.
 (c)  Positioning of U.S.  combat   forces
 within South Vietnam to act as a general
 reserve-a sizable firefighting force. Such
 a military contingent (perhaps as many as
 two brigades) should not be used for routine
 combat or security duties, but as an imme-
 diate-reaction  fighting force  intended                                                                                                       to
 engage Vietcong troops in fixed positions.
 Desirably, combat elements from other na-
 tions will be attached to this force.
 (d) Continued bombing of selected mili-
 tary targets in North Vietnam.  In contrast
 to the indiscriminate terrorist activity of the
 Vietcong in South Vietnam, the free world's
 concern for the Vietnamese people in both
 halves of the country make it undesirable for
 us to conduct warfare upon cities where the
 innocent will be hurt.  However, those mili-
 tary targets in North Vietnam which are vital
 to their aggressive capability and which can
 be destroyed with our assistance are, in our
 view, legitimate targets for stage-by-stage
 destruction.
 What is the risk involved in such action?
 In our judgment the possibility of Chinese
 involvement in South Vietnam would be only
 slightly increased.  The possibility of Chi-
 nese help thrust upon North Vietnam would
 be greater.  However, this probability may be
 precisely what is needed to make clear to
 even the most Communist leaders of North
 Vietnam how undesirable such help is to
 them in the long run.  A heightened aware-
 ness of this danger might, in fact, force
 greater restraint upon the Government in
 Hanoi than our present policy can achieve.

 Frankly, however, the direct military dam-
 age inflicted on the Communist regime In
 North Vietnam is the lesser of our reasons
 for suggesting that these steps be under-
 taken.                        In our opinion, it is urgent that the
 people of free Vietnam be assured that Presi-
 dent Johnson means what he says-that we
 mean to stay and help, no matter what risks
 we must incur.  It is equally urgent that
 these  intentions  be  understood  also  in
 Japan, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia,
 the rest of Asia, and the world.  Stanch,
 long-term    American    commitment-fully
 communicated and understood-would pro-
 vide a lift to morale in free Vietnam, inject
 new vitality in the Vietnamese Government
 and require a new assessment of the United
 States  among  neighboring countries and
 among Asian allies elsewhere.
 There is one final reason we support this
 painful course  of action.  Basic require-
 ments for victory in Vietnam are not primar-
 ily military.                                    They are psychological, social,
 and economic.  Below we address ourselves
 to instruments which can meet the nonmili-
 tary aspects of the undertaking. But neither
 the economic nor political measures we pro-
 pose will get off the ground without evidence
 of the seriousness of our military intention,
 Nor will our military commitment produce
 the desired results without the companion
 economic and psychological supports.
 America's experience in relation to the in-
 stability In postwar Europe is clearly rele-
 vant.  The Marshall plan did not begin to
 come to life until the physical security prom-
 ised by NATO was added.  Nor would NATO
 by itself have been meaningful without the
 human vision and economic future presented
 by the Marshall plan.
 5. Forging a more popular or responsive
 government.  It is clear that the difficulties
 confronting any Vietnamese Government un-
 der Communist attack are enormous.  We
 can but sympathize with those who carry
 the burdens of government in circumstances
 so frustrating and continuously demanding.
 It is possible that 20 years of civil war, co-
 lonial war, and Communist insurrectionary
 war, have so debilitated the structure of gov-
 ernment as to preclude the immediate pos-
 siblity, no matter how desirable, of absolutely
 stable government.  There are political per-
 sonalities with nationalist backgrounds who
 are deserving of our help and encourage-
 ment, We must do what we can to help them
 and bring them forward., At the same time,
 we must help to diminish the present conflict
 of personalities that has proved in past years
 to be so destructive. In any event, we believe
 it is futile to concentrate, as we have in the
 past, on personalities, rather than on pur-
 poses, ideas, and institutions.
 6. Injection of new purpose.  If charis-
 matic leadership is unavailable, charismatic,
 purpose can be found.  One aspect of that
 purpose involves the modest extension of
 military effort discussed above.  It involves
 the clear demonstration that the United
 States means to remain committed even at
 enlarged risk.  And such charismatic pur-
 pose must, of necessity, accept as workable
 "the best available choices of Vietnamese
 Government personnel"-choices made  by
 the Vietnamese not by us.  But our object
 would be to harness our military commit-
 ment and the Vietnamese effort to an in-
 finitely larger objective than has previously
 motivated our participation. It would make
 crystal clear that the objectives which unite
 us with the Vietnamese people, as with our
 other allies on southeast Asia, are construc-
 tive and inextricably linked to the welfare
 of all southeast Asian peoples.
 We suggest that all of our military, po-
 litical, and economic programs in Vietnam be
 subordinated to a massive southeast Asian
 development program.  A Johnson plan for
 the full flowering of southeast Asian econom-
 ic resources and independence will have as
 much potency and promise for success in
 that corner of the world as the Marshall plan
 did in Europe and the Tennessee Valley Au-
 thority in the United States.
 The Mekong Basin is one of the world's
 richest- and least developed areas.  In an
 area of the world already food rich there is an
 opportunity to harness the tributaries of the
 Mekong Basin toward an economic flowering
 offering infinite promise to Laos, Cambodia,
 and Thailand as well as to South Vietnam,
 and offering to the people and the Govern-,
 ment of North Vietnam economic oppor-
 tunity which only their blindness or non-
 cooperation can frustrate. To Burma, Malay-
 sia, and even India, this would present an op-
 portunity in both economic and political
 terms which, especially at this moment, could
 not possibly  be  more desirable.  To the
 Philippines such a program would provide

 Approved For Release 2003/12/02 : CIA-RDP75-00149R000200310041-4
 37
 the same magnetic opportunity for participa-
 tion as led them generously to create and
 man Operation Brotherhood a decade ago.
 It would also offer the first possibility of
 really involving the wealth and energy of the
 Japanese Government and people.  A John-
 son development plan for southeast Asia
 would manifest to the entire world that the
 welfare of the people of southeast Asia is
 our only purpose.
 The Mekong Basin development program
 will provide for the first time a future-
 oriented thrust around which a Vietnamese
 resurgency program can be made vital and
 toward which the efforts of Americans, Ja-
 panese, Lao, Thai, Cambodians, and Filipinos
 can hopefully be attracted.
 THE MISSING LINK
 Within the last 3 years the Communist
 nations have revealed their inability to meet
 their own most pressing economic needs,
 The shortcut to the future has suddenly
 proved to be a dead end of economic failure,
 recrimination, and political embarrassment.
 But this has not frustrated the wars of na-
 tional liberation nor prevented the Com-
 munists from mounting insurrectionary war-
 fare whether in Congo or Vietnam. National
 governments and native peoples assaulted by
 such Communist purposes have, at best,
 sought to sustain their own energy through
 defensive effort.  Virtually unused has been
 the enormous potential for hope which can
 be found only in the non-Communist, world,
 cooperatively employing the resources of the
 United States and nations friendly to it
 whether in Asia, the Pacific, or Western
 Europe.
 We have offered to the Vietnamese people
 our assistance in their struggle for national
 independence. We have failed, however, to
 harness that struggle and our assistance to
 an all but miraculous future, a flowering of
 man, his capabilities, his resources, his aspi-
 rations.  Ours indeed is the truly revolu-
 tionary  opportunity.  The  Johnson  plan
 offers to southeast Asia a genuine oppor-
 tunity to harness nature, enlarge justice, ex-
 tend life, eradicate the scourges of illness and
 illiteracy and enable long-suffering peoples
 to reap the fruits of their soil and the per-
 manent benefits of national independence.
 Behind this large vision, men throughout the
 world may be led to voluntary association in
 Lincoln Brigades,  Gandhi Brigades, Mag-
 765-428-96923
 saysay, and Marti Brigades-an international
 volunteer corps for peace and freedom.
 The Johnson plan for the development of
 the Mekong Basin has, in our judgment, the
 following potential, essentially unavailable
 in the present circumstances:
 1. It will inject dramatic, viable, and po-
 litically potent new purpose adequate to
 sustain popular support of Vietnamese Gov-
 ernment leaders.
 2. It will infuse new energy into the Viet-
 namese already risking their lives in daily
 defense against the Vietcong.
 3. The plan offers concrete reasons for the
 cooperative  involvement  of  neighboring
 southeast Asian countries as well as a gener-
 ous commitment able to sustain emotionally
 an international corps of volunteers.
 4. It contains an enormous incentive to
 North Vietnam to turn away from its present
 fratricidal course.
 5. Finally, the Johnson plan constitutes a
 pioneering laboratory of hopeful consequence
 to other less developed areas where Commu-
 nist insurrectionary warfare presently finds
 soil in which to sow the seeds of destruction.
 THE PRESIDENT,
 The White House,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: The Veterans of For-
 eign Wars wholeheartedly and without res-
 ervation supports your decision in taking
 retaliatory armed action against the Com-
 munist aggressors in North Vietnam.  Your
 wise and bold decision in this matter will go
 far toward assuring our allies throughout all
 Asia that the United States stands by its
 commitments and will not be intimidated by
 Communist threats and aggressive action.
 U.S. action against North Vietnam is en-
 tirely  consistent  with  the  unanimously
 passed resolution of our 1964 VFW national
 convention which called for all action nec-
 essary to win in South Vietnam.  The VFW,
 consisting of 1,300,000 overseas combat vet-
 erans fully recognizes that communism has
 launched a  deliberate attack against all
 southeast Asia and, consequently, the inter-
 est of U.S. security and the cause of free-
 dom can be protected, in the final analysis,
 only by the judicious and willing use of
 military power.

 REMARKS OF HON. WILLIAM
 PROXMIRE
 (The text of the U.S. White Paper on
 North  Vietnamese  intervention  in  South
 Vietnam was inserted into the RECORD by
 Senator WILLIAM PROXMIRE of Wisconsin in
 his remarks of March 1, 1965.   The text is
 reproduced below.)
 AGGRESSION  FROM THE NORTH-THE RECORD
 or NORTH VIETNAM'S CAMPAIGN To CONQUER
 SOUTH VIETNAM
 "Our purpose in Vietnam is to join in the
 defense and protection of freedom of a brave
 people who are under attack that is con-
 trolled and that is directed from outside
 their country." (President Lyndon B. John-
 son, February 17, 1965.)
 INTRODUCTION
 South Vietnam is fighting for its life
 against a brutal campaign of terror and
 armed attack inspired, directed, supplied,
 and controlled by the Communist regime in
 Hanoi.  This flagrant aggression has been
 going on for years, but recently the pace
 has quickened and the threat has now be-
 come acute.
 The war In Vietnam is a new kind of
 war, a fact as yet poorly understood in most
 parts of the world.  Much of the confusion
 that prevails in the thinking of many peo-
 ple, and even many governments, stems from
 this basic misunderstanding.  For in Viet-
 nam a totally new brand of aggression has
 been loosed against an independent people
 who want to make their own way in peace
 and freedom.
 Vietnam is not another Greece, where in-
 digenous  guerrilla  forces  used  friendly
 neighboring territory as a sanctuary.
 Vietnam is not another Malaya, where
 Communist guerrillas were, for the most
 part,  physically distinguishable from the
 peaceful majority they sought to control.
 Vietnam is not another Philippines, where
 Communist guerrillas were physically sepa-
 rated from the source of their moral and
 physical support.
 Above all, the war in Vietnam is not a
 spontaneous and local rebellion against the
 established government.
 There  are  elements  in  the  Communist
 program of conquest directed against South
 Vietnam common to each of the previous
 areas of aggression and subversion.    But
 there  is one  fundamental  difference. In
 Vietnam a Communist government has set
 out deliberately to conquer a sovereign peo-
 ple in a neighboring state.                                      And to achieve
 its end, it has used every resource of its
 own government to carry out its carefully
 planned program of concealed aggression.
 North Vietnam's commitment to seize con-
 trol of the South 1s no less total than was
 the commitment of the regime in North
 Korea in 1950.   But knowing the conse-
 quences of the latter's undisguised attack,
 765-428-96923
 the planners in Hanoi have tried desperately
 to conceal their hand.  They have failed
 and their aggression is as real as that of
 an invading army.
 This report is a summary of the massive
 evidence of North Vietnamese aggression ob-
 tained by . the Government of South Viet-
 nam.  This evidence has been jointly ana-
 lyzed by South Vietnamese and American ex-
 perts.
 The evidence shows that the hard core of
 the Communist forces attacking South Viet-
 nam were trained in the north and ordered
 into the south by. Hanoi.  It shows that the
 key leadership of the Vietcong (VC), the
 officers and much of the cadre, many of the
 technicians, political, organizers, and propa-
 grandists have come from the north and oper-
 ate under Hanoi's direction.  It shows that
 the training of essential military personnel
 and their infiltration into the south is di-
 rected by the military high command in
 Hanoi.  (See see. I.)
 The evidence shows that many of the
 weapons and much of the ammunition and
 other supplies used by the Vietcong have
 been sent into South Vietnam from Hanoi.
 In recent months new types of weapons have
 been introduced in the VC army, for which
 all ammunition must come from outside
 sources.  Communist China and other Com-
 munist States have been the prime suppliers
 of these weapons and ammunition, and they
 have  been  channeled  primarily  through
 North Vietnam. (See sec. II.)
 The directing force behind the effort to
 conquer South Vietnam is the Communist
 Party in the north, the Lao Dong (Workers)
 Party.  As in every Communist State, the
 party is an integral part of the regime itself.
 North Vietnamese officials  have expressed
 their firm determination to absorb South
 Vietnam into the Communist world.  (See
 sec. III.)
 Through its central committee, which con-
 trols the government of the north, the Lao
 Dong Party directs the total political and
 military effort of the Vietcong.  The military
 high command in the north trains the mili-
 tary men and sends them into South Viet-
 nam.  The Central Research Agency, North
 Vietnam's central intelligence organization,
 directs the elaborate espionage and subver-
 sion effort.  The extensive political-military
 organization in the north which directs the
 Vietcong  war effort Is described in sec-
 tion IV.
 Under Hanoi's overall direction the Com-
 munists have established an extensive ma-
 chine for carrying on the war within South
 Vietnam.  The focal point is the Central
 Office for South Vietnam with its political
 and military subsections and other special-
 ized agencies.  A subordinate part of this
 Central Office is the Liberation Front for
 South Vietnam.  The front was formed at
 Hanoi's order in 1960.  Its principal func-
 tion is to influence opinion abroad and to

 39
 create the false Impression that the aggres-
 sion in South Vietnam is an indigenous rebel-
 lion against the  established  government.
 (See sec. IV.)
 For more than 10 years the people and the
 Government of South Vietnam, exercising the
 inherent right of self-defense, have fought
 back against these efforts to extend Commu-
 nist power south across the 17th parallel.
 The United States has responded to the
 appeals of the Government of the Republic
 of Vietnam for help in this defense of the
 freedom and independence of its land and its
 people.
 In 1961 the Department of State issued a
 report called "A Threat to the Peace."  It
 described North Vietnam's program to seize
 South Vietnam.  The evidence in that report
 had been presented by the Government of
 the Republic of Vietnam to the International
 Control Commission (ICC).  A special re-
 port by the ICC in June 1962 upheld the
 validity of that evidence. The Commission
 held that there was "sufficient evidence to
 show beyond reasonable doubt" that North
 Vietnam had sent arms and men into South
 Vietnam to carry out subversion with the
 aim of overthrowing the legal government
 there.  The ICC found the authorities in
 Hanoi in specific violation of four provisions
 of the Geneva accords of 1954.
 Since then, new and even more impressive
 evidence of Hanoi's aggression has accumu-
 lated. The Government of the United States
 believes that evidence should be presented
 to its own citizens and to the world.  It is
 important for freemen to know what has
 been happening in Vietnam, and how, and
 why.  That is the purpose of this report.
 1. HANOI SUPPLIES THE KEY PERSONNEL FOR THE
 ARMED AGGRESSION AGAINST SOUTH VIETNAM
 The hard core of the Communist forces
 attacking South Vietnam are men trained in
 North Vietnam.  They are ordered into the
 south and remain under the military dis-
 cipline of the military high command in
 Hanoi.  Special training camps operated by
 the North Vietnamese Army gave political
 and. military training to the infiltrators.  In-
 creasingly the forces sent into the south are
 native North Vietnamese who have never seen
 South Vietnam.  A special infiltration unit,
 the 70th Transportation Group, is responsible
 for. moving men from North Vietnam into the
 south via infiltration trails through Laos.
 Another special unit, the maritime infiltra-
 tion group, spends weapons and supplies
 and agents by sea into the south.
 The infiltration rate has been increasing.
 From 1959 to 1960, when Hanoi was establish-
 ing its infiltration pipeline, at least 1,800
 men, and possibly 2,700 more, moved into
 South Vietnam from the north.  The flow
 increased to a minimum of 3,700 in 1961 and
 1 For the text of pertinent sections of the
 ICC report, see app. A.
 765-428-96923
 at least 5,400 in 1962.  There was a modest
 decrease in 1963 to 4,200 confirmed infiltra-
 tors, though later evidence is likely to raise
 this figure.
 For 1964 the evidence is still incomplete.
 However, it already shows that a minimum
 of 4,400 Infiltrators entered the south, and
 it is estimated more than 3,000 others were
 sent in.
 There is usually a time lag between the
 entry of infiltrating troops and the discovery
 of clear evidence they have entered.  This
 fact, plus collateral evidence of increased use
 of the infiltration routes, suggests strongly
 that 1964 was probably the year of greatest
 infiltration so far.
 Thus, since 1959, nearly 20,000 VC officers,
 soldiers, and technicians are known to have
 entered South Vietnam under orders from
 Hanoi.  Additional  Information  indicates
 that an estimated 17,000 more infiltrators
 were dispatched to the south by the regime
 in Hanoi during the past 6 years.  It can
 reasonably be assumed that still other infil-
 tration groups have entered 'the south for
 which there is no evidence yet available.
 To some the level of infiltration from the
 north may seem modest in comparison with
 the total size of the Armed Forces of the Re-
 public of Vietnam.  But one-for-one calcu-
 lations are totally misleading in the kind of
 warfare going on in Vietnam.  First, a high
 proportion of infiltrators from the north are
 well-trained officers, cadres, and specialists.
 Second, it has long been realized that in
 guerrilla combat the burdens of defense are
 vastly heavier than those of attack.  In Ma-
 laya, the Philippines, and elsewhere a ratio
 of at least 10 to 1 in favor of the forces of
 order was required to meet successfully the
 threat of the guerrillas hit-and-run tactics.
 In the calculus of guerrilla warfare the
 scale of North Vietnamese infiltration into
 the south takes on a very different meaning.
 For the infiltration of 5,000 guerrilla fighters
 In a given year is the equivalent of marching
 perhaps 50,000  regular troops  across the
 border, in terms of the burden placed on the
 defenders.
 Above all, the number of proved and prob-
 able infiltrators from the north should be
 seen in relation to the size of the VC forces.
 It is now estimated that the Vietcong num-
 ber approximately 35,000 so-called hard-core
 forces, and another 60,000 to 80,000 local
 forces.  It is thus apparent that infiltrators
 from the north-allowing for casualties-
 make up the majority of the so-called hard-
 core Vietcong.  Personnel from the north,
 in short, are now and have always been the
 backbone of the entire VC operation.
 It Is true that many of the lower level ele-
 ments of the VC forces are recruited within
 South Vietnam. However, the thousands of
 reported cases of VC kidnapings and terror-
 ism make it abundantly clear that threats
 and other pressures by the Vietcong play a
 major part in such recruitment.

 A. The infiltration process
 The infiltration routes supply hard-core
 units with most of their officers and non-
 commissioned personnel.  This source helps
 fill the gaps left by battle casualties, illness,
 and defection and insures continued control
 by Hanoi. Also, as the nature of the conflict
 has changed, North Vietnam has supplied
 the Vietcong with technical specialists via
 the infiltration routes.  These have included
 men trained in armor and ordnance, anti-
 aircraft, and communications as well as med-
 ical corpsmen and transport experts.
 There is no single infiltration route from
 the north to South Vietnam.  But by far
 the biggest percentage of infiltrators follow
 the same  general course.   The principal
 training center for North Vietnamese Army
 men assigned to join the Vietcong has been
 at Xuan Mai near Hanoi. Recently captured
 Vietcong have also reported an infiltration
 training camp at Thanh Hoa. After comple-
 tion of their training course-which involves
 political and propaganda work as well as
 military  subjects-infiltrating  units  are
 moved to Vinh on the east coast. Many have
 made stopovers at a staging area in Deng Hot
 where  additional  training  is  conducted.
 From there they go by truck to the Laos
 border.
 Then, usually after several days' rest, in-
 filtrators  move                                              southward through Laos.
 Generally they move along the Laos-South
 Vietnam border.    Responsibility for infiltra-
 tion from North Vietnam through Laos be-
 longs to the 70th Transportation Group of
 the North Vietnamese Army.   After a time
 the infiltration groups turn eastward, enter-
 ing South Vietnam in Quang Nam, Quang
 Tri, Thua Thien, Kontum, or another of
 the border provinces.
 The Communists have established regular
 lanes for infiltration with way stations es-
 tablished about 1 day's march apart.  The
 way stations are equipped to quarter and
 feed the Vietcong passing through. Infil-
 trators who suffer from malaria or other ill-
 nesses stay at the stations until they recover
 sufficiently to join another passing group
 moving south.
 The map on page 4 [not shown in RECORD]
 shows the infiltration route from North Viet-
 nam to the south followed by VC Sgt. Huynh
 Van Tay and a group of North Vietnamese
 Army officers and men in September 1963.
 Tay was captured during an engagement in
 Chuong Thien Province in April 1964.
 Local guides lead the infiltration groups
 along the secret trails.  Generally they di-
 rect the infiltrators from halfway between
 two stations, through their own base sta-
 tion, and on halfway to the next supply base.
 Thus the guides are kept in ignorance of all
 but their own way stations.  Only group
 leaders are permitted to talk with the guides
 in order to preserve maximum security. The
 765-428-96923
 men are discouraged from asking where they
 are or where they are going .2
 The same system of trails and guides used
 along the Lao infiltration routes is used
 within South Vietnam itself.  Vietcong in-
 filtrators may report directly to a reassign-
 ment center in the highlands as soon as they
 enter South Vietnam.  But in the past year
 or more some groups have moved down trails
 in South Vietnam to provinces along the
 Cambodian border and near Saigon before re-
 ceiving their unit assignment.  Within South
 Vietnam infiltration and supplies are han-
 dled by VC units such as the Nam Son Trans-
 portation Group.
 At the Laos border crossing point infil-
 trators are reequipped.  Their North Viet-
 namese Army uniforms must be turned in.
 They must give up all personal papers, let-
 ters, notebooks, and photographs that might
 be incriminating.  Document control over
 the infiltrators has been tightened consider-
 ably over the past 2 years.  A number of
 Vietnamese infiltrators have told of being
 fitted out with Lao neutralist uniforms for
 their passage through Laos.
 Infiltration groups are usually issued a set
 of black civilian pajama-like clothes, two
 unmarked  uniforms,  rubber  sandals,  a
 sweater, a hammock, mosquito netting, and
 waterproof sheeting.  They carry a 3- to 5-
 day supply of food.  A packet of medicines
 and bandages is usually provided.
 The  size of  infiltration  groups varies
 widely.  Prisoners have mentioned units as
 small as 5 men and as large as 500. Gen-
 erally the groups number 40 to 50.                                                                                           When
 they arrive in South Vietnam these groups
 are usually split up and assigned to various
 VC units as replacements, although some
 have remained intact.
 B. Military personnel
 The following are individual ease histories
 of North Vietnamese soldiers sent by the
 Hanoi regime into South Vietnam.  They are
 only an illustrative group.  They show that
 the leadership and specialized personnel for
 the guerrilla war in South Vietnam consists
 in large part of members of the North Viet-
 nam armed forces, trained in the North and
 subject to the command and discipline of
 Hanoi.
 1. Tran Quoc Dan
 Dan was a VC major, commander of the
 60th Battalion (sometimes known as the 34th
 Group of the Thon-Kim Battalion).  Disil-
 lusioned with fighting his own countrymen
 and with communism and the lies of the
 Hanoi regime, he surrendered to the authori-
 ties in South Vietnam on February 11, 1983.

 At the age of 15 he joined the revolutionary
 army (Viet Minh) and fought against the
 French forces until 1964 when the Geneva
 accords ended the Indochina war. As a regu-
 lar in the Viet Minh forces, he was moved to
 North Vietnam.  He became an officer in the
 so-called people's army.
 In March 1962 Major Dan received orders
 to prepare to move to South Vietnam.  He
 had been exposed to massive propaganda in
 the north which told of the destitution of the
 peasants in the south and said that the
 Americans had taken over the French role of
 colonialists.  He said later that an important
 reason for his decision to surrender was that
 he discovered these propaganda themes were
 lies.  He found the peasants more prosperous
 than the people in the north.  And he recog-
 nized quickly that he was not fighting the
 Americans but his own people.
 With the 600 men of his unit, Major Dan
 left Hanoi on March 23, 1962.  They traveled
 through the Laos corridor.  His group joined
 up with the Vietcong 1st Regiment in cen-
 tral Vietnam.
 The 35-year-old major took part in 45 ac-
 tions and was wounded once in an unsuc-
 cessful VC attack on an outpost.  As time
 passed he became increasingly discouraged
 by his experience as a VC troop commander.
 Most of all, he said, he was tired of killing
 other Vietnamese.  After several months of
 soul-searching he decided to surrender to
 the authorities of the Republic of Vietnam.
 He has volunteered to do "anything to serve
 the national cause" of South Vietnam.
 2. Vo Thoi
 Sgt. Vo Thoi (Communist Party alias Vo
 Bien) was an assistant squad leader in the
 VC Tay Son 22d Battalion. On the night of
 October 7, 1963, his unit attacked An Tuong
 village in Binh Dinh Province.  After over-
 running the village, Vo's company was as-
 signed to set up an ambush against Repub-
 lic of Vietnam troops rushing to defend the
 village.   In the ensuing fight Vo was seri-
 ously wounded.  He was picked up by local
 farmers and turned over to the authorities.
 Vo's life and experiences were similar to
 those of thousands of Vietcong.  Born in
 Quang      Ngai  Province  in  1932, he  went
 through 5 years of school and then worked
 on his parents' small farm.    During the war
 against the French he joined the Viet Minh
 forces.    When the fighting ended, he was
 transferred to North Vietnam with his unit,
 the 210th Regiment.  He remained in the
 North Vietnamese Army until 1960 when he
 was sent to work on a state farm in Nghe An
 Province.  Vo said 3,000 men and women
 worked on the farm, of whom 400 were sol-
 diers.                                      In September 1962 Vo was told he
 must join the newly activated 22d Battalion.
 All the members of the battalion came from
 provinces in South Vietnam, from Quang Tri
 to Phu Yen.  But it was not an ordinary
 battalion; two-thirds of its members were
 cadre with. ranks up to senior capitain.
 765.428-96923
 The group was put through an advanced
 training course that lasted 6 months.  The
 training program included combat tactics
 for units from squad to company and the
 techniques of guerrilla and counterguerrilla
 fighting.  There were heavy doses of politi-
 cal indoctrination.
 On March 5, 1963, the 22d Battalion re-
 ceived orders to move south.  They were
 transported in trucks from Nghe An Province
 to Dong Hoi in Quang Binh, just north of
 the 17th parallel.  From there the unit was
 moved westward to the Lao border.  Then
 the more than 300 men began walking to
 the south following mountain trails in Laos
 and the Vietnam border area.  They marched
 by day, rested at night.  Every fifth day
 they stopped at a way station for a full day's
 rest.  One company dropped off at Thua
 Thiem Province.  Vo and the remainder of
 the group marched on to Pleiku Province.
 Two fully armed companies from a neighbor-
 ing province were assigned to the battalion.
 The assignment given to the battalion was
 to harass strategic hamlets in the Hoai An
 district of Binh Dinh, to round up cattle
 and rice, to kill or kidnap cadre of the
 Government forces,  and  to  recruit  local
 youth for service with the Vietcong.
 3. Nguyen Thao
 Nguyen Thao was a VC weapons tech-
 nician.                                                                                                A native of Khanh Hao Province in
 South Vietnam, he joined the Viet Minh in
 1950.  He worked at a secret arsenal manu-
 facturing weapons for use by the guerrilla
 forces. He went to North Vietnam after the
 Geneva accords were signed in 1954.   In
 North  Vietnam  he  attended  a technical
 school specializing in arms and manufacture.
 He received special training in foreign small
 arms and artillery.
 At the end of 1962 he was ordered to Ha
 Dong to attend a special course of political
 training in preparation for infiltrating into
 South  Vietnam.   On  completion  of  the
 training course he was assigned to a group
 of 14 men who would move to the south to-
 gether.                                                                                               Nguyen Thao said the group was
 composed of four armament specialists, two
 chemical engineers, and eight middle-level
 technical cadre.
 They left Ha Dong in March 1963, crossed
 into Laos, and reached their destination in
 the northern part of South Vietnam in May.
 Nguyen Thao went to work at a secret VC
 arsenal near the Quang Ngai border.  Fifty
 men, some local workers, manned the arsenal
 weapons section.  The group manufactured
 mines and grenades for. the VC units in the
 area and repaired weapons.
 Nguyen Thao said he soon realized from
 talking with the local workers at the arsenal
 that most of what he had heard in the North
 about  conditions  in  South  Vietnam was
 wrong.  He said the Communists had de-
 ceived him.                                                                                                 Two months after his arrival at
 the arsenal he decided to defect.  He asked
 permission to rejoin his family and to work

 in a national defense factory and continue
 his studies.
 4. Nguyen Viet Le
 This VC soldier was born in Quang Nam
 Province in South Vietnam.  He served with
 the 305th Division of the Viet Minh and
 moved to North Vietnam in 1954.  In April
 1961, Nguyen Viet Le and his unit, the 50th
 Battalion, moved into Laos. He said the unit
 remained in Laos for 2 months, during which
 it fought  in  four  battles  alongside  the
 Pathet Lao.  During these engagements one
 of the battalion's four companies was badly
 mauled and had to be returned to North
 Vietnam.
 The other three companies were assigned
 to South Vietnam.  They arrived in Quang
 Ngai Province in the summer of 1961.  For a
 month they rested and waited for orders.
 They took part in a major action against an
 outpost of the Government of South Viet-
 nam in September.  Nguyen Viet Le was
 captured during a battle in Quang Ngai
 Province in April 1962.
 5. Nguyen True
 Corp. Nguyen True was born in 1933, the
 son of a farmer in Phu Yen Province in
 South Vietnam. From 1949 to 1954 he served
 as a courier and then as a guerrilla fighter
 with the Viet Minh. In early 1955 he board-
 ed a Soviet ship and moved with his unit,
 the 40th Battalion, to North Vietnam.  He
 remained in the army, but in 1959, bothered
 by illness, he went to work on a state farm.
 In August 1962 Nguyen True was notified
 that he was back in the army and that he was
 being sent to South Vietnam.  He reported
 to the Xuan Mai training center and under-
 went 8 months of military and political re-
 education.  His unit was the newly activated
 22d Battalion.  The training course was com-
 pleted in February 1963, but departure for
 South Vietnam was delayed until April.
 For infiltration purposes the battalion was
 divided into two groups.  On April 27, Ngu-
 yen True and his group boarded trucks at
 Xuan Mai.  They went first to Vinh, then on
 to Dong Hoi, and finally to the Laos-North
 Vietnam border.  There they doffed their
 North Vietnamese army uniforms and put on
 black peasants' clothing.  The march to the
 south began, sometimes in Lao territory,
 sometimes in Vietnam. They passed through
 Thua Thien Province, then Quang Nam,
 Quang Tin, and Quang Ngai, and finally to
 their destination, Pleiku. Each day they had
 a new guide, generally one of the mountain
 people of the area.
 Nguyen said that he and most of the troops
 who were sent north after the Indochina
 war wanted to return to their homes and
 rejoin their families. In August 1963 Nguyen
 True was sent out on a foraging expedition
 to find food for his unit. He took the oppor-
 tunity to defect to Government forces at An
 Tuc in Binh Dinh Province.
 765-428--96923
 6.. Nguyen Cam
 Cam is the son of a farmer in Quang Tin
 Province.  Born in 1929, he joined the Viet-
 minh youth group in his home village in 1946.
 In 1 year he became a guerrilla fighter.  In
 1954, as the Indochina war was drawing to a
 close, he was serving with the Vietminh 20th
 Battalion. In May 1955 he went to North
 Vietnam with his unit.
 Ill health caused his transfer to an agri-
 cultural camp in 1958.  By 1960 he was back
 in uniform, serving in the 210th Regiment.
 In May of that year he was assigned to a
 small group that was to set up a metallurgi-
 cal workshop.  Early in 1961 he was sent to
 a metallurgical class in Nghe An Province.
 They were taught a simple form of cast iron
 production, simple blast furnace construc-
 tion, and similar skills. Their instructor was
 an engineer from the Hanoi industrial de-
 partment.
 Their special course completed, Cam and
 his group of 35 men prepared to go to South
 Vietnam.  They went by truck from their
 training center at Nghe An to the Lao bor-
 der.  After 19 days marching through Laos,
 they arrived in the vicinity of Tchepone.
 There they waited for 3 days until food sup-
 plies could be airdropped by a North Viet-
 namese plane.  Nineteen days of walking
 took them to the Laos-South Vietnam bor-
 der.
 Delayed en route by illness, Cam finally
 reached his destination in November 1961.
 It was a secret VC iron foundry in Kontum
 Province.   Several iron ore deposits were
 nearby, and the hill people had long used
 the iron to make knives and simple tools.
 Cam's job was building kilns to smelt the
 ore.  The Vietcong hoped to use the iron
 for mines and grenades.
 On August 4, 1963, Sergeant Cam went
 to a nearby village to buy salt for his group.
 On his return he found his comrades had
 gone to one of their cultivated fields to
 gather corn, and he joined them.  The group
 was interrupted at their work by a Viet-
 namese ranger company.  After a brief fight
 Cam was taken prisoner.
 7. Nguyen Hong That
 Thai, 32 years old, was born and grew up
 in Quang Nkai Province in South Vietnam.
 After service with the Vietminh we was
 moved to North Vietnam in 1954.  After 3
 years of military service he was assigned to
 a military farm.  In December 1961 he was
 recalled to his former unit, the 305th Divi-
 sion, and went to the special training camp
 at Xuan Mai in preparation for fighting with
 the Vietcong in South Vietnam.
 Training  began  in  January  1962  and
 lasted for 4 months, The training group,
 designated the 32d Battalion, was composed
 of 650 men who came from various branches
 of the North Vietnamese Army-engineers,
 artillery, airborne, transport, marines, and
 some factory workers and students.  Three-

 fourths of the training was military (guer-
 rilla tactics, ambushes, sabotage, etc.) and
 one-fourth  was  political.   In  the  latter,
 heavy emphasis was laid on the necessity
 for armed seizure of power in the south.
 Group 32 was divided into sections and
 began, infiltrating to the south on July 14,
 1962. It moved in three groups.  Thai said
 it took his group more than 55 days to travel
 from North Vietnam through Laos to Quang
 Ngai Province in the south. He reported that
 all the communications and liaison stations
 on the route to South Vietnam are now op-
 erated by the Army of North Vietnam.  Soon
 after his arrival in South Vietnam, Thai was
 promoted to the rank of lieutenant.  He was
 made a platoon leader in the 20th Vietcong
 Highland Battalion.  In February 1963 the
 unit moved from Quang Nam to Kontum
 Province,
 Combat conditions and the rigors of guer-
 rilla life began to depress Thai.  He said he
 wanted only to rejoin his family and live in
 peace. In September he asked and received
 permission to visit his family in Quang Ngai.
 When he got home, he surrendered to a South
 Vietnamese Army post.
 8. Dao Kien Lap
 Lap is a civilian radio technician.  He has
 been a member of the Communist Party in
 North Vietnam since 1955.  In February 1963
 he was selected for assignment to South
 Vietnam where he was to work with the
 Liberation Front.  He infiltrated into South
 Vietnam with a group of about 70 civilian
 specialists.  They included doctors, pharma-
 cists,  union  organizers,  radio  specialists,
 propagandists, and youth organizers. One of
 the Infiltrators in Dao's group was a man
 named Binh, publisher of the newspaper
 Labor of the Lao Dong Party.  Another was
 a member of the city soviet of Hanoi.
 The specialists in Dao's group received 3
 months of basic military training at Son
 Tay, and then departed for the south in mid-
 June.  Their orders were to report to the
 central office of the Vietcong in South Viet-
 nam where they would be assigned accord-
 ing to their individual specialties.  Dao and
 Binh were to help run a radio station of the
 Liberation Front.
 They traveled through Laos and along the
 Vietnam border.  They had to stop for sev-
 eral weeks in Quang Nam Province to recu-
 perate from their travels.  On October 1 they
 were directed by guides to a VC station in
 Ban Me Thuot.
 Dao said he had by then decided to defect
 to the government authorities in the south.
 He set off with one companion, but they were
 separated as they crossed a swiftly flowing
 river.  Dao gave himself up at a government
 post in Ban Me Thuot on October 13, 1963.
 9. Tran Ngoc Linh
 Linh  was  a  Vietcong  senior  sergeant,
 leader of a reconnaissance platoon. He is the
 son of a middle-class farm family in Tay
 765-428-96923
 Ninh Province.  He served with the Viet
 Minh against the French and moved to North
 Vietnam in 1954. He spent the next 7 years
 in the North Vietnamese Army.  In Septem-
 ber 1962 Linh was assigned to the Xuan Mai
 training center at Ha Dong to prepare for
 duty in South Vietnam. His group was given
 a 4-month refresher course in infantry tac-
 tics with emphasis on guerilla fighting. Then
 he received 6 months of special training in
 the use of machineguns against aircraft.
 Antiaircraft training has become an increas-
 ingly important part of the preparation of
 North Vietnamese troops assigned to the
 Vietcong.
 Linh and about 120 others made up the
 406th Infiltration Group commander by Sen-
 ior Capt. Nguyen Van Do. They were divided
 into four platoons.  During the final 2 weeks
 of preparation each member of the group
 was issued new equipment-black, pajama-
 like uniforms, a khaki uniform, a hammock,
 mosquito netting, rubber sandals, and other
 supplies, including two packets of medicine.
 In the early morning hours of July 4, 1963,
 his group started its journey from the Xuan
 Mat training center outside Hanoi.  The con-
 voy of six Molotov trucks moved south along
 Highway 21 to Nghe An Province and then
 on to Quang Binh.  On July 7 they arrived
 at the final processing station near the Laos-
 North Vietnam border.  There they turned
 in their North Vietnamese Army uniforms
 as well as all personal papers and anything
 else that might identify them as coming from
 the north.  But their departure for the south
 was delayed for several weeks.  In August
 they set off through Laos.
 Twice along the way Linh had to stop at
 liaison stations because of illness. When the
 infiltrators recovered  from  their  illnesses,
 they were formed into special groups to con-
 tinue their penetration into South Vietnam.
 Linh reported being delayed once for 8 days,
 and the second time for 10 days.
 Finally, in the first week of November 1963,
 Linh was sufficiently recovered to begin the
 final leg of his journey to a VC center where
 he was to be assigned to a combat unit.  He
 and three others who had been similarly de-
 layed by attacks of malaria and other sickness
 made up a group.  They moved through the
 jungles of Quang Due Province near the Cam-
 bodian border.  On the morning of Novem-
 ber 9 they crossed the Srepok River.  There
 they ran into a unit of the South Vietnamese
 Army.  One of the infiltrators was killed,
 Linh was taken prisoner, and the other two
 Vietcong escaped.
 These are typical Vietcong.   There are
 many other officers like Tran Quoc Dan, tech-
 nicians like Nguyen Thao, and simple sol-
 diers like Nguyen True.  They were born in
 South Vietnam, fought against the French,
 and then went north and served in the army
 of North Vietnam. They were ordered by the
 Communist rulers in Hanoi to reenter South
 Vietnam. Violating the Geneva accords of

 1954 and 1962, they used the territory of
 neighboring Laos to infiltrate into the South.
 They are the means by which Communist
 North Vietnam is carrying out its program
 of conquest in South Vietnam ..9
 0. Infiltration of native North Vietnamese
 The Communist authorities in Hanoi are
 now assigning native North Vietnamese in
 increasing numbers to join the VC forces
 in South  Vietnam.  Heretofore, those  in
 charge of the infiltration effort have sought
 to fill their quotas with soldiers and others
 born in the south.  The 90,000 troops that
 moved from South Vietnam to the north
 when the Geneva accords ended the Indo-
 china War have provided an invaluable res-
 ervoir for this purpose.  Now, apparently,
 that source is running dry.  The casualty
 rate has been high, and obviously many of
 those who were in fighting trim 10 years
 ago are no longer up to the rigors of guer-
 rilla war.
 In any case, reports of infiltration by na-
 tive North Vietnamese in significant num-
 bers have been received in Saigon for several
 months.  It is estimated that as many as
 75 percent of the more than 4,400 Vietcong
 who are known to have entered the south
 in the first 8 months of 1964 were natives
 of North Vietnam.
 Vo Thanh Vinh was born in Nghe An Prov-
 ince in North Vietnam in 1936.  He was cap-
 tured by South Vietnamese forces on May 5,
 1964.  He described himself as a military
 security officer.  He infiltrated into South
 Vietnam in April 1964 with a group of 34
 police and security officers from the north.
 Another native North Vietnamese captured
 in the south was VC Pfc. Vo Quyen.  His
 home was in Nam Dinh Province.  He was a
 member of the 2d Battalion of the North
 Vietnamese Army's 9th Regiment. He said
 the entire battalion had infiltrated into
 South Vietnam between February and May
 last year.  He was captured in an action in
 Quang Tri Province on July 4.  He told in-
 terrogators that the bulk of his unit was
 composed of young  draftees from North
 Vietnam.
 Le Pham Hung, also a private, first class,
 was captured on July 7 in Thua Thien
 Province:  He is a native of Nam Dinh in
 North Vietnam.  Drafted for military service
 in May 1963, he was in the 324th Division.
 His group, consisting solely of 90 North
 Vietnamese draftees, infiltrated into South
 Vietnam in May 1964.  He reported that an-
 other company of the North Vietnamese
 entered the south at the same time as his
 unit.
 A former member of the 90th VC Battal-
 ion reported that his unit had been rein-
 forced by native North Vietnamese troops
 earlier this year.  Le Thua Phuong, an in-
 8 See app. C for additional details on mili-
 tary infiltrators.

 formation cadre and a native of Quang Ngai
 Province in the south, surrendered to Gov-
 ernment forces on April 23, 1964.  He said
 that the  90th Battalion had received 80
 North Vietnamese replacements in February.
 A medical technician named Hoang Thung
 was captured in Thua Thien Province on
 July 4, 1964.  He said he had infiltrated into
 the south in late 1963 with a group of 200
 Vietcong, the majority of whom were ethnic
 northerners, 120 of them draftees.
 These reports destroy one more fiction
 which the authorities in Hanoi have sought
 so long to promote-that the fighting in the
 south was a matter for the South Viet-
 namese.  They underline Hanoi's determina-
 tion to press its campaign of conquest with
 every available resource.
 D. Infiltration of Vietcong agents
 No effort to subvert another nation as
 elaborate as that being conducted by the
 Ho Chi Minh regime against South Vietnam
 can succeed without an intelligence-gather-
 ing organization.  Recognizing this, the au-
 thorities in Hanoi have developed an exten-
 sive espionage effort.  An essential part of
 that effort is the regular assignment of secret
 agents from the north to South Vietnam.
 The heart of the VC intelligence organiza-
 tion is the Central Research Agency in Hanoi.
 (See sec. IV, C.)   Communist agents are
 regularly dispatched from North Vietnam,
 sometimes for brief assignments but often
 for long periods.  Many of these agents move
 into South Vietnam along the infiltration
 trails through Laos; others are carried by
 boats along the coasts and landed at pre-
 arranged sites.                                                                                                A special maritime infiltra-
 tion group has been developed in North Viet-
 nam, with its operations centered in Ha
 Tinh and Quang Binh Provinces just north
 of the 17th parallel.
 1. Maritime Infiltration
 The following case illustrates the methods
 of maritime  infiltration of secret agents
 used by the Communist regime of North
 Vietnam.
 in July 1962 a North Vietnamese intelli-
 gence agent named Nguyen Viet Duong be-
 gan training to infiltrate South Vietnam.  A
 native southerner, he had fought against the
 French and had gone to North Vietnam after
 the war ended.   Selected for intelligence
 work, he was assigned to the Central Re-
 search Agency in 1959.
 After a period of intensive instruction in
 radio transmission, coding and decoding, and
 other skills of the intelligence trade, he was
 given false identity papers and other sup-
 plies and was transported to the south.  His
 principal task was to set up a cell of agents
 to collect military information.  He flew
 from Hanoi to Dong Hot., and from there the
 Maritime infiltration group took him by boat
 to South Vietnam. That was in August 1962.
 In January 1963 Duong reported to Hanoi
 that he had run into difficulties.  His money

 and papers had been lost, and lie had been
 forced to take refuge with VC contacts in an-
 other province.  Another agent was selected
 to go to South Vietnam.  One of his assign-
 ments was to contact Duong, find out details
 of what happened to him, and help Duong
 reestablish himself as a VC agent.  The man
 selected for the task was Senor Captain
 Tran Van  Tan  of  the   Central    Research
 Agency.
 Tan had already been picked to go to the
 South to establish a clandestine VC commu-
 nications center.                                            Making contact with Du-
 ong was one of his secondary assignments.
 After intensive preparations Tan was ready
 to move to South Vietnam in March.  He
 was transferred to an embarkation base of
 the maritime infiltration group just north
 of the 17th parallel.
 He was joined by three other VC agents
 and the captain and three crewmen of the
 boat that would take them south.  All were
 given false identity papers to conform to
 their false names.  They also were provided
 with fishermen's permits, South Vietnamese
 voting cards, and draft cards or military dis-
 charge papers.  The boat captain received a
 boat registration book, crew lists, and sev-
 eral South Vietnamese permits to conduct
 business.
 The  agents and  boatmen  were  given
 cover stories to tell if captured.  Each man
 had to memorize not only the details of his
 own story but the names and some details
 about each of the others.  The agents had
 to become familiar with simple boat proce-
 dures so they could pass as legitimate fisher-
 men.
 The expedition left the embarkation port
 on April 4.  In addition to the four agents
 the boat carried six carefully sealed boxes
 containing a generator, several radios, some
 weapons, and a large supply of South Viet-
 namese currency.  They also carried some
 chemicals and materials for making false
 identification papers.  Their destination was
 a landing site on the coast of Phuoc Tuy
 Province.
 Soon after leaving North Vietnam the VC
 boat encountered high winds and rough seas.
 On April 7 the storm became violent.  The
 boat  tossed  and  threatened  to capsize.
 Strong northeasterly winds forced it ever
 closer to shore.  Finally the boat captain,
 Nguyen Xit, ordered that the six boxes be
 thrown overboard.    This was done, and the
 boat then was beached.  The eight men de-
 cided to split up into pairs and try to make
 contact with VC forces. They buried their
 false papers and set out.  Six of the eight
 were captured almost immediately by au-
 thorities in Thua mien Province, and the
 other two were taken several days later,
 2. Student Propaganda Agents
 The student population of South Vietnam
 is an important target group for VC propa-
 gandists.  These agents seek to win adher-
 ents for the Communist cause among young
 765-428-96923
 workers, students in high schools and uni-
 versities, and the younger officers and en-
 listed men in the armed forces of the Repub-
 lic of Vietnam.
 Typical of the agents sent into South
 Vietnam for this purpose is Nguyen Van Vy,
 a 19-year-old VC propagandist.  He is a
 native of the Vinh Linh District in North
 Vietnam, just north of the demilitarized
 zone.  He was a member of a Communist
 Party youth group in his native village.  He
 was recruited for propaganda work in the
 south in the fall of 1962.  He was one of 40
 young persons enrolled in a special political
 training course given by the Communist
 Party in his district.
 The first phase of the training consisted of
 political indoctrination covering such sub-
 jects as the advance of communism, the
 North Vietnamese plan for winning control
 of the country, the responsibility of youth
 in furthering this plan, the war in the south,
 and the need for propaganda supporting the
 Liberation Front.
 Those who successfully completed the first
 phase were selected for the second level of
 training,  the  so-called  technical  training
 phase.  In this the trainees were given their
 mission in the south. Vy was told he should
 infiltrate into South Vietnam and there sur-
 render to the authorities, describing himself
 as a defector who was "tired of the miserable
 life in the north."  He was to say he wanted
 to complete his schooling, which was impos-
 sible in the north.  He was told to ask to
 live with relatives in the south so he could
 go to school.  Once his story was accepted
 and he was enrolled in a school, he was to
 begin his work of propagandiizng other stu-
 dents.  He was to wait for 3 or 4 months,
 however, until he was no longer the subject
 of local suspicion.  He was assigned to work
 under an older agent to whom he had to
 report regularly.
 A third member of the team was a younger
 man who was to assist Vy.  The three were
 to infiltrate into South Vietnam separately
 and to meet there at a rendezvous point.
 At first Vy was to do no more than to
 observe his fellow students carefully, col-
 lecting biographical data on them and study-
 ing their personalities, capabilities, and as-
 pirations.. He was then to select those he
 thought might be most influenced by Com-
 munist propaganda and try to make friends
 with them.
 Once he had selected targets, he was to
 begin to influence them favorably toward the
 north and to implant Communist propa-
 ganda,  He was responsible then for bringing
 into his organization those he had influenced
 effectively.  These individuals were to be
 given their own propaganda assignments to
 work on other students.
 Students who  wanted to evade military
 service in the Government forces were con-
 sidered prime targets.  Where possible, Vy
 was to help them get to. North Vietnam.  He

 was also told to make contact with any stu-
 dents who had been picked up by the author-
 ities for suspected  Communist activities.
 These, too, were to be helped to escape to
 North Vietnam.   Any useful information
 concerning developments in  the south or
 military  activities were  to be  reported
 through his superior, Nguyen Van Phong.
 In case he became suspect, he was either
 to make his own way back to North Vietnam
 or to go into the jungle and try to contact
 a VC unit.
 Vy entered South Vietnam on January 2,
 1963, by swimming across the Ben Hal River.
 He encountered an elderly farmer who led
 him to the local authorities in Hai Gu.
 There he told his story but it was not be-
 lieved.  He then admitted his true mission.
 3. Other Agents
 The Communist authorities in North Viet-
 nam send their agents into South Vietnam
 by a wide variety of means.  A few like
 Nguyen Van Vy cross the demilitarized zone,
 more Infiltrate by sea, and still more along
 the infiltration routes through Laos.  But
 there are other methods for entering South
 Vietnam.  VC  espionage agent Tran Van
 But attempted one such method.
 But was a graduate of the espionage train-
 ing school in Haiphong, North Vietnam.                                       He
 completed a special 6-month course in July
 1962.  The training included political in-
 doctrination, but most of the time was spent
 on such things as use of weapons, preparing
 booby traps, and methods of sabotage.  He
 was also given instruction in methods for
 enlisting help from hoodlums, draft dodgers,
 and VC sympathizers.  Once in South Viet-
 nam, he was to organize a small unit for
 sabotage and the collection of Information.
 On specific assignment by his superiors he
 was to be ready to sabotage ships in Saigon
 harbor and to blow up gasoline and oil stor-
 age points and Vietnamese Army Installa-
 tions.  He was told to be prepared to assas-
 sinate Vietnamese officials and American per-
 sonnel.
 In September 1962 But was given his mis-
 sion assignment.  He was to hide aboard a
 foreign ship. When discovered, he was to
 claim to be a refugee who wanted to escape
 to South Vietnam.  He was given an auto-
 matic pistol with silencer, some explosive de-
 vices, and a small knife that could inject
 poison into the body of a victim.
 But stole aboard a foreign ship in Hai-
 phong harbor.  After 3 days at sea-when
 he  was  sure  the  ship  would  not  turn
 around-But surrendered to the ship's cap-
 tain.  When the ship arrived in Bangkok,
 But was turned over to the Thai authorities.
 They in turn released him to the South Viet-
 namese as he had requested.  But in Saigon
 his true mission was disclosed and he made
 a full confession.

 It. HANOI SUPPLIES WEAPONS, AMMUNITION, AND
 OTHER WAR MATERIEL TO ITS FORCES IN THE
 SOUTH
 When Hanoi launched the VC campaign of
 terror, violence, and subversion in earnest
 in 1959, the Communist forces relied mainly
 on stocks of weapons and ammunition left
 over from the war against the French.  Sup-
 plies sent in from North Vietnam came
 largely from the same source. As the military
 campaign progressed, the Vietcong depended
 heavily on weapons captured from the Armed
 Forces in South Vietnam.  This remains an
 important source of weapons and ammuni-
 tions for the Vietcong.  But as the pace of
 the war has quickened, requirements for up-
 to-date arms and special types of weapons
 have risen to a point where the Vietcong can-
 not rely on captured stocks.  Hanoi has
 undertaken a program to reequip its forces
 in  the  south  with  Communist-produced
 weapons.
 Large and Increasing quantities of mili-
 tary supplies are entering South Vietnam
 from outside the country.  The principal
 supply point is North Vietnam, which pro-
 vides a convenient channel for materiel that
 originates In Communist China and other
 Communist countries.
 An increasing number of weapons from
 external Communist sources have been seized
 in the south.  These include such weapons
 as 57-millimeter and 75-millimeter recoilless
 rifles, dual-purpose  machineguns,  rocket
 launchers, large mortars, and antitank mines.
 A new group of Chinese Communist-manu-
 factured weapons has recently appeared in
 VC hands.  These include the 7.62 semiauto-
 matic carbine, 7.62 light machinegun, and
 the 7.62 assault rifle.  These weapons and
 ammunition   for  them,  manufactured  in
 Communist China in 1962, were first cap-
 tured in December 1964 in Chuong Thien
 Province.  Similar weapons have since been
 seized in each of the four corps areas of
 South Vietnam. Also captured have been
 Chinese    Communist   antitank    grenade
 launchers and ammunition made in China
 in 1963.
 One captured Vietcong told his captors
 that his entire company had been supplied
 recently with modern Chinese weapons.  The
 reequipping of VC units with a type of weap-
 ons that require ammunition and parts from
 outside South Vietnam indicates the growing
 confidence of the authorities in Hanoi in the
 effectiveness of their supply lines into the
 south.
 Incontrovertible evidence of Hanoi's elabo-
 rate program to supply its forces in the south
 with weapons, ammunition, and other sup-
 plies has accumulated over the years.  Dra-
 matic new proof was exposed just as this re-
 port was being completed.
 On February 16, 1965, an American heli-
 copter pilot flying along the South     Viet-

 namese coast sighted a suspicious vessel.  It
 was a cargo ship of an estimated 100-ton
 capacity, carefully camouflaged and moored
 just offshore along the coast of Phu Yen
 Province.  Fighter planes that approached
 the vessel met machinegun fire from guns on
 the deck of the ship and from the shore
 as well.  A Vietnamese Air Force strike was
 launched against the vessel, and Vietnamese
 Government troops moved into the area.
 They seized the ship after a. bitter fight with
 the Vietcong.
 The ship, which had been sunk in shallow
 water, had discharged a huge cargo of arms,
 ammunition,  and  other  supplies.   Docu-
 ments found on the ship and on the bodies
 of several Vietcong aboard identified the ves-
 sel as having come from North Vietnam.                                            A
 newspaper in the cabin was from Haiphong
 and was dated January 23, 1065.  The sup-
 plies delivered by the ship-thousands of
 weapons and more than a million rounds of
 ammunition-were almost all of Communist
 origin, largely from Communist China and
 Czechoslovakia, as well as North Vietnam.
 At least 100 tons of military supplies were
 discovered near the ship.
 A preliminary survey of the cache near the
 sunken vessel from Hanoi listed the follow-
 ing supplies and weapons:
 Approximately 1 million rounds of small-
 arms ammunition;  more than 1,000 stick
 grenades; 500 pounds of TNT in prepared
 charges; 2,000 rounds of 82-millimeter mortar
 ammunition;  500 antitank grenades;  500
 rounds of 57-millimeter recoilless rifle am-
 munition; more than 1,000 rounds of 75-
 millimeter recoilless rifle ammunition; one
 57-millimeter recoilless rifle; 2 heavy ma-
 chineguns; 2,000 7.95 Mauser rifles;                                                 more
 than 100, 7.62 carbines; 1,000 submachine-
 guns; 15 light machineguns; 500 rifles; 500
 pounds of medical supplies (with labels from
 North Vietnam, Communist China, Czecho-
 slovakia, East Germany, Soviet Union, and
 other sources).
 The ship was fairly new and had been
 made  in  Communist  China.   Documents
 aboard the ship included three North Viet-
 namese nautical charts (one of the Hai-
 phong area and one of Hong Gay, both in
 North Vietnam, and one of the Tra Vinh area
 of South Vietnam).   The military health
 records of North Vietnamese soldiers were
 found. One man had a political history sheet
 showing he was a member of the 338th Di-
 vision of the North Vietnamese Army.  (See
 app. E.)
 Also abroad the North Vietnamese ship
 were:  an instruction book for a Chinese
 Communist navigational device; postcards
 and letters to addresses in North Vietnam;
 snapshots, including one of a group of men
 in North Vietnamese Army uniforms under a
 flag of the Hanoi government.
 Members of the ICC and representatives of
 the free press visited the sunken North Viet-
 namese ship and  viewed its cargo.  The
 765-428-96923
 incident itself underlined in the most drama-
 tic form that Hanoi is behind the continuing
 campaign of aggression aimed at conquer-
 ing South Vietnam.  it made unmistakably
 clear that what is happening in South Viet-
 nam is not an internal affair but part of a
 large-scale carefully directed and supported
 program of armed attack on a sovereign state
 and a free people.
 There have been previous seizures of large
 stocks  of ammunition and  weapons and
 other   military  supplies  that could  only
 have come from Communist sources outside
 South Vietnam.    In December 1963, a Re-
 public                                                                                                of Vietnam force attacked a       VC
 stronghold in Dinh Tuong Province south-
 west of Saigon.                                                                                               A large cache of VC equip-
 ment was seized.  Included in the captured
 stocks were the following weapons and am-
 munition, all of Chinese Communist manu-
 facture:
 One 90-millimeter rocket launcher; 2 car-
 bines (type 53); 120 rounds of 75-millimeter
 recoilless rifle ammunition; 120 detonating
 fuses for recoilless rifle ammunition; 14,000
 rounds of 7.62 (type P) ammunition; 160,000
 rounds of 7.62 carbine ammunition; 150 fuses
 for mortar shells;  100,000 rounds of 7.92
 Mauser-type ammunition; 110 pounds (ap-
 proximate) of TNT; two 60-millimeter mor-
 tars.
 These weapons and ammunition are the
 same as those used in the North Vietnamese
 Army.   Some of  the 7.62-millimeter am-
 munition was manufactured as recently as
 1962.
 Materiel is sent into South Vietnam from
 the North by a variety of methods-over-
 land, by river and canal, and by sea.  In one
 instance  Vietnamese  troops  discovered  a
 cache in which the 75-millimeter ammuni-
 tion alone weighed approximately 11/2 tons,
 It has been estimated that it would require
 more than 150 porters to carry this quantity
 of ammunition over rough terrain.      How-
 ever, a few sampans, each manned by a few
 men, could transport it with little difficulty.
 It is worth noting, in this connection, that
 the delta where the cache of materiel was
 seized has 460 miles of seacoast as well as
 2,500 miles of canals navigable by large water-
 craft and another 2,200 miles of canals over
 which sampans can move easily.  Much of
 the transport of large stocks of ammunition
 is undoubtedly waterborne for at least much
 of its travel into South Vietnam .5 '
 4 On Jan. 29, 1964, the Government of the
 Republic of Vietnam supplied the Inter-
 national Control Commission with a list of
 weapons, ammunition, and other equipment
 of Communist origin captured in South Viet-
 nam since June 1962.  The list is summar-
 ized in app. D.

 .  Large quantities of chemical components
 for explosives have been sent into South
 Vietnam for the  Vietcong.   During 1963
 there were at least 15 incidents in which
 boats, junks, or sampans were seized with
 explosives aboard. More than 20 tons of
 potassium chlorate or nitrate were captured.
 All these cases were in the delta area, and
 the majority were on or near the Mekong
 River.  Red phosphorus made in Communist
 China has been among the chemicals cap-
 tured from the Vietcong.
 The     Communists  have  shown  extreme
 sensitivity to exposure of the fact that war
 material is going to the Vietcong from North
 Vietnam, Communist China, and other Com-
 munist countries.  A secret document cap-
 tured from a VC agent last year reflected
 this sensitivity. The document was sent
 from VC military headquarters in Bien Hoa
 Province to subordinate units.  It ordered
 them to "pay special attention to the re-
 moval of all the markings and letters on
 weapons of all types currently employed
 by units and agencies and manufactured by
 friendly East European democratic countries
 or by China."  It said incriminating mark-
 ing should be chiseled off "so that the enemy
 cannot use it as a propaganda theme every
 time he captures these .weapons."
 III. NORTH VIETNAM:  BASE FOR CONQUEST OF
 THE   SOUTH
 The Third Lao Dong Party Congress in
 Hanoi in September 1960 set forth two tasks
 for its members: "to carry out the socialist
 revolution in North Vietnam" and "to lib-
 erate South Vietnam."
 The resolutions of the congress described
 the effort to destroy the legal Government
 in South Vietnam as follows: "The revolu-
 tion in the South is a protracted, hard, and
 complex process of struggle, combining many
 forms of struggle of great activity and flexi-
 bility, ranging from lower to higher, and
 taking as its basis the building, consolida-
 tion, and development of the revolutionary
 power of the masses."
 At the September meeting the Communist
 leaders in the north called for formation of
 "a  broad  national  united  front."  Three
 months later Hanoi announced creation of
 the "Front for Liberation of the South."
 This. Is the organization that Communist
 propaganda now credits with guiding the
 forces of subversion in the south; it is pie.
 tured as an organization established and run
 by the people in the south themselves.  At
 the 1960 Lao Dong Party Congress the tone
 was different.  Then, even before the front
 existed, the Communist leaders were issuing
 orders for the group that was being organized
 behind the scenes in Hanoi.  "This front
 must rally", "The aims of its struggle are";
 "The front must carry out"-this is the way
 Hanoi and the Communist Party addressed
 the Liberation Front even before its found-
 ing.
 The Liberation Front is Hanoi's creation;
 it is neither independent nor southern, and
 what it seeks is not liberation but subjuga-
 tion of the south.
 In his address to the Third Lao Dong Party
 Congress, party and government leader Ho
 Chi Minh spoke of the necessity "to step up
 the Socialist revolution in the north and,
 at the same time, to step up the national
 democratic people's revolution in the south."
 The year before, writing for Red Flag,
 the Communist Party newspaper of Belgium,
 Ho had said much the same thing: "We are
 building socialism in Vietnam, but we are
 building it in only one part of the country,
 while in the other part we still have to direct
 and bring to a close the middle-class demo-
 cratic and antiimperialist revolution."
 In the same vein, the commander in chief
 of the North Vietnamese armed forces, Vo
 Nguyen Giap, spoke at the 1960 party con-
 gress of the need to "step up the national
 democratic people's revolution in the south."
 Earlier in the year, writing for the Commu-
 nist Party journal Hoc Tap in Hanoi, General
 Giap described the north as "the revolution-
 ary base for the whole country."
 Le Duan, a member of the Politburo and
 first secretary of the Lao Dong Party, was even
 more explicit when he talked at the party
 congress about the struggle in the south and
 the party's role.  After noting the difficulties
 involved in overthrowing the existing order
 in South Vietnam, Le Duan said: "Hence the
 southern people's revolutionary struggle will
 be long, drawn out, and arduous.  It Is not a
 simple process but a complicated one, com-
 bining many varied forms of struggle-from
 elementary to advanced, legal and illegal-
 and based on the building, consolidation, and
 development of the revolutionary force of the
 masses.  In this process, we must constantly
 intensify our solidarity and the organization
 and education of the people of the south."
 Another high official of the Hanoi regime,
 Truong Chinh, writing in the party organ Hoc
 Tap in April 1961, expressed confidence in the
 success of the struggle to remove the legal
 government  in  South  Vietnam  because:
 "North Vietnam  is  being  rapidly  con-
 solidated and strengthened, is providing good
 support to the South Vietnamese revolution,
 and is serving as a strong base for the strug-
 gle for national reunification."
 He outlined the steps by which the Com-
 munists expect to achieve control over all
 Vietnam as follows: The Liberation Front
 would destroy the present Government in the
 south;  a coalition government would  be
 established;  this government would agree
 with the North Vietnamese government in
 Hanoi regarding national reunification un-
 der one form or another.  It takes little
 imagination to understand the form that is
 intended.
 "Thus,"  wrote  Truong  Chinh,  "though
 South Vietnam will be liberated by nonpeace-
 ful means, the party policy of achieving

 49
 peaceful national reunification is still cor-
 rect.'
 The official government radio in Hanoi is
 used both overtly and covertly to support
 the Vietcong effort in South Vietnam.  Cap-
 tured agents have testified that the broad-
 casts are used sometimes to send instructions
 in veiled code to Vietcong representatives in.
 the south.
 Hoc Tap stated frankly in March 1963:
 "They [the authorities in South Vietnam]
 are well aware that North Vietnam is the firm
 base for the southern revolution and the
 point on which it leans, and that our party
 is the steady and experienced vanguard unit
 of the working class and people and is the
 brain and factor that decides all victories of
 the revolution."
 In April 1964 the Central Committee of the
 Lao Dong Party issued a directive to all
 party echelons.  It stated: "When the forces
 of the enemy and the plots of the enemy are
 considered, it is realized that the cadres,
 party members, and people in North Viet-
 nam must * * * increase their sense of re-
 sponsibility in regard to the South Vietnam
 revolution by giving positive and practical
 support to South Vietnam in every field."
 Nguyen Chi Thanh, writing in a Hanoi
 newspaper in May 1963, underlined the im-
 portance of the role of the North Vietnamese
 Army in Hanoi's plans to unify Vietnam un-
 der Communist rule: "Our party set forth two
 strategic tasks to be carried out at the same
 time: to transform and build socialism in the
 north and to struggle to unify the country.
 Our army is an instrument of the class strug-
 gle in carrying out these two strategic tasks."
 IV.  ORGANIZATION,  DIRECTION,  COMMAND,  AND
 CONTROL OF THE ATTACK ON SOUTH VIETNAM
 ARE CENTERED IN HANOI
 The VC military and political apparatus
 in South Vietnam is an extension of an
 elaborate military and political structure in
 North Vietnam which directs and supplies
 it with the tools for conquest.  The He Chi
 Minh regime has shown that it is ready to
 allocate every resource that can be spared-
 whether it be personnel, funds, or equip-
 ment-to the cause of overthrowing the legit-
 imate Government in South Vietnam, and
 of bringing all Vietnam under Communist
 rule.
 A. Political organization
 Political direction and control of the Viet-
 cong is supplied by the Lao Dong Party, i.e.
 the Communist Party, led by Ho Chi Minh.
 Party agents are responsible for indoctrina-
 tion, recruitment, political training, propa-
 ganda,  anti-Government  demonstrations,
 and other activities of a political nature.
 The considerable intelligence-gathering fa-
 cilities of the party are also at the disposal
 of the Vietcong.
 Overall direction of the VC movement is
 the responsibility of the Central Committee
 of. the Lao Dong Party.  Within the central
 765-428-96923
 committee a special reunification depart-
 ment has been established. This has replaced
 the  committee  for  supervision  of  the
 south mentioned in intelligence reports 2
 years ago.  It lays down broad strategy for
 the movement to conquer South Vietnam.
 Until March 1962 there were two principal
 administrative divisions in the VC structure
 in the south.  One was the interzone of
 South-Central Vietnam  (sometimes called
 interzone 5); the other was the Nambo re-
 gion.  In a 1962 reorganization these were
 merged into one, called the central office for
 South Vietnam.   The  central  committee,
 through its reunification department, is-
 sues directives to the central office, which
 translates them into specific orders for the
 appropriate subordinate command.
 Under the central office are six regional
 units (V through IX) plus the special zone of
 Saigon/Cholon/Gia Dinh.  A regional com-
 mittee responsible to the central office directs
 VC activities in each region.  Each regional
 committee has specialized units responsible
 for liaison, propaganda, training, personnel,
 subversive  activities,  espionage,  military
 bases, and the like.
 Below each regional committee are simi-
 larly structured units at the province and
 district levels.  At the base of the Com-
 munist pyramid are the individual party
 cells, which may be organized on a geographic
 base or within social or occupational groups.
 The elaborateness of the party unit and the
 extent to which it operates openly or under-
 ground is determined mainly by the extent
 of VC control over the area concerned.
 1. The  Liberation Front:  The  National
 Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam
 is the screen behind which the Communists
 carry out their program of conquest.  It is
 the creature of the Communist Government
 in Hanoi.  As noted above the Communist
 Party in the North demanded establishment
 of such a front 3 months before its forma-
 tion was actually announced in December
 1960.  It was designed to create the illusion
 that the Vietcong campaign of subversion
 was  truly  indigenous  to  South  Vietnam
 rather than an externally directed Commu-
 nist plan.
 The front has won support primarily from
 the Communist world.    Its radio faithfully
 repeats the propaganda themes of Hanoi and
 Peiping.   When  its representatives travel
 abroad, they do so with North Vietnamese
 passports and sponsorship .6 The front's pro-
 gram copies that of the Lao Dong Party in
 North Vietnam.
 In late 1961, in still another effort to con-
 ceal the extent of Communist domination
 of the front, the Communists announced
 formation of a new Marxist political unit,
 the  People's Revolutionary  Party  (PRP).

 This mechanism provided a way to explain
 the Communist presence in the front while
 at the same time making it appear that the
 Communist voice was only one of several
 affiliated organizations in the front.  The
 PRP itself claimed direct descent from the
 original Indochinese Communist Party and
 from  the  North  Vietnamese      Communist
 Party in Hanoi?  .
 B. Military organization
 Military affairs of the Vietcong are the
 responsibility of high command of the Peo-
 ple's Army of North Vietnam and the Min-
 istry of Defense, under close supervision from
 the Lao Dong Party.  These responsibilities
 include operational plans, assignments of
 individuals and regular units, training pro-
 grams, infiltration of military personnel and
 supplies, military communications, tactical
 intelligence, supplies, and the like.  The six
 military regions are the same as those of
 the VC political organization.
 The military structure of the Vietcong is
 an integral part of the political machinery
 that controls every facet of VC activity in
 South Vietnam under Hanoi's overall direc-
 tion.  Each political headquarters from the
 central office down to the village has a mili-
 tary component which controls day-to-day
 military operations.  Similarly, each mili-
 tary headquarters has a political element, an
 individual or a small staff.  This meshing
 of political and military activity is designed
 to insure the closest cooperation in support
 of the total Communist mission.  It also
 gives assurance of political control over the
 military.
 Associated with the central office, believed
 to be located in Tay Ninh Province, is a mili-
 tary headquarters.  Through this headquar-
 ters, as well as through other channels, Hanoi
 maintains direct contact with its principal
 military units in the south.
 In addition to its supervision of the gen-
 eral military effort of the VC, the military
 section of the central office is believed to
 have  direct command  of two regimental
 headquarters and a number of security com-
 panies.
 The hard core of the VC military organiza-
 tion is the full-time regular unit usually
 based on a province or region.  These are
 well-trained and highly disciplined guerrilla
 fighters.  They follow a rigid training sched-
 ule that is roughly two-thirds military and
 one-third political in content. This com-
 pares with the 50-50 proportion for district
 units and the 70 percent political and 30
 percent military content of the village guer-
 rilla's training.
 The size of the Vietcong regular forces has
 grown steadily in recent years.  For exam-

 tionary Party in the south and the Com-
 munist Lao Dong Party in the north are one
 party, see app. G.

 ple, the Vietcong have five regimental head-
 quarters compared with two in 1961.  And
 the main VC force is composed of 50 battal-
 ions, 50 percent more than before. There
 are an estimated 139. VC companies. Hard-
 core VC strength now is estimated at about
 35,000, whereas it was less than 20,000 in
 1961.
 The main force battalions are well armed
 with a variety of effective weapons includ-
 ing 75-millimeter recoilless rifles and 81-82-
 millimeter  mortars.  The  companies  and
 smaller units are equally well equipped and
 have 57-millimeter recoilless rifles and 60-
 millimeter mortars in their inventory. It is
 estimated that the Vietcong have at least
 130 81-millimeter mortars and 300 60-milli-
 meter mortars.  There is no precise estimate
 for the number of recoilless rifles in their
 hands, but it is believed that most main
 force units are equipped with them.  In at
 least one recent action the Vietcong em-
 ployed a 75-millimeter pack howitzer.  This
 mobile weapon, which has a range of 8,500
 yards, will increase the Vietcong capabilities
 to launch long-range attacks against many
 stationary targets in the country.
 Supporting the main force units of the
 Vietcong are an estimated 60,000-80,000 part-
 time guerrillas.  They are generally orga-
 nized at the district level where there are
 likely to be several companies of 50 or more
 men each.  These troops receive only half
 pay, which means they must work at least
 part of the time to eke out a living.
 Below the irregular guerrilla forces of the
 district are the part-time, village-based guer-
 rillas.
 They are available for assignment by higher
 headquarters and are used for harassment
 and sabotage.  They are expected to warn
 nearby VC units of the approach of any force
 of the legal government.  They provide a
 pool for recruitment into the VC district
 forces.
 The record shows that many of the village
 guerrillas are dragooned into service with
 the Vietcong.  Some are kidnapped; others
 are threatened; still others join to prevent
 their families from being harmed.  Once in
 the Vietcong net, many are reluctant to leave
 for fear of punishment by the authorities or
 reprisal by the Communists.
 Lam Van Chuoi is a typical example.  He
 was a member of the village civil defense
 force in his home village in Kien Giang pro-
 vince.                                                                                   In March 1960, he was kidnaped by
 the Vietcong and kept a prisoner in the
 highlands for 1 month.  There he was sub-
 jected to intense propaganda and indoc-
 trination. He was returned to his village but
 kept under close  observation and steady
 pressure. Finally, he was convinced he must
 join the VC.  Later, he was transferred to
 a Communist military unit in another pro-
 vince.  After learning of the Government's
 open arms program, he decided to defect
 from the VC.  In May 1964, he walked into

 a Government outpost and asked for protec-
 tion.
 Money to pay the regular VC units comes
 from a variety of sources.  Funds are sent
 from Hanoi.  "Taxes" are extorted from the
 local population.  Landowners and planta-
 tion operators often must pay a tribute to
 the VC as the price for not having their lands
 devastated.  Similarly, transportation com-
 panies have been forced to pay the VC or
 face the threat of having their buses or boats
 sabotaged.   Officials and wealthy people have
 been kidnaped for ransom.  The VC have
 often stopped buses and taken the money
 and valuables of all on board.
 For the most part, the VC have concen-
 trated their attention on individuals, iso-
 lated or poorly defended outposts, and small
 centers of population.  They have mercilessly
 killed or kidnaped thousand of village chiefs
 and other local officials.  But over the past
 year the VC have moved into larger unit
 operations.  Their ability to operate on a
 battalion level or larger has substantially
 increased.
 C. Intelligence organization
 A key element in the Vietcong effort is an
 elaborate organization in Hanoi called the
 Central Research Agency (CRA) (Cue Nghi-
 en-Cuu Trung-tlong).  Though it handles
 Hanoi's intellience effort on a worldwide
 scale, the main focus of its operation is on
 South Vietnam,  This agency is able to draw
 on the intelligence capabilities of both the
 Lao Dong Party and the North Vietnamese
 armed forces for information, personnel, and
 facilities.
 The CRA reportedly operates under the
 close personal scrutiny of Ho Chi Minh him-
 self.  Some of the top officials in the Hanoi
 government reportedly sit on its directing
 committee,  including  Premier  Pham  Van
 Dong, Deputy Premier Truong Chinh, and
 Defense Minster Vo Nguyen Giap.
 Considerable information on the organiza-
 tion of the CRA has become available from
 captured Vietcong agents and from the work
 of intelligence agents of the Republic of
 Vietnam.  Much of this information cannot
 be made public for security reasons, but it
 is possible to describe the CRA organization
 and its operations in broad outline.
 The headquarters of the CRA in Hanoi is
 divided into six main sections, not including
 a special code unit.  The six sections are re-
 sponsible for administration, cadres, com-
 munications, espionage, research, and train-
 ing.  Each section has units to handle the
 specialized activities of its particular area of
 responsibility.  The research section, for ex-
 ample, has subsections that handle political,
 economic, and military affairs respectively.
 CRA headquarters directs a number of
 special centers for oversea operations.  One
 such center maintains intelligence channels
 to oversea areas.  It operates through spe-
 cial units at Haiphong and at Hon gay.
 765-428-96923
 A second special center is responsible for
 VC intelligence operations in Cambodia and
 Laos. A third center handles activities along
 the "demarcation line," the border with
 South Vietnam.  This unit, based in Vinh
 Linh in southeast North Vietnam, is respon-
 sible for sending agents and supplies to the
 south by sea.  It also cooperates with the
 North Vietnamese army in planning and
 carrying out infiltration.  The CRA main-
 tains intelligence bases in Laos and other
 countries.
 Inside South Vietnam the Vietcong have a
 large intelligence network. Some of its units
 are responsible for receiving and sending on
 agents arriving from the North.  They feed
 and give instructions to groups infiltrating
 into South Vietnam.  They take delivery of
 equipment and supplies received from the
 North and relay them to Vietcong units in
 the south.
 Many Vietcong agents have been captured
 in Saigon.  They have exposed the extensive
 effort by the CRA to penetrate all Republic
 of Vietnam Government agencies, foreign
 embassies, and other specialized organiza-
 tions.  Party and military intelligence units
 and agents work closely with the CRA.
 Each of the main centers operating under
 CRA headquarters has its own sections and
 units designed to carry out its main func-
 tions.  The center at Vinh Linh, responsible
 for the main infiltration effort of the Viet-
 cong, has separate sections for radio com-
 munications,  coding,  documentation  and
 training, and liaison.  It also has specialized
 units for infiltration through the moun-
 tains, infiltration by sea, and "illegal action"
 in the mountain area.
 The CRA maintains a large and expanding
 radio communications network.  Agents also
 are used to carry messages, usually in secret
 writing or memorized.
 Taken as a whole, the North Vietnamese
 intelligence operation  in  support of  the
 Vietcong is one of the most extensive of its
 kind in the world .B
 V. A BRIEF HISTORY  OF HANOI'S CAMPAIGN OF
 AGGRESSION AGAINST SOUTH VIETNAM
 While negotiating an end to the Indochina
 war at Geneva in 1954, the Communists were
 making plans to take over all former French
 territory in southeast Asia.  When Vietnam
 was partitioned, thousands of carefully se-
 lected party members were ordered to remain
 in place in the south and keep their secret
 apparatus intact to help promote Hanoi's
 cause.  Arms and ammunition were stored
 away for future use.  Guerrilla fighters re-
 joined their families to await the party's call.
 Others  withdrew  to  remote  jungle  and
 mountain hideouts.  The majority, an esti-
 mated 90,000, were moved to North Vietnam.

 Hanoi's original calculation was that all
 of Vietnam would fall under its control with-
 out resort to force.  For this purpose, Com-
 munist cadres were ordered to penetrate offi-
 cial and nonofficial agencies, to propagandize
 and sow confusion, and generally to use all
 means short of open violence to aggravate
 war-torn conditions and to weaken South
 Vietnam's government and social fabric.
 South Vietnam's refusal to fall in with
 Hanoi's scheme for peaceful takeover came
 as a heavy blow to the Communists.  Mean-
 time, the Government had stepped up ef-
 forts to blunt Vietcong subversion and to
 expose Communist agents.  Morale in the
 Communist  organization  in  the    south
 dropped sharply. Defections were numerous.
 Among South Vietnamese, hope rose that
 their nation could have a peaceful and inde-
 pendent future, free of Communist domina-
 tion.                               The country went to work.  The years
 after 1955 were a period of steady progress
 and growing prosperity.
 Food production levels of the prewar years
 were reached and surpassed.  While per cap-
 ita food output was dropping 10 percent in
 the north from 1956 to 1960, it rose 20 per-
 cent in the south.  By 1963 it had risen 30
 percent, despite the disruption in the coun-
 tryside caused by intensified Vietcong mili-
 tary attacks and terrorism.  The authorities
 in the north admitted openly to continuing
 annual failures to achieve food production
 goals.
 Production of textiles increased in the
 south  more  that  20  percent  in  1  year
 (1958). In the same year, South Vietnam's
 sugar crop increased more than 100 percent.
 Despite North Vietnam's vastly larger indus-
 trial complex, South Vietnam's per capita
 gross national product in 1960 was estimated
 at $110 a person while it was only $70 in the
 North.
 More than 900,000 refugees who had fled
 from Communist rule in the North were suc-
 cessfully  settled in  South Vietnam.   An
 agrarian reform  program  was instituted.
 The elementary school  population nearly
 quadrupled between 1956 and 1960. And
 so it went-a record of steady improvement
 In the lives of the people. It was intolerable
 for the rulers in Hanoi; under peaceful con-
 ditions,                               the  south  was        outstripping the
 north. They were losing the battle of peace-
 ful competition and decided to use violence
 and terror to, gain their ends.
 After 1956 Hanoi rebuilt, reorganized, and
 expanded its covert political and military
 machinery in the South.  Defectors were
 replaced by trained personnel from party
 ranks in the north. Military units and polit-
 ical cells were enlarged and were given new
 leaders, equipment, and intensified training.
 Recruitment was pushed.  In short, Hanoi
 and its forces in the South prepared to take
 by force and violence what they had failed
 to achieve by other means.
 765-428-96923
 By 1958 the use of terror by the Vietcong
 increased appreciably.  It was used both to
 win prestige and to back up demands for
 support from the people, support that poli-
 tical and propaganda appeals had failed to
 produce.  It was also designed to embarrass.
 the Government in Saigon and raise doubts
 about its ability to maintain internal order
 and to assure the personal security of its
 people.  From 1959 through.1961, the pace.
 of Vietcong terrorism and armed. attacks ac-
 celerated substantially.
 The situation at the end of 1961 was so
 grave that the Government of the Republic.
 of Vietnam asked the United States for in-
 creased military assistance.  That request
 was met.  Meantime, the program of stra-
 tegic hamlets, designed to improve the peas-
 ant's livelihood and give him some protec-
 tion against Vietcong harassment and pres-
 sure, was pushed energetically.
 But the Vietcong did not stand still.  To
 meet the changing, situation, they tightened
 their organization and adopted new tactics,
 with increasing emphasis on terrorism, sabo-
 tage, and armed attacks by small groups.
 They also introduced from the North tech-
 nicians in fields such as armor and anti-
 aircraft. Heavier weapons were sent in to the
 regular guerrilla forces..
 The military and insurgency situation was
 complicated by a quite separate internal po-
 litical struggle in South Vietnam, which led
 in November 1963 to the removal of the
 Diem government and its replacement with
 a new one.  Effective power was placed in
 the hands of a Military Revolutionary Coun-
 cil. There have been a number of changes in
 the leadership and composition of the Gov-
 ernment in Saigon in the ensuing period.
 These internal developments and distrac-
 tions gave the Vietcong an invaluable op-
 portunity, and they took advantage of it.
 Vietcong agents did what they could to en-
 courage disaffection and to exploit demon-
 strations in Saigon and elsewhere.  In the
 countryside  the  Communists  consolidated
 their hold over some areas and enlarged their
 military and political apparatus by increased
 infiltration. Increasingly they struck at re-
 mote outposts and the most vulnerable of
 the new strategic hamlets and expanded their
 campaign of aggressive attacks, sabotage,
 and terror.
 Any official, worker, or establishment that
 represents a service to the people by the Gov-
 ernment in Saigon is fair game for the Viet-
 cong.  Schools have been among their favor-
 ite targets.  Through harassment, the mur-
 der of teachers, and sabotage of buildings,
 the Vietcong succeeded in closing hundreds
 of schools and interrupting the education
 of tens of thousands of youngsters.
 Hospitals and medical clinics have often
 been attacked as part of the anti-Govern-
 ment campaign and also because such at-
 tacks provide the Vietcong with needed med-

 ical supplies.  The Communists have en-
 couraged people in rural areas to oppose the
 Government's antimalaria. teams, and some
 of the workers have been killed.  Village and
 town offices, police stations, and agricultural
 research stations are high on the list of pre-
 ferred targets for the Vietcong.
 In  1964, 436 South Vietnamese hamlet
 chiefs and other Government officials were
 killed outright by the Vietcong and 1,131
 were kidnaped.  More than 1,350 civilians
 were killed in bombings and other acts of
 sabotage.  And at least 8,400? civilians were
 kidnaped by the Vietcong.9
 Today the war in Vietnam has reached new
 levels of intensity.  The elaborate effort by
 the Communist regime in North Vietnam to
 conquer the South has grown, not dimin-
 ished.  Military men, technicians, political
 organizers, propagandists, and secret agents
 have been infiltrating into the Republic of
 Vietnam from the north in growing num-
 bers.                                      The flow  of  Communist-supplied
 weapons, particularly those of large caliber,
 has increased.  Communications links with
 Hanoi are  extensive., Despite  the  heavy
 casualties of 3 years of fighting, the hard-
 core VC force is considerably larger now than
 it was at the end of 1961.
 The Government in Saigon has undertaken
 vigorous action to meet the new threat. The
 United States and other free countries have
 increased their assistance to the Vietnamese
 Government and people.  Secretary of State
 Dean Rusk visited Vietnam in 1964, and he
 promised the Vietnamese: "We shall remain
 at your side until the aggression from the
 north has been defeated, until it has been
 completely rooted out and this land enjoys
 the peace which it deserves."
 President Johnson has repeatedly stressed
 that the U.S. goal is to see peace secured in
 southeast Asia.  But he has noted that "that
 will come only when aggressors leave their
 neighbors in peace."
 Though it has been apparent for years that
 the regime in Hanoi was conducting a cam-
 paign of conquest against South Vietnam,
 the Government in Saigon and the Govern-
 ment of the United States both hoped that
 the danger could be met within South Viet-
 nam itself.  The hope that any widening of
 the conflict might be avoided was stated
 frequently.
 The leaders in Hanoi chose to respond with
 greater  violence.  They  apparently  inter-
 preted restraint as indicating lack of will.
 Their efforts were pressed with greater vigor
 and armed attacks and incidents of terror
 multiplied.
 Clearly the restraint of the past was not
 providing  adequately for  the  defense  of
 South Vietnam against Hanoi's open ag-
 gression.                                                 It was mutually agreed between
 the Governments of the Republic of Viet-

 nam and the United States that further
 means for providing for South Vietnam's
 defense were required.  Therefore, air strikes
 have been made against some of the mili-
 tary assembly points and supply bases from
 which North Vietnam is conducting its ag-
 gression against the South.  These strikes
 constitute a limited response fitted to the
 aggression that produced them.
 Until the regime in Hanoi decides to halt
 its intervention in the South, or until effec-
 tive steps are taken to maintain peace and
 security in the area, the Governments of
 South Vietnam and the United States will
 continue  necessary  measures  of  defense
 against the Communist armed aggression
 coming from North Vietnam.
 VI. CONCLUSION
 The evidence presented in this report could
 be multiplied many times with similar ex-
 amples of the drive of the Hanoi regime
 to extend its rule over South Vietnam.
 The record is conclusive.  It establishes
 beyond question that North Vietnam is carry-
 ing out a carefully conceived plan of ag-
 gression against the South.                                                                                                It shows that
 North Vietnam has intensified its efforts in
 the years since it was condemned by the In-
 ternational Control Commission.  It proves
 that Hanoi continues to press its systematic
 program of armed aggression into South
 Vietnam.  This   aggression   violates   the
 United Nations Charter.  It is directly con-
 trary to the Geneva Accords of 1954 and of
 1962 to which North Vietnam is a party.   It
 shatters the peace of southeast Asia.  It is a
 fundamental threat to the freedom and se-
 curity of South Vietnam.
 The people of South Vietnam have chosen
 to resist this threat.  At their request, the
 United States has taken its place beside them
 In their defensive struggle.
 The United States seeks no territory, no
 military bases, no favored position.  But we
 have learned the meaning of aggression else-
 where In the postwar world, and we have
 met it.
 If peace can be restored in South Vietnam,
 the United States will be ready at once to
 reduce its military involvement.  But it will
 not abandon friends who want to remain
 free.  It will do what must be.done to help
 them.  The choice now between peace and
 continued and increasingly destructive con-
 flict is one for the authorities in Hanoi to
 make.

 FINDINGS  OF  THE  INTERNATIONAL  CONTROL
 COMMISSION
 On June 2, 1962, the International Com-
 mission for Supervision and Control in Viet-
 nam (ICC) sent a special report to the Gov-
 ernments of the United Kingdom and of the
 Soviet Union in their role as cochairmen of
 the Geneva Conference on Indochina.  The
 ICO is composed of delegates from India
 (chairman), Canada, and Poland.

 In its report the ICC noted the following
 finding of the Commission's Legal Commit-
 tee:
 "Having examined the complaints and the
 supporting material sent by the South Viet-
 namese mission, the committee has come to
 the conclusion that in specific instances
 there is evidence to show that armed and
 unarmed personnel, arms, munitions, and
 other supplies have been sent from the zone
 in the north to the zone in the south with
 the object of supporting, organizing, and
 carrying  out  hostile  activities,  including
 armed attacks, directed against the Armed
 Forces and administration of the zone in the
 south.  These acts are in violation of articles
 10, 19, 24, and 27 of the agreement on the
 cessation of hostilities in Vietnam.
 "In examining the complaints and the sup-
 porting material in particular documentary
 material sent by the South Vietnamese mis-
 sion, the Committee has come to the further
 conclusion that there is evidence to show
 that the PAVN (people's army of Vietnam)
 has allowed the zone in the north to be used
 for inciting, encouraging and supporting the
 hostile activities in the zone in the south,
 aimed at the overthrow of the administration
 in the south.  The use of the zone in the
 north for such activities is in violation of
 articles 19, 24, and 27 of the agreement on
 the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam.
 The ICC report then stated:
 "The Commission accepts the conclusions
 reached by the Legal Committee that there
 is sufficient evidence to show beyond reason-
 able doubt that the PAVN has violated arti-
 cles 10, 19, 24, and 27 in specific instances.
 The Polish delegation dissents from these
 conclusions.  On the basis of the fuller re-
 port, that is being prepared by the Legal
 Committee covering all the allegations and
 incidents, the Commission will take action
 as appropriate in each individual case."

 APPENDIX D
 LIST  OP  COMMUNIST WEAPONS  CAPTURED IN
 SOUTH VIETNAM
 (See sec. II.)
 On January 29, 1964, the Government of
 Vietnam      submitted                                          to  the International
 Control Commission a list of weapons and
 other military equipment which had been
 captured from the Vietcong.      The weapons
 and  equipment                                            came  from Communist
 sources outside South Vietnam and obvious-
 ly had been introduced clandestinely into
 the country in support of the Vietcong cam-
 paign of conquest directed by Hanoi.

 APPENDIX E
 PHOTOS OF CAPTURED VIETCONG WEAPONS AND
 AMMUNITION FROM EXTERNAL COMMUNIST
 SOURCES
 (See sec. II.)
 The following are photographs of some of
 the many weapons and the large stocks of
 ammunition supplied to the Vietcong in
 South Vietnam from external Communist
 sources (not printed in the RECORD).
 APPENDIX F
 NORTH  VIETNAMESES PASSPORTS  AND       TRAVEL
 DOCUMENTS   USED  BY LIBERATION        FRONT
 OFFICIALS
 (See sec. IV, A, 1.)
 Huynh Van Nghia and Nguyen Van Tien
 are  officials  of  the  "National  Liberation
 Front of South Vietnam." Though they pro-
 fess to be citizens of South Vietnam, their
 ties are with and their support comes from
 North Vietnam and the Communist regime
 in   Hanoi.  In  1963,   when  the         two men
 traveled  abroad on      front business,  they
 traveled as North Vietnamese with passports
 and other documents issued by the Hanoi
 regime.
 Photographs    Of these documents follow
 (not printed in the RECORD).
 APPENDIX G
 THE PEOPLE'S REVOLUTIONARY PARTY (SOUTH)
 AND  THE  LAO  DONG  PARTY  (NORTH)  ARE
 ONE COMMUNIST PARTY
 (See sec. IV, A.)
 In May 1962 a military force of the Gov-
 ernment of Vietnam captured a number of
 Vietcong documents in Ba Xuyen Province.
 One of these documents contained instruc-
 tions from the provincial committee of the
 Lao Dong Party (Communist Party) in Ba
 Xuyen to the party's district committees con-
 cerning formation of the new People's Revo-
 lutionary Party (PRP).
 Pertinent sections of the instruction, dated
 December 7, 1961, follow:
 "To D2 and K:
 "In regard to the foundation of the People's
 Revolutionary Party of South Vietnam, the
 creation of this party is only a matter of
 strategy; it needs to be explained within the
 party; and, to deceive the enemy, it is neces-
 sary that the new party be given the outward
 appearance corresponding to a division of
 the party (Lao Dong) into two and the foun-
 dation of a new party, so that the enemy
 cannot use it in his propaganda.
 "Within the party, it is necessary to ex-
 plain that the founding of the People's Revo-
 lutionary Party has the purpose of isolating
 the Americans and the Ngo Dinh Diem re-
 gime, and to counter their accusations of an
 invasion of the South by the North.  It is
 means of supporting our sabotage of the
 Geneva agreement, of advancing the plan of
 invasion of the South, and at the same time
 765-428-96923
 permitting the Front for Liberation of the
 South to recruit new adherents, and to gain
 the sympathy of nonalined  countries in
 southeast Asia.
 "The People's Revolutionary Party has only
 the appearance of an independent existence;
 actually, our party is nothing but the Lao
 Dong Party of Vietnam (Vietminh Commu-
 nist Party), unified from North to South,
 under the direction of the central executive
 committee of the party, the chief of which
 is President Ho. * *
 "During these explanations, take care to
 keep this strictly secret, especially in South
 Vietnam, so that the enemy does not perceive
 our purpose. * * *
 "Do not put these explanations in party
 bulletins."
 Another party circular of the same date
 said:
 "The reasons for the change in the party's
 name must be kept stricly secret.  Accord-
 ing to instructions of the Central Commit-
 tee, one must not tell the people or party
 sympathizers that the People's Revolutionary
 Party and the Lao Dong Party of Vietnam
 are one.  One must not say that it is only a
 tactic, because it would not be good for the
 enemy to know."
 A third party circular, dated December 8,
 1961, said:
 "Study the instructions so that you will
 be able to execute them.  In passing them to
 D2V, D2, and K, be very careful that the
 documents do not fall into enemy hands.
 After D2N/C has passed to the sections, de-
 stroy the written documents immediately."
 The originals and translations of the above
 documents were submitted to the Interna-
 tional Control Commission by the Govern-
 ment of Vietnam on May 30, 19621
 In 1964 new rules and regulations were
 promulgated for the People's Revolutionary
 Party.  A copy of the new rules was captured
 from the Vietcong in Chuong Thien Province
 in November  1964.  A photograph of the
 captured document appears on the next page.
 Key portions of the instructions said that
 new rules and regulations had been ap-
 proved for the PRP, "but the real nature of
 those rules and regulations is that they still
 are the rules and regulations of the Vietnam
 Lao Dong Party (in North Vietnam)."
 The instructions added: "* * * we should
 realize that our country is one country, that
 the Vietnamese People's Revolutionary Party
 and the Vietnam Lao Dong Party are one
 party. * * * There is nothing different be-
 tween the two parties."

 text, see the white paper "Communist Viet-
 minh Aggressive Policy," published by the
 Government of the Republic of Vietnam,
 Saigon, July 1962.

 Some of the consequences of Vietcong ter-
 rorism are shown in the accompanying pho-
 tographs (not printed in the RECORD).
 LETTER TO  THE  PRESIDENT  OF THE  U.N.
 SECURITY COUNCIL
 (Signed by A. Stevenson)
 (Circular No. 1589, dated February 27.)
 For the information of members of the
 Security Council, I am transmitting a spe-
 cial report entitled "Aggression from the
 North, the Record of North Vietnam's Cam-
 paign To Conquer South Vietnam," which
 my Government is making public today.  It
 presents evidence from which the following
 conclusions are inescapable:
 First, the subjugation by forces of the
 Republic of Vietnam by the regime in north-
 ern Vietnam is the formal, official policy of
 that regime; this has been stated and con-
 firmed publicly over the past 5 years.
 Second, the war in Vietnam is directed
 by the Central Committee of the Lao Dong
 Party (Communist) which controls the gov-
 ernment in northern Vietnam.
 765-428-96923
 Third, the so-called Peoples Revolutionary
 Party in the Republic of Vietnam is an inte-
 gral part- of the Lao Dong Party in North
 Vietnam.           -      -
 Fourth, the so-called Liberation Front for
 South -Vietnam is a subordinate unit of the
 Central Office for South Vietnam, an integral
 part of  the  governmental  machinery  in
 Hanoi.
 Fifth, the key leadership of the Vietcong-
 officers, specialists, technicians, intelligence
 agents, political organizers and propagan-
 dists-has been trained, equipped and sup-
 plied in the north and sent into the Republic
 of Vietnam under Hanoi's military orders.
 Sixth, most of the weapons, including new
 types recently introduced, and most of the
 ammunition and other supplies used by the
 Vietcong, have been sent from North to
 South Vietnam.
 Seventh, the scale of infiltration of men
 and arms, including regular units of the
 Armed Forces of North Vietnam, has in-
 creased appreciably in recent months.
 Approved For Release 2003/12/02 : CIA-RDP75-00149R000200310041-4
 Approved For Release 2003/12/02 : CIA-RDP75-00149R000200310041-4
 Eighth, this entire pattern of activity by
 the regime in Hanoi is in violation of gen-
 eral principles of international law and the
 Charter of the United Nations, and is in di-
 rect violation of the Geneva accord of 1954.
 Such a pattern of violation of the treaty ob-
 ligations undertaken at Geneva was con-
 firmed by a special report of the Interna-
 tional Control Commission in 1962 and it
 has been greatly intensified since then.
 These facts about the situation in Viet-
 nam make it unmistakably clear that the
 character of that conflict is an aggressive war
 of conquest waged against a neighbor-and
 makes nonsense of the cynical allegation
 that this Is simply an indigenous insurrec-
 tion.
 I request that you circulate copies of the
 report, together with copies of this letter,
 765-428-96923
 to the delegations of all member states as a
 Security Council document.
 In making this information available to
 the Security Council, my Government wishes
 to say once more that peace can be restored
 quickly to Vietnam by a prompt and assured
 cessation of aggression by Hanoi against the
 Republic of Vietnam.  In that event, my
 Government-as it has said many times be-
 fore, would be happy to withdraw its mili-
 tary forces from the Republic of Vietnam
 and turn promptly to an International effort
 to assist the economic and social develop-
 ment of southeast Asia.
 In the meantime, my Government awaits
 the first indication of any intent by the
 Government in Hanoi to return to the ways
 of peace and peaceful resolution of this In-
 ternational conflict.
