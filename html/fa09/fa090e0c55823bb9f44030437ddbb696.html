 ~ reports an a g d Soviet  i an to attack How   e  a e y
 after the he signing of the Japanese peace treaty, possibly 18 September.
 Far East Command comments that the actual plan of attack is within
 Soviet capabilities, although 1?t is not considered to be the most exped-
 itious or efficient.  However, in one section of the plan a total at-
 tacking force of five divisions is envisaged, while in other sections
 it is indicated that 33 divisions will be used.  Because of these con-
 tradictory figures and other questionable aspects, Far East Command
 considered that further investigation must precede a satisfactory
 evaluations  SC&P9 however, concludes that the report contains enough
 factual informatjo   particularly regarding order of battle, to warrant
 careful considsmUon,  (TS Army to SD 07/14425, 7 Sep 51)
 Comment:  There have been reports that the Japanese Communist Party
 has for iome months 'been using the threat of a Soviet attack on Hokkaido.
 as part of its campaign against the peace treaty.  This report's al-
 leged origin ?- from a member of the Soviet security police    renders,
 it suspect as a plant. or a fabricated report,
 2     Kirk sees Vishinaky on US citizens detained in Communist China.
 Ambassador Kirk talked with Soviet Foreign Min iit4r Vishinsky on 6
 September about a Department of State message urging the governments of
 the USSR and ten other nations to intercede with Communist China on be-
 half of US citizens imprisoned or forcibly detained in China,
 Vishinsky remarked that the message had not been sent to the most
 important addressee, Communist Chinaq stating that it was not necessary
 to have diplomatic relations in order to exchange direct messages,  He
 believed that the US.oitizens in question were being given justice and
 said that inasmuch as this was a matter of Chinese internal affairs the
 Soviet Government "of course, could not intervene"  However, the
 message would be considered.
 Vishinslqr complained about the US failure to recognize the "lawful"
 government of China and boasted that, without the presence of the
 American Seventh Fleet, the Chiang Kai-shek regime'-would-be disposed of
 within an hour.  (C SD Outgoing 220, 4 Sep; C Moscow 397, 6 Sep 51)

 that the' Government has no intention of finishing construction while
 t ie A1:uA6 ,ens remain in Austria,' E (S Vienna 914, 6 Sep 51)
 Comments  The station and power site is included in an 'ambitious
 laiwerhydroeleotrio project contemplated by the Austrians for
 some time*    Figlgs private assurances that construction will not be re-
 sumed is in contrast with published reports that the five-year develop-
 ment will go

 industry has been largely concentrated in the Western zones of occupa-

 draw Hungarian business from Trieste and as a possible attempt to charge
 Allied Military Government officials' with a violation of the peace
 treatyt s4free port provisions. Unger stated that Hungarian traffic

 4.    MALAYA.  nit  Onn outlines aimat of new nartvs  Details of the aims and or-
 ganization of the proposed "Independence of Malaya Party" (IMP) were re-
 leased in Kuala Lumpur on 6 September by Dato Onn, the party?s founder.  The
 IMP will be formally inaugurated on 16 September with a program of self-
 determination and union of all Malayans irrespective of race, creed or class.
 (R FBID Malayan Home Service,, 6 Sep 51)
 Comments  The formation of a party with political (as distinct from
 narrowly communal) aims is a revolutionary step in Malaya.  Dato Onn, this
 policy's author, is generally considered the most energetic and enlightened
 of Malayan politicians.
 5,    THAI    .          1Aw? ifteds  The Thai Government on 6 September announced
 that martial law, which had been imposed on 30 June during the navy coup
 effort, was terminated.  (Press ticker, Bangkok, 6 Sep 51)
 omment-  With the lifting of martial law, the and of press censorship
 may be anticipitated.  This may also be followed by a flood of pro-Communist,
 anti-government propaganda.  Charges that US equipment was used in suppressing
 the coup and that the US, through ECA and MAAG, is attempting to control Thai
 political, economic and military activities might be expected.
 6.     INDOCHINA.    US-Vie n EGA Ugreem&nt si?Q    Representatives of the Vietnam
 Government and of the ECA mission in Indochina today signed an agreement
 covering economic aid, the first deliveries of which were made a year ago.
 Similar agreements will shortly be signed between Laos and Cambodia and the
 US.  (R Press Ticker, 7 Sep 51)
 &n As,  The French authorities have been reluctant to see the con
 22mT
 elusion of a purely bilateral pact between the US and Vietnam.  On 28 June
 the French Government unexpectedly prohibited the signature of the agreed
 text on the ground that French Union protocol had not been complied with.
 Negotiation since that time has dealt with these objections and with textual
 changes subsequently proposed by the French.

 or   o  A -
 is allegedly the subsource of the following      summary  o
 Peip ng s v ews on various possible military operations.           Peiping proposes
 to emphasize "southward aggression,," leaving northeastern Asian questions
 "largely" to the Soviets.  Peiping regards the Korean conflict as a "side-
 show," sincerely desires a cease-fire,, and has been "warned" that Soviet
 air and naval aid will be provided only after a Korean settlement.  Peiping
 "would prefer" to take action to gain access to valuable bases and resources
 theast Asia  and is "especially fearful" of US aid to Thailand.  (S
 Comments  Much of the above,, which appears to be based upon speculation
 rather than upon access to Peiping's planning,, may derive from the pro-
 nouncements of the 1FTU conference at Peiping in late 1949.  The strategy
 outlined by the conference provided for extensive Chinese aid to the "liber-
 ation" movements of East Asia, most of which lie south of China.  However.,
 the thesis that Peiping views Korea as a "sideshow" appears emphatically
 disproved by events; Peiping's desire for.a cease-fire is conjectural; and
 Soviet air and naval aid has been provided on a continuing basis.  Eventual
 Chinese Communist military action against Southeast Asian nations has long
 been regarded as a probability- the source0s extravagant statement regarding
 Thailand may derive from Peiping's continual denunciation of Thailand's con-
 spicuous cooperation with the US.

 An                                from Changsha reports that Mao Tse-tung's
 theoretical works have "almost    sappeared" from indoctrination courses and    -
 have been replaced by translation f the writings of Marx       Lenin and Stalin.
 25X1A
 C-    >t4  This report is contrary to information from all other sources
 and is regarded as'very doubtful.  The later theoretical works of Mao Tse-
 tung                        which are Stalinist in orientation '- have been given enormous cir-
 culation inside and outside Communist China,, and are at the top of Peiping's
 list of required reading.  It is also true, however,, that translations of
 the Communist fathers have also been widely disseminated in China., and the
 source may have been led by the appearance of such works in large numbers
 to overestimate their comparative status.

 Hanoi 1359 6 Sep 51)
 n n s  These reports mm or rumors mo are believed false.  Chu Chia-
 pi, who defected from the Nationalists after World War II, became well-known
 as a guerrilla leader in Yunnan and has frequently been reported as playing
 a major role in Peipingas plans for assistance to Burmese Communist forces.
 Chu's defection at the time stated o? presumably to Li Mils Nationalist

 The major oil companies at Hong Kong have indicated that they will not

 mm   s         A remarkably similar Chinese Nationalist report of late August
 alleged the transfer of a "Third Air Division" from Sakhalin to Mukden and
 Dairen to enter the Korean War as volunteers, "when the cease fire negoti-
 ations break down."  No Soviet unit of this designation has been identified
 on Sakhalin, but movements of air units in this area could occur without
 detection,
 13.    KOREA.  Additional irications  e n of Go   ni offensive in en i  ss  The
 US Far East Command on 7 September observes that "'several attacks one
 of regimental size supported by tanks) launched 6 September against
 friendly patrol bases along the west central front indicate increased
 sensitivity to UN : patrol. action and that the enemy is noving his counter-
 reconnaissance screen forward in this area." (S CINCFE.Telecon 5130,

 e  a The adoption of strong counter-reconnaissance measures
 prior to an offensive is standard tactical doctrine in all armies.  An
 additional factor is seen in the presence of armor so far forward.  The
 enemy has committed his armor only once before in his previous 1951
 offensives (five tanks in an abortive attempt on 1 May) .
 14,          Communists react to UN?s char-ae of R9Caucasian troobs in Korey"t
 A 6 September broadcast from Peiping labels the UN?s statement that
 Caucasian volunteers"' are in Korea as a "nightmare creation of Van
 Fleet?s fears."'  The broadcast concludes with the statement that: the
 two Communist correspondents in Kaesong    Winnington and Burchett --
 are the only Caucasians in North Korea other than embassy personnel in
 Pyongyang.  (U FBID, NCNA Peiping., 6 Sep 51)
 a: The Communistel immediate reaction to this claim is inter-
 esting although no deduction can be made as to Communist motives,  It is:
 generally accepted that Soviet personnel are present in North. Korean
 rear areas serving as advisers., technicians., and as anti-aircraft gunners,

 2s  While there is no confirmative evidence concerning
 these visits., it is highly probable that the 'Communist command will establish
 forward command posts prior to the next offensive.  The town of Icho6n
 is well located for such a post.  There are a number of indications that
 infantry and armored strength is being concentrated in the western
 sector in preparation for an attack along the approaches to Seoul.
 Nn information is available concerning Chinese Communist air act iv-
 _ities   in Pyongyang.  It is considered doubtful that the Communists
 could. have. all airfields in North Korea operational by the end of

 and that the ROK loaned over 36 billion won to the UN forces for military
 use during the month of August.  This currency increase raised the com-
 modity price index during the month from 2,682 to 3,067.  The letter con-
 tinues that if the "settlement for the loan be delayed, the current in-
 flation'might get out of the government?s control."
 Ambassador Muccio comments that the anticipated, seasonal currency
 circulation rise during the harvest season, coupled with the already 'ab-
 normal monthly increases, "may bring hyper inflation unless every possible
 anti-inflationary factor is exploited to the fullest extent."
 Another manifestation of acute ROK concern with the inflation crisis
 was the overwhelming_National Assembly vote on 6 September to send a special
 economic mission to the US to obtain settlement of the outstanding loan to
 the UN military command.  (S Pusan 235, 7 Sep 519 S Pusan 238, 8 Sep 51)
 R   The burden of financing UN military purchases of native
 materials and labor during the Korean war has fallen heavily on the already
 weak ROK financial structure.  UN aid goods are not yet arriving in sufficient
 quantities to absorb any material amount of the inflated ROK currency.
 17.    JAPAN.  A=1-Communist bill rex~ortedly ender nrex~a~?~+ions  The Japanese press
 reports that a bill which will virtually outlaw the Japanese_Communist Party
 is being prepared secretly in the Attorney General?s office.  (R FBIU9 6 Sep 51)
 C-   n s  Sentiment on outlawing the party appears to be divided within
 the government, opponents pointing out that failure of the police to apprehend
 the missing Communist leaders indicates that the police are unable to cope
 with an underground Communist movement.  The government, however.. is expected
 to prepare permanent legislation to replace occupation directed ordinances
 upon which the government is currently basing its anti-Communist activities.
 18.          Go_yernmen  denur eg=s ~0 6~9~ro ?sei~gal servicemens   The
 Japanese Government on 7 September announced the depurge of 10,61,9 more pro-
 fessional military of ranks up to army colonel and navy captain.  The list
 includes 865 colonels.  This is the fifth list of former servicemen to be
 depurged.  Still remaining on the list are 40,000 gendarmes and some 10,000
 former servicemen, including generals and admirals.  Whether.these purgees
 will be cleared will be decided late next week.  (R FBID Ticker Kyodo, 7 Sep 51)
 Gqmmaa s  The depurges of former officers may be contributing to the
 increasing discussion of rearmament as recently noted in Japan by CINCFE.

 SECTION'3  (WESTERN)
 1.   GERMANY.  Allies map countermeasures in Berlin:  Meeting in Berlin on
 6 S eptember, the  llie. Deputy High Commissioners and Berlin Commandants
 discussed means of combatting the latest Soviet squeeze on West Berlin.
 They decided to dispatph a letter to Soviet authorities protesting inter-
 ference with free Allied access to Berlin, and to instruct German officials
 to submit proposals on the imposition of a tax both on East German barges
 travelling in West Berlin canals and on East German vehicles travelling in
 Western Germany.  The above countermeasures were to be implemented by
 17 September at the latest if the USSR failed to remove its restrictions
 as requested.
 They further decided the West should provide all possible assistance
 to alleviate Berlin transport difficulties, particularly with respect to
 perishable shipments such as milk..
 The meeting was marked by French reluctance to adopt firm retaliatory
 measures.  The French even suggested that the Allies permit the signing of
 an interzonal trade agreement between East and West Germany, but the. US and
 UK representatives, in rejecting this suggestion, emphasized that such action
 would represent "a horrible loss of face for the West.n
 German officials from the Federal Republic and West Berlin who were
 called in to discuss the situation with the Allies showed little enthusiasm
 for firm countermeasures.  (S Berlin 364, 7 Sep 51)
 Comment:  In applying its recent series of harassing measures in Berlin,
 the USSR has succeeded in creating a situation where discussion of counter-
 measures in each case inevitably produces division and haggling among Allied
 and German officials, therefore reducing the chances for effective retali-
 ation.
 2.         New constitutional court finally to be established:  West Germany's
 new Federal Constitutional Court wri l.probably be organized in time to com-.
 mence sessions sometime next week.  Establishment of the court has been
 delayed for several. months, largely because of the failure of the major
 political parties to agree on the 21 justices and, more recently, on the
 president of the court.  They finally agreed on 4 September to name
 Dr. Hermann Hoepker Aschoff as president.  The new president, respected in
 Bonn and regarded by local US officials as a fortunate choice, is a member
 of the Free Democrats, and is expected to be a strong president.
 The first case before the court will probably be a complaint that the
 plebiscite scheduled for 16 September to determine whether a Southwest State
 should be formed within West Germany is illegal.  (R Bonn 151, 5 Sep 51)

 Comment:  The prolonged controversy over choosing the court's members
 has delaconsideration of such important issues as the outlawing of
 certain extremist parties, including the Socialist Reich Party.  The new
 president was originally opposed by "states' rights" interests on the
 grounds that he was known to be a centralist.
 3.  AUSTRIA.  Federal Chancellor reportedly threatened by party revolt: Socialist
 Vice-  ancel or Schaerf has informed Commissioner Donnelly that rightist
 elements of the conservative People's Party, led by governors of the Western
 provinces and by several Cabinet ministers including Foreign Minister Gruber,
 are seeking to replace Chancellor Figl with someone more sympathetic to their
 views. Characterizing the maneuvering as the beginning of a "Fascist" movement,
 Schaerf asserts that Figl may survive until the next general election in 1953,
 but adds that the opposition is strong.  The Socialists, Schaerf contends,
 are apprehensive that the coalition may break down; he asserts that the
 Socialists will never participate in a government that includes both the
 People's Party and the near-reactionary Union of Independents.
 In a subsequent conversation with Donnelly, Figl said that neither the
 coalition nor his position was in danger,  He described the opposition leaders
 within his party as "provincial almighties" who criticize but are unwilling
 to accept responsibilities outside their own provinces,  (C Vienna 900,
 6 Sep 51)
 Comment:  The Chancellor's dismissal of opposition to his party leader-
 ship as "provincial" is scarcely supported by the facts,  Defeated presidential
 candidate Heinrich Gleissner, governor of Upper Austria, has openly flouted
 government policies in-the meat crisis.  'hile supporting the Chancellor,
 the Socialists themselves have not been averse to encouraging defection of
 People's Party members to splinter groups on the extreme right..
 Rightists move to form new political party: Negotiations are
 proceeding among former members of the People's Party-and a Salzburg group
 connected with the Union of Independents for the organization of a new
 political party, possibly to be called the "Freedom Party."  Participating
 in the current negotiations, in addition to the Union of Independents group,
 are members of the Junge Front -- a "reformist" clique recently expelled
 from the People's Party -- and followers of Karl Aichorn, parliamentary
 deputy who defected from the People's Party..  Component groupb of the new
 party are comparatively insignificant in number.  They believe, however,
 that by cooperating with the Union of Independents they can form a rightist
 bloc of sufficient strength to obtain People's Party cooperation and possibly
 the opportunity to participate in the government.  Present plans allegedly
 call for a constituent convention in Vienna in September, joint participation
 in future elections, and a sharing of any electoral victories on an equal
 basis.  (S Joint Weeka 35, USFA, 1 Sep 51)

 Comment:  The relatively' negligible Junge Front, long critical of co-
 opera io~'on                       th the Socialists, was ousted from the People's Party in July
 after attributing the party's defeat in the Presidential election to weak-
 kneed acquiescence to the Socialists' demands,  Since both Junge Front and
 Union of Independents leaders strongly espouse an anti Marxist cause, it
 was virtually inevitable that the former should gravitate toward the latter,,
 which demonstrated considerable strength in the presidential elections.
 If the Union of Independents should succeed in corralling the factious
 elements of-the extreme right, it will become a potent movement which can
 capitalize upon increasing dissension within the otherwise loyal membership
 of the People's Party,
 5 a
 Soviet official a  resses o timism on treaty pros ects:  According
 to Chancellor Fig , an unidentified  ovie  official in Vienna  as recently
 told him that the state treaty problem is being studied and that chances for
 agreement may be better after the San Francisco conference,  The Soviet of-
 ficial refused, however, to elaborate further-on the subject, remarking
 only that the Western powers and not the USSR have heretofore prevented agree-
 ment,  Chancellor Figl continues to urge the necessity for a meeting`of the
 four treaty deputies in the near future, pointing out that the conclusion of
 a treaty with Japan and a contractual agreement with Western Germany will
 make the resumption of treaty negotiations a psychological necessity for
 the Austrians, (S Vienna 912, 6 Sep 51)
 Comment: The optimistic observation of the Soviet official, probably
 Deputy  ossioner Tsinev, has the appearances of conversational for-
 bearance rather than. of firm policy commitment.  It should be noted, however,
 that Soviet authorities have recently demonstrated an increased sensitivity
 to Austrian popular opinion.  After years of representations by the Austrian
 Government, the Soviet headquarters has within the last week released
 information concerning the fate of a number of Austrians deported to the
 Soviet Union and has promised that all such persons will now be permitted
 to communicate with their families in Austria,
 6e     FRANCE.  Premises of another Communist   enc  damned:  For the third time
 1        , the premises o  a Communist agency in France have suffered
 since    Aug
 bomb damage,. Early in the morning of 6 September, a plastic charge was
 exploded at the entrance of the Banque Commerciale Pour l'Europe du Nord,
 which handles French Communist Party funds and has close connections with
 the Soviet Embassy.  The. interior of the bank was damaged extensively, and
 all windows within 150 yards were shattered.
 This incident may be the work of irresponsible rightist elements,
 although it is not improbable that the Communists may be attempting to
 create false charges of "Fascist provocation," (R Paris 181, 6 Sep 51)

 Comment:  A similar attack on CGT headquarters on 6 June was labelled
 by thee Communists.as "Gaullist provocation."  Only secondary Communist
 installations -- libraries, reading rooms, and the bank - have been
 involved so far.  No such attacks are likely upon the Communist headquarters
 at 44 rue le Peletier, Paris, because it is always under heavy party guard.
 7.     UNITED KINGDOM.   Government welfare policy narrowly avoids defeat at
 cri   a  tra e union con erence:  After scoring reatively easy victories
 over le ?t-wing critics of he governmentws foreign policy and rearmament
 program, the Trades Union Congress leadership ran into difficulties at the
 6 September meeting of the annual conference on a resolution attacking the
 health service charges    the issue over which Aneurin Bevan resigned from
 the cabinet last spring.  The resolution was defeated, but only by a compara-
 tively small margin under rules compelling delegations to cast their votes
 in a block; press reports maintain that the majority of the delegates in
 the hall favored the resolution.
 Earlier, the US Embassy reported that Communist attempts to criticize
 government policies were less spirited than at last year's conference and
 that the usual Communist claque in the gallery'wae missing.  (R London 1217,
 6 Sep 51; U NY Times, 7 Sep 51)
 Comment:  The close vote on the issue of welfare legislation indicates
 that  a or Government supporters are still directing formidable pressure
 against the government's policy of cutting civilian living standards to pay
 for accelerated rearmament.  The diminution of Communist attacks on govern-
 ment policy is probably attributable to a deliberate Communist tactic of
 not embarrassing the anti-Communist critics of these same policies,

 to approve the US.proposal to terminate US-obligations to Czechoslovakia
 under the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs.  If necessary, however,
 it will probably vote with the US.  Foreign Office officials fear that by
 emphasizing political rather than economic grounds for obtaining inter
 national approval to terminate American tariff commitments to the Czechs,
 the US is setting a dangerous precedent that may be explo,.ted by countries
 like Egypt or India.  The Danes also indicated their displeasure with the
 US Congress' practice of overriding by fiat international commitments, and
 cited the recent limitation on Danish cheese exports to the US.  (C
 Copenhagen 201, 5 Sep 51).
 Comment:  The British Government, though promising to support the
 US position on Czechoslovakia, also has misgivings about making the case
 on, specifically political grounds.  The French refuse to support the U5

 for juridical reasons.  The Danes' annoyance over Congressional restrictions
 on the importation of Danish cheese into the US is heightened by the fact
 that ECA has sought to stimulate such dollar-earning exports from Denmark.
 GUATEMALA.  Another strike of government employees provisionally settled:
 Congressional and labor leader-shave settled the one-day strike of some
 5,000 government customs house workers. Prior to the strike, President
 Arbenz reportedly told the workers that such a strike would constitute a
 "catastrophic blow to the country."  When the strike was announced, Minister
 of Labor Charnaud MacDonald promptly declared it illegal and warned that
 "the instigators of illegal strikes remain subject to legal responsibilities."
 Ridiculing this statement, the strikers indicated that they would remain out
 until Congress acceded to their demands.  They subsequently returned to work
 after congressional leaders agreed to consider their petition demanding 20 to
 75 percent wage increases.  (U NY Times, 7 Sep 513 La Prensa (NY), 7 Sep 51)
 Comment:   The strike, the fifth by government employees since the
 inaugura  on of President Arbenz in March, reveals the relative weakness
 of the executive department and the relative strength of Congress, which
 is dominated by leftist, pro-labor parties.  Although the government may
 have to resort to financial juggling, it will probably grant wage increases
 despite the "illegal" nature of the strike.
 10.   VENEZUELA.  Non-commissioned officers arrested in plot against superiors:
 efih  US Embassy in Caracas reports that enlisted men and possibly non-
 commissioned officers at four widely separated army garrisons were involved
 in a plot "against officers," and that 20 sergeants were arrested in the
 Maracaibo area in a general round-up of opposition leaders.                      25X1C
 indicates that the non-commissioned officers were the primary plo  ers an
 that the sergeants were arrested for "turning enlisted men away from the
 officers."  The plot was supposedly sponsored by the outlawed Accion
 Democratica party with the aid of some of this year's army recruits..
 The government believes that the situation is under control,, but is
 on the alert for possible AD or Communist attempts to embarrass it during
 .the petroleum convention now in progress with officials of various foreign
 governments in attendance.  The embassy comments that the armed forces
 continue to appear united, but that "sporadic outbursts are always possible.'
 (C Caracas 123, 7 Sep 513                                                     25X1A
 Comment-.  This is the first report of organized discontent in the
 lower echelons of the army. Since the alleged plot got no further than
 attempts to "turn the men against the officers," and since apparently no
 officers were involved, there is no reason to believe that the government
 will not continue to keep the situation in hand even though fux'ther
 "sporadic outbursts" might occur.

 SECTION 2 (EASTERN)
 1.    IRAN.  Opposition to Iran's prime minister gathers strength:  The tE Ambassa-
 dor in Tehran states that an organized plan to force the resignation of Prime
 Minister Mossadeq is under way in Parliament's lower house.  The ambassador
 adds that British-supported Seyyid Zia currently is favored as Mossadeq's
 successor, although Qavam is also being seriously considered.  (TS, S/S.Tehran
 932, 7 Sep 51).
 Comment:  Anti-Mossadeq forces have increased their activity with the
 approach of the pre-election adjournment of parliament.  Believing that
 settlement of the oil problem is impossible while Mossadeq remains prime
 minister, and aware that the government has been strengthening its electoral
 position by placing its sympathizers in strategic positions in the provincial
 governments, members of the opposition are making an increased effort to re-
 place Mossadeq before parliament adjourns.
 2.    BURMA.  US asks Chinese Nationalists to withdraw their troops from Burma: The
 US Department of State has instructed its ambassador in Taipei to stress the
 serious concern of the US over the continued presence of Nationalist troops
 in Burma.  The ambassador is requested to point out that the situation could
 develop most unfavorably from the international viewpoint and to express the
 hope that the Taipei government will make every effort to withdraw their
 troops from Burma as quickly as possible.  (S, S/S to Taipei 209, 5 Sep 51).
 Comment:  Nationalist forces in Burma constitute a continuing pretext
 for an invasion of Burma by the Chinese Nationalists..
 3,             Burmese views regarding Japan:  A high official of the Burmese
 Foreign Office informed a US Embassy officer in Rangoon that his government
 expects to take up again the matter of a Japanese peace treaty with India and
 Indonesia after the San Francisco conference.  He indicated that Burma favor-
 ed a simple treaty which avoided all controversial issues, called for the
 termination of war,      recognized Japanese sovereignty, and provided for
 trade.  The official pointedly played down the idea of an Asian peace confer-
 ence?                  (C, S/S Rangoon 257, 6 Sep 51).
 Comment:  Burma's position as revealed in this report reflects strong
 Indian influence and confirms the belief that the reparations issue was ex-
 ploited as a convenient means to avoid antagonizing the Soviet bloc through
 attendance at the San Francisco conference.
