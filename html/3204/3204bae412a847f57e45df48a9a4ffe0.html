 ITALY: FANFANI UNDER FIRE
 Italy's Christian Democratic Party is about
 to begin an internal debate that could determine
 whether the party can maintain its position as
 Italy's dominant political force.
 The Christian Democratic national council
 meeting tomorrow will discuss how to halt the
 erosion of the party's strength that was revealed
 by the outcome of the regional, provincial, and
 municipal  elections  last  month.  The Com-
 munists came close to outpolling the Christian
 Democrats for the first time. Sentiment in the
 120-member council has been building against
 party leader Fanfani, and a move to revise his
 conservative political line is likely. Fanfani says
 he will not give up his job unless he is voted out
 by the council. There are signs that more than a
 majority of the council members are inclined to
 do just that.
 Prime Minister Moro is one key Christian
 Democrat who has yet to bic,'c publicly with
 Fanfani. Moro is still the party's most pres-
 tigious left-of-center leader, and his alliance with
 Fanfani helped protect the latter from the
 attacks of the left wing as the Christian Demo-
 crats suffered successive defeats during the last
 two years. Moro will probably soon withdraw
 his support and that would ensure Fanfani's
 departure.
 The Socialist Party, meanwhile, is follow-
 ing a line at the regional and local levels that
 differs only in phrasing from Communist chief
 Berlinguer's  "historic compromise" concept.
 Berlinguer has argued since la'-,e 1973 that the
 solution  to  the country's problems  lies in
 cooperation among the "popular and demo-
 cratic" forces, mainly Communists, Socialists,
 and Christian Democrats. The Socialists are now
 calling for "open governments" at the regional
 and local levels, in which all parties except the
 neo-fascists are invited to participate.
 The invitation, however, seems mainly to
 be a way of justifying the Socialists' apparent
 preference for alliances with the Communists at
 the local level. The moderate gains made by the
 Socialists in the elections gave them the option
 of linking up with the Communists or the
 Christian Democrats in many areas. In one such
 area, the northeastern region of Liguria, the
 Socialists chose last week to join a Communist-
 led government r-ther than a center-left coali-
 tion with the Christian Democrats.
 The Socialists' preference for a government
 with the Communists in the larger and more
 industrialized region of Piedmont, however, is
 more  likely  to  provoke trouble  than  the

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/02/23: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000080033-3
 Ligurian arrangement. Unlike Liguria, the two
 parties do not quite have a  majority  in
 Piedmont. The Socialists are inclined to set up a
 minority government with the Communists in
 Piedmont, despite the fact that a center-left
 coalition with the Christian Democrats would
 have a comfortable majority. Two members of
 the  Moro  cabinet, whose home base  is
 Piedmont, are threatening to bring down the
 government by  resigning  if the Socialists
 abandon the center-left formula in that region.
 In their post-election policies, the Com-
 munists are sticking to the moderate line they
 emphasized in the campaign. Communist labor
 leaders, for example, were mainly responsible
 for the decision last week by Italy's top labor
 federation to seek maximum employment rather
 than excessive wage demands in major contract
 negotiations this fall. The federation's strategy
 should encourage calmer and less prctracted
 bargaining in  the fall, unless some of the
 militant constituent unions refuse to go along.
 Deputy Prime Minister La Malfa, a frequent
 critic of labor's policies, praised the Communist-
 sponsored  proposals as eminently sensible.
 Participants at the European security con-
 ference agreed on Monday to accept July 30 as
 the opening date for a three-day summit in
 Helsinki, provided that differences on all out-
 standing issues are resolved by July 18. Nego-
 tiators have been working furiously in Geneva
 throughout the week to reach agreement on
 more than a dozen issues, including military-
 related  confidence-building  measures.  Final
 acceptance of the July 30 date is expected this
 weekend.
 On July  14, NATO members and the
 Warsaw Pact states bowed to Malta's demand
 that the final conference document include a
 call for the eventual reduction of armed forces
 in the Mediterranean region. Prime Minister
 Mintoff of Malta, after dropping an earlier
 demand for a phased withdrawal of the US and
 Soviet fleets from the Mediterranean, forced
 acceptance of a Mediterranean declaration by
 refusing-for four days-to agree on a summit
 date.
 Agreement was also reached during the
 week on several major issues, including follow-
 on procedures for the conference, principles
 governing relations among states, and a clause
 protecting Allied rights in Germany and Berlin.
 Little progress was made, however, in meeting
 Turkey's demands for a clause exempting it
 from certain aspects of military-related con-
 fidence-building measures.
 Agreement had not been reached by mid-
 week on more than a dozen other less weighty
 issues,  including  the order of  speakers at
 Helsinki, trade reciprocity, and a clause extend-
 ing the benefits of CSCE throughout Europe-
 especially to Berlin. The EC is also insisting that
 Italian Premier Moro be allowed to sign the final
 act twice-acting on behalf of the EC as well as
 IDaly.
 The Turkish demands are the only major
 stumbling block to a final agreement. Influenced
 by strong demarches from several NATO states,
 Ankara is now showing more flexibility and has
 muted its call for Turkish Cypriot representa-
 tion at Helsinki. On confidence-building meas-
 ures, Ankara appears willing to give advance
 notification of manuevers within a 250-kilo-
 meter zone along its borders if the conferees will
 make concessions on separate notification if
 amphibious and airborne troop movements. This
 compromise would include language stating that
 notification need not be given in areas adjacent
 to borders with nor,-participating states-thus
 exempting manuevers in eastern and southern
 Turkey.
 In Helsinki, meanwhile, preparations for
 the summit are proceeding at a hectic pace. The
 Finns are expecting 900 dcIegates, accompanied
 by thousands of support personnel, to attend
 the 35-nation summit and have beaun elaborate
 security   re arations

 PORTUGAL: POLITICAL CRISIS MOUNTS
 A crisis atmosphere continued in Lisbon
 this week as the Revolutionary Council was con-
 fronted with the need to form a new cabinet
 and with a rising storm of protest over its efforts
 to bypass the political parties. The resolution of
 these questions may be largely determined by
 the outccme of a power struggle now reportedly
 taking place among its leading members.
 The cabinet crisis was precipitated when
 the Socialist Party pulled out of the coalition
 government last week because of the seizure of
 the newspaper Republica. The Socialists were
 followed by the center-left Popular Democratic
 Party on July 16 when the Armed Forces Move-
 ment failed to meet the party's demands for a
 free press, a pledge not to dissolve the popularly
 elected constituent assembly, and a promise of
 prompt municipal and trade union elections.
 The Popular Democrats also demanded an end
 to the present divisions within the Movement
 leadership and the urgent adoption of measures
 to deal with the rapidly deteriorating economic
 situation.
 The withdrawal of the Popular Democrats
 has effectively dissolved the coalition and paves
 th::. way for the formation of a new government.
 Prime Minister Goncalves has been charged with
 naming a new cabinet, and a Movement spokes-
 man has said it will not be composed exclusively
 of military officers. There is speculation that
 non-party civilian technical experts will join the
 military in the new body.
 Mean,rjhile, the Revolutionary Council is
 being subjected to increasing pressure from all
 sides. At a large demonstration in Aviero last
 weekend, Catholics demander' the return of the
 church radio, which is occupied by pro-com-
 munist workers. In Rio Maior, just north of
 Lisbon, local offices of the Communist, and a
 fellow-traveling party, were sacked and burned
 by local farmers. On July 16, a pro-communist
 demonstration--o-+e of several held this week-
 was joined by soldiers from a leftist military
 unit.
 The firm stand taken by the non-com-
 munist parties against the proposed formation
 of popular councils has been reinforced by
 sizable demonstrations by the Socialist Party,
 which is openly moving toward direct opposi-
 tion                                                                  to  the Armed  Forces Movement. The
 Socialists have  publicly denounced  security
 chief Otelo de Carvalhu over his role in. the
 Republica affair and are demanding Goncalves'
 resignation. Party leader Mario Snares has also
 denouric,ad the popular councils concept as a
 tactic by the military to establish a communist
 dictatorship and has threatened    "symbolic
 paralysis" of the country if the voice of the
 parties is not heeded.
 25X1    25X1
 There are increasing signs that these and
 other vital  issues-notably the threatening
 economic collapse, the resumption of fighting in
 Angola, and the growing impatience of the
 Portuguese people and even members of the
 Movement itself-may at last bring to a head the
 disagreements  and divisions among principal
 members of the Revolutionary CounciI_F
 In its public statements the Movement has
 already begun to temporize on its plans to
 bypass the parties. It has suggested that the
 proposals on the popular councils do not con-
 stitute an immutable law and, in any case, are to
 be established  over a  long  period.  If the
 moderates' move to oust Goncalves should fail,
 however, another lurch to the left aDDears

 re-establishing its authority soon, it is possible

 USSR-US: CRITICISM OF SCHLESINGER
 The Soviet media have reacted sharply to
 Defense Secretary Schlesinger's recent remarks
 on   US  nuclear  employment policy, con?
 centrating on the political rather than the mili-
 tary significance of his statements.
 The most definitive response appeared in
 Pravda  on July 12 under the authoritative
 "Observer" by-line. The article condemned the
 Secretary's  comments as  "bellicose state-
 ments...in sharp contradiction" to US-Soviet
 security negotiations and to detente in general.
 It said he was reverting to the "bankrupt"
 strategies of the Cold War and flouting the
 intent of the bilateral agreement on prevention
 of nuclear war by raising the possibility that
 nuclear weapons would be used in any crisis
 situation. These points recall similar Soviet
 criticism of the Secretary since early 1974 for
 his comments on US targeting doctrine.
 Soviet commentator; have attempted to
 explain the recent statements in terms of an
 internal debate in the US over foreign policy
 following the withdrawal from Southeast Asia.
 The Pravda article accused the Secretary of
 being a spokesman for those hewing to the
 "militarist dogmas of the past." It and other
 Soviet commentaries have said that his remarks
 were part of a Pentagon effort to win approval
 for the US military budget.
 The media have drawn liberally from US
 critics of Schlesinger's comments in an effort to
 show that they are counter to the mainstream of
 US opinion. Nevertheless, the Soviets betrayed
 some concern over the implications of his state-
 ments for administration policy. Noting that the
 Secretary is a prominent member of the US
 government, one commentator asked why this
 moment was chosen for a discussion which
 "certainly doesn't facilitate the course Wash-
 ington professes to follow."
 While cicarly peeved, the Soviets have not
 used the Secretary's statements to call publicly
 for greater defense efforts of their own. One
 correspondent mildly observed that the best
 reply to opponents of detente is "concrete
 deeds" to improve international understanding.
 Moscow's support for a successful CSCE summit
 and its campaign to play up the prospect of
 moving from political to military detente sug-
 gest a continuing desire to Durst,e better rela-
 USSR-FRANCE: CHILL IN RELATIONS
 French Foreign Ministry officials believe
 that the USSR is disappointed with President
 Giscard's foreign policy, but are optimistic that
 his trip to Moscow in October will clear the air.
 They are not worried about adverse effects on
 bilateral relations.
 The most recent manifc;;tation of a "chill"
 in French Soviet relations is The vitriolic attack
 by the Soviet news agency, Tass,, on French
 Minister of the Interior Poniatowski earliFr this
 month.  Poniatowski was  condemned  for
 asserting  that the "Poiiomarev document"
 recently published in a French newspaper wa.,
 not a fraud, as claimed by the French Com-
 munist Party, but a Soviet guideline for seizure
 of power by communist parties.           . 25X1
 Moscow  could  hardly  have  ignored
 Poniatowski's remarks, in view of strong Soviet.
 protestations that the document was a forgery
 trur,ped up by the Portuguese Socialists to
 discredit the Soviets and the Portuguese Com-
 munists. The French nevertheless assume that
 the Soviet attack on Giscard's closest political
 a;sociate was also a thinly veiled signal to the
 French president on other issues
 particularly concerrocd about the possibility of a

 secret agreement between Paris and Bonn that
 would  allow French Pluton tactical nuclear
 missiles to be stationed in West Germany. The
 Soviets fear that an agreement on Pluton could
 enhance the prospects for an  independent
 European defense,  which  Moscow strongly
 opposes. Moscow may have viewed its blast at
 Poniatowski as an opportunity to weigh in with
 Giscard prior to the French - West German
 summit meeting at the end of this month.
 Paris and Bonn continue to deny that there
 are  plans  for stationing Plutons  in West
 Germany,    although  the  French  and West
 German military planners are probably making
 contingency plans to use the Pluton in the event
 of hostilities.
 Giscard has already shown he is aware of
 Soviet concerns in this area. Last May, he
 sympathized  with  Soviet  fears  of an
 independent European defense arrangement and
 suggested the problem not be addressed until
 more political unification has been achieved. His
 statement was widely criticized in France as a
 concession to the Soviets.
 French-Soviet relations  have suffered
 other, more minor irritants in the past two
 months.  According to  French officials, the
 irr'tants include Giscard's termination of V-E
 Day celebrations in France and his visit to
 Poland  in mid-June. The Soviets were also
 annoyed by the several strong attacks on the
 USSR made by Chinese Vice Premier Teng
 Hsiao-Ping during his visit to Paris in mid-May.

 EUROPEAN COMMUNISTS: DIFFERENCES
 Differences  between the more  inde-
 pendent-minded parties and those loyal to Mos-
 cow continue to hamper preparations for a con-
 feience of European Communist parties.
 A high-level official in the Yugoslav For-
 ei~7n Ministry recently told the US ambassador
 in   Belgrade that another sharp division of
 opinion had emerged when the working group
 met in  East Berlin in early July to draft
 documents  for the conference. The Yugoslav
 said that  delegations from the Yugoslav,
 Romanian, Italian, Spanish, and French parties
 opposed positions taken by the Soviets and their
 Danish  and  East German supporters.  The
 absence of East European commentary on the
 East Berlin sessi(-n also points to a failure to
 make progress on the key issue-the refusal of
 the independents to accept any binding doc-
 ument.
 If the French party-which has previously
 supported Soviet goals-has now joined those
 resisting Moscow's will, the tide may, for the
 moment, be running against the Soviets and
 their allies. The  Italian  Communist Party's
 recent sharp attack on Czechoslovakia's suppres-
 sion of liberals from the "Prague Spring" may
 also signal a breakdown in the restraint needed
 to achieve an amicable resolution of some issues
 facing the working group.
 Such discord evidently has already caused
 he Soviets to abandon their original goal of
 holding the European conference on the heels of
 the European Security Conference summit.
 Nevertheless, efforts to resolve the problems
 continue. .A sub-group met in Berlin this week
 to try to tind language that could bridge the
 ideological gap.
 According to a Yugoslav party representa-
 tive, Moscow is staging a seles-tive show of
 reasonableness in an Effort to convince some of
 the independents taut Soviet concessions are
 still possible. The Soviets want to attract he
 maximum number of European parties to the
 formal meeting in Berlin in an effort to get their
 signatures on a joint document, no matter how
 bland. With such a show of Communist "unity,"
 the Soviets would be in a stronger position to
 line up participants for aintern tional party
 gathering.                              25X1
 EASTERN EUROPE: FLOODS AND HARVEST
 Early this month, heavy rains and flooding
 hit Eastern Europe and Yugoslavia at the start
 of the harvest season, causing major losses of
 grains and other crops. By contrast, the grain
 crop in East Germany is in trouble because of
 severe drought.
 Eastern Europe had been headed for an
 excellent harvest. In mid-June, grain output, in-
 cluding that of Yugoslavia, was forecast at about
 95 million tons, almost 6 percent greater than in
 1974. Based on early weather damage repirts,
 grain losses of i -)ughly 9 million tons are now
 likely. Losses  nay  run higher if the rising
 Danube causes more flooding in Romania.
 Flood waters have receded in Czechoslo-
 vakia, Hungary, and Yugoslavia. So far, the
 number  of  fatalities is  unknown;  Romania
 reported  that 60  persons died.     Although
 thousands of persons were evacuated in rural
 areas, major urban centers reportedly sustained
 little damage, and the floods caused only minor
 disruption to industry.
 According to the minister of agriculture
 total grain loss is expected to reach about 1.5
 million tons-equal to more than 10 percent of
 last year's harvest. In addition, significant losses
 of sugar beets, potatoes, vegetables, fruit, and
 livestock have occurred.
 More than half of Romania's 3:) counties
 suffered flood damage, with the greatest part in
 the central and southern regions of the country
 where some 60 percent of Romania's wheat and
 corn is produced. Emergency directives call for
 resowing damaged areas with summer crops

 The Arabs this week underlined their im-
 patience with what they believe are Israel's
 stalling tactics in negotiations. An announce-
 ment by Egypt denying further approval for the
 presence of UN troops in the Sinai Peninsula
 coincided with the start-at a conference of
 Islamic foreign ministers in Jidda-of a campaign
 to threaten  Israel's expulsion from the UN.
 Israel has taken the developments in stride, re-
 affirming its refusal to act under pressure.
 Egypt Forces the Pace
 Obviously displeased with the slow pace of
 negotiations on an interim agreement with
 Israel, Egypt increased its pressure for more
 rapid movement by declaring on July 15 that it
 cannot now agree to renew the UN mandate in
 the Sinai. The mandate expires on July 24.
 Beyond this announcement-which was itself
 qualified-the Egyptians have left their inten-
 tions deliberately vague. In a letter to UN Secre-
 tary General Waldheim and at a press confer-
 ence, Foreign Minister Fahmi said that Egypt
 does not oppose "the propel use" of the UN
 force, implying that Cairo might not object if
 the UN Security Council proceeded to renew
 the mandate without express Egyptian consent.
 action that would induce Egypt to permit con-
 tinuation of the UN presence in Sinai. An A l-
 Ahram editor who is close to Fahmi declared in
 an editorial in mid-week that the Egyptians "do
 not want appeals and calls for restraint; we want
 firm and useful action" from the UN.
 In justifying Egypt's case for withholding
 approval at this time of a UN mandate exten-
 sion, Fahmi has argued that Israel is using the
 UN force to perpetuate its occupation of Arab
 territory. All Security Council resolutions estab-
 lishing and extending the UN mandate, Fahmi
 contends, had envisioned the UN force as a
 factor assisting in the search for peace, but in-
 stead, Israel has exploited the quiet brought by
 the UN troops in order to stall on negotiations.
 The timing of the announcement is clearly
 designed to signal the limits of Egypt's patience
 and to put more steam into the negotiating
 process. Fahmi has made it clear that Egypt still
 welcomes US efforts to mediate an interim
 agreement.
 As an added means of pressure, the Egyp-
 tians placed their armed forces on alert imme-
 diately after the announcement and ma
 point of informing the US of the move.
 Later statements by Egyptian officials,
 however, suggest that Cairo might not give even
 its tacit consent unless Israel reaches agreement
 on a disengagement before the mandate deadline
 or the Security Council adopts a resolution that
 does more than merely call for an Israeli with-
 drawal.
 Waldheim has
 also announced it is his understanding that the
 Egyptians want a resolution that will assist in
 "implementing" previous Security Council deci-
 sions on Israeli withdrawal.
 Fahmi has hinted that Egypt might press
 for imposition of economic or other sanctions
 on Israel. He may be suggesting that sanctions-
 which the Egyptians could interpret as tangible
 pressure on  Israel to "implement" a with-
 drawal-constitute the only Security Council
 said Egypt's present intention is to avoid large-
 scale military movements except in response to
 Israeli movements. Fahmi has announced that
 "for the time being" Egypt will not change
 force levels in the restricted zone east of the
 Suez Canal.

 Tel Aviv's reaction to the Egyptian state-
 ments has been low-key so far. Government
 officials, in commenting to the press, stressed
 that Israel still will not be pressured into an
 agreement with  Egypt under the threat of
 deadlines.
 moval of Israel from the General Assembly,
 from UN specialized bodies, and from any con-
 ference held under UN auspices.
 Prime Minister Rabin's handling of the
 issue in a speech to the Knesset was restrained,
 and he reiterated his determination to continue
 to seek another interim agreement with Egypt.
 He warned, however, that Cairo must respect
 the disengagement agreement now in effect-of
 which the UN forces are an "integral" part-if it
 expects Israel to honor its end of the bargain.
 Rabin added that "whoever" wishes the nego-
 tiations for another agreement with Egypt to
 Sontinue "in an approprate atmosphere" should
 refrain from any action that might increase ten-
 sions. Israel has already asked for another six-
 month extension of the UN forces mandate in
 the Sinai.
 Israeli press treatment reflected a strong
 undercurrent of doubt in Israel that Cairo is in
 fact prepared to carry out its threat not to ask
 for a renewal of the UN forces mandate. Corn-
 ment;,i:ors implied that the government should
 ca!I the Egyptians' bluff.
 Meanwhile, the ability of those Israelis who
 oppose a more flexible negotiating position to
 mobilize large segments of the population in
 support of their stand was demonstrated again
 this week. A crowd of approximately 15,000
 gathered in Tel Aviv on July 15 to protest any
 further Israeli territorial concessions in the Sinai
 in the absence of a clear Egyptian commitment
 to non-belligerency.
 Syrian Moves
 An Arab campaign to exclude Israel from
 the UN appears to be gaining momentum. With
 Syrian Foreign Minister Khaddam in the lead,
 the Islamic foreign ministers' conference this
 week adopted a resolution calling for the re-
 A similar resolution is expected to be
 offered at the Organization of African Unity
 summit meeting to be held in Kampala from
 July 28 to August 3. In recent years, the Afri-
 cans have given strong backing to the Arabs in
 return for Arab support ror the termination of
 white minority rule in southern Africa. The
 Palestine  Liberation Organization  has  been
 invited to address the summit and can be ex-
 pected to use the meeting to solicit support for
 the anti-Israeli campaign. The Syrians will not
 be present so the Algerians will probably spon-

 ANGOLA: ANOTHER ROUND
 After almost a week of intense fighting in
 Luanda, the Popular Movement for the Libera-
 tion of Angola forced the rival National Front
 for the Liberation of Angola to withdraw from
 the city. The latest round of clashes may also
 have destroyed the territory's fragile six-month-
 old transitional government-a development that
 could seriously disrupt Lisbon's decolonization
 prc gram for Angola.
 With  the fighting in the capital going
 against the Front, its senior representative in the
 transitional  government, Johnny Eduardo
 Pinnock, and a number of other Front officials
 fled to the organization's headquarters in Zaire.
 In a subsequent press conference in Kinshasa,
 Pinnock announced that he was resigning from
 his position. He also claimed that the Popular
 Movement is now controlled by "extremists"
 who have pushed aside the group's long-time
 leader, Agostinho Neto.
 Pinnock's resignation, which carried an
 assertion that the National Front is mobilizing
 for full-scale war, was probably designed in large
 part to prod the Portuguese into imposing a
 truce through force of arms. Such a truce may
 be the  Front's only chance to pull  itself
 together. With the exception of a few small
 garrisons scattered around  the environs of
 Luanda, the Front is now isolated in its tribal
 base in northwestern Angola, separated from the
 capital by territory controlled by the Popular
 Movement. It is probably low on arms and sup-
 plies and in no position to wage sustained war at
 the present time.
 The military rulers in Lisbon, who have
 considerable prestige invested in their effort to
 lead Angola to independence next November,
 will probably try to convince the National Front
 to return to the government. The Front is
 unlikely to return unless the Portuguese can
 guarantee peace in the territory, at least until
 national elections can be held. It is probably too
 late For that, however. Although some 24,000
 Portuguese troops remain in the territory, there
 is a real danger they would refuse to intervene
 between  the two hostile  liberation groups.
 Agostinho Neto
 Moreover, troops in Portugal might well refuse
 to go to Angola at this juncture.
 Portuguese Foreign Minister Antunes, who
 made a quick visit to Luanda during the height
 of the fighting, was unable to arrange a cease-
 fire. He subsequently informed UN Secretary
 General Waldheim that Lisbon may have to take
 "emergency measures" in the territory. Antunes
 hinted last Sunday night prior to his departure
 for Luanda that Lisbon might have to appeal to
 the UN in order to protect the decolonization
 process.
 Wh...tever the Portuguese and he National
 Front may have in mind, the Popular Movement
 appears determined to score a military victory
 against its competitors, including the National
 Union for the Total Independence of Angola,
 the smallest of the three liberation groups. The
 National Union has refused to take sides in the
 fighting between its larger rivals but on several
 occasions has been attacked by she Ponular

 MALAGASY REPUBLIC: NASA OUT
 On July 11, President Ratsiraka closed
 down all operations at the NASA tracking
 station near Tananarive and  pl.:;.ed the
 facility under control of the army. Ratsiraka
 had told the US charge the day before that
 the station would have to close because of
 Washington's refusal to make back rental
 payments.
 The agreement allowing the US to
 operate the station, which had been reached
 with a previous regime, expired at the end of
 1973.  Ratsiraka, who was then foreign
 minister, demanded rent amounting to $10
 million for the period that had expired as
 the price for renewing the agreement. He
 again pressed for such a payment after gain-
 ing power last month. The US, while reject-
 ing Ratsiraka's demand, did agree to pay an
 annual rent of $100,000 from 1973.
 The closure of the station has had no

 ISRAEL-FEDAYEEN: RETRIBUTION
 Tel Aviv ceiducted two attacks a week
 apurt on fedayeen bases in southern Lebanon in
 retaliation for the terrorist bombing in Jeru-
 salem :,,i July 4. Fourteen Israelis were killed
 and sorr,e 70 people wounded in that incident.
 Israeli air, naval, and ground forces first
 attacked on July 6, concentrating on guerrilla
 bases near the coastal city of Tyre. Tel Aviv
 announced that all of its forces returned safely,
 and press reports indicated that at least 1.3
 Arabs were killed and some 20 were wounded.
 The fedayeen and Lebanese said that one
 Israeli jet was downed and the crew captured.
 Israel  disputed  fedayeen  and  Lebanese
 announcements and claimed that all Israeli air-
 craft had returned safely. The fedayeen dis-
 played a parachute as proof that th' Israeli pilot
 had bailed out over Lebanon, but it actually is a
 dray chute used to slow down aircraft during
 landing. The chute apparently was dislodged
 from the Israeli aircraft by an SA-7, and the
 ',lane probably returned to base, even though
 damaged.
 In the second attack on July 13, Israeli
 planes struck what Tel Aviv termed a terrorist
 workshop producing war materials. The shop
 serves a fedayeen base, which has bean attacked
 previously. The base is in or near Ayn al Hilweh,
 the largest Palestinian camp in Lebanon. Press
 reports indicated that four persons were killed
 and some 20 wounded in the raid.
 SA-7 and other antiaircraft fire from the
 fedayeen may prompt the Israelis to change
 their ground attack procedures but will not
 deter there from more raids.
 Foreign Minister Allon last week defended
 Israeli raids on the fedayeen during a conversa-
 tion with members of a US congressional delega-
 tion. He pointed out that there had been a series
 of terrorist incidents in Israel to which Tel Aviv
 had not responded. This, he said, might have
 encouraged the perpetrators of the terrorist
 bombing in Jerusalem on July 4. That incident,
 he stressed, had reaffirmed Tel Aviv's conviction
 that the terrorists could not be allowed to
 operate with impunity. Nevertheless, he went
 on, the raid on July 7 was ordered only after a
 lengthy discussion within the government and
 after it was decided that every effort would be
 made to select targets with a view to minir,iizing
 civilian casualties.

 Independence Declared
 One of the final rounds In the breakup of
 France's once extensive overseas empire is being
 played out on the Comoro archipelago in the
 Mozambique channel. The legislature of the
 Comoro  Islands declared the  islands Inde-
 pendent on July 6. The status of one Island?
 Mayotte-is still In doubt, however; its inhabi-
 tants want to remain part of France.
 The Islands are a major source of the base
 essence used by the French perfume industry
 and have hau a large measure of internal self-
 government since  1961.  Independence was
 abruptly declared by the Comorian government
 to counter the effect of a bill passed in late June
 by the French National Assembly. The bill pro-
 vided for the independence of the archipelago
 later this year, but allowed each of the islands to
 vote separately on a proposed independence
 constitution. This would have permitted the
 Mahorais-the Inhabitants of Mayotte--to end
 their association with the other islands and
 make Mayotte a French department.
 In a referendum last December, over 60
 percent of the Mahorais opted to retain links
 with France, while the people on the other three
 islands voted overwhelmingly in favor of inde-
 pendence, There is heavy French and Christian
 influence in the Mahorais' culture, in contrast to
 the Muslim culture that is predominant on the
 other  islands. Mayotte political  leaders de-
 nounced the independence,declaration as illegal,
 and are demanding that France maintain its
 authority on the island. Ahmed Abdallah, the
 new chief of state, has vowed to keep Mayotte a
 part of the Comoros.
 otto. Paris is trying to locate a middle ground
 h,Aween  Moroni-the Comorian capital-and
 Mayotte, but it will not be easy.
 France Is concerned that retaining Mayotte
 will subject Paris to charges of attempting to
 perpetuate a colonial arrangement, in order to
 ensure France a military presence in the Indian
 Ocean. France is already under increasing criti-
 cism from African and Arab countries because
 of its continuing hold on the French Territory
 of Afars and Issas.
 Relations between the Comorian govern-
 ment and France will be strained if Paris finally
 agrees to retain Mayotte. The Comorians might
 refrain from an open break because of their
 reliance on French aid. A cooling of relations,
 however, would probably encourage the Co-
 morians  to  seek  assistance from Muslim
 countries.
 Libya has shown an interest in the islands;
 several delegations have visited the Comoros,
 and Abda{lah visited Tripoli in March. Saudi
 Arabia may provide some aid to prevent the
 islands from falling under radical Arab influ-
 ence. Iran may also be willing to help.

 Paris is willing to acc'pt the Comoros' in-
 dependence, but it is keeping its options open
 regarding Mayotte. The government issued a
 communique this week saying it would "take

 did not explicitly support Mayotte separatism.

 ARGENTINA: CRISIS CONTINUING
 President Peron has been seriously weak-
 ened by political and economic otbacks doririg
 the past two weeks, and then are no indications
 that anyone within the government is capable of
 halting her deteriorating position.
 Lopez Roga has been ousted horn his offi-
 cial posts and has moved out of the presidential
 residence, but it is widely believed that he is still
 advising Mrs. Peron. Military, labor, and Poroni,t
 political leaders will continue to urge the Presi-
 dent to end his influence.
 The crisis is likely to be protracted. Lopez
 Pega's opponents still would prefer that Mrs.
 Peron remain in the presidency, and they seem
 content for the time being to wait for her to
 make the next move. They now appear prepared
 to accept her resignation, or even force her

 most of the economic austerity program he out-
 lined on June 30. He is totally discrodited, how-
 over, and may soon be forced to resign. Strikes
 and work stoppages are occurring dally In vari-
 ous cities as concern grows that even the recent,
 massive wage hikes soon will be oaten up by
 soaring inflation. Moreover, leftists within the
 labor movement are seeking to exploit the cur-
 rent tonsion and widen  the  gulf between
 workers and their top leaders. Some unions are
 jealous because their wage increases did not
 match those of other unions.
 Though there is no evidence of active plot-
 ting against the government, the likelihood of
 Mrs. Peron remaining in office until the election
 in 1977 has diminished considerably. By cling-
 ing to the hated Lopez Rega, the President has
 alienated labor and Peronist political leaders at a
 time when economic problems have reached
 crisis proportions. The economy alone would
 have severely taxed the skills of a strong, charis-
 matic leader. Since Mrs. Peron is neither, the
 added problems caused by her association with
 Lopez Rega ma  be more than she can handle.
 PERU: NONALIGNED CONFERENCE
 Latin America will provide the dais for the
 next rhetorical attack on imperialism by the
 nonaligned conference. As the region has shifted
 away from the US toward the Third World, it
 has produced a rotating leadership among the
 more aggressive proponents of an in!erriational
 reformation. Venezuela. Mexico, and Peru en-
 gage in an active but friendly competition for
 the global spotlight as spokesmen for the area.
 The first two will share stardom as launchers of
 a new regional organization, a Latin American
 Economic System, probably at the beginning of
 August. Then Peru will take its turn, as host for
 the foreign ministers conference of the non-
 aligned on August 25-29.
 The Lima site for the meeting underlines
 the growing ease with which the Latins play the
 Third World role. Only a few years ago, the
 Latins saw little common ground with the gen-
 erally loss developed Asian and African regions
 and shied away from communist regimes. In
 1970, Cuba was the solo full-fledged member of
 the nonal;gnod conference. By 1973, seven Latin
 and Caribbean nations attended the summit at
 Algiers as full members; eight wont as observers;
 one was "present." Now the Latins are often
 instigators of Third World issues in the UN and
 other world forums, especially on economic
 matters.
 Venezuela and Mexico have been particu-
 larly agile at maintaining an ambidextrous for-
 eign policy that allows for a productive and
 cordial relationship with the US and at the same
 time strengthens their place with the lesser do-
 veloped. Peru had begun to bond somewhat
 away from its more clearly adversary role vis-a-
 vis the US, but the interest of moderates in the
 Peruvian  leadership in casing tensions with
 Washington will not put a brake on Lima's in-
 dulgence in Third Worldism.
 The minority of Latin states that hew un.
 abashedly to a pro-US position continues to
 shrink. Even the Somoza government in Nicara-
 gua has begun to examine ways to exhibit dif-
 f-rences with Washington in order to avoid iso;a-
 tiun from the mainstream of Latin America.
 The Lima conference, coming immediately
 prior to the opening of the 7th Special Session
 of the United Nations, will be the major point
 of coordination for the Third World positions at
 New York. Many contentious issues will be
 topical, and sources of friction and division
 among the nonaligned continue to be many.
 Cuba, for example, has already attacked the oil
 producers as a budding new privileged minority.
 The pressure for unity nevertheless remains
 powerful, and will probably be further strength-
 ened as the group begins to react to recent
 warnings from Washington ahni,t its, rnln in the

 pMIcoful solutions are closed to a country, Ihen
 it must resort to solutions that are not peace-
 ful."
 The Panamanian leader is also concerned
 about rising criticism at home of his handling of
 the negotiations. He has raised expectations for
 an advantageous treaty within a fairly short time
 frame and feels compelled to produce concrete
 results, r\ prolonged delay, he fears, will provide
 ammunition to critics and weaken popular port for his regime.
 According  to  the  pro-government
 Panamanian Student Federation, the administra-
 tion is already taking several steps to bolster its
 canal negotiating position. The opening of a
 dialogue with various sectors of the society is
 the first move. In the international arena, there
 will be oven more emphasis on establishing
 diplomatic  relations with  all countries (the
 USSR  and       China could conic soon)  and
 strengthening ties with Third World countries.
 At the UN, efforts will be increased to assure
 Panama a seat on the Security Council, and the
 canal issue will be submitted to the General
 Assembly.
 Panamanian leader General Omar Torrijos
 is laying the groundwork for a campaign to
 demonstrate his frustration about the ck'ay in
 negotiations on a new canal treaty. Torrijos told
 student leaders on July 9 that he no longer felt
 bound to preserve the confidentiality of the
 talks because the US government had breached
 the secrecy agreement. He thus loft the door
 open to release those facts that would increase
 public support of his canal stand.
 Although for the present Torrijos may be
 leaning toward this fairly moderate course, he
 may decide relatively soon that he should give
 Washington a preview of what to expect if a new
 treaty is not signed. He could choose to use
 carefully  controlled  student  demonstrations,
 perhaps  involving  minor  harassment  of  US
 citizens, to demonstrate Panama's unhappiness
 with the present situation.
 The briefing for the students, the first in a
 series of meetings Torrijos intends to hold with
 various groups, is probably intended to signal his
 annoyance at the lack of recent progress in the
 talks,  the  indications  of opposition  to the
 negotiations by members of the US Congress,
 and the pessimistic zrticles in the US press about
 the future of the talks. In statements to the
 I,ress in early July, Torrijos declared: "When all
 At least initially, Torrijos would consider
 such actions a necessary tactical move and not a
 reversal of his view that negotiation is the best
 way to achieve Panama's canal goals. If these
 actions failed to produce forward movement, he
 could rapidly marshal students and other groups
 for more serious demonstrations that could
 eventually  lead  to a confrontation.

 PHILIPPINES: UNFINISHED BUSINESS
 Buoyed by his successful visit to China,
 President Marcos Is now turning his attention to
 two other foreign policy Issues: recognition of
 thk Soviet Union and renegotiation of the US
 military bases agreerent. He considers resolu-
 tion of these matters an integral part of his drive
 for more balanced international relations.
 On the Philippine-US base issue, Marcos'
 staff recently submitted a proposal that calls for
 Philippine mananemeni and use of the bases for
 commercial as well as for military purposes. This
 is probably one of a range of options that
 Marcos  will  consider  prior  to  entering
 negotiations.
 Most of the preliminary negotiations for
 diplomatic ties were completed over a year ago,
 but discussions on the proposed Philippine-
 Soviet trade agreement have been stalled over
 most-favored-nation status,  the channels for
 handling the trade, and the status of trade
 representatives  to be assigned.  Moreover,
 Manila's most recent draft is more restrictive
 than the one just signed with Peking, and
 Moscow  is  likely  to  hold out  for  equal
 treatment. A Philippine trade delegation is in
 Moscow, and a Soviet one will soon arrive in
 Manila to try to iron out remaining difficulties.

 Page  19 WEEKLY REVIEW   Jul 18, 75
 In recent public statements on the bases,
 Marcos and his advisers have taken a more
 moderate tone than they did before his trip to
 China in early June. Marcos is now publicly
 str,assing  that  whatever  arrangements are
 eventually worked out must allow the US to
 maintain an effective presence in the western
 Pacific. Manila's controlled press is also now
 parroting this line, a marked change from its
 flamboyant anti-US style of some weeks ago.
 The Philippine negotiating position on a
 future base agreement is likely to be heavily
 influenced by the course of current US-Spanish
 base negotiations. Marcos is closely monitoring
 the talks with Madrid, particularly discussions
 about compensation for the bases and ioint use

 Prima Minister Whitlam scored a qualified
 victory Monday when the Labor Party caucus
 supported his firing of former deputy prime
 minister Cairns two weeks ago, There was, how-
 ever,  considerable criticism  of Whitlam's
 tendency to act without consulting the caucus.
 Whitlam probably had some anxiety about
 the outcome of the caucus vote, since only a
 year ago the caucus selected Cairns as deputy
 leader over Whitlam's chosen candidate. Even
 though only about 15 of the 95 caucus members
 are regarded as part of Cairns' left wing, many
 more have a high personal regard for the former
 deputy.
 The caucus tempered its backing of the
 dismissal, however, by selecting Overseas Trade
 Minister  Frank Crean to  replace Cairns as
 deputy prime minister. Although Crean, like
 Whitlam, is a party moderate, relations between
 the two men soured last November when Whit-
 lam fired Crean as federal treasurer. The move
 was widely criticized in Australia as an attempt
 by the Prime Minister to make Crean the scape-
 goat for the government's ineffective economic
 policies.
 Although Whitlam has survived the party
 crisis, he still faces intense parliamentary ques-
 tioning on the circumstances of Cairns' dis-
 missal. The opposition Liberal-Country coalition
 is pressing for creation of a royal commission to
 look into allegations that Cairns or his associates
 stood to make huge profits from foreign loan
 deals and that they had misrepresented private
 ventures as government business. The opposi-
 tion-controlled Senate has also called for testi-
 mony from public service officials who might be
 able to shed some light on the loans con-
 troversy.  Whitlam's resistance  to this move
 could briny additional trouble in the Senate.
 For the moment, the opposition seems
 content to spotlight the government's alleged
 misdeeds through parliamentary investigation. It
 probably feels that this will provide campaign
 grist for the national election that could come
 later this year.

 VIETNAM: RECOVERY UNSPECTACULAR
 Hanoi has had better than two years since
 the signing of the cease-fire arrangements in
 South Vietnam to rebuild the economy of
 North Vietnam. Overall growth during 1973 and
 1974 was unspectacular, and clearly less than
 Hanoi had hoped. Moreover, the take-over of
 South  Vietnam  is complicating  plans for
 development of the North over the next few
 years.
 Nfter the cease-fire, Hanoi rapidly restored
 the   bomb-damaged transporation, electric
 power, and small modern indu:?:.ial sectors, its
 priority objective3. Transport a.tivity increased
 as roads and bridges were repaired. Reconstruc-
 tion of the Thac Ba hydroelectric power plant,
 the Uong Bi and Thai Nguyen thermal power
 plants and construction of a new thermal plant
 at Nine Binh restored nearly all of the electric
 power capacity that existed before the bomb-
 ings; 75 percent had been knocked out in 1972.
 The reconstruction effort as a whole, however,
 was makeshift and shoddy.
 There were some gains in production in
 1974, but attempts to restore output to pre-war
 levels  in  iron and steel, cement,  chemical
 fertilizers, and coal were only partially success-
 ful. Extensive damage surveys and shortages of
 electric power, fuel, and raw materials and
 technical skills combined to delay the start of
 reconstruction.
 Output from light industry and handi-
 crafts-which except for textiles emerged f,om
 the bombing relatively free of direct damage-
 grew                   moderately with the improvement in
 transportation facilities, raw material supplies,
 and  electric  power availability.  Repairs to
 damaged textile plants, including those at Nam
 Dinh and Haiphong, and construction of new
 ones probably restored most of the country's
 textile production capacity.
 Agriculture still dominates the economy,
 accounting for 35-40 percent of national output
 and employing 70 percent of the civilian labor
 force, but this sectc,- has lagged because of lack
 of investment and muddled policies. Rice yields
 are still among the lowest in Asia, attributable
 to insufficient irrigation, water-control facilities,
 farm machinery, and high quality fertilizers.
 Rice output stagnated  in  1973  as adverse
 weather damaged the autumn harvest, but last
 year output was up 10 percent under favorable
 growing conditions.
 Hanoi has leaned heavily on its communist
 allies for cr-modity and capital assistance. Aid
 jumped from $425 million in 1972 to about
 $600 million in 1973 and then to $1.2 billion in
 1974.
 Las'  December,  Hanoi  adopted  an
 ambitious  20-percent target for economic
 growth in 1975, but this now appears u;iattain-
 able even Though substantial industrial growth
 can be expected as restoration and expansion of
 large plants are completed. Hanoi simply did not
 anticipate the military take-over of the South in
 April, which has forced the North to focus
 attention on improving security, administering
 the government, and reviving the economy in
 the South.
 Growth prospects beyond the next year or
 so are likely to get worse before they get better,
 despite a  large  labor force and  relatively
 abundant natural  resources.  North Vietnam
 lacks the management skills, technical compe-
 tence, and incentives to grow quickly. The
 transition to economic integration of the North
 with the South will require major adjustmants in
 Hanoi's investment, production, and distribu-
 tion plans. For this reason, Hanoi scrapped its
 earlier 1976-80 five-year plan and will probably
 replace it with a new one that will scale down
 economic targets in the North in order to devote
 some resources to socialization of the South's
 economy. Finally, Hanoi probably cannot count
 on receiving as much foreign aid as in the past,
 since the USSR and East European countries are
 insisting on closer supervision of aid flows in the
 future than they did durinn the war.
