					  	Xiaoping  revealed  Tuesday  China  has  repeatedly  suggested  that  the  United
					  	States  tr�y  vigorously  to  get  into  direct  contact  with  Nortt:  Korea.    	The		    	-
	    	_			    	disclosurP  was  made  at  a  meeting  with  a  six-man  delegation  of  the  Japanese
					  	House  of  CouncilZors,   	led  by  upper  house  Vice  President  Chozo  Akiyama.
	    	=			    	The  group  arrived  here  Monday  iar  a  week-lon~  visit  to  this  country.    	At
					  	tha  meeting  in  the  Great  Hall  of   	thE  People,  Deng  set  forth  China':~  vlew~s
					  	on  the  current  world  situation,   	especially  Afghanistan  and  Korea.    	On  the
					  	divided  Korean  peninsula,  Deng  ruled  out  anew  the  possibility  of  North
					  	Korea  launching  a  military  attack  upon  the  Republic  of  Korea.    	He  was
					  	quoted  as  saying  some  Japanese  quarters  are  concerned  about  the  North's
					  	possible  thrust  i.nto  the  South,  but  the  North  restrained  itself  when  Presi-
					  	dent  Pak  Chung-hui  was  slain  last  October  26.    	He  also  sai.d  the  Americans
					  	should  attempt  a~  a  direct  approach  to  the  Democratic  People's  Republic  oF
					  	Korea,  adding  China  has  repeatedly  advised  the  U.S.   	ta  do  so.    	The  isaue

					  	ROLE  OF  ARMY  AFTER  PAK'S  ASSASSINATION  DESCRIBID
					  	Tokyo  MAINICHI  SHIMBUN  in  Japanese  23  Nov  79  p  4
					  	[Article  by  S.   	Shigemura:    	"Season  of  Politics  in   	South   	Korea"]
					  	[Text]    	It  has  been  about  a  month  since  the  death  of  President  Pak.
					  	Korea  is  moving  out  of  the  period  of  presidential  mourning  and  into
					  	"the  season  of  politics."    	Party  activities  directed  toward  electing  the
					  	next  president  and  reforming  th^.  constitution  have  stepped  up.    	It  is
					  	viewed  that  the  military,  which  supported  the  Pak  gove:~nme*~t  will  play  a
					  	significant  part   	in  determining  the  direction  of  Korean  politics.
					  	Whenever  people  in  Seoul  talk  about  their  desire  for  "change  occuriiig
		 	-			 	in  an  atmosphere  of  stability,"  they  say  "avoiding  a  conflict  between  the
					  	political  parties  and  the  intention  of  the  military"  is  crucial.    	However,
					  	it  seems  that  no  one  knows  for  sure  how  the  military  operates  nor  how  it				-
					  	will  decide  its  direction.
					  	As  military  guards  gradually  disappeared  from  newspaper  offices  and  public
					  	buildings,   	assessment  of  two  military  leaders  grew--that  of  th~  Minister				-
					  	of  National  Defense  No  Chae-hyon,  who  declared  that  the  "the  military  will
					  	not  interfere  in  politics,"  and  Army  Chief  of  Staff  General  Chong  Sung-hw~,
					  	who  obstructed  the  coup  d'etat  of  Kim  Chae-kyu,  head  of  the  Korean  C.I.A.
					  	However,   	it  was  not  as  if  these  two  men  were  considered,  both  within  and
					  	outside  of  the  military,   	to  be  "excellent  military  men"  from  the  beginning.
					  	A  rumor  such  asy   	because  they  were  "incompetenC"  they  were  given  important
					  	positions,  was  constantly  heard.    	With  respect  to  meetings  and  matters  of
					  	personnel  of  the  top  military  men,  President  Pak  had  completa  authority.
					  	It  is  said  that  people  who  seemed  to  be  extending  their  power  and  were
					  	popular  within  the  military  were  always  rPmoved  from  important  posts.
					  	As  the  control  of  the  Martial  Law  Command  proceeded,   	the  people  of  Seoul
					  	felt  relieved  that  "the  military  is  under  civilian  control."    	The  report				-
					  	that  the  military  heads  "are  letting  specialists  completely  manage  the
					  	economy"  also  became  clear.    	On  6  November  military  guards  disappeared			   	-
			-			 	from  front  of  newspaper  offices  and  from  the  7th,  General  Chong  Sung-hwa
					  	and  Kim  Chong-hwan  stopped  attending  the  "emergency  measures  council."

				    	The  nature  of  Korea's  military  is  said  to  have  changed  greatly  since  the
				    	end  of  the  Korean  war.    	The  military  gives  short-term  training  to  talented
				    	people  who  have  been  chosen  from  low-ranking  officers  without  academic
				    	credentials  or  to  the  graduates  of  the  first  to  tenth  classes  of  the
				    	Military  Academy  who  have  experience  in  the  Chinese  or  in  the  former
				    	Japanese  army.    	It  was  after  the  Korean  War,  beginning  with  the  llth
				    	class,   	that  Soutt~  Korea  began  the  4-year  training  of  superior  high  school
				    	students,  as  it  is  done  at  the  U.S.  Military  Academy.
				    	With  Maj  Gen  Chon  Tu-hwan  who  investigated  President  Pak's  assassination
				    	at  the  top,  10  other  military  commanders  from  the  llth  class  Korean
				    	Milit:iry  Academy  occupying  the  position  of  major  general,  brigadier  general,
				    	and  division  commander  hold  the  real  power  of  the  fighting  units.    	It  was
		 	~		   	said  that  these  high-level  officers  have  common  experiencE  in  having
				    	studies  in  the  United  States  and  received  military  experience  in  foreign
				    	countries.    	They  have  first  hand  international  experience  and  have  deep
				    	understanding  of  democracy.
				    	This  class  of  young  army  officials  from  advanced-level  training  school
				    	flocked  to  President  Pak's  government.    	It  is  said  they  looked  severely
				    	at  the  politicians  and  businessmen  who  greedily  sought  a  piece  of  the
				    	action.    	Whenever  the  name  of  former  Prime  Minister  Kim  Chong-pil  came  up
				    	as  a  politician  who  will  shoulder  the  post-Pak  government,   	one  also  often
				    	heard:    	"If  he  is  not  popular  in  the  military,  well...."
				    	Former  Prime  Minister  Kim  Chong-pil  was  chosen  with  unexpected  speed  as
				    	the  new  president  of  the  Democratic  Republican  Party.    	Apart  from  the
				    	selection  of   	[government  officials],   	the  feeling  that  the  non-involvement
				    	of  the  military  as  "the  establishment  of  civilian  control"  is  growing
				    	stronger  among  the  people  of  Korea.

							 	President  Pak.    	Korea  has  quickly  moved  to  de-Pakization--
							  	that  is,   	from  a  despotic  system  to  a  freer  and  more  flex-
							  	ible  political  system.    	How  will  the  military,  which  is
							  	regarded  as  the  guardian  of  the  new  regime  and  the  focal
							 	pointof  the  movement,   	respond  to  this  move?    	Also,  what
							 	kind  of  effect  will  social  changes  in  South  Korea  brought				     	-
							 	about  by  remarkable  economic  development  have  on  de-Pakiza-
							  	tion.    	Following  is  an  attempt  to  forecast  the  future  of
							 	Korea  based  on  the  analyses  presented  by  the  retired						 	_
							 	general  Katsuichi  Tsukamoto,   	former  Japanese  military					     	=
		 	_						officer  who  was  stationed  in  Korea  and  an  expert  on  mili-				     	_
		 	_						tary  affairs  of  Korea;  Keitaro  Hasegawa,   	economic  commen-~

						By  5[November]   	the  government  and  the  military  appeared  to  have  firmed  up
						the  policy  to  establish  a  caretaker  government  with  Choe  Kyu-ha  as  the
						acting  president.    	That  the  military  will  wholeheartedly  support  civilian
						g~vernment  was  clear  as  Secretary  of  State  Vance  co~nented  after  attending
						on  the  3rd  the  state  funeral  of  the  late  President  Pak.    	The  re-emergence
				     	of  a  military  regime,   	the  point  the  U.S.  was  most  concerned  about,   	is
						expected  to  be  avoided.															    	-
						"Traditionally  the  Korean  military  has  p].ayed  a  strictly  neutral  role  in
				     	politics.    	When  the  Syngman  Rhee  regime  fell,   	the  military  did  not  make			    	-
				     	any  move.    	Even  when  a  coup  led  by  Pak  Chung-hui  came,  because  President			  	-
				     	Yun  Po-sun  stepped  down  for  the  revolutionary  forces,   	the  military
		 	'		    	completely  remained  in  position.    	It  is  unusual  that  the  military  which  has
				     	been  under  18  years  of  Pak's  rule,   	has  appeared  in  the  limelight.    	~resident
				     	Pak  Chung-hui  had  transferred  one  after  another  those  generals  who  showed
				     	interest  in  politics  or  high  ranking  officers  who  were  popular  among  troops

				   	r.o  the  first  reserve.    	With  the  situation  having  come  to  this,   	I  don't  think
				   	L-here  is  anyone  in  the  military  now  who  aims  to  take  over  the  government."
				    	(,Okai)
				   	Plcnetheless,   	the  military  cannot  be  expected  to  merely  sit  back  tight,   	ignor-
				   	ing  the  national  emergency.    	It  is  the  military  which  is  acutely  aware  of
				   	the  crisis  of  having  to  face  the  DPRK  (North  Korea)   	across  the  Dimilitarized
				   	Zone.
				   	The  military,   	as  the  guardian,  will  unmistakably  influence  the  new  post-Pak
				   	regime.    	The  high  ranking  officers  were  reported  to  have  agreed  to  discard
				   	the  Yusin  system,   	indicating  that   	the  behind  the  scene  military  intention
				   	is  the  key  to  the  decision  making  process.
				   	The  personnel  relationship  and  power  structure  within  the  military  establish-
				   	ment  of  Korea,   	show  that  it  is  the  army  personnel  who  have  the  political
		   	_			influence.    	From  the  organizational  point  of  view,   	the  leaders  who  currently
				   	F>ossess  real  power  are  said  to  be  three  full  gen~rals:    	Defense  Minister  No
				   	Chae-hyon   	(3rd  class  of  the  Military  Academy),   	Chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs
				   	of  Staff  Kim  Chong-hwan  (4th)   	and  Army  Chief  of  Staff  Chung  Sung-hwa   	(5th).
				   	Minister  No,   	despite  his  defense  ministerial  post,   	is  interested  only  in
		   	'			the  military  matters  and  is  considered  a  non-political  type  of  individual.
				   	Chairman  Kim  is  a  career  inte~_ligence  officer,  professionally  a  rival  of
				   	Kim  Chae-kyu   	(2nd  class),   	former  director  of  KCIA  andthe  man  responsible
				   	for  the  incident.    	Chairman  Kim  is  considered  to  be  quite  interested  in
		   	'			politics.    	The  Ar*ay  Chief  of  Staff  Chung  Sung-hwa  was  the  closest  among  the
				   	three  generals  to  Kim  Chae-kyu,  who  is  his  senior  in  the  military  and  has
				   	reportedly  felt  that  Chung  is  very  promising.										     	-
				   	Following  these  three  men,   	there  are  Yu  Pyong-hyon,  Deputy  Commanding  General,
				   	US-ROK  Allied  Command   	(7th  class),  Kim  Yong-hyu,  Beptty  Defense  Minister
				   	(7th  class)  and  Chon  Tu-hwan,   	a  younger  man  and  commanding  general  of  the
				   	Army  Security  Command   	(llth)   	class.
		   	_			General  Chon  Tu-hwan  was  hand-picked  by  President  Pak  when  he  served  as  a
				   	battalion  co~ander  of  the  Presidential  Security  Force.    	Normally,   	the  post
				   	of  the  commanding  general  of  the  Army  Security  Command  is  filled  by  a
				   	liet~tenant  general.    	It  is,   	therefore,  unusual  for  Ma~or  General  Cl~on  to
				   	assume  the  post;   	and  he  is  the  fastest  rising  star  among  his  fellow  classmates
				   	of  llth  class.
				   	An  observer  commented,   	"The.  appointment  of  Chon  Tu-hwan,  who  is  pro-Pak,   	to			   	r
				   	director  of  the  Joint  Investigation  Headquarters  under  the  Martial  Law
				   	Command  will  be  a  real  disadvantage  to  Kim  Chae-kyu.    	Lighter  sentence  and			    	'
		   	.			restoration  of  honor  seem  very  unlikely..."
				   	Within  the  military  establishment,   	there  is  a  considerable  gap  in  the  way  of
				   	thinking  between  the  senior  mili.tary  man,  who  participated  in  the  coup  d~etat				=

					 	of  18  years  ago   	and  supported  the  Pak  regime  thereafter  as  friends  and  aids,
					 	and  the  ~ffice rs  below  the  middle  management  level.
					 	In  the  Korean  army  there  was  a  time  when  the  rank  of  a  general  was  reported].y
					 	bought  and  sold  with  money.    	A  major  general  was  said  to  be  told  once,   	"Pay
		   	.		    	8  million  won  sa  you  can  be  promoted  to  lieutenant  general.    	If  you  need
					 	money  to  pay'off,   	I  will  arrange  for  you  to   	find  a  lender.    	That  sort  of
					 	money  can  easily  be  recovered  within  a  year  through  the  contribution  from
					 	subordinates."
					 	Having  been  told  this  by  his  superior,   	he  threw  a  letter  of.  resignation  at				-
					 	his  superior  an d  he  was  then  placed  on  reserve.    	This  kind  of  old  warrior			 	-
					 	spirit  seems  to  have  run  counter  to  the  professionalism  of  young  career
					 	officers.
					 	Even  among  the  elite  officer  corps  of  the  f irst  class  of  the  Military  Academy,
					 	the  main  stream  of  the  Korean  Army,   	the  linge?-ing  emotional  residue  of  the
					 	Korean  War  is  waning  and  a  gap  is  growing  between  the  young  and  the  old.
					 	The  generation   	gap  in  the  Korean  Army  is  said  to  be  greater~than  that  of  the
					 	old  Japanese  Imperial  Army  officers  and  the  graduates  of   	the  War  College  i~
					 	the  Self  Defense  Forces  of  Japan.
		   	-		    	The  foundation  of  Liberalization  are  Young  Officers  and  Businessmen
					 	The  old  generation  of  army  officers  include  the  graduates  up  to  the  lOth  class
					 	in  the  Military  Academy.    	The  llth  class  and  thereafter  received  the  formal
		  	,		    	4  years  of  tra ining  after  the  end  of  the  Korean  war.    	About  70  percent  of  them
					 	have  visited  the  U.S.   	for  training  and  learned  about  democratic  process  and
					 	civilian  control  of  the  military.    	They  are  "awaken~d  soldiers."
					 	"The  military   	tends  to  be  regarded  as  the  core  of  conservatism,  but  today  in
		  	-		    	Korea,   	those  who  know  democracy  by  heart  are  the  young  officers.    	They  went
					 	abroad  on  many  occasions~,   	familiar  with  foreign  customs  and  increasingly
					 	critical  ef  Pak's  rule."    	(Retired  General  Tsukamoto)    	Wiien  military  opinion
					 	is   	to  be  reflected  on  the  establishment  of  the  next  political  system,   	these
					 	young  officers'   	voice  cannot  be  ignored.											   	-
					 	On  the  other  hand,   	there  are  some  technocrats  in  the  economic  circles  who  are
		   	'		    	showing  a  considerably  strong  move  toward  non-Pak  system  of  control.    	One  of
					 	the  indications  is  the  demand  for  turning  government  controlled  banks  to
					 	private  control,   	as  it  became  noticeable  in  the  summer  of  this  year.    	The
					 	heads  of  five  large  central  city  bar~.ks  were  all  appointed  by  the  government
		   	-		    	and  the  share  holdings,of  the  bank  w~~r.e  denied.    	Therefore,   	for  all  practical
					 	purposes  the  banks  were.totally  under  government  control.
		  	-		    	Turning  banks   	to  private  control  was  first  advocated  by  Chong  Chu-yong,   	head
					 	of  the  Federation  of  Korean  Industries.    	In  July  at  the  economic  symposium
					 	held  under  the  auspices  of  the  press  club,   	he  openly  declared,   	"The  banks
					 	should  be  freed  from  government  control."

				 	Mr  Chong  was  regarded  as   	the  leader  in  the  economi~  field  ar~d  rather  cl.ose
	    	_		  	to  President  Pak;   	therefore,   	his  declaration  came  as  even  more  of  a  shock  to
				 	government  officials  concerned.
					When  Hasegawa  asked  Chong  about  his  intention,   	he  replied  adamantly,   	[South]		     	-
				 	Korea  is  now  proceeding  to  reorganize  its  econom~  suitable  to  the  international
					outlook.    	As  long  as  banks  remain  under  government  control,   	reorganizing  banks
				 	to  meet  international   	demand  or  competing  in  the  international  market  is  not
				 	possible.    	No  matter  what  people  say,   	I  will  never  abandon  my  stand."
					Behind  these  words,   	there  is  an  incident  of  Yulsan  Industry's  bankruptcy
				 	this  summer.    	The  four  ban~_  presidents  were  fired  and  one  of  them  was
					arrested  on  a  charge  of  irregular  lending  practices  to  business  firms.    	The
					banking  activities  plunged  into  chao~  as  a  result  of  the  shakeup  and  the
					bankers  were  painfully  made  aware  of  the  difficulty  in  working  under  rigid
					government  control.
					In  the  uproar,  President  Sin  Pyong-hyon  of  the  Bank  of  Korea,   	the  central
					government  bank,   	and  former  presidential  special  assistant,  expressed  his
					grave  concern,   	"The  economic  circles  seem  to  be  trying  to  make  a  breakthrough
					by  putting  banks  under  private  control  but  it  will  mean  serious  change  in
					the  overall  economic  structure.    	Therefore,   	the  change  cannot  be  accepted
					that  simply."
					There  are  many  at  trading  firms  who  do  complain  about  the  intervention  by  the
					Pak  government.    	At  each  trading  firm  there  is  an  official  from  the  Ministry
					of  Commerce  and  Industry  who  checks  up  on  the  performance  of  each  department
					of  the  firm  every  day.    	When  days  pass  without  a  sales  contract,  he  reprimands
					the  man  who  is  in  charge  for  being  "lax."    	A  complaint  such  as,   	"Why  don't
					these  government  officials  hold  their  tongue,"  is  increasing  among  the  workers
					at  trading  firms.
					Thanks  to  the  economic  progress  brought  about  by  the  Pak  government,   	in  Korea
					as  3  developing  country,   	the  number  of  technocrats  grew  annually,   	though  not		     	-
					as  much  as  in  Japan,  but  they  have  become  the  core  of  the  middle  class  of
					the  country.    	According  to   	the  statistics  released  from  the  tr~xation
					office,   	in  1976  excluding  military  personnel,   	there  are  61,000  people  who			    	-
					earned  monthly  income  of  200,000  to  400,000  won.    	Last  year,   	the  number
					increased  to  100,000,   	of  which  23,000  earned  more  than  500,000  won.    	The
					fact  is  despite  runaway  inflation,   	the  middle  income  group  has  grown.

					"Mr  Sin  Pyong-hyon,  president  of  the  Bank  of  Korea  is  a  typical  new  technocrat
			     	in  Korea.    	He  was   	transferred  from  the  Finance  Ministry  to  the  World  Bank
			     	and  worked  there  for  12  years,   	and  he  bacame  a  veteran  in  international

				     	According  to  Mr  Hasegawa,   	the  strongest  impression  he  had  fron~  his  Septemtaer
				     	visit  to  Korea  immediately  preceeding  the  presidential  assassination  was  that
				     	the  young  businessmen  were  beginning  to  speak  decisively  about  economic
				     	refo rm.    	Young  commissioned  officers  who  are  military  technocrats  and  young
				     	businessmen  form  the  basis  of  stability  and  are  unmistakably  th~  banner  holder
				     	of  democracy  and  the  liberalization  movement  of  Korea.
				     	Nevertheless,  an  element  of  uncertainty  and  the  source  of  instability  come
		 	.		    	from  North  Korea.    	Recently,  North  Korea  agreed  to  receive  the  American  table
				     	tennis   	team  in  Pyongyang,   	creating  a  mood  for  rapprochement  with  the  United
				     	States.    	Also  there  was  no   	indication  of  anit-South  maneuvers  such  as
				     	guerrilla  infiltration.
				     	Then  suddenly,   	there  came  the  political  disturbance  in  Pusan.    	The  Central
				     	Committee  of  the  Revolutionary  Party  for  Reunification  promptly  announced  an
				     	"Appeal  to  South  Korea"  and  Radio  Pyongyang  called  daily  f.or  the  downfall  of
				     	the  Pak  regime.    	The  Pyongyang  citizens  gathered  at  rallies  calling  for  the
				     	overthrow  of  the  Pak  regime.
				     	Therefore,   	the  assassination  of  Pak  would  have  perhaps  increased  the  broadcast
				     	but   	this  was  limited  to  a  comment  in  NODONG  SINMUN  on  the  29th,   	the  silence
		 	+		    	is  almost  strange.
				     	There  has  been  no  report  of  North  Korean  troop  movement.    	At  present,   	it		 	,
				     	seems  they  are  quietly  watching  the  development  within  South  Korea.
				     	Nonetheless,   	behind  the  scenes,   	the  move  toward  a  North-South  dialog  is
				     	quite  active,   	as  may  be  seen  in  the  mediatory  work  by  President  Ceausescu  of
				     	Romania.    	The  U.S.,   	China  and  USSR,   	the  three  powers,   	also  share  the  same
				     	view.
				     	"No rth  Korea`s  greatest  objective  was  to  bring  down   	the  Pak  regime  of  national
				     	presperity  and  defense.    	Each  time  there  was  political  instability  in  South
				     	Korea,   	North  Korea  has  had  bitter  experience  in  its  unsuccessful  attempts  to		   	-
				     	bring  about  internal  division  in  the  South.    	Probably  there  has  never  been
				     	an  incident  as  unexpected  as  the  one  occurr.ed  recently--the  act  of  self-destruc-
				     	tion  within  South  Korea.    	It  appears   	that  North  Korea  has  decided  to  watch  for
				     	a  while  and  wait  for  a  chance  to  Iaunch  a  peace  offensive."    	(Mr  Okai)
				     	"Still,   	the  pressure  from  the  Soviet  Union  and  China  is  great.    	Immediately
				     	following  the  incident,   	the  United  States  reportedly  asked  the  Soviet  Union
				    	and   	China  to  keep  North  Korea  under  control.    	China,   	in  particular,  must  have
				    	applied  all  available  resources  to  keep  North  Korea  in  line.    	If  both  coun-
				     	tries  threaten  Nortr  Korea  to  cut  off  oil  supply,   	this  alone  will  keep  North
				    	Korea  frozen."    	(Mr  Hasegawa)
				     	"At  present  the  situation  in  South  Korea  is  creating  a  more  advantageous
				    	position  for  North  Korea;   	therefore,   	North  Korea  could  be  waiting  for  an

				 	a  mild  tempered,   	able  official  and  an  excellent  administrator,  well  balanced
					and  informed  on  world  affairs.    	Under  President  Pak,  he  served  as  foreign
					minister  �rom  1967  to  1971  and  premier  from  March  1976  to  present.    	To  have
					servecl  for  4  consecutive  years  as  foreign  minister  under  the  Pak  administra-			 	-
				 	tion  which  was  characterized  by  frequent  changes  in  [cabinet]   	posts  is  extra-
					ordinary.    	He  was  able  to  stay  because  he  was  well  thought  of  as  an  able
					diplomat.    	Particularly  noteworthy  is  his  positive  approach  to  the  improved
					Japan-China  relationship.
					"He  surely  does  no;:  face  any  ogposition  from  the  military  establishment  and
					is  ~aell  accepted  by  the  journalists  and  financial  circles.    	The  military  does
					not  want  any  abrupt  change  at  this  moment  and  the  new  Constitution  will  have
			_			to  be  written  in  a  hurry.    	For  the  transitional  government  Choe  seems  to
					be  a  logical  choice."    	This  is  the  general  opinion.
					The  other  presidential  candidates  include  former  premiers  Chong  I1-Kwon,  Kim
					Chong-pil  ar~d  Paek  Tu-chin  or  former  Director  of  KCIA,  Yi  Hu-rak.    	But  Kim			    	~
					Chong-pil  and  Yi  Hu-rak  are  the  types  of  individuals  who  will  likely  draw
		 	-	     	fire  from  young  officers  wishing  to  get  rid  of  the  Pak  legacy.    	"Even  though
					they  are  seniors  in  the  military,   	they  are  no  better  than  the  mirror  image
					of  the  Pak  regime,"  was  the  response  of  the  colon2ls  from  the  llth  class
					and  members  of  later  classes  of  the  military  academy.
					The  unexpected  low  rating  is  given  to  Kim  Chong-pil  because  it  is  believed
					that  he  had  at  first  opposed  the  constitutional  amendment  for  a  third  term
		 	~	     	presidency,  but  after  he  became  premier  he  helped  create  the  Y usin  constitu-
					tion.    	Yi  Hu-rak  is  living  under  tne  shadow  of  Kim  Tae-chung  incident.    	Chong
					I1-kwon's  name  was  also  mentioned  once  as  a  possible  candidate  but  he  is
					g~nerally  regarded  as  a  politician  of  long  past  days,   	and  his  birth  place
					being  North  Korea  also  seems  to  be  a  minus  factor.

					  	The  Korean  workers,   	especially  the  young  women  at  the  lowest   	level  of  the		  	-
					  	social  structure,   	were  forced  to  suffer  numerous  pains  even  during  the

					  	the  present  ec~nomic  development  policy  based  on  foreign  cgpital  inducement
					  	with  top  priority  on  export,   	the  low  wage  of  workers  and  denial  of  workers'
					  	rights  are  considered  to  be  easential  in  implementing  the  policy.    	In
					  	1977  when  the   	10=billion  dollar  export  target  was  reached,   	Che  contradictory

			    	The  confidential  report  of  Japan  Trade  Promotion  Organization  (JETRO)
			    	forwarded  to  Tokyo  from  the  Seou~  office  in  June  made  it  clear  that  the
			    	financial  atructure  of  Korean  buaineases  auffered  general  regression
			    	as  a  reault  of  a  tight  money  policy  aince  1978  and   	from  the  drop  of
			    	export  bueineas  beginning  this  year.    	After  pointing  out  the  wave  of
			    	bankruptcy  aweepi.ng  across   	Che  country,   	it  went  on   	to  report  the  following:
			    	"Thua,   	the  trouble  in  the  industry  emerged  affecting  wide-ranging
			    	industries  including  large  busineas  concerns.    	Therefore,   	the  chain  reaction
			    	toward  bankruptcy  is  now  feared.    	We  must  watch  further  development  as   	the
     	~		    	tremor  from  the  ehock  is  expected  to  linger  on....
			    	The  worst  hit  is  the  textile  industry.    	The  major  textile  cartel,   	like
			    	Hanguk  Silk  group  mentioned  above,   	is  reported  to  have  run  up  againat
			    	the  wall  in  its  management.    	This  was  followed  by  the  troubles  of  inedium
			    	size  operations  experiencing  shut  down  and  outright  bankruptcy.    	According
			    	to  the   	'Report  by  Sewn  Goods  ~cport  Industries,'  37  firms  out  of  more
			    	than  200  members  of  the  Korea  GaYtnent  Exporters  Association  went  bankrupt,
			    	forcing  them  to  pull  out  of  the  export  market.    	At  any  rate,   	the  down  turn
			    	trend  of  the   	textile  industry  is  progressing  at  a  rate  faster  than
			    	expected.    	Furthermore,   	the  dark  outlook  in  the  future  may  drive  more
			    	businesses  to  closing  their  deors."
		_		   	The  Japaneae  Capitals  Are  Directly  Involved  With  Maintaining  Low  Wage  in
			    	Korea
			    	'i'he  same  report    	also  took  up  the  problem  of  the  electronic  induatry:
			    	exporta  hit  the  ceiling  in  this  area  when  the  second  energy  crisis  was
			    	brought  on  by  the  turmoil  in.Iran  and  the  cons~uner  goods  savings  movement
		_		    	undercut  the  demand  in  the  domestic  market.    	The  main  export  itema  of
			   	Korea  today  are  textiles  and  electronics.    	Electronics  are  expected  to
			    	replace  textile  goods  for  export  in  the  second  half  of  the  1980's.
			   	Electronics  and  machinery  are  two  major  fields  which  the  Japanese  are  heavily
			   	concentrating  on.
     	-		   	Therefore,   	the  worsening  management  problems  of  these  industries  which  may
			   	lead   	to  bankruptcy  or  close-down  point  to  the  possibility  of  direct
			   	confrontation  between  the  worke rs  and  the  Japanese   	firms  in  Korea  or
			   	local   	firms  with  Japanese  capitals,   	over  such  disputes  as  lay  offs  and
			   	non-payment  of  wages.    	The  recent  move  of  the  Japanese  bueinesses  at
			   	the  Masan  Export  Commodities  Processing  Zone  clearly  is  a  matter  of  concern.
			   	According  to  the  report  by  Jetro,   	the  Japanese-origin  firms  are  experiencing
			   	a  shortage  of  capital  funds,   	a  snag  in  exports  and   	labor  dispute  beginning
			   	January  to  tiie  end  of  May  1979.    	The  number  of  finns  affected  total

     	-				possibly  erupt  into  the  second  or  third  YH  Trading  type  incident  when
			     	fueled  by  unjustifiable  lay  offs  or  non-payment  of  wages.    	Next,   	it  must
			     	be  pointed  out  that  the  Japanese  capital  is  directly  involved  with
			     	maintaining  a  situation  of  low  wages  and  no  woricers'   	rights  in  Korea.
			     	Korea's   	leading  magazine,   	SIN  TONGA,   	carried  an  article  "The  Japanese
			     	busineas  in  Korea"  in  its  August  1976  edition.    	The  author  was  Song
			     	Hyong-mok,   	then  assistant  econamic  editor  at  CHOSON  ILBO.
		'				The  article  delving  into  thp  reality  of  Japanese  capital,  deeply
		,				penetrating  into  all  spheres   	of  the  Koxean  economy  from  children's  t~ys
		;				to  automobiles,  and  attempting  to  expose  problem  areas,   	touched  on  the
		�		     	mode  of  Japanese  operation:    	ho~~  pressure  was  applied  to  maintain  low
			     	wages  by  whatever  means  available  at  hand.    	It  stated:    	"It:  Seoul,   	there
			     	is   	the  so-called   	'J.V.  Aseociation'   	organized  by  the  Japanese  i.nvestora  in
		'				Korea.    	The  Japanese  executives  sent  by  home  offices   	to  auch  large  Korean
		~				firme  as  Sun  Kyong  Synthetic  Fiber,  Korea  Yakult  Dairy  and  Cheil  Synthetics,
		~															.
			     	form  the  officers  of  the  Association.    	The  Association  seems  on  the  surface		  	=
			     	no  more  than  a  simple  friendahip  society  but  actually  it  is  an  organization
		;		     	of  s ane  significance."
		!		     	The  members  hold  regular  meetings.    	They  exchange  information.    	At  times,
	 	'		     	they  discu.ss  common  problems  and  matters  of  mutual  concern.    	Occasionally,
	 	'		     	the  Association  members  present  to  the  Korean  Government  through  the
			     	Japanese  embassy  in  Korea  the  common  concensus  of  opinions  related  to
	 	j		     	their  common  interests.    	The  infoYtnation  they  exchange  at  the  meeting
			     	includes  matters  di.rectly  affecting   	the  interests  of  the  Korean  people.			  	v
	 	;		     	For  instance,   	the  wage  for  Korean  workers  is  a  case  in  point.    	What  ?evel
	 	~		     	of  wage  is   	fair  to  them  is  not  in  thP  discussion.    	In  the  country  where
			     	the  starvation  level  wage  of  6,~0('-7,000  won  a  month  still  exists,  the
	 	~		    	wage  level  of  Japan,   	the  economic  giant,  would  never  become  a  matter  of
			     	comparison  or  even  be  taken  into  consideration.
	 	!
			     	The  basic  concerna   	of  these  people   	lie  in  the  area  of  how  best  to  keep
    	_			 	the  wage  at  ttie  lowest  possible  level  and  how  to  keep  its  plant  running
     	~			 	aC  the  low~st  cost.    	They  exchange  information  on  the  wage  difference			    	-
			     	between  one  business  e~~tablishment  a.3  another,   	an  industrial  zone  and
					the  other.    	At  times,   	they  draw  up  a  chart  to  show  the  difference  of  wage
			     	from  one  geographical  area  to  the  other:    	Hong  Rong,  Taiwan,   	or  Malaysia
			     	where  the  Japanese  businesses  are  active.    	If  their  firms  were  set  for
			     	higher  wages  than  the  other  area  or  industrial  zone,   	they  immediately  lodge
			     	a  protest.    	At  times,   	they  apply  pr~2sure,   	though  politely,   	to  Rorean

				    	The  Korean  Labor  System  Flows  Bank  Into  Japan
				    	The  Korean  workers  are  denied  the  rights  as  a  group  to  negotiate  or  take			   	-
				    	group  action,   	as  a  result  of  trie  Provisional  Decree  for  Labor  Union  and
				    	Labor  Dispute  Control  in  the  Foreign  Investment  Enterprise  among  others,
				    	designed  to  induce  foreign  capital  investment  like  the  one  from  3apan,
				    	decreed  on  1  January  1970;   	the  Iack  of  protection  forces  the  workers
				     	to  take  low  wages.    	Their  suffering  could  be  said  to  have  worsened  by  the
				    	Japanese  capital  investments  in  Korea.
				    	This  mode  of  operation  by  Japanese  business  in  Korea  affects  not  only
				    	Korean  workers.    	Similar  impact  is  felt  on  the  workers  in  Japan.    	The
				    	Japanese  capitalists  attracted  to  Korea  because  of  iCS   	low  wages  and
				    	no  rights  provision  are  attempting  to  impose  the  same   	labor  conditions
				    	on  the  workers  in  Japan,   	to  maximize  the  merit  of  such  demand.    	Buttressed.
				    	by  the  experience  with   	the  Korean  labor  system  of  low  wages  and  no
				    	workers'   	rights,   	they  promote  to  underi;ut  Japanese  labor  conditions.    	The
				    	move  toward  so-called  rationalizing  the  labor  is  a  case  in  point.
				    	Let's  take  an  example  of  Taiho  Sangyo.    	Taiho  Sangyo  started  at  the
				    	Osaka-Maioka  area  in  March  1960  with  2-million  yen  capital  fund  as  a  maker
				    	of  nuts  and  bolts.    	In  the  spring  of  1972,   	12  years  later,   	it  grew  to  the
				    	size  of  8.5  million-yen  capital  firm  with  more  than  160  employees.    	However,
				    	in  April  1972  the  labor  union  was  organized  by  140  young  workers  who  joined
				    	the  Osaka  Branch  of  the  Metal  Workers  Union  under  Sohyo,   	the  General
				    	Federation  of  Labor  Unions.    	It  was   	the  turning  point  for  Taiho  management
				    	which,   	thereafter,  assumed  a  stand  of  labor  management  to  be  the  top
				    	priority  matter  of  importance.    	When  Taiho  Sangyo  entered  Korea  at  the
				    	Masan  Export  Commodities  Processing  Zone  in  April  1974,   	establishing
				    	"Korea  Taiho"  with  1  million  dollars,   	it  was  undertaken  as  a  part  of
				    	carrying  out  the  basic  posture  stated  above.
				    	Since  Korea  Taiho  went  into  operation,   	the  standard  products  were  regularly
			'		    	shipped  to  Japan,  dubbed  on  the  label  of  Japan  Taiho  and  re-exporCed  to
				    	overseas.    	As  a  result,   	Taiho  in  Japan  had  to  cut  back  on  production  and
				    	proceeded  to  lay  off  workers.    	Furthermore,  when  the  products  by  Korea
				    	Taiho  were  all  shipped  to  the  U.S.,   	Taiho  in  Japan  was  found  entirely

					  	useless  which  ultimately  led  to  the  ann~uncement  of  closing  the  head
					  	office  of  Taiho  Japan  and  dismissal  of  everyone  there  in  November  1977.
					 	For  management,   	as   	long  as  Korea  Taiho  yields  profit,   	they  could  not
					  	care  less  about  scrapping  Japan  Taiho.    	Moreover,   	they  were  successful
					  	in  ~heir  uriion  busting  undertaking.
					 	The  workers  at  the  home  office  in  Japan  suffered  worsening  working
					 	conditions  and  progressive   	layoff s   	in  proportion  to  the  increased  role			 	~
					  	of  Korea  Taiho,   	ultimately  leading  to  a  total  close  dewn  and  layoff a			    	_
					 	en  mass.    	Today,   	250  labor  union  members  are  demanding  the  reopening
					  	~~L  Japan  Taiho.
					 	The  Korea  Taiho  was  subsequently  sold  out  to  Korea  Kori,  another  Japanese
					 	affiliated   	firm  in  Korea,   	in  connection  with  a  suspected  graft-taking  scandel,
					  	throwing  the  initial  ambition  of  Taiho  management  down  the  drain.    	Never-
					 	theless,   	the  point  is  made  to  show  the  typical  example  of  a  Japanese  firm
					 	using  the  Korean  labor  market  to  shake  off  labor  problems  at  home.
					 	Gessei  i{asei  Demands  Rationale  to  Labor
					 	A  similar  situation  could  be  found  in  cases  of  steel  drawing  industry,
					 	Sugimoto  llrawing,  Nippon  Nails  and  Nippon  Seisen,   	located  also  at   	the			    	~
					 	Osaka-Maioka  area.    	The  Sugimoto  Drawing  specializing  in  the  various
					 	sma11  size  steel  wires  established  Korea-Sugimoto  Drawing  with  2.65  million
					 	dollars  in  October  1974,   	achieved  524,000  dollars  export  within  half  the
					 	quarter  of  a  year,   	abruptly  closed  down  the  head  office  in  Japan  in  the
					 	beginning  of  1975  and  layed  off  all  250  employees.    	At  present,   	95  workers
					 	are  demanding  the  reopening  of  the  shops.
					 	In  the  case  of  Nippon  Nails,   	the  Korea-Nippon  Nails  was  established  with
	     	_			  	1.87  million  dollars,  went  into  operation  in  June  1974  and,   	soon  enough,
					 	announced  the  partial  close-down  of  the  home  office.    	The  original  employees
					 	numbering  about  600  were  now  trimmed  down  to  little  more  than  100.    	The
	     	-			 	Nippon  Seisen  specializing  in  coils  invested   	1.68  million  dollars   	to
					 	establish  Korea  Nippon  Seisen.    	Since  April  1973  when  it  went  into  pzoduction,
					 	the  home  office  began  shrinking,   	reducing  200  employees  by  two-thirds.
					 	The  above  firms  all  went  to  the  Masan  Export  Commodities  Processing  Zone.
					 	Among  them,   	for  example  Taiho    	Industry  was  said  to  be  once   	looked  upon
					 	with  the  expectation  that  the  merit  from  the  activity  in  Korea  might  be			 	'
					 	funneled  back  to  the  Japanese  workers  in  the  form  of  added  benefits.    	But
					 	in  reality,   	it  was  nothing  but  wishful  thinking  or  fantasy.    	The  way

						One  may  deduct  from  the  above  that  the  cases  in  reference  were   	limited
						only  to  medium  size  firms  and  to   	the  past  several  years.    	Nothing  is				     	-
						further  from  the  truth.    	Let's  take  an  example  of  Gessei  Kasei.    	A  large
						firm  making  rubber  Footwear,   	the  Geasei  Kasei  has  3ts  main  office  in
						Kurume  city.    	The  firm,  havin~  800  million  yen  in  c~;pitat  asset~,  had  4,600
						employees  at  th~  four  plant  sites  including  the  one  att  the  main  office
						area.    	The  Gessei  Kasei  established  the  joint  venture  firm  S~nhung  Chemical
		   	-		  	at  Masan  Export  Commodities  Processing  Zone  with  1.3  million  dollars				    	-
					 	investment  and  1,100  employees,   	beginning  its  operation  from  April  1974.
					 	Its  yearly  sale  reached  the  5  million  dollar  mark  a  year.
						Many  products  at  Sinhung  chemical  were  exported  to  Gessei  Ka.sei  in  Japan
					 	and  re-exported  overseas  under  Gessei  Kasei  labels.    	Thanks  to  the  low
						wages  of  Korean  workers,   	the  shipment  turned  out  to  be  about  30  percent
					 	cheaper  than  the  same  material  made  in  Japan  even  after  import  duty  payment
					 	and  the  difference  was  put  into  the  pocket  of  Gessei  management  as  net
					 	profit.    	The  Gessei  Kasei  maintains  another  joint  venture  firm  in  Taiwan.
					 	The  imported  finished  products  from  the  joint  venture  firms  constitute
					 	20  percent  of  all  Gessei  labeled  footwear.    	The  firm  naturally  looks  for
					 	all  available  means  to  widen  the  rate  of  imported  goods.
					 	It  was  under  this  background  that  the   	Gessei  Kasei  presented  its   	labor
					 	union  a  very  severe  "rationalization  measure"  in  the  name  of  breaking
					 	through  the  slump  in  business  as  well  as  rebuilding  company  management:
					 	the  Mii  plant  at  Fukuoka  prefecture  and  the  Ujiya  plant  at  Tochigi
					 	prefecture  be  closed,   	1,000  employees  be  laid  off  and  all  remaining
					 	employees'  wages  be  cut  by  10  percent.    	It  occurred  when  the  rapid  growth
		    	-		   	of  the  Korean  economy  was  rumored  to  be  giving  a  hr~rd  push  to  Japan  and
					 	the  fooCwear  industry  was  believed   	to  be  included  in  the  hard-pressed
					 	industries  of  Japan.
					 	The  labor  union  attempted  resistance  as  best  it  could  but  in  the  face
					 	of  strong  and  crafty  offense  of  the  management,   	the  union  did  not  have
					 	much  choice  buC  to  accept  in  the  end  in  June  1978  approximately  what
					 	th~  management  had  been  demanding  on  the  grounds  that  the  Korean  operation
					 	was  a  fait  accompli.
					 	The  Offenders  Are  at  the  Same  Time  Victims
					 	The  above  report  is  primarily  transcribed  from  the  "Point  of  Origin--My
					 	Report"  by  Akira  Inugari  carried  in  the  July  and  August  1978  editions				  	-

					 	As  a  result,   	the  following  points  can  possibly  be  brought  out  in  conclusion.

					 	taining  and  strengthening  low  wages,  no  rights  Korean  labor  system,   	created
					 	in  the  name  of  Japan-Korea  economic  cooperation,   	is  facing  a  challenge  from

					    	Second,   	the  worsening  condition  of  the  workers   	in  Japan  is  being  acce~erated

							nomic  growth  has  slowed  down,  with  the  real  rate  of  growth  for  September
							to  December  falling  to  8.9  percent.		(Last  year  the  growth  rate  for  the				_

							Compared  to  the  prosperity,   	the  disease  of  inflation  continues  to  be  strong.
							In  July,   	prices  of  petroleum  related  products,  beginning  with  gasoline,
							were  raised  by  59  percent.    	The  cost  of  electricity  went  up  35  percent.
							Last  year,   	the  bus  fare  went  up  from  60  won  (30  Japanese  yen)   	to  70  won,

							Age  of  Crazy  Pricea
							According  to  the  Bank  of  Korea,  Korea's  central  bank,   	the  January  to  Sep-
		     	�			 	tember  rate  of  consumer  price  increase  was  23  percent,   	compared  to  last
		     	_				year's  17.5  percent;  and  the  rate  of  wholesale  price  increase  was  the  same
		     	_			 	23  percent  for  January  to  September  of  this  year.    	Many  people  say  that
							the  official  price  index  is  not  reliable.    	One  Japanese  businessman  resi-
							dent  of  Seoul  comments  about  rising  prices,   	"I  feel  it  is  really  about  30
							percent,"    	while  a  Korean  salaryman  insists,   	"No,   	it's  more  than  50  percent."
							Talk  among  real  estate  companies  in  the  suburbs  of  Seoul  is  that  there  is
							a  strong  outluok  for  sales  of  land  with  the  expectation  of  rising  prices.
							"Land  prices  are  double  those  of  last  year.    	Just  this  morning  three  sales
							were  completed,"  said  a  young  presid~nt  of  real  estate  company  who  seemed
							unable  to  stop  beaming.    	Korea  now  is  in  a  condition     	that  resembles  that
							of  "crazy  prices"  in  Japan  immediately  after  the  first  oil  crisis.
							Inflation  can  destroy  the  foundations  of  Korean  society.    	Already  exports,
							the  mainstary  of  the  Korean  economy,   	are  falling  due  to  inflation.    	Ex-
							ports,   	in  terms  of  volume  grew,  an  an  average  of  20  percent  during  the
							last  10  years  and  showed  remarkable  increases  until  1978.    	But  this  year,
							although  exports  in  terms  of  money  are  expected  to  reach  15.5  billion  dol-
							lars,   	greatly  exceeding  last  year's  12.5  billion  dollar  nark,   	the  volume
							of  exports  has  remained  flat.    	Because  of  increases  in  the  cost  of  raw
							materials  and  labor,  Korean  commodities  are  rapidly  lo~sing  their  compet-

					The  Costs  of  Emphasizing  Big  Business;   	Failure  To  Nurture  Medium  and  Small
					The  Korean  economy  is,   	in  a  word  unbalanced.    	Along  with  continuously
					growing  heavy  and  chemical  industries  such  as  automobiles,   	shipbuilding,
					and  petrochemicals  which  are  under  the  wing  of  a  small  number  of  financial
					cliques,   	there  exists  a  great  number  of  premodern,  medium  and  small  enter-
					prises.    	Among  workers  there  are  extreme  differences  in  wages  and  in  bonuses
					among  workers  in  large  industry  and  in  medium  and  small  industries,  among
					white  collar  university  graduates  and  blue  collar  middle  and  high  school
					graduates--the  dif.ferences  that  are  almost  unthinkable  in  Japan.

					  	Government  Funds  to  Big  Business
					  	According  to  Cha:trman  Kim,  rates  of  claim  against  the  quality  of  Korean
					  	manufactured  goods  from  abroad  is  very  high.    	The  reason,   	it  is  satd,   	is
					  	that  there  are  few  medium  and  small  induatries  that  can  produce  higt~  qual-
					  	ity  goods.    	Consequently,   	if  large  industries  are  to  compete  on  the  inter-		 	_
					  	national  market  fram  the  standpoint  of  quality,  machine  parts  must  be
					  	imported  from  places  abroad  such  as  Japan.    	And  this  has,   	in  addition,
					  	worsened  Korea's  bad  international  balance  of  payments  situation.    	Chair-
					  	man  Kim  tells,   	"It  is  essential  to  modernize  the  medium  and  smal.l  indus-
					  	tries  in  order  to  make  further  progress  in  the  Korean  econou~y.    	Medium  and
					  	small  entrepreneurs  are  themselves  not  sitting  by  idly."
					  	The  Korean  Government  has  clearly  ign~red  Korea's medium aid  small  industries,
					  	which  encompass  70  percent  of  all  workers.    	For  example,   	there  is  the  area
					  	of  finance.    	Because  of  capital  scarcity,  as  in  other  developing  countries,
					  	the  relative  importance  of  government  capital  in  Korea  is  very  high.    	Dut		   	_
					  	the  stream  of  government  investments  is  directed  mainly  to  large  industries.
					  	More  than  90  percent  of  capital  from  the  national  investment  foundations,
					  	corresponding  to  Japan's   	treasury  investments  and  loans,   	goes  to  a  mere  4
					  	percent  of  large  industries.    	Almost  100  percent  of  capital  from  the
					  	government-related  Long  Term  C-edit  Bank  and  Korean  Industrial  Bank,   	goes
					  	to  big  business.    	Eighty  percent  of  all  new  capital  loans  are  made  to
					  	heavy  and  chemical  industries.
					  	Conspicious  Capital  Differences
					  	Medium  and  small  industries  with  inferior  capital  and  technology  have  low		   	=
					  	rates  of  profits  and  slower  growth  in  sales  receipts,   	than  large  indus-				-
					  	tries.    	Consequently,  wages  of  employees  in  this  sector  must  be  relatively
					  	lower.    	According  to  investig3tions  of  the~Cen.tral  Committee  of  the  Korean
					  	Federation  of  Small  Business,   	if  the  wage  level  of  large  industry   	(in-
					  	dustries  with  over  300  employees)   	is  100,   	the  wage  standard  for  medium
					  	and  small  inc~ustries  is  60.    	With  Korea  experiencing    	inflation  for  the
					  	past  several  years,  while  wages  have  risen  more  than  30  percent  yearly
					  	(spring  1979  wage  increases  were  35  percent),  when  bonuses  and  fringe
					  	benefits  are  included,   	the  wage  differences  between  large  industry  and
					  	smaller  to  medium  industries  are  growing  steadily  wider.
					  	In  the  case  of  Korea,   	there  are  vast  differences  in  wages  based    	upon
					  	educational  background.    	For  example,   	in  the  case  of  the  Kumsong  Communi-
					  	cations  Company  (a  maker  of  electronic  communications  parts),  a  subsidiary
					  	of  Lucky  Group  which  is  one  of  the  three  big  "Zaibatsu"   	[business  cliques],
					  	the  beginning  salary  of  male  high  school  graduates  is  70,000  won  (35,000
					 	Japanese  yen)   	per  month,   	and  for  male  college  graduates  it  is  200,000  won
					 	a  month.    	A  manager  in  a  Japanese  affiliated  business  testifies  that,
					  	"Korea's  wage  differences  are  enormous;   	such  that  section  chie�s  with
					 	college  education  receive  as  much  as  400,000  won  a  month  while  the  average

	    	,		   	vacement  is  even  greater  in  Korea  than  in  Japan.
				 	Difficulty  in  Steering  the  Economy
				 	The  existence  of  a  handful  of  high  paid  workers  and  vast  strata  of  lowly
	   	-		   	paid  workers--the  Korean  economy  that  lacks  a  middle  class,   	inevitably  has
				 	as  its  Achilles  heel  the  narrow  international  market.    	Moreover,   	the  busi-			 	-
				 	ness  base  of  the  large  heavy  and  chemical  industries  which  the  government
				 	has  frantically  tried  to  build  up,   	is  becoming  economically  and  socially
					weak.    	From  this  year,  business  stagnation  in  such  well-kna~i  large  enter-
				 	prises  as  Hyundae  and  Associates,   	Taeh~n  Electronics,  and  Korean  Textiles			   	-
					has  come  to  the  surface.    	But  in  the  background,   	the  government-led  eco-
					nomic  policy,  which  promoted  heavy  and  chemical  industry  by  depending  sole-
				 	ly  upon  exports,   	has  come  to  a  standstill.
					Now  in  the  Korean  Goverrnnent  and  financial  circles  there  are  repeated  cries
				 	for  reconsideration  of  the  policy  of  nurturing  big  business  by  over-empha-
					sizing  the  development  of  heavy  and  chemical  industries.    	With  the  passing
				 	time  since  the  president's  death,   	these  voices are  becoming  stronger.    	"Ths
	    	-		   	Korean  Government  has  by  no  means  neglected  medium  and  small  industries
					until  now.    	Nonetheless,   	from  now  on,  and  more  than  before,   	efforts  w~.ll
					probably  be  made  to  strengthen  support  in  the  areas  of  finance,   	technology
					and  management.    	Overlapping  investments  in  heavy  and  chemical  induatry
					are  blatant  and  thus  investment  read~ustment  is  necessary,"  emphasized
					Kim  Son-kil,   	assistant  minister  of  Light  Induatry  of  the  Ministry  of
					Commerce  and  Industry  which  corresponds  to  Japan's  Ministry  of  Interna-
					tional  Trade  and  Industry.
				 	In  addition,   	Kim  Ki-hwan,  an  officer  of  the  Economic  Planning  Board,  ex-
					plains,   	"When  the  president  was  alive,   	the  slogan  of  economic  construction
					was,   	'enter  the  ranks  of  advanced  nations  with  heavy  and  chemical  indus-
				 	trialization.'    	Now  it  is  changing  to   	'enter  the  ranks  of  advanced  nations			 	~
					by  stabilizing  the  livelihood  of  the  people."'
					The  Korean  economy  has  already  accelerated  in  the  direction  of  oligopolic			  	~

				   	[5  Dec  79  p  7]
				  	Aiming  foi"an  Open  System;  Yet  Rapid  Reform  Is  Dangerous
		=			 	Ruined  Big  Business
				  	Seven  months  ago  an  incident  occurred  which  frightened  Korean  business-
		-			 	men.    	One  of  the  new  big  business  cliques,  Yulsan,   	collapsed.    	Yulsan  was
				  	a  young  business,   	founded  in  1975  by  a  youthful,   	30  year-nld  entrepreneur,
				  	Sin  Son-ho.    	The  company  achieved  rapid  growth  in  aggressive  foreign  trade,
				  	focusing  on  the  oil  dollar  rich  Middle  East,   	and  expanded  to  include  Yulsan
				  	Construction,  Yulsan  Marine  Transport,  Yulsan  Aluminum,  and  Yulsan  Shoes,		    	_
				  	among  other  enterprises.    	In  an  instant,   	Yulsan  entered  the  ranks  of
				  	important  companies.
				  	A  year  ago,   	this  company  fell  into  a  business  slump  15ecau~e  its  policies
				  	of  positive  expansion  had  gone  too  far.    	At  first  the  government  was  ready
	 	_			  	to  provide  assistance  for  reconstruction  of  the  company;  bankruptcy  of
				  	this  big  enterprise  would  not  only  cause  shocks  among  related  businesses
				  	at  home  but,  because  this  was  a  tcading  company,   	there  would  be  repercus-
				  	sions  abroad  as  well.
				  	Upon  investigating  the  accounting  practices  of  the  fir~,  however,   	the
				  	gover~ent  changed  its  mind.    	In  Korea,  where  exports  are  the  national  po-		  	-
				  	licy  and  foundation  of  the  state,   	finan~ing  for  purposes  of  export  ia  of-
				  	fered  at  a  favorable  9  percent  to  trading  companies;  and  it  was  discovered
				  	that  Yulsan  Enterpriaes  had  misused  these  funds,  borrowing  ostensibly  for
		_			 	export  but  using  these  funds  for  speculation  in  real  estate,   	etc.    	Yu];san
				  	Enterprises  went  quickly  bankrupt.    	The  president,   	Sin  Son-ho  was  arrested
				  	and  jailed.    	Not  only  this.    	In  Seoul,  which  has  only  five  banks,   	the
				  	managers  of  four  banks  which  had  loaned  money  to  Yulsan--Bank  of  Seoul   	and
				  	Trust  Co,  Korea  First  Bank,   	the  Hanil  Bank  and  the  Korea  Development  Bank--
				  	were  dismissed  from  their  positions.
				  	This  incident  impressed  everyone  with  the  strong  might  of  the  Korean  Govern-
		_			 	ment  which  holds  the  power  of  life  or  death  over  the  financial  world;   	of
		_			 	course,  behind  this  was  the  dictatorial  power  of  President  Pak  who  reigned
				  	for  18  years  with  tremendous  authority.
				  	After  the  Death of  the  President
		_			  	It  has  been  more  than  a  month  since  the  death of  the  president.    	High  level
				  	bureaucrats  in  the  Economic  Planning  Board,   	Finance  Ministry,  and  Commerce
				  	and  Industry  Ministry  are  surprisingly  calm.    	Although  they  have  lost
		-			 	powerful  backing,   	strangely  they  appeat  to  be  full  of  confidence.
				  	"The  president  was  a  great  man.    	However,   	the  longer  he  was  in  power  the		     	,
				 	more  apparent  his  deficiencies  became.    	In  a  sense,   	these  became  obstacles
				  	to  the  implementation  of  rational  economic  policies,"  cri.ticized  one
				 	high  official  who  spoke  frankly  on  condition  that  his  name  not  be  disclosed.			-

			    	For  example,  even  though  it  was  essential  to  construct  dwellings  in  citiea
			    	where  the  population  was  concentrated  more  than  sufficient  money  was
			    	poured  into  housing  improvements  in  farm  villages,   	because  this  was  favored
			    	by  the  president.    	He  also  made  the  unreasonable  demand  that  the  three  goals
			    	of  increasing  economic  growth  rates,   	increasing  exports,  and  stabilizing
			    	prices  be  pureued  at  the  same  time.    	For  the  sake  of  promoting  econem~`c
			    	growth  above  all  ~.lse,   	econ~mic  management  was   	focuaed  around  heavy  and
			    	chemical  industries,  and  there  was  no  balance  between  supply  and  demand
			    	on  essential  products  and  foodstuffs  sought  b,y  the  people,  and  the  result
			    	was  rising  prices.    	Now  that  the  president  is  dead,   	there  is  a  possibility			 	-
			    	for  a  rise  of  more  ideal  economic  management.
			    	Korea's  economy  is  tiow  in  the  midst  of  implementing  a"price  stabilization
			    	policy"  which  gives  primacy  to  price  controls.    	The  aim  is  to  create,   	using
			    	the  mechanism  of  the  market,   	a  competitive  economic  structure.    	The  main
			    	pillar  of  this  is  financial  reform.    	The  state  of  Korea's  financial  mar-
			    	ket  resembles  that  of  Japan  during  the  first  decadel:  after  1945.    	It  is  to-
			    	tally  under  control  of  the  government  and  tHe Bank  of  Korea.    	Because  there
			    	are  a  lot  of  preferential  money  rates  centering  around  export  capital,
			    	there  can  be  no  movement  iii  official  rates.    	Interest  on  loans  and  on  sav-
			    	ings  in  Seoul's  banks  is  practically  unchanging.    	Because  no  monetary  policy
			    	exists  in  Korea,  credit  squeezes  are  carried  out  mainly  through  "window-
			    	guidance."  Because  interest  on  savings  is  held  comparatively  low  in  the
			    	midst  of  severe  inflation,   	there  are  few  people  saving  at  Seoul's  banks.			    	~
			    	Money  flows  into  high-interest  loan  markets   	(with  36  to  48  percent  annual
			    	interest)  of  the  so-called  private  security  markets.    	In  order  to  normalize
			    	this  distorted  financial  market,   	the  government  and  the  Bank  of  Korea  are
	  	,		   	trying  to  begin  liberalizing  money  rates.
			    	The  Importance  of  Ingenuity
			    	Ku  Pon-ho,  vice  president  of  Korea's  think  tank,  Korea  Development  Re-
	  	-		  	search  Institute,   	tells,   	"Jnti1  now  Korea  has  advanced  with  a  Japanese
			    	type  of  economic  development.    	But  from  now,  we  aim  at  the  West  German				 	-
			    	model  of  an  open  economic  system."    	The  now  large  scale  Korean  economy
			    	has  already  had  too  much  direct  government  control.    	It  must  allow  for
	  	-		  	autonomons  civilian  entrepreneural  acti~rity,  and  it  is  essential  to  have
			    	civilian  inputs  of  creative  ingenuity  for  the  production  of  high~r  quality
			    	goods.
			    	Opening  the  domestic  economy  to  international  activity  naturally  goes
			    	along  with  political  and  cultural  liberalization.    	It  will  do  no  good  to
			    	internationalize  the  economy  on  the  one  hand,  and  maintain  a  closed
			    	society  on  the  other.    	Vice  President  Ku  Declares,   	"The  conclusion  of
			    	these  past  years'  serious  thoughts  is  that  we  h~ve  reached  the  stage  where
			    	the  key  to  development  of  the  Korean  economy  is  individual  freedcui,   	cre-
			    	ative  ability,  and  technological  reform.    	The  limits    	of  a  closed  economy
			    	can  be  seen  in  the  example  of  the  Soviet  Union."

						Nonetheless,  many  contradictions  in  Korea,  sucli  ae  political  oppression
						and  expanding  differences  in  income  can  result  in  increased  social  unreat
		~			    	with  rapid  liberalization.
						Can  Korea,  having  many  U.S.  educated  Korean  technocrats  and  pragmatiats
						successfully  pursue  a  stable  economy  in  the  way  these  technocrats  want
						it?    	In  order  to  side  with  the  optimistic  views  of  the  technocrats,   	it  is
						not  doubt  essential  to  look  a  little  more  closely  at  conditions  in  poli-
					 	tical  circles,  and  in  the  military  that  actually  controls  Korea,  and  at
						the  activitiea  of  students  who  have  explosive  power.
