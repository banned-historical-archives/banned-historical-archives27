 OF THE COMMUNIST TROOPS IN PEKING
 34.  When the Chinese Communists were laying siege to Peking late
 in 1948, a young Chinese named Chu Fan-chi (this is not his true name),
 a native of South China, was studying social sciences at Tsing Fins,  -
 University.                       This was his freshman year, and he did part-time work to
 supplement the government scholarship which paid his tuition.  Students
 with political interests were divided between the San Min Chu I group
 of pro-Kuomintang sympathies and the New Democracy group of the Com-
 munists, whose members were mainly underground.  Chu belonged to the
 Communist group.  "I was not," he says, "a Communist Party member,
 but I was an ardent Communist supporter, because I didnat like the
 Kuomintang regime and thought there had to be a change.  I had no
 actual Party beliefs,"  He served the Communists by reporting Nation-
 alist troop movements to a Communist classmate who had a link with
 the underground.  Communist troops entered Peking on 6 January., and
 University classes stopped.  The Communist students had orders not
 to reveal their identity immediately, but they gradually emerged to
 contest power with the San Min Chu I students, who were beginning to
 go underground.  In the struggle that followed the Communists tried to
 break up the Nationalist group by persuasion, and when this failed
 some fights broke out,  Chu and his associates tried to get the Nation-
 alists arrested and sent to the Communist Army,  The San Min Chu I
 group did not survive very long.
 4.  Meanwhile Chu was anxious "to help the people," and he found
 agreeable work among the Communist students in distributing American
 surplus food and medicine to the poor around Peking, who had suffered
 during the siege.  But Communist officials who had just arrived said
 that this work must stop.  Protests from Chugs relief group that the
 poor were suffering had no effect.  The officials insisted that all
 medicines must be returned and no further distributions made of food
 or other supplies,  "If the sick want to get better," they said, "they
 can do so by joining the Red Army." Chu and his friends tried to-
 continue their relief work,, but their pleas with sick farmers to join
 the army for treatment met with no success.  The peasants had no desire
 to abandon their families, and one of them said, "If the government
 wants us to join the army to get cured, we would rather not be cured,"
 Chu also did a stint in the Peoples Self-Defense Corps, whose members
 guarded the factories or places of business where they worked.
 EDUCATION UNDER THE COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT
 5.  Officials of Tsing Hua University at first adopted a concilia-
 tory attitude towards the different student groups, but this tolerance
 could not last,  Within a few days the Communist youth., assisted by
 Communist faculty members, were in actual control of the University,
 For two months there were no classes, and Chu joined the holiday throngs

 welcoming the Communist Army, listening to speeches, and singing Com-
 munist Party songs.                     There was much praise for the 'Elder Brother,"
 as Stalin or Russia was called.  Chu got a chance to make a speech..
 over a loudspeaker. He shared the revolutionary enthusiasm which the
 well-disciplined Communist troops brought with them.  The students
 returned to the University to find that the regular curriculum had_,
 disappeared along with all but 600 of the 2,500 students.  Students,
 professors, and servants were assembled in a "Mobilization Meeting
 for Learning the New Democracy," and here a member of the Communist
 . Committee for the University told them :  "Mao's principles are the
 only ones that can bring about China's reconstruction.  If you don't
 agree with Mao, you don't want China to become strong, and that means
 you are a personal-doctrine man (individualist)."  Chu was able to
 make several remarks on the need for a strong China.  But when the
 students were asked, after a long harangue, if they wanted to study
 the principles of the New Democracy and Mao Tse-tung's ideas, about
 a third said they did not, for they were technical students, engineers
 and the like, who had no desire to exchange their subject for politics.
 Nevertheless the reluctant minority was argued into silence.  The
 chairman of the meeting was a member of the Communist Central Committee,
 North China Department, who had been appointed to look after political
 work in the University.
 6.  Classes were abolished, and to study the all-embracing subject
 of Communism the students were divided into groups of 23 with typical
 cellular organization:  each group had a leader, an assistant leader,
 a cultureemusements chief, and a chief of education and propaganda.
 The groups, which included professors, students, and servants, were
 subdivided into sections of seven or eight students.  Leaders of the
 various groups and sections were chosen by balloting on a single list
 of hand-picked candidates.  This Communist-type organization operated
 under the Central Committee of the University.  The period of holiday
 and celebration was over, and Chu sensed a cooling off among the
 students who had enthusiastically welcomed the Communists.  There were
 no opposing votes, but numerous abstentions.  One of the first actions
 of the group leaders was to examine their lists for persons with pro-
 Kuomintang sympathies, since these students would require special
 attention.
 7.. The group studies were completely orthodox in their Marxist-
 Leninist-Stalinist bias.  Subjects included the history of society,
 the rise of capitalism, the theory of labor and revolution, with evil
 examples drawn from the U.S. and good from the U.S.S.R.  The "correct"
 approach or interpretation filtered down from a Communist lecturer
 through the groups to the sections, where discussion took place.  Chu
 was disappointed, like many other students, when he learned that
 "discussion" was a period in which students were encouraged to reveal
 their "incorrect" opinions for the benefit of the odd person, a silent
 observer, always present with notebook in hand.  Otherwise real dif-
 ference of opinion was not tolerated, and "dangerous" questions or
 views might leave a personal mark difficult to erase.
 8.  Chugs academic career was profoundly affected by some innocent
 well-meant remarks he made while trying to find out what foreign

 intervention in China signified.  During a discussion of American occu-
 pation of Tsingtao, he posted in the "wall newspaper" some questions
 about Russian occupation;  why Russia, a peaceful country, dismantled
 Manchurian factories and took the machinery away after World War II;
 why it kept garrisons in Port Arthur and Dairen now that the war was
 over; why the Russians controlled the Manchurian railways.  What was
 the difference,, he asked, between American occupation of ?singtao and
 Russian occupation of Dairen and Port Arthur?  He soon learned that
 he had set the cat among the pigeons.  Students showed great interest
 in these questions, and they were obviously not satisfied with the
 official answer that Russia was merely protecting the Chinese people
 from the Nationalists and from American aggression.  The issue did
 not die at once, and the Central Committee member responsible for the
 University called Chu on the carpet for a personal talk.  "Was it
 right to ask this question?" he asked.  "Did you think about the
 consequences?  How long has this idea been in your head?  The effect,"
 he added, "is to destroy the fruits of the revolution.  This idea
 must have been in your head as a result of Kuomintang poison."'  He
 gave some helpful advice and suggested that Chu start a diary of his
 thoughts.  He also took notes industriously while Chu, upon his
 request, talked about his childhood, the evolution of his ideas, and
 other personal matters.  Thereafter he had Chu's section leader bring
 the diary in every few days for inspection, and Chu was required to
 turn over letters from his family, who fortunately wrote only of
 family affairs,  "I believe," Chu says, "that about 400 of the 600
 students in our university agreed with me.  I feel sure that only a
 few agreed with the Communist Party's explanations on Manchuria.
 9.  Nearly all the students disliked the deadly routine and long
 hours of the new program, twelve hours a day for six days a week.
 When they complained to the authorities they were reminded that the
 Peoplefs Liberation Army suffered greater hardships.  Only Party
 members tackled the grueling routine without complaint, but they
 numbered hardly more than 25.  The students complained in three
 different petitions only to be told that they had been "fed with capi-
 talist ideas and enjoyed life," with the usual remarks on the heroic
 Red troops.  Though normal studies were resumed during the morning,
 the doctrinnaire discussions continued for the rest of the day.
 10.  Chu continued his studies until the end of the summer.  Then
 he and about 30 others received the disturbing news that they were
 being transferred immediately to a revolutionary university run by the
 Communist Party.  When they made inquiries, they were told that they
 were regarded as "unreformable" in a non-party university such as
 Tsing  Hua, which was run by the government.  Therefore they were being
 transferred to the North China People's Revolutionary University.

 EDUCATION UNDER THE CONMIST PARTY
 11.  The People's Revolutionary University, only a few miles from
 Tsing Hua, was a former. military training center under the Japanese
 occupation, with parade ground, barracks, and facilities for 10,000
 troops.  During.Chu's stay there were almost 9,000 students, roughly
 19 to 25-years of:age, of whom one fifth were girls living in separate
 barracks?  "Bourgeois ideas of enjoyment" were discouraged.  The stu-
 dents ate two scanty meals a day, lived in crowded barracks, and slept
 on the floor.  There was considerable sickness and little medical
 attention.  The Party insisted upon a Spartan routine under rigid
 Communist control.  The University was under the North China Depart-
 ment of the Communist Party, and its Principal was a member of the
 Central Committee, a fat, stalwart type, six feet tall, who had fought
 as a guerrilla against the Japanese..  One overall Study Department was
 responsible to the Principal for information on the students' "thoughts."
 The faculty (about a fourth were women) was divided into four functional
 departments:  The first included students from other universities in
 need of "ideological reform"; the second trained intelligence personnel
 for the People's Liberation Army; the third was for members of liberal
 groups; and the fourth took care of Party members who stood accused
 of bungling their jobs or doing poor work.
 12.  The large classes were subdivided into groups of 23, where
 discussion was carried on.  The twenty-fourth member was the instruc-
 tor, whom the students referred to as "comrade" or "able Party member";
 he was a Party member who did little teaching, but listened to the
 discussion, took notes, and settled disputed points.  The procedure was
 for a Communist professor to give a lecture to the classes once a. week;
 then the students broke up into groups for a week-long discussion.  In
 this way there could be little straying from the Party line.  If you
 did not join in the discussion, you were asked why you had no opinion,
 and the leader might accuse you of being "a lagging-behind particle",
 "without responsibility for the People's Revolution."' Therefore all
 the students talked,but most of them, Chu believes, were as miserable
 and disappointed as he was.  The theme was always political, and the
 Cominform newspaper published in Bucharest was a standard text.  There
 were also labor duties such as farming plots, rebuilding walls, and
 repairing roads:  this was called "reform by labor."
 13.  About 200 students were invited to witness "land reform" in a
 near-by village, and they did not forget the experience.  A People's
 Court was trying the wife of a landlord who had escaped before the.
 "liberation."  Only about 20 of 250 farmers present stood up when the
 "able Party member" conducting the court asked those to do so "who had
 suffered most from her oppression."  Before the trial was over the lone
 woman had been stripped naked and killed by the excited mob.  Most of
 the farmers and even more of the women had quietly left before the
 final scene, which the students had to watch, sitting on the ground,
 "tense, silent except for intermittent sobs among our girls." Before

 leaving the village Chu saw a child crying over the woman's body.  The
 trial was reviewed the following morning in a group discussion "with
 the coldness of a laboratory experiment."  The "able Party member" who
 had led the court was criticized for "tailism" (or staying one step
 behind the mob), and the girl students who had wept were upbraided for
 "warm feeljngism" and "not knowing your friends from your enemies."
 The whole epitsode made a deep impression, and many students sickened
 by the memory of what they had seen tried to avoid assignment to farm
 relief work.  The Communists felt safer in sending them to Mongolia,
 since the Chinese regard Mongols as a different race.
 14. Personal friendships were dangerous, and few developed.
 Students who were Party members adopted the role of keeping their status
 secret for two months, while they were gathering information on the
 others.  Chu was avoided because of his notoriety for raising the Dairen
 and.Port Arthur issue months earlier.
 15. The "brain washing" technique in its most stringent form
 began under the guise of "idea training."  The leaders would present
 a discussion topic such as "Idea Formation and Class Property," of
 which the students must make a complete analysis and report their own
 ideas.  They were free to say anything they liked.  In this way the
 University undertook an exhaustive inquiry into the views and atti-
 tudes of the whole student body.  This began with a report from the
 students on their families, how they and their families lived, their
 education, their personal relationships, and the kind of life they
 preferred.  After much checking the University announced that half the
 students, roughly 4,000, had "deep-set contradictions" in their lives.
 To discard their "evil past" the students must "confess"; they must
 "reveal their contradictory past to the public,"  Without confession
 of one's "bad past" there was no hope of becoming a "new man."  Ample
 time was allowed the students during this inquisition.  The intensity
 of the struggle "of new thoughts against old," Chu says, "can hardly be
 exaggerated."  It went on incessantly.  Men and women alike would break
 and weep under the constant probing of their "thoughts." If anyone
 spent a sleepless night brooding over his problems, some "friendly"
 person (actually a "thought seduction worker") would ask with an appear-
 ance of sympathy:  "If you don't feel like revealing it in public, tell
 it to me."  Students got their old reports back with instructions to
 re-write them to show the results of the "self-criticism" program.
 Several students saw no way out except to take their own lives, but
 to fail in the attempt was serious.  One who failed was transferred to
 a college where "self-criticism" was even more strenuous:  two-thirds
 of the time spent in labor, one-third in study.
 16.  There was always the danger, if you could not confess something,
 of being sent to the People's New Life Labor School, which was designed
 for "idea training":  a minimum of six months of hard labor and hard
 study, and the course might be extended.  Students recognized such
 Sanitized - Approved For Release6!CIA-RDP78-00915R000200050002-2
 Sanitized - Ap127                          9'6R000200050002-2
 schools as forced labor camps, and they were horrified at the thought
 of being sent to them, though that was the fate of 17 of Chu's classmates.
 17.  Married students were kept under pressure to divorce their
 mates, since Party work must separate them anyhow. Some women students
 were already mothers of "sons of the people."  Only after about two
 months was any sexual freedom permitted:  earlier the men and women
 had been kept apart.  By the time Chu graduated about 17 girls were
 pregnant, but University officials refused permission for them to marry
 merely to satisfy a "feudal idea."  Likewise sons were asked to out off
 relations with their parents if the parents belonged to "the exploiting
 class."  This was the iron test.
 18. Chu refused to agree to abandon his parents for the Revolu-
 tion.  He was afraid they would starve.  He continued to refuse after
 repeated requests.  Finally the University sent someone to South China
 to see if they were as poor is he had described them.  Meanwhile there
 was nothing he could do but promise further consideration and delay
 deciding the issue, postponing his decision to renounce his father and
 become "a son of the people" until graduation.
 19.  "This experience," Chu says, "completed my disappointment in
 Communism.  I realized fully now that a Communist cares only for the
 Party's interests, and I understood now that the Revolution had been
 fought only for the profit of a particular political Party."  The
 knowledge that his family was under police investigation "shook and
 shocked me."  He decided to escape.
 FINAL EIS AND GRADUATION
 20.  The "democratic examination" comprised an appearance before a
 committee of "positive elements of the student body and faculty."  Chu
 himself was a member of a dozen such committees.  There were no grades
 as such. The Students were graded only on their revolutionary relia-
 bility, and all decisions of committees must be unanimous.  Then they
 were graduated, kept over, or sent to another "idea reform" institution.
 Chu barely, squeezed through.  He was regarded as "a backward element,"
 "stubborn," and "not steady" in his political attitude and grasp of
 revolutionary principles (because he had overstressed his "personal
 situation" in refusing to out off his parents).  But his "positive
 attitude towards the working classes" got him through.
 21.  Armed with his graduation certificate, Chu was ordered to a
 distant province for duty; but he went instead to South China, assured
 himself that his parents were safe, and within a few weeks found refuge
 in Hong Kong,
