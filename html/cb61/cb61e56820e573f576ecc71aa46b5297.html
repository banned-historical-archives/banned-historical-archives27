 CUBA AND THE TEST BAN TREATY
 Cuba has failed thus far
 to signify any intention of
 signing the limited nuclear
 test ban treaty, apparently
 wishing to avoid commitment on
 a sore issue in the Sino-Soviet
 dispute.   Cuban diplomatic of-
 ficers abroad have been instruct-
 ed to avoid offense to either
 the Soviets or the Chinese, and
 Fidel Castro has admitted that
 the problem posed by the Sino-
 Soviet dispute is under high-
 level review in his regime.
 There is apparently another
 reason for Havana's silence on
 the treaty.    Official Cuban
 statements of the past several
 weeks have hinted at a growing
 realization that any trend to-
 ward improved US-Soviet rela-
 Chartered Cubana Airlines
 flights between Cuba and Brazil
 have become a major means of
 transporting non-Cuban Latin
 Americans to and from Cuba.
 The five such flights since
 late July have carried nearly
 400 non-Cubans.
 The first of the recent
 series--on 25 July--brought 71
 Latin American passengers to
 Havana for the 26 July celebra-
 tions.   The other four flights
 --on 15, 22, 28, and 29 August
 --transported over 200 Latin
 Americans to Brazil from Havana.
 Some of the aircraft involved
 returned to Cuba with smaller
 numbers of passengers.   Many of
 the 200 Latin American passen-
 tions would not automatically
 mean any alteration in US policy
 toward the Castro regime. Cas-
 tro therefore may see the test
 ban treaty as the first of a
 series of developments toward
 a US-Soviet detente that might
 ultimately weaken Soviet support
 of his regime against US pres-
 sures.
 The US Embassy in Moscow
 noted on 30 August that Castro's
 long-delayed reply to Khrushchev's
 message of congratulations on
 Cuba's 26 July holiday was
 couched in militant terms lack-
 ing in the Soviet message. Cas-
 tro stressed the importance of
 the world-wide "anti-imperialist"
 struggle, whereas Khrushchev
 had focused on Cuba's internal
 "progress.'!
 gers had been delegates to the
 26 July ceremonies, but others
 had apparently been in Cuba for
 longer periods and some had
 probably received training there.
 Of the passengers of these four
 flights to Brazil, 75 were na-
 tives of Caribbean area coun-
 tries.   Their circuitous travel
 through Brazil was evidently
 designed to help conceal the
 fact that they had been in Cuba.
 Additional Cuban aircraft--
 as well as a Soviet passenger
 ship--are to leave Brazil for
 Cuba later in the month with
 delegates to the seventh congress
 of the International Union of
 Architects, which opens in Havana
 on 29 September.

 SECRET          The Communist World
 During his stay in Yugo-
 slavia from 20 August to 3
 September, Khrushchev labored
 hard and probably successfully
 to convince Belgrade of his sin-
 cerity in pursuing closer rela-
 tions and of the mutual bene-
 fits to be derived.   He covered
 five of Yugoslavia's six re-
 publics, and talked with vir-
 tually every leader of national
 stature.   He had numerous pri-
 vate talks with Tito, and gave
 three major public addresses.
 The visit  has probably carried
 Yugoslav-Soviet relations to a
 level not equaled since the
 1955-56 rapprochement period.
 Khrushchev comported him-
 self as an earthy man-of-the-
 people and the world's foremost
 champion of peace.    Moreover,
 he was not above attempting to
 rekindle memories of Russia as
 the protector of Europe's Slavs..
 Everywhere he went, he found
 something Yugoslav to admire--
 from the dome of an exhibition
 hall at Belgrade's fairground
 to factory workers' councils at
 Rakovica--and broadly hinted
 the USSR could learn much from
 Yugoslavia.
 Although Moscow did not
 report Khrushchev's praise of
 workers' councils--once cited
 by the bloc as prime evidence
 of Tito's heresy--the Yugoslavs
 have made much of the remark,
 apparently hoping to represent
 it as a narrowing of doctrinal
 differences.   The Chinese and
 Albanians are already using
 Khrushchev's statement and
 other aspects of the visit for
 polemical purposes.
 Tito, with one eye on his
 relations with the West and the
 nonaligned states, carefully
 avoided saying anything during
 the visit which would imply he
 had compromised his country's
 independence.  At the same time,
 he has obviously been pleased,
 and he generously praised Khru-
 shchev as a leader and the USSR
 as "the first country of social-
 ism."
 Tito implied on 30 August
 that he and Khrushchev had re-
 vived their 1956 agreement
 which,in declaring their Com-
 munist parties equals,had marked
 the zenith of their previous
 rapprochement.   "Cooperation
 in certain economic fields has
 been agreed on and will be ex-
 panded," according to Tito.
 This will constitute "compensa-
 tion for what has been omitted
 in the past."  Scientific and
 cultural relations are also to
 be improved.
 Both leaders reiterated
 that they were agreed on the
 more important international is-
 sues, such as peaceful coexist-
 ence and extending assistance
 to the developing countries.
 For the most part Khru-
 shchev's speeches suggested he
 did not press Tito for any com-
 mitments.   He did, however, make
 a strong bid for increased Yugo-
 slav participation in the bloc's
 division-of-labor schemes--i.e.,
 presumably Yugoslav membership
 in the bloc's international
 economic organization.(CEMA).
 Unidentified sources of the
 Western press claim Yugoslavia's
 long-standing request for only
 observer status in CEMA was ap-
 proved in principle shortly

 Expulsion of two more
 Chinese--one an embassy func-
 tionary--from Czechoslovakia on
 2 September for political ac-
 tivity is the latest development
 in the widening rift between
 Peiping and the Soviet-oriented
 bloc.
 The S.ino-Soviet quarrel has
 reached a new pitch of intensity
 in the exchange of verbal blows.
 The main thrust of Mao Tse-tung's
 statement on 29 August about the
 situation in South Vietnam was
 against the Soviet Union.   Al-
 though the Chinese leader ap-
 parently felt that open personal
 attacks were beneath his dignity,
 it seems clear that Mao's sneers
 were directed at Khrushchev.
 On 1 September the Chinese
 fired back in reply to the So-
 viet attack of 21 August with ar
 official blast projecting an
 image of white-faced fury.   Al-
 though Peiping charges the USSR
 with treachery in failing to sup-
 port Communist China on a broad
 range of national objectives,
 Chinese anger is still centered
 on the issue of nuclear weapons.
 The scathing language and cal-
 culated insults employed by the
 Chinese leave little more which
 can be said.
 Peiping's calculated vio-
 lence suggests the Chinese may
 be attempting to goad the Russians
 closer to a formal break in dip-
 lomatic relations.   Moscow, how-
 ever, is unlikely to accommodate
 them by making the first move.
 Although the two powers can be
 expected to show their antago-
 nism more and more clearly, the
 trappings of protocol will be
 maintained for the immediate
 future.

 The Diem government is re-
 storing a facade of political
 unity and an appearance of or-
 der in South Vietnam following
 the crackdown on the Buddhists
 two weeks ago.   Saigon and other
 urban centers are outwardly
 calm, and conditions have re-
 turned to near normal.
 The regime continues to
 publicize statements of support
 from various government-manip-
 ulated groups.   Progovernment
 rallies have also been staged
 in larger towns throughout the
 country, including Saigon,
 largely by civil servants and
 government-sponsored organiza-
 tions such as the Republican
 Youth and Women's Solidarity
 movements.
 At the same time,  the gov-
 ernment is moving rapidly to re-
 lax martial law restrictions,
 reopen schools, and return some
 functions from military to ci-
 vilian control.   It has announced
 the release of almost all Bud-
 dhists and students arrested
 since the state-of-emergency
 declaration and has permitted
 Buddhist pagodas to reopen un-
 der new leaders, who have voiced
 their confidence in and grati-
 tude for the government's con-
 ciliatory policy and for the
 satisfaction of their demands.
 6 Sept 63
 Although there is still no
 indication when martial law may
 be lifted, troops are less con-
 spicuous.   The Saigon commander,
 General Dinh, has publicly de-
 nied any serious dissidence within
 the army. The government ap-
 pears in fact to be maintain-
 ing disciplined loyalty from
 most ranking officers and unit
 commanders, although one entire
 Civil Guard company reportedly
 has deserted as a result of the
 crisis.
 While there has been a drop
 in the total of government forces
 fully committed to counterinsur-
 gency operations and some dis-
 ruption has occurred in rural
 rehabilitation projects, mili-
 tary pressure on the Viet Cong
 is being maintained and most ci-
 vilian agencies charged with di-
 rection of provincial programs
 are functioning normally.   The
 crisis still has had no discern-
 ible effect on the pattern of
 Viet Cong activity.   A slight
 increase in attacks during the
 past two weeks appears to be a
 normal step-up which occurs pe-
 riodically.   The absence of in-
 tensive Viet Cong military ex-
 ploitation of the crisis may re-
 fleet a wariness of actions
 which might strengthen the gov-
 ernment's hand.

 Laotian Premier Souvanna
 Phouma is scheduled to leave
 Vientiane on 10 September on a
 trip.which will take him to
 Paris, Washington, and the
 United Nations.   While the pri-
 mary purpose of the trip appears
 to be to obtain medical treat-
 ment in France, Souvanna has
 indicated that he wants to dis-
 cuss recent developments in
 Laos with Presidents De Gaulle
 and Kennedy.   In New York, he
 will head the Laotian delegation
 at the opening of the General
 Assembly.   Souvanna expects to
 return to Laos before the end
 of October.
 In an effort to restore
 a semblance of stability to
 his tripartite government, Sou-
 vanna is again trying to smooth
 the way for the Pathet Lao to
 resume an active role in the
 coalition.   He has had several
 meetings with Phoumi Vongvichit,
 Patbet Lao minister of infor-
 mation, who arrived in Vien-
 tiane last week with the terms
 on which Pathet Lao leader
 Prince Souphannouvong would
 return to the capital.
 Following these meetings
 with Vongvichit, Souvanna told
 Ambassador Unger that he be-
 lieves the Pathet Lao are "com-
 ing around" and will be pre-
 pared to cooperate much more
 than in the past.   Souvanna
 revealed that be had agreed to
 the formation of a tripartite
 police force in Vientiane, one
 of the conditions Souphannouvong
 had set for his return.   Sou-'
 vanna hopes that General Phoumi,
 the rightist leader, will show
 "good faith" and support the
 creation of the new police
 force.
 Phoumi may agree to some
 token arrangement to satisfy
 Souphannouvong's conditions,
 but he is not likely to allow
 any such arrangement to under-
 mine his control over the
 capital.
 Meanwhile military activ-
 ity remains at a low level.
 Meo and neutralist forces have
 continued harassing actions
 along Route 7 near Ban Ban

 referendum on 8 September.  The
 electorate soon will be called
 upon to endorse Ben Bella--prob-
 ably without opposition--as the
 country's first president.
 Ben Bella's opponents, most
 of whom are erstwhile supporters,
 are campaigning hard for nega-
 tive votes in the referendum.
 They may succeed in some areas
 of traditional dissidence--such
 as the Orleansville area, the
 Kabylie, and the Constantine
 region--but even here Ben Bella's
 popularity is still strong.
 The draft constitution es-
 tablished a single political
 organization,  the National Lib-
 eration Front (FLN), as the
 source of power.  With Ben Bella
 as its head,  the FLN executive
 will continue its attempts to
 forge a national organization
 encompassing all facets of Al-
 gerian life.  Particular atten-
 tion is being given the army.
 Efforts during the past
 year to unify the body politic
 and develop a reliable cadre
 have not been notably success-
 ful, however.   Recently the
 FLN's student organization won
 the first round in its efforts
 to establish itself as an in-
 dependent organization by
 electing a predominantly pro-
 Communist executive.  This suc-
 cess has spurred the illegal
 Algerian Communist Party again
 to seek recognition as a sep-
 arate entity within the FLN.
 The draft constitution terms
 Algeria a socialist state, and de-
 tractors of Ben Bella claim  he
 will eventually align openl,, with
 Moscow.   However, the Algerian am-
 bassador to Washington--one of Ben
 Bella's closest supporters--has
 expressed confidence that after
 he has been elected and has reor-
 ganized his government, the premier
 will seek closer ties with the
 West.
 Ben Bella, a pragmatic rather
 than a doctrinaire socialist,
 meanwhile continues to consoli-
 date his position with the sup-
 port principally of Col. Boumed-
 ienne, defense minister and army
 commander.  Boumedienne's forces
 may be called on to suppress some
 outbreaks of violence during the
 next few weeks  s Ben Bella's op-
 ponents seek to arouse national
 feeling against him.  This alli-
 ance may not last over a longer
 term,  however.

 Premier Adoula, as required
 by law, has called the turbulent
 Congolese Parliament back into
 session at Leopoldville, and a
 new tug of war between the govern-
 ment and the parliamentarians
 seems in prospect.  Hoping to
 restrict the activities of the
 deputies and senators, Adoula has
 designated  the Parliament a
 constituent assembly to complete
 the long-discussed but still
 unborn Congo constitution.  Par-
 liamentary leaders are already
 protesting Adoula's move; they
 insist that they will do busi-
 ness as usual.   The parlia-
 mentarians  have their eyes on
 the 1964 elections, and there is
 likely to be even more maneuvering
 around and against the govern-
 ment than usual.
 The danger of antigovern-
 ment demonstrations developing
 out of labor troubles in Leopold-
 ville has abated.  Leaders of
 the government employees union
 dropped some of their more extreme
 demands, and the government,
 disturbed by the role labor
 played in the recent upheaval
 across the  Congo River in Braz-
 zaville, agreed to negotiate a
 new civil service statute.  Union
 leaders continue to warn that
 serious difficulties will occur
 if the government does not act
 to reform the currency, to curb
 inflation, and to narrow the
 gap between high living standards
 of ministers and those of the
 workers.   Army patrols meanwhile
 are being maintained throughout
 the capital.
 Adoula has formally asked
 UN Secretary General Thant to
 retain 3,000 UN troops in the
 Congo until mid-1964.  Thant
 says he will present Adoula's
 request in his forthcoming re-
 port to the Security Council,
 but he has told US officials
 that, without strong African
 support and improvement in the
 UN's critical financial situation,
 he was not optimistic.  Lagging
 financial contributions, Thant
 said, might force the UN to
 close its civilian technical
 operations  as well.

 and Congolese troops on 28
 August began a "mop-up" of
 ex-Katangan gendarmes who have

 The cabinet crisis precipi-
 tated on 30 August by the resig-
 nation of the three trade union
 representatives from Prime
 Minister Karjalainen's Agrarian-
 led coalition foreshadows a
 period of political maneuvering
 in Finland.
 The economic issue which
 toppled the government was a
 disagreement over a proposed
 agricultural price increase.
 The government planned to
 raise food prices, while the
 labor representatives demanded
 subsidies in order to maintain
 current consumer prices.   The
 three labor members, who repre-
 sented the leftist-dominated
 Confederation of Trade Unions
 (SAK), recently have tended to
 regard cabinet participation
 as a liability in the face of
 increasing criticism of wage
 policies by the Social Demo-
 cratic Party and its allied
 Finnish Trade Union Federation
 (SAJ).   Withdrawal of its rep-
 resentatives                          from  the cabinet
 leaves the SAK free to advocate
 its own views on wage policy
 more aggressively.
 Alternatives to the present
 cabinet, which remains in a
 caretaker capacity, are few.
 President Kekkonen's Agrarian,
 Party has long refused to ac-
 cept Social Democrats in any
 coalition, arguing that their
 inclusion would bring Soviet
 pressures on Finland.   Strong
 objections by a majority of
 Parliament have prevented inclu-
 sion of Communists in a coalition
 since 1948.   The Agrarians main-
 tain that a majority government
 is necessary to demonstrate wide
 support for their official policy
 of friendship toward the USSR.
 The four political parties
 in the Karjalainen coalition
 represent a parliamentary ma-
 jority, but the Agrarians in-
 sisted when the cabinet was
 formed in 1962 that the three
 trade union members also be
 included in the cabinet to pro-
 vide labor representation and a
 counterbalance to the Conservative
 right.

 It is likely therefore
 that Karjalainen will try to re-
 constitute the four-party coali-
 tion cabinet and again seek to
 include individuals from outside
 Parliament who would represent
 labor.   Should the fragmented
 Finnish trade union movement fail
 to provide such representatives,
 however, the Agrarians would
 probably resort to re-forming
 a majority government of the
 present four parties to share
 the burden of unpopular economic
 decisions to be made.   The re-
 maining alternatives would be a
 minority government or a non-
 political "government of ex-
 perts."

 well informed on current in-
 ternational problems, whose

 the number-two post in the
 Foreign Ministry.  He succeeds
 extreme leftist Evandro Lins e

 The US Embassy, however,
 believes that Foreign Minister
 Castro's appointment may be
 only temporary.  Goulart may
 seek political advantage by re-
 placing Castro in the near

 his own Brazilian Labor Party

 apparently feel entitled to
 the post.
