 ever, the Soviet leaders give no indication of in-
 creased military and economic support.

 While the current extensive reshuffling of key
 French government personnel appears to be primarily
 an effort by the Mendes-France regime to entrench
 itself, it has resulted in the transfer of many pro-
 American officials to relatively unimportant posts.
 There is also evidence that the government has fol-
 lowed a soft policy toward Communists.   Current
 disclosures of Communist infiltration, however, will
 probably force Mendes-France to come to grips with
 the problem of Communist influence in the government.

 THE SOVIET WORLD
 The Soviet Union's initial comment on the London agree-
 ments described them as an "attempt to bring back EDC under
 another name," criticized British and French leaders for ig-
 noring the wishes of their people on the German rearmament
 question, and depreciated the "sensational concessions by
 Britain" committing troops and a tactical air force to the
 Continent.   For the benefit of German listeners, Moscow in-
 sisted that the London agreements are incompatible with German
 reunification.
 As the Western Allies worked out their London agreement
 on West German rearmament, the USSR rapidly developed its
 campaign to frustrate Western community defense plans.   Mos-
 cow's immediate aim seems to be to generate French public
 and parliamentary pressure to defer ratification of the Lon-
 don agreement pending further four-power talks.   The Soviet
 leaders so far have chosen to offer as bait ostensible modifi-
 cations of their earlier terms for world disarmament and an
 Austrian treaty.
 Vyshinsky's UN disarmament proposal on 30 September was
 intended to appear as a substantial concession, with France
 as the principal target,   Molotov gave a copy to the French
 ambassador the day before Vyshinsky's speech, and remarked
 that "account must be taken of the German problem,"
 Moscow?s motivation in introducing the apparent con-
 cessions in its disarmament plan was also revealed by the
 French Communist press treatment of the subject.   Communist
 dailies in Paris developed the theme that it is no longer
 essential to remilitarize Germany since with the Soviet dis-
 armament concessions general disarmament will now be possible.
 The Soviet press carried extensive reports on the French re-
 action to Vyshinsky's proposal and attempted to create the
 impression that the French non-Communist press believed the
 proposal to be a step forward,  caking the rearming of West
 Germany unnecessary.
 Moscow is keeping any new proposals on Germany in re-
 serve, although past propaganda hints have suggested that
 specious concessions on the principle of free all-German
 elections may be forthcoming.   The routine character of Mos-
 cow's initial comment on the London conference suggests that
 the Soviet leaders are still studying the situation created

 by the London agreements and may withhold any major counter-
 initiative until the moment of greatest impact on the French
 assembly's debate on ratification.
 Moscow   apparently is counting on strong opposition in
 the assembly to forestall early implementation-of the London
 decisions.   The Soviet press hinted at assembly rejection by
 quoting a French Communist paper to the effect that "it is
 one thing to draw up plans, but another thing to bring them
 to realization and to obtain the approval of public opinion."
 During the London conference, the Paris Communist daily
 L'Humanitd hopefully predicted that "popular action" would
 render any decisions of principle reached at London a "dead,:
 letter, as the EDC is a dead better."
 Meanwhile, Moscow is strongly hinting through propaganda
 and its officials in Austria that it is ready to accept treaty
 limitations on the size and locations of its forces to remain
 there after the conclusion of a treaty.   This small concession
 is well calculated to encourage the eagerness of Austrian lead-
 ers for a resumption of treaty discussions.   The most recent
 Soviet propaganda on this new line flatly states, for the first
 time, that Austrian participation in the USSR's proposed Euro-
 pean security pact would result in the withdrawal of all Soviet
 occupation forces.
 Soviet efforts to normalize relations with Yugoslavia
 moved one small step forward with the conclusion of trade
 talks on 1 October 0   Representatives of Soviet foreign trade
 organizations and the Yugoslav Chamber of Foreign Trade signed
 in Belgrade an "arrangement" providing for about $2,500,000 in
 trade each way.   Twelve commodities are to be exchanged, the
 bulk of them by the end of this year..
 A Yugoslav government official subsequently disclosed to
 the American embassy that the USSR had proposed further trade
 talks on a government rather than a state enterprise level.
 He said that the USSR indicated during the recently concluded
 trade talks a desire to develop extensive trade with the Yugo-
 slavs.   It is doubtful, however, that such trade would include
 any significant quantities of wheat, which Yugoslavia needs.
 Increased domestic and Satellite demands are likely to preclude
 the export of Soviet wheat in substantial quantities.

 VIET MINH ARMY UNDERGOING EXTENSIVE REORGANIZATION
 AND INCREASING ITS FIRE POWER
 The Viet Minh army is undergoing an extensive reorganization
 made possible by continuing illegal arms shipments from Communist
 China.
 Following the Geneva truce agreement of 22 July, the Commu-
 nists embarked on an accelerated program of reorganization and
 training designed to develop a more modern army, one of greater
 fire power and capable of large-scale operations
 The reorganization is being accomplished largely through a
 reclassification of personnel already under arms.  Militia
 forces are being converted to regional and regular.status, new
 battalions are being formed from regional companies, and inde-
 pendent battalions and regiments are regrouping to form new
 divisions.  Although there has as yet been no significant
 numerical increase, some increment of the over-all strength is
 to be expected with the incorporation into the armed forces of
 Viet Minh war prisoners freed by the French and some Vietnamese
 army deserters and prisoners still held in northern. Vietnam.
 Without the continued flow of arms shipments from Communist
 China--in direct violation of the Geneva agreement, which pro-
 hibits the introduction of additional war materiel except on a
 replacement basis--a reorganization of this scope would not be
 .possible.. Since the cease-fire,  this aid has resulted in a
 50-percent increase in Viet Minh artillery weapons and has
 included enough mortars and recoilless rifles to equip five
 infantry Gdivis,ions   Ammunition, shipments have also been, heavy.
 The'American army attache in Saigon has pointed to the
 possibility that the Viet Minh hopes,  through a significant
 strengthening of its armed forces' capabilities, to influence
 the vote in'the.elections scheduled for July 1956 in all of
 Vietnam.   However,  if the elections are canceled, or if the
 Communists lose them, the Viet Minh would still be in a
 f avorable,,position for a rapid military conquest of the
 entire country.

 NEHRU'S FORTHCOMING VISIT TO PEIPING
 Indian prime minister Nehru's visit to Communist China in
 mid-October is unlikely to result in any formal agreement other
 than a joint communique reiterating the desire of the two coun-     25X1
 tries to live peacefully side by side.
 The publicity given by Nehru and Chou to the five princi-
 ples of nonintervention and coexistence in the preamble of the
 Sino-Indian treaty on Tibet strongly suggests that Nehru con-
 siders this an adequate declaration of the peaceful intentions
 of both countries.   His coolness toward another Colombo powers
 meeting and a conference of African and Asian powers supports the
 belief that he feels the principles have been; sufficiently dis-
 cussed.   His apparent difficulty in evolving satisfactory work-
 ing details for carrying out the principles is possibly one of
 the strongest factors militating against the idea that a new
 pact may come out of Peiping.   An opening of diplomatic rela-
 tions between China and Nepal., which may be announced after
 Nehru's return, could not be considered a result of the visit
 since India reportedly has already expressed itself in favor.
 In addition, Nehru may feel that another bilateral or
 multilateral nonaggression or Locarno-type treaty with China
 could be interpreted as a leftward shift in India's orienta-
 tion--an interpretation'he would take pains to avoid.   India
 now has no political commitments to Western nations other than
 those in the Commonwealth, and a pact with China would unbal-
 ance this situation.   Nehru's sensitiveness on the question of
 neutrality was illustrated as recently as late September by
 his unwillingness to have China invited to the conference of
 African and Asian nations proposed by Indonesia
 Nehru's uneasiness over China's real intentions in Asia
 is illustrated by the fact that in June both he and the Bur-
 mese prime minister indicated to Chou their fears of Chinese
 aggression.   4;hou is said to have reassured them.   In addi-
 tion, Chou supposedly promised to look into the question of
 dual nationality of Chinese residents in Burma and Indonesia.

 China has not acted as yet, however, and Chinese activi-
 ties and propaganda aimed at Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Thai-
 land have not been calculated to eliminate fear.   In early Sep-
 tember, Nehru expressed perturbation over the Chinese Communist
 shelling of Quemoy Island.   Nehru is unlikely to enter into an
 agreement with China until he can satisfy himself as to China's
 intentions, especially if he is beginning to fear China's mili-
 tary might, since this. might preclude his later seeking assist-
 ance from the West.
 While Nehru publicly deplores the Manila pact, there is
 no sign he willLmake it a major issue either domestically or
 internationally or that he'will seek a treaty with China to
 counteract it.   Indonesian piemier Ali Sastroamidjojo's fail-
 ure when he was in New Delhi from 22 to 25 September to gene-
 rate enthusiasm for a Locarno-type pact or even for a confer-
 ence of Colombo or Afro-Asian powers is indicative of Nehru's
 unwillingness to be pushed at this time.
 Nehru, probably better than All, recognizes the lack of
 support in Asia for a new nonaggression treaty.   Pakistan is
 already committed to the Manila agreement.   The Ceylonese gov-
 ernment is sympathetic toward it.  Even in Indonesia, there are
 strong objections to a nonaggression pact.   The prospect for
 any firm agreement evolving from Nehru's visit to Peiping there=
 fore appears to be dim.

 CURRENT SOVIET ATTENTION TO CHINA
 The Soviet Union utilized the fifth anniversary of the
 founding of the Chinese People's Republic to make its most
 lavish demonstration to date of friendship and regard for
 China.      The Soviet delegation to Peiping, headed by Khrushchev,
 and including his fellow Presidium members Bulganin and Mikoyan,
 the editor of Pravda and the minister of culture, was the high-
 est level delegation to leave the USSR since Malenkov and
 Zhdanov went to the opening of the Cominform in 1947.  This
 is the first time Soviet leaders of such stature have made a
 public visit to China.   In Moscow the remaining six Presidium
 members, including Malenkov and Molotov, attended the Chinese
 ambassador's reception.
 This unprecedented attention climaxes a growing Soviet
 acknowledgment over the past 18 months of the role of China
 in the Communist world.  With the end of the Korean war,
 Moscow stepped up its promotion Of China's stature as a world
 power whose recognition is essential for world peace and used
 the Geneva conference to reinforce this thesis.  Since the
 death" of Stalin, Moscow has also begun to recognize Mao as
 a Marxist theoretician, and this year accorded him the un-
 usual honor of including him in the official philosophical
 dictionary, the only living Communist leader-so listed.
 This trend has been accompanied by Soviet economic aid
 to China which, although it has included key industrial and
 military equipment, has been modest in scale.   There has been
 little emphasis by the USSR of its military commitment to
 Peiping under the Sino-Soviet treaty.  Moscow has stressed
 instead, particularly since the Korean settlement, that China
 is the "stabilizing factor" for peace in the Far East.
 Peiping has always been far more eager to make explicit the
 joint obligations of the Sino-Soviet treaty than has Moscow,
 China's recent moves against Formosa and the offshore
 islands have evoked little official response from the USSR.
 Soviet media have been cautious in reporting Chinese claims,
 initiating little independent comment and relying largely
 on quoting Chinese statements.   Any mention of Soviet commit-
 ment under the Sino-Soviet treaty has been scrupulously
 avoided.
 This general Sovi,et;pattern was followed by Khrushchev
 in his address~,n? Peiping on 2 October.   The Soviet party
 leader paid great tribute to China's accomplishments in

 preparing for Socialism, reaffirmed the inviolability of Sino-
 Soviet friendship,and'reiterated the current Soveit stress on
 peaceful  coexistence.  He commended Chou--En-lei's call for con-
 sultations among Asian powers based on his five principles of
 nonaggression.
 Although Khrushchev gave the first general pledge of
 support by a top-ranking Soviet leader to Peiping's desire
 to "liberate" Formosa, he avoided the question of the kind,
 degree and timing of Soviet support.  He made no mention of
 the Sino-Soviet treaty in connection with Formosa.
 Ambassador Bohlen,in commenting on these points, noted
 that the Khrushchev speech seemed to put the USSR behind the
 Chinese position on Formosa, but that he found it difficult
 to believe Moscow was prepared to run a serious risk of in-
 volvement in a major war on this issue.  He further reported
 that in Moscow,Malenkov, Molotov, and Voroshilov rather point-
 edly ignored any reference to the liberation of Formosa in
 their replies to the Chinese ambassador's toast to China's
 determination to achieve this goal.
 Bohlen found further evidence of the USSR's desire to
 soft-pedal the degree of its commitment to the Formosa cam-
 paign in an unusual procedure employed by the Soviet censor in
 dealing with the Moscow AP correspondent's story on the
 Khrushchev speech.  The censor pointed out that the journalist
 had incorrectly quoted Khrushchev as stating that the "Soviet
 Union supported China's determination'.' on the Formosa issue,
 whereas Khrushchev had merely said that the "Soviet people"
 supported this.
 In his speech, Khrushchev failed to repeat the long-
 standing Soviet,boast of:'having played the major role in
 defeating Japan in World War II.  He acknowledged for the
 first time that the Soviet army came "to aid" the Chinese
 people after the USSR had defeated Hitler.  He also went
 beyond any previous Soviet spokesman by explicitly crediting
 the Chinese Communist Party'with having evolved the "brilliant
 strategy and tactics" of the Chinese revolution.  He stated
 that the "Chinese people are advancing along the correct
 road of their own."  Prior to Stalin's death, Soviet theore-
 ticians had shown great reluctance to acknowledge the success
 of Mao's early tactics, which were at times in direct contrast
 to those proclaimed by the Comintern under Stalin.
 Khrushchev spoke of future Soviet economic aid mainly
 in the form of assistance to the 141 projects announced in
 1953 as the Soviet contribution to China's first Five-Year
 Plan.  But the Chinese were assured "that the Soviet people
 will continue to be their trustworthy, true friends9! and will
 support future Chinese development.

 FRENCH PERSONNEL CHANGES TEND TO FAVOR COMMUNISTS
 AND HOBBLE PRO-AMERICANS
 While the current. extensive reshuffling of key French
 government personnel appears to be primarily an effort by
 the Mendes-France regime to entrench itself, it has resulted
 in the transfer of many pro-American officials to relatively
 unimportant posts.   There is also evidence that the government
 has followed a "soft policy" toward Communists.  The replace-
 ment of pro-American officials apparently springs from a
 desire for "more independent" policies; current disclo-
 sures of Communist infiltration, however, will probably force
 Mendes-France to come to grips with the problem of Communist
 influence in the government.
 Personnel shifts in the Foreign Ministry have already
 removed from several key spots officials who were close to
 former foreign minister Bidault.  While numerous transfers
 could be expected during what amounts to the first drastic
 administrative shake-up under the Fourth Republic, even the
 French press is speculating that the premier is deliberately
 shifting pro-American officials to relatively remote or in-
 active spots.
 Among the most important changes has been the replace-
 ment of outspokenly pro-EDC Herve Alphand, permanent delegate
 to NATO, by Maurice Couve de Murville, former ambassador to
 Egypt, who in the past has not hesitated to undercut Bidault's
 pro-American policies.   Pro-American Guy de la Tournelle,
 since 1950 director of political affairs and third-ranking
 official in the Foreign Ministry, has been appointed ambas-
 sador to Spain.
 Pierre de Leusse, who resigned last year. as head of the
 Foreign Ministry's press section in protest against Bidault's
 pro-EDC policy, has just been appointed ambassador to Warsaw.
 The significance of this move may become clear if Pierre
 Charpentier, who is scheduled for a post abroad when his
 present office is set up as a new Ministry of Foreign Trade,
 is also assigned to an Orbit country,  Charpentier is known
 to favor expanded East-West trade, has worked for a reduction
 in strategic trade controls, and claims to have Mendes-France's
 support for continued trade with north Vietnam.

 Considerable concern has been expressed in the press and
 among the opposition over the government's move to tighten
 control over channels of information.   The recent appointment
 of a new direotor of the semiofficial Agence France Presse
 has been explained publicly by a government spokesman as a
 move to give the agency "a greater independence in its in-
 formationo"  The new director is a close associate of Interior
 Minister Mitterrand, who has been regarded as lenient toward
 Communists. The appointment of a new director of the nation-
 alized radio is also planned.
 Mendes-France has already shown his willingness to
 manipulate the press.   Just prior to the assembly vote on EDC,
 the government ordered AFP to withhold news of Britain's
 clarification of its stand on the defense community.
 Even in the early weeks of the Mendes-France regime,
 when the premier was occupied at Geneva, there were indica-
 tions the new government would follow a 14soft policy" toward.
 Communists.   The reappointment of an avowed Communist to the
 National Center of Scientific Research in early July was
 noted by the American embassy in Paris as reversing the trend
 of previous governments toward removing Communists from
 sensitive positions.
 Most recently, political adversaries of the premier
 have seized on the dismissal of police inspector Jean Dides,
 head of an anti-Communist section, as another indication of
 Mendes-France's bad faith and pro-Communist leanings.   The
 subsequent revelation of information leaks by key defense
 officials to Communists has, however, removed the finger of
 suspicion from Mendes-France in this matter, although the
 extent of Mitterrand's involvement is still not clear.
 The leaks of secret defense information, described in
 the press as "France's biggest postwar scandal," have already
 led to the questioning of top Communist leaders.  An aroused
 public opinion will. probably compel Mendes-France to give
 attention to the problem of his own relationship with the
 Communist Party.   This may result in friction between the
 premier and some of his closest advisers.

 EGYPT FACES CRITICAL  TEST OF ITS INFLUENCE IN THE SUDAN
 Egyptian prestige in the Sudan has been impaired by re-
 cent developments in Cairo and by serious dissensions within
 the governing National Unionist Party in the Sudan.   Popular
 support for the pro-Egyptian Unionist Party is threatened by
 growing coolness toward the Nasr regime among leaders of the
 important Moslem Khatmia sect.   As the majority of the Union-
 ist Party deputies belong to this sect, Prime Minister Azhari's
 prounionist  policies may face new difficulties when the Suda-
 nese parliament reconvenes in November.
 Differences between Nagib and Nasr,  further dissension
 within the Revolutionary Command Council, and the Cairo re-
 gime's policy toward the Moslem Brotherhood have lessened Su-
 danese desire for political union with Egypt.   Many of the
 Khatmia initially supported the Egyptian-dominated Unionist
 Party solely as a means of ending British administration of
 the country.  This element now resents Egypt's efforts to ex-
 tend its influence and to manipulate Sudanese politics.
 The Unionist Party won its victory in the November 1953
 elections for the first Sudanese self-governing parliament,
 thanks largely to the popular support of the Khatmia.   Prime
 Minister Azhari has accordingly sought to maintain a balance
 inthe cabinet between Khatmia and prounionist   politicians.
 All Mirghani, head of the Khatmia, is considered the most
 influential figure on the Sudanese political scene.   The grow-
 ing friction between Mirghani and the Nasr regime constitutes
 a serious threat to Azhari's prounionist   government.   It also
 lessens the prospect that the Sudanese will choose political
 union with Egypt rather than independence when they vote on
 their future status at some date before January 1957.
 Major Salah Salim's sudden and unexpected visit to Khar-
 toum on 30 September to confer with Unionist Party officials
 suggests that the Nasr regime is concerned over the split with-
 in the party and Egypt's declining influence among tae Khatmia.
 If Major Salim is unable to effect a reconciliation between the
 two factions,  Egypt may expect a further loss of influence in
 the Sudan and increasing opposition to union of the two coun-
 tries.

 COMMUNIST CHINA'S NEW GOVERNMENT
 The choice of the men who will fill the principal positions
 in the new Chinese Communist government discloses significant
 changes in the relative standing of Chinese leaders, although
 the top four officials are not affected (see chart, p. 16).  The
 election conducted in the Chinese National People's Congress in
 September supports indications of the past several years that
 the big four, in order, are Mao Tse-tung, Liu Shao-chi, Chou
 En-lai and Chu Teh.
 Mao, who is to be chairman of the Republic for four more
 years, will almost certainly remain in over-all control, although
 his activity may be reduced by ill-health.  Liu, as chairman of
 the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, will be
 in a position to exercise power second only to Mao's and, appar-
 ently, to assume primary authority on Mao's death or incapacita-
 tion.  Chou En-lai will continue as premier and foreign minister
 in the number three job.  Chu Teh, as the only vice chairman of
 the Republic, will be the formal successor to Mao's office,
 although not to his authority.
 Administration of government affairs is in the hands of the
 State Council, consisting of 35 ministers and commission chair-
 men and presided over by Chou En-lai.   In nearly all cases,
 ministers who were replaced were named vice chairmen or members
 of the Standing `Committee . of,. 1tus. tcong'es ",;:,where they will be
 under the supervision of Liu Shao-chi and will not have a direct
 hand in the daily administration of the government.
 Peng Teh-huai, until recently commander of Chinese Communist
 forces in Korea, has apparently assumed direct control of the
 armed forces in place of former commander in chief Chu Teh.
 Peng was named as the new minister.. of national defense, a
 position he is expected to fill aggressively and well.
 Both Peng and Chu are among the15,vice chairmen of the
 new National Defense Council, as are all field army commanders.
 Since there is no direct command channel: between this body and
 the new Ministry of National Defense, the council will probably
 function largely as an advisory body to Peng and to Mao Tse-
 tung, who heads the council.
 The rapid rise of Teng Hsiao-ping in recent years was
 confirmed during the congress, as Peiping identified him for
 the first time as a member of the Chinese Communist Party

 politburo.  Teng retained his position as a vice premier and
 was also appointed a vice chairman of the National Defense
 Council.
 A similar rise in the stature of J.i Fu-chun was confirmed
 by the congress, which named him to replace Kao Kang as chairman}
 of the important State Planning Commission, one of the two-or
 three top jobs in the Chinese Communist economy.   Li, who may
 like Teng be a new member of the politburo, was formerly second
 in importance to Kao Kang in Manchuria.
 The congress appeared to confirm the fall from favor of
 Kao Kang, long the party's boss in Manchuria and until this
 year one of Communist China's big five.  Kao, who has been out
 of the news since January of this year, was not mentioned in
 any way during the congress session and has apparently been
 disciplined sharply for challenging the party leadership.
 Li Li-san, onetime leader of the Chinese Communist Party
 and rival of Mao Tse-tung, was also dealt a blow by the con-
 gress, in that he was not retained as minister of labor or
 named to any other post.   Li had been made the scapegoat in
 1931 for the failure of the Comintern line in China in previous
 years., and was ordered to Moscow for, reindoctrination.  He
 returned to China in 1945, reportedly as a Kremlin-supported
 check on Mao, and was re-elected at that time to the party's
 central committee, but he never regained anything approaching
 his former power.
 Two other major figures seem to be in trouble, judging
 from the proceedings of the congress.   Jao Shu-shih, who had
 been director of the party's highly important organization
 department and the regime's top official in East China, was
 completely ignored by the congress.  An Tzu-wen, a theorist
 who had been Jao's deputy in the organization department,
 lost his job as minister of personnel for the government when
 that post was eliminated by the congress, and he was not given
 any other job.
