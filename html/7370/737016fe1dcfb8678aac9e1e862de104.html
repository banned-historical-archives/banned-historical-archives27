 28 APRIL 1971
 INDOCHINA
 Hanoi and Front media continue to exploit the U.S. antiwar
 demonstrations in standard fashion.  Propaganda includes official
 messages to the U.S. sponsoring organizations and a NHAN DAN
 editorial on 26 April, entitled "The Days that Shake the United
 States," which observes that the participants this year include
 more peopi.e "from the upper strata and political circles" than
 previously.  On the same day Front and Hanoi media publicized a
 PLAF Command Order instructing the communist forces in South
 Vietnam cn the proper attitudes and actions to be taken toward
 U.S. servicemen who oppose the war.
 Vietnamese communist comment on action in South Vietnam claims
 that the fighting shows the strength of the PLAF and the losing
 position of the allies in central Vietnam; and a PLAF Command
 message to combztants in the central highlands calls for more
 vigorous attacks and "uprisings" leading to total victory.  Calls
 for intensified struggle also appear in propaganda pegged to May
 Day and the 27 April anniversary of the founding of the South
 Vietnam Liberation Trade Union Federation.
 The first anniversary of the Indochinese people's summit conference
 (24-25 April) provides the occasion for reiterations of communist
 claims of "strategic victories" in the recent operations in Laos
 and Cambodia.  Propaganda on the anniversary includes publicity
 for a Peking banquet hosted by Sihanouk and addressed by Chou
 En-lai, who again described the Indochinese struggle in glowing
 terms.
 Peking comment on the U.S. antiwar demonstrations includes a
 27 April PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial which says that "a new
 revolutionary storm is rising vigorously among the people of the
 United States."
 Moscow has carried no editorial comment on the U.S. antiwar
 activities, but there is some routine comment in addition to TASS
 reports.  Soviet broadcasts in Mandarin continue to castigate
 Peking for rejecting united action in aiding the Indochinese and
 to note that Peking's friendly gestures toward the United States
 come at a time when the United States is escalating the war; a
 26 April commentary goes so far as to say that the "real meaning"
 of the Sino-U.S. contacts is "to obstruct the Indochinese people's
 war" against U.S. aggression.

 people" and says the Vietnamese people "regarded it as a
 valuable support cn4 encouragement to them."  Also on the
 26th, VNA reported a meeting held in Hanoi that evening by
 the Committee for Solidarity with the American people to
 welcome the 1971 U.S. spring offensive "demanding immediate
 and total withdrawal of U.S. trcops from Vietnam and an end
 to the war."  Hoang Minh Giam, chairman of the committee,
 opened the meeting*; the main address was given by dice
 Chairman Dang Thai Mai, who according to VNA "warmly welcomed
 the spring offensive" and cited the "mammoth" demonstrations
 of the 24th.  VNA reported that Mai "warmly hailed the antiwar
 movement" which is "valiantly confronting the most bellicose
 and barbarous administration ever seen in the history of
 America."  The movement, he said, constituted "great encourage-
 ment to the fight of the Vietnamese people."
 The VNA report notes that the meeting passed a resolution
 "warmly welcoming" the spring offensive, "vehemently denouncing"
 Vietnamization, "resolutely demanding" that the United States
 end the war, and "pledging determination to stand shoulder to
 shoulder witt? the Lao and Cambodian peoples to fight until
 total victory."
 PLAF CONti1AND ORDER     Coincident with the focus of propaganda
 attention on the U.S. demonstrations,
 both Hanoi radio in its English-language program for U.S.
 servicemen and Liberation Radio publicized a PLAF Command
 order--dated the sane day--instructing PLAY forces on the
 proper attitude and actions to be taken toward U.S. servicemen
 who oppose the war.  The order pictures a growing U.S.
 opposition to the war, including servicemen who have returned
 to the United States.  And it says many American servicemen
 still in South Vietnam have urged an end to the war, op:osed
 orders of their commanders, and demanded an immediate withdrawal
 of U.S. troops.  It states that on a number of occasions the
 NFLSV and PRG have made clear that their policy is to welcome
 U.S. servicemen who oppose the war and to give humane treatment
 to U.S. soldiers captured or wounded on the battlefield.
 The order instructs troops to refrain from attacking certain
 U.S. troops, to give them "proper treatment," to assist deserters,
 *  VNA on the 17th had reported a message from Giam to the
 American people.  See the TRENDS of 21 April 1971, pages 4-5.

 and to "hail and appropriately reward the U.S. servicemen who
 support the NFLSV and PRG."  The order calls on U.S. officers
 and men to "seek by all means to contact and inform the South
 Vietnamese people and the southern PLAF of their planned
 antiwar act'.on so that the southern people and PLAF can help
 them."
 BACKGROUND:  Appeals to allied soldiers to desert or defect i:
 a low-level staple of Vietnamese communist propaganda.  But
 there have also been appeals in the past on an official level.
 The PRG issued an appeal on 23 December 1969 which urged U.S.
 servicemen to oppose the war by "refraining from conducting
 sweeps, from staging shellings, and from taking hostile action
 against the PLAF."  Liberation Radio on 10 July 1970, in
 announcing that permission had been granted John M. Sweeney
 to leave Vietnam for Sweden, said the action was in line with
 the "humanitarian" policy spelled out in the December. 1969
 appeal.  On 15 November 1967 the South Vietnam People's
 Committee for Solidarity with the American People--established
 the preceding month--addressed a letter to American soldiers
 in South Vietnam urging them to refuse to fight and offering
 them help.
 NATURE AND SCOPE       Hanoi and the Front are inconsistent in
 OF DEMONSTRATIONS      identifying the organizations sponsoring
 the U.S. demonstrations.  But messages
 have been addressed to both the National Peace Action Coalition
 nra the People's Coalition for Peace and Justice from NFLSV
 Central Committee Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho (on the 25th) and
 from the South Vietnam Liberation Youth Union (on the 22d).
 The South Vietnam People's Committee for Solidarity with the
 American People addressed its letter (on the 23d) to the
 American people,  Tho's message, as broadcast by Liberation
 Radio on the :.7th, says the spring offensive "will certainly
 score great success and advance toward a new high tide that
 will force Nixon to immediately end the war" and withdraw all
 U.S. troops unconditionally.
 The propaganda notes that there were "massive" demonstrations
 in San Francisco as well as in Washington on the 24th, and the
 figure of 500,000 demonstrators is claimed for both cities.
 Earlier, Hanoi had duly hailed the activities of the Vietnam
 Veterans Against the War.  VNA noted on the 25th that a
 "coalition of militant antiwar activists  announced that they
 would try to shut down Congress and other government activity"

 in the coming weeks.  And on the 27th VNA cited foreign sources
 as reporting that the "second phase" %)f the spring offensive
 had begun ;n the 26th.  Liberation Radio on the came day pointed
 out that the second phase has been organized by the People's
 Coalition for Peace and Justice, and it mentioiied such specific
 actions as the sit-ins at the Selective Service and Internal
 Revenue Service offices.
 AT';ACKS ON THE PRESIDENT     The NHAN DAN editorial of the 26th
 IN NHAN DAN AND AT PARIS      is notably abusive toward the
 President, claiming that while
 speaking of U.S. honor, "it is Nixon himself who has cast slurs on
 the honor of the United States" through the "crimes" committed
 in Indochina.  It charges that since the President took office,
 his Indochina poliey has consisted of two parts:  "to prolong
 and extend the war and fool the American people."  It claims
 that to "defuse" the antiwar movement the Administration has
 resorted "to all means--slanders, threats, terror, and division
 coupled with empty promises, dilatory moves, and the fanning
 of great-nation chauvinism."  The version of the editorial
 broadcast by Hanoi radio elaborates:  It says that the
 Administration has tried to silence U.S. congressmen "through
 their unsigned threatening letters from the FBI" and that it
 has "terrorized the press and refused to disclose news on the
 Indochinese battlefields in an attempt to make the American
 people know and believe what they want them to know and believe."
 At the 110th session of the Paris talks on 22 April, both DRV
 delegate Xuan Thuy and FRG delegate Mme. Nguyen Thi Binh used
 the current demonstrations to highlight their negotiating
 demands.  Scoring the President's 7 April TV address in which
 he announced an additional 100,000-man troop withdrawal and
 his 16 April remarks to newspaper editors, in particular his
 refusal to set a deadline for all U.S. troops to be withdrawn
 from South Vietnam, the communist delegates cited the
 demonstrations as evidence that U.S. public opinion is
 "indignant" at the President's refusal to set such a deadline.
 In remarks summarized broadly by VNA, Thuy asserted that at
 present, "all over the United States, the American people are
 waging an energetic spring offensive to compel the Nixon
 Administration to respond to the imperative demand that a
 deadline be fixed . . . ."  LPA says Mme. Binh "laid particular
 stress on the vigorous development of the movement of the South
 Vietnam townsfolk and the unprecedently strong growth" of the

 American people's movement for an end to the war, a deadline for
 total U.S. withdrawal, and renunciation by the Administration
 of the "Thieu-Ky-Khiem clique of traitors."
 SOUPHANOUVONG LETTER         The Pathet Lao news agency on 25 April
 TO AMERICAN PEOPLE           reported what it called Prince
 Souphanouvong's "second" letter to the
 American people, dated the 21st.  He says that in his "first"
 letter, dated 19 February and carried by the Pathet Lao news
 agency the next day, he had called attention to the "grave
 situation" in Laos as a result of the invasion of southern
 Laos by "U.S. and Saigon puppet troops."  In his latest letter
 he tells the American people of the "important victories" of
 the Lao "patriotic forces and people," saying that the
 victories cannot be separated from the solidarity and support
 of the peoples of the world, including the American people
 "who, by their waves of antiwar protests spreading across the
 country, have struck vigorously at the war policy pursued by
 the White House leaders."  He praises the American spring
 antiwar campaign, noting that it includes diversified sectors
 of the population ranging from veterans to "Democratic and
 even Republican senators."
 Although Souphanouvong calls his 19 February message his first
 letter to the American people, he had in fact sent a similiar
 letter dated 8 November 1969 praising the antiwar demonstrations
 at that time.  Other Pathet Lao leaders, Phoumi Vongvichit and
 Tiao Souk Vongsak, as well as the leader of the Patriotic
 Neutralist Forces, Khamsouk Keola, also lent messages in 1969.
 There were apparently no such letters in connection with the
 May 1970 U.S. demonstrations against the Cambodian incursion,
 however.

 PEKING SEES GROUNDSWELL OF SUPPORT FOR U.S. DEMONSTRATIONS
 Highlighted by a PEOPLE'S DAILY worker-commentators' article
 on 26 April and a PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial on the 27t1,
 Peking's continuing publicity for the "unprecedented massive
 demonstrations and rallies" against President Nixon's
 Indochina policies stresses the involvement of Americans
 of all classes, races, and occupations, "standing on the
 same front with the three Indochinese peoples and the
 peoples of all the other countries struggling against
 U.S. imperialism."
 Observing that "a new revolutionary storm is rising
 vigorously among the people of the United States" and
 that the 24 April demonstrations "pushed the struggle
 to a new high tide," the PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial pointed
 out that "workers, black people, students, and women,
 people of all classes and strata and of different occupa-
 tions, beliefs, races, and ages have joined the demonstra-
 tions" despite intimidations and "threats from the U.S.
 Government."  Taking particular note of the involvement
 of U.S. servicemen, including Vietnam veterans, the
 editorial asserted that "all this reflects the new
 awakening of the American people."  It observed that
 "a situation like this is rarely seen in history--the
 people of a country so courageously opposing their own
 country's imperialist war of aggression."
 In similar vein, the PEOPLE'S DAILY article by worker-
 commentators hailed "the American people's rising
 revolutionary storm against aggression" and stated
 that "the broad masses of the American people are an
 important battalion in the anti-U.S. united front of
 the people throughout the world."
 Other Peking comment has highlighted the participation
 of the veterans, noting that they "staged dramatic scenes
 on the Capitol steps to expose the outrageous crimes
 committed by U.S. aggressor troops."  They are said to
 have "won wide support from the American people,
 especially the Washington residents, many of whom took
 part in the protest activities organized by the veterans."
 NCNA on the 26th said that "U.S. imperialist chieftain
 Nixon was so frightened that he sneaked away from Washington"
 prior to the demonstrations on the 24th.  Apart from this
 reference, however, Peking's propaganda on the demonstrations
 has avoided personal abuse of the President.

 MOSCOW GIVES DEMONSTRATIONS LIMITED. ROUTINE ATTENTION
 Soviet media's  news  coverage of the U.S. antiwar demonstrations
 has featured the activities of the Vietnam Veterans Against the
 War, the weekend "mass demonstrations," and plans for the 10-day
 "peace offensive" sponsored by the People's Coalition for Peace
 and Justice.   Brief TASS reports and correspondents' dispatches
 in the press have been accompanied by some routine-level comment.
 In a dispatch carried by TASS on the 26th, PRAVDA's correspondent
 pointed out that the Saturday demonstration in Washington had
 "new features," including the participation of middle-aged
 people, workers; and members of minority groups.  He saw in
 this demonstration and in others a "new upsurge" of the antiwar
 movement in the United States, contrary to the expectations of
 "certain political observers" who had recently expressed the
 view that Vietnamization had taken the steam out of the movement.
 A radio commentary in English, also on the 26th, said the
 demonstrations show that "the so-called silent majority is not
 so silent any more."  Although the Administration has the
 mass media at its disposal and the widest publicity has been
 given to the President's speeches defending his policies, the
 commentator said, no arguments or propaganda can repair the
 split in the country or overcome the crisis of confidence.
 MAY DAY, TU ANNIVERSARY PROMPT CONINENT ON SOUTHERN "STRUGGLE"
 The 10th anniversary of the South Vietnamese Liberation Trade
 Union on 27 April and the approaching May Day holiday prompt
 comment by the Front radio hailing the workers' struggle in
 the South and calling for further efforts to overthrow the
 Saigon regime and. force a U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam.  A
 Liberation Radio commentary on 25 April scored a GVN ban on
 May Day demonstrations and declared that the workers and
 urban people are "determined not to retreat in the face of
 difficulties."  It added that the ban will not prevent May
 Day activities in South Vietnamese cities such as the holding
 of meetings and the gathering of "struggle forces" during
 parades and demonstrations in the streets, at headquarters,
 in factories, and elsewhere.

 An appeal from the Liberation Trade Union Federation Executive
 Committee, broadcast by the Front radio on the 26th, marked
 May Day and the Federation anniversary with a more general call
 for stepped-up struggle against the Saigon regime.  While
 warning of "hard, difficult, and complicated circumstances" to
 be faced in GVN-controlled areas before "total victory" is
 achieved, the appeal confidently claimed that "the final phase
 of our struggle" is underway and expressed determination to
 "advance the revolution to total victory."
 Hanoi marked the Liberation Trade Union Federation's anniversary
 with a meeting organized by the DRV trade union federation on
 24 April.  A Hanoi broadcast to the South on the 26th reported
 that VWP.Secretariat member Nguyen Van Tran and DRV Vice Premier
 Do Muoi attended the meeting and that the northern trade union's
 vice-president and secretary general, Nguyen Due Thuan,
 delivered a speech hailing the workers' struggle in the South.

 DRV, NFLSV DERIDE "IMAGINARY" LAM SON 720 OPERATION IN A SHAU
 The first Vietnamese communist acknowledgment of the details of
 Operation Lam Son 720 in the A Shau valley came in a 21 April
 Liberation Radio commentary attribut!d co the station's
 commentator "Nguoi Ban Tia" (The Sniier).*  The commentator
 claimed that the Western press had "laid bare the deceitful
 nature" of this operation and he quoted, among other things,
 a Western news report speculating that the allies are
 "'spreading misleading news'" to "'confuse the communists"'
 and observing that only reconnaissance troops are operating
 in the A Shau valley.  Dismissing Lam Son 720 as a
 "psychological plot aimed at making stupid people believe
 that the U.S.-puppets still remain strong" after Lam Son 719,
 the Front commentator concluded:  "The U.S.-puppets tried at
 all costs to send a few small detachments to the jungle area
 in Western Thua Thien and then boastfully clamored that a
 big operation haO. been conducted there."
 Hanoi first discussed Lam Son 720 in an article in the 22 April
 QUAN DOI NHAN DAN which cited contradictory Western news
 reports about the operation and derided it as "fake."  It
 charged that Gen. Abrams and President Thieu "boasted" about
 "this imaginary Lam Son 720" in order to conceal allied
 s,,tbacks" both in southern Laos and in the South Vietnamese
 hi,nlands.  Unlike the Liberation Radio commentary, the Hanoi
 paper took note of a Western news agency report that Abrams
 had raised the possibility of Saigon troops engaged in the
 operation crossing the border into Laos.
 COMMUNISTS REVIEW THREE MONTHS OF "VICTORIES" IN CAMBODIA
 Alleged victories of the Cambodian "liberation" forces in the
 first three months of the year are recounted in a 22 April
 report from the Cambodian Information Agen-y (AKI), an organ
 of Sihanouk's front.  The report highlights action along
 Highway 4 and in the Phnom Penh area as wel_ as communist
 attacks on South Vietnamese forces engaged in Operation

 speech in Hue on the 17th merely noted his reference to the
 launching of Lam Son 720.

 Toan Thang (Total Victory) 1/71 in northeast Cambodia.  It
 also claims that "encroachment and pacification operations" by
 Phnom Penh's main forces have been rebuffed by the liberation
 forces.
 The AKI report credits the "people" and the "Cambodian liberation
 army" (CNPLAF) in the first three months of 1971 with having
 "eliminated or captured" 25,000 troops, including 14,000 South
 Vietnamese.  In addition, 350 aircraft were allegedly downed or
 destroyed and 1,400 military vehicles destroyed, including 600
 tanks and armored cars.  The allies, according to AKI, also
 lost 120 guns and over 60 vessels, and thousands of arms were
 allegedly captured by the CNPLAF.
 The AKI report repeats communist claims that the GVN Toan
 Thang 1/71 has been "defeated"; but it acknowledges the
 continuation of the operation in noting that the allies are
 currently "throwing other units" into it, adding that they
 have "been unable to reverse their unfavorable situation."
 Beginning in mid-March Vietnamese and Cambodian propaganda
 claimed that Toan Thang 1/71 was defeated, with some comment
 stating that the allies had to abandon the operation only a
 month after its initiation on 4 February.
 AKI echoes battle reports in recent weeks which have claimed
 that South Vietnamese units involved in Toan Thang 1/71 have
 been forced to abandon numerous positions.  Thus it maintains
 that GVN troops have been "forced to retreat" from Chup, Suong,
 and Damber and find themselves "in a critical situation" in
 Khnar, Pratheat, and Kandol Chrum--on Highway 7--and Snoul--on
 Highway 13.  It claims that the CNPLAF, in action since the
 start of the GVN operation, has killed, wounded, or captured
 nearly 13,000 troops, putting out of action 21 infantry
 battalions and 12 armored squadrons.  In addition, 200 planes
 have allegedly been shot down or destroyed during this period
 and 1,100 military vehicles put out of action, including more
 than 550 tanks and armored cars.
 These alleged achievements of the CNPLAF?are hailed in
 25 April editorials in NHAN DAN and QUAN DOI NHAN DAN pegged
 to the anniversary of the Indochinese people's summit
 conference.  NHAN DAN amplifies on the victory claims,
 commenting that the number of Saigon troops "annihilated" in
 Toan Thang 1/71 is more than three-fourths of the number
 lost on the southern Laos front and that the number of tanks
 and armored cars destroyed equals those destroyed in southern

 Laos.  The editorials, like AKI, hold that military victories
 in Cambodia are a blow to the Administration's Vietnamization
 plan and Nixon Doctrine and to the Phnom Penh regime, which is
 said to be seriously isolated and plagued by internal contra-
 dictions.  Hailing both the Laotian and Cambodian "victories"
 this year, NHAN DAN concludes that a "new situation" has
 arisen on the Indochinese battlefields and that the Indochinese
 people and armed forces "are ready to engage ourselves in new,
 resolute battles, to change the balance of forces increasingly
 in our favor, and to advance toward completely defeating the
 U.S. aggressors."
 FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN DENOUNCES U,S, BOMBING OF DRV
 The nature of recent U.S. air strikes, reportedly aimed at
 North Vietnamese missile sites and air bases, is not acknow-
 ledged by Hanoi, which issued only routine DRV Foreign Ministry
 spokesman's statements on 22 and 24 April protesting strikes in
 Quang Binh and in Nghe An and Ha Tinh provinces, respectively,
 as well as in the northern parts of the DMZ.  Typically the
 reported U.S. contact with North Vietnamese MIGs on the 23d
 is ignored.
 The protest on the 22d says that on the 18th and 20th, U.S.
 aircraft "bombed and strafed a number of populated areas in
 Quang Binh Province, causing losses in lives and property."*
 Hanoi media on the 23d reported the downing of two U.S.
 planes in Nghe An and Ha Tinh provinces on the previous day.
 And VNA specified that the downing in Nghe An "by the
 people's armed forcer" occurred during a "counterattack
 against an air raid  on a populated area in the western part
 of the province."  These U.S. actions are scored in the
 foreign ministry spokesman's protest on the 24th which notes the
 downings and in standard language voices determination "to
 duly punish all U.S. reckless acts of encroachment on DRV
 territory."  Hanoi on the 28th claims that another plane was
 downed that day in Ha Tinh, bringing its total to 3,392.
 *  The spokesman's statement of the 22d describes action which
 seems to correspond to the strike which the U.S. command in
 Saigon said occurred on the 19th against a surface-to-air
 missile site.  Later in the week the U.S. command said that U.S.
 fighter-bombers on the 22d bombed DRV missile and antiaircraft
 sites and that one raid penetrated 185 miles into North Vietnam
 for strikes against a MIG air base.

 The protest of the 22d also charges that on 16-18 April U.S.
 aircraft, including B-52's, "on several occasions" bombed
 Huong Lap village and "used its artillery from positions on
 the sea and south of the DMZ to shell Vinh Son village."
 It stresses that these two villages are "located north of
 the 17th parallel in the DMZ."  The foreign ministry spokesman
 in the pretest of the 24th similarly charges that U.S. air-
 craft, including B-52's, bombed Huong Lap village--this time
 on the 21st and 22d.  And it charges that U.S. artillery "off
 the coast and from south of the DMZ shelled villages north
 of the 17th parallel in the DMZ," but makes no specific
 mention of any village.  It echoes the protest of the 22d that
 "all these villages belong to the DRV."
 The alleged downing of U.S. planes on the 22d is lauded in a
 Hanoi radio commentary on the 23d which says that to make up
 for allied losses on all Indochinese battlefields the United
 States is "pez,petrating military adventures against our North
 with many perfidious tricks."  And a QUAN DOI NHAN DAN
 commentary on the 24th says that the U.S. "systematic acts of
 war against the DRV" were shown by the repeated air strikes on
 16-18 and on 20 April and by the "admittance" of the U.S.
 command in Saigon on the 23d "that the order had been given
 to the U.S. Air Force and Navy to attack various parts of
 North Vietnam."
 ANNIVERSARY OF INDOCHINESE PEOPLE IS SLMIIT CONFERENCE MARKED
 The first anniversary of the Indochinese summit conference
 (24-25 April) provides the occasion for reaffirmations of the
 pledge to persist in the struggle against the U.S. "aggressors."
 Propaganda on the anniversary includes editorials in the Hanoi
 and Peking press and publicity for a Peking banquet, hosted by
 Sihanouk and attended by Chou En-lai, a Hanoi meeting, sponsored
 by the Vietnam Fatherland Front and attended by Pham Van Dong,
 as well as meetings in South Vietnamese and Laotian "liberated
 areas."
 At the Peking banquet, the Indochinese speakers voiced explicit
 gratitude for Chinese assistance as well as general appreciation
 for support and assistance from "other socialist countries."
 The PRG charge d'affaires and the DPRK ambassador at the banquet
 recalled that Chou En-lai, during his March visit to Hanoi,
 had warned that if the United States expanded the war the Chinese

 people would "take all necessary measures, not flinching even
 from the greatest national sacrifices, to give all-out
 sui_Drt and assistance" to the Vietnamese and Indochinese
 peoples.  Peking's comment has not on its own authority
 repeated this pledge since the 11 March PEOPLE'S DAILY
 editorial on Chou's visit.*
 In his banquet address, Chou routinely said that the Chinese
 "firmly support and assist" the people of Vietnam, Laos, and
 Cambodia. And consistent with propaganda on the Laos
 incursion, he professed optimism regarding the Indochinese
 situation. Referring to growing opposition to the Nixon
 Administration's war policies at home and abroad, as well as
 the "struggle" of the Indochinese people, Chou said that "the
 U.S. aggressors and their lackeys have never before been so
 isolated and in such a difficult position as they are today."
 Similarly optimistic, the 25 April PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial
 recalled the assertion in Mao's 20 May 1970 statement that
 "the situation is getting better and better" in the Indochinese
 struggle, and it praised the victories of the Indochinese
 people in the past year since the summit conference.  The
 editorial said that President Nixon "is having a much tougher
 time," particularly since the Highway 9 battle, as the American
 people's struggle demanding an end to the war has grown and
 "internal disputes" within the "ruling clique" and "contradictions"
 between the United States and its "puppets" have become more acute.
 The editorial concludes with a routine pledge to give "all-out
 support" to the Indochinese people.
 Sihanouk routinely referred to China as the "reliable and
 invincible great rear area" cf the Indochinese people, and
 the DRV ambassador similarly said that the victories of the
 three countries are linked to "the devoted, precious, timely,
 adequate" support of the Chinese people who are acting as
 "a firm rear."
 The Pathet Lao speaker at the Peking banquet was NLHS vice
 chairman Kaysone Phomvihan, in Peking after participating in
 * On 17 April, however, NCNA reported the recollection of
 this formulation by DPRK Foreign Minister Ho Tam at the North
 Korean Supreme People's Assembly session.  The DPRK ambassador
 at the Peking banquet had also echoed Ho Tam at the Assembly
 session in stressing Asian unity.  See the 21 April TRENDS,

 the CPSU congrebv in Moscow.*  He routinely thanked the Chinese
 for their "tremendous and valuable support and assistance,"
 calling them the "staunch rear area of the Indochinese people."
 He departed from the usual theme of mutual support and
 assistance among the Indochinese people to single ri't for
 praise North Vietnam's aid to the other Indochinese.  He said
 that "North Vietnam has not only become the staunch rear
 area of South Vietnam, but also has given all-out support
 and assistance to the struggle in Laos and Cambodia."  This
 statement is consistent with NLHS expressions of gratitude
 to the DRV for its "support and assistance" to the Lao battle-
 fronts in the wake of the Highway 9 battles.  The usual Hanoi
 practice, however, is to limit itself to assertions that
 it fights "shoulder to shoulder" with the Laotian and
 Cambodian people, renders them "support," or fulfills its
 "international obligations" to them.
 MOSCOW    Moscow gave the anniversary minimal attention, in
 keeping with its cautious stance regarding Sihanouk
 and the fact that the summit conference was sponsored by
 Peking.  (The PRC, DPRK, and Albania had greeted the conference
 last year with government statements, but Moscow had given it
 only routine-level attention.)  TASS briefly reported the
 meeting in Hanoi and an address on the anniversary by Nguyen
 Huu Tho to the people of South Vietnam, but apparently did
 not mention the Peking banquet.
 PRAVDA commentator Mayevsk'.y, in an article scoring the U.S.
 refusal to withdraw its troops, summarized by TASS on the 27th,
 briefly mentioned the anniversary in passing.  He said that
 the conference marked a "new stage" in the struggle of the
 peoples of Indochina, adding that the "anti-imperialist front
 of the peoples of Indochina" plays a "paramount part" in rallying
 the patriotic forces and has achieved "remarkable success" in
 repelling the enemy.

 the PRG at the CPSU congress, is also at the Bulgarian congress.

 HANOI SCORES U1K, COCHAIRMANIS CHARGE OF DRV INVASION OF LAOS
 On 23 April the Hanoi domestic service carries a commentary
 castigating the British Government for circulating on 21 April
 a note to the signatories of the 1962 Geneva agreement "slander-
 ously accusing the ARV of reputedly encroaching upon Laos'
 neutrality and violating the 1962 Geneva agreements on Laos."
 It scores the British Government for having approved of the
 U.S.-supported Saigon operation in Laos and having "slandered"
 the DRV for "invading" Laos.  The commentary does not acknowledge
 that the British note id's ,covering memo to a Souv nna
 Phouma 1 April letter to the Soviet and British Geneva
 Conference cochairmen, the British having decided to circulate
 the  letter  unilaterally after having failed to enlist Soviet
 cooperation.*  Soviet media have not mentioned the Souvanna
 Phouma letter and the British response, in accordance with
 their usual silence on such exchanges.  On at least one occasion
 in the past, however, in August 1969, Moscow did belatedly note
 a June Souvanna Phouma letter in a routine-level Lao-language
 broadcast.
 Although the Hanoi commentary does not mention Souvanna Phouma's
 current letter, it does recall that on it March the British
 circulated a 5 February letter from Souvanna Phouma to the
 Geneva cochairmen which contained "slanderous accusations"
 against the DRV, and notes that the NLHS had protested that
 Br=tish move with a central committee spokesman's statement.**
 Since mid-1969 Hanoi media have apparently ignored the various
 letters from Souvanna Phouma to the Geneva cochairmen and
 Britain's unilateral circulation of them.  Prior to that,
 however, in 1968 and early 1969, Hanoi had responded with
 NHAX DAN article6 and on one occasion, 22 March 1969, issued
 *   Souvanna Phouma's letter focused on charges that DRV
 troops attac;.ad the outskirts of Luang Prabang on 21 March.
 Although it acknowledges that U.S.-supported Saigon troops
 entered Laos on 8 February and that on the same day the RLG
 condemned all foreign forces using Lao territory, the letter
 states that the incident would not have occurred had North
 Vietnamese forces not been present in Lao territory.

 a DRV Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement denouncing a letter
 from the "Vientiane authorities" to the Geneva cochairmen.
 The Radio of the Patriotic Neutralist Forces and the Pathet Lao
 news agency carry commentaries on 25 and 28 April castigating
 the current British message and noting that Souvanna Phouma
 had sent a letter to the British, but not acknowledging that
 the letter was sent to the Soviet Geneva cochairman as well.
 Normally the NLHS responds to the British circulation of
 Souvanna Phouma's letters with a central committee spokesman's

 FIFTH CONGRESS OF HANOI VIETNAM WORKERS PARTY HELD
 DRV media have reported the convening of the fifth congress of
 party organizations in the Hanoi area.  The Hanoi newspaper
 HANOI MOI in early April had reported that a municipal
 party conference, held 10-13 March, hac' taken the decision to
 hold the fifth congress in the latter half of April.
 VNA on the 23d, r'_porting the congress, noted that a report
 by Nguyen Van Tran, secretary of the Hanoi committee and member
 of the VWP Secretariat, reviewed "achievements recorded over
 the past three years."  It noted also that the congress dealt
 with Hanoi's future tasks from 1971-73.  The only othei available
 propaganda on the congress is a 26 April Hanoi domestic broadcast
 which said that the congress "was extremely elated" in welcoming
 Premier Pham Van Dong, who spoke. According to the radio, Dong
 hailed the anti-U.S. national salvation resistance and spelled
 out the tasks of the North--to provide support for the frontline,
 stand ready to fight, and strengthen the North in all fields.
 The radio added that he hailed Hanoi's determination to carry
 out its share of the tasks.,  HANOI MOI had indicated that the
 municipal party executive committee would be reelected at the
 congress, but there is no mention of this in either the VNA or
 Hanoi radio reports.
 The fourth Hanoi congress was held in April 1968 and was
 addressed by Party First Secretary Le Duan.  The fourth congress
 of party chapter delegates reportedly reviewed "the leadership
 over tasks during the past four years and set forth new trends
 and tasks for coming years."  Nguyen Van Tran read a political
 report.  A 17 April 1968 radio report of that congress noted that
 the previous third Hanoi congress was held in July 1963.

 SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS
 MOSCOW ASSAILS MAOIST POLICIESi ILICHEV RETURNS TO PEKING
 In Moscow's first substantial reaction to recent Sino-U.S. devel-
 opments, the weekly NEW TIMES has accused Peking of easily
 betraying its friends and of persisting in efforts to obstruct
 the relaxation of tansions across a wide range of international
 issues.  The thrust of the NEW TIMES comment is that Peking's
 recent moves do not indicate a change in its basic line of seek-
 ing world power in order io pursue nationalistic aims at other
 countries' expense.
 Soviet concern over the impact of "ping-pong diplomacy" has sur-
 faced in the Moscow domestic radio's weekly roundtable discussion
 program, a forum for airing cuxrent international topics for the
 home audience.  On 25 April panelists discoursed at length on
 suggestions that Sino-U.S. developments may have adverse implica-
 tions for Soviet interests and for the Indochinese communists.
 In a sign of Soviet irritation, both NEW TIMES and the roundtable
 panelists referred to the Chinese leaders as "the Maoists" rather
 than by a neutral term.  This usage also accords with Moscow's
 line that Chinese policy has not really moderated or departed from
 radical goals commonly associated with Maoism.
 While showing its displeasure, Moscow has demonstrated restraint
 in responding to Peking's recent moves.  There has still been no
 direct comment in the Soviet central press on the recent events
 in Sino-U.S. relations, nor has there been an authoritative response
 to Peking's major ideological pronouncement on the centenary of the
 Paris Commune on 18 March.  (Moscow took just less than four weeks
 to reply in kind to Peking's authoritative statement on Lenin's
 centenary last spring.)  In the major Soviet address on Lenin Day
 this year, CPSU Secretary Katushev on 22 April limited his anti-
 Peking remarks to a slap at "petit-bourgeois and pseudorevolutionary
 ideas" without naming the Chinese.
 BORDER TALKS     At the same time, Moscow has called attention to
 the Sino-Soviet border talks, as if to signal its
 intent to attain progress in the negotiations amid speculation
 that the Soviet position is adversely affected by improved relations
 between the other two sides in the triangular relationship.  TASS
 reported on 19 April that L.F. Ilichev, the chief Soviet negotiator
 at the talks, and Soviet Ambassador Tolstikov had returned to Peking

 that day after having attended the CPSU congress.      Reversing the
 order in which Moscow had given the two Soviet officials' names
 when reporting their meeting with Chou En-lai on 21 March, before
 they had gone to Moscow, TABS listed Ilichev ahead of Tolstikov.*
 TASS identified the talks as concerning a "settlement of border
 questions," a formulation Brezhnev had used in his report to the
 congress on 30 March.  Moscow has referred to the talks in various
 ways, sometimes specifying that they concern a border settlement
 (earlier examples were speeches by Kosygin and Podgornyy last
 June) and at other times noting more broadly that they deal with
 unspecified topics concerning bilateral relations.  Moscow's
 original announcement on the agreement to open talks said they
 would deal with questions "in which both sides are interested,"
 and Brezhnev on 27 October 1969--a week after the opening of the
 talks--declared Soviet readiness to settle "border and other
 questions."
 The TASS report on Ilichev's return could indicate that he has been
 given fre3h instructions for making progress in the border negotia-
 tions, though it may simply reflect a judgment that with results
 obtained on other issues--notably the resumption of ambassadorial
 relations and improved trade relations--the focus should now be on
 the border question.  At any rate, the identification of the talks
 as concerning a border settlement accords with the way the Chinese
 have consistently defined the subject of the negotiations from the
 very beginning.
 The TASS report noted that the Soviet officials were met at the
 airport by the chief and deputy chief of the PRC delegation to
 the talks, Chiao'Kuan-hua and Chai Cheng-wen.  The two Chinese
 were also reported by Moscow on 23 April to have attended a film
 show at the Soviet embassy commemorating Lenin's birthday.  Revert-
 ing to its practice during the late 1960's, Peking this year ignored
 Lenin Day, apart from opening radio broadcasts on that day with a
 quotation from Lenin rather than from Mao.
 Peking reported neither the return of Ilichev and Tolstikov nor
 the Soviet embassy film show, just as it had failed to report the
 21 March meeting of the two Soviet officials with Chou.  Peking's
 failure to match Moscow's efforts to portray Sino-Soviet state
 relations as proceeding normally was thrown in sharp relief by

 but the latter as a deputy foreign minister is superior to the
 ambassador.

 NCNA's report on an 18 April PRC Foreign Ministry note "expressing
 indignation" over a collision between a Soviet ship and a Chinese
 fishing boat in the Tonkin Gulf.  Moscow had sought to head off
 trouble over the accident by a prompt TASS announcement on 31 March--
 less than 24 hours after the collision--that the Soviet Government
 had expressed "deep regrets" over the accident.  The TASS effort
 was denounced by NCNA as "a sheer distortion."
 NEW TIMES ARTICLE SAYS CHINESE "EASILY BETRAY FRIENDS"
 The NEW TIMES article on "Peking's Diplomatic Game," published in
 issue No. 17 over the signature of L. Kirichenko, follows familiar
 polemical lines in seeking to isolate Peking as an outlaw among
 responsible members of the family of nations despite recent Chinese
 diplomatic moves.  Available thus far only in summary, the article
 also seems to play on North Vietnamese and North Korean concern
 over Chinese gestures toward the United States.  This aspect was
 highlighted by a 21 April TASS summary which began by quoting the
 article's charge that "the political practices of the Maoists show
 that they easily betray friends and quickly come to terms with
 those whom they just called enemies" if "they consider it necessary
 to meet the great-power nationalistic interests" of Peking.  Apart
 from the TASS summary, versions of the article have been hears only
 in broadcasts to Asia in French and English over Radio Peace and
 Progress.
 Judging from the NEW TIMES article, Moscow has come up with no new
 approach to the challenge posed by Peking's more flexible p;li~'ies
 and has fallen back on old rind tried themes depicting the PRC as
 a disruptive force in the international community.  The article
 grudgingly acknowledges "some new aspects in Peking's recent moves,"
 but it stresses that Peking's unchanged basic strategy continues to
 be directed toward achieving world power in order to impose its
 will on other states in "the traditional spirit of sinocentrism."
 This wa- the line Moscow took in its effort to isolate Peking during
 the period of heightened Sino-Soviet border tensions.
 SINO-U.S.      Though the article takes the Chinese to task on a wide
 RELATIONS      variety of issues, its timing was clearly occasioned
 by recent Sino-U.S. developments--a subject that had
 been discussed in an earlier NEW TIMES article (in issue No. 13,
 dated 26 March) anticipating further developments in "the diplomacy
 of eaiiles" between Washington and Peking.  NEW TIMES, a foreign-
 affairs weekly published in several languages, frequently conveys

 Soviet views on international issues on which the principal Moscow
 press is avoiding direct comment.
 The Kirichenko article seeks to disparage the recent Sino-U.S.
 developments, noting; that Washington has rewarded Peking's "con-
 ciliatory gestures" with only "minor steps" and that the United
 States "does not i.itend to liquidate its bases on Taiwan and to
 return the island to China."  As for China's representation in
 the United Nations, the article scornfully observes:  "Well,
 Washington is prepared, as a present to Peking, to offer the
 latter . . . the two-Chinas combination" (TASS' ellipses).
 As in other Soviet reaction to the visit of American table tennis
 players and corre pondents to China, the article brings up the
 question of strategic implications of "this fact of minor impor-
 tance" for the future of Southeast Asia and the Far East.  It cites
 Western commentators as analyzing this event against the general
 background of developments in those areas and as making "far-
 reaching conclusiors."  However, the TASS summary does not discuss
 Indochina.
 SOVIET-U.S.     A significant dimension of Soviet concern over the
 RELATIONS       impact of Chinese diplomatic moves shows through in
 the NEW TIMES article's attempt to depict Peking as
 an obstructionist element in efforts to settle international con-
 flicts.  Statisig that the Chinese oppose any measures which could
 contribute to "a real relaxation" of tension, the article in effect
 reminds the United States that it has a greater stake in cooperating
 with the Soviet Union in the interests of international stability
 than in seeking to gain leverage by improving relations with the
 PRC.  Thus, the article points out that Peking opposes the Soviet-FRG
 trer_y and objects to any move toward a Middle East settlement.  It
 also takes note of Peking's campaign against the two superpowers in
 the name of smail and medium-size nations, which "reveals clearly a
 desire to make China the principal superpower of the world."  In
 short, the article reflects Soviet concern that Peking's more flexi-
 ble maneuverings will complicate Moscow's owi, diplomatic objectivc;3
 while enhancing Chinese influence.
 In seeking to depict the PRC as a menace to international security,
 the article takes a familiar polemica: tack in imputing to Peking
 a wish to trigger an armed class betwee. the Soviet Union and the
 United States.  This charge has long figured in Moscow's effort to
 discredit Chinese motives in the international arena, particularly
 in connection with arms control issues.  The TASS summary does not,
 however, mention arms control as one of the subjects on which the
 Chinese have takes: a negative stand.

 THIRD WORLD     Following still another familiar line, the article
 seeks to play on fears of Chinese influence among
 the independent states of the third world.  It charges that "the
 Maoists continue to meddle with the affairs of India and Burma,
 Pakistan and Ceylon, the Arab states and several countries of Africa."
 Moscow's special interast in India is reflected in the article's
 claim that one Chinese aim is "to encircle India by states which
 would follow in the wake of Peking's policy."
 SOCIALIST       Soviet concern over Peking's East European policy
 COMMUNITY       is registered in a passage accusing the Chinese of
 intensifying their attempts to "undermine the social-
 ist community'! in pursuit of their "great-power, hegemonic line."
 With the growing Sino-Romanian ties evidently in mind, the article
 argues that the Chinese seek to isolate other communist countries in
 order to impose Peking's political line on them one by one--an implied
 warning to Romania that it could become another Albania.
 Moscow's allies--except for Bucharest--have weighed in with comment
 supporting the Soviets and probing anti-Soviet implications of recent
 Sino-U.S. developments.  In one commentary, the Polish ZYCIE WARSZAWY
 on 28 April spelled out some of the sensitive issues underlying
 Moscow's concern over the impact these developments could have on
 its bargaining position.  Stating that there would be no cause for
 concern over an improvement in Sino-U.S. relations were it not for
 a desire by both Peking and Washington to strengthen their hands
 against the Soviets, the article observes that the Sino-Soviet talks
 are at "a complete deadlock" and that Washington has not shown any
 readiness to meet Moscow halfway at the strategic arms limitation
 talks or in the talks on Berlin.

 CEYLON
 MOSCOW REPORTS "ULTRALEFTIST" REBELLION; PEKING REMAINS SILENT
 While Peking media maintain total silence on the armed insurgency
 which broke out in Ceylon on 5 April, Moscow has reported the
 government moves against the rebels and has identified them--in
 a broadcast for Chinese listeners in Southeast Asia--as "ultra-
 leftist terrorists" who profess socialist objectives but are in
 fact supported by "reactionaries."  They are directly identified
 as "Maoist" in the Hungarian party daily, quoting the chairman
 of the pro-Soviet Ceylon Communist Party.  But there has been no
 comment in the Soviet central press, and in most of its radio
 comment Moscow has obscured the causes and nature of the
 insurgency.  It has nowhere alluded to the USSR's supply of
 military aid to the Ceylon Government in response to the latter's
 request.
 Pyongyang acknowledged the insurgency obliquely on 20 April in
 officially protesting the Ceylon Government's expulsion of the
 DPRK embassy staff, complaining that the action was based on
 "fabricated" charges linking the DPRK to the "domestic unrest"
 in Ceylon.  Pyongyang's protest coincided with Peking publicity
 for a Ceylon Government statement refuting "malicious rumors"
 (vaguely defined) about Chinese activities in Ceylon.
 Havana media, publicizing'the visit of Ceylon Prime Minister
 Sirimavo Bandaranaike's son to Cuba, have taken only the
 briefest notice of the insurgency.
 MOSCOW     During the first two weeks of the insurgency Soviet
 media confined their coverage to scattered brief
 reports on the "resolute measures" taken by the Ceylon Government
 to restore order and to put down what were described as "rebels"
 organized by "reactionary forces" seeking to overthrow
 Mrs. Bandaranaike's United Front Government.  There was no
 allusion to the insurgency in a Moscow commentary in English
 to Southeast Asia on the 17th expressing the Soviet people's
 "full understanding and support" for the "progressive course"
 of the Ceylon Government during its first 10 months in office;
 the commentary was pegged to Brezhnev's CPSU congress remarks
 grouping Ceylon with Afro-Asian countries following a
 noncapitalist path.

 It was in a broadcast in Mandarin to Southeast ksia on the
 18th that Moscow media elaborated on the nature of the
 insurgency and explained who the rebels are.         The broadcast
 said the Ceylon Government had uncovered many "secret arms
 caches" and a "plot" by "ultraleftist terrorists and
 reactionary forces to 1aunrl. large-scale attacks on govern-
 ment organs, to create confusion by staging a revolution,
 and to overthrow the legitimate government by means of
 armed violence."  Identifying the insurgents as belonging
 to "the People's Liberation Organization," which is "mainly
 composed of young students and unemployed secondary school
 and university students," the commentary asserted that
 although the organization "terms itself socialist," it is
 "pursuing objectives that have nothing in common with
 genuine socialism"; and although it "proclaims itself a
 leftist progressive organization," it has "resorted to
 terrorism."  The commentary charged that in addition to
 receiving support from "Ceylon's reactionaries," the
 insurgents had been funded by "Western espionage organizations,
 including the CIA."
 Subsequent Moscow radio commentaries in other languages have
 refrained from elaborating on the causes or nature of the
 insurgency, and the characterization of the rebels as
 "ultraleftists" has not recurred.  Brief news reports on
 continuing Ceylon Government efforts to "liquidate pockets
 of resistance" portray the insurgents as "ter.-?orists backed
 by the reaction."
 BUDAPEST,     The Soviet line that reactionary forces are
 WARSAW        behind the rebellion has been echoed in East
 European media.  In an interview reported by
 Budapest's NEPSZABADSAG on 20 April, Ceylon Communist Party
 Chairman Dr. S.A. Wickremasinghe contended that "rightist
 groups opposing the implementation of a progressive-program
 and nationalizatica" are behind the "antigovernment uprising"
 in Ceylon.  He stated that the rightist groups had been
 assisted by the unemployed, well-educated young people, and
 "Maoist groups of the workers movement, which were also
 supported from abroad."  By implication, he also sought to
 include the U.S. embassy and the opposition United National
 Party, ousted by Mrs. Bandaranaike's United Front in May 1970,
 among the conspirators.

 Playing a similar theme, an article in the Warsaw daily
 SZTANDAR MLODYCH, reported by PAP on 16 April, charged
 "the Ceylonese reaction" with "creating appearances of
 attacks launched by the pseudo-leftwing circles" in order
 to "provoke tension and create political and economic
 confusion, setting Premier Bandaranaike at variance with
 the leftwing forces which support her."
 PEKING     Silent on the insurgency, NCNA reported on
 19 April that the PRC ambassador to Ceylon had
 been received by Prime Minister Bandaranaike and, with no
 linking of the two events, noted on the 20th that the Ceylon
 Government had issued a communique "refuting malicious
 rumors aimed at disrupting Ceylon-China relations."  The
 communique sought to discredit rumors circulating in Ceylon
 about Chinese technicians working on the PRC-supported
 construction of the Bandaranaike memorial international
 conference hall in Colombo and about "materials" being
 brought in from China for the project.  NCNA did not
 elaborate on the substance of the rumors, which apparently
 included speculation that materiel for the insurgents was
 being brought in along with the construction materials.
 PYONGYANG     The DPRK Foreign Ministry on 20 April issued
 a statement contending that "unfriendly action"
 by the Ceylon Government had made it impossible for the
 DPRK embassy staff "to perform their functionu as a diplomatic
 mission in Ceylon" and that the staff "had no altern:utive but
 to leave the country on 16 April."  Alleging that the
 expulsion of the embassy staff "stemmed fron the sinister and
 sly scheme of imperialists" and reactionaries to wreck
 Ceylon-Korean relations, the statement asserted that the
 expulsion was taken "without any reason or foundation
 whatsoever," that it was based on "fabricated facts" which
 scught to link "the domestic state of unrest" in Ceylon with
 the DPRK, and that it was part of "a wicked plot to mislead
 public opinion and slander the DPRK."  The statement predicted
 that the "sinister scheme" will be "shattered" and that
 Korean-Ceylon relations "will be normalized again in the
 interests of the peoples of the two countries."

 The nature of the insurgent groups was not defined:  neither

 reported in the Western press.
 On 1.1 April Cuban media reported the arrival in Havana of
 Mrs. Bandaranaike's son Anura, and on the 16th he was
 reported to be taking part in cane-cutting activities.

 PAKISTAN
 Apparently judging that the rebellion in East Pakistan is winding
 down and that Soviet interests lie in good relations with Pakistan
 President Yahya Khan's government, Moscow confines its now infre-
 quent coverage of the situation to reports attributed to Pakistani
 sources portraying a return to normalcy in the rebellious region
 and a complete rout of the secessionist forces.   Previously,
 Moscow had balanced reports on events from the Pakistan Government's
 standpoint with Western news accounts depicting widespread afted
 opposition to the Pakistan military forces attrMpting to restore
 control in the Eastern region.
 Peking has sustained its silence on what it       Pakistan's
 internal affairs while focusing on alleged i,     arence by India
 abetted by the two "superpowers."*
 MOSCOW PUBLICIZES OFFICIAL PAKISTAN GOVERIW`4ENT LINE
 After having stated its concern over events in East Pakistan in
 President Podgornyy's 3 April message to Yahya and then retreating
 to an essentially neutral stance, Moscow now associates itself with
 the Pakistan Government's line that the rebellion has been brought
 to heel.  Thus, TASS on 19 April noted a Pakistan press agency
 report that "the last major town controlled by the supporters of
 Mujibur Rahman" had fallen to the Pakistan Army, and it cited a
 Dacca radio report on the restoration of public transportation
 and the improving availability of foodstuffs in East Pakistan.  On
 22 April TASS quoted "official reports from Dacca" as saying that
 "life is gradually returning to normal in the cities and towns of
 East Pakistan."  On the 27th TASS cited a Pakistan Radio announce-
 ment  that "mopping-up operations" were being conducted against
 secessionist units in various areas of the Eastern wing, and it
 took note of other claims that normalcy had been restored.
 The considerations underlying Moscow's approach were reflected in
 a 15 April commentary in English to South Asia which was particularly
 defensive regarding Pakistani press reaction to the Soviet position
 on the Pakistan crisis and to Podgornyy's message to Yahya.  This
 commentary, the only elaboration of Podgornyy's message in Soviet
 media, reiterated what it said was "the essence of the Soviet

 message" and. stressed that the Soviet interest was simply in
 ending the bloodshed and encouraging a peaceful :iolutic.n.  It
 emphasized that "the public in many other Asian countrie.j
 friendly to Pakistan share the [Soviet] alarm and concern about
 the events in that country."  Soviet media never acknowledged
 Yahya's reply to Podgornyy's message.
 Soviet media have also ignored Pakistani appeals--repeated by
 Peking--for Moscow to urge India to cease its alleged inter-
 ference in Pakistan's affairs.  Moscow's first public
 acknowledgment of Indian-Pakistani tension appeared in a
 TASS transmission on 28 April which, in a studied show of
 neutrality, juxtaposed Pakistani and Indian accounts of
 border trouble.  A Karachi-datelined report quoted a Dacca
 radio announcement that two soldiers from an Indian frontier
 battalion had been taken prisoner during Pakistani operations
 against infiltrators, while a Delhi-datelined report cited an
 Indian news agency as saying Pakistani Government troops have
 repeatedly crossed the border and fired on Indian border posts.
 Moscow's suspicions regarding Chinese interests in the area
 were conveyed in a NEW TIMES article, reviewed by TASS on
 21 April, which stated that "the Maoists continue to meddle
 with the affairs of India and Burma, Pakistan and Ceylon" and
 seek "to encircle India by states which would follow in the
 wake of Peking's policy."*
 PEKING CONTINUES TO DECRY INDIAN, "SUPERPOWER" INTERFERENCE
 Peking has continued to focus its propaganda on alleged inter-
 ference in Pakistan's internal affairs by the "Indian
 reactionaries, Soviet revisionism, and U.S. imperialism"
 while avoiding comment on the secessionist movement and the
 fighting in East Pakistan.  PRC media have not acknowledged
 messages of support to Yahya from Chou En-lai (reported by
 both Pakistani and Indian news sources) and from Mao Tse-tung
 (reported by Indian sources).  Peking has publicized material
 from Australian communist, Albanian, and Congolese organs to
 condemn the Indian Government, the United Nations, the Soviet
 Union, and the United States for interference in Pakistan
 events.  In addition, Peking has continued to publicize

 Pakistan protests to the Indian Government alleging armed
 activities against Pakistan forces.
 NCNA on 18 April, in what seems a glaring oversight by its
 editors, carried a Rawalpindi-datelined report on East
 Pakistan protests against Indian interference which included
 a quotation from a Karachi paper that should have brought a
 blush to the editors' cheeks:
 On more than one occasion Indian Prime Minister
 Indira Gandhi had publicly stated that India could
 could not sit idle--a notorious euphemism for
 military action interminably used by would-be
 aggressors.
 Also on 18 April, NCNA reported a banquet in Peking in honor
 of Pakistan Air Force Commodore Kamal Ahmad, commandant of
 the staff college of the Pakistan Air Force, and an accompany-
 ing group of instructors and cadets.  It took note of toasts
 "to the constant consolidation and growth of the friendship
 between the peoples, the armies and the air forces of China
 and Pakistan."

 MIDDLE EAST
 USSR NOTES ROGERS' MIDEAST TOUR1 REJECTS ISRAEL'S SUEZ IDEAS
 Moscow dismisses the 23 April announcement of Secretary Rogers'
 forthcoming Middle East tour as a maneuver aimed at white-
 washing U.S. policy and asserts that no diplomatic strategems
 can force the Arabs to abandon their just demands.  Propagandists
 focus on portraying the United States as too aligned with
 Israel to be objective, and depict Israel as trying to
 substitute U.S. mediation for that of Jarring.  But TASS made
 no mention of the Secretary's trip in reporting the continued
 suspension of Jarring's mission, announced on the 23d,
 linking It only with Israeli efforts to "wreck" a Middle
 East peace settlement.
 At the same time, Moscow continues to press a Big Four role,
 calling attention to world expectations that the four-power
 consultations will produce some realistic effort for peace,
 and charging the United States with cynicism and obstructionism
 in its attitude to the talks.
 The propaganda claims that Israel desires some purely American
 rather than international and UN guarantees to accompany the
 reopening of the Suez Canal.  Moscow terms as unacceptable
 the reported Israeli ideas on reopening the canal, describing
 them as aimed only at retention of the occupied territories.
 ROGERS'    Reporting Secretary Rogers' 23 April press conference
 TOUR       at which he announced his forthcoming visits to the
 UAR, Lebanon, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Israel, TASS
 singled out his statement of continued U.S. support for Security
 Council Resolution 242 and for the Jarring mission.  In this
 connection, TASS said, the Secretary stated that his tour
 aimed at supplementing, rather than substituting for, the
 Jarring mission.  Washington's deeds, TASS asserted, contradict
 Rogers' statement, and it pointed to U.S. military and
 political aid to Israel and charged the United States with
 obstructing Big Four consultations by proposing that the
 four powers "not 'impose peace on the Middle East.'"  The
 role of the Big Four is also underlined by other propagandists,
 Kolesnichenko in PRAVDA on the 23d quoting Ambassador Bush
 as stating, in an interview for an Israeli radio audience,
 that the United States views the four-power consultations

 TABS and Moscow broadcasts in Arab:I.c have quoted comment from
 the Cairo papers AL-AKFIBA.R and AL-JUMHURIYA.II criticizing U.S.
 policy', the former saying Secretary Rogers' visit could be
 useful only if it aimed at honest observance of Resolution
 242, and the latter claiming that the purpose of the tour is
 to strengthen American interests.  An Arabic-language broadcast
 on the 27th described Arab press reaction to the Rogers trip as
 further affirmation of the UAR's "constructive stand" in
 desiring to solve the crisis peacefully.  While describing
 the trip as a new maneuver of U.S. diplomacy, it added, the
 Arabs "are not rejecting the possibility of expressing their
 views once again" on the question of establishing a durable
 and just peace.
 ISRAEL'S SUEZ    Israel's ideas on a partial settlement relating
 PROPOSALS        to reopening the Suez Canal, discussed by
 Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Alon and
 Secretary Rogers on the 20th, were promptly branded by TABS
 on the 21st as testimony to "further sabotage" by Israel of
 UAR efforts to settle the crisis and reopen the canal.
 Israel's proposals are regarded in Cairo, according to a
 foreign-language commentary on the 26th, as u,imedat
 perpetuating the occupation by attempting to isolate the
 problem of the canal reopening from a general settlement.
 Primakov, in the domestic service commentators' roundtable
 on the 25th, summed up the essence of the "so-called
 proposals":  Israel is "supposedly ready" to partially
 withdraw its troops 10 miles, "beyond the range of medium-
 caliber Egyptian artillery," on condition that Egypt end
 the state of war with Israel and no Egyptian soldiers cross
 the canal.  In other words, Primakov said, Israel demands
 legalization of the occupation, and he viewed the proposals
 as completely unacceptable.  In recalling President as-Sadat's
 initial proposal, on 4 February, for reopening the canal,
 Primakov noted that the question of distance of withdrawal
 was not "definitely stated" and that it "therefore remains
 a subject of further discussion."  (In his NEWSWEEK article
 released on 15 February, however, as-Sadat had defined
 partial withdrawal to mean withdrawal to a line behind
 al-Arish--a point noted by Moscow at the time.)

 AMERICAN        Soviet commentators claim that Washington,
 "MEDIATION"     responding to Tel Aviv's appei.1, agreed to
 serve as an intermediary in the Suez Canal
 question, with Israel thus addressing its 1..dias to the United
 States and ignoring the Jarring mission.  Priraakov in his
 27 April commentary speculated as to whether the United
 States assumed the "so-called mediation mission" to substitute
 for the Jarring mission, or to ease world criticism of
 Israel by saying that mediation was still. going on, or to
 try to reestablish U.S. positions in the Arab countries.  A
 '1'soppi commentary broadcast in English to Africa on the
 22d asserted that Tel Aviv, relying for mediation not on
 Jarring but on the United States, seemed to think that
 Washington has some right to shape the course of Middle East
 developments.  Tsoppi cited the Egyptian weekly ROSE AL-YUSUF
 as commenting that the UAR would have nothing against a
 positive contribution to the Jarring mission, but was
 absolutely against Washington's attempt to act the part
 of sole benefactor of the two sides in the dispute.
 EGYPTIAN         On the 25th, TASS reported a UAR Foreign
 STATEMENTS       Ministry statement, pegged to the Rogers
 tour, as declaring that any questions
 relating to a partial Israeli withdrawal can be discussed
 only within the framework of an all-round settlement of
 the crisis envisaging, first of all, Israeli withdrawal
 from all occupied territories.  The statement stressed
 Cairo's hope, TASS said, that the mission Secretary Rogers
 intends to carry out "will correspond to the general stand
 of the UAR,"  TASS at the same time ci':ed AL-A1RAM as
 noting that the UAR Foreign Ministry was studying news
 agency reports that Washington supports a partial settlement
 based on limited Israeli withdrawal, and said the paper
 pointed out that the ministry was also studying calls
 from different world capitals to convene the Security
 Council or the UN General Assembly to discuss Israel's
 "negative stand."
 TASS the same day reported UAR Foreign Minister Riyad as
 declaring that any partial troop withdrawal is out of the
 question, and there can inly be full withdrawal, which
 "could be carried out in two stages but must be accompanied
 by international guarantees and Israel's written commitment
 to Jarring."

 HAITI
 MOSCOW. HAVANA BROADCASTS IN CREOLE URGE "PATRIOTS" TO REVOLT
 Following the death of Haitian President Dr. Francois Duvalier,
 announced on 22 April, Moscow and Havana have evoked a threat of
 U.S. intervention in behalf of the regime against "patriotic"
 opposition forces and have used their special radio services in
 Creole to call for a popular uprising against Duvalier's heirs.
 Havana has long used its broadcasts in Creole and Moscow the
 Creole service of its purportedly unofficial Radio Peace and
 Progress to excoriate Duvalier and openly promote revolution.
 INITIAL       Both Cuban and Soviet media briefly reported
 REACTION      Duvalier's death soon after it was officially
 announced in Haiti, and both promptly speculated
 on the possibility of U.S. military intervention.  TASS reports
 and a 23 April Radio Moscow broadcast in Portuguese to Brazil
 charged that Washington, "alarmed" by the possible consequences
 of Duvalier's death, was "undertaking threatening steps" aimed
 at giving "psychological comfort to the supporters of the late
 dictator and butcher of the Haitian people."  Such steps were
 said to include "a virtual sea b:..jckade of Haiti."  Moscow said
 the United States was preparing to intervene against "the
 Haitian people's progressive forces" on the pattern of the
 intervention in the Dominican Republic.  In a similar vein, a
 Havana domestic :Arvice commentary on the 22d noted speculation
 about "a new intervention by U.S. troops, as in 1915 when they
 invaded Haitian territory on the pretext of protecting foreign
 interests."
 0
 Such comment, however, has not been extensive from Radio Moscow
 or in the Havana radio's regular services, which have paid
 little attention to events in Haiti since the period immediately
 following Duvalier's death.
 BROADCASTS     Inflammatory Soviet and Cuban broadcasts in
 IN CREOLE      Creole, on the other hand, have fired a barrage
 of personal abuse at the late president's daughter
 Marie Denise--described by Havana as "the real power" in the new
 government--and at Jean Claude Duvalier, who has succeeded his
 father as president for life.  Broadcasts in both Creole services
 have called upon the Haitian people to institute revolutionary
 action, picturing the regime as unchanged by Duvalier's death and

 seeking to lend urgency to the call to arms by dramatizing
 the threat of foreign intervention.
 A Radio Peace and Progress commentary in Creole on the 24th
 cited the contention of the Central Committee of the Unified
 Party of Haitian Communists (PUCH) that the Haitian people
 must be "very vigilant not to allow foreign intervention"
 and must unite "so that the action against Duvalierists can
 be successfully initiated and be crowned with complete
 success."  In its greetings to the CPSU Central Committee
 on the occasion of the 24th CPSU Congress, carried by PRAVDA
 on 12 April, the Haitian party Central Committee had asserted
 that the struggle against the Duvalier regime "must be of
 the nature of a popular armed struggle for national liberation,
 opening the way for the building of socialism."
 Jean Claude and Marie Denise came in for particularly vituperative
 personal attack in a Radio Peace and Progress commentary in
 Creole on the 25th, which warned the "imperialists" and "the
 Duvalierist band of sons of bitches" to "prepare themselves for
 the rebellion of the people."  The broadcast said "things are
 getting tougher in Haiti now" and declared that "the battle
 is ready to begin in which the people will definitively cleanse
 the country of all the filth and grease from the Duvalier
 family."  It called on the people to be alert and appealed to
 "all the patriotic forces to unite, so that they can rise up
 together against Duvalierism and the Yankee imperialism that
 is supporting it."
 Havana broadcasts in Creole on the 23d and 24th said the
 Haitian people have many demands "that only a people's govern-
 ment can meet" and emphasized that the people "do not want a
 tyrant to replace a tyrant."  The commentary on the 23d called
 on Haitians to "mobilize on a patriotic, revolutionary base,"
 to "take the initiative, stand up for their rights," and
 "prepare our forces."  The commentary said:  "Our souls are
 united and ready to attack the neocolonial, pro-Yankee
 society and finally begin the revolution in Haiti."

 Citing the U.S. Navy's "vigilance over Haiti" since "the old
 tyrant died" and blaming the United States for all of
 "Duvalier's crimes, infamies, and murders," a Havana commentary
 in Creole on the 24th urged Haitians to "Join forces to destroy
 the social roots of Duvalierism--that is, to change the
 semicolonial regime into a national liberation regime, a
 revolutionary regime."  It added that only when that occurs will

 the U.S. Government "take its troops off alert status,
 because it will know--as. it knew with Cuba--that the Marines
 would not come to Haiti to have a nice time; that they would
 be stopped on Haiti's plains and in the mountains of a new
 Vietnam."
 BACKGROUND     Both the Soviet and Cuban radio services in
 Creole had for years been forecasting the
 imminent downfall of Duvalier in the face of an armed revolt.*
 Peace and Progress commentaries since the beginning of this
 year had been picturing increasing unrest under a "wave of
 terrorism," denouncing Duvalier's constitutional machinations
 to establish Jean Claude as his successor, and publicizing
 calls by the PUCH for the people to "overthrow the dictatorial,
 antipopular, greedy regime."  On 9 April a commentary in Creole
 carried a PUCH appeal to Haitians to "be alert" and prevent
 "Duvalier's heirs from coming to power."  A 13 Apr'.l commentary
 depicted "a major crisis" in Haiti and declared that "the
 struggle against Duvalier should be a people's armed struggle
 for national liberation and should open the path to the building
 of socialism."  It added that the.Haitian people "have the
 support of all the progressive forces in the world, and
 especially that of the Soviets." .
 Havana's Creole broadcasts have been in similar vein.  A
 typical commentary on 17 March called on "all patriots and
 revolutionaries in Haiti" to unite in the creation of "a move-
 ment for a second independence of our homeland, to change the
 social system and this rot, and to build with the courage and
 heroism of the people . . . another Haiti, another society
 `hat is anti-imperialist, democratic, independent, sovereign,
 and socalist."  On 13 April a Creole commentary characterized
 the Haitian revolutionary movement as "more enthusiastic, more
 vigorous, more dynamic, and more communist than ever" and
 concluded that "only a socialist revolution will enable Haiti
 to emerge from underdevelopment and from the conditions which
 now prevail."

 SPACE FLIGHTS
 SOVIET SPACE DOCKING HAILED AS STEP TOWARD ORBITING STATIONS
 Moscow propaganda hailing the two-day flight of Soyuz 10 and
 its br:Lef docking, on 24 April, with the unmanned Salyut craft
 lays stress on creation of orbital stations as a chief aim
 of the Soviet space program.  Writing for TASS on the 26th,
 a Soviet scientist observed, for example, that "we are or. the
 way to space stations and laboratories, which is to be done
 by combining automatic devices with man's operation aboard
 a spaceship."  In a similar vein, S'iyuz 10 commander Shatalov,
 at a 25 April press conference heLi by the crew of the ship
 in Karaganda, asserted that "we a-. *e contini'.ing to advance
 along the road of creating orbital research stations."
 An ?ZVESTIYA article on the 24th stcced that "one of the
 chief aims" of the Soyuz program is the assembling of
 orbiting stations to perform scientific tasks as well as
 to resolve problems in the national economy.  On the
 latter score, the IZVESTIYI'. article and other commentaries
 point up such benefits of space research as the discovery
 of mineral deposits and the accurate forecasting of
 weather.  Such stres:i on practical results--perhaps aimed
 at justifying the expenditures on space research--has been
 prominent in Moscow's comment on Soviet space activities
 since 1967.
 Available propaganda offers no explanation for the short
 duration of the linkup of the two craft and of the flight
 of Soyuz 10.  As in the past, Moscow's reporting conveys
 the impression that all went well.  Summing up the results
 of the flight at the 25 April press conference, Shatalov
 said that while it was short, it was complex in its work,
 aims, and tasks.  One of the most important tasks, according
 to the TASS account of Shatalov's remarks, was to try out
 the system of searching for and approaching an unmanned
 object in space and to test a new system of docking.  This
 line was echoed by cosmonaut Feoktstov, among others,
 in an interview with TASS on the 25th.  That some problems
 were met is implicit, however, in Feoktistov's observation
 that "it will become necessary in the future to learn to
 dock a relatively small transport spaceship with a huge
 multipurpose laboratory."  A docking of this type, he
 added, is a more difficult task than the docking of two
 Soyuz~or Cosmos spaceships--"craft of roughly the same

 Moscow has given no indication that the Salyut craft will
 serve as a docking target for other Soyuz flights.  But in
 line with statements in the media that experiments with
 the craft will be continued, the 26 April message of
 congratulations from the leading Soviet organs to those
 responsible for the flight of Soyuz 10 observed that
 research "which constitutes the beginning of work with
 Salyut" was carried out during the flight of the manned
 craft.
 DELAYED REPORT    Soviet coverage of the flight of the two
 OF DOCKING        crt'.ft stopped short of stating directly
 that a docking maneuver was scheduled--
 in keeping with past practice of withholding advance
 publicity for planned experiments on space flights.  But
 Moscow's reports had hinted strongly at the possibility.
 The TASS announcement of the 23 April launch of Soyuz 10
 stated that the orbital inclination was 51.6 degrees--
 the same figure given for the orbital inclination of
 Salyut in the TASS announcement of that launch on 19 April.
 The biographies of the three crew members of the Soyuz
 craft--released by TASS on the 23d--noted that two of them
 had flown in the craft involved in a docking maneuver in
 January 1969 and in the "group flight" of three ships in
 October 1969; the third member of the crew, according to
 TASS, had been trained as a test engineer of an orbital
 station.
 The announcement that a docking had taken place did not
 come until late on the 24th.  TASS on the 25th, reporting
 the safe landing of Soyuz 10 that day, stated that the
 docking had been accomplished at 0147 GMT on 24 April
 and lasted five and a half hours.  A TASS Russian dispatch
 at 1054 GMT on the 24th--after the docking had occurred
 but before it was announced--had said that during the
 joint flight scientific-technical experiments and
 operations "involved in docking and undocking of the
 manned spacecraft with the Salyut orbiting station were
 carried out."

 COSMONAUTICS DAY BRINGS STATEMENTS OF INTEREST IN COOPERATION
 Soviet spokesmen took the occasion of Cosmonautics Day, 12 April,
 to reaffirm Moscow's interest in cooperation with the United
 States in space.  But available Soviet propaganda on the
 flights of Soy:iz 10 and Salyut does not touch on this issue,*
 and Moscow media have not publicized. Soviet cosmonaut Maj.
 Gen. Beregovoy's remarks in Italy on a joint space venture.
 As reported by AFP on 26 April, Beregovoy said that space
 flights "with mixed Soviet-American crews would be possible
 in the future."  AFP quoted him as remarking that both
 countries have accumulated knowledge in a certain secto%- and
 that each would benefit if they pooled their experience.
 The avowals of a desire for cooperation on Cosmonautics
 Day had been couched in the usual broad generalities.  A
 letter from Soviet cosmonauts published in PRAVDA on
 12 April said that.in the interests of peace and friendship,
 "cooperation between space explorers of different countries,
 including the USSR and the USA, should develop and grow
 stronger."  In the same issue of PRAVDA, Academician Boris
 Petrov took note of the fact that agreement has been
 reached on the development of Soviet-U.S. cooperation
 "in certain directions of space research."  And Soviet
 Academy of Sciences President Keldysh, at a Kremlin
 meeting reported  in the domestic service on the 12th,
 said that the "first steps" have been made toward coopera-
 tion with the United States.  Petrov and Keldysh presumably
 alluded to the 21 January 1971 agreement between the
 Academy of Sciences and NASA to study a wide range of
 areas of cooperation, as well as to the 28 October 1970
 accord looking toward the development of compatible
 docking systems.
 The Central Committee report read by Erezhnev at the
 24th CPSU Congress on 30 March mentioned in passing the
 desirability of cooperating "with other interested states"
 in the conquest of space.
 *  While Moscow has long affirmed a Soviet interest in space
 cooperation with the United States, it has not often broached
 the subject in connection with the USSR's recent manned space
 flights.  For a report on the treatment of the flight of
 Soyuz 9 in June 1970, see the TRENDS of 15 July 1970, pages

 GERMANY AND BERLIN
 GDR REPORTS, MOSCOW SILENT ON ABRASIMOV REMARKS ON BERLIN
 East German but not Soviet media have publicized remarks by
 Abrasimov, the USSR ambassador to the GDR, on the Soviet
 draft proposals on West Berlin presented 26 March at the
 18th session of the four-power talks.  Abrasimov's comments--
 the most authoritative Soviet public discussion since the
 Polish press divulged details of the draft proposals on
 15 April--were made on the 23d in the course of a report
 on the CPSU congress at a meeting of the German-Soviet
 Friendship Society's Central Executive in East Berlin.
 The Moscow central preys, which has yet to acknowledge the
 existence of the Soviet draft proposals, did not even
 report that the meeting took place.  Moscow radio's domestic
 service took note of the meeting in a brief news item which
 did not mention that Abrasimov spoke.  But East Berlin media
 have given the meeting extensive coverage:  ADN reported
 the meeting and the content of Abrasimov's speech the same
 day, NEUES DEUTSCHLAND published the speech on the 24th,
 and East Berlin's Deutschlandsender broadcast a commentary
 on the speech and on the Soviet draft proposals on the
 26th.
 As quoted in NEUES DEUTSCHLAND, Abrasimov prefaced his
 references to the Soviet proposals with a recollection
 that the "peace" program outlined at the CPSU congress
 called for a European security conference, quick
 ratification of the Warsaw and Moscow treaties with Bonn,
 and "settlement of the problems involving West Berlin."
 Brezhnev, he said, "-_-learly stressed" to the congress
 "the Soviet Union's readiness to conclude the negotiations
 on the problems connected with West Berlin for the mutual
 benefit of all interested sides," provided the Big Three
 respect the allied agreements stipulating the "special
 status of West Berlin" and the "sovereign rights of the
 GDR as an independent socialist state."
 Declaring that the Soviet Union has made a "maximum" effort
 to demonstrate its desire for "mutually acceptable solutions"
 in the year-long four-power negotiations, the USSR ambassador
 went on to note -:;hat the Soviet side had "recently submitted
 an extensive and comprehensive draft of an agreement" on
 West Berlin which "offers every possibility of arriving at

 concerned.  "According to our deopent conviction and from
 the viewpoint of its practical significance," he naid, "this
 Soviet draft offers everything required to achieve an
 agreement in the near future."  But he added that because
 the negotiations are multilateral, "the good will of all
 sides and a striving to find an agreement not in words but
 in deeds" are essential.
 WARSAW PRESS CONTINUES DISCUSSION OF SOVIET DRAFT PROPOSALS
 Along with the GDR's publicity for Abrasimov's remarks,
 further Polish press comment on the Soviet draft proposals
 seems part of a well-orchestrated effort to convey via the
 media of Moscow's allies--while the Soviet central press
 stays silent--the impression that the USSR has made
 appreciable concessions at the four-power talks in the
 inte;-eats of a West Berlin settlement.
 In another in the succession of Polish press articles
 following up the disclosure of the Soviet proposals in
 a ZYCIE WARSZAWY editorial of the 15th,* a 23 April
 article in DZIENNIK LUDOWY reported--for the first time
 in monitored bloc media--Abrasimov's remark to the p_ess
 just after the 18th session of the four-power talks to
 the effect that "progress is possible."
 On 27 April, in his second major article in ZYCIE WARSZAWY
 in 10 days, Ryszard Wojna commented at length on the West
 Cerman reaction to the Soviet draft proposals.  Labeling
 the presentation of the Soviet proposals "a new fact of
 immense importance" and calling the proposals "the most
 far-reaching in the history of West Berlin," Wojna said
 that the Soviet Union submitted its draft at a time when
 the Brandt-Scheel government was pursuing a "realistic
 policy" despite strong internal political opposition.
 Deploring the CDU/CSU opposition to Brandt's Ostpolitik,
 and particularly to the Soviet proposals on West Berlin,
 Wojna added that some circles in Bonn believe that "in
 the face of definite Soviet concessions" the Federal
 Republic should "raise the price" of a settlement rather

 than matching Soviet "good will."  Wojna said the Soviet
 proposals had been offered in the same spirit of good will
 that had produced the signing of the Moscow treaty with
 Bonn, and he added pointedly that it was not the USSR that
 created the "linkage" between the ratification of the treaty

 FRG-CZECEIOSLOVAKIA
 PRAGUE RADIO REACTS TO WEST GERMAN C(*N NT ON BILATERAL TALKS
 A commentary in the West German weekly DE1i SPIEGEL of 12 April
 suggesting that the Czechoslovak side had been inade'uately
 prepared for the initial round of exploratory talks on normalizing
 FRG-Czechoslovak relations, held in Prague on 31 March and 1 April.,
 has prompted the first and only discussion of the talks in Prague
 media since they were held.  In the vein of Czechoslovak propaganda
 preceding the bilateral talks, a Prague radio commentary on 24 April
 rejoined that it had been at Czechoslovak initiative that the talks
 were finally begun after "long hesitation" on the part of Bonn.  The
 Czechoslovak Government had long been welling to hold the talks and
 had long been prepared for them, the broadcast said, while recogniz-
 ing that it would not be "easy to remove the obstacles that had
 accumulated" in relations between the two countries over the "past
 decades."
 After pointing out that the Bonn representative at the talks, State
 Secretary Frank, had praised the initial round for their "businesslike
 and frank atmosphere" and that West German media had for the most
 part treated them in a "serious" manner, the radio commentary went
 on to express concern over DER SPIEGEL's portrayal of a far less
 favorable West German reaction.  It cited passages in DER SPIEGEL
 quoting "alleged" statements by Frank "or other officials of the
 Bonn foreign ministry" to the effect that the Bonn negotiators
 "did not know at the end of the talks what they were actually in
 Prague for" and that the Czechoslovak side "had obviously not been
 properly prepared for the negotiations."  The officials indicated
 that Bonn welcomed this situation because it wants to "drag out
 the talks" in line with its general tactical approach to
 Czechoslovakia, the broadcast quoted DER SPIEGEL as reporting.
 If the weekly's allegations are true, the broadcast said, they
 would be in "crass contradiction" to Bonn's initial appraisal of
 the Prague talks as "encouraging."  And this, the radio added,
 could only "considerably shake the positive impression of the
 Bonn negotiators' seriousness" and their "professed interest in
 a positive outcome of the talks."
 Declaring that the West German Government should dissociate
 itself from the DER SPIEGEL commentary, the broadcast reported
 the Czechoslovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs as stating, in
 response to a question from Radio Prague, that Bonn has

 "otfieially dissociated itself through diplomatic channels
 from the alleged statementu" and considers such  peculation
 "harmful" to the next stage of the talks.  As If to leave
 the situatior still in some doubt, however, the broadcast
 added that if there has indeed been such a diplomatic
 demarche from Bonn it "should be considered a satisfactory
 explanation by the appropriate quarters in Prague."
 Scheduling of the second round of the exploratory talks for
 May in Born, reported by Federal Government spokesman Ahlers
 on 22 April, has yet to be mentioned in Prague media.

 BULGARIA
 PARTY CONGRESS REASSERTS ORTHODOX, PRO-SOVIET LINE
 The 10th Bulgarian Communist Party (BCP) Congress, which
 met from 20 to 25 April, reaffirmed a predictably orthodox
 pro-Soviet line and was about as unspectacular as the
 March CPSU congress from which it drew its guidelines.
 According to Bulgarian media, the congress "unanimously"
 elected Todor Zhivkov as party first secretary and
 reelected the entire 11-man Politburo.  It also expanded
 the Central Committee from 137 to 1147 members.  The only
 mild surprise was the ouster of Luchezar Avramov, who was
 not reelected as a candidate member of the Politburo.
 Avramov, the foreign trade minister, had been rumored for
 months to be in some difficulty because of an embezzlement
 scandal over a year ago in the Bulgarian Merchant Fleet
 enterprises which were doing business with the West.
 Venelin Kotsev, leading party ideologist, was elected
 to candidate membership in the Politburo in his place.
 The congress also dutifully ratified the new five-year
 plan directives and the new party program--a highly
 orthodo?, theoretical document that had already been
 published in the Bulgarian press on 14 March.
 In deference to Bulgaria as Moscow's most loyal ally,
 Brezhnev led the Soviet delegation to the congress.
 Hungary's Janos Kadar and Poland's Edward Gierek were
 the only East European party chiefs present.  The other
 bloc delegations were headed by East Germany's Erich
 Honecker, Politburo member and secretary of the
 Central Committee; Czechoslovakia's Alois Indra,
 Presidium member and secretary of the Central Committee;
 and Romania's Gheorghe Pana, Presidium and Executive
 Committee member and Central Committee secretary.  The
 Yugoslavs, whose relations with the Bulgarians continue
 to be strained over the perennial Macedonian issue, did
 not send a. delegation, but Radio Sofia reported that
 the Yugoslav ambassador attended the congress as an
 "observer."

 ;.?8 APR I:T, 1971,
 Peking has not been Beard to mention the congress, and 'T'irana
 has limited its coverage to a brief radio report on the 26th
 that the Bulgarian "revisionist party" had reelected Zh:Lvkov
 fir.ot st-cretary.
 ZHIVKOV    In his report to the opening session of the congress
 REPORT     on 20 April, as reported by B'2A and published in
 RABOTNICHESKO DELO, Zhivkov was typically effusive
 in his praise of the Soviet Union and relatively restrained
 in his criticism of China and the United States.  Following
 Brezhnev's lead at the Soviet congress, Zhivkov assailed the
 Chinese for attempts "to bring dissidence within our
 movement" but expressed Bulgarian willingness to "normalize"
 relations with Peking "regardless of serious ideological
 differences."  The BCP chief also followed Brezhnev's cue
 in asserting that Bulgaria had "fulfilled its international
 duty as an ally by rendering international assistance to
 the fraternal Czechoslovak people" in August 1968.
 Despite the Yugoslavs' failure to send an official delegation
 to the congress, Zhivkov was conciliatory toward Belgrade:
 He remarked that Sofia is "guided by the view that cooperation
 between the two socialist countries corresponds to the
 interests of our peoples" and promised that the Bulgarian
 Government would make "further efforts for the further
 consolidation of Bulgarian-Yugoslav good-neighborly
 relations."  Turning to another Balkan neighbor, he
 described the Albanian leaders as "sunk in the bog of
 opportunism and anti-Sovietism" but added that "in spite
 of this, Bulgaria is making and will further make sincere
 efforts to normalize relations among the Balkan states."
 In this vein Zhivkov asserted Bulgaria's readiness "to
 participate actively in all many-sided Balkan events that
 would lead to expanding economic, political, and cultural
 ties among the Balkan countries."  He went on to declare,
 in the broader context of European security, that Bulgaria
 was prepared to conclude "bilateral or regional treaties"
 on renunciation of the use or threat of force in inter-
 national relations--a point reiterated in Foreign Minister
 Bashev's speech to the congress on the 21st.*
 *  According to Western news sources, a proposal fora six-
 nation Balkan security conference was deleted from Zhivkov's
 congress report at the last minute; a Bulgarian. official was
 quoted as telling newsmen it had been decided that the .proposal
 would be inappropriate in a party forum and should come as a
 government initiative.

 Turning to relations with the West, Zhivkov limited himself
 to routine criticism of U.S. policies in Indochina and the
 Middle Eaot--later formalized in routine congress resolutions
 on both subjects--and played the coexistence theme while
 expressing an interest in further cooperation with the West
 "on the basis of mutual benefit."  On the domestic scene, with
 the lessons of the December riots and Gomulka'e ouster in
 the background, Zhivkov put c,,::siderable stress on the need
 to increase the Bulgarian people's standard of living.  In
 all spheres, he promised, "our efforts will aim at solving
 the main task:  to further raise the material and spiritual
 level of the life of the people."  In this connection, he
 promised an increase in the minimum wage and pensions as
 well as further efforts to improve housing and. maintain
 price stability.
 BREZi-WEV    There was little of note in Brezhnev's speech
 SPEECH       to the congress on 21 April--the first by a
 foreign delegate, relayed live from Sofia by
 Radio Moscow.  The Soviet leader did not repeat in Sofia
 his CPSU congress attack on the Chinese or defense of the
 intervention in Czechoslovakia, Zhivkov having echoed the
 Soviet position on both counts.  The main thrust of
 Brezhnev's speech was aimed at portraying Bulgaria as
 the epitome of a flourishing, contented ally in tune with
 its Soviet mentor.  After noting the similarity of focus
 and subject xr.atter at the CPSU and BCP congresses, Brezhnev
 added;  "In working to develop socialist economic
 integration, in defending socialist gains in the inter-
 national arena (read:  Czechoslovakia), in working out
 measures for further strengthening the Warsaw Treaty,
 the BCP has always acted and continues to act from
 the position of consistent socialist internationalism.
 For this we, friends and allies, pay the tribute of our
 deepest respect."
 In his closing address to the congress on the 25th,
 broadcast by Radio Sofia, Zhivkov once again assured
 his Soviet patrons that Bulgaria would be "unwavering"
 in its "awareness that it is necessary to subordinate
 without hesitation the private and temporary interests
 to the common and lasting interests of the world
 communist movement."

 USSR  INTERNAL AFFAIRS
 SON OF POLITBURO MEMBER SHELEST DEFENDS SELF IN PRESS
 In a move probably designed to fend off domestic criticism,
 the  on of Petr Shelest, Politburo member and Ukraine first
 secretary, has charged the New York TIMES with distorting
 his earlier proposals in regard to increased contacts with
 foreign scientists and altered priorities for Soviet science.
 In the 16 April 1971 LITERATURNA UKRAINA, Vitally P. Shelest,
 deputy director of the Kiev Institute of Theoretical Physics,
 and the editors of LITERATURNA UKRAINA assail the TIMES for
 allegedly falsifying and sensationalizing their pleas for
 more basic research and for freer contacts with foreign
 scientists.  But while renouncing the TIMES' interpretation,
 particularly the suggestion that their views are in dispute
 in the Soviet Union, Shelest and the editors reaffirm their
 positions and defend the public discussion of shortcomings
 in Soviet science.
 A year ago, in May 1970, Vitally Shelest initiated a 5-month
 debate on the problems of Soviet science in.LITERATURNA
 UKRAINA.  In the 5 May issue of this newspaper, he argued
 in behalf of a step-up in basic research as against applied
 research, and proposed establishment of an advanced studies
 center along the lines of that at Princeton.  In a PID
 PRAPOROM LENINIZMU article at about the same time, Shelest
 urged more contacts between Soviet and foreign scientists.
 Soviet scientists participating in the subsequent. public
 debate mostly approved of Shelest's proposals.  The author
 of an article in the 28 July issue of LITERATURNA UKRAINA
 went so far as to criticize the bureaucratic nature of
 security regulations that make it difficult for scientists
 to travel abroad or subscribe to foreign scientific
 publications.  On the other hand, a spokesman in the
 7 July issue of the Ukraine paper--economist G. M. Dobrov--
 accused Shelest of improperly setting basic science
 against applied science and of creating the impression
 that different branches of science are disputing among
 themselves.

 On 13 October, a LITERATURNA UKRAINA article by Yu. M. Dadenkov,
 Ukrainian Minister of Higher and Secondary Specialized Education,
 abruptly terminated the discussion.  Dadenkov concurred
 in the need for basic research and foreign contacts
 and in the proposal to set up new centers for advanced studies,
 but he stressed the importance of the faster returns from
 applied research and the primary need to.resolve global
 political issues that hinder collaboration among the world's
 scientists and technicians.
 A month later, on 8 November, writing in the New York TIMES,
 Prof. Harry Schwartz reported on Shelest's pleas for increased
 basic research and more opportunity for foreign contacts.
 Noting Shelest's dissatisfaction with Soviet scientific
 shortcomings, Schwartz recalled his suggestion that the
 USSR imitate Princeton's Institute for Advanced Studies.
 He suggested also that there is high-level Soviet
 opposition to Shele..`'s proposals.
 Now, 5 months later, Shelest and the editors of LITERATURNA
 UKRAINA are accusing Schwartz of exaggerating and twisting
 their ideas and of "seeking out crises and conflicts in our
 country."  Shelest claims Schwartz is making "attempts to
 create an atmosphere of unhealthy sensation" around his
 and the other LITERATURNA UKRAINA articles, trying to "present
 as a sensational innovation the fact of scientific collabora-
 tion between the USSR and foreign countries, which is steadily
 developing and which . . . is equally advantageous to both
 sides."  Shelest goes on to quote several letters from
 prominent foreign scientists urging expanded exchanges
 with his institute, and he concludes that "it is well known"
 that the "development of international scientific contacts
 is the unchanging line of the Soviet government, which will
 develop more and more widely."
 Shelest declares that Schwartz, "demonstrating his ignorance"
 of the history of Soviet science, falsely maintains that the
 USSR traditionally has favored applied science.  In fact,
 declares Shelest, Soviet science "traditionally" has given
 deep attention to basic problems--"in contrast to American
 sciences, which is mainly pragmatic."  In his original
 article, Shelest had complained that Soviet applied
 science "drowns out" basic science and had expressed high
 admiration for U.S. science.

 In an accompanying article, LITERATURNA UKRAINA'.aeditors accuse
 the TIMES of trying to "set scientists of the Soviet Ukraine
 against the people and the Communist Party and perceiving in
 our science some sort of crisis or difficulties."  They defend
 the discussion initiated in their paper by Shelest, noting
 that the organ of the Siberian Academy of Sciences had
 reprinted Shelest's article and citing his proposal for
 a Princeton-style institute as receiving an especially good
 response.  The editors defend public exposure of shortcomings
 in science and state that all articles in the discussion
 were constructive.  Cautiously, however, they disclaim
 responsibility for specific proposals made in.the articles,
 saying they are not qualified to judge them and must leave
 such analysis to "the responsible establishments which the
 party and state have entrusted with caring for the
 development of science" in the Ukraine.

 PRC  INTERNAL AFFAIRS
 SLOGANS SIGNAL BEGINNING OF MAY DAY PROPAGANDA BUILDUP
 Calling unusual propaganda attention to this year's celebrations,
 NCNA on 26 April released a list of 32 May Day slogans summarizing
 familiar PRC propaganda themes.  Although formal May Day slogans
 were released during the early 1950's, none hau appeared since
 1955.  Formal slogans were last released for the 20th anniversary
 of the founding of the PRC in October 1969.*
 An interesting aspect of the current slogans is the fact that
 Mao's name, directly referred to only four times in the 1969
 National Day slogans, now draws somewhat more attention, with
 eight direct references.  Mao's name has also climbed from its
 pro forma placement at the end of the 1969 list to earlier
 mention in the current set of slogans where it is tied to the
 need to deepen one's study of Mao's works--a dominant theme in
 PRC propaganda since the party plenum last September.
 The slogans concerned with domestic subjects introduce no new
 propaganda themes.  Routine victory is proclaimed for the
 cultural rev^lution, and workers, peasants, Red Guards, and
 armymen receive the customary salute.  The usual prescription
 for success in the future is given in terms of fulfilling the
 tasks set at the Ninth Party Congress and undertaking additional
 doses of struggle-criticism-transformation.   "New victories"
 are demanded to greet the 50th anniversary of the CCP and the
 convocation of the Fourth National People's Congress.
 *  Paralleling the sporadic use of May Day slogans over the
 years, slogans for National Day were issued during the early
 years of the regime up to 1953, followed by a long hiatus
 ending in 1967.
