 EAST-WEST EUROPEAN TV EXCHANGE.  The two European international
 television networks -- West Europe's non-political "Eurovision" and
 East Europe's Communist-controlled "Intervision" -- recently concluded
 an agreement for the regular exchange of newsfilm.  Thus, "Intervision"
 is now receiving coverage of world-wide events, including U.S. civil
 rights incidents and American student protests against U.S. action in
 Vietnam; and in return, "Eurovision's" member national networks are
 being supplied, for use if desired, a stream of Communist propaganda
 such as visits of Western left-wing politicians to the Soviet Union and
 East Europe, and Communist Party tours of state-run factories and farms.
 In September, the first month of the exchange, West European national
 networks used 12 from a total of 96 East European offerings.  The East
 European network received a smaller total but used a larger percentage.
 RED CHINA-WEST GERMAN TV AGREEMENT.   In October, West Germany's
 "Second Channel" television network announced an exchange agreement with
 Red China, and hopes thereby to obtain a new source of newsfilm on the
 Vietnamese War.
 FRENCH ELECTIONS AND TV.  TV played a very important part in the
 recent French elections, and it may have been De Gaulle's failure to
 use it early in the campaign which caused him the humiliation of having
 to enter a runoff against the second most popular man, Francois Mitterand.
 CONGO APPOINTS NEW INFORMATION COMMISSIONER.  The new Mobutu gov-
 ernment in the Congo (Leopoldville) has appointed Jean-Jacques Kande, a
 Congolese graduate of the higher school of journalism of the Institute
 of Advanced International Studies, Paris as High Commissioner for Infor-
 mation and Tourism.
 TWO NIGERIAN ENGLISH LANGUAGE PAPERS FAIL.  Two highly popular, but
 unprofitable English language newspapers in Nigeria have been forced to
 close because of continuing deficits.  They are the Daily Express, which
 had a circulation of about 52,500 and the Sunday Express, which had a
 circulation of 68,000.  Both were owned by Lord Thomson of Fleet, the
 British news magnate.
 SOUTH AFRICA INCREASES INTERNATIONAL BROADCASTING.  The South
 African Government has greatly expanded its international radio broad-
 casting, and is now transmitting 30 hours of propaganda per day (there
 is some overlap due to simultaneous transmissions in more than one lan-
 guage) in English, French, Portuguese, Spanish, German and Dutch.

 SOVIETS EXPANDING RADIO FACILITIES NEAR CHINESE BORDER.  The USSR's
 new Radio House under construction at Alma Ata, capital of the Soviet
 Kazakh Republic, will double to six, transmitters capable of reaching
 into the Sinkiang-Uigur Autonomous Region, China's westernmost province,
 only 150 miles away.  The announcement of the new facilities in
 Sotsialistik Kazakhstan, Alma Ata's Kazakh language daily (12/18/65)
 did not imply this capability, but the broadcasting complex has long
 been programming in Kazakh and Uigur,  languages spoken on both sides of
 the border.   In Sinkiang, Uigurs form a majority of the population, and
 Kazakhs are an important minority.
 The Alma Ata Radio House, with doubled facilities for simultaneous
 transmission, may also add programs in other languages spoken in Kazakh-
 stan -- including Chinese -- ostensibly broadcasting the Moscow version
 of international developments to the Republic's multi-language residents,
 but also reaching understanding ears on the Chinese side of the border.

 Victims         Castro Explains Deport-
 of the                               ation Policy
 Revolution
 In his address for the
 7th anniversary of the
 Cuban revolution and on the eve of
 convening the Tri-continental Con-
 ference in Havana (3 Jan 66), Fidel
 Castro delivered his fullest doctri-
 nal statement explaining the poli-
 cies behind "permitting" those "who
 do not like the revolution or so-
 cialism" to leave the country.
 Castro's explanation, in addi-
 tion, goes a long way toward describ-
 ing the nature of a Communist dicta-
 torship, namely:
 the primitive nature of its eco-
 nomic concepts -- labor used in
 the production of goods is "pro-
 ductive" while many other types
 are labeled "nonproductive and
 parasitic"; those engaged in the
 latter cannot expect to be "sup-
 ported" by the real revolution-
 aries.
 subjugation of the individual by
 the state -- people must agree
 with, acknowledge, and actively
 support all government policies
 and directives; they must be will-
 ing to go anywhere and engage in
 any type of work demanded by the
 communist bureaucracy.  Castro
 says, for example, "those ... who
 do not know how to do any but un-
 productive or unnecessary work
 and whose contracts are canceled,
 ...  let them ...  leave the coun-
 try. it
 Castro's inhumane administration
 of the emigration should be stressed
 for the not overly sophisticated.
 Firing those who wish to leave the
 country is cruel and unnecessary pun-
 ishment.   [Full excerpt from Castro's
 speech is in an attachment.]
 NormaZiza-       Czechs and Hungarians
 tion Made        Leave Home.
 Difficult
 Officials of Hungary
 and Czechoslovakia have
 each publicly admitted that in a nine
 month period'some 3,000 Czechs and
 equal numbers of Magyars have chosen
 not to return home from legal travel.
 This rising number of defections was
 made possible by more liberal travel
 regulations.   The fact that many of
 these are professionals -- physicians,
 scientists and engineers -- probably
 further aggravates the communist re-
 gimes.
 The size of the loss by secret
 escapes across borders has not been
 publicly stated.   But the tremendous
 loss of East German trained manpower
 before the Great Wall was built, and
 the continuing trickle since that
 time, must be in the minds of some.
 One consequence of the manpower loss
 to date has been a reversion to a
 limited policy of restriction:   in
 Czechoslovakia at least one member
 of a family must remain home if others
 travel (e.g., a "hostage" policy); in
 Hungary it is reported that profes-
 sional men are having greater diffi-
 culty in obtaining permits to travel.

 PROPAGANDIST'S GUIDE to COMMUNIST DISSENSIONS
 Principal Developments:
 Commentary       8 Dec 1965-4 Jan 1966
 1.  The USSR presses its new counter-attack against ComChina slightly
 more sharply in a Dec.  12 Pravda editorial pegged to the 5th anniversary
 of the 81-party Moscow meeting.   It also announces that a Kadar-led
 Hungarian Party delegation visited Moscow Dec.11-14 and that Soviet de-
 legations would visit states bordering on China in January:  Brezhnev-
 led to Mongolia, and Shelepin-led to North Vietnam.  Moreover, several
 pieces of evidence during this period -- a highly sensitive secret re-
 port of inside CPSU information passed to a Western CP, a confidential
 Yugoslav source on the October Brezhnev-Gomulka meeting, the overt
 Yugoslav report described in this Chrono, Dec.  18 & 20, and the Jan. 3
 Se'ymbUr Fre1din story from London -- indicate a Soviet effort to spread
 the impression that they fear major Chinese border warfare in the not-
 too-distant future.  The Soviets also announce preparations to double
 their radio broadcasting capabilities at Alma-Ata on the Central Asian
 frontier with China.
 2.  Chinese (and Albanian) anti-Soviet attacks seem to indicate increas-
 ingly frenzied frustration.  On Dec. 21, People's Daily challenges the
 "cowardly" new leadership of the CPSU to "step forward like men and
 conduct debate with us."  NCNA on the 22nd openly accuses the Soviets
 of "joining with the U.S. imperialists to vilify China and to drive a
 wedge between China and Vietnam," charges which PD embellishes on the
 following day, blaming the Soviets for planting rumors about Chinese de-
 mands for dollar payments for transshipping aid to Vietnam and declaring
 that "a great part of the Soviet military equipment supplied to Vietnam
 has consisted of obsolete equipment discarded by the Soviet armed forces
 or damaged weapons, "inferior both in quality and quantity to Soviet aid
 to the Indian reactionaries.  On the 27th, PD calls the 20th UNGA session
 an "anti-China conference" pursuing a policy of "American-Soviet coopera-
 tion for domination of the world."  On the 30th, PD reprints the Dec.  12
 Pravda editorial and extracts from other Soviet comments on the 5th an-
 niversary of the 81-party meeting, calls the CPSU leaders betrayers of
 the 1957 and 1960 documents, brands the Soviet "united action slogan"
 a "poisoned weapon," and again threatens to "draw a line of demarcation,
 both politically and organizationally "between themselves and the CPSU
 leadership.  And on Jan. 4, Chen Yi thrice denies to a Japanese CP
 Akahata correspondent that China has been isolated in the Afro-Asian
 world, maintaining that, although the "modern revisionists" and "certain
 individuals" in the A-A countries are conducting the "anti-Chinese hulla-
 baloo, they are after all only a small handful."

 3. In addition to their "routine" attacks on the CPSU, the Albanians on.
 Dec. 30 charge that "the Soviet revisionists are planning to hold some
 meeting of socialist country parties soon, with the French and Italian
 parties participating, on the subject of the Vietnam war."  Their "devil-
 ish plan" is to draw the North Koreans and North Vietnamese to this meet-
 ing, thus isolating China and Albania, and Shelepin's mission to Hanoi  is
 to persuade the North Vietnamese to go along with the scheme.
 4.  The most "neutral" of the European parties seems to be moving somewhat
 toward support of the Soviet approach:  the Rumanians come out in a Dec.  18
 Scinteia editorial for "unity in action" and why  a  uunites" the CPs is greater
 than any differences, while condemning polemics -- though carefully avoiding
 mention of either of the protagonists.  Also, Italian CP SecyGen Longo openly
 denounces the CCP policies as divisive, -- and British CP SecyGen Gollan en-
 dorses a new world Communist meeting.
 5.  Representatives of the CPs of the capitalist countries of Europe meet in
 Vienna to plan for another summit meeting of these parties early in 1966.
 6.  The "Tri-Continent Conference" opens in Havana as this period ends.  Al-
 though the Chinese are represented by a strong delegation, pro-Chinese dis-
 sident groups seem to be pretty well excluded and the organization and agenda
 appear to be rigged against them.  On the eve, Castro publicly reveals that
 the Chinese are drastically reducing shipments of badly-needed rice to Cuba
 25X1 C10b in the coming year.   ( T h i s Conference w i l l be covered in a separate guidance.'.)

 Yugoslav Radio's correspondent, Moscow, Sundic on the 20th reports
 that the Rumanian views "'are being studied with the greatest attention
 in Moscow," where it is considered that "these views can play a positive
 role if China accepts them."
 "However, hardly anyone believes anything like that possible,
 especially since many Chinese papers have been writing over the
 past few days that the so-called modern rev3,ionists -- that is,
 the Soviet Union, -- the U.S. imperialists, and other reactionaries
 are preparing to attack China.  This campaign, however much unfounded
 as far as the Soviet Union is concerned, disturbs the Soviet leader-
 ship much more than anything so far said by the Chinese side.  Well-
 informed circles even suspect that the opposite is hidden behind
 the :? -tent Chinese allegations. .1
 D 19-20:   Pekin  observes the 5th anniversary of the foundin  of the
 National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NFLSV) with a flurry
 of messages, editorials and a rally.  Peng Chen at the rally hits hard
 on theme of "Soviet-U.S. collaboration to dominate the world" and "the
 defeatist and capitulationist propaganda carried out by the modern re-
 visionists."                          Chou En-lai attacks Moscow for wanting peace talks and
 deprecates Soviet aid as "superficial" and offered with ulterior motives.
 D 19-21:   Austrian CP daily Volksstimme on the 19th carries a brief
 Politburo announcement that representatives of the CPs of the capitalist
 countries of Europe met in Vienna to prepare a new conference of the CPs
 of these countries in the coming year on "the problems of unifying the
 working class and the power of democracy in the struggle against monopoly
 capital."  A brief note in the Washington Post on the 21st adds:  "In-
 formed sources said that the conference would probably be held in Milan."
 D 20:  Belgrade Politika commentary by Tanyug Peking correspondent
 Bogunovic, "Chinese Throughout the World, Unite!  Why Did Chen Yi Promise
 that Chiang Kai-shek Would Be Welcome?"  points to "many indications that
 nationalism, even within China itself, is taking on the character of an
 atmosphere whose temperature is steadily rising.  One of the pertinent
 indications is ... the increase and sharpening of so-called anti-
 revisionist, and, particularly, anti-Soviet shades in the Chinese na-

 Imperialists, the Japanese Militarists, and the Soviet Revisionists Will
 Never Vanquish the Korean People," is pegged to the ratification of the

 the Japanese people, and all other peoples of Asia."
 Japan Times and other papers carry a report on a "White Paper"on the
 Japanese CP compiled by the Public Safety Investigation Agency:  one of
 the conclusions is that the JCP, despite its professed policy of independ-

 (10-16 December) reprinted "a malicious rumor from the pages of the

 the freight charges for transit of its aid supplies to Vietnam."
 "This is another instance of the K revisionists going to the
 extent of joining with the U.S. imperialists to vilify China and
 to drive a wedge between China and Vietnam....4.
 NCNA then cites "the facts":  since the signing-of a :protocol on
 30 March 1965, "all shipments of Soviet military supplies to Vietnam"
 have been transited free of charge, while on Soviet economic  supplies
 the Soviet side has "paid the freight charges in rubles in accordance
 with the provisions of the international agreement on the transportation
 of goods by railways."

 Next day People's Daily_ features a Commentator article on the subject:
 `... They (the Soviets) try to portray China as a money-grabber
 so obsessed with the lust for gain that it would profiteer in a way
 at the expense of the bloodshed and sacrifices of the Vietnamese
 people.  What motives of theirs!  Nothing could be more .. sinister....
 ... Since China and the SU are the only two parties involved ...
 isn't it clear that you and you alone are the source of the rumors
 spread by the Americans?...
 1.   After assuming power, the new leaders of the CPSU saw that
 the Vietnamese people have won tremendous victories in their anti-
 U.S. struggle, so they switched from. K's policy of disengagement
 to a policy of involvement and decide to send weapons to Vietnam.
 Their aim in doing so is to gain the right to have a say, control,
 and representation on the Vietnam question in the name of aid so
 as to strike a political deal with the U.S.
 2.  The SU is duty-bound to aid the Vietnamese....  But so far, a
 great part of the Soviet military equipment supplied to Vietnam h.s
 consisted of obsolete equipment discarded by the Soviet armed forces
 or damaged weapons cleaned out from the warehouse.  These things,
 both in quantity and quality, are not only far from commensurate
 with the strength of the SU but also far, far inferior to the aid
 the SU has given to the Indian reactionaries."

 D 30:  People's Daily editorial, "The Leaders of the CPSU Are Betrayers
 of the Declaration and the Statement' begins by accusing the CPSU of
 staging "a short anti-Chinese farce"' on the 5th anniversary of the 1960
 Moscow meeting by publishing  a batch of articles." (Accompanying, PD
 reprints the full text of the 12 December Pravda "anti-Chinese article
 and extracts from 6 others, from Izvestiya on 7th, Red Star 14th,
 Sovetskaya Rossiya 14th, Komsomolskaya Pravda 14th, Selskaya Zhizn 7th,
 and New Times No. 50.)  It then repeats succinctly previous Chinese ac-
 counts of the "intense struggles" between the M-Ls and K revisionists
 during the drafting of both (the 1957 and 1960) documents, with the CPSU
 leaders repeatedly requesting "allowances" to connect these formulations
 with the formulations of the 20th CPSU Congress and the Chinese making
 "certain concessions" to reach agreement.  "Of course, the formulation
 of certain questions      is not altogether clear and there are even weak
 nesses and errors."  The K revisionists, however, tore up both documents
 as scraps of paper on the very day they signed them and followed policies
 directly opposed."  (Charges are spelled out.)
 Revealing how the Soviet campaign is hurting, the Chinese cry:  I'The
 slogan of 'united action' has now become a poisoned weapon in the hands
 of the K revisionists for sowing dissension.`'  Then, returning to another
 old tack;
 "By clinging to their revisionism and splittism, the new leaders
 of the CPSU have placed themselves in direct antagonism to M.-L.  In
 such circumstances, can the M-Ls be expected to fail to draw a line
 of demarcation  both  oliticall  and organizationally, between them-
 selves and the new leaders of the CPSU?...'

 support for the colonial and racist regime of Rhodesia" and the K re-

 a socialist country, because the latter is small and does not want to
 march in step with revisionism" while they "continue to have very cordial
 relations with American imperialism which is setting fire and shedding
 blood in socialist Vietnam."  It takes off on a new line:
 "It is obvious that in slandering the CPR the Soviet revisionists
 are trying to isolate China and to slow down the aid it is giving to
 the fraternal Vietnamese people's struggle.
 "It would seem that, in an effort to conceal their betrayal,
 the Soviet revisionists are planning to hold some meeting of social-
 ist country parties soon, with the French and Italian CPs participat-
 ing, on the subject of the Vietnam war.  Their aim and interest is
 also to attract to this meeting the Vietnam Workers Party and the
 Korean Workers Party.  By this devilish plan, the revisionists are
 aiming at two birds with one stone:  first, to 'prove' that on the
 subject of the Vietnamese people's struggle there is complete
 solidarity among all socialist countries, China and Albania ex-
 cepted; second, that all participants at this meeting stand on the
 same ideological positions with the exceptions of the CCP and the
 Albanian Workers Party.
 "'... It may be said with certainty that this Machiavellian plan
 by the K revisionists is doomed to failure for the reason that neither
 the Vietnam Workers Party headed by Comrade Ho Chi Minh nor the
 Korean Workers Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-song will fall into
 these traps and vile provocations....  They will submit neither to
 the pressures nor the perfidious demagogy of K envoys of the type
 of A. Shelepin --- who, as reported by TASS, is shortly to visit Hanoi
 -- who, along with others, is certainlZ going there to 'convince'
 the Vietnamese comrades of the 'necessity' and 'importance' of such
 a meeting to the Vietnamese people's struggle....""

 976.                        THE 23RD CPSU CONGRESS:
 Preliminary Guidance
 25X1 C10c
 SITUATION:    The CPSU has scheduled its 23rd Party Congress for
 29 March 1966-- in a slight violation of the Party statutes which re-
 quired it to be held before October 1965, i.e., no more than ?+ years
 after the 22nd.
 The 22nd Congress, clearly dominated by Khrushchev, approved a new
 (the 3rd  Party Program drafted by a Khrushchev-chaired commission, finally
 replacing the Lenin-attributed 2nd Program adopted by the 8th Congress in
 1919.   Called "Khrushchev's Blueprint for Communist Conquest" by our staff
 study of 31 August 1961, this new 3rd Program repeated thexausty?obsolete
 Communist forecasts of the impending doom of capitalism; codified the in-
 novations in theory propounded in Khrushchev's marathon speeches over the
 years of his ascendancy (different roads to socialism, peaceful transition
 to socialism, peaceful coexistence, etc.); introduced some highly unortho-
 dox new formulations ("dictatorship of the proletariat" no longer needed
 in USSR, replaced by "state of the whole people," etc.); outlined in ambi-
 tious terms a 20-year project for economic, social and educational develop-
 ment which would set the stage for the transition to full Communism; and
 closed with the ringing proclamation that: "The present generation of
 Soviet people will live in Communism."
 The positive impact of this document among Communists and at large
 was considerably reduced, however, by other developments at the Congress,
 especially the public exposure of the degree of dissension in the World
 Communist Movement (WCM), and Sino-Soviet tensions in particular, as
 Khrushchev denounced the Albanians -- bringing angry counter-attacks by
 the latter and ademonstrative premature departure by Chou En-lai -- and
 subsequently went on to imply Chinese complicity with the Albanians.
 K and others also attacked the Soviet "anti-Party group" (Molotov,
 Malenkov, et al) and set in motion the official "de-Stalinization cam-
 paign," publicly denouncing Stalin for a wide range of crimes far beyond
 the charges of K's secret speech at the 20th Congress in 1956.   Stalin's
 body was removed from Lenin's company in the mausoleum while the Congress
 was in session, and K spoke of erecting a monument in honor of his victims.
 (Chou, before Stalin's body was removed, demonstratively laid a wreath on
 his grave before departing.)

 CPSU leaders and media have said very little about plans for the
 23rd Congress thus far, leaving us with the impression that they are
 holding it only because further postponement would be embarrassing and
 that they will endeavor to ignore or pass ambiguously over the many
 highly controversial questions and issues now evident in Soviet domestic
 and foreign affairs.  The only authoritative treatment of the subject
 to come to our attention to date, an 11 November Pravda editorial "In
 Anticipation of the 23rd Congress of the Leninist Party," supports such
 an impression with its bland generalities, such as:   "Implementing firmly
 and consistently the Leninist general line expressed in the decisions of
 the 20th and 22nd Congresses, in the CPSU Program [heavily Khrushchevite:
 our note], and developed at the October and November 196+ and March and
 September 1965 plenums of the CPSU/CC [anti-Khrushchevite], the Party
 directs its activity toward a single aim -- to make our country even
 mightier and more flourishing and uninterruptedly to improve the life
 of the Soviet people."
 Perhaps a better clue to future CPSU policies was given by the ap-
 pearance last fall of the first post-Khrushchev version of CPSU history,
 the 2nd edition of the KPSS Spravochnik (CPSU Handbook), analyzed in
 BPG Item #951, referenced below.   In it, the Party is wiping out the ex-
 cesses of the Khrushchev "cult," but not reducing him to an "unperson,"
 and simultaneously retreating from the extreme criticism of Stalin under
 K.  The 3rd Program's grandiose claims and goals for building Communism
 in the USSR in 20 years are passed over in silence, but there is no
 criticism of the Program itself, and its principal political formulations
 are still listed factually.   In treating the WCM, the new edition muddies
 the accurate report of the 1st edition that the 1960 81-party meeting in
 Moscow had designated "revisionism as the main danger," by making a bland
 statement on decisive struggle "against revisionism as well as against
 dogmatism and sectarianism."
 As even more recent indication of Soviet intent to slide quietly
 out of any time schedule for the building of Communism is seen in a 25
 November 1965 Sovetskaya Rossiya article by Moscow University Professor
 of Philosophical Sciences Chesnokov which repeatedly emphasizes that
 the transition from socialism (the first stage of Communism")' to "mature"
 Communism will be "long and gradual," and "we still have a long way to
 go."  "The gradualness of the transition from socialism to Communism is
 one of its most important characteristics."                                   25X1A2g
 The sweeping economic changes being discussed and enacted in the
 USSR at this time, especially the moves toward decentralization of plan-
 ning and control and acceptance of the profit motive as the principle
 determinant of production, can hardly be avoided by the Congress.
 The catastrophic failures of Soviet agriculture should also come
 up for consideration.

 The 23rd Congress will also have to confirm or reshuffle the wide-
 spread personnel assignments made by the CC since Khrushchev's ouster,
 and particularly the Podgorny-Shelepin shuffle in December.
 Regarding the international aspects, a secret report states that
 all CPs around the world have been invited to send two representatives
 to the Congress: on the basis of past performance, it can be expected
 that at least one of them will be a leading figure.  De facto;, this
 would provide for the much-discussed world CP conference:   however, it
 is very likely that not only the Chinese-aligned but also some of the
 "anti-conference-at-this-time neutralists" (Rumanians, Italians, etc.)
 would refuse to attend unless assured that the gathering will not be
 used as a world conference to discuss problems of the movement.   There
 is a strong possibility that the Albanians and Chinese, and perhaps a
 few others, will not attend in any case.

 COMMUNISM AND MINORITY PROBLEMS:
 TRANSYLVANIA
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:  Hungarian born Judith Listowel, in an article written
 for the British periodical The Listener [see attachment for November 4
 article], reported on current relations between ethnic groups in Rumanian-
 held Transylvania.   She describes the bitterness between Rumanians and
 Hungarians she witnessed and notes the harsh discriminatory practices
 of the Party bureaucracy against the Hungarian minority -- e.g., in dis-
 tributing jobs and housing, and in reducing Hungarian influence in edu-
 cation.
 Ethnic minorities in East European countries have been discriminated
 against for centuries; each in turn has suffered as boundaries were re-
 drawn and parcels of land taken and retaken.   In East Europe during the
 last quarter of a century, a new element -- communism -- has sharpened
 ethnic problems and added a note of hypocrisy to the treatment of minor-
 ity peoples.   The power structure of Communist Parties has been used to
 favor majority group members at the expense of those belonging to the
 minority and has accentuated the bitterness between groups.   This situ-
 ation is all the more ironic because, as Listowel comments,
 "What is not generally realized is that under a
 communist regime, which preaches equality for all
 races, the Hungarians stiZZ have such bitter griev-
 ances."
 Transylvania has the largest minority group in East Europe --
 1,588,000 Magyars account for approximately 9% of the total population.
 This territory was given to Rumania as the result of the dismantling
 of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after WW I in the Treaty of Trianon.
 Mussolini backed by Hitler gave the northern half back to Hungary in
 the Vienna Award of 1940.   Then, at the end of WW II, the Soviets re=
 stored the Trianon Border to give Rumania control of Transylvania.
 This Soviet action served to balance the territories which the USSR
 took from Rumania, namely Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, now com-
 prising the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic.   In a comparable

 balancing act, Poland looks to the USSR for its main support to retain
 the German territory (from its prewar border to the Oder-Neisseline)
 which it acquired (provisionally) after WW II and which offsets eastern
 Polish territory taken by the Kremlin. In each case, the countries in-
 volved are indebted to the USSR for the acquisition of one piece of
 territory, or are dependent upon the Kremlin for some comparable reason.
 The Hungarian uprising in 1956 was reflected in dissidence in
 Transylvania university circles which culminated in the jailing of
 Magyars as political prisoners, some of whom presumably still remain
 in custody.    Since July 1965 Rumania has permitted members of minority
 groups in Transylvania to apply for and receive exit permits -- perhaps
 to reduce the explosive potential of the discontented Magyar population.
 While Germany and Israel are apparently welcoming their people, Hungary
 has not removed obstacles to the return of its ethnic population,
 Kadar's policy remains as he stated it in Rumania in 1958, namely --
 Magyars must turn to Bucharest and not to Budapest for help.  Apparently,
 the Hungarian Communist regime will not willingly give up any claim to
 Transylvania by encouraging the departure of the Hungarians.

 INDIA, FAMINE AND COMMUNIST DEMAGOGUERY
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:    Faced with what could be the most disastrous food crisis
 in the twentieth century, with the ensuing probability of food riots and
 extensive civilian unrest and with:   a national election in 1967; an un-
 resolved dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir; a fear of further aggression
 by Communist China and Pakistan; widespread public sentiment that the US
 and UK failed to support her against Pakistan; and a growing conviction
 that the Soviet Union is her only true friend -- India is particularly
 receptive and vulnerable to Soviet influence at this time.*
 On the other hand, India's enormous problems provide the Soviet Union
 a made-to-order propaganda field which the Communists callously exploit.
 The anti-PL 480 food and "Hate America" campaign now being pushed in India
 is part and parcel of a continuous long range Soviet effort to solidify its
 relations with India to the exclusion of the West and of Communist China,
 to reconcile the divided Communist Party of India, and to gain supremacy
 in the gravely exacerbated Sino-Soviet dispute.
 Parallel Soviet propaganda efforts elsewhere tend to distract inter-
 national attention from the anti-food imports campaign in India.   Never-
 the less, this latter campaign is dovetailed with other Soviet propaganda
 offensives while, ironically enough, the Communist Chinese adapt it to
 their particular brand of anti-West, anti-Soviet and anti-Indian reaction-
 aries propaganda.
 Through its attacks on the PL 480 food program, which President
 Johnson recently agreed to step up to avert the famine which confronts
 India, the Soviet Union has for the first time turned foreign aid to
 avert famine into a propaganda weapon.  With the assistance of the vit-
 riolic Indian leftist press and factions of both the pro-Soviet Right
 (CPI/R) and the pro-Communist Chinese Left (CPI/L) Communist Parties of
 India, the Soviet Union seeks to convince India (and other developing
 countries) that western aid is a form of political blackmail.   It accuses
 the US of using "aid with strings" pressure to force India to negotiate
 (surrender) the Kashmir dispute with Pakistan and to settle the India-
 Pakistan conflict according to the demands of the "imperialists."  It 25X1C10 b

 plays on resurgent national pride, and the drive for self-sufficiency
 following India's defense against Pakistan and stand in calling Communist
 China's bluff of aggression along her borders, to further ruthlessly ex-
 ploit India's dependence upon US food, warning India that the US intends
 to use foreign aid to force India into total submission to all "imperi-
 alist" desires.
 The anti-PL 180 propaganda, as well as other communist attempts to
 poison the Indian mind against the West and turn it towards the Soviet
 Union, flared up just about the time the Chinese Communist accusations
 of collaboration between the Soviet Union and the US became rampant.*
 Perhaps in rebuttal of Chinese Communist polemics and surely in
 connection with them, Indian communists launched the anti-food import
 theme in the New Age, the CPI/R weekly organ, in early October with an
 article headlined "American Food Blackmail:  To Hell with P.L. 480."
 On 25 October, the Blitz National Forum, of the pro-Soviet weekly
 Blitz publication, put out a 53-page book entitled Freedom from Foreign
 Food - Pernicious Effects of PL 480, by "an expert on food and agricul-
 ture," Dr. Sulekh C. Gupta, with a fgreword by N.C. Chatterjee, President
 of Blitz National Forum.   The latter's argument in essence, runs as fol-
 lows:  the US withholds PL 480 aid to extract political concessions and
 to checkmate domestic reforms; and US food aid has "disastrous conse-
 quences on our own food production."  Then, in a call which would amount
 to voluntary starvation for multitudes if followed, the author distorts
 a quotation to say, "Faced with a similar situation, President Nasser
 asked his people to drink water from the Mediterranean (rather) than
 fill their bellies with American wheat and surrender their souls.  We
 in this country can do no Zess."**
 The book spells out the Soviet anti-PL 480 line subsequently re-
 flected and enlarged upon in the leftist press, in opposition arguments
 in Parliament and in Soviet commentary.   (See unclassified attachments).
 *   FYI:  The CPSU's appeals to the CCP for "unity of action" within
 the international movement and against the "aggressive imperialist
 policy of aggression and war," have all been strongly rebuffed by
 the CCP.   In an exchange of secret letters between the two parties
 on 18 September and 18 October regarding the Kashmir dispute, the
 Chinese accuse the Soviet Union of being in collusion with the US
 and of supporting Indian reactionaries in their extra-territorial
 claims against China."  (See Propagandist's Guide to Communist
 Dissensions, #68, dated 24 Nov-7 Dec 1965.)
 ** Nasser, too, is concerned first with feeding his people.  On 3 Jan-
 uary 1966, formalities were concluded between the US and Egypt to
 provide PL 480 food to Egypt in the amount of 55 million dollars
 for a six months period for immediate relief of Egypt's food crisis.
 Yet there has been no evidence of Communist anti-PL 480 campaigns
 directed towards Egypt's acceptance of Western food imports.

 For example, on 12 November a CPI/R sponsored resolution was de-
 feated in the Lok Sabha (Lower House of Parliament) which stated that
 "Continued dependence on imports of foodgrains under PL 480 ... is
 derogatory to our honor and injurious to our economy."  In moving the
 resolution, the CPI/R leader charged that the US was using PL 480 as a
 political weapon and claimed that the broad spectrum of Indian econo-
 mists found that continued PL 480 assistance was injurious to the nation's
 economy.  Misrepresenting the operation of the food program, he sought:
 to prove that it was of economic benefit only to the US, and through US
 accumulation of rupees and provision for US uses, it constituted a grave
 threat to India.
 The same themes were repeated in additional parliamentary debates
 and media "exposes," and propagandized by Communist front organizations
 such as the pro-Soviet All India Peace Council which held demonstrations
 in late November protesting "PL-480 Blackmail," arms aid to Pakistan,
 and warning "imperialists to keep their hands off Asia and Africa."
 Leaders of both the CPI/R and CPI/L seized the anti-PL 480 campaign
 as a platform upon which the rival communist parties could enthusiasti-
 cally join,which suggests anti-PL 480 was partially concocted as a mutu-
 ally satisfactory issue upon which they could unite in response to clas-
 sified reports that the Soviet leaders have advised the CPI/R to join
 with other leftist parties, particularly the CPI/L, in a united front
 against the ruling Congress Party.   (See references for background of
 party policies regarding the Kashmir Problem and Communist China.)
 However, only a few Indian leaders have fallen for the communist
 anti-PL 480 line.   Minister of Food Subramanian strongly defended food
 imports in the Rajya Sabha (Upper House).  He denounced CPI/L criticisms
 of PL-480 and accused the communists of seeking to take political advan-
 tage of the nation's present war-born desire to become more self-reliant --
 pointing out that the Soviets are themselves not self-sufficient in food
 and have imported millions of tons of wheat from the US, and that Soviet
 imports of food  were 70 lbs. per capita as against 20 lbs. per capita
 for India.   Subramanian asked why the communists had not called for the
 end of PL 480 deliveries when India had enjoyed a bumper:: crop, instead
 of waiting for the time when the food position was critical.
 Even after the exchange of notes 10 December 1965 amending the PL
 480 agreement between India and the US to meet India's immediate food
 needs, communist propaganda against food imports continues unabated.
 Soviet propaganda only subtly criticizes the Indian government for
 its shortsightedness in economic planning, blaming Indian reactionary
 forces and accusing them of "using the food shortages as a means of
 pressure on the Indian Government" to achieve a "rightist shift in the
 country's policy, a reorientation of foreign policy, and closer ties
 with the United States."  Late December commentary from Moscow further
 ties in the food shortage with Indian reactionary attempts to "torpedo"

 the Tashkent meeting between President Ayub Khan and Prime Minister
 Shastri and to discredit the Soviet "mediation mission."
 Communist Chinese propagandists exploit the Indian food shortage
 to condemn both the US and the Soviet Union -- and in addition turn the
 foreign aid issue towards violent criticism of the Shastri government.
 A 5 November Peking commentary, "The More US Aid the Smaller the Loaf,"
 ridicules Shastri for his appeal for a voluntary weekly fast, and then
 states, "this famine shows with bitter proof what Shastri's government
 has brought to the Indian people through his reliance on US imperialism."
 Peking continues the attack by noting "there are people who say:   'Don't
 fight against US imperialism or you will receive no US aid and then there
 will be no bread for your daily meals.'   India's experience shows just
 the opposite.   It shows that the more US aid the smaller the loaf of
 bread.   The Shastri government, acting as a servant of US imperialism,
 has plunged India into its present miserable plight.   This provides the
 Asian and African people with a vivid lesson in a negative sense.
 Shastri's call to miss a meal every week only shows that one can eat
 too much American bread."
 In a swipe at the Soviet Union, Peking states, "There are people
 who say 'The principal task for Afro-Asian countries now is to solve
 major economic problems, not to fight against US imperialism.'   Here
 again India's experience shows just the opposite.   It shows that if
 you don't fight against imperialism you cannot solve the economic
 problems..."
 Other Communist Chinese propaganda accuses Shastri of "apparently
 trying to placate the bitter, starving people" by beating the drum for
 arms expansion in preparation for war against China and Pakistan.   He
 was further accused of "indicating his government's intention of fleec-
 ing the Indian people by compelling them to contribute gold for the
 purchase of gold bonds..." and "whipping up war hysteria" in an attempt
 "to distract the attention of the disgruntled people."                       25X1 C19

 979.      25X1 C1 Ob OMMUN I STS DOMINATE DOMINICAN PARTY
 SITUATION:   In mid-December 1965 a leading figure of the pro-Castro
 party, the Movimiento Revolucionario 14 de Junio - MR-,IJ4 (formerly known
 as the "Agrupacion Politica 14 de Junio" - APCJ), was expelled by the
 party for speaking out against certain members of the party's leadership
 and for criticizing the road the party was taking.   This was Luis Genao
 Espaillat, a member of the Central Executive Committee of the party and
 a former chief of the Dominican guerrillas who unsuccessfully revolted
 against the Reid Cabral regime in November 1963.  The incident was first
 reported in an article which appeared in El Caribe of Santo Domingo on
 16 December 1965.  The following day a second article appeared in which
 Genao stated his side of the dispute:   The major part of the highest
 leadership of the 14th of June Revolutionary Movement is Communist-
 directed and it is leading the party down a false path since he himself,
 having been to Communist China, North Korea, and North Vietnam, could
 testify that the Communist system in those countries is a complete fail-
 ure and the people live in misery and under an ugly dictatorship.
 The party denied this the next day:   For the leadership of the MR-
 1J4 the statement about China, North Korea, and North Vietnam is an in-
 sult to their heroic fights....  The people in those countries have freed
 themselves from the colonial oppression of imperialism and they go strong
 and happy in the building of their new life.
 Things quieted down again until 28 December 1965 when Genao held a
 press conference, attended by local and foreign press representatives.
 The highlights of the conference were:
 A.   Genao asked the militants of the party to eliminate the
 Communists and to lead the party on the road which its founder,
 Manolo Tavarez Justo, wanted.   Tavarez was not a Communist but a
 nationalist.
 B.   Of the 14th of June leaders, Fidelio Despradel belongs to
 the Dominican Communist Party, and "Fafa" Taveras, Juan B. Mejia,
 and Julio de Pena Valdez are members of the Dominican Popular Move-
 ment (pro-Chicom).

 C.   The 14th of June receives funds from Moscow, Havana, and
 Peking through the embassies of those countries in Europe.   The
 party sends its delegates to these embassies and they bring back
 money and propaganda material.
 D.   The 14th of June opposes the coming Dominican elections
 because it believes in obtaining power through violence.
 E.   Genao said he had had interviews in China with Mao Tse-
 tung; in North Vietnam with Ho Chi-Minh; in Algeria-with Ben Bella;
 and in Cuba with Fidel and Raul Castro, "Che" Guevara, and Camilo
 Cienfuegos in 1959.  He requested aid from all these people and
 they agreed to give it.
 The party's rebuttal to thin damning statement came the next day.
 Its leaders charged that Genao is a CIA agent, that in countries governed
 by Communist regimes there is progress in social order, politics and eco-
 nomics, Communist China being a good example.   They averred that they
 would support a Marxist-Leninist regime if one came to power in the Do-
 minican Republic; the method by which this might come about was eirident
 from their further statement that holding elections in the Dominican
 Republic would be foolishness, that the proper climate for elections
 does not exist.  And they said that representative democracy is not the
 solution to Latin American problems, attacking what they classified as
 the "false democratic" regimes under which Latin America has suffered.'

 fied attachment, along with English translations, a biographic note on
 Luis Genao Espaillat, and a short summary of these events.

 Castro Explains Cuban Exodus
 "... some people ... do not understand why
 we facilitate the exit of those who wish
 to leave the nation."
 Excerpts from Fidel Castro's speech on
 the occasion of the seventh anniversary
 of the Cuban Revolution -- 2 January 1965
 "The fact that the imperialists have had to open their doors which
 they had closed after the October crisis to those elements, well, this
 is a result of the policy and action of revolution which they could not
 resist, because it is certain that they do not take away even the best
 (of the Cuban people -- ed.).   This nation can give itself credit for
 permitting those who are not satisfied with socialism to leave.   There
 are enough people in this nation and this revolution who are satisfied
 and have decided to live under socialism.  Of course, I do not see that,
 within a Marxist view, that there exists a pretext which established the
 obligation of the proletariat and the peasants to feed those who do not
 work or produce.
 "We are not obligated to put up with such displaced elements, many
 of whom have never worked and are incapable of working, and many of whom
 are agents of the enemy in the midst of our society.
 "Of course, since I have brought up this subject and since there
 was no-previous occasion to discuss any particular question related to
 it, the situation has arisen that those who have requested permission
 to leave the country -- and since for example there were cases of gentle-
 men who in bureaucracy, or, if you wish, in the surplus of administrative
 employees, had been rationalized and they were being paid the same salary
 to go to a school to study -- when one of those gentlemen requests per-
 mission to leave the country, must we grant that gentleman that right,
 (presumably Castro means the right to continue to draw a salary -- ed.)
 something which must truly be granted to a revolutionary?

 "Why?  If in a school where the children of our workers and our
 peasants study there is a teacher who requests permission to leave for
 the United States, is it correct that he continue to teach the children
 of the workers, of our peasants?  There are other cases of the same
 type.
 "Why do I say this?  Because some of these gentlemen have had the
 audacity to try to create a certain emotionalism because many of their
 contracts have been canceled.  Well and good.  What is the policy of
 the revolution?  I take advantage of this occasion to clarify it with
 respect to these gentlemen.  First, all who are engaged in nonproduc-
 tive work producing material goods and who are not necessary for pro-
 duction, or to put it better, who are not necessary for certain serv-
 ices, will have their contracts terminated.
 "Now, then, some ask themselves:   'Well, and what thought is being
 given as to how they are going to live and from what they are going to
 live?'  Well, we must say that it would be a zeal.crime, a real injus-
 tice that while nearly 70,000 workers separate themselves from their
 families for months at a time and go to cut cane, that with the sweat
 and the work of those workers we have to support crowds of drones who
 will produce absolutely nothing.   That is why the policy of the revo-
 lution -- there must be no mistake about this, nobody must allow him-
 self to be confused -- is the following:  We have never promoted meas-
 ures of any type which will impose hunger on anyone -- never, not even
 with our most recalcitrant enemies.
 "....     All those who simply decide to leave for the United States,
 and who because of the type of unproductive, unnecessary work they do
 have their contracts terminated, may -- if they are in physical con-
 dition -- choose to go to work where our workers are working in produc-
 tive agricultural work, for example, in the sugarcane harvest for ex-
 ample.                                         We will give them work, but another type of work so they can
 earn their sustenance while producing and not as parasites.
 "Those who perform useful work, who participate in the production
 of material goods or in necessary services, we will maintain them in
 their jobs, except where they may be in a position where they could do
 some harm to production.  We believe that this is a clear policy to
 maintain in their jobs those who participate in the production of
 material goods or in necessary services, except positions which could
 be called 'strategic' in production,  And of course, not even remotely,
 will a single one be left directing or administering anything at all.

 "Now, then, those cases that are not fit for that type of work
 and do not know how to do any but unproductive or unnecessary work and
 whose contracts are canceled, those who are in that category, who for
 reasons of that type cannot do any other work, let them apply to the
 Interior  Ministry, explain their case, and then for humanitarian
 reasons -- so that there may be no one who can say that he found him-
 self without a solution -- he will be supported until it is his turn
 to leave the country.
 "This means that there will be absolutely no one for whom there
 is no solution.   Now, then, if one of them has to wait a year, or two
 years, is it our fault when we proposed to the imperialists to send
 airplanes, if they wanted to, so that 10,000 or 12,000 could leave
 every month?  It is they who have established the quota.   It is they
 who have established limits because, as far as we are concerned, we
 were in favor of a broad flow.   However, if anyone has to wait many
 months here, let him be grateful for that to his little Yankee friends
 who are the ones who are to blame.
 "If the Yankees want, they can support them, but it will not be
 our peasant people and our workers who are going to shoulder that load.
 This is the policy and we accept full responsibility for this policy.   ...."

 The case of a minority
 By Judith Listowel
 on the Hungarians in Transylvania
 Soon after I left my native Hungary I was to realize -- even before
 I had got off the train -- how harsh still is the fate of those Hungari-
 ans who live over the Rumanian border.                                     A tall man with haggard features
 entered our compartment.   He sat down opposite the fat woman who had
 been holding forth about the excellent living conditions in Rumania and
 stressing how much better they were than in Hungary.
 'How do you know?' the newcomer asked.
 'I spent two months with my sister in Budapest', the woman said.
 'Some days she could get no meat, some days she had to queue even for
 bread...'
 'In Transylvania', the man answered,  'Hungarians have to queue for
 other things -- such as decent jobs, which seem to be reserved for Ruma-
 nians'.   At this acid reply, the other occupants of the carriage sat up
 expectantly.
 The fat woman retorted:   'Hungarian chauvinist rubbish, of which
 we have had enough'.
 'Judging by the way you speak the language', the man said,  'I
 thought you might be a Hungarian yourself -- or are you just a talented
 Rumanian?'   He could not have been more sarcastic.
 'What business is it of yours whether I was born of Hungarian or
 of Rumanian parents?' she answered back.   'I believe it's time that
 these two peoples learnt to live in peace with each other and joined
 forces in building a better world for both'.
 The man pulled his cap further down over his eyes.   'That's the
 theory, but can you tell me why most of the workers in the new Transyl-
 vania factories are imported from Old Rumania?  And why do Rumanians
 receive the best accommodation, regardless of local needs?'
 'More unsubstantiated statements', the woman nearly snarled.
 'Rumanians are brought in because locally there are not enough quali-
 fied people for the many new jobs we are creating.   Good workers de-
 serve good conditions'.
 The man's answer was to quote a conversation he had overheard be-
 tween two Rumanians in front of a list of flats outside the town hall.
 According to him it went like this:

 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000300060001-3
 'I wish I could get that flat; at last my family would have a
 decent roof'.
 'And why couldn't you get it?'
 'I've only just arrived; I haven't even got my identity card'.
 'You've got your diploma and you're a Rumanian, so why shouldn't
 you get promptly suited?'
 The man said he had taken the trouble to find out the sequel and
 within three days the Rumanian had both a job and the flat he wanted.
 'So', the man finished, 'I raised the matter at our next council meet-
 ing, for I am a member...'
 The woman was furious now.   She came back at him:   'I wish my
 husband had been at your meeting.   He would have given you a full
 answer, and he's a party member too, and a member of our town council'.
 It was indeed a remarkable conversation:  both the fat woman and
 the haggard man belonged to the party, and so they dared to speak openly.
 But good communists though they were, the man felt strongly on behalf
 of the Hungarians, and the woman defended the Rumanians.
 For 900 years these two nationalities have lived side by side in
 Transylvania.   In the old days, the Hungarians were the landowners and
 the professional men; the Vlachs, as the Rumanians were then called,
 were the mountain people who tended their goats and reaped their meagre
 harvests; the Saxons, who were invited in medieval times by the Hungar-
 ian kings to settle in the towns,`had become the artisan class.  But
 gradually the Vlachs increased in numbers, descended into the valleys,
 and with the spread of education began to compete for jobs.  After 1919,
 when, as a result of the Treaty of Trianon, Transylvania was given to
 Rumania, they took over both the state and the county administrations.
 Overnight they had power and influence.
 Between the two wars, when the League of Nations offered some pro-
 tection to national minorities; Hungarian complaints against the Ruma-
 nian Government often figured on the agenda.   What is not generally
 realized is that under a communist regime, which preaches equality for
 all races, the Hungarians still have such bitter grievances.
 While the two communists continued arguing I went out into the
 corridor to admire the landscape.   Transylvania is as beautiful as
 Wales, with its mountains, turbulent rivers, waterfalls, forests, and
 slanting fields.   Suddenly the man joined me and asked:   'Are you a
 Hungarian?'

 I told him that I had been born in Hungary, but had spent my adult
 life in England, where I had married and where my family lived.
 'Then', he said sadly,  'you don't:-know what is going on here.   No
 one knows and no one cares.   Have you heard what happened to the Hungar-
 ian. University of Kolozsvar?'   (He was using the Hungarian name for Cluj,
 which has always been the capital of Transylvania.)
 I said I knew that it was merged with the new Rumanian University.
 He asked me if I knew any of the professors.   I mentioned a man with a
 world-wide reputation.
 'Talk to him', my companion advised.   'He is in Bucharest now'.
 He gave me his address.   A week later I sat in this professor's study.
 A professor's story
 'To understand what happened', he told me,  'you must realize that
 the Hungarian uprising of 1956 had grave repercussions far beyond Hun-
 gary's eastern boarders'.   According to him, Rumania was no exception,
 and this had greatly worried Gheorghiu-Dej, who was then Frist Secretary
 of the party.   At this time, the professor said, the party was extremely
 unpopular, for the workers resented their low wages, and the peasants
 resented the collectivization of their land.   Both were indignant be-
 cause they had no possibility of protesting.                              The professor went on to
 describe how in 1959 Gheorghiu-Dej and his closest advisers, one of
 whom was Gheorghe Ceauscescu, decided to revitalize the party. by-a three-
 pronged policy:  to arrest all would-be critics and condemn them to long
 terms of imprisonment, to launch a campaign against the Hungarians which
 would foster Rumanian nationalist aspirations, and, finally, to make a
 determined stand against Russian economic demands.   That at least would
 be guaranteed to please everyone.
 Dej entrusted the Hungarian minority in Transylvania to Ceauscescu,
 who, the professor told me, went to Cluj, in April 1959, and called a
 joint meeting of the Central Committee of the Transylvanian Communist
 Party together with the faculties of the old Hungarian and the new Ruma-
 nian universities.   It lasted from nine in the morning until four o'clock
 next morning.   Its purpose was to effect a merger of the two universities,
 which all the Hungarians regarded as a mortal blow to Hungarian culture
 and traditions.   None the less, by means of blatant intimidation the
 merger was carried through, although the Hungarian pro-rector, Professor
 Laszlo Szabedy, and five of his colleagues refused to sign.  Within a
 month, all of them, as well as Mrs Szabedy, had committed suicide.  All
 had been party members, Szabedy since 1933.

 The effect of seven suicides in a town the size of Guildford can
 be imagined.   The tragedy not only shook the Hungarian population; there
 was consternation in Bucharest as well.   The wholesale dismissal of
 Hungarian professors and lecturers did not take place.
 I spent most of my Transylvanian visit in a small town called Tirgu
 Mures, where I have relations and friends.   In view of Gheorghiu-Dej's
 three-pronged policy, my friends and relations had suffered both for be-
 longing to the upper classes and also for belonging to the Hungarian
 minority.  At least one member of every family (if not several) was
 imprisoned or deported to forced labour camps in the Danube Delta, where
 working conditions were exceptionally bad.   In 1959 things became worse:
 savage sentences were passed on Hungarian 'class-alien' elements, often
 for no reason at all.   One friend of mine got five years for saying
 that the cost of living had gone up.   Not even the judge disputed the
 fact, but he said that the manner in which she had put it had been de-
 famatory to the state.   Almost every family had benefited from the
 graziere -- the act of clemency, which the Rumanian Government passed
 in 1964.   It was not an amnesty, for that would have meant restitution
 of jobs and positions, and also financial compensation.   None the less,
 the 196+ graziere meant release from prison for over 10,000 people; many
 of them were Hungarians.
 The situation in Rumania eased up generally in 1964, and the Hun-
 garians in Transylvania found jobs and new openings.   Their greatest re-
 maining problem is housing.   There is.a shortage of accommodation.in all
 Rumanian towns, and naturally this also applies to Transylvania.   But
 the fact remains that former upper-rand middle-class Hungarians have
 been forced to live in cellars and basements under conditions of Rack-
 manist overcrowding.   Last year, in the two basement rooms occupied by
 my brother-in-law and his wife and three children, the walls were re-
 plastered, a parquet floor was laid down and an inside lavatory built
 by the landlord, that is the state -- for in Rumania as in other east
 European countries all houses with more than four rooms are state prop-
 erty.
 This basement is by no means the worst accommodation I saw in Tirgu
 Mures.   An old friend, once mistress of a lovely house, lives with her
 two sisters (all three over seventy) and two nephews in one cellar room.
 The five of them sleep on three divans.   I saw a mouse run across the
 earthen floor, and cockroaches promenade on the cooker and the washstand.
 The lavatory they use is at a considerable distance.  A sixty-seven-year-
 old relation, with his wife and two sons, lives outside the city, in a
 house consisting of one room and a kitchen, without electricity or run-
 ning water.   He has to carry water from a well about a quarter of a mile
 away.   Not one of my friends or relations has a bathroom, let alone a
 telephone.

 Under these distressing conditions, living in poverty of a kind
 we in Britain can no longer conceive, what struck me most about all the
 Hungarians in Transylvania was their affection for each other, their
 willingness to share the little they had, and their patience with the
 young, who do not even have memories of the lovely days of old.
 Bothin.Bucharest and in Budapest responsible persons are avoid-
 ing comment about Hungarian grievances in Transylvania.   It seems that
 as a result of the recent visit of the Hungarian Prime Minister, Gyula
 K(illai, to Rumania their situation may improve.   Full national and cul-
 tural rights for the minorities is indeed one of the basic tenets of
 Marxism, and one that has never been openly challenged by the Rumanian
 Communist Party.  Alas, in Transylvania the theory has still not been
 fully put into practice.

 Assimilation Seen on Rise in Soviet
 Brandeis Parley Is Told of Growing Russification
 WALTHAM, Mass., Oct. 30 -- Experts on the Soviet Union gathered here
 this weekend at Brandeis University to discuss the changing patterns of
 Soviet society.
 The conference is devoted to the "state of ethnic minorities in the
 Soviet Union."  The consensus among the scholars from tuany universities and
 research centers seemed to be that there was one constant factor in the
 changes -- increased Russification of politics, culture and language.
 Dr. Serewyn Bialer of Columbia University contended that the Soviet
 Union faces one of its most far-reaching crises of leadership.
 "The elite," he said, "seems incapable of producing a single leader of
 the type of Khrushchev, let alone of Stalin's type.   It is beset by divisions
 and by factional strife which sometimes assumes an ethnic coloring."
 This thesis led another scholar to raise his eyebrows and shrug his
 shoulders.   "Some people still can't adjust themselves to the fact that the
 Soviet Union is in business and will be around for a long time," he mumbled.
 The trend toward Russification, or assimilation, was analyzed by among
 others, Prof. John A. Armstrong, director of the Russian studies program at
 the University of Wisconsin.
 Professor Armstrong said the elite apparently believed, correctly, "that
 maximum centralized control and expansion of Soviet power require a unified
 national cutlure; that given the numerical and historical predominance of
 Russians, this culture must be Russian; but that except in special cases the
 elite is not primarily motivated by Russian ethnocentrism as such."
 Professor Armstrong said the Ukrainians, the Byelorussians and the Jews
 seemed to be among the ethnic minorities "scheduled for Russification."
 The Armenians seem
 to
 enjoy a privileged position, according to Mary
 Kilbourne Matossian of
 the
 University of Delaware, and have provided most of
 their local leadership
 and
 some of the national leadership and continue to
 speak and write mainly
 in
 the Armenian language.  Mrs. Matossian said that
 traditional fear and hatred of Turkey bound Armenia to the Soviet Union,
 "and the Communist rulers have therefore treated Armenian nationalists with
 greater tolerance than the nationalism of any other ethnic group."
 Tomorrow's discussion will center on anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union
 and the future of the Jewish minority.

 New Dolhi
 Madness
 With A Meth .o.4
 IN the specrum of Leftist politics,
 ranging from Communist to what
 is called progressive in the ruling
 party, the  campaign against the
 import of foodgrains from the U.S.A.
 under .PL-480 curiously occupies the
 centre as far as its operative part is
 concerned.  Indeed, it looks as if the
 Communists have been calling the
 .tune.  It is they.who condemn it as
 derogatory  to  India's self-respect
 and damaging to  India's  position
 ._as  a   non-alined country especi-
 ally when issues like Vietnam                                 are
 i.-concerned.
 "We shall rather  starve than
 allow the U.S. imperialists to take
 away Kashmir from us" has been the
 most strident slogan in this campaign.
 As if the U.S.A. were able or willing
 to make it part of itself. The import
 of   foodgrains  from  the U.S.A.
 started some fourteen years ago, not
 because the Americans imposed it on
 us but because. we could not do with-
 out it.  Since its inception, India
 has imported  practically  without
 payment about 3. million    tonnes
 of  these  sorely   needed   food-
 grains.      And judging from what the
 Government of India has said or
 'done on questions  the U.S.A. found
 itself deeply involved in, nobody in
 `honesty could say that the import
 has in' any way impinged on this
 country's policy   of non-alinement
 much less sovereignty.
 That . the Leftist-inspired cam
 '.;paign should have reached its climax.
 at a time when India is facing the
 acutest food shortage since 1943, the
 ;fatal year in which Bengal lost, a few
 ,'million lives, would either suggest
 ..unparalleled insanity on the part of
 its, organiicrs or. madness with a
 niethod.
 CPYRGHT
 11erc are tunic of the figures that
 would show the magnitude' of the
 '':problem that stares us in the fade
 today.  Last year we . bad a record
 foodgrains harvest with ,n total out-
 -'put of 88 million tonnes.   Not even
 ,.the boldest        us  can claim
 that we are in a position to i~np: Jve
 upon this record this ysar. In fact,
 according to ccinpet+:nt r'b. crvcrs,
 the output is going to he su':stantial-
 ly lower, thanks to tinfor,',eeu cir-
 cumstances.  Meauwhi:e, o? it . p,1pu-
 lation has  gone  up by a! out 20
 million.
 It is with a view to  inana:;ing
 the scarcity, in the words of mood
 .Minister Subramanianl,  that eight
 cities with a popu'ation of over one.:
 million each are to be put wi ration- ,7:
 ing by next January a,.nd ..here are""'
 to subject similarly to short
 `:commons another 114 citi- s with a'`?
 population of over a hutnd A thou-.,

 be the answer to the p-obicni.  This
 rigorous   b-At-tighten ing  will still.-
 leave us with a dcfi it uf several
