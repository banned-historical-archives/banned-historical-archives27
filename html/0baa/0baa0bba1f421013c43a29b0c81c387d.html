THE ROOTS OF VIOLENCE: THE URBAN GUERRILLA IN ARGENTINA 
A Climate of Violence 
Violence is undermining democratic institutions in Argentina. The causes of 
this violence go far beyond the conflicts between the political right and left that 
have given rise to groups such as the People's Revolutionary Army, Montoneros, and 
Argentine Anti-Communist Alliance. These groups operate within a milieu that has 
shown a high tolerance for political violence during the past 40 years. 
Argentina is not in the throes of a civil war, nor is it trying to shake free of 
authoritarian controls. Instead, the frequent recourse to illegal tactics, both by 
legitimate organizations and by guerrilla groups, appears to stem from the dashed 
hopes of a once optimistic society that has suffered from prolonged economic and 
political stagnation and a decline in its ability to influence hemispheric events. The 
failure to achieve a great destiny despite an abundance of natural resources and 
human talent has produced a pervasive crisis of national confidence. As one observer 
has written, "The Argentine people are unsure not only of their capacity for 
achievement, but even of their ability to confront the issues dividing them." Since 
1930 the inability of national leaders to cope with major social and economic 
problems has resulted in seven military coups, recurrent bloody labor disputes, and 
recently a high level of terrorism and counterterrorism�perhaps the inevitable 
consequence of more than two generations of political drift. 
The overthrow of President Yrigoyen in 1930 ended more than a half century 
of constitutionally elected governments and gave army leaders a new sense of 
identification as rightful guardians of the republic. This "revolution of 1930" also 
inaugurated a period of frequent recourse to the use or threat of violence to 
manipulate the governmental system through coercion rather than by constitutional 
procedures. 
Violence has been a recurrent theme in a labor movement that was organized 
by socialist and anarchist immigrants in the late 19th century. During the early 
1940s Juan Peron quashed dissent by whatever means were necessary for him to gain 
control of the unions. In the process of imposing unity, Peron succeeded in making 
the labor movement the most powerful political force after the military.

During his 18-year exile, however, personal rivalries between union 
leaders and policy quarrels began a new cycle of divisive internal strife. The 
wave of strikes that started in the heavily industrialized provincial city of 
Cordoba in May 1969 was a dramatic manifestation of both resentment 
toward the government of General Ongania and tensions within Peronism. Its 
high level of violence created a new word�"cordobazo"�and spawned some 
of the leftist guerrilla groups operating today, primarily the Montoneros. At 
the height of the agitation, the murder of labor leader Augusto Vandor 
sparked a continuing series of assassinations that give union conflicts the 
, appearance of gang warfare. 
Before his return to power in 1973, Peron did not openly encourage 
violent opposition to the presidents who succeeded him, but he was reluc-
tant to condemn those who acted against the military governments of 
Ongania, Levingston, and Lanusse. He condoned�and may even have 
ordered�the abduction and assassination of Pedro Aramburu, the general 
who had ousted him in 1955. As political opposition and violence began to 
force President Lanusse to become more conciliatory toward the Peronists 
during 1971 and 1972, Peron came under increasing pressure from the 
government to denounce terrorist assassinations. His usual reaction was to 
express shock or disapproval of the particular incident, but to couple this 
with a statement charging the government with creating a climate that 
fostered violence. On one occasion he commented that if he were 50 years 
younger, he too probably would be throwing bombs. 
Until recently, Argentina was barren soil for leftist extremists. The 
stereotype Argentine was a basically conservative, family-oriented individual 
who enjoyed the good life of wine and steak and viewed most political 
developments with a mixture of detached cynicism and contempt. Anar-
chism was short lived; socialists and communists were nonviolent. In the 
early 1960s Fidel Castro was unable to organize a viable paramilitary force in 
northern Argentina. 
� There is no convenient explanation for the emergence of guerrilla 
movements in the late 1960s. One plausible rationale is that while popular 
expectations have apparently remained the same, the ability to satisfy these 
desires has dropped because of rampant inflation which inhibits productive 
growth and discourages savings. The failure of governments to muster suf-
ficient political support or attract the administrative talent necessary to 
engage in effective planning has resulted in justifiable public disillusionment 
and dissatisfaction. 
The rapid escalation of terrorist violence precipitated a counterterrorist 
reaction, as the government of Alejandro Lanusse recognized its inability to

handle the problem by legal means. Publicly Lanusse denounced the use of 
torture, but privately he allowed security forces considerable freedom of 
action. Ultimately it was urban terrorism combined with growing labor 
unrest, as well as a realization that the army could not govern, that led 
Lanusse to conciliate the Peronists and return Argentina to electoral politics 
in 1973. 
The Urban Guerrilla 
The difficulties of operating in a rural environment, dramatized by the 
death of Che Guevara in Bolivia, impressed other guerrilla movements in 
Latin America. The shift of the guerrillas' activities to the cities was also an 
attempt to take advantage of changing social conditions. The rapid growth of 
Buenos Aires in the past 40 years has produced a sprawling megalopolis of 
approximately 600 square miles. Its vastness not only allows criminals and 
revolutionaries to find easy refuge but also absorbs isolated terrorist activ-
ities. This physical climate enables guerrillas to stage numerous terrorist 
events simultaneously with relative impunity. 
Because Argentine guerrillas commit random acts of violence and abjure 
theories of revolutionary "stages" as developed by Mao Tse-tung or Che 
Guevara, the government frequently labels them wanton terrorists. In fact, 
however, they are skilled propagandists and political tacticians who employ 
terror as a psychological and military weapon. This is an important distinc-
tion, since it is their success in winning converts and gaining at least tacit 
support from the public that makes them a serious threat to the government. 
As violence has increased, two leftist groups have emerged as particu-
larly significant: the People's Revolutionary Army, which has supplanted the 
Armed Forces of Liberation as the major Marxist-oriented guerrilla organiza-
tion; and the Montoneros, who have eclipsed two rival Peronist bands. 
Specific data on the leadership structure and size of these guerrilla groups are 
fragmentary, but current estimates place the strength of the ERP at 500-700, 
while the Montoneros are believed to have approximately 1,500 militants in 
the Buenos Aires area alone, and at least 15,000 sympathizers nationally. 
Despite its comparative smallness, the ERP is the most widely feared 
leftist-extremist group. Created in July 1970 as the military arm of the 
Trotskyite Revolutionary Workers Party, it has since broken formally with 
the Fourth International but retains a strong Marxist-Leninist orientation. Its 
leader, Roberto Santucho, confers occasionally with Montonero chiefs, but 
he publicly rejects both Juan Peron and Peronism as "bourgeois." 
In contrast, the Montoneros identify themselves as Marxist-Peronists. 
While they lack the ideological and organizational cohesiveness of the ERP,

they are stronger politically, having devoted as much of their energies to 
proselytizing and legitimate reform as to guerrilla tactics. Unlike Santucho, 
Montonero spokesmen Roberto Quieto and Mario Firmenich do not identify 
the army as their principal enemy. Apparently, however, they share Santu-
cho's desire to force a military coup, which would allow them to return to 
their earlier role as the vanguard of popular opposition to the government. 
ERP and Montenero leaders have met occasionally, but the lack of any 
known joint operations suggests that their conferences have not been pro-
ductive. In fact, available evidence indicates that the groups are strong rivals 
and that the ERP decided to abandon recent efforts to build a rural base, on 
the grounds that it had failed to achieve major success and had lost a 
psychological advantage to the Montoneros in the cities. 
Beyond the fact that individual ERP members have traveled to Cuba, 
little is known about the international contacts of the Argentine guerrilla. 
Specific information is also lacking on foreign training; it is possible that 
none has been required. 
To Destroy Is To Create? 
The popular view of the urban guerrilla as a romantic nihilist may be an 
accurate appraisal, but it does not accord with the way the Argentine leftist 
sees himself. Despite the absence of profound theoretical writing and the 
apparent lack of ideological sophistication, both major guerrilla groups have 
shown exceptional talent and esprit de corps in terrorist operations. It is 
their demonstrated expertise, rather than their ill-defined, long-term objec-
tives, that makes them important subjects of study. 
The ERP has demonstrated a high degree of coordination in kidnapings 
of business executives and commando raids on small towns and military 
garrisons. Two of the most impressive operations, however, have been 
attributed to the Montoneros: 
� The spectacular assassination of the police chief of Buenos Aires, 
Alberto Villar, one of the most heavily guarded public officials, in which 
only he and his wife were killed in an explosion as they boarded a yacht 
near Buenos Aires last November; 
� The smoothly executed kidnaping of two wealthy industrialists, 
also closely protected. Their automobile was cut off from most of their 
bodyguards�a maneuver in which the guerrillas masqueraded as street 
construction workers and policemen. 
These technically expert operations provide strong evidence for the 
view that guerrillas see violence as creative acts rather than as a last resort.

LAJINIitL 
The philosophy of Franz Fanon often has been echoed in Latin America: 
"Violence frees the (individual) from his inferiority complex and makes him 
fearless and restores his self-respect.... Terrorism is an act of growing up, not 
of adolescent nihilism." If this is an accurate explanation of the attitudes of 
Argentine guerrillas, then political labels mean less than psychological 
impulses. 
Propaganda by Deed 
Tile concept of propaganda by deed�which first appeared among 
militant populists in 19th century Russia�has been adopted by the extreme 
left in Argentina. The underground press conferences and the diatribes 
against specific enemy targets in speeches and pamphlets suggest a para-
mount concern with attracting immediate public attention to the cause. 
Unlike their rural counterparts, individual urban guerrillas often rely more 
on the anonymity of the big cities for survival than on direct support or 
complicity of the population. Nevertheless, their actions show that Argen-
tine leftists have great concern for their public image and a desire to win at 
least tacit approval for their activities. 
The ERP first attracted public notice in the same "Robin Hood" 
manner as the Tupamaros in neighboring Uruguay�hijacking trucks and 
delivering cargoes of food and milk to the poor. On January 6, 1971�the 
Twelfth Night of the Christmas season�the ERP joined with the Armed 
Forces of Liberation to distribute stolen toys to children in a Buenos Aires 
slum. This particular operation was especially effective, since the police, 
acting on behalf of the vandalized company, subsequently had to take the 
toys away from many of the children. 
Although more violent activities have long been its hallmark, the ERP is 
still attentive to public opinion. Several months ago a systematic campaign 
of assassinations of army officers was halted as a result of public outrage 
over the killing of a major and his three-year-old daughter. 
The Montoneros burst upon the scene in May 1970 with the abduction, 
"trial," and "execution" of former President Pedro Aramburu�the general 
who had sent Peron into exile in 1955. This revolutionary action defined 
them immediately as young Peronist militants. Since then, Montonero 
leaders have insisted that they are the "true" Peronists, even though they 
staged a walkout during one of Juan Peron's last public appearances and have 
since formally declared war on Mrs. Peron's government. 
By their very nature, urban guerrilla movements are vulnerable to 
exploitation by criminal elements. Terrorist groups that resort to kidnapings 
for ransom and reprisal killings cannot avoid the danger that some of their 
-6-

1 ltIL. 
members will use political labels merely for their own nefarious purposes (or 
that common criminals will pose as revolutionaries). To protect their revolu-
tionary image, the guerrilla organizations have been highly selective in taking 
public credit for terrorist operations. Spokesmen Santucho, Firmenich, and 
Quieto have also sought to avoid being branded as mere murderers and 
ruffians, stating that they do not relish violence�an obvious attempt to 
justify their use of terror and reassert their ideological motives. 
It would be unrealistic to dismiss these statements as simply rhetorical 
flourishes, for there is a concerted effort by the guerrillas to link actions and 
ideology. The overriding focus on tactics and operations, however, seems to 
imply a psychological tendency to become involved in "terrorism for ter-
rorism's sake." The Argentine guerrillas are not known to have developed 
any new theories of revolution and apparently look for guidance to Carlos 
Marighella, slain Brazilian guerrilla tactician, rather than to Lenin, Mao, or 
Guevara. One astute observer of terrorist behavior, Edward Hyams, has 
noted that "terror as an attention-drawing tantrum can easily develop into a 
way of life. Power of any kind�legitimate or criminal�very soon ceases to 
be a means to some good end and becomes an end in itself." 
An Aura of Legitimacy 
The Montoneros' political orientation and strength have enabled them 
to play an effective legitimate role as well as an illegal one. Leftist Peronists, 
with Montonero support, fielded candidates in the recent Misiones provincial 
elections under the banner of the "Authentic Party." The Montoneros have 
also devoted much of their energy to supporting the wage demands of 
Peronist laborers through the surface organization of the Peronist Working 
Youth. Guerrilla support for these demands, and their related agitation, 
produced a widening cleavage between many of the rank and file and the 
union leaders who have tried to cooperate with the policies of Mrs. Peron's 
government. 
While participation in legal activities makes a guerrilla group vulnerable 
to charges of "bourgeois softness" and organizational laxity, it is not 
uncommon for extremists to try to work within the system. Even the ERP 
publicly agreed to a tentative "truce" with the government of Peron's 
surrogate, Hector Campora. Such an approach lends an aura of reasonable-
ness to the guerrilla cause and provides extremists with opportunities for 
recruitment among disillusioned adherents to ill-fated reformist causes. 
Excesses of Counterterrorism 
For almost six years, terrorist violence has been a major source of 
embarrassment for Argentine governments. Under President Lanusse, the

d'ITAL 
failure of security forces ta maintain order in the streets resulted in the 
formation of right-wing death squads whose extralegal operations were 
officially sponsored or at least countenanced by the military government. 
The Argentine Anti-Communist Alliance (AAA), which emerged in August 
1974, has achieved greater notoriety than its predecessors, but it represents 
merely a continuation of para-police activities against leftists that began as 
early as 1970. 
The Peronists continue to deny any association with the AAA, even 
though Lopez Rega, the power behind Mrs. Peron, is widely believed by the 
Argentine public to be its head. In fact, the AAA may not be a unified group 
but a collection of several uncoordinated terrorist bands consisting of off-
duty policemen, retired military officers, labor union "goons," and even 
criminals. An image of unity has been created, however, because all com-
muniques are issued in the name of the AAA. 
The frequent linking of Lopez Rega's name to the AAA has caused 
many observers to wonder why he has not been assassinated by the leftist 
extremists. Ironically, however, the overreactive nature of the AAA makes 
the leftists look good by comparison. In fact, because Lopez Rega is 
generally viewed as "someone to hate," he is probably more vulnerable to an 
attack from Peronists or another politically respectable group that would 
want to get rid of this right-wing strong man who continually thwarts efforts 
to create national stability. 
Argentine leftist guerrillas are not indiscriminate in their use of ter-
rorism. They have always restricted their targets to identified political 
enemies: policemen, army officers, business leaders, and foreign diplomats. 
Even the kidnaping and assassination of honorary US Consul John Egan 
could be justified in terms of terrorist propaganda, on the grounds that the 
Argentine government was unable to secure Egan's release because it had 
murdered or disfigured by torture the individuals demanded as ransom. 
En contrast, the counterterrorists have threatened or murdered several 
prominent liberal members of society not linked in any known way to the 
guerrillas. Popular singers, actors, writers, university professors, and even 
congressmen have been placed on AAA death lists for supposedly being 
intellectual purveyors of Marxism. The use of such lists, coupled with 
sadistic ritual assassinations, is effective in cowing many who might con-
ceivably support leftist activities, but it has also dissipated popular support 
for the government and threatens to undermine the President's constitu-
tional authority. Moreover, the administration's inability to cope with major 
economic and social issues makes the guerrillas important and dangerous 
political actors.

Prospects 
Sustained violence has already had a corrosive effect on Mrs. Peron's 
government. The preoccupation with terrorism and the left-right splits 
within the Peronist labor movement have prevented government officials 
from focusing effectively on economic and political problems. Military 
leaders have condoned Lopez Rega's meddling in security affairs, despite 
their stated objections to his influence, largely because of his hard-line 
position toward the left. Ironically, it is Lopez Rega who has handicapped 
efforts to improve the efficiency of the police force by promoting incom-
petent sycophants to positions of authority. The failure of Mrs. Peron and 
Lopez Rega to conciliate militants within the Peronist labor movement has 
enabled the Montoneros to exploit union unrest. 
Argentina is probably destined for an army coup sooner rather than 
later. And when it comes, the terrorists will escalate their attacks to cause as 
much disorder as possible. During the past year, force increasingly has 
supplanted reasoned debate in the political arena, and armed confrontation 
has taken the place of efforts to reconcile dissenters. The Peronists and other 
political parties have once again failed to lead the nation. 
In Argentina today, terrorism is a political catalyst that initiates a 
vicious cycle of terror and counterterror. Repression rarely produces revolu-
tion, but it can lead to the collapse of consensus and a loss of faith in 
democratic ideals.
