 CONCERNING MARXISM IN LINGUISTICS
 A group of younger comrades have Basked me
 to give my opinion in the press on problems relat-
 ing to linguistics, p~articuliarly in reference to
 Marxism in linguistics. i yam not ,a linguistic ex-
 pert  and,  of course,  cannon fully satisfy the
 request of the comrades. As to Marxism in lin-
 guistics, as in other social sciences, this is some-
 thing directly in my field. I have therefore con-
 sented to answer a number of questions pit by
 the comrades.
 QUESTION. Is it true that language is a
 superstructure on the basis?
 ANSWER. No, it 'is not true.
 The basis is the economic structure of society
 at the given stage of its development. The super-
 structure is the political, legal, religious, artistic,
 philosophical views of, society and the polit-
 ical, legal and. other institutions corresponding
 to them.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 Every basis has its own corresponding super-
 structure. The basis of the feudal system has its
 superstructure,  'its political,  legal  and other
 views, and the corresponding institutions;  the
 capitalist basis has its own superstructure, so has
 the socialist basis. If the basis changes or is
 eliminated, then, following this, its superstruc-
 ture changes or is eliminated;  if a new basis
 arises, then, following this, ~a superstructure arises
 corresponding to it.
 In this respect language radically differs from
 the superstructure. Take, for example, Russian
 society and ?the Russian language. In the course
 of the past thirty years the old, capitalist basis
 has been eliminated in Russia and a new, social-
 ist basis has been built. Correspondingly, the
 superstructure on the capitalist basis has been
 eliminated and ~a new superstructure created cor-
 responding to the socialist basis. The old political,
 legal and other institutions, consequently, have
 been supplanted by new, socialist institutions.
 But in spite of this the Russian llangu!age has re-
 mained basically what it was before the October
 Revolution.
 What has change.d 'in the Russian language
 in this period? To a certain extent the vocabulary
 of the Russian language has changed, in the
 sense ithaf. it has been replenished with ~a consid-
 erable number of new words land expressions,
 which have arisen in connection with the rise of
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108/11: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 the new socialist production, the ~appearnance of
 a new state, a new socialist culture, new social
 relations and morals, and, lastly, 'in connec-
 tion with the development of technology and
 science; a number of words and expressions have
 changed their meaning,  have acquired a new
 signification; a number of obsolete words have
 dropped out of the vocabulary. As to the basic
 stock of words and the grammatical system 'of the
 Russian language, which constitute the foundia-
 tion of a language, they, rafter the elimination of
 the capitalist basis, far from having been elimi-
 nated and supplanted by ~a new basic word stock
 and ~a new grammatical system of the la'nguiage,
 have been preserved in their entirety and have
 not undergone zany serious changes-they have
 been preserved precisely as the foundation of the
 modern Russian language.
 Further, the superstructure is a product of the
 basis, but this by no means implies that it mere-
 ly reflects the basis, that .it is passive, neutral,
 indifferent to the fate of its basis, to the fate of
 the classes, to the character of the system. On the
 contrary, having come into being. it becomes an
 exceedingly active force, actively assisting its
 basis to take shape !and consol;id~ate itself, and
 doing its utmost to help the new system tto finish
 off and eliminate the old basis and the old classes.
 It cannot be otherwise. The superstructure is
 created by the hasi~ precisely in order to serve it,
 to lactively help it to take shape sand consolidate
 itself, to actively fight for the elimination of the
 old, moribund basis togeTher with its old super-
 structure. 'Fhe superstructure has only to re-
 nounce this role of auxiliary, it has only to pass
 from a position of active defence of its basis to
 one of indifference towards it, to adopt an equal
 attitude to gall classes, and 'it loses its virtue and
 ceiases to be a superstructure.
 In this respect liangutage radioally differs from
 the superstructure. Language is not ~a product of
 one or another basis, old or new, within the given
 society, but of the whole course of the history
 of the society and of the history of the bases for
 many centuries. It was created not by some one
 crass, but by the entire society, by all The classes
 of the society, by the efforts of hundreds of gener-
 ations. It was created for the satisfaction of the
 needs not of one particular crass, bust of the
 entire society, of all the classes of the society.
 Precisely for this reason it was created as a
 single language for the society, common to gall
 members of that society, as the common lan-
 guage of The whole people. Hence the functional
 role of language, as is means of intercourse be-
 tween people, consists not in serving one crass to
 the detriment of other classes, but in equally serv-
 ~irig the entire society, all the classes of society.
 This in fact explains why a language may equally
 serve both The old, moribund system and the new,
 m
 rising system; both the old basis and the new
 basis; both the exploiters and the exploited.
 It is no secret to anyone that the Russian
 language served Russian capitalism and Russian
 bourgeois culture before the October Revolution
 just as well as it now serves the socialist system
 and socialist culture of Russian society.
 The same must be said of the Uknainiian, Bye-
 lorussi'an, Uzbek, 1i(azakh, Ceorgitan, Armenian,
 Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Moldavian, Tatar,
 Azerbaijanian, Biashkirian, Turkmenian sand other
 languages of the Soviet nations; they served the
 old, bourgeois system of these nations just as
 well as they serve the new, socialist system.
 It cannot he otherwise. Language exists, lan-
 guage has been created precisely in order to serve
 society as ~a whole, !as ta means of 'intercourse be-
 tween people, in order to be common to the mem-
 bers of society and constitute the single language
 of society, serving members of society equally,
 irrespective of their crass status. A language has
 only to depart from this position of being ~a lan-
 guage common to the whole people, it has only
 to give preference and support to some one social
 group to the detriment of other social groups of
 the society, and it loses its virtue, ceases To be la
 m pans of intercourse between the people of
 the society, and becomes the jargon of some
 social  group, degenerates =and is doomed to
 disappear.

 In this respect, while it differs in principle
 from the superstructure, language does not differ
 from instruments of production, from machines,
 let us say, which are as indifferent to classes as
 is Ian,guage and may, like it, equally serve a capi-
 talist system and is socialist system.
 Further, the superstructure 'is the product of
 one epoch, the epoch in which the given economic
 basis exists sand operates. The superstructure is
 therefore short-lived; it is eliminated sand disap-
 pears with the elimination and 'disappear!ance of
 the given basis.
 Langutage, on the contrary, is the product of
 a whole number of epochs, in the course 'of which it
 takes shape, is enriched, develops and is smooth-
 ened. A language therefore lives immeasurably
 longer than any basis or any superstructure. This
 in fact explains why the rise and elimin,aition not
 only of one basis and its superstructure, but of
 several buses and their corresponding superstruc-
 tures, have not led in history to the elimination
 of a given language, to the elimination of its
 structure and the rise of a new language with
 a new stock of words 'and a new grammatical
 system.
 It is more than ~a hundred years since Pushkin
 died. In this period the feudal system and the
 capitalist system were eliminated in Russia, sand
 a third, a socialist system has arisen. Hence two
 bases, with their superstructures, were elimi-
 12
 nated, and a new, soci~aFist basis has arisen, with
 its new superstructure. Yet, if we take the Rus-
 sian language, for example, 'it has not in this
 long spun of time undergone any fundamental
 change, and the modern Russian liangu,age differs
 very little in structure from the language of
 Pushkin.
 What has changed in the Russian language in
 this period? The Russian vocabulary has 'in this
 period been greatly replenished; a large number
 of obsolete words have dropped out of the vooab-
 uliary; the meaning of a great many words has
 changed; the grammatical system of the language
 has improved. As to the structure of Pushkin's
 language, with its grammatical system and its
 basic stock of words, in all essentials it has
 remained as the basis of modern Russ'itan.
 And this is quite understandable. Indeed, what
 necessity is there, rafter every revolution, for the
 existing structure of the language, its grammat-
 ical system and basic stock of words to be de-
 stroyed sand supplanted by new ones, as is usually
 the case with the superstructure? What object
 would  there be in calling "water,"  "earth,"
 "mountain," "forest," "fish," "man," "to walk "
 "to do,  "to produce," "to trade," etc., not water,
 earth, mountain, etc., but something else? What
 object would there be in having the modification
 of words in a language and the combination of
 words  in  sentences  follow  not  the  existing
 13

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 griamm~ar, but some entirely different grammar?
 What would the revolution gain from such an up-
 heaval in language? History in general never does
 anything of any importance without some special
 necessity for it. What, one asks, can be the neces-
 sity for such a linguistic revolution, if it has been
 demonstrated that the existing language and its
 structure tare fundamentally quite suited to the
 needs of the new system? The old superstructure
 can and should he destroyed and replaced by a
 new one in the course of a few years, in order to
 give free scope for the development of the pro-
 ductive forces of society; but how can an existing
 language be destroyed and a new one built in its
 pliace in the course of a few years without caus-
 ing anarchy in social life and without creat-
 ing the threat of the disintegration of society?
 Who but ;a Don Quixote could set himself such
 a task?
 Lastly, one other nadical distinction between
 the superstructure and language. The superstruc-
 ture is not directly connected with production,
 with man's productive activity. It is connected
 with production only indirectly, through the econ-
 omy,  through  the  basis.  The  superstructure
 therefore reflects changes in the level of develop-
 ment of the productive forces not immediately and
 not directly, but only after changes in the basis,
 through the prism of the changes wrought in the
 basis by the changes in production. This means
 11
 that the sphere of action of the superstructure is
 narrow and restricted.
 Language, on the contrary, is connected with
 man's productive activity directly, and not only
 with man's productive activity, but with all his
 other :activity in all his spheres of work, from pro-
 duction to the basis, and from the basis to the
 superstructure. For this reason language reflects
 changes in production immediately and directly,
 without waiting for changes in the basis. For
 this reason the sphere of Faction of Language,
 which embraces all fields of man's activity, is far
 broader :and more comprehensive than the sphere
 of ;action of the superstructure. More, it is prac-
 tically unlimited.
 It is this that primarily explains why lan-
 guage, or rather its vocabulary, is in ~a state of
 almost constant change. The continuous develop-
 ment of industry and agriculture, of trade and
 transport, of technology and science, demands
 that Language should replenish its vocabulary
 with new words and expressions needed for their.
 functioning. And  language,  directly reflecting
 these needs, does replenish its vocabulary with
 new words, and perfects its grammatical system.
 Hence:
 a) A Marxist cannot regard language as a
 superstructure on the basis;
 b) To confuse language and superstructure is
 to commit a serious error.

 QUESTION. Is it true that language always
 was and is class language, that there is no such
 thing as language which is the single and com-
 mon language of a society, a non-class language
 common to the whole people?
 ANSWER. No, it is not true.
 It is not difficult to understand that in a so-
 ciety which has no classes there can be no such
 thing gas to class language. There were no classes
 in the primitive communal clan system, and con-
 sequently there could be no cltass language-the
 language was then the single and common Lan-
 guage of the whole community. The objection that
 the concept class should be taken as covering
 every human community, including the primitive
 communal community, is not an objection but ,a
 playing with words that is not worth refuting.
 As to the subsequent development from clan
 languages to tribal liangu:ag'es, from tribal Tan-
 guages to the languages of nationalities, rand
 from the languages of nationalities to national
 bangnages-everywhere and  at gall stages of
 development,  language, as a means of inter-
 course between the people of to society, was the
 common Land single language of that society,
 serving it's members equally, irrespective of their
 social status.
 I tam not referring here to the empires of the
 slave Land mediaeval periods, the empires of Cyrus
 16
 or Alexander the Great, let us say, or of Caesar
 or Char,es the Great, which had no economic
 foundations of their own ,and were transient and
 unstable military and ~administrative associations.
 Not only did these empires not have, they could
 not have had a single language common to the
 whole empire and understood by all the members
 of the empire. They were conglomerations of
 tribes and nationalities, each of which lived its
 own rife and had its own language. Consequently,
 it is not these or similar empires I have in mind,
 but the tribes sand nationalities composing them;
 which had 'their own economic foundations 'and
 their own languages, evolved in the distant past.
 History tells us that the languages of these tribes
 and nationalities were not class languages, but
 languages common to the whole of a tribe or na-
 tionality, and understood by all its people.
 Side by side with this, there were, of course,
 dialects, local vernaculars, but they were domi-
 nated by and subordinated to the single and com-
 mon '.,anguage of the tribe or nationality.
 Later, with the appearance of capitalism, the
 elimination of feudal division and the formation
 of national markets, nationalities developed into
 nations, and the languages of nationalities into
 national languages. History shows that national
 languages are not class, but common languages,
 common to tall the members of each nation

 and constituting the single 1!anguage of that
 nation.
 It has been said above that language, as ~a
 means of intercourse between the people of ~a so-
 ciety, serves all classes of society equally, and in
 this respect displays what may be called an in-
 difference to classes. But people, the various so-
 ciial groups, the classes, iarL fear from being indif-
 ferent to langu!age. They strive to utilize the l;an-
 guiage in their own interests, to impose their own
 special lingo, their own special terms, their own
 special expressions upon it. The upper strata of
 the propertied classes, who have divorced them-
 selves from and detest the people-the aristocratic
 nobility, the upper strata of the bourgeoisie-
 particularly distinguish themselves in this re-
 spect. "Class" dialects, jargons, high-society "lan-
 guiages" ;are created. These dialects and jargons
 are often incorrectly referred to ?in literature as
 languages-the "aristocratic language" or the
 "bourgeois language" in contradistinction to the
 "proletarian  language" or the "peasant lan-
 guage." For this reason, strange as it may seem,
 some of our comrades have come to the conclusion
 that national language is a fiction, and that only
 class languages exist in reality.
 There is nothing, I think, more erroneous than
 this conclusion. Gan these dialects and jargons
 be regarded as languages? Certainly not, They
 cannot, firstly, because these dialects and jargons
 13
 have no grammatical systems or basic word
 stocks of their own-they borrow them from the
 national language. They cannot, secondly, be-
 cause these dialects and jargons are confined to a
 narrow sphere, are current only among the upper
 strata of a given class and are entirely unsuit-
 able as a means of human intercourse for society
 as a who:e. What, then, have they? They have a
 collection of specific words reflecting the specific
 tastes of the aristocracy or the upper strata of the
 bourgeoisie; a certain number of expressions 'and
 turns of phrase distinguished by refinement and
 gallantry and free 'of the "coarse" expressions
 and turns of phrase of the national language;
 lastly, a certain number of foreign words. But all
 the fundamentals, that is, the overwhelming ma-
 jority of the words and the grammatical system,
 are borrowed from the common, national lan-
 guage.  Dialects sand jargons are therefore off-
 shoots of the common national language, devoid
 of all linguistic independence and doomed to
 stagnation. To believe that dialects and jargons
 can develop into independent languages capable
 of ousting and supplianting the national language
 means losing one's sense of historical perspective
 and abandoning the Marxist position.
 References are made to Marx, and the passage
 from his :article "St. Max" is quoted which says
 that the bourgeois have "their own language," that
 this language "is a product of the bourgeoisie,"
 19
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108/11: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 that it is permeated with the spirit of mer-
 cantilism  and huckstering.  Certain comrades
 cite this passage with the idea of proving that
 Marx believed in the "crass charactser" of lan-
 guage and denied the existence of a single na-
 tional language. If these comrades were im-
 partial, they should have cited another p~assiage
 from this same article "St. Max," where Marx,
 touching on the ways single national languages
 arose, speaks of "the concentration of dialects
 into a single national language resulting from
 economic and political concentration."
 Marx, consequently, did recognize the neces-
 sity of a single national language, as a higher
 form, to which dialects, as lower forms, are sub-
 ordinate.
 What, then, can this bourgeois language be
 which Marx says "is a product of the bour-
 geoisie"? Did Marx consider it as much ;a Lan-
 guage ;as the national language, with a specific
 linguistic structure of its own? Could he have
 considered it such a language? Of course not.
 Marx merely wanted to say that the bourgeois
 had polluted the single national language with
 their hucksters' lingo, that the bourgeois, in other
 words, have their hucksters' jargon.
 It thus appears that these comrades have mis-
 represented Marx. And they misrepresented him
 because they quoted Marx not like Marxists but
 20
 21
 like dogmatists, without delving into the essence
 of the matter.
 References are made to Engels, and the words
 from his The Condition of the Working-Class in
 England are cited where he says that in Britain
 "... the working-class has gradually become a
 race wholly apart from the English bourgeoisie,"
 that "the workers speak other dialects, have other
 thoughts and ideals, other customs and moral
 principles, a different religion and other politics
 than those of the bourgeoisie." Certain comrades
 conclude from this passage that Engels denied
 the necessity of a common, national language,
 that he believed, consequently, in the "class char-
 acter" of language. True, Engels speaks here of
 dialects, not languages, fury realizing that, being
 an offshoot of the national language, a dialect
 cannot supplant the national language. But ~ap-
 p!arently, these comrades regard the existence of
 a 'difference between a language and a di~aleot
 with no particular enthusiasm....
 It is obvious that the quotation is inappro-
 priate, because Engels here speaks not of "class
 languages" but chiefly of class thoughts, ideals,
 customs, moral principle, religion, politics. Itt is
 perfectly true that the thoughts, ideals, customs,
 moral principles,  religion and politics of bour-
 geois and proletarians are directly antithetical.
 But what has this to do with national language,
 or the "class character" of language? Can the

 existence of class antagonisms in society serve
 as an ;argument in favour of the "cl:ass character"
 of language, or against the necessity of a single
 nnationa: language? Marxism says that .a common
 language is one of the cardinal ear-marks of a
 nation, although knowing very well that there are
 class antagonisms within the nation. Do the
 comrades  referred  to  recognize this  Marxist
 thesis?
 References are made to Lafargue, sand it is
 said that in his pamphlet The French Language
 Before and After the Revolution he recognizes
 the "class character" of language and denies the
 necessity of a national Language common to the
 whole people. That is not true. LTafargue does in-
 deed speak of a "noble" or "aristocratic lan-
 guage" and of the "jargons" of various strata of
 society. But these comrades forget that LTafargue,
 who was not interested in the difference between
 languages and jargons and referred to dialects
 now as "artificial languages," now as "jargons,"
 definitely says in this pamphlet that "the :artifi-
 cial language which distinguished the aristocracy
 . arose out of the language common to the
 whole people, which was spoken both by bour-
 geois and !artisan, by town and country."
 Consequently. Lafargue recognizes the exist-
 ence and necessity of a common language of the
 whole people, and fully realizes that the "aris-
 tocratic language" and other dialects and jargons
 22
 I
 subordinate to ,and dependent on the language
 common to the whole people.
 lit follows that the reference to Lafargue 7s
 wide of the mark.
 References are made to the fact that at one
 time in England the feudal lords spoke "for cen-
 turies" in French, while the English people spoke
 English; and this is alleged to be an argument in
 favour of the "class character" of language and
 against the necessity of a language common to
 the whole people. But this is not an argument,
 it is rather an anecdote. Firstly, not all the feu-dal
 lords spoke French at that time, but only a small
 upper stratum of English feudal lords attached
 to the court and at county seats. Secondly, it was
 not some "class language" they spoke, but the
 ordinary language common to all the French
 people. Thirdly, we know that in the course of
 time this  French  language  fad  disappeared
 without a trace, yielding place to the English
 language common to the whole people. Do these
 comrades think that the English feudal lords "for
 centuries" held intercourse with the English peo-
 ple through interpreters, that they did not use the
 English t:anguage, that there was no language
 common to all the English at that time, and that
 the French Language in England was then any-
 thing more than the language of high society,
 current only in the restricted circle of the upper
 English aristocracy? How can one possibly deny

 the existence and the necessity of a language
 common to the whose people on the basis of ~anec-
 dotic "arguments" like these?
 There was a time when Russian aristocrats at
 the tsar's court and in high society also made a
 fad of the French language. They prided them-
 selves on the fact that when they spoke Russian
 they often lapsed into French, that they could
 only speak Russian with a French accent. Does
 this mean that there was no Russian language
 common to the whole people at that time in Russia,
 that a language common to the whole people
 was a fiction, and "class languages" a reality?
 Our comrades are here committing at least
 two mistakes.
 The first mistake is that they confuse language
 with  superstructure. They think that since the
 superstructure has ~a class character, language
 too must be a class language, and not a language
 common to the whose people. But I have already
 said that language and superstructure are two
 different concepts, and that a Marxist must not
 confuse them.
 The second mistake of these comrades is that
 they conceive the opposition of interests of the
 bourgeoisie and the proletariat, the fierce class
 struggle between them, as meaning the disinte-
 gration of society, as a break of all ties between
 the hostile classes. They believe that, since so-
 ciety has disintegrated Land there is no longer a
 24
 25
 single society, but only c.~asses, a single language
 of society, a national language, is unnecessary. If
 society has disintegrated sand there is nolonger
 to language common to the whole people, is na-
 tional language, what remains?  There remain
 classes and "class languages." Naturally, every_
 "class l.angu:age" will 'have its "class" gramniiar
 --a "pro~etari;an" grammar or a "bourgeois"
 grammar. True, such grammars do not exist ~any-
 where. But that does not worry these comrades:
 they believe that such grammars will appear in
 due course.
 At one time there were "Marxists" in our
 country who asserted that the railways left to us
 after the October Revolution were bourgeois rail-
 ways, that it would be unseemly for us Marxists
 to use them, that they should be torn up and new,
 "proletarian" railways built. For this they were
 nicknamed "troglodytes"... .
 It goes without saying that such a primitive-
 anarchist view of society, of classes, of language.
 has nothing in common with Marxism. But it un-
 doubted:y exists and continues to prevail in the
 minds of certain of our muddled comrades.
 It is of course wrong to say that, because of
 the existence of a fierce class struggle, society has
 split up into classes which are no longer econom-
 ically connected with one ranother in one society.
 On the contrary, as long as oapital;ism exists, the
 bourgeois and the proletarians will be bound

 together by every economic t'hrea'd as parts of ia
 single capitalist society. The bourgeois cannot
 Live sand enrich themselves unless they have wage-
 Labourers iat their command; the proletarians can-
 not survive unless they hire themselves Ito the cap-
 italists. If 'all economic ties between them were
 to cease, it would' mean the cessation of all pro-
 duction, and the cessation of .all production would
 mean the doom of society, the doom of the crasses
 themselves. Niatur~ally, no class wants to incur
 self-destruction. Consequently, however sharp the
 class struggle may be, it cannot lead to the disin-
 tegration 'of society. Only ignorance of Marxism
 sand complete failure to understand the nature of
 Language could have suggested to some of our
 camriades the fairy-tale 'about the disintegration
 of society, 'about "crass" 'lianguiages, and "class"
 grammars.
 Reference is further made to Lenin, and it is
 pointed out that Lenin recognized the existence
 of two cultures under capitalism-bourgeois and
 proletarian---.and thiat the slogan of national cul-
 ture under capitalism is a nationalist slogan. All
 this is 'true and Lenin is absolutely right here.
 But what has this to do with the "crass charac-
 ter" of language? When these comrades refer to
 what Lenin said about two cultures under capi-
 talism, it is evidently with the idea of suggesting
 to the reader that the existence of two cultures.
 bourgeois land proletarian, in society means that
 26
 2T
 there must also be two languages, inasmuch as
 language is linked with culture-+and, conse-
 quently, that Lenin denies the necessity of ~a sin-
 g'.e national Language, and, consequently, that
 Lenin 'believes in "class" languages. The mistake
 these comrades m:aloe here is thatthey identify
 and confuse language with culture. But culture
 and language are two different things. Culture
 may be bourgeois or socialist, but language, as a
 means of intercourse, is always a hangu~age com-
 mon to the whole people and can serve both bour-
 geois Land socialist culture. Is it not ~a fact that
 the Russian, the Ukrainian, the Uzbek languages
 are now serving the socialist culture of these
 nations just as well as they served their bourgeons
 cultures before the October Revolution? Conse-
 quently, these comrades are profoundly mistaken
 when they assert that the existence of two differ-
 ent cultures leads'to the formation 'of two different
 languages Sand to the negation of the necessity
 of a single language.
 When Lenin spoke of two cultures, he pro-
 ceeded precisely from the thesis that the existence
 of two cultures cannot lead to the negation of is
 single languiage and to the formation of two Ian
 gu~ages, that there must be ia single ?languiage.
 When the Bundists `accused Lenin of denying the
 necessity of ~a national language and of regard-
 ing culture as "non-national," Lenin, as we know,
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108/11: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 vigorously protested ?and declared that he was
 fighting  against  bourgeois  culture,  and  not
 against national   languages, the  necessity of
 which he regarded as indisputable. It is stnange
 that some of our comrades should be trailing in
 the footsteps of the Bundists.
 As to a singe language, the necessity of which
 Lenin is ialleged to deny, it would be well to pray
 heed to the following words of Lenin:
 "Language is the most important means of
 hum:an intercourse. Unity of Iiangu'age rand its
 unimpeded development form one of the most im-
 portant conditions for genuinely free rand exten-
 sive commercial intercourse appropriate to mod-
 ern capitalism, for a free rand broad grouping of
 the population in all its separate classes."
 It follows that our highly respected comnades
 have misrepresented the views of Lenin.
 Reference, lastly, is made to Stalin. The pias-
 sage from Stalin is quoted which says that "the
 bourgeoisie sand its nationalist parties were and
 remain in this period the chief directing force of
 such nations." This is all true. The bourgeoisie
 and its nation+alist party really do direct bour-
 geois culture, just gas the proletariat and  its  in-
 ternationalist party direct proletarian culture.
 But what has this to do with the "class chanac-
 ter" of language? Do not these comnades know
 that nattiomal language is ra form of national cul-
 ture, that ra national language may serve both
 2&
 bourgeois rand socialist culture? Are our comrades
 unaware of the well-known formula of the Marx-
 ists that the present Russian, Ukrainian, Byelo-
 russian and other cultures are socialist in con-
 tent and national in form, i.e., in language? Do
 they ;agree with this Marxist formula?
 The mistake our comrades commit here is that
 they do not see the difference between culture and
 i:angu'age,  and do not understand that culture
 changes in content with every new period in the
 development of society, whereas language re-
 mains basically the same through a number of
 period's, equally serving both the new culture sand
 the old.
 Hence:
 a) Language, as ~a means of intercourse, al-
 ways was and remains the single language of ~a
 society, common to all its members;
 b) The existence of dialects and jargons does
 not negate but confirms the existence of a lan-
 guage common to the whole of the given people,
 of which they ,are offshoots and to which they are
 subordinate;
 c) The "crass chanacter" of Language formula
 'is rerroneous and non-Marxist.
 QUESTION. What are the characteristic fea-
 tures o F language?
 ANSWER. Language is one of those social
 phenomena which operate throughout the existence
 29

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 of a society. It arises land  develops with the
 rise ,and development of +a society. It dies when
 the society dies. Apart from society there is no
 llangua.ge. Accordingly, liangu+age and its laws of
 development can be understood only if studied
 in inseparable connection with the history of so-
 ciety, with the history of the people to whom the
 language under situdy belongs, and who are its
 creators and reposiories?
 L+angu+age is +a medium, an instrument with
 the help of which people communicate with one
 another, exchange thoughts and understand each
 other. Being directly connected with thinking,
 language registers and fixes in words, and in
 words combined into sentences, the results of the
 process of thinking and achievements of m+an's
 cognitive +activity, and thus makes possible the
 exchange of thoughts in human society.
 Exchange of thoughts is a constant and vital
 necessity, for without it, it is impossible to co-
 ordinate the joint ;actions of people in the struggle
 against the forces of nature, in the struggle to
 produce the necessary m:ateri+al values; without it,
 it is impossible to ensure the success of society's
 productive activity, and, hence, the very existence
 of social production becomes impossible. Conse-
 quently, without +a language understood by a so-
 ciety and common to all its members, that society
 must cease to produce, must disintegnate and
 cease to exist +as ~a society. In this sense, Lan-
 30
 gu,age, while it i:s a medium of intercourse, its at
 the same time an instrument of struggle +and
 development of society.
 As we know, all the words in a language taken
 together constitute what is known as its vocabu-
 lary. The chief thing in the vocabulary of a lan-
 guage is its basic stock of words, which includes
 also all the root word's, as its kernel. It is liar less
 extensive than the 1+anguage's vocabulary, but it
 persists for a very long time, for centuries, and
 provides the language with a basis for the Iorm~a-
 tion of new words. The vocabulary reflects the
 state of the language: the richer +and more diver-
 sified the vocabulary, the richer and more de-
 veloped the l~angu+age.
 However, by itself, the vocabulary does not
 constitute the language-it 'is rather the building
 material of the language. Just as in construction
 work the building materials do not constitute the
 building, ;although the latter cannot be construct-
 ed without them, so too the vocabulary of ;a Lan-
 guage does not constitute the language itself,
 although no Language is conceivable without it.
 But the vocabulary of a Language assumes tre-
 mendous importance when it comes under the
 control of grammar, which defines the rules gov-
 erning the modification of words +and the combi-
 nation of words into sentences, and thus makes
 the l+anguage ~a coherent and significant function.
 Grammar (morphology, syntax) is the collection
 31
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108/11: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 of rules governing the modification of words and
 their combination into sentence's. It is therefore
 thanks to grammar that it becomes possible for
 Languwage to invest mean's thoughts in a material
 linguistic integument.
 The distinguishing feature of grammar is that
 it gives rules for the modification of words not in
 reference to concrete words, but to words in gen-
 eral, not taken concretely; that it gives rules for
 the formation of sentences not in reference to
 particular concrete sentences-with, let us say, a
 concrete subject, a concrete predicate, etc.-but
 to all sentences in general, irrespective of the con-
 crete form of any sentence in particular. Hence,
 ~abstracting itself, as regards both words and sen-
 tences, from the particular and concrete, gram-
 mar takes that which is common and basic in the
 modification of words and their combination into
 sentences and builds 'it into gnammatic:ai rules,
 grammtatioal haws. Grammar is the outcome of a
 process of ~abstraction performed by the human
 mind over a long period of time; it is an indica-
 tion of the tremendous achievement of thought.
 In this respect grammar resembles geometry,
 which in giving its laws abstracts itself from
 concrete objects, regarding objects  as bodies
 devoid of concreteness, and defining the relations
 between them not gas the concrete relations of
 concrete objects but as the relations of bodies in
 general, devoid of gall concreteness.
 32
 Unlike the superstructure, which 'is connected
 with production not directly, but through the
 economy, language is directly connected with
 man's productive activity, as well as with all his
 other activity in all his spheres of work without
 exception. That is Why the vocabulary of ~a lan-
 guage, being the most sensitive to change, is in
 a state of almost constant change, sand, unlike
 the superstructure, language does not have to
 wait until the basis. is eliminiated, but makes
 changes in its vocabulary before the basis . is
 eliminrated and irrespective of the state of the
 basis.
 However, the vocabulary of a language does
 not change 'in the way the superstructure does,
 that is, by ;abolishing the old and building some-
 thing new, but by replenishing the existing vocab-
 ulary with new words which arise with changes
 in the social system, with the development  of
 production,  of culture,  science, etc. Moreover,
 ialthough is certain number of obsolete words
 usually drop out of the vocabulary of a liangaage,
 a fear Larger number of new words are added. As
 to the basic word stock, it is preserved in all its
 fundamentals and is used as the basis for the
 vooabuliary of the language.
 This is quite understandable. There is no ne-
 cessity to destroy the basic word stock when it
 can be effectively used through the course of sev-
 eral historical periods; not to speak of the fact

 that, it being impossible to create ta new basic
 word stock in ~a short time, the destruction of the
 basic word stock accumu:ated in the course of
 centuries would result in p;analysis of the itan-
 guiage, in the complete disruption of intercourse
 between people.
 The  grammatical  system  of  a lianguiage
 changes even more slowly than its basic word
 stock. Elaborated in the course of epochs, and
 having become part of the flesh .and blood of the
 liangutage, the grammatical system changes still
 more slowly than the basic word stock. With the
 lapse of time it, of course, undergoes changes,
 becomes more  perfected, improves its  rules,
 makes them more specific sand acquires new rules;
 but the fundamentals of ithe grammatical system
 are preserved for is very long time, since, as his-
 tory shows, they are able to serve society effec-
 tively through a succession of epochs.
 Hence, grammatical system and basic word
 stock constitute the foundation of language, the
 essence of its specific character.
 History shows that languages possess great
 stability and a tremendous power of resistance
 to forcible lassimilation. Some historians, instead
 of explaining this phenomenon,  confine them-
 selves to expressing their surprise :at it. But there
 is no reason for surprise whatsoever. Languages
 owe their stability to the stability of their gram-
 matical systems sand basic word stocks. The
 34
 Turkish assimilators strove for hundreds of years
 to mutilate, shatter and destroy the languages of
 the Balkan peoples. During this period the vo-
 cabuliary of the B~a:kan languages underwent
 considenable change; quite a few Turkish words
 and expressions were absorbed; there were "con-
 vergencies" sand "divergencies." Nevertheless, the
 Balkan languages held their own and survived.
 Why? Because their gnamm:atical systems and
 basic word stocks were in the mein preserved.
 It follows from gall this that a language, its
 structure, cannot be regarded gas the product of
 some one epoch. The structure of a language, its
 grarnmatiaal system and basic word stock, is
 the product of ~a number of epochs.
 We m,ay assume that the rudiments of modern
 language already existed in hoary antiquity, be-
 fore the epoch of slavery. It was ta rather simple
 language, with a very meagre stock of words, but
 with ?a grammatical system 'of its own-true, ia
 primitive one, but a grammatical system none-
 theless.
 The further development of production, the
 appearance, of classes, the introduction of writing,
 the rise of the spate, which needed ~a more or less
 well-regulated correspondence for its administration, the development of trade, which needed
 a well-regulated correspondence still more, the
 appearance of the printing press, the develop-
 ment of literature-all this caused big changes
 31i                                    35

 in the development of l~angu;age. During this time,
 tribes Land nationalities broke up and 5ca~tter' d,
 intermingled and intercrosse.d; later there iarose
 national languages and. states, revolutions took
 place, and old social systems were replaced by
 new ones. All this caused even greater changes
 in language and its development.
 However, it would be is profound mistake to
 think that language developed in the way the
 superstructure developed-by the destruction of
 that which existed and the building of something
 new. In point of fact, languages did not develop
 by the 'destruction of existing languages sand the
 creation of new ones,  but  u    extending but by   xtendin        a
 ?~        ?,g and per-
 fecting the basic elements of existing languages.
 And the tnarnsit'ion of the language from one
 quality to another did not take the form of an
 explosion, of the destruction at one blow of the
 old and the creation of the new, but of the grad-
 ual and long-continued accumulation of the ele-
 m'ents of the new quality, of the new linguistic
 structure, and the gradual dying away of the
 elements of the old quality.
 It  is  said   that   the   theory   that that the theory   ll~a~  lan ffu;a yes
 develop by stages is a Marxist theory, since it
 recognizes the necessity of sudden explosions as
 a condition tar the transition of a language from
 an old quality to a new. This is of course untrue
 for it is difficult to find  anything  resembling
 Marxism 'in this  theory. And if the theory of
 Sanitized
 stages really does recognize sudden explosions
 in the history of the development of languages,
 so much rthe worse for that theory. Marxism does
 not recognize sudden explosions in the d'ev'elop-
 ment of languages, the )sudden death of an exist-
 ing Languiage and the sudden erection of ~a new
 language. Lafargue was wrong when he spoke
 of is "sudden linguistic revolution which took
 place between 1789 and 1794" 'in Fnance  (see
 Uatargue's p:amphiet The French Lan ua.e Be-
 tore and After the Revolution). There was no
 linguistic revolution, let alone ~a sudden one, in
 Fnance at that time True enough, during that
 period the vocabulary of the French Language
 was replenished with new words and expressions,
 ta certain number of obsolete words dropped out
 of it, and the meaning of certain words changed
 -but that was all. Changes of this nature, how-
 ever, by no means determine the destiny of is Lan-
 guage. The chief thing in a Language is its gram-
 matical system sand basic ward stock. But far
 from disappearing in the period of the French
 bourgeois revolution,  the gnammatioai  system
 and basic word stock of the French language:
 were preserved without substantial change, and
 not only were they preserved, but they continue
 to exist in the French language of to-day. I need
 hardly say that five or six years is a ridiculously
 small period for the eliminahion of an existing
 i'angu;age land the building of a  new national

 language ("ia sudden linguistic revolution"!)-
 centuries pare needed for this.
 Marxism holds that the transition of a lan-
 guage from an old quality to ~a new does not take
 place by way of an explosion, of the destruction
 of an existing Language and the creation of ;a new
 one, but by the gnadual ;accum 'lation of the ele-
 ments of the new quality, and hence by the
 gnadual dying away of the elements of the old
 quality.
 It should be said in general for the benefit of
 comrades who have an infatuation for explosions
 that the law of transition from an old quality to
 a new by means of an explosion is inapplicable
 not only to the history of the development of lan-
 gnages; it is not always applicab:e to other social
 phenomena of a basis 'or superstructural char-
 acter. It !applies of necessity to ~a society divided
 into hosti:e classes. But it does not necessarily
 apply to ia society which h!aS no hostile classes.
 In a period of eight to ten years we effected a
 years
 transition in the !agriculture 'of our country from
 the bourgeois, individual-peasant system to the
 socialist, collective-farm system. This was ;a rev-
 olution which eliminated the old bourgeois eco-
 nomic system in the countryside and created 'a
 new, s?ociialist system. But that revo:ution did not
 take place by means of an explosion, that is, by
 the overthrow of the existing government power
 and the creation of a new power, but by a gradual
 38
 trransition from the old bourgeois system in the
 countryside to a new system. And it was possible
 to do thiat because it was a revolution from
 above, because the revolution was accomplished
 on the initiative of the existing power with the
 support of the bulk of the peasantry.
 It is said that the numerous instances of lin-
 guistic crossing in past history furnish reason to
 believe that when languages cross a new lan-
 guage is formed by means of ian explosion, by is
 sudden transition from an old quialfly to a new.
 This is quite wrong.
 Linguistic crossing cannot be regarded as the
 single impact of a decisive blow which produces
 its results within a few years. Linguistic crossing
 is a proonged process which continues for'hun-
 dreds of years. There can therefore be no ques-
 tion 'of explosion here.
 Further, it would be quite wrong to think
 that +the crossing of, slay, two l:anguiages results
 in a new, third language which does not resemble
 either of the  l~anguiages crossed  and differs
 qualitatively from both of them. As ;a mutter of
 fact one of the languages  usually  emerges
 victorious from the cross, retains  its gnam-
 miatical system and its basic word stock and
 continues to develop in accordiance with 'its in-
 herent laws of development, while the other
 language gradually loses its quality and grad-
 ually dies away.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 Consequently, ~a cross does not result in some
 new, third language; one of the languages per-
 sists, retains its gnamm,at'ical system and basic
 word stock and is able to develop in accordance
 with its inherent laws of development.
 True, in the process the vocabulary of the
 victorious language is somewhat enriched from
 the vanquished language, but this strengthens
 rather than weakens it.
 Such was the case, for instance, with the Rus-
 sian language, with which, in he course of his-
 torical development, rthe languages of a number
 of other  peoples  crossed and which  always
 emerged the victor.
 Of course, in the process the vocabulary of the
 Russian language was enlarged at the expense
 of the vocabularies of the other languages, but
 far from weakening, this enriched and strength-
 ened the Russian language.
 As to the specific national individuality of the
 Russian language, it did not suffer in the slight-
 est, because the Russian l:angu'age preserved its
 grammatical system sand basic word stock and
 continued to advance and perfect itself inaccord-
 ance with its inherent laws of development.
 There can be no doubt that the crossing theory
 has little or no value for Soviet linguistics. If :it is
 true that the chief task of linguistics is to study
 the inherent laws of language development, it has
 to be admitted that the crossing theory does not
 40

 even set itself this tusk, let Malone accomplish it-it
 simply dues not notice it, or does not understand it.
 QUESTION. Did "Pravda" act rightly in start-
 ing an open discussion on problems of linguistics?
 ANSWER. Yes, 'it did.
 Along what lines the problems of linguistics
 will be settled, will become clear at the conclu-
 sion of the discussion. But it may be said already
 that the discussion has been very useful.
 It has brought out, in the first place, that in
 linguistic bodies both in the centre sand in the
 republics a regime has prevailed which is alien
 to science and men of science. The slightest crit-
 icism of the state of affairs in Soviet linguistics,
 even the most timid attempt to criticize the so-
 called "new  doctrine" in linguistics, was  per-
 secuted and suppressed by the leading linguistic
 circles. \ alu,able workers and researchers in lin-
 guistics were dismissed from their posts or de-
 noted for being critical of N. Y. Marr's heritage
 or expressing the slightest disapproval of his
 teachings. Linguistic scholars were appointed ito
 leading posts not on their merits, but because of
 their unqualified acceptance of N. Y. Marr's
 theories.
 It is generally recognized that no science can
 develop and flourish without ~a b:attle of opinions,
 without freedom of criticism. But this generally
 recognized rude was ignored +and flouted in the
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108/11: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 11
 most unceremonious fashion. There Larose is close
 group of infallible leaders, who, 'having secured
 themselves against any possible criticism, became
 ea law unto themselves sand did whatever they
 pleased.
 To give one example: the so-called "Baku
 Course"  (lectures delivered by N. Y. Marr in
 Baku), which the author himself head rejected and
 forbidden to be republished,  was  republished
 nevertheless by order of this leading caste (CQm-
 r~ade Meshchaninov calls them "disciples"                             of
 N. Y. Marr) ~an'd included without any reserva-
 ti'ons in the list of text-books recommended to
 students. This means that the students were de-
 ceived, a rejected "Course" being suggested to
 them gas a sound text-book. If I were not 'con-
 vinced of the inhegrity of Comrade Mes'h?chaninov
 and the other linguistic leaders, I would say that
 such conduct is tantamount to 5iabotage.
 How could this 'have happened? It happened
 because the Arakcheyev regime established in
 linguistics culti\Pates irresponsibility and encour-
 ages such arbitrary actions.
 The discussion has proved to be very useful
 first of all because ;it brought this Anakoheyev
 regime into the light of day and smashed it to
 smithereens.
 But the usefulness of the discussion does not
 end there. It not only smashed the ol.d regime in
 linguistics but also brought out the incredible
 42
 43
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108/11: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 confusion of 'ideas on cardinal questions of lin-
 guistics which prevails among the .leading circles
 in this branch of science. Until the discussion
 began the "disciples" of N. Y. Marr kept silence
 and glossed over the unsatisfactory state of iaf-
 fairs in linguistics. But when the discussion
 started silence became impossible, and they were
 compelled to express their opinion in the press.
 And what did we find? It turned out that in N. Y.
 Marr's teachings there pare a whole number of
 defects, errors, ill-defined problems land sketchy
 propositions. Why, one asks, .have N. Y. Marr's
 "disciples" begun to talk about this only now,
 rafter the discussion opened? Why did they not see
 to it before? Why did they not speak about 'it in
 due time openly sand honestly, as befits scientists?
 Having admitted "some" errors of N. Y. Marr,
 his "disciples," it ;appears, think that Soviet lin-
 guistics can only be advanced on the basis of a
 "rectified" version of N. Y. Marr's theory, which
 they consider a Marxist one. No, save us from
 N. Y. Marr's "Marxism"! N. Y. Marr did indeed
 want to be, and endeavoured to be, ~a Marxist, but
 he failed to become one. He was nothing but is
 simplifier 'and vu'.gar.izer 'of Marxism, similar to
 the "proletcultists" or the "R~appists."
 N. Y. Marr introduced into linguistics, the in-
 correct, non-Marxist formula that language is ta.
 superstructure, and got himself into a muddle
 and put linguistics into ia muddle. Soviet linguis-
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 tics cannot be advanced on the basis of an incor-
 rect formula.
 N. Y. Marr introduced into 'liguistics another
 and ialso incorrect and non-Marxist formula, re-
 garding the "class 'ch:aracter" of language, and
 got himself into ?a muddle sand put linguistics into
 a muddle. Soviet linguistics cannot be advanced
 on the basis of an incorrect formula which is
 contrary to the whole course of the history of
 peoples sand liangutages.
 N. Y. Marr introduced into linguistics pan im-
 modest, boastful, arrogant tone alien to Marxism
 ,and tending towards a bald sand oft-hand nega-
 tion of 'everything done in linguistics prior to
 N. Y. Marr.
 N. Y. Marr shrilly abused the comp:anative-
 historical method ias "idealistic." Yet it must be
 said that, despite its serious !shortcomings, the
 comp.anative-historical  method     is      nevwer  hele
 u1~,1l.JJ
 better than N. Y. Marr's really idealistic four-
 element analysis, because the former gives a
 st'i'mulus to work, to is study of languages, while
 the latter only gives a stimulus to loll in one's
 Farm-chiair sand tell fortunes in the tea-cup of the
 celebrated four elements.
 N. Y. Marr haughtily discountenanced every
 attempt to study groups (families) of languages
 on the grounds that it was a manifestation of the
 "linguistic prototype" theory. Yet it cannot be
 denied .that the linguistic affinity of nations like
 44
 the Slav nations, spay, is beyond question, and
 that is study of the linguistic affinity of these na-
 tions might be of great value to linguistics in the
 study of the laws of language development. The
 "linguistic prototype" theory, I need hardly spay,
 has nothing to 'do with it.
 To listen to N. Y. Marr, and especially to
 his "disciples," one might think that prior to
 N. Y. Marr there was no 'such thing !as the science
 of languwage, that the science of language iap-
 peared with the "new doctrine" of N. Y. Marr.
 Marx and Engels were much more modest: they
 held that their dialectical ?mater'ialism was  a
 product of the 'development 'of the sciences, in-
 clufding philosophy, in earlier periods.
 Thus, the discussion was useful also because
 it brought to light ideological shortcomings in
 Soviet linguistics.
 I think that the sooner our linguistics rids it-
 self of N. Y. Marr's errors, the sooner will it be
 possible to extricate it from its present crisis.
 Elimination of the Arakcheyev regime in lin-
 guistics, rejection of N. Y. Marr's errors, and the
 introduction of Marxism into lingu.isti'cs-{that, in
 my opinion, is the way in which Soviet linguis-
 tics could be put on :a sound basis.

 CONCERNING CERTAIN
 PROBLEMS OF LINGUISTICS
 Reply to Comrade E. Krasheninnikova
 Comrade Irasheninnikova,
 I am answering your questions.
 1. QUESTION.  Your  iarticl'e  convincingly
 shows that language is neither the basis nor the
 superstructure. Would it be right to regard lan-
 guage gas ~a phenomenon characteristic of both
 the basis ,and the superstructure, or would it be
 lilure cUI rel;i.  iU i    di U  l:ai1gutage as tan  lnl~l iut-
 diate phenomenon?
 ANSWER. Of course, characteristic of ban-
 guiag'e, as a social phenomenon, is that common
 feature which is inherent in all social phenomena,
 including the basis and the superstructure, name-
 ly: it serves society just tas society is served by
 gall other social phenomena, including the basis
 and the superstructure. But this, properly speak-
 ing, exchiausts that common feature which is in-
 herent iin all social phenomena. Beyond this, im-
 46
 portiant distinctions begin between social phe-
 nomena.
 The point is that soaciial phenomena have, in
 addition to this common feature, their own spe-
 cific features which 'd.istinguis'h them from each
 other and which are of primary importance for
 science. The specific features of the basis consist
 in that it serves society economically. The specific
 features of the superstructure consist in that it
 serves society by means of political, legal, aes-
 thetic sand other ideas and provides society with
 corresponding political, legal and other institu-
 tions. What then pare the specific features of lian-
 gnage, distinguishing it from other social phe-
 nomena? They consist in that language serves
 society as a means of intercourse between people,
 as ~a means for exchanging thoughts in society,
 as ;a means enabling people to understand one
 another   and    f Cv o    nn LV-'vtiiordinatl   joint t   work k    111   all

 l'1
 spheres of human activity, both in the sphere of
 production and in the sphere of economic rela-
 tions, both in the sphere of politics and in the
 sphere of culture, both in social life and in every-
 day .life. These specific features are characteristic
 only of banguage, ;and precisely because they pare
 characteristic only of language, language is the
 object of study by tan independent science-lin-
 guistics. If there were no such specific features of
 language, linguistics would lose its right to 'in-
 dependent existence.
 47

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 In brief: language cannot be included either
 in the category of bases or in the category of
 superstructures.
 Nor can it be included 'in +the category of "in-
 termediiate" pihenomeriia between the basis and
 the superstructure, for such "intermediate" phe-
 nomena do not exist.
 But perhaps language could be 'included in the
 category of the productive forces of society, in the
 category, say, of instruments of production? In-
 deed, there does exist a certiain ~analogy between
 language and instruments of production: instru-
 ments of production manifest, just as language
 does, ta kind of indifference towards classes and
 can serve equally different classes of  society,
 both o'.d and new. Does this +circumstance provide
 ground for including lfan.guage in the category
 of instruments ?of production? No, it does not.
 At one time, N. Y. Marr, seeing that his for-
 mula-"lianguiage is ~a superstructure on the ba-
 sis"-encountered  objections,  decided to "re-
 shape" it sand +announced that "Language is an
 instrument of production." Was N. Y. Marr right
 in including language in the category of instru-
 ments of production? No, she certainly was not.
 The point is that the similarity between Lan-
 guage and instruments of production ends with
 the analogy I have just mentioned. But, on the
 other hand, there is ~a r+adical difference between
 language sand instruments of production. This dif-
 48
 ference lies in the fact that whereas instruments
 of production produce m:ateriial wealth, language
 produces nothing or "produces" words only. To
 put it more plainly, people possessing instru-
 ments of production can produce material wealth,
 but those very ~siam'e people, 'if they possess ~a lan-
 guage but not instruments of production, cannot
 produce material wealth. It is not difficult to see
 that were language ?cap+able of producing mate-
 rial wealth, wind-bags would be the richest men
 on earth.
 2. QUESTION. Marx and Engels define lan-
 guage as "the immediate reality of thought,'=,as
 "practical, ...  actual consciousness." "Ideas,"
 Marx says, "do not exist divorced  from lan-
 guage." In what measure, in your opinion, should
 linguistics occupy itself with the semantic +aspect
 of language.  6eman~tics,  historical    .i    :::uviViV`I historical  s. ernasiology
 -____.____. ~,.,
 and stylistics, or should form Malone be the sub-
 ject of linguistics?
 ANSWER. Semantics (semtasiology) is one of
 the important branches of linguistics. The se-
 mantic aspect of words and expressions is of
 serious importance in the study of Language.
 Hence, semantics (semasiology) must be assured
 its due place in linguistics.
 However, in working on problems of seman-
 tics and in utilizing its data, its significance must
 in no way be over-estimated, and still less must

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 it be abused. I have in mind certain philologists
 who, having an excessive passion for semantics,
 disregard language as "the immediate reality of
 thought" inseparably connected with thinking,
 divorce thinking from                  language and miaint,ain
 that language is outliving its ?age and that itt is
 possible to do without language.
 Listen to what N. Y. Marr nays:
 "Language exists only inasmuch as 'it is ex-
 pressed in sounds; the action of thinking occurs
 also  without  being  expressed....  Language
 (spoken) has already begun to surrender its func-
 tions to the latest inventions which are unre-
 servedly conquering space, while thinking is on
 the up-grade, departing from its unutilized accu-
 mulations in the past and its new acquisitions,
 and is to oust and fully replace language. The
 language of the future is thinking which will be
 dnrrplnnino'  in  ferhnlnlle  free of natural matter:
 No language, even the spoken language, which is
 'al.l the same connected with the standards of
 nature, will be ;able to withstand it" (see  elected
 Works by N. Y. Marr).
 If we interpret this "Labour-magic" gibberish
 into simp'.e human language, the conclusion may
 be drawn hat:
 ia) N. Y. Marr divorce's thinking from lan-
 guage;
 b) N. Y. Miarr considers that communication
 between people can be realized without language,
 with the help of thinking itself, which is free of
 the "natural matter" of :l,anguiage, free of the
 s'tiandards of nature";
 c) divorcing thinking from  Language sand
 "having freed" it from the "natural matter" of
 language, N. Y. Marr bands into the swamp of
 idealism.
 It is said that thoughts arise in the mind of
 man prior to their be in g ex pressed in speech,
 that they arise without linguistic material, with-
 out linguistic integument, 'in, so to say, a naked
 form. But that is absolutely wrong. Whatever
 thoughts arise in' the human mind and at what-
 ever moment, they can Parise and exist only on the
 basis of the linguistic material, on the basis of
 language terms and phrases. Bare thoughts, free
 of the linguistic material, free of the "natural
 matter" of language, do not exist. "Language is
 +L,      immnr~'    +                 li+Tr   ..~   +~n11rr4-"     (/Ifcvr%\       Ti--

 reality of thought is                         manifested in Language.
 Only idealists can speak of thinking not being
 connected with "the natural matter" of language,
 of thinking without language.
 In brief: over-estimation of semantics                                             and
 abuse of it led N. Y. Marr to idealism.
 Consequently, if semantics (sem,asiology) is
 safeguarded ~against exaggerations sand abuses of
 the kind committed by N. Y. Marr and some of
 his "disciples," semantics can be of great benefit
 to linguistics.

 3. QUESTION. You quite justly say that the
 ideas, concepts, customs and moral principles of
 the bourgeoisie and those of the proletariat are
 directly iant'ithetical. The class chianacter of these
 phenomena is certainly reflected in the semantic
 aspect of language (and sometimes in its form-
 in the vocabulary-+as is correctly pointed out in
 your particle). In +analyzing concrete linguistic
 material sand, .in the first place, the semantic ias-
 pect of language, can we speak of the class es-
 sence of the concepts expressed by language, piar-
 ticularly in those cases when language expresses
 not only the thought of man but iaiso his attitude
 towards reality, where 'his class affinity manifests
 itself with especial clarity?
 ANSWER. Putting   lit   more briefly, you want
 to know whether  classes  influence ?lianguage,
 whether they introduce into language their spe-
 cific words and expressions, whether there are
 oases when people attach ~a different meaning to
 one and the same word or expression depending
 on their class affinity?
 Yes, classes influence language, introduce into
 the language their own specific words and ex-
 pressions and sometimes underst~ind one and the
 same word or expression differently. There is no
 doubt +about that.
 However, it does not follow that specific words
 and expressions, as well  as  difference in sernan-
 i   J      t.t   u i,
 52
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108/11: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 tics, can be of serious importance for the develop-
 ment of ~a single language common to the whole
 people, ith;at they are capable of detracting from
 its significance or of changing its character.
 Firstly, such specific words +and expressions,
 as well as cases of difference in semantics, are so
 few in language that they hardly make up even
 one per cent of the entire linguistic material.
 Consequently, all the remaining overwhelming
 mass of words and expressions, as well as their
 semantics, are common to all classes of society.
 Secondly, specific words and expressions with
 a class tinge are used in speech not according to
 rules of some sort of "class" grammar, which
 does not exist, but according to the grammatical
 rules of the existing lianguiage common to the
 whole people.
 Hence, the existence of specific words sand ex-
 pressions sand the facts of differences in the se-
 ili'anucs  01 language ?uo  nol  reiuie.  DuL,  on   [Ile
 contrary, confirm the existence and necessity of
 a single language common to the whole people.
 4. QUESTION. In your +article you quite cor-
 rectly appraise Marr as a vulgarizer of Marxism.
 Does this mean that the linguists, including us,
 the young linguists, should reject the whole
 linguistic heritage of M;arr, who all the same has
 to his credit a number of valuable linguistic re-
 searches (Comrades. Chikobav:a, Sanzheyev and
 53
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 others wrote about them during the discussion) ?
 Approaching Marr critically, cannot we take from
 him wheat i5 useful and valuable?
 ANSWER. Of course, the works of N. Y. Marr
 do not consist solely of errors. N. Y. Marr made
 very gross mistakes when he introduced into lin-
 guistics elements of Marxism in a distorted form,
 when he tried to create an independent theory of
 Ianguiage. But N. Y. Marr has certain goad and
 ably written works, in which he, forgetting his
 theoretical claims, conscientiously and, one must
 say, skilfully investigates 'individual languages.
 In these works one aan find not 'a little that is
 valuable sand instructive. Clearly, these valuable
 and instructive things should be taken from
 N. Y. Marr and utilized.
 5. QUESTION. Many linguists consider for-
 malism one of the main causes of the stiagna-
 tion in Soviet linguistics. We should very much
 like to know your opinion as to what formalism
 in linguistics consists in and how it should be
 overcome?
 ANSWER. N. Y. Marr :and his "disciples"
 accuse of "formalism" all linguists who do not
 accept the "new doctrine" of N. Y. Marr. This
 of course is not serious or clever.
 N. Y. Marr considered that grammar is an
 empty "forrna?l.ity," sand that people who regard
 54
 the grammatical system as' he foundation of lan-
 guage, are formalists. Thi& is altogether foolish.
 I think that "formalism" was invented by the
 authors of the "new doctrine" to facilit;aite their
 struggle against their opponents in linguistics.
 The cause of the stagnation in Soviet lin-
 guistics is  not  the  "formalism"  invented  by
 N. Y. Marr and his "disciples," but the Arak-
 cheyev regime and the theoretical gaps in lin-
 guistics. The Arakcheyev regime was set up by
 the "disciples" of N. Y. Marr. Theoretical confu-
 sion was brought into linguistics by N. Y. Marr
 and his closest colleagues. To put an end to stag-
 nation, both the one and the other must be elimi-
 nated. The removal of these plague spots will put
 Soviet linguistics on ~a sound basis, will lead it
 out on to the broad highway and enable Soviet lin-
 guistics to occupy first place in world linguistics.

 REPLY TO COMRADES
 To Comrade Sanzheyev
 Dear Comnade Sanzheyev,
 I lam replying to your letter with considerable
 delay, for it was only yesterday forwarded to me
 from the ~app.anatus of the Central Committee.
 Your interpretation of my standpoint on the
 question of diasects is absolutely correct.
 "Crass" dialects, which it would be more cor-
 rect to call jargons, do not serve the mass of the
 people, but ~a narrow 5oci;al upper crust. More-
 over, they do not have a gnammatioal system or
 basic word stock of their own. in view of this,
 they cannot possibly develop into independent
 llangu:ages.
 Local  ("territorial") dialects, on the other
 hand, serve the mass of 'the people and have a
 grammatical system and basic word stock of their
 own. In view of this, some local dialects, in the
 process of formation of nations, may become the
 basis of national languages and develop into in-
 dependent national languages. This was the case,
 36
 for instance, with the Kursk-Orel dialect  (the
 Kursk-Orel "speech") of the Russian lianguiage,
 which formed the basis of the Russian national
 language. The same must be sari of the Poltava
 Kiev dialect of the Ukrainian language, which
 formed the basis of the Uknainiian national lan-
 guage. As for the other  dialects of such lan-
 guages, they lose their originality, merge with
 those liangutages sand disappear in them.
 Reverse processes also occur, when the singe
 language of a nationality, which has not yet be-
 come ia nation owing to the iabsence of the neces-
 sary economic conditions  of development, col-
 lapses as a result of the disintegnation of the
 state of that nationality, and the local dialects,
 which have not yet had time to be fully uniform-
 ized in the single language, revive and give
 rise to the formation of'sepiariate independent Lan-
 guages. Possibly, this was the case, for example,
 with the single Mongolian language.

 To Comrades D. Belkin and S. Furer
 I have received your ktters.
 Your mistake is that you have confused two
 different things and substituted another subject
 for that examined in my reply to Comrade Kra-
 sheninnikova.
 1. In that reply I criticized N. Y. Marr who,
 dealing with language  (spoken)  and thought,
 divorces language from thought and thus lapses
 into idealism. Therefore, I referred in my reply to
 normal human beings possessing the faculty of
 speech. I ?maint,ained, moreover, that with such
 human beings thoughts can Parise only on the ba-
 sis of linguistic material, that bare thoughts un-
 connected with linguistic material do not exist
 among people, who possess the faculty of speech.
 Instead of accepting or rejecting this thesis,
 you introduce anomalous human beings, people
 without language, deaf-mutes, who have no lan-
 gufage at their disposal .and whose thoughts, of
 course, cannot arise on Rhe basis of linguistic
 58
 material. As you see, this, is ;an entirely different
 subject which I did not touch upon and could not
 have touched upon, since linguistics concerns it-
 self with normal human beings possessing the
 faculty of speech ;and -not with anomalous deaf-
 mutes who do not possess the facu~ty of speech.
 You have substituted for the subject under
 discussion another subject that was not dis-
 cussed.
 2. From Comrade Belkin's letter it is evident
 that he places on a par the "language of words"
 (spoken  Llanguage)  and  "gesture  language"
 ("hand" language, according to N. Y. Marr). He
 seems to think that gesture 1~anguiage ,and the
 language of words are of equal significance, that
 at one time human society had no language of
 words, that "hand" language at that rime played
 the part of the Language of words which appeared
 later.
 But if Comrade Belkin really thinks so, he is
 committing ~a serious error. Spoken language or
 the language of words has always been the sole
 language of human society capable of serving as
 an ;adequate means of initercourse between peo-
 p:e. History does not know of ;a single human
 society, be it the most backward, that did not
 have its own spoken language. Ethnography does
 not know of a single backward tribe, be it as
 primitive or even more primitive rthan, say, the
 Austnalians or the Tierra del Fuegans of the bast
 o*

 century, which did not have its own spoken l~an-
 guiage. In the history of mankind, spoken Lan-
 guage h!as been one of the forces which helped
 human beings to emerge from the animal world,
 unite into communities, develop ibheir faculty of
 thinking, organize social production, wage a
 successful struggle against the forces of mature
 and attain the stage of progress we have to-id~ay.
 In this respect, ithe significance of the so-
 called gesture Language, in view of its extreme
 poverty and limitations, us negligible. Properly
 speaking, this is not a language, and not even a
 linguistic substitute that could in one way or
 another replace spoken language, but ian auxil-
 iary means of extremely limited possibilities to
 which man sometimes resorts to emphasize this
 or that point in his speech. Gesture language and
 spoken language are just as incompanable as are
 the primitive wooden hoe and the modern cater-
 pillar tnactor with its five-furrow plough  or
 tractor row drill.
 3. Apparently, you pare primarily interested
 in the deaf-mutes, and only secondarily in prob-
 lems of linguistics. Evidently, it was precisely
 this circumstance that prompted you to put a
 number of questions to me. Well, 'if you insist,
 I am not averse to gnamting your request. How
 do matters stand with regard to deaf-mutes? Do
 they possess the fiacu?Ity .of thinking? Do thoughts
 arise with them? Yes, they possess the faculty of
 60
 thinking and thoughts arise with ahem. Clearly,
 since deaf-mutes are deprived of the fiaculty of
 speech, their thoughts cannot arise on the basis
 of linguistic material. Gan this be taken to mean
 that the thoughts of deaf-mutes pare naked, are
 not connected with the "standards of mature"
 (N. Y. Marr's expression) ? No, it cannot. The
 thoughts of deaf-mutes arise land can exist only
 on the basis of the images, sensations ;and con-
 ceptions they form in every-day life on the objects
 of the outside world ~and' their relations -among
 themselves, thanks to the senses of sight, of
 touch, taste, and smell. Apart from these im-
 ages, sensations and conceptions, thought is
 empty, is deprived of all content, that is, it does
 not exist.

 To Comrade A. Kholo pov
 I have received your letter.
 Pressure of work has somewhat delayed my
 reply.
 Your letter tacitly proceeds from two prem-
 ises: from the premise that it is permissible to
 quote the work of this or that author apart
 from the historical period of which the quotation
 treats, and second:y, from the premise that this
 or that conclusion or formula of Marxism, de-
 rived as a result of studying one of the periods of
 historical development, holds good for all periods
 of  development  and  therefore  must  remain
 invariable.
 I must 'say that both these premises are deeply
 mistaken.
 A few examples.

 there was no monopoly capitalism as yet, when

 Marx and Engels concluded that a socialist revo-

 country, that it could be victorious only !as a re-

 However, at the beginning of the twentieth

 It is evident thtat here we have two different
 conclusions on the question of the victory of
 socialism, which not only corntnadict, but exclude
 each other.
 Some dogmatists and talmudists who quote
 mechanically without delving into the essence of
 the matter, and apart from historical conditions,
 may say 'that one of these conclusions should be
 discharged as being absolutely incorrect, while the
 other conclusion, as the habsolutely correct one,
 should be applied to all periods of development.
 Marxists, however, cannot but know that the
 dogmatists and talmudists  are mistaken;  they
 cannot but know that both of these conclusions
 are correct, though not tabsolutely, each being
 correct for its own time: Marx's and Engels's con-
 clusion-for the period of pre-monopoly capital-
 ism; and Lenin's conclusion-for the period of
 monopoly capitalism.
 2. Engels 'in  his  Anfi-Duhring said  that
 after the victory of the socialist revolution, the
 state is bound to wither away. On these grounds,
 after the victory of the socialist revolution in our
 country, dogmatists and talmudists in our Party
 began demtanding that the Ptarty should   take
 steps to ensure the speedy withering iaway of our
 state, to disband state organs, to give up a stand-
 ing army.
 However, the study of the world situation of
 our time led Soviet Marxists to the conclusion
 that in the conditions of oapitalistt encirclement,
 when the socialist revolution has been victorious
 only in one country, and capitalism reigns in hall
 other countries, the hand of the victorious revolu-
 tion should  not  weaken,  but in every way
 strengthen its state, state organs, intelligence or-
 gans and Barmy, if that land does not want to be
 crushed by the capitalist encirclement. Russiian
 Marxists came to the conclusion that Engels's
 formula has in view the victory of socialism in gall,
 or in most, countries, that it cannot be applied
 in the case where socialism is victorious in one
 country taken separately Land capitalism reigns
 in all the other countries.
 Evidently, we have here two different formu-
 las regarding the destiny of the socitahist state,
 each formula excluding the other.
 The dogmatists and talmudists may say that
 this circumstance creates pan 'intolerable situa-
 tion, that one of these formulas must be discard-
 ed gas being absolutely erroneous, hand the other
 -tas the absolutely correct one-must be applied
 to gall periods of development of th'e socialist
 state. Marxists, however, cannot but know that
 the dogmLatists and talmudists are mistaken, for
 both these formultas are correct, though not ab-
 solutely, each being correct for its time: the for-
 mulia of Soviet Marxists--for the period of the
 victory of socialism in one or several countries;
 and the formula of Engels-for the period when
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108/11: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 the consecutive victory of socialism in separate
 countries will lead to the victory of socialism 'in
 the majority of countries and when the necessary
 conditions will thus have been created for the
 iapplioation of Engels's formulta.
 The number of such examples could be mul-
 rtipli.ed.
 The same must be said of the two different
 formulas on the question of language, taken from
 various works of Stalin and cited by Comrade
 Kholopov in his letter.
 Comrade 'Kholopov refers to Stalin's work
 "Concerning Marxism in Linguistics," where the
 conclusion is drawn that, as ~a result of the cross-
 ing, spay, of two iangu!ages, one of them usutally
 emerges victorious, while the other dies away,
 that, consequently, crossing does not produce
 some new, third language, but preserves one of
 the Languages. He refers further to another con-
 clusion, taken from Stalin's report to the Sixteenth
 Congress of the C.P.S.U. (B.) , where it is said
 that in the period of the victory of sociiali'sm on
 ia world scale, when socialism is consolidated and
 becomes part of every-day life, national  lan-
 guages will inevitably merge into one common
 Language which, of course, will be neither Great
 Russian nor German, but something new. Com-
 paring these 'two formulas sand seeing that, far
 from coinciding, they exclude each oth ~.~-, Com-
 rade Kholopov falls into despair. "From your
 66
 67
 article," he writes in his letter, "I understood
 that the crossing of languages can never pro-
 duce some  new  language, whereas  prior to
 your article I was firmly convinced, 'in conformity
 with your speech gat the Sixteenth Congress
 of the C.P.S.U.(B.), that under communism,
 languages would merge into one common Lan-
 guage."
 Evidently, having discovered a contradiction
 between these two formulas and being deeply
 convinced that the contradiction must be re-
 moved, Comrade Kholopov considers it necessary
 to get rid of one of these formulas as incorrect
 and to clutch at the other gas being correct for all
 periods sand countries; but which formula to
 clutch gat-he does not know. The result is some-
 thing in the nature of a hopeless situation. Com-
 rade Kholopov does not even suspect that both
 formulas can be correct-each. for its own time.
 Th:at is always the case with dogmatists and
 tialmudists who do not delve into the essence of
 the mutter, quote mechanically sand irrespective
 of the historical conditions of which the quota-
 tions treat, sand invariably find themselves uin ia
 hopeless situation.
 Yet if one examines the essence of the matter,
 there are no grounds for considering the situa-
 tion hopeless. The fact is that Stalin's pamphlet
 "Concerning  Marxism  in  Linguistics,"  sand
 Stalin's speech at the Sixteenth Party Congress,
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108/11: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 refer to two entirely different epochs, owing to
 which the formulas, too, prove to be different.
 The formula given by S't,alin in his pamphlet,
 in the part where it speaks 'of the crossing of
 languages, refers  to the  epoch prior to the
 victory of socialism on is world scale, when
 the exploiting classes are the dominant power
 in the world; when national sand oolonital oppres-
 sion remains in force; when national isoliat.ion
 and mutual   distrust among nations pare con-
 solidated by differences between states; when,
 as yet, there is no national equality of rights;
 when the crossing of languages takes place as ~a
 struggle for the domination of one of the lan-
 guages; when the conditions necessary for The
 peaceful ;and friendly co-operation 'of nations and
 languages are as yet lsacking; when it is not the
 co-operation  sand mutual  enrichment of lan-
 guages that are on the order of the day, but the
 ~assimiliation of some and the victory of other
 languages. It is clear that in such conditions
 there can be only victorious and defeated Lan-
 guagels. It is precisely these conditions that
 Stalin's formula has in view when it says that
 the crossing, say, of two languages, results not
 in the formation of a new language, but in the
 victory of one of the languages and the defeat of
 the other.
 As regards the other formula by Stalin, taken
 from his speech at the Sixteenth Party Congress,
 68
 in the part that touches on the merging of lan-
 guages into one common language, it has in view
 another epoch, namely, the epoch after the vic-
 tory of socialism on a world scale, when world
 imperialism no longer exists; when the exploit-
 ing  classes  tare  overthrown  and  national
 and colonial  oppression  is  eradicated; when
 national 'isolation sand mutual distrust among
 nations is replaced by mutual confidence and rap-
 prochement  between          nations;  when national
 equality has been put into practice; when the pol-
 icy of suppressing and assimilating languages is
 abolished; when the co-operation of nations has
 been established, sand it is possible for national
 languages freely to enrich one another through
 their co-operation. It is clear that in these condi-
 tions there can be no question of the suppres-
 sion and defeat of some languages, and the vic-
 tory of others. Herz we shall have not two lan-
 guages, one of which is to suffer defeat, while
 the other is to emerge from the struggle victori-
 ous, but hundreds of national languages, out of
 which, as is result of a prolonged economic, po-
 litical and cultural co-operation of nations, there
 will first appear most enriched unified zonial lan-
 guages, and subsequently the zonal languages
 will merge into ~a single international language,
 which, of course, will be neither German, nor
 Russian, nor English, but a new language that

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 has absorbed the best elements of the national
 and zonal itangu.ages.
 Consequent:y, the two different formulas cor-
 respond to two different epochs in 'the develop-
 ment of society,  sand precisely because they
 correspond to them, both formulas are correct--
 each for its epoch.
 To demand that these formulas should not be
 gat variance with each other, that they should not
 exclude each other, is just as :absurd as it would
 be to demand that the epoch of the domination
 of ctapittalism should not be gat variance with the
 epoch of the domination of socialism, that so-
 ci:arism land capita:ism should not exclude each
 other.
 The dogmatists and t,almudists regard Marx-
 ism sand separnate conclusions and formulas of
 Marxism tas a collection of dogmas, which "nev-
 er" change, notwithstanding changes in the con-
 ditions of the development of society. They be-
 'lieve that if they learn these conclusions and for-
 mulas by heart and 6t:art citing them at random,
 they will be able to solve any problem, reckoning
 that the memorized  conclusions and  formulas
 will serve them for all times sand countries, for
 gall occasions in life. But this can be the convic-
 tion only of people who see the letter of Marxism,
 but not it's essence, who learn by rote the texts
 of conclusions land formulas of Marxism, but do
 not understand their meaning.
 70
 Marxism is the science of the laws governing
 the development of nature and society, the science
 of the revolution of the oppressed and exploited
 masses, the science of the victory of socitaiism in
 all countries, the science of bui:ding communist
 society. As ta science, Marxism cannot stand
 still, 'it develops  and is perfected. In its de-
 vel'opment, Marxism cannot but be enriched by
 new experience, new knowledge-consequently
 some of its formu:as and conclusions cannot but
 change in the course of time, cannot but be re-
 placed by new formulas and conclusions, corres-
 ponding to  the new historical tasks. Marxism
 does not recognize invariable conclusions and
 formulas, obligatory for all epochs and periods.
 Marxism is the enemy of all dogmatism.

 PUBLISHER'S NOTE
 This translation of V. I. Lenin's The Tasks
 of the Youth Leagues has been made from the
 text  given  in  the            Collected  Works  of
 V. I. Lenin, Vol. 31, Fourth Russian Edition,
 prepared by the Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute
 of the Central Committee, C.P.S.U. (Gospolit-
 izdat, Moscow 1950).
 (The Congress  greets Lenin  with  a
 stormy ovation.)
 Comrades, I would like to discuss today
 the ;undamental tasks of the Young Com-
 munist League and, in this connection, what
 the youth organizations in a socialist repub-
 lic should be like in general.
 It is all the more necessary to deal with
 this question because in a certain sense it
 may be said that it is precisely the youth
 that will be faced with the real task of creat-
 ing a communist society. For it is clear that
 the generation of workers that was brought
 up in capitalist society can, at best, accom-
 plish the task of destroying the foundations
 of the old, capitalist 'social life, which was
 built on exploitation. At best, it can' accom-
 plish the task of creating a social system
 that would help the proletariat and' the toil-
 ing classes to retain power .and to .lay a

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 firm foundation, on which only the genera-
 tion that is starting to work under the new
 conditions, in a situation in which exploiting
 relations between men no longer exist, can
 build.
 And so, in approaching the tasks of the
 youth from this angle, I must say that the
 tasks of the youth in general, and of the
 Young Communist Leagues and all other or-
 ganizations in particular, may be summed
 up in one word: learn.
 Of course, this is only "one word." It
 does not answer the principal and most es-
 sential questions: what to learn, and how to
 learn? And the whole point here is that with
 the transformation of the old capitalist so-
 ciety, the teaching, training and education of
 the new generations that will create the
 communist society cannot be conducted on
 the old lines. The teaching, training and
 education of the youth must proceed from
 the material that has been left to us by the
 old society. We can build communism only
 from the sum of knowledge, organizations
 and institutions, only with the stock of hu-
 man forces and means that have been left
 to us by the old society. Only by radically
 remoulding the teaching, organization and
 training of the youth shalli we be able to en-
 sure that the efforts of the younger genera-
 p                                                                              tion will result in the creation of a society
 that will be unlike the old society, i.e., in the
 creation of a communist society. That is why
 we must deal in detail with the question of
 what we should teach the youth and how the
 youth should learn if it really wants to jus-
 tify the name of communist youth, and
 how it should be trained so as to be able to
 complete and consummate what we have
 started.
 I must say that the first and most natu-
 ral reply would seem to be that the Youth
 League, and the youth in general that want
 to pass to communism, should learn com-
 munism.
 But this reply-"learn communism"-
 is too general. What do we need in order to
 learn communism? What must be singled
 out from the sum of general knowledge to
 acquire a knowledge of communism? Here
 a number of dangers arise, which often
 manifest themselves whenever the task of
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108/11: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 learning communism is presented  incor-
 rectly, or when it is interpreted too one-
 sidedly.
 Naturally, the first thought that enters
 one's mind is that learning communism
 means imbibing the sum of knowledge that
 is contained in communist textbooks, pam-
 phlets and books. But such a definition of the
 study of communism would be too crude
 and inadequate. If the study of communism
 consisted  solely  in  imbibing  what  is
 contained in communist books and pam-
 phlets, we might all too easily obtain com-
 munist text-jugglers or braggarts, and this
 would very often cause us harm and dam-
 age, because such people, having learned by
 rote what is contained in communist books
 and pamphlets, would prove incapable of
 combining this knowledge, and would be
 unable to act in the way communism really
 demands.
 One of the greatest evils and misfor-
 tunes left to us by the old capitalist society
 is the complete divorcement of books from
 practical life; for we have had books in which
 everything was described in the best pos-
 sible manner, yet these books in the majori-
 ty of cases were most disgusting and hypo-
 critical lies that described capitalist society
 falsely.
 That is  why it would be extremely
 wrong merely to absorb what is written in
 books about communism. In our speeches
 and articles we do not now merely repeat
 what was formerly said about communism,
 because our speeches and articles are con-
 nected with our daily work in every branch.
 Without work, without struggle, an abstract
 knowledge of communism obtained from
 communist pamphlets and books would be
 absolutely worthless, for it would continue
 the old divorcement of theory from practice,
 that old divorcement which constituted the
 most disgusting feature of the old bourgeois
 society.
 It would be still more dangerous to start
 to imbibe only communist slogans. Had we
 not realized this danger in time, and had we
 not directed all our efforts to avert this
 danger, the half million or million young
 men and women who would have called
 themselves Communists after studying corn-

 munism in this way would only occasion
 great damage to the cause of communism.
 Here the question arises: how should we
 combine all this for the study of commu-
 nism? What must we take from the old
 school, from the old science? The old school
 declared that its' aim was to produce men
 with an all-round education, to teach the
 sciences in general. We know that this was
 utterly false, for the whole of society was
 based and maintained on the division of men
 into classes, into exploiters and oppressed.
 Naturally, the whole of the old school, being
 thoroughly imbued with the class spirit, im-
 parted knowledge only to the children of the
 bourgeoisie. Every word was falsified in the
 interests of the bourgeoisie. In these schools
 the  younger  generation of workers  and
 peasants were not so much educated as
 drilled in the interests of this bourgeoisie.
 They were trained in such a way as to be
 useful servants of the bourgeoisie, able
 to create profits for it without disturbing
 its peace and leisure. That is why, while
 rejecting the old  school, we have made
 it our task to take from it only what we
 require for real communist education.
 This brings me to the reproaches and ac-
 cusations which we constantly hear levelled
 at the old school, and which often lead to
 totally wrong conclusions. It is said that the
 old school was a school of cramming, grind-
 ing, learning by rote. That is true, but we
 must distinguish between what was bad in
 the old school and what is useful for us, and
 we must be able to choose from it what is
 necessary for communism.
 The old school was a school of cram-
 ming; it compelled pupils to imbibe a mass
 of useless, superfluous, barren knowledge,
 which clogged the brain and transformed
 the younger generation into bureaucrats reg-
 imented according to one single pattern.
 But you would be committing a great mis-
 take if you attempted to draw the conclusion
 that one can become a Communist without
 acquiring what human knowledge has ac-
 cumulated. It would be a mistake to think
 that it is enough to learn communist slo-
 gans, the conclusions of communist science,
 without acquiring the sum of knowledge of
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108/11: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 which communism itself is a consequence.
 Marxism is an example of how communism
 arose out of the sum of human knowledge.
 You have read and heard that commu-
 nist theory, the science of  communism,
 mainly created by Marx, that this teaching
 of Marxism has ceased to be the product of
 a single Socialist of the nineteenth century,
 even though he was a genius, and that it has
 become the teaching of millions and tens
 of millions of proletarians all over the world,
 who are applying this teaching in their
 struggle against capitalism. And if you
 were to ask why the teachings of Marx
 were able to capture the hearts of mil-
 lions and tens of millions of the most revo-
 lutionary class, you would receive only one
 answer: it was because Marx took his stand
 on the firm foundation of the human knowl-
 edge  acquired under capitalism. Having
 studied the laws of development of human
 society, Marx realized the inevitability of the
 development of capitalism leading towards
 communism. And the principal thing is that
 he proved this precisely on the basis of the
 most exact, most detailed and mot profound
 Jo
 study of this capitalist society, by fully as-.
 similating all that earlier science had pro-
 duced. He critically reshaped everything that
 had been created by human society, not
 ignoring a single point. Everything that had
 been created by human thought he reshaped,
 criticized, tested on the working-class move-
 ment, and drew conclusions which people
 restricted by bourgeois limits or bound by
 bourgeois prejudices could not draw.
 \\Te must bear this in mind when, for
 example, we talk about proletarian culture.
 Unless we clearly understand that only by
 an exact knowledge of the culture created
 by the whole development of mankind and
 that only by reshaping this culture can we
 build proletarian culture-unless we under-
 stand that we shall not be able to solve this
 problem. Proletarian culture is not some-
 thing that has sprung nobody knows whence,
 it is not an invention of people who call
 themselves experts in proletarian culture.
 That is all nonsense. Proletarian culture
 must be the result of a natural development
 of the stores of knowledge which mankind
 U
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108/11: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 has accumulated under the yoke of capi-
 talist society, landlord society, bureaucratic
 society. All these roads and paths have led,
 are leading, and continue to lead to prole-
 tarian culture, in the same way as political
 economy, reshaped by Marx, showed us
 what human society must come to, showed
 us the transition to the class struggle, to
 the beginning of the proletarian revolution.
 When we so often hear representatives
 of the youth and certain advocates of a new
 system of education attacking the old school
 and saying that it was a school of cram-
 ming, we say to them that we must take
 what was good from the old school. We must
 not take from the old school the system of
 loading young people's minds with an im-
 mense amount of knowledge, nine-tenths of
 which was useless and one-tenth distorted.
 But this does not mean that we can confine
 ourselves to communist conclusions and
 learn only communist slogans. You will not
 create communism that way. You can be,
 come a Communist only when you enrich
 your mind with the knowledge of all the
 treasures created by mankind;
 12
 We do not need cramming; but we do
 need to develop and perfect the mind of ev-
 ery student by a knowledge of the funda-
 mental facts. For communism would become
 a void, a mere signboard, and a Communist
 would become a mere braggart, if all the
 knowledge he has obtained were not digest-
 ed in his mind. You must not only assimi-
 late this knowledge, you must assimilate it
 critically, so as not to cram your mind
 with useless lumber, but enrich it with all
 those facts that are indispensable to the
 modern man of education. If a Communist
 took it into his head to boast about commu-
 nism on the basis of the ready-made conclu-
 sions he had acquired, without putting in a
 great deal of serious and hard work, without
 understanding the facts which he must ex-
 amine critically, he would be a very deplo-
 rable Communist. Such superficiality would
 be decidedly fatal. If I know that I know
 little, I shall strive to learn more; but if
 a man, says that he is a Communist and
 that he need know nothing thoroughly, he
 will never be anything like a Communist.
 The old school turned out servants need-

 ed by the capitalists; the old school trans-
 formed men of science into men who had
 to write and say what pleased the capital-
 ists. Therefore we must abolish it. But does
 the fact that we must abolish it, destroy it,
 mean that we must not take from it all that
 mankind has accumulated that is essential
 for man? Does it mean that we do not have
 to distinguish between what was necessary
 for capitalism and what is necessary for
 communism?
 We are replacing the old drill-sergeant
 methods that were employed in bourgeois
 society in opposition to the will of the major-
 ity by the class-conscious discipline of the
 workers and peasants, who combine hatred
 of the old society with the determination,
 ability and readiness to unite and organize
 their forces for this fight, in order to trans-
 form the wills of millions and hundreds of
 millions of people, disunited, dispersed and
 scattered over the territory of a huge coun-
 try, into a single will; for without this single
 will defeat is inevitable. Without this solidar-
 ity, without this conscious discipline of the
 workers and peasants, our cause will be hope-
 14
 less. Without this we shall not be able to
 beat the capitalists and landlords of the
 whole world. We shall not even consolidate
 the foundation, let alone build a new, com-
 munist society on that foundation. Similarly,
 while rejecting the old school, while cherish-
 ing an absolutely legitimate and essential
 hatred for the old school, while prizing the
 readiness to destroy the old school, we must
 realize that in place of the old system of tui-
 tion, the old cramming, the old drill, we must
 put the ability to acquire the sum of human
 knowledge, and to acquire it in such a way
 that communism shall not be something
 learned by rote, but something that you
 yourselves have thought over, that it shall
 embody the conclusions which are inevitable
 from the standpoint of modern education.
 That is the way we must present the main
 tasks when speaking of the task of learning
 communism.
 In order to explain this to you, and as an
 approach to the question of how to learn, I
 shall take a practical example. You all know
 that following immediately on the military
 tasks, the tasks of defending the republic,
 15
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108/11: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 we are now being confronted with economic
 tasks. We know that communist society can-
 not be built unless we regenerate industry
 and agriculture, and they must not be regen-
 erated in the old way. They must be regen-
 erated on a modern basis, in accordance
 with the last word in science. You know that
 this basis is electricity, and that only when
 the whole country, all branches of industry
 and agriculture have been electrified, only
 when you have mastered this task will you
 be able to build for yourselves the communist
 society which the older generation cannot
 build up. Confronting you is the task of eco-
 nomically reviving the whole country, of re-
 organizing and restoring both agriculture
 and industry on a modern technical basis
 which rests on modern science and technol-
 ogy, on electricity. You realize perfectly well
 that illiterate people cannot tackle. electrifi-
 cation, and that mere literacy is not enough
 either. It is. not enough to understand what
 electricity is; it is necessary to know how to
 apply 't technically to industry and to agri-
 culture, and to the various branches of in-
 dustry and agriculture. We. must learn this
 16
 ourselves, and must teach it to the whole
 of the growing generation of toilers. This is
 the task that confronts every class-conscious
 Communist, every young person who re-
 gards himself a Communist and who clearly
 understands that by joining the Young Com-
 munist League he has pledged himself to
 help the Party build communism and to
 help the whole younger generation create
 a communist society. He must realize that
 he can create it only on the basis of modern
 education; and if he does not acquire this
 education communism will remain only an
 aspiration.
 The task of the old generation was to
 overthrow the bourgeoisie. The main task
 then was to criticize the bourgeoisie, to
 arouse hatred of the bourgeoisie among the
 masses, to develop class consciousness and
 the ability to unite their forces. The new
 generation is confronted with a much more
 complicated task. Not only have you to com-
 bine all your forces to uphold the power of the
 workers and peasants against the attacks
 of the capitalists. That you must do. That
 you have clearly understood; that the Corn-
 17
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108/11: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 munist distinctly perceives. But it is not
 enough. You must build a communist socie-
 ty. In many respects the first half of the
 work has been done. The old order has been
 destroyed, as it deserved to be, it has been
 transformed into a heap of ruins, as it de-
 served to be. The ground has been cleared
 and on this ground the young communist
 generation must build a communist society.
 You are faced with the task of construction,
 and you can cope with it only by mastering
 all modern knowledge, only if you are able
 to transform communism from ready-made,
 memorized formulas, counsels, recipes, pre-
 scriptions and programmes into that living
 thing which unites your immediate work,
 and only if you are able to transform com-
 munism into a guide for your practical
 work.
 This is the task by which you should be
 guided in educating, training and rousing
 the whole of the younger generation. You
 must be the foremost among the millions of
 builders of communist society, which every
 young man and young woman should be.
 Unless you enlist the whole mass of young
 18
 workers and peasants in the work of build-
 ing communism, you will not build a com-
 munist society.
 This naturally brings me to the ques-
 tion how we should teach communism and
 what the specific features of our methods
 should be.
 Here, first of all, I will deal with the
 question of communist ethics.
 You must train yourselves to be Com-
 munists. The task of the Youth League is to
 organize its practical activities in such a
 way that, by learning, organizing, uniting
 and fighting, its members should train them-
 selves and all who look to it as a leader; they
 should train Communists. The whole object
 of training, educating and teaching the
 youth of today should be to imbue them
 with communist ethics.
 But is there such a thing as communist
 ethics? Is there such a thing as communist
 morality? Of course, there is. It is often made
 to appear that we have no ethics of our own;
 and  very  often  the  bourgeoisie accuse
 us Communists of repudiating all ethics.
 This is a method of shuffling concepts, of
 19
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108/11: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 throwing dust in the eyes of the workers
 dnd peasants.
 In what sense do we repudiate ethics and
 morality?
 In the sense in which it is preached by
 the bourgeoisie, who derived ethics from
 God's commandments. We, of course, say
 that we do not believe in God, and that we
 know perfectly well that the clergy, the land-
 lords and the bourgeoisie spoke in the
 name of God in pursuit of their own in-
 terests as exploiters. Or instead of deriving
 ethics from the commandments of morality,
 from the commandments of God, they de-
 rived                      it  from  idealist  or  semi-idealist
 phrases, which always amounted to some-
 thing very similar to God's commandments.
 \\'e repudiate all morality taken apart
 from human society and classes. We say
 that it is a deception, a fraud, a befogging
 of the minds of the workers and peasants
 in  the  interests  of  the  landlords  and
 capitalists.
 `Ve s                          171-ity - is --1'--~- en~itely sub-
 ordinated that our moral                                    i~          b-
 ordinated to the interests of the class strug-
 gle of the proletariat. Our morality is de
 20
 rived from the interests of the class struggle
 of the proletariat.
 The old society was based on the oppres-
 sion of all the workers and peasants by the
 landlords and capitalists. We had to destroy
 this, we had to overthrow them; but for this
 we had to create unity. God would not cre-
 ate such unity.
 This unity could be provided only by fac-
 tories and workshops, only by the proletar-
 iat, trained and roused from its long slum-
 ber. Only when that class was formed did
 the mass movement begin which led to what
 we see now-the victory of the proletarian
 revolution in one of the weakest of countries,
 which for three years has been repelling the
 onslaught of the bourgeoisie of the whole
 world. And we see how the proletarian revo-
 lution is growing all over the world. We
 now say, on the basis of experience, that
 only the proletariat could have created that
 compact force which the disunited and scat-
 tered peasantry are following and which has
 withstood all the onslaughts of the exploit-
 ers. Only this class can help the toiling
 masses to unite, rally their ranks and finally
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108/11: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 defend, finally consolidate and finally build
 up communist society.
 That is why we say that for us there is no
 such thing as morality apart from human
 society; it is a fraud. Morality for us is
 subordinated to the interests of the class
 struggle of the proletariat.
 What does this class struggle mean? It
 means overthrowing the tsar, overthrowing
 the capitalists,  abolishing the capitalist
 class.
 And what are classes in general? Classes
 are what permits one section of society to
 appropriate the labour of the other section.
 If one section of society appropriates all the
 land, we have a landlord class and a peas-
 ant class. If one section of society possesses
 the mills and factories, shares and capi-
 tal, while another section works in these
 factories, we have a capitalist class and a
 proletarian class.
 It was not difficult to drive out the tsar
 -that required only a few days. It was not
 very difficult to drive out the landlords-that
 was done in a few months. Nor was it very
 difficult to drive out the capitalists. But it is
 22
 incomparably  more  difficult  to  abolish
 classes; we still have the division into work-
 ers and peasants. If the peasant is settled
 on his separate plot of land and appropri-
 ates superfluous grain, that is, grain that he
 does not need for himself or for his cattle,
 while the rest of the people have to go with-
 out bread, then the peasant becomes an
 exploiter. The more grain he keeps for him-
 self, the more profitable he finds it; as for the
 rest, let them starve: "The more they starve
 the dearer I can sell this grain." Everybody
 must work according to a common plan, on
 common land, in common mills and factories
 and under common management. Is it easy
 to attain this? You see that it is not so easy
 as driving out the tsar, the landlords and the
 capitalists. What is required is that the
 proletariat re-educate, re-train a section of
 the peasantry; it must win over those who
 are toiling peasants in order to crush the
 resistance of those peasants who are rich and
 are profiting by the poverty and want of the
 rest. Hence the task of the proletarian strug-
 gle is not completed by the fact that we have
 overthrown the tsar and have driven out the

 landlords and capitalists, and to complete it
 is the task of the system we call the dicta-
 torship of the proletariat.
 The class struggle is still continuing; it
 has merely changed its forms. It is the class
 struggle of the proletariat to prevent the
 return of the old exploiters, to unite the
 scattered masses of unenlightened peasants
 into one union. The class struggle is contin-
 uing and it is our task to subordinate all
 interests to this struggle. And we subordi-
 nate our communist morality to this task.
 We say: morality is what serves to destroy
 the old exploiting society and to unite all
 the toilers around the proletariat, which is
 building up a new, communist society.
 Communist  morality  is the morality
 which serves this struggle, which unites the
 toilers against all exploitation, against all
 small property; for small property puts into
 the hands of one person what has been creat-
 ed. by the labour of the whole of society. In
 our country the land is common property.
 But suppose I take a piece of this com-
 mon property and grow on it twice as much
 grain as I need and profiteer in the surplus?
 Suppose I argue that the more starving
 people there are the more they will pay?
 Would I then be behaving like a Commu-
 nist? No, I would be behaving like an ex-
 ploiter, like a proprietor. This must be com-
 bated. If this is allowed to go on things will
 slide back to the rule of the capitalists, to
 the rule of the bourgeoisie, as has more than
 once happened in previous revolutions. And
 in order to prevent the restoration of the
 rule of the capitalists and the bourgeoisie
 we must not allow profiteering, we must not
 allow individuals to enrich themselves at the
 expense of the rest, and the toilers must
 unite with the proletariat and form a com-
 munist society. This is the principal feature
 of the fundamental task of the League
 and of the organization of the communist
 youth.
 The old society was based on the prin-
 ciple: rob or be robbed, work for others or
 make others work for you, be a slaveowner
 or a slave. Naturally, people brought up in
 such a society imbibe with their mother's
 milk, so to speak, the psychology, the habit,
 the concept: you are either a slaveowner or
 2.5

 a slave or else, a small owner, a small em-
 ployee, a small official, an intellectual-in
 short, a man who thinks only of himself, and
 doesn't give a hang for anybody else.
 If I work this plot of land, I don't give a
 hang for anybody else; if others starve, all
 the better, the more I will get for my grain.
 If I have a job as a doctor, engineer, teacher,
 or clerk, I don't give a hang for anybody
 else. Perhaps if I toady to and please the
 powers that be I shall keep my job, and even
 get on in life and become a bourgeois. A Com-
 munist cannot have such a psychology and
 such sentiments. When the workers and
 peasants proved that they are able by their
 own efforts to defend themselves and create a
 new society-that was the beginning of the
 new communist training, training in the
 struggle against the exploiters, training in
 alliance with the proletariat against the self-
 seekers  and  small  owners,  against  the
 psychology and habits which say: I seek my
 own profit and I don't give a hang for
 anything else.
 This is the reply to the question how the
 26
 young and rising generation should learn
 communism.
 It can learn communism only by linking
 up every step in its studies, training and
 education with the continuous struggle the
 proletarians and the toilers  are waging
 against the old exploiting society. When
 people talk to us about morality, we say: for
 the Communist, morality lies entirely in
 this solid, united discipline and conscious
 mass struggle against the exploiters. We
 do not believe in an eternal morality, and
 we expose. the deceit of all the fables about
 morality. Morality serves the purpose of
 helping human society to rise to a higher
 level and to get rid of the exploitation of
 labour.
 To achieve this we need the younger
 generation which began to awaken to con-
 scious life in the midst of the disciplined and
 desperate struggle against the bourgeoisie.
 In this struggle it is training genuine Com-
 munists, it must subordinate to this struggle
 and link with it every step in its studies,
 education and training. The training of the
 communist youth must consist not in giving
 27

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 them sentimental speeches and moral pre-
 cepts. This is not what training consists in.
 When people saw how their fathers and
 mothers lived under the yoke of the landlords
 and capitalists, when they themselves expe-
 rienced the sufferings that befell those who
 started the struggle against the exploiters,
 when they saw what sacrifices the continua-
 tion of this struggle entailed in order to
 defend what had been won, and when they
 saw what frenzied foes the landlords and
 capitalists are-they were trained in this
 environment to become Communists. The
 basis of communist morality is the struggle
 for the consolidation and completion of
 communism. That too is the basis of com-
 munist training, education, and teaching.
 That is the reply to the question how com-
 munism should be learnt.
 We would not believe in teaching, train-
 ing and education if they were confined
 only to the school and were divorced from
 the storm of life. As long as the workers and
 peasants continue to be oppressed by the
 landlords and capitalists, and as long as the
 schools remain in the hands of the landlords
 28
 and capitalists, the young generation will
 remain blind and ignorant. But our school
 must impart to the youth the fundamentals
 of knowledge, the ability to work out com-
 munist views independently; it must make
 educated people of them. In the time during
 which people attend school, it must train
 them to be participants in the struggle for
 emancipation from the exploiters. The Young
 Communist League will justify its name as
 the League of the young communist genera-
 tion only when it links up every step of its
 teaching,  training  and  education  with
 participation in the general struggle of all
 the toilers against the exploiters. For you
 know perfectly well that as long as Russia
 remains the only workers' republic, while
 the old bourgeois system exists in the rest
 of the world, we shall be weaker than they,
 we shall be under the constant menace of a
 new attack; and that only if we learn to be
 solid and united shall we win in the further
 struggle and-having gained strength-
 become really invincible. Thus, to be a
 Communist means that you must organize
 and unite the whole rising generation and

 srt ari example of training and discipline in
 this struggle. Then you will be able to
 start building the edifice of communist soci-
 ety and bring it '.o completion.
 In order to make this clearer to you I
 will quote an example. We call ourselves
 Communists. What is a Communist? Com-
 munist is a Latin word. Communis is the
 Latin for "common." Communist society is
 a society in which all things-the land, the
 factories-are owned in common and the
 people work in common.  That is  com-
 munism.
 Is it possible to work in common if each
 one works separately on his own plot of
 land? Work in common cannot be brought
 about all at once. That is impossible. It does
 not drop from the skies. It comes by toil and
 suffering, it is created in the course of strug-
 71e. Old books are of no use here; no one
 ill believe them. One's own living experi-
 nce is required. When Kolchak and Denikin
 dvancd from Siberia and the South the
 p :3 >antS were on their side. They did not
 111; fr,l~;hevism because the Bolsheviks took
 thir grain at a fixed price. But when the,
 30
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108/11: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 peasants in Siberia and the Ukraine experi-
 enced the rule of Kolchak and Denikin, they
 realized that they had only one alternative:
 either to go to the capitalist, and he would
 at once hand them over into slavery to the
 landlord; or to follow the worker, who, it is
 true, did not promise a land flowing with
 milk and honey, who demanded iron disci-
 pline and firmness in an arduous struggle,
 but who would lead them out of enslavement
 to the capitalists and landlords. When even
 the ignorant peasants realized and saw this
 from their own experience they became
 conscious adherents of communism, who
 had passed through a stern school. It is such
 experience that must form the basis of all
 the activities of the Young Communist
 League.
 I have replied to the questions what we
 must learn, what we must take from the old
 school and from the old science. I will now
 try to answer the question how this must be
 learnt. The answer is: only by inseparably
 linking every step in the activities of the
 school, every step in training, education and
 31
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 set an example of training and discipline in
 this struggle. Then you will be able to

 teaching, with the struggle of all the toilers
 against the exploiters.
 I will quote a few examples from the
 experience of the work of some of the youth
 organizations to illustrate how this training
 in communism should proceed. Everybody
 is talking about abolishing illiteracy. You
 know that a communist society cannot be
 built in an illiterate country. It is not enough
 for the Soviet  government to issue an
 order, or for the Party to issue a particular
 slogan, or to assign a certain number of the
 best workers to this task. The younger
 generation itself must take up this work.
 Communism means that the youth, the
 young men and women who belong to the
 Youth League, would say. this is our job;
 we shall unite and go into the rural districts
 to abolish illiteracy, so that there shall
 be no illiterates among our rising genera-
 tion.  \Ve  are  trying  to  get  the  rising
 generation to devote its activities to this
 work. You know that we cannot quickly
 transform ignorant, illiterate Russia into a
 literate country. But if the Youth League
 sets to work on this job, if all the young
 32
 people work  for the benefit  of all, the
 League, which unites 400,000 young men
 and women, will be entitled to call itself a
 Young Communist League. Another task of
 the League is, after having acquired any
 particular knowledge, to help those young
 people who cannot liberate themselves from
 the darkness of  illiteracy by  their own
 efforts. Being a member of the Youth League
 means devoting one's labour and efforts to
 the common cause. That is what communist
 training means. Only in the course of such
 work does a young man or woman become
 a real Communist. Only if they achieve
 practical results in this work will they be-
 come Communists.
 Take, for example, work on the suburban
 vegetable gardens. Isn't this a task? This is
 one of the tasks of the Young Communist
 League. The people are starving; there is
 starvation in the mills and factories. In order
 to save ourselves from starvation, vegetable
 gardens must be developed. But agriculture
 is being carried on in the old way. There-
 fore, more class-conscious elements must
 undertake this work, and you would then
 33

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 0
 find that the number of vegetable gardens
 would increase, their area grow, and the
 results improve.  The Young Communist
 League must take an active part in this
 work. Every League and every branch of the
 League should regard this as its job.
 The Young Communist League must be
 a shock group, helping in every job and
 displaying initiative and enterprise. The
 League should be such that any worker may
 see that it consists of people whose teach-
 ings he may not understand, whose teach-
 ings  he  perhaps  may  not  immediately
 believe, but from whose practical work and
 activity he could see that they are really the
 people who are showing him the right road.
 If the Young Communist League fails to
 organize its work in this way in all fields,
 it will mean that it is slipping into the old,
 bourgeois  path.  We must combine  our
 training with the struggle of the toilers
 against the exploiters in order to help the for-
 mer to perform the tasks that follow from
 the teachings of communism.
 The members of the League should use
 every spare hour to improve the vegetable
 .34
 gardens, or to organize the education of
 young people in some mill or factory, and so
 forth. We want to transform Russia from a
 poverty-stricken and wretched country into
 a wealthy country. And the Young Com-
 munist League must combine its education,
 teaching and training with the labour of the
 workers and peasants, so as not to shut
 itself up in its schools and not to confine
 itself to reading communist  books  and
 pamphlets. Only by working side by side
 with the workers and peasants can one
 become a genuine Communist. And every-
 one must be made to see that all those who
 belong to the Youth League are literate and
 at the same time know how to work. When
 everyone sees that we have driven the old
 drill methods from the old school and have
 replaced them by conscious discipline, that
 all young men and women are taking part in
 subbotniks, that they are utilizing every
 suburban farm to help the population-the
 people will cease to look upon labour as they
 looked upon it before.
 It is the task of the Young Communist
 League to organize assistance in the village
 35

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 or in the city block in such a matter as-I
 take a small example-cleanliness or the
 distribution of food. How was this done in
 the old capitalist society? Everybody worked
 for himself alone, and nobody cared whether
 there were aged or sick, or whether all the
 housework fell on the shoulders of the wom-
 en, who, as a result, were in a state of
 oppression and slavery. Whose business is
 it to combat this? It is the business of the
 Youth Leagues, which must say: we shall
 change all this; we shall organize detach-
 ments of young people who will help to
 maintain cleanliness or to distribute food,
 who will make systematic house-to-house
 inspections, who will work in an organized
 way for the benefit of the whole of society,
 properly  distributing  their  forces  and
 demonstrating that labour must be organ-
 ized labour.
 The generation which is now about fifty
 years old cannot expect to see the commu-
 nist society. This generation will die out
 before then. But the generation which is
 now fifteen years old will see the communist
 society, and will itself build this society. And
 36
 it must know that the whole purpose of its
 life is to build this society. In the old society
 work was carried on by separate families,
 and nobody united their labour except the
 landlords and capitalists, who oppressed the
 masses of the people. We must organize all
 labour, no matter how dirty and arduous it
 may be, in such a way that every worker and
 peasant may say: I am part of the great ar-
 my of free labour, and I can build my life
 without the landlords and capitalists, I can
 establish the communist system. The Young
 Communist League must train everybody to
 conscious and disciplined labour from an
 early age. In this way we shall be sure that
 the problems that are now confronting us
 will be solved. We must assume that no
 less than ten years will be required for the
 electrification of the country, so that our
 impoverished land may be served by the
 latest achievements of technology. And so,
 the generation which is now fifteen years
 old, and which in ten or twenty years' time
 will be living in communist society, must
 approach all its tasks in education in such
 a way that every day, in every village and
 37

 every town, the young people shall engage
 in the practical solution of some problem.
 of common labour, even though the smallest,
 even though the simplest. To the extent that
 this is done in every village, to the extent
 that communist emulation develops, to the
 extent that the youth prove that they can
 unite their labour, to that extent will the
 success of communist construction be en-
 sured. Only by regarding our every step from
 the standpoint of the success of this con-
 struction, only by asking ourselves wheth-
 er we have done all we can to be united,
 conscious toilers, will the Young Communist
 League succeed in uniting its half a million
 members into a single army of labour and
 win universal respect. (Stormy applause.)

 PREFACE TO THE GERMAN
 EDITION OF 1872
 The Communist League, an international as-
 sociation of workers, which could of course be
 only a secret one under the conditions obtaining
 at the time, commissioned the undersigned, at the
 Congress held in London in November 1847, to
 draw up for publication a detailed theoretical and
 practical programme of the Party. Such was the
 origin of the following Manifesto, the manuscript
 of which travelled to London, to be printed, a
 few weeks before the February Revolution.' First
 published in German, it has been republished in
 that language in at least twelve different editions
 in Germany, England and America. It was pub-
 lished in English for the first time in 1850 in the
 Red Republican, London, translated by Miss Hel-
 en Macfarlane, and in 1871 in at least three dif-
 ferent translations in America. A French version

 Geneva in the sixties. Into Danish,  too, it was

 February Revolution, and then, still more, in the
 Paris Commune, where the proletariat for the
 first time held political power for tvvro  whole
 months, this programme has in some details be-
 come antiquated. One thing especially was proved
 by the Commune, viz., that "the working class
 cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state
 machinery, and wield it for its own purposes. "
 (See The Civil War in Trance; Address of the Gen-
 eral Council of the International Working Il'Ien's

 this point is further developed.)' Further, it is
 self-evident that the criticism of socialist litera-
 ture is deficient, in relation to the present time,
 because it comes down only to 1847; also, that the
 remarks on the relation of the Communists to the
 various opposition parties (Section IV),  although
 in principle still correct, yet in practice are anti-
 quated, because the political situation has been
 entirely changed, and the progress of history has
 swept from off the earth the greater portion of
 the political parties there enumerated.

 PREFACE TO THE RUSSIAN
 EDITION OF 1882
 rl'he first Russian edition of the Manifesto of
 the Communist Party, translated by Bakunin, was
 published early in the sixties' by the  printing
 office of the Kolokol. Then the West could see in
 it (the Russian edition of the Manifesto) only a
 literary curiosity. Such a view would be impos-
 sible today.
 What a limited field the proletarian move-
 ment still occupied at that time (December 1847)
 is most clearly shown by the last section of the
 Manifesto: the position of the Communists in
 relation to the various opposition parties in the
 various countries. Precisely Russia and the Unit-
 ed States are missing here. It was the time when
 Russia constituted the last great reserve of all
 European reaction,when the United States absorbed

 flow very different today! Precisely European
 immigration fitted North America for a gigantic
 agricultural production,  whose  competition is
 shaking the very foundations of European landed
 property-large and small. In addition it ena-
 bled the United States to exploit its tremendous
 industrial resources with an energy  and  on a
 scale that must shortly break    the industrial
 monopoly of Western Europe,      and especially
 of England, existing up to now. Loth circum-
 stances react in revolutionary manner upon Amer-
 ica itself. Step by step the small and middle land
 ownership of the farmers, the basis of the whole
 political  constitution,  is  succumbing  to  the
 competition of giant; farms; simultaneously, a
 mass proletariat and a fabulous  concentration
 of capitals are developing for the first time in
 the industrial regions.

 PREFACE
 And now Russia! During the Revolution of
 1848-49 not only the European princes, but the
 European bourgeois as well,  found their only
 salvation from the proletariat, just beginning to
 awaken, in Russian intervention. The tsar was
 proclaimed the chief of European reaction. Today
 he is a prisoner of war of the revolution, in
 Gatchina, and Russia forms the vanguard of rev-
 olutionary action in Europe.
 The Communist Manifesto had as its object
 the proclamation of the inevitably impending
 dissolution of modern bourgeois property. But in
 Russia we find, face to face with the rapidly de-
 veloping capitalist swindle and bourgeois landed
 property, just beginning to develop, more than
 half the land owned in common by the peasants.
 Now the question is: can the Russian obslichina,1
 though greatly undermined, yet a form of the pri-
 meval common ownership of land, pass directly
 to the higher form of communist common owner-
 ship? Or on the contrary,  must  it first pass
 through the same process of dissolution as con-
 stitutes the historical evolution  of the West?

 The only answer to that possible today is this:
 If the Russian Revolution becomes the signal for
 a proletarian revolution in the West,, so that
 both complement each other, the present Russian
 common ownership of land may serve as the start-
 ing point for a communist development.

 PREFACE TO THE GERMAN
 EDITION OF 1833
 The preface to the present edition I must,
 alas, sign alone. Mart, the man to whom the
 whole working class of Europe and America owes
 more than to anyone else-rests at Highgate
 Cemetery and over his grave the first grass is
 already growing. Since his death, there can be
 even less thought of revising or supplementing
 the Manifesto. All the more do I consider it
 necessary  again  to  state  hero  the  following
 expressly:
 The basic thought running through the Mani-
 festo-that economic production and the struc-
 1;ure o?' society of every historical epoch necessa-
 rily arising therefrom constitute the foundation
 for the political and intellectual history of that
 epoch; that consequently (ever since the disso-
 lution of the primeval communal ownership of
 land) all history has been a history of class striig-
 gles, of struggles between exploited and exploiting,

 various stages of social development;  that this
 struggle, however, has now reached a stage where
 the exploited and oppressed  class  (the prole-
 tariat) can no longer emancipate itself from the
 class which exploits and oppresses it (the bour-
 geoisie), without at the same time forever freeing
 the whole of society from exploitation, oppression
 and class struggles-this basic thought belongs
 solely and exclusively to Marx.'

 PREFACE TO THE ENGLISH
 EDITION OF 1888
 The "Manifesto" was published as the plat-
 form of the "Communist  League," a  working-
 men's association, first exclusively German, lat-
 er on international, and, under the political con-
 ditions of the Continent before 1848, unavoida-
 bly a secret society. At a Congress of the League,
 held in London in November, 1847, Marx and
 Engels were commissioned to prepare for publi-
 cation a complete theoretical and practical party-
 programme. Drawn up in German, in January,
 1848, the manuscript was sent to the printer in
 London a few weeks before the French revolution
 of  February 24th. A  French translation was
 brought out in Paris, shortly before the insurrec-
 tion of June, 1848. The first English translation,
 by Miss llelen Macfarlane, appeared in George
 Julian Barney's  "Red Republican," London,

 1850. A Danish and a Polish edition had also
 been published.
 The defeat of the Parisian insurrection of
 June, '1848,-the first great battle between Pro-
 letariat and. Bourgeoisie-drove again into  the
 background, for a time, the social and political
 aspirations of the European working class. Thence-
 forth, the struggle for supremacy was again, as
 it had been before the revolution of February,
 solely between different sections of the proper-
 tied class; the working class was reduced to a
 fight for political elbow-room, and  to the posi-
 tion of extreme wing of the middle-class Radicals.
 Wherever independent  proletarian  movements
 continued to show signs of life, they were ruth-
 lessly hunted down. Thus the Prussian police
 hunted out the Central Board of the Communist
 League, then located in Cologne. The members
 were arrested, and, after eighteen months' impris-
 onment, they were tried in October, 1852. This
 celebrated  "Cologne  Communist  trial" lasted
 from October 4th till November 12th; seven of
 the prisoners were sentenced to terms of impris-
 onment in a fortress, varying from three to sit
 years.   Immediately  after  the sentence;   the

 League was formally dissolved by the remaining
 members. As to the "Manifesto, "it seemed thence-
 forth to be doomed to oblivion.
 When the European working class had recov-
 ered sufficient strength for another attack on the
 ruling classes, the International Working Men's
 Association sprang up.  But  this  association,
 formed with the express aim of welding into one
 body the whole militant proletariat of Europe and
 America, could not at once proclaim the prin-
 ciples laid down in the "Manifesto. " The Inter-
 national was bound to have a programme broad
 enough to be acceptable to the English Trades'
 Unions, to the follo\vers of Proudhon in France,
 Belgium, Italy, and Spain, and to the Lassal-
 leansa in Germany. Marx, who drew up this pro-
 gramme to the satisfaction of all parties, entire-
 ly trusted to the intellectual development of the
 working class, which was sure to  result from
 combined action and mutual discussion. The very
 a Lassalle  personally, to us, always acknowledged
 himself to be a disciple of Marx, and, as such, stood
 on the ground of the "Manifesto." But in his public
 agitation, 1862-64, he did not go beyond demanding
 co-operative workshops supported by State credit. [Note

 events and vicissitudes of the struggle  against
 Capital, the defeats even more than the victories,
 could not help bringing home to men's minds the
 insufficiency of their various favourite nostrums,
 and preparing the way for a more complete in-
 sight into the true conditions of working-class
 emancipation. And Marx was right. The Interna-
 tional, on its breaking up in 1874, left the work-
 ers quite different mere from  what it had found
 them in 1864. Proudhonism in France, Lassallean-
 ism in Germany were dying out, and even the
 Conservative  English Trades'  Unions,  though
 most of them had long since severed their con-
 nexion with the International, were gradually
 advancing towards that point at  which, last
 year at Swansea, their President could say in
 their name "Continental Socialism has lost its
 terrors for us." In fact: the  principles of the
 "Manifesto" had  made considerable  headway
 among the working men of all countries.
 The  "Manifesto" itself thus  came to the
 front again. The German text had  been, since
 1850, reprinted several times  in Switzerland,
 England and America. In 1872, it was translated
 i ni n English in New York, whore the translation
 22
 was published in "Woodhull and Claflin's Week-
 ly." From this English version, a French one
 was made in "Le Socialiste" of New York. Since
 then at least two more English translations,
 more or less mutilated, have been brought out in
 America, and one of them has been reprinted in
 England. The first Russian translation, made
 by Bakounine, was published at Herzen's "Ko-
 lokol" office in Geneva, about 1863; a second one,
 by the heroic Vera Zasulich,l also in Geneva,
 1882. A new Danish edition is to be found in
 "Social-demokratisk  Bibliothek, "  Copenhagen,
 1885; a fresh French translation in "Le Social-

 version was prepared and published in Madrid,
 1886. 'l,he German reprints are not to be counted,

 afraid of bringing out a book with the name of
 Mari on it, while the translator declined to call
 it his own production. Of further translations
 into other languages I have heard, but have not
 seen them. Thus the history of the "Manifesto"
 reflects, to a great extent, the history of the mod-
 ern working-class  movement;  at present it is
 undoubtedly the most wide-spread, the most in-
 ternational production of all Socialist  litera-
 ture, the  common platform acknowledged by
 millions of working men from Siberia to Cali-
 fornia.
 Yet, when it was written, we could not have
 called it a Socialist Manifesto. By Socialists, in
 1847, were understood, on the one hand, the ad-
 herents of the various Utopian systems: Owen-
 ites in Eng?and, Fourierists in France,  both of
 them already reduced to the position of mere
 sects, and gradually dying out; on the other
 band, the most multifarious social quacks, who,
 by all manners of tinkering, professed to redress,
 without any danger to capital and  profit, all
 sorts of social grievances, in both cases men
 outside the working-class movement, and look-
 ing rather to the "educated" classes for support.
 24
 PREFACE
 Whatever portion of the working class had become
 convinced  of the insufficiency of mere politi-
 cal revolutions, and had proclaimed the necessity
 of a total social change, that portion then called
 itself Communist. It was a crude, rough-hewn,
 purely instinctive sort of Communism; still, it
 touched the  cardinal point and was powerful
 enough amongst the working class to produce the
 Utopian Communism, in France, of Cabet, and
 in Germany, of \Veitling. Thus, Socialism was,
 in 1847, a middle-class movement, Communism
 a working-class movement. Socialism was, on the
 Continent at least, "respectable "; Communism
 was the very opposite. And as our notion, from
 the very beginning, was that "the emancipation
 of the working class must be the act of the work-
 ing class itself, " there could be no doubt as to
 which of the two names we must take. Moreover,
 we have, ever since, been far from repudiat-
 ing it.
 The "Manifesto" being our joint production,
 I consider myself bound to state that the funda-
 mental proposition, which forms its nucleus, be-
 longs to Marx. That proposition is: that in every
 historical epoch, the prevailing mode of econom-

 is production and exchange, and the social or-
 ganisation necessarily following from it, form
 the basis upon which is built up, and from which
 alone can be explained, the political and intel-
 lectual history of that epoch; that consequently
 the whole history of mankind (since the dissolu-
 tion of primitive tribal society, holding land in
 common ownership) has been a history of class
 struggles, contests between exploiting and  ex-
 ploited, ruling and oppressed classes; that the
 history of these class struggles forms a series of
 evolutions in which,  now-a-days, a stage has
 been reached where the exploited and oppressed
 class-the proletariat-cannot attain its emanci-
 pation from the sway of the exploiting and ruling
 class-the  bourgeoisie-without,  at  the same
 time, and once and for all, emancipating society
 at large from all exploitation, oppression, class
 distinctions and class struggles.
 This proposition which, in my opinion, is des-
 tined to do for history what Darwin's theory has
 done for biology, we, both of us, had been grad-
 ually approaching for some years before 1845.
 How far I had independently progressed towards
 it, is hest shown by my "Condition of the Work-
 26
 ing Class in England. "1 But when I again met
 Marx at Brussels, in spring, 1845, he had it ready
 worked out, and put it before  me,  in terms
 almost as clear as those in which I have stated
 it here.
 From our joint preface to the German edition
 of 1872, I quote the following:-
 "IIowever much the state of things may have
 altered during the last twenty-five  years, the
 general principles laid down in this Manifesto

 pend, as the Manifesto itself states, everywhere
 and at all times, on the historical conditions

 no special stress is laid on the revolutionary
 measures proposed at the end of Section II.

 PREFACE TO THE GERMAN

 Since the above was written, a new German
 edition of the Manifesto has again become neces-
 sary, and much has also happened to the Mani-

 A second Russian translation-by Vera Za-
 sulich-appeared at Geneva in 1882; the preface
 to that edition was written by Marx and myself.
 Unfortunately, the original German manuscript
 has gone astray; I must therefore retranslate
 from the Russian, which will in no way improve
 the text.2 It reads:
 "The first Russian edition of the Manifesto
 of the Communist Party, translated by Bakunin,

 edition of 1883.-Ed.

 property-large and small. Iii addition it enabled
 the United States to exploit its tremendous indus-
 trial resources with an energy and on a scale
 that must shortly break the industrial monopoly
 of Western Europe, and especially of England,
 existing up to now. Both circumstances react irr
 revolutionary manner upon America itself. Step
 by step the small and middle land ownership of
 the farmers, the basis of the whole political con-
 stitution, is succumbing to the competition of
 giant farms; simultaneously, a mass proletariat
 and a fabulous concentration of  capitals are
 developing for the first time in the industrial re-
 gions.
 And now Russia! During the Revolution of
 1848-49 not only the European princes, but the
 European bourgeois as well, found their only sal-
 vation from the proletariat, just beginning to
 awaken, in Russian intervention. rihe tsar was
 proclaimed the chief of European reaction. rhoday

 Russia we find, face to face with the rapidly de-
 veloping capitalist swindle and bourgeois landed
 property, just beginning to develop, more than
 half the land owned in common by the peasants.
 Now the question is: can the Russian obshchina,
 though greatly undermined, yet a form  of the
 primeval common ownership of land, pass direct-
 ly to the higher form of communist common own-
 ership? Or on the contrary, must it first pass
 through  the  same  process  of        dissolution  as
 constitutes the historical evolution of the West?

 this: If the Russian Revolution becomes the sig-

 serve as the starting point for a communist

 PREFACE
 Furthermore, a new Danish  translation has
 appeared  in  the Socialdemokratisk  Bibliotlaelc,
 Kjobenhavn 1885. Unfortunately it is not quite
 complete; certain essential passages, which seem
 to have presented difficulties  to  the transla-
 tor, have been omitted, and in addition there
 are signs of carelessness here and there, which
 are all the more unpleasantly conspicuous since
 the translation indicates that had the translator
 taken a little more pains he would have done an
 excellent piece of work.
 A new French version appeared in 1855 in Le
 Socialiste of Paris; it is the best published to
 date.
 From this latter a Spanish version was pub-
 lished the same year, first in El Socialista of
 Madrid, and then re-issued in pamphlet form:
 Marti f iesto  del  Partido  Comanista  por  Carlos
 Marx y F. Engels, Madrid, Administration de
 El Socialista, hlernan Cortes 8.
 As a matter of curiosity I may also mention
 that in 1887 the manuscript of an Armenian trans-
 lation was offered  to a publisher in Constan-
 tinople. But the good man did not have the
 courage to publish something bearing the name of
 34
 PREFACE
 Marx and suggested that the translator set down
 his own name as author, which the latter, how-
 ever, declined.
 After one and then another of the more or less
 inaccurate American translations had  been re-
 peatedly reprinted in England, an authentic ver-
 sion at last appeared in '1888. rfllis was by my
 friend Samuel Moore, and we went through it
 together once more before it was sent to press.
 It is entitled: Manifesto of the Communist Party,
 by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels. Authorised
 English Translation,  edited and annotated by
 Frederick   Engels.  1888.   London,   William
 Reeves, 185 Fleet st., E. C. I have added some of
 the notes of that edition to the present one.
 The Manifesto has had a history of its own.
 Greeted with enthusiasm, at the time of its ap-
 pearance, by the then still not at all numerous
 vanguard of scientific Socialism (as is proved by
 the translations mentioned in the first preface),
 it was soon forced into the background by the
 reaction that began with the defeat of the Paris
 workers in June 1848, and was finally excom-
 municated "according to law" by the conviction
 of the Cologne Communists in November 1852.

 PREFACE
 With the disappearance from the public scene of
 the workers' movement that had begun with the
 February Revolution, the Manifesto too passed
 into the background.
 When the working class of Europe had again
 gathered sufficient strength for a new onslaught
 upon the power of the ruling classes, the Inter-
 national Working Men's Association came into
 being. Its aim was to weld together into one
 huge army the whole  militant working class of
 Europe and America. Therefore it could riot set
 out from the principles laid down in the Manifes-
 to. It was bound to have a programme which
 would not shut the door on the English trade
 unions, the French, Belgian, Italian and Spanish
 Proudhonists and the German Lassalleans.' This
 programme-the preamble  to  the Rules of the
 International-was drawn up by Marx with a
 master hand acknowledged even by Bakunin and
 1 Lassalle personally, to us, always acknowledged
 himself to be a "disciple" of Marx, arid, as such, stood,
 of course, on the ground of the Manifesto. Matters were
 quite different with regard  to  those of his followers
 who did riot go beyond his demand for producers' co-oper-
 atives supported by state credits and who divided the
 whole working class into supporters of state assistance
 and supporters of self-assistance. [Note by Engels.]

 the Anarchists.  For the ultimate triumph of
 the ideas set forth in the Manifesto Marx relied
 solely and exclusively upon the intellectual de-
 velopment of the working class, as it. necessarily
 had to ensue from united action and discussion.
 The  events  and  vicissitudes  in  the struggle
 against capital, the defeats even more than the
 successes, could not, but demonstrate to the fighters
 the inadequacy hitherto of their universal pana-
 ceas and make their minds more receptive to
 a thorough understanding of the true conditions
 for the emancipation of the workers. And Marx
 was  right.  rile working class of 1874, at the dis-
 solution of the International, was  altogether
 different from that of 1864, at its foundation.
 Proudhonism in the Latin countries and the spe-
 cific Lassalleanism in Germany were dying out,
 and even      the  then archconservative English
 trade unions were   gradually approaching the
 point  where in 1887 the  chairman  of  their
 Swansea . Congress  could say  in their  name
 "Continental Socialism has lost its  terrors for
 us." Yet by 1887 Continental Socialism was
 almost exclusively the theory heralded in the
 Manifesto. Thus, to a certain extent, the history

 of the Manifesto reflects the history of the mod-
 ern working-class                                          movement  since  1848.  At
 present it is doubtless the most widely circulated,
 the most international product of all Socialist
 literature,  the  common                 programme  of   many
 millions of workers of all countries, from Si-
 beria to California.
 Nevertheless,  when it appeared                 we  could
 not have called it a Socialist Manifesto. In 1847
 two kinds of people were considered Socialists.
 On the one hand were the adherents of the various
 Utopian systems, notably the Owenites in Eng-
 land and the Fourierists in France, both of whom
 at that date had already dwindled to mere sects
 gradually dying out. On the other, the manifold
 types of social quacks who wanted to eliminate
 social abuses through their various universal pan-
 aceas and all kinds of patchwork, without hurt-
 ing capital and profit in the least. In both cases,
 people who stood outside the labour movement
 and who looked for support rather to the "edu-
 cated" classes. The section of the working class,
 however, which demanded a radical reconstruction
 of society, convinced that mere political revolu-
 tions were not enough, then called itself Commu-
 38
 I'REFACE
 itist. It was still a rough-hewn, only instinctive,
 and  frequently somewhat crude Communism.
 Yet it was powerful enough to bring into being
 two systems of Utopian Communism-in France
 the  "Icarian" Communism  of Cabet,  and in
 Germany that of Weitling. Socialism in 1847
 signified a bourgeois movement, Communism
 a working-class movement. Socialism was, on the
 Continent at least, quite respectable, whereas
 Communism was the very opposite. And since
 we were very decidedly of the opinion as early
 as then that "the emancipation of the workers
 must be the act of the working class itself,"
 we could have no hesitation as to which of the
 two names we should choose. Nor has it ever
 occurred to us since to repudiate it.
 "Working men of all countries, unite!" But
 few voices responded when we proclaimed these
 words to the world forty-two years ago, on the
 eve of the first Paris Revolution in which the
 proletariat came out with demands of its own.
 On September 28, 1864, however, the proletarians
 of most of the Western European countries joined
 hands in the International Working Men's Associa-
 tion of glorious memory. True, the International

 itself lived only nine years. But that the eternal
 union of the proletarians of all countries created
 by it is stall alive and lives stronger than ever,
 there is no better witness than this day. Because
 today, as I write these lines, the European and
 American proletariat  is revie\villg its fighting
 forces, mobilised for the first time, mobilised as one
 army, under one flag, for one immediate aim: the
 standard eight-hour working day, to be established
 by legal enactment, as proclaimed by the Geneva
 Congress of the International in 1866, and again
 by the Paris Workers' Congress in 1889. And to-
 day's spectacle will open the eyes of the capital-
 ists and landlords of all countries to the fact
 that today the working men of all countries are
 united indeed.

 with his own eyes!

 PREFACE TO THE POLISH
 EDITION OF 18921
 The fact that a new Polish edition of the
 Communist Manifesto has become necessary gives
 rise to various thoughts.
 First of all, it is noteworthy that of late the
 Manifesto has become an index, as it were, of the
 development of large-scale industry on the Euro-
 pean continent. In proportion as large-scale in-
 dustry expands in a given country, the demand S
 grows among the workers of that country for
 enlightenment regarding  their position as the
 working class in relation to the possessing classes,
 the socialist  movement spreads  among them
 and the demand for the  Manifesto increases.
 Thus, not only the state of the labour movement
 but also the degree of development of large-scale
 industry can be measured with fair accuracy in

 PREFACE
 every country by the number of copies of the
 Manifesto  circulated in the language of that
 country.
 Accordingly, the new Polish edition indi-
 cates a decided progress of Polish industry. And
 there can be no doubt whatever that this progress
 since the previous edition published ten years
 ago has actually taken place. Russian Poland,
 Congress Poland, has become the big industrial
 region of the Russian Empire. Whereas Russian
 large-scale industry is scattered sporadically-a
 part round the Gulf of Finland, another in the
 centre  (Moscow and Vladimir), a  third along
 the coasts of the Black and Azov seas, and still
 others  elsewhere-Polish  industry  has  been
 packed into a relatively small area and enjoys
 both the advantages and the disadvantages aris-
 ing from such concentration. The competing Rus-
 sian manufacturers acknowledged the advantages
 when they demanded protective tariffs against
 Poland, in spite of their ardent desire to trans-
 form the Poles into Russians. The disadvantages
 -for the Polish manufacturers and the Russian
 government-are manifest in the rapid spread
 of  socialist  ideas among the  Polish workers
 42
 43
 PREFACE
 and  in  the  growing  demand  for  the  Mani-
 festo.
 But the rapid development of Polish industry,
 outstripping that of Russia, is in its turn a new
 proof of the inexhaustible vitality of the Polish
 people and a new guarantee of its impending na-
 tional restoration. And the restoration of an
 independent strong Poland is a matter which
 concerns not only the Poles but all of us. A sin-
 cere international collaboration of the European
 nations is possible only if each of these nations
 is fully autonomous in its own house. The Revo-
 lution of 1848, which under the banner of the
 proletariat, after all, merely let the proletarian
 fighters do the  work of the bourgeoisie, also
 secured the independence of Italy, Germany and
 IIungary  through its  testamentary executors,
 Louis Bonaparte and Bismarck; but Poland,
 which since 1792 had done more for the Revolu-
 tion than all these three together, was left to
 its own resources  when it succumbed in 1863
 to a tenfold greater Russian force. The nobility
 could neither maintain nor regain Polish in-
 dependence; today, to the bourgeoisie,  this in-
 dependence is, to say the least,  immaterial..

 Nevertheless, it is a necessity for the harmonious
 collaboration of the European nations. It can
 be gained only by the young Polish proletariat,
 and in its hands it is secure. For the workers
 of all the rest of Europe need the independence
 of Poland just as much as the Polish workers
 themselves.

 PREFACE TO THE ITALIAN
 EDITION OF 1893
 TO THE ITALIAN READER
 Publication of the Manifesto of the Commu-
 nist Party coincided, one may say, with March
 18, 1848, the day of the revolutions in Milan
 and Berlin, which were armed uprisings of the
 two nations situated in the centre, the one, of the
 corrtrrrent of Europe, the other, of the Mediterra-
 nean; two nations until then enfeebled by divi-
 sion and internal strife, and thus fallen under
 foreign  domination.  While  Italy was subject
 to the Emperor of Austria, Germany underwent

 of the Tsar of all the Russias. The consequences
 of March 18, 1848, freed both Italy and Germany
 from this disgrace; if from 1848 to 1871 these
 two great nations were reconstituted and some-
 how again put on their own, it was, as Karl
 Marx used to say, because the men who suppressed

 the  Revolution of 1848 were, nevertheless, its
 testamentary executors in spite of themselves.
 Everywhere that revolution was the work of
 the working class; it was the latter that built the
 barricades and paid with its lifeblood. Only the
 Paris workers, in overthrowing the government,
 had the very definite intention of overthrowing
 the bourgeois  regime.  But conscious though
 they were of the fatal antagonism existing be-
 tween their own class and the bourgeoisie, still,
 neither the economic progress of the country nor
 the intellectual  development  of  the mass of
 French workers had as yet reached the stage
 which would have made a social reconstruction
 possible. In the final analysis, therefore, the fruits
 of the revolution were reaped by the capitalist
 class. In the other countries, in Italy, in Germany,
 in Austria, the workers, from the very outset, did
 nothing but raise the bourgeoisie to power. But
 in any country the rule of the bourgeoisie is
 impossible without national independence. There-
 fore, the Revolution of 1848 had to bring in its
 train the unity and autonomy of the nations
 that had lacked them up to then: Italy, Germany,
 Hungary. Poland will follow in turn.
 46
 PR EPA CE
 Thus, if the Revolution of 1848 was not a so-
 cialist revolution, it paved the way,  prepared
 the ground for the latter. Through the impetus
 given to large-scale industry in all countries, the
 bourgeois regime during the last forty-five years
 has everywhere created a numerous, concentrated
 and powerful proletariat. It has thus raised, to
 use the language of the Manilesto, its own grave-
 diggers. Without restoring autonomy and unity
 to each nation, it will be impossible to achieve
 the international union of the proletariat, or the
 peaceful and intelligent co-operation of these na-
 tions toward common aims. Just imagine joint
 international action by the Italian, Hungarian,
 German, Polish and Russian workers under the
 political conditions preceding 1848!
 The battles fought in 1848 were thus not
 fought in vain. Nor have the forty-five years sep-
 arating us from that revolutionary epoch passed
 to no purpose. The fruits arc ripening, and all
 I wish is that the publication of this Italian
 translation may augur as well for the victory
 of  the  Italian proletariat as the  publication
 of the original did for the international revo-
 lution,

 PREFACE
 The Manifesto does full justice to the revolu-
 tionary part played by capitalism  in the past.
 The first capitalist nation was Italy. The close
 of the feudal Middle Ages, and the opening of
 the modern capitalist era are marked by a colos-
 sal figure: an Italian, Dante, both the last poet
 of the Middle Ages and the first poet of modern
 times. Today, as in 1300, a new historical era
 is approaching. Will Italy give us the new Dante,
 who will mark the hour of birth of this new, pro-
 letarian era?

 A spectre is haunting Europe-the  spectre
 of Communism. All the Powers of old Europe
 have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this
 spectre: Pope and Czar, Metternich and Guizot,
 French Radicals and German polio-spies.
 Where is the party in opposition that has not
 been decried as Communistic by its opponents
 in power? Where the Opposition that has not
 hurled back the branding reproach of Communism,
 against the more advanced opposition parties, as
 well as against its reactionary adversaries?
 Two things result from this fact.
 I. Communism is already acknowledged by
 all European Powers to be itself a Power.
 II. It is high time that Communists should

 openly,  in  the  face  of  the  whole  world,
 publish their views, their aims, their tendencies,
 and meet this nursery tale of the Spectre of
 Communism with a Manifesto of the party itself.
 To this end, Communists of various nation-
 alities have assembled in London, and sketched
 the following Manifesto, to be published in the
 English, French, German, Italian, Flemish and
 Danish languages.
 BOURGEOIS AND PROLETARIANSa
 The history of all hitherto existing societyb
 is the history of class struggles.
 a By bourgeoisie is meant the class of modern Cap-
 italists, owners of the means of social production and
 employers of wage labour.  By proletariat, the class
 of modern wage-labourers who, having no means of pro-
 duction of their own, are reduced to selling their labour
 power in order to live.  (Note by Engels to the English
 edition of 1888.]
 b That is, all written history. In 1847, the prehis-
 tory of society, the social organisation existing previous
 to recorded history, was all but unknown.  Since then,
 Haxthausen discovered common ownership of  land in
 Russia, Maurer proved it to be the social foundation
 from which all Teutonic races started in history, and
 by and bye village communities were found to be, or to
 have been the primitive form of society everywhere
 from India to Ireland. The inner organisation of this
 primitive Communistic society was laid bare, in its
 typical form, by Morgan's crowning discovery of the
 true nature of the gees and its relation to the tribe.
 With the dissolution of these primaeval communities
 society begins to be differentiated into separate and fi-
 nally antagonistic classes. I have attempted to retrace
 this process of dissolution in: ?Der Ursprung der Fami-

 MANIFESTO OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY
 Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian,
 lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in
 a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in con-
 stant opposition to one another, carried on an
 uninterrupted,  now hidden, now open fight, a
 fight that each time ended, either in a revolution-
 ary re-constitution of society at large, or in the
 common ruin of the contending classes.
 In the earlier epochs of history, we find al-
 most everywhere a complicated arrangement of
 society into various orders, a manifold gradation
 of social rank. In ancient Rome we have patri-
 cians, knights, plebeians, slaves; in the Middle
 Ages, feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, jour-
 neymen, apprentices, serfs; in almost all of these
 classes, again, subordinate gradations.
 The modern bourgeois society that has sprout-
 ed from the ruins of feudal society has not done
 away with class antagonisms. It has but estab-

 BOURGEOIS AND PROLETARIANS
 lisped new classes, new conditions of oppression,
 new forms  of struggle  in  place  of  the  old
 ones.
 Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, pos- `
 sesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has
 simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a
 whole is more and more splitting up into two
 great hostile camps, into two great classes direct-
 ly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.
 From the serfs of the Middle Ages sprang the
 chartered burghers of the earliest towns. From
 these burgesses the first elements of the bour-
 geoisie were developed.
 The discovery of America, the rounding of the
 Cape, opened up fresh ground for the rising bour-
 geoisie. The Fast-Indian and Chinese markets,
 the colonisation of America, trade with the colo-
 nies, the increase in the means of exchange and
 in commodities generally, gave to commerce, to
 navigation, to industry, an impulse never before
 known, and thereby, to the revolutionary element
 in the tottering feudal society, a rapid develop-
 ment.

 industrial production was monopolised by closed

 guilds, now no longer sufficed for the growing
 wants  of  the new markets.  The manufactur-
 ing system took its place.                                            The guild-masters
 were pushed on one side by the manufacturing
 middle class;  division of labour between the
 different corporate guilds vanished in the face
 of  division of labour  in                     each  single  work-
 shop.
 Meantime the markets kept ever growing, the
 demand ever rising. Even manufacture no long-
 er sufficed. Thereupon, steam and machinery
 revolutionised industrial production. The place
 of manufacture was taken by the giant, Modern
 Industry, the place of the  industrial middle
 class, by industrial millionaires,  the leaders of
 whole industrial armies, the modern bourgeois.
 Modern industry has established the world
 market, for which  the discovery  of  America
 paved the way. This market has given an im-
 mense development to commerce, to navigation,
 to communication by land. This development
 has, in its turn, reacted on the extension of in-
 dustry; and in proportion as industry, commerce,
 navigation, railways extended, in the same pro-
 portion the bourgeoisie developed, increased its
 54
 BOURGEOIS AND PROLETARIANS
 capital, and pushed into the background every
 class handed down from the Middle Ages.
 We see, therefore, how the modern bourgeoi-
 sie is itself the product of a long course of devel-
 opment, of a series of revolutions in the modes
 of production and of exchange.
 Each step in the development of the bourgeoi-
 sie was accompanied by a corresponding political
 advance of that class. An oppressed class under
 the sway of the feudal nobility, an armed and
 self-governing association in the mediaeval com-
 muned here independent urban republic (as in
 Italy and Germany), there taxable "third estate"
 of the. monarchy (as in France), afterwards, in
 the period of manufacture proper, serving either
 d "Commune" was the name taken, in France,. by
 the nascent towns even :before they had conquered from
 their feudal lords and masters local self-government
 and political rights as the "Third  Estate." Generally
 speaking, for the economical development of the bour-
 geoisie, England is here taken as the typical country;
 for its political development, Fraice. [Note by .'ngels
 -
 to the English edition of 1888.1
 This was the name .given their urban communities
 by the townsmen of Italy and France, after they had
 purchased- or wrested their: initial rights of self-govern-
 ment from their feudal lords. [Note by Engels to the

 the semi-feudal or the absolute monarchy as a
 counterpoise against the nobility, and, in fact,
 corner-stone of the great monarchies in general,
 the bourgeoisie has at last, since the establish-
 ment of Modern Industry and of the world mar-
 ket, conquered for itself, in the modern represent-
 ative State, exclusive political sway. The exec-
 utive of the modern State is but a committee
 for managing the common affairs of the whole
 bourgeoisie.
 The bourgeoisie, historically, has played a
 most revolutionary part.
 The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the up-
 per hand, has put an end to all feudal, patriar-
 chal, idyllic relations. It has pitilessly torn asun-
 der the moldy feudal ties that hound man to his
 "natural superiors," and has left remaining no
 other nexus between man and man than naked
 self-interest, than callous "cash payment." It has
 drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious
 fervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine
 sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical
 calculation. It has resolved personal worth into
 exchange value, and in place of the numberless
 indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that
 56
 BOURGEOIS AND PROLETARIANS
 single, unconscionable freedom-Free Trade. In
 one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and
 political illusions,  it has  substituted  naked,
 shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.
 The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every
 occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to
 with reverent awe. It has converted the physician,
 the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of
 science, into its paid wage-labourers.
 The bourgeoisie has torn away from the fam-
 ily its sentimental veil, and has reduced the
 family relation to a mere money relation.
 The bourgeoisie has disclosed how it came to
 pass that the brutal display of vigour in the Mid-
 dle Ages,  which  Reactionists so much admire,
 found its fitting complement in the most slothful
 indolence. It has been the first to spew what
 man's activity can bring about. It has accom-
 plished wonders far surpassing Egyptian pyra-
 mids, Roman aqueducts, and Gothic cathedrals; it
 has conducted expeditions that put in the shade
 all former Exoduses of nations and crusades.
 The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constant-
 ly revolutionising the instruments of production,
 and thereby the relations of production, and with

 them the whole relations of society. Conservation
 of the old modes of production in unaltered form,
 was, on the contrary, the first condition of exist-
 ence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant
 revolutionising of production, uninterrupted dis-
 turbance of all social conditions, everlasting un-
 certainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois
 epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast-frozen
 relations, with their train of ancient and vener-
 able prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all
 new-formed ones become antiquated before they
 can ossify. All that is solid melts into air,  all
 that is holy is profaned, and man is at last
 compelled to face with sober senses, his real con-
 ditions of life, and his relations with his kind.
 The need of a constantly expanding market
 for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the
 whole surface of the globe. It must nestle every-
 where, settle everywhere, establish connexions
 everywhere.
 The bourgeoisie has through its exploitation
 of the world market given a cosmopolitan char-
 acter to production and consumption in every
 country. To the great chagrin of Reactionists, it
 has drawn from under the feet of industry the

 national ground on which it stood. All old-estab-
 lished national industries have been destroyed or
 are daily being destroyed. They are dislodged by
 new industries, whose introduction becomes a
 life and death question for all civilised nations,
 by industries that no longer work up indigenous
 raw material, but raw material drawn from the
 remotest zones; industries whose products are
 consumed, not only at home, but in every quarter
 of the globe. In place of the old wants, satisfied
 by the productions of the country, we find new
 wants, requiring for their satisfaction the prod-
 ucts of distant lands and climes. In place of the
 old local and national seclusion and self-sufficien-
 cy, we have intercourse in every direction, uni-
 versal inter-dependence of nations. And as in ma-
 terial, so also in intellectual production. The in-
 tellectual creations of individual nations become
 common property. National one-sidedness and
 narrow-mindedness become more and more im-
 possible, and from the numerous national and
 local literatures, there arises a world literature.
 The bourgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of
 all instruments of production, by the immensely
 facilitated means' of communication, draws all,

 even the most barbarian, nations into civilisation.
 The cheap prices of its commodities are the heavy
 artillery with which it batters down all Chinese
 walls, with which it forces the barbarians' intense-
 ly obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate.
 It compels all nations, on pain of extinction, to
 adopt  the  bourgeois  mode  of production;  it
 compels them to introduce what it calls civilisa-
 tion into their midst., i.e., to become bourgeois
 themselves. In one word, it creates a world af-
 ter its own image.
 The bourgeoisie has subjected the country to
 the rule of the towns. It has created enormous
 cities, has greatly increased the urban popula-
 tion as compared with the rural, and has thus
 rescued a considerable part of the population
 from the idiocy of rural life. Just as it has made
 th.e country dependent on the towns, so it has
 made barbarian and semi-barbarian countries de-
 pendent on the civilised ones, nations of peasants
 on nations of bourgeois, the East on the West.
 The bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing
 away with the scattered state of the population,
 of the means of production, and of property. It
 has agglomerated population, centralised means
 60
 BOURGEOIS AND PROLETARIANS
 of production, and has concentrated property in
 a few hands. The necessary consequence of this
 was political centralisation. Independent, or but
 loosely connected provinces, with separate in-
 terests, laws, governments and systems of taxa-
 tion, became lumped together into one nation,
 with one government, one code of laws, one na-
 tional class-interest, one frontier and one cus-
 to ms-tariff.
 The bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one
 hundred years, has created more massive and
 more colossal productive forces than have all
 preceding generations  together.  Subjection  of
 Nature's forces to man, machinery, application
 of chemistry to industry and agriculture, steam-
 navigation, railways, electric telegraphs,                                                                                                clear-
 ing of whole continents for cultivation, canalisa-
 tion of rivers, whole populations conjured out of
 the ground what earlier century had even a pre-
 sentiment that such productive forces slumbered
 in the lap of social labour?
 We see then: the means of production and of
 exchange, on whose foundation the bourgeoisie
 built itself up, were generated in feudal society.
 At a certain stage in the development of these

 MANIFESTO OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY
 means of production and of exchange, the condi-
 tions under which feudal society produced and
 exchanged, the feudal organisation of agricul-
 ture and manufacturing industry, in one word,
 the feudal relations of property became no longer
 compatible with the already developed produc-
 tive forces; they became so many fetters. They
 had to be burst asunder; they were burst asunder.
 Into their place stepped free competition, ac-
 companied by a social and political constitution
 adapted to it, and by the economical and polit-
 ical sway of the bourgeois class.
 A similar movement is going on before our
 own eyes. Modern bourgeois society with its rela-
 tions of production, of exchange and of property,
 a society that has conjured  up such gigantic
 means of production and of exchange, is like the
 sorcerer, who is no longer able to control the pow-
 ers of the nether world whom he has called up
 by his spells. For many a decade past the history
 of industry and commerce is but the history of
 the revolt of modern productive forces against
 modern conditions of production, against the
 property relations that are the conditions for
 the existence of the bourgeoisie and of its rule.
 62
 63
 $OURGEOIS AND PROLETARIANS
 It is enough to mention the commercial crises that
 by their periodical return put on its trial, each
 time more threateningly, the existence of the
 entire bourgeois society. In these crises a great
 part not only of the existing products, but also
 of the previously created productive forces, are
 periodically  destroyed.  In  these crises  there
 breaks out an epidemic that, in all earlier epochs,
 would have seemed an absurdity-the epidemic
 of over-production. Society suddenly finds itself
 put back into a state of momentary barbarism;
 it appears as if a famine, a universal war of de-
 vastation had cut off the supply of every means
 of subsistence; industry and commerce seem to
 be destroyed; and why? Because there is too
 much civilisation, too much means of subsist-
 ence, too much industry, too much commerce.
 The productive forces at the disposal of society
 no longer tend to further the development of
 the conditions of bourgeois property; on the con-
 trary, they have become too powerful for these
 conditions, by which they are fettered, and so
 soon as they overcome these fetters, they bring
 disorder into  the whole of bourgeois society,
 endanger the existence of bourgeois property.

 MANIFESTO OF THE. COMMUNIST PARTY
 The conditions of bourgeois society are too narrow
 to comprise the wealth created by them. And
 how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises?
 On the one hand by enforced destruction of a
 mass of productive forces; on the other, by the
 conquest of new markets, and by the more thor-
 ough exploitation of the old ones. That is to
 say, by paving the way for more extensive and
 more destructive crises, and by diminishing the
 means whereby crises are prevented.
 The  weapons  with  which  the bourgeoisie
 felled feudalism to the ground are now turned
 against the bourgeoisie itself.
 But not only has the bourgeoisie forged the
 weapons that bring death to itself; it has also
 called into existence the men who are to wield
 those weapons -the modern working class -the
 proletarians.
 In proportion as the bourgeoisie, i.e., capital,
 is developed, in the same proportion is the pro-
 letariat, the modern working class, developed -a
 class of labourers, who live only so long as they
 find work, and who find work only so long as
 their labour increases capital. These labourers,
 who must sell themselves piecemeal, are a com-
 64
 BOURGEOIS AND PROLETARIANS
 modity, like every other article  of commerce,
 and are consequently exposed to all the vicis-
 situdes of competition, to all the fluctuations of
 the market.
 Owing to the extensive use of machinery and
 to division of labour, the work of the proletar-
 ians has lost all individual character, and, con-
 sequently, all charm for the workman. He be-
 comes an appendage of the machine, and it is only
 the most simple, most monotonous, and most
 easily acquired knack, that is required of him.
 Hence, the cost of production of a workman is
 restricted, almost entirely, to the means of sub-
 sistence that he requires for his maintenance, and
 for the propagation of his race. But the  price
 of a commodity, and therefore also of labour,i
 is equal to its cost of production. In proportion,
 therefore, as the repulsiveness of the work in-
 creases, the wage decreases. Nay more, in propor-
 tion as the use of machinery and division of
 Subsequently Marx pointed out that the worker
 does not sell his labour but his labour power. See in

 MANIFESTO OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY
 labour increases, in the same proportion the bur-
 den of toil also increases, whether by prolongation
 of the working hours, by increase of the work
 exacted in a given time or by increased speed
 of the machinery, etc.
 Modern industry has converted  the little
 workshop of the patriarchal master into the great
 factory of the industrial capitalist. Masses of
 labourers, crowded into the factory, are organ-
 ised like soldiers. As privates of the industrial
 army they are placed under the command of a
 perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants.  Not
 only are they slaves of the bourgeois class, and
 of the bourgeois State; they are daily and hourly
 enslaved by the machine, by the over-looker,
 and, above all, by the individual bourgeois man-
 ufacturer himself.  The more openly  this des-
 potism proclaims gain to be its end and aim,
 the more petty, the more hateful and the more
 embittering it is.
 The less the skill and exertion of strength
 implied in manual labour, in other words, the
 more modern industry becomes developed, the
 more is the labour of men superseded by that of
 women. Differences of age and sex have no long-
 66
 BOURGEOIS AND PROLETAIIIANS
 er any distinctive social validity for the working
 class. All are instruments of labour, more or less
 expensive to use, according to their age and sex.
 No sooner is the exploitation of the labourer
 by the manufacturer, so far, at an end, that he
 receives his wages in cash, than he is set upon
 by the other portions of the bourgeoisie, the
 landlord, the shopkeeper, the pawnbroker, etc.
 The lower strata of the middle class -the
 small  tradespeople,  shopkeepers,  and  retired
 tradesmen generally,  the handicraftsmen and
 peasants-all these sink gradually into the prole-
 tariat, partly because their diminutive capital
 does not suffice for the scale on which Modern In-
 dustry is carried on, and is swamped in the com-
 petition with the large capitalists, partly because
 their specialised skill is rendered worthless by
 new methods of production. Thus the proletariat
 is recruited from all classes of the population.
 The proletariat goes through various stages
 of development. With its birth begins its strug-
 gle with the bourgeoisie. At first the contest is
 carried on by individual labourers, then by the
 workpeople of a factory, then by the operatives
 of one trade, in one locality, against. the i.ndivid-
 b~                                  67

 ual bourgeois who directly exploits them. They
 direct their attacks not against the bourgeois
 conditions of production, but against the instru-
 ments of production themselves; they destroy im-
 ported wares that compete with their labour,
 they smash to pieces machinery, they set facto-
 ries ablaze, they seek to restore by force the van-
 ished status of the workman of the Middle Ages.
 At this stage the labourers still form an inco-
 herent mass scattered over the whole country,
 and broken up by their mutual competition. If
 anywhere they unite  to  form  more  compact
 bodies, this is not yet the consequence of their
 own active union, but of the union of the bour-
 geoisie, which  class,  in                            order to  attain its
 own political ends, is compelled to set the whole
 proletariat in motion, and is moreover yet, for
 a time, able to do so. At this stage, therefore,
 the proletarians do not fight their enemies, but
 the enemies of their enemies, the remnants of
 absolute monarchy, the landowners, the non-
 industrial bourgeois, the petty bourgeoisie. Thus
 the whole historical movement is concentrated
 in the hands of the bourgeoisie; every victory
 so obtained is a victory for the bourgeoisie.
 BOURGEOIS AND PHOLETARIANS
 But with the development of industry the
 proletariat not only increases  in number;  it
 becomes   concentrated   in   greater  masses,
 its strength grows, and it feels that strength
 more. The various interests and conditions of
 life within the ranks of the proletariat are more
 and more equalised, in proportion as machinery
 obliterates all distinctions of labour, and nearly
 everywhere reduces wages to the same low level.
 The growing competition among the bourgeois,
 and the resulting commercial crises, make the
 wages of the workers ever more fluctuating. The
 unceasing improvement of machinery, ever more
 rapidly developing, makes their livelihood more
 and more precarious; the collisions between in-
 dividual workmen and individual bourgeois take
 more and more the character of collisions be-
 tween two classes. Thereupon the workers be-
 gin  to  form  combinations  (Trades'  Unions)
 against the bourgeois; they club together in
 order to keep up the rate of wages; they found
 permanent  associations in order  to make
 provision beforehand for these occasional revolts.
 Here and  there  the contest breaks  out into
 riots.

 1ANIFEST0 OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY
 Now and then the workers are victorious,
 but only for a time. The real fruit of their bat-
 tles lies, not in the immediate result, but in the
 ever-expanding union of the workers. This union
 is helped on by the improved means of com-
 munication that are created by  modern  indus-
 try and that place the workers of different lo-
 calities in contact with one another. It was just
 this contact that was needed to centralise the
 numerous local struggles, all of the same char-
 acter, into one national struggle between classes.
 But every class struggle is a political struggle.
 And that union, to attain which the burghers
 of the  Middle Ages, with their miserable high-
 ways, required centuries, the modern proletar-
 ians, thanks to railways, achieve in a few years.
 This organisation of the proletarians into a
 class, and consequently into a political party, is
 continually being upset again by the competi-
 tion   between the workers themselves.  But it
 ever rises up again, stronger, firmer, mightier.
 It compels legislative recognition of particular
 interests of the workers, by taking advantage
 of the divisions among the bourgeoisie itself.
 Thus the ten-hours' bill in England was carried.

 BOURGEOIS AND PROLETARIANS
 Altogether collisions between the classes of
 the old society further,  in  many ways,  the
 course of development of the proletariat. The
 bourgeoisie finds itself involved in a constant
 battle. At first with the aristocracy; later on,
 with those portions of the bourgeoisie itself,
 whose  interests  have  become  antagonistic to
 the progress of industry; at all times, with the
 bourgeoisie of foreign countries.  In all these
 battles it sees itself compelled to appeal to the
 proletariat, to ask for its help, and thus, to drag
 it into the political arena. The bourgeoisie it-
 self, therefore, supplies the proletariat with its
 own elements of political and general education,
 in other words, it furnishes the proletariat with
 weapons for  fighting the bourgeoisie.
 Further, as we have already seen, entire sec=
 tions of the ruling classes are, by the advance of
 industry, precipitated into the proletariat, or
 are at least threatened in their conditions of
 existence. These also supply the proletariat with
 fresh elements of enlightenment and progress.
 Finally, in times when the  class  struggle
 nears the decisive hour, the process of dissolu
 Lion going on within the ruling class, in fact
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 MANIFESTO OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY
 within the whole range of old society, assumes
 such a violent, glaring character, that a small sec-
 tion of the ruling class cuts itself adrift, and joins
 the revolutionary class, the class that holds the fu-
 ture in its hands. Just as, therefore, at an earlier
 period, a section of the nobility went over to the
 bourgeoisie, so now a portion of the bourgeoisie
 goes over to the proletariat, and in particular,
 a portion of the bourgeois ideologists, who have
 raised themselves to the level of comprehending
 theoretically  the historical  movement  as  a
 whole.
 Of all the classes that stand face to face with
 the bourgeoisie today, the proletariat alone is a
 really revolutionary class. The other classes de-
 cay and finally disappear in the face of modern
 industry; the proletariat is its special and essen-
 tial product.
 The lower middle class, the small manufac-
 turer, the shopkeeper, the artisan, the peasant,
 all these fight against the bourgeoisie, to save
 from extinction their existence as fractions of the
 middle class. They are therefore not revolution-
 ary, but conservative. Nay more, they are reac-
 tionary, for they try to roll back the wheel of his-
 72

 BOURGEOIS AND PROLETARIAN S
 Cory. If by chance they are revolutionary, they
 are so only in view of their impending transfer
 into the proletariat, they thus defend not their
 present, but their future interests, they desert
 their own                                standpoint to  place themselves  at
 that of the proletariat.
 The "dangerous class," the social scum, that
 passively rotting mass thrown off by the lowest
 layers of old society, may, here arid there, be
 swept into the movement by a proletarian revo-
 lution; its conditions of life, however, prepare
 it far more for the part of a bribed tool of reac-
 tionary intrigue.
 In the conditions of the proletariat, those of
 old  society  at  large  are  already  virtually
 swamped. The proletarian is without property; his
 relation to his wife and children has no longer
 anything in common with the bourgeois family
 relations;  modern  industrial  labour,   modern
 subjection to capital, the same in England as in
 France, in America as in Germany, has stripped
 him of every trace of national character. Law,
 morality, religion, are to him so many bourgeois
 prejudices, behind which lurk in ambush just
 as many bourgeois interests.

 MANIFESTO OF THE COMri1JNIST PARTY
 All the preceding classes that got the upper
 hand, sought to fortify their already acquired sta-
 tus by subjecting society at large to their condi-
 tions of appropriation. The proletarians cannot
 become masters of the productive forces of socie-
 ty, except by abolishing their own previous mode
 of appropriation, and thereby also every other
 previous mode of appropriation. They have noth-
 ing of their own to secure and to fortify; their
 mission is to destroy all previous securities for,
 and insurances of, individual property.
 All previous historical movements were move-
 ments of minorities, or in the interest of minori-
 ties. The proletarian movement is the self-con-
 scious, independent movement of the immense
 majority, in the interest of the immense majority.
 The  proletariat,  the  lowest stratum  of  our
 present society, cannot stir,  cannot raise itself
 up,  without the whole superincumbent strata
 of official society being sprung into the air.
 Though not in substance, yet in form, the
 struggle of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie
 is at first a national struggle. The proletariat of
 each country must, of course, first of all settle
 matters with its own bourgeoisie.
 BOURGEOIS AND PROLETARIANS
 In depicting the most general phases of the
 development of the proletariat, we traced the
 more or less veiled civil war, raging within exist-
 ing society,  up to the point where that war
 breaks out into open revolution, and where the
 violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays the
 foundation for the sway of the proletariat.
 Hitherto, every form of society has been
 based, as we have already seen, on the antagonism
 of oppressing and oppressed classes. But in order
 to oppress a class, certain conditions must be
 assured to it under which it can, at least, con-
 tinue its slavish existence. The serf, in the period
 of serfdom, raised himself to membership in the
 commune, just as the petty bourgeois, under the
 yoke of feudal absolutism, managed to develop
 into a bourgeois. The modern labourer, on the
 contrary, instead of rising with the progress of
 industry, sinks deeper and deeper below the con-
 ditions of existence of his own class. He becomes
 a pauper, and pauperism develops more rapidly
 than population and wealth. And here it becomes
 evident, that the bourgeoisie is unfit any longer
 to be the ruling class in society, and to impose
 its conditions of existence upon society as an

 over-riding law. It is unfit to rule because it is
 incompetent to assure an existence to its slave
 within his slavery, because it cannot help let-
 ting him sink into such a state, that it has to feed
 him, instead of being fed by him. Society can no
 longer live under this bourgeoisie, in other words,
 its existence is no longer compatible with society.
 The essential condition for the existence, and
 for the sway of the bourgeois class, is the forma-
 tion and augmentation of capital; the condition
 for capital is wage labour. Wage labour rests
 exclusively on competition between the labour-
 ers. The advance of industry, whose involun-
 tary promoter is the bourgeoisie, replaces the
 isolation of the labourers, due to competition, by
 their revolutionary combination, due to associa-
 tion. The development of Modern Industry, there-
 fore, cuts from under its feet the very founda-
 tion                      on which  the  bourgeoisie produces  and
 appropriates  products.  What  the bourgeoisie,
 therefore, produces, above all, is its own grave-
 diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletar-
 iat are equally inevitable.

 PROLETARIANS AND COMMUNISTS
 In what relation do the Communists stand
 to the proletarians as a whole?
 The Communists do not form a separate par-
 ty opposed to other working-class parties.
 They have no interests separate  and apart
 from those of the proletariat as a whole.
 They do not set up any sectarian principles
 of their own, by which to shape and mould the
 proletarian movement..
 The Communists are distinguished from the
 other working-class parties by this only: 1. In
 the national struggles of the proletarians of the
 different countries, they point out and bring to
 the front the common interests of the entire
 proletariat,  independently  of  all  nationality.
 2. In the various stages of development which
 the struggle of the working class against the bour-
 geoisie has to pass through,                                                                                               they always and

 everywhere represent the interests of the move-
 ment as a whole.
 The Communists, therefore, are on the one
 hand, practically, the most advanced and res-
 olute section                                            of  the working-class  parties of
 every country, that section which pushes  for-
 ward all others; on the other  hand, theoreti-
 cally, they have over the great mass of the pro-
 letariat the advantage of clearly understanding
 the line of march, the conditions, and the ulti-
 mate general results of the proleta; ian move-
 ment.
 The immediate aim of the Communists is
 the same as that of all the other proletarian par-
 ties: formation of the proletariat into a class,
 overthrow of the  bourgeois  supremacy,  con-
 quest of political power by the proletariat.
 The theoretical conclusions of the Commu-
 nists are in no way based on ideas or principles
 that have been invented, or discovered, by this
 or that would-be universal reformer.
 They merely express, in general terms, actu-
 al relations springing from an existing class
 struggle, from a historical movement going on
 under our very eyes. The abolition  of existing

 property relations is not at all a distinctive feat-
 ure of Communism.
 All property relations in the past have con-
 tinually been subject to historical change conse-
 quent upon the change in historical conditions.
 The French Revolution, for example, abol-
 ished feudal property in favour  of bourgeois
 property.
 The distinguishing feature of Communism is
 not the abolition of property generally, but the
 abolition of bourgeois property. But  modern
 bourgeois private property is the final and most
 complete expression of the system of producing
 and appropriating products, that is based on class
 antagonisms, on the exploitation of the many by
 the few.
 In this sense, the theory of the Communists
 may be summed up  in the single sentence:
 Abolition of private property.
 We Communists have been reproached with
 the desire of abolishing the right of personally
 acquiring property as the fruit of a man's own
 labour, which property is alleged to be the ground
 work of all personal freedom, activity and inde-
 pendence.

 Capital is, therefore, not a personal, it is a
 social power.
 When, therefore, capital is converted into
 common property, into the property of all mem-
 bers of society, personal property is not thereby
 transformed into social property. It is only the
 social character of the property that is changed.
 It loses its class character.
 Let us now take wage labour.
 The average price of wage labour is the min-
 imum  wage,  i.e., that quantum of the means
 of subsistence, which is absolutely requisite to
 keep the labourer in  bare  existence  as  a  la-
 bourer. What, therefore, the wage-labourer appro-
 priates by means of his labour, merely suffices
 to  prolong  and reproduce  a  bare    existence.
 We by no means intend to abolish this personal
 appropriation of the products of labour, an ap-
 propriation that is made for the maintenance
 and reproduction of human life, and that leaves
 no surplus wherewith to command the labour
 of others. All that we want to do away with,
 is the miserable character of this appropriation,
 under which the labourer lives  merely to in-
 crease capital, and is allowed to live only in so

 MANIFESTO OF TILE COMMUNIST PARTY
 Hard-won, self-acquired,  self-earned prop-
 erty! Do you mean  the property of the petty
 artisan and of the small peasant, a form of prop-
 erty that preceded the bourgeois form? There
 is no need to abolish that; the development of
 industry has to a great extent already destroyed
 it, and is still destroying it daily.
 Or do you mean modern bourgeois private
 property?
 But does wage labour create any property
 for the labourer? Not a bit. It creates capital, i.e.,
 that kind of property which exploits wage labour,
 and which cannot increase except upon condi-
 tion of begetting a new supply of wage labour
 for fresh exploitation. Property, in its present
 form, is based on the antagonism of capital and
 wage labour. Let us examine both sides of this
 antagonism.
 To be a capitalist, is to have riot only a
 purely personal; but a social status in production.
 Capital  is a collective  product,  and  only by
 the united action of many  members, nay, in
 the last resort, only by the united action of
 all members of society, can it be set in mo-
 tion.

 MANIFESTO OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY
 PROLETARIANS AND COMMUNISTS
 far as the interest  of the ruling class requires
 it.
 In bourgeois society, living labour is but a
 means to increase accumulated labour. In Coni-
 munist society,  accumulated labour is but a
 means to widen, to enrich, to promote the exist-
 ence of the labourer.
 In bourgeois society, therefore, the past dom-
 inates the present;  in Communist society, the
 present dominates the past. In bourgeois socie-
 ty capital is independent and has individuality,
 while the living person is dependent and has
 no individuality.
 And the abolition of this state of things is
 called by the bourgeois, abolition of individual-
 ity and freedom! And rightly so. The abolition
 of bourgeois individuality, bourgeois independ-
 ence,  and  bourgeois freedom  is undoubtedly
 aimed at.
 By freedom is meant, under the present bour-
 geois conditions of production, free trade, free
 selling and buying.
 But if selling and buying disappears, free sell-
 ing and buying disappears also. This talk about
 free selling and buying, and all the other "brave
 82
 words" of our bourgeoisie about freedom in gen-
 eral, have a meaning, if any, only in contrast
 with restricted selling and buying, with the fet-
 tered traders of the Middle Ages, but have no mean-
 ing when opposed to the Communistic abolition
 of buying and selling, of the bourgeois conditions
 of production, and of the bourgeoisie itself.
 You  are  horrified at our intending to do
 away with private property. But in your exist-
 ing society, private property is already done
 away with for nine-tenths of the population; its
 existence for the few is solely due to its non-exist-
 ence in the hands of those nine-tenths. You re-
 proach us, therefore, with intending to do away
 with a form of property, the necessary condition
 for whose existence is, the non-existence of any
 property for the immense majority of society.
 In one word, you reproach us with intending
 to do away with your property. Precisely so;
 that is just what we intend.
 From the moment when labour can no long-
 er be converted into capital, money, or rent, into
 a social power capable of being  monopolised,
 i.e., from the moment when individual property
 can no longer be transformed  into bourgeois

 say, individuality vanishes.
 You must, therefore, confess that by "indi-
 vidual" you mean no other person than the bour-
 geois, than the middle-class owner of property.
 This person must, indeed, be swept out of the
 way, and made impossible.
 Communism deprives no man of the power to
 appropriate the products of society; all that it
 does is to deprive him of the power  to sub-
 jugate the labour of others by means of such ap-
 propriation.
 It has been objected that upon the abolition
 of private property all work will  cease, and
 universal laziness will overtake us.
 According to  this, bourgeois society ought
 long ago to have gone to the dogs through sheer
 idleness; for those of its members who work, ac-
 quire nothing, and those who acquire anything,
 do not work. The whole of this objection is but
 another expression of the tautology; that there
 can no longer be any wage labour when there is
 no longer any capital.

 to admit in the case of your own bourgeois form

 Abolition of the family! Even the most rad-
 ical flare up at this infamous proposal of the
 Communists.
 On what foundation is the present family,
 the bourgeois family, based? On capital, on pri-
 vate gain.  In its completely developed form
 this family exists only among the bourgeoisie.
 But this state of things finds its complement in
 the practical absence of the family among the
 proletarians,  and  in  public prostitution.
 The bourgeois family will vanish as a matter
 0f course  when  its  complement  vanishes,
 and both   will vanish  with the vanishing of
 capital.
 Do you charge us with wanting to stop the
 exploitation of children by their parents? To
 this crime we plead guilty.

 PROLETAH1ANS AND COMMUNISTS
 But, you will say, we destroy the most hal-
 lowed of relations, when we replace home educa-
 tion by social.
 And your education! Is not that also social,
 and  determined by the social conditions under
 which you educate, by the intervention, direct
 or indirect, of society, by means of schools, &c?
 The Communists have not invented the interven-

 to alter the character of that intervention, and to
 rescue education from the influence of the rul-

 The bourgeois clap-trap about the family
 and education, about the hallowed co-relation of
 parent and child, becomes all the more disgust-

 all family ties among the proletarians are torn

 ments of production are to be exploited in com-
 mon, and, naturally, can come to no other con-
 clusion than that the lot of being common to
 all will likewise fall to the women.
 He has not even a suspicion that the real
 point aimed at is to do away with the status
 of women as mere instruments of production.
 For the rest, nothing is more ridiculous than
 the virtuous indignation of our bourgeois at the
 community of women which, they pretend, is
 to be openly and officially established by the
 Communists. The Communists have no need to
 introduce community of women; it has existed
 almost from time immemorial.
 Our bourgeois, not content with having the
 wives and  daughters of  their proletarians at
 their disposal, not to speak of common prosti-
 tutes, take the greatest pleasure  in seducing
 each others' wives.
 Bourgeois marriage is in reality a system of
 wives in common and thus, at the most, what
 the Communists might possibly be reproached
 with, is that they desire to introducer in sub-
 stitution for a hypocritically concealed, an open-
 ly legalised community of women. For the rest,
 88
 PROLETARIANS AND COMMUNISTS
 it is self-evident that the abolition of the present
 system of production must bring with it the abo-
 lition of the community of women springing
 from that system, i.e., of prostitution both pub-
 lic and private.
 The Communists are further reproached with
 desiring to abolish countries and nationality.
 The working men have no country. We can-
 not take from them what they have not got.
 Since the proletariat must first of all acquire
 political supremacy, must rise to be the lead-
 ing class 'of the nation,  must constitute itself
 the nation, it is, so far, itself national, though
 not in the bourgeois sense of the word.
 National  differences and  antagonisms  be-
 tween peoples are daily more and more vanish-
 ing, owing to the development of the bourgeoi-
 sie, to freedom of commerce, to the world mar-
 ket, to uniformity in the mode of production and
 in the conditions of life corresponding thereto.
 The  supremacy  of  the  proletariat  will
 cause them to vanish still faster. United action,
 of the leading civilised countries at least, is
 one of the first conditions for the emancipation
 of the proletariat.

 In proportion as the exploitation of one in-
 dividual by another is put an end to, the exploi-
 tation of one nation  by another will also be
 put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism
 between classes within the nation vanishes, the
 hostility of one nation to another will come to
 an end.
 The charges against Communism made from
 a religious, a philosophical, and, generally, from
 an ideological standpoint, are not deserving of
 serious examination.
 Does it require  deep  intuition to compre-
 hend that man's ideas, views and conceptions,
 in one word, man's consciousness, changes with
 every change in the conditions of his material
 existence, in his social relations and in his so-
 cial life?
 What else does the history of ideas prove
 than that intellectual production changes its
 character in proportion as material production is
 changed? The ruling ideas of each age have ever
 been the ideas of its ruling class.
 When people speak of ideas that revolution-
 ise society,  they do but express the fact, that
 within the old society, the elements  of a new

 one have been created, and that the dissolution
 of the old ideas keeps even pace with the disso-
 lution of the old conditions of existence.
 When the ancient world was in its last throes,
 the ancient religions were overcome by Chris-
 tianity. When Christian ideas succumbed in the
 18th century to rationalist ideas, feudal society
 fought its death battle with the then revolu-
 tionary bourgeoisie. The ideas of religious lib-
 erty and freedom of conscience,  merely gave
 expression to the sway of free competition within
 the domain of knowledge.
 "Undoubtedly," it will be said, "religious,
 moral,  philosophical and juridical ideas have
 been modified in the course of historical develop-
 ment. But religion,  morality, philosophy, po-
 litical  science,  and law, constantly survived
 this change. "
 "There are, besides, eternal truths, such as
 Freedom, Justice, etc., that are common to all
 states of society. But Communism abolishes eter-
 nal truths, it abolishes all religion, and all mo-
 rality, instead of constituting them  on a new
 basis;  it therefore acts in contradiction to all
 past historical experience."

 MANIFESTO OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY
 What does this accusation reduce itself to?
 The history of all past society has consisted in
 the development of class  antagonisms, antago-
 nisms that assumed different forms at different
 epochs.
 But whatever form they may have taken,
 one fact is common to all past ages, viz., the
 exploitation of one part of society by the oth-
 er. No wonder, then, that the social conscious-
 ness of past ages, despite all the multiplicity
 and  variety it displays, moves within certain
 common forms, or general ideas, which cannot
 completely vanish except with the total disap-
 pearance of class antagonisms.
 The Communist revolution is the most rad-
 ical rupture  with  traditional  property  rela-
 tions; no wonder that its development involves
 the  most radical  rupture  with traditional
 ideas.
 But let us have done with the bourgeois ob-
 jections to Communism.
 We have seen above, that the first step in the
 revolution by the working class, is to raise the
 proletariat to the position of ruling class, to
 win the battle of democracy.
 The proletariat will use its political suprema-
 cy to wrest, by degrees, all capital from the
 bourgeoisie, to centralise all instruments of pro-
 duction in the hands of the  State, i. e., of the
 proletariat organised as the ruling class; and to
 increase the total of productive forces as rapid-
 ly as possible.
 Of course, in the beginning, this cannot be
 effected except by means of despotic inroads on
 the rights of property, and on the conditions of
 bourgeois production;  by means of measures,
 therefore,  which appear  economically insuffi-
 cient and untenable, but which, in the course of
 the movement, outstrip themselves, necessitate
 further inroads upon the old social order, and
 are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolu-
 tionising the mode of production.
 These measures will of course be different in
 different countries.
 Nevertheless in the most advanced countries,
 the following will be pretty generally applic-
 able.
 it. Abolition of property in land and appli-
 cation  of all rents  of  land  to  public  pur-
 poses.

 boor in its present form. Combination of edu-
 cation with industrial production, &c., &c.
 When, in the course of development, class
 distinctions have disappeared, and all produc-
 tion has been concentrated in the hands of a vast
 association of the whole nation, the public pow-
 er will lose  its  political  character.  Political
 power, properly so called,  is merely the organ-
 ised power of one class for oppressing another.
 If the proletariat during its contest with the
 bourgeoisie is compelled,   by the force of cir-
 cumstances, to organise itself as a class, if, by
 means of a revolution, it makes itself the ruling
 class, and, as such, sweeps away by force the
 old conditions of production, then it will, along
 with these conditions, have swept away the con-
 ditions for the existence of class antagonisms
 and of classes generally, and will thereby have
 abolished its own supremacy as a class.
 In place of the old bourgeois society, with
 its classes and class antagonisms, we shall have
 an association, in which the free development
 of each is the condition for the free development
 of all.

 came the vocation of the aristocracies of France
 and England to write pamphlets against mod-
 ern bourgeois society. In the French revolution
 of July 1.830, and in the English reform agita-
 tion, these aristocracies again succumbed to the
 hateful upstart. Thenceforth, a serious political
 contest  was  altogether  out  of  question.  A
 literary battle  alone  remained possible.  But
 even  in the domain of literature the old cries
 of  the  restoration  perioda had  become im-
 possible.
 a Not the English Restoration 1660 to 1689, but
 the French Restoration 1814 to 1830.  [Note by Engels

 SOCIALIST AND COMMUNIST LITERATURE
 In order to arouse sympathy, the aristocracy
 were obliged to lose sight, apparently, of their
 own interests, and to formulate their indictment
 against the bourgeoisie in the interest of the ex-
 ploited working class alone. Thus the aristocracy
 took their revenge by singing lampoons on their
 new master, and whispering in his ears sinister
 prophecies of coming catastrophe.
 In this way arose feudal Socialism: half lam-
 entation, half lampoon; half echo of the past,
 half menace of the future; at times, by its bitter,
 witty and incisive criticism, striking the bour-
 geoisie to the very heart's core; but always lu-
 dicrous in its effect, through total incapacity to
 comprehend the march of modern history.
 rfhe aristocracy, in order to rally the people
 to  them,  waved the proletarian alms-bag in
 front for a banner. But the people, so often as it
 joined them, saw on their hindquarters the old
 feudal coats of arms, and deserted with loud and
 irreverent laughter.

 In pointing out that their mode of eipioit~ -
 tion was different to that of the bourgeoisie, the
 feudalist.s forget that they exploited under cii--
 cum.stances and conditions that were quite dif-
 ferent, and that are now antiquated. in showi ii
 that, under their rule, the modern proletariat
 never existed, they forget that the modern bour-
 geoisie is the necessary offspring of their own
 form of society.
 For the rest, so little do they conceal the
 reactionary  character  of their  criticism  that
 their chief  accusation against  the bourgeoisie
 amounts to this, that under the~bourgeois regime
 a class is being developed, wlricla is destined to
 cut up root and branch the old order of society.
 What they upbraid the bourgeoisie  with is
 not so much that it creates a proletariat, as that
 it creates a revolutionary proletariat.
 In political practice, therefore, they join in
 all coercive measures against the working class;

 b. Petty-Bourgeois Socialism
 The feudal aristocracy was not the only class
 that was ruined by the bourgeoisie, not the only
 class whose conditions of existence pined and
 perished              in  the  atmosphere of modern bour-
 geois society. The mediaeval burgesses and the
 small  peasant  proprietors  were  the  precur-
 sors of the modern bourgeoisie. In those coun-
 tries which are but little developed, industri-
 ally and commercially, these two classes still
 vegetate  side  by  side with the rising  bour-
 geoisie.
 In countries where modern civilisation has
 become fully developed, a new class of petty
 bourgeois has been formed, fluctuating between
 proletariat and bourgeoisie and ever   renewing
 itself as a supplementary part of bourgeois so-
 ciety. The individual members of this class, how-
 ever,  are  being  constantly  hurled down into
 the proletariat by the action of competition, and,
 as modern industry develops, they even see the
 moment approaching when they will completely
 disappear as an independent section of modern
 society, to be replaced, in manufactures, agri-

 culture and commerce, by over-lookers, bailiffs
 and shopmen.
 In countries like France, where the peasants
 constitute far more than half of the population,
 it was natural that writers who sided with the
 proletariat against the bourgeoisie, should use,
 in their criticism of the bourgeois regime, the
 standard of the peasant and petty bourgeois, and
 from the standpoint of these intermediate classes
 should take up the cudgels for the working class.
 Thus arose petty-bourgeois Socialism. Sismondi
 was the head of this school, not only in France
 but also in England.
 This school of Socialism dissected with great
 acuteness the contradictions in the conditions of
 modern production. It laid bare the hypocritical
 apologies of economists. It proved, incontrovert-
 ibly, the disastrous effects of machinery and di-
 vision of labour; the concentration of capital and
 land in a few hands; overproduction and crises:
 it pointed out the inevitable ruin of the petty
 bourgeois and peasant, the misery of the prole-
 tariat, the anarchy in production, the crying in-
 equalities in the distribution of wealth, the in-
 dustrial war of extermination between nations,

 the dissolution of old moral bonds, of the old
 family relations, of the old nationalities.
 In its positive aims, however, this form of
 Socialism                aspires either to restoring  the  old
 means of production and of exchange, and with
 them the old property relations, and the old so-
 ciety, or to cramping the modern means of pro-
 duction and of exchange, within the framework
 of the old property relations that have been, and
 were bound to be, exploded by those means. In
 either case, it is both reactionary and Utopian.
 Its last words are: corporate guilds for manu-
 facture; patriarchal relations  in agriculture.
 Ultimately, when stubborn historical facts
 had dispersed all intoxicating effects of self-de-
 ception,  this form  of  Socialism  ended  in a
 miserable fit of the blues.
 c. German, or "True," Socialism
 The Socialist and Communist  literature of
 France, a literature that originated under the
 pressure of a bourgeoisie in power, and that was
 the expression of the struggle against  this pow-
 102
 SOCIALIST AND COMMUNIST LITERATURE
 or,  was introduced  into  Germany at  a time
 when the bourgeoisie, in that country, had just
 begun its contest with feudal absolutism.
 German philosophers, would-be philosophers,
 and beaux esprits, eagerly seized on this litera-
 ture, only forgetting, that when these writings
 immigrated from France into Germany, French
 social conditions had not immigrated along with
 them. In contact with German social conditions,
 this French literature lost all its immediate prac-
 tical significance, and assumed a purely  liter-
 ary aspect. Thus, to the German philosophers of
 the Eighteenth Century, the demands of the first
 French Revolution, were nothing more than the
 demands of "Practical Reason" in general, and
 the utterance of the will of the revolutionary
 French bourgeoisie signified in their eyes the
 laws of pure Will, of Will as it was bound to be,
 of true human Will generally.
 rl'he work of the German literati consisted
 solely in bringing the new French ideas into har-
 mony  with  their  ancient  philosophical  con-
 science, or rather, in annexing the French ideas
 without deserting their own philosophic point
 of view.

 MANIFESTO OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY
 This annexation took place in the same wail
 in which a foreign language is appropriated,
 namely, by translation.
 It is well known how the monks wrote silly
 lives of Catholic Saints over the manuscripts on
 which the classical works of ancient heathendom
 had been written. The German literati reversed
 this process with the profane French literature.
 They wrote their philosophical nonsense beneath
 the French original. For instance, beneath the
 French criticism of the economic functions of
 money, they wrote "Alienation of Humanity,"
 and beneath the French criticism of the bour-
 geois State they wrote, "Dethronement of the
 Category of the General," and so forth.
 The introduction of these philosophical phrases
 at the back of the French historical criticisms
 they dubbed "Philosophy of Action," "True So-
 cialism," "German Science of Socialism," "Phil-
 osophical Foundation of Socialism," and so on.
 The French Socialist and Communist litera-
 ture was thus completely emasculated. And, since
 it  ceased in the hands of the German to ex-
 press the struggle of one class with the other, he
 felt conscious of having overcome "French one-
 104

 sidedness" and of representing, not true require-
 merits, but the requirements of Truth; not the
 interests of the proletariat, but the interests of
 Human Nature, of Man in general, who belongs
 to no class, has no reality, who exists only in the
 misty realm of philosophical fantasy.
 This German Socialism, which took its school-
 boy task so seriously and solemnly, and extolled
 its poor  stock-in-trade  in  such  mountebank
 fashion, meanwhile gradually lost its pedantic
 innocence.
 The fight  of the German, and, especially, of
 the Prussian bourgeoisie, against feudal aristoc-
 racy and absolute monarchy, in other words,
 the liberal  movement, became more earnest.
 By this,  the long wished-for opportunity
 was offered to "True" Socialism of confronting
 the political  movement  with  the  Socialist
 demands, of hurling the traditional anathemas
 against liberalism, against representative gov-
 ernment,                                                                                               against bourgeois competition, bour-

 geois movement. German Socialism forgot, in
 the nick of time, that the  French   criticism,
 whose silly echo  it was,  presupposed the  ex-
 istence of modern bourgeois society, with its
 corresponding economic conditions of existence,
 and the political constitution adapted thereto,
 the very things whose attainment was the ob-
 ject of the pending struggle in Germany.
 To the  absolute  governments,  with  their
 following of parsons, professors, country squires
 and officials, it served as a welcome scarecrow
 against the threatening bourgeoisie.
 It was a sweet finish after the bitter pills
 of floggings and bullets with which these same
 governments, just at that time, dosed the Ger-
 man working-class risings.
 While this  "True" Socialism thus  served
 the governments as a weapon for fighting the
 German bourgeoisie, it, at the same time, di-
 rectly represented a reactionary interest,                            the
 interest of the German Philistines. In Germany
 the petty-bourgeois class, a relic of the sixteenth
 century, and since then constantly cropping up
 again under various forms, is the real social
 basis of the existing state of things.
 106
 SOCIALIST AND COMMUNIST LITERATURE
 To preserve this class is to preserve the exist-
 ing state of things in Germany. The industrial
 and political supremacy of the bourgeoisie threat-
 ens it with certain destruction; on the one hand,
 from the concentration of capital; on the other,
 from the rise  of a revolutionary proletariat.
 "True" Socialism appeared  to kill these two
 birds with one stone. It spread like an epidemic.
 The robe of speculative cobwebs, embroidered
 with flowers  of rhetoric,  steeped in the dew
 of sickly sentiment, this transcendental robe in
 which  the  German Socialists wrapped  their
 sorry "eternal truths, " all skin and bone, served
 to wonderfully increase the sale of their goods
 amongst such a public.
 And on its part, German Socialism recog-
 nised, more and more, its own calling as the
 bombastic representative of the petty-bourgeois
 Philistine.
 It proclaimed the German nation to be the
 model nation, and the German petty Philistine
 to be the typical  man.  To every villainous
 meanness of this model man it gave a hidden,
 higher, Socialistic interpretation, the exact con-
 trary of its real character. It went to the ex-

 SOCIALIST AND COMMUNIST LITERATURE
 This form of Socialism has,  moreover,  been
 worked out into complete systems.
 We may cite Proudholl's Pliilosophie de la
 Miserc as an example of this form.
 The Socialistic bourgeois want all the advan-
 tages of modern social  conditions  without the
 struggles and dangers necessarily resulting there-
 from. They desire the existing state of society
 minus its revolutionary and disintegrating ele-
 ments. They wish for a bourgeoisie without a
 proletariat. The bourgeoisie naturally conceives
 the  world  in which it is supreme to be the
 best; and bourgeois Socialism develops this com-
 fortable conception into various  more or less
 complete systems. In requiring the proletariat
 to carry out such a system,  and thereby  to
 march straightway into the social New Jeru-
 salem, it but requires in reality, that the pro-
 letariat should remain within the bounds of
 existing society, but should cast away all its
 hateful ideas concerning the bourgeoisie.
 A second and more practical, but less sys-
 tematic, form of this Socialism sought to. depre-
 ciate every revolutionary movement in the eyes

 By changes in the material conditions of ex-

 means understands abolition of the bourgeois.
 relations of production, an abolition that can
 be effected only by a revolution, but admin-
 istrative reforms, based on the continued ex-
 istence  of  these  relations; reforms,  therefore,
 that in no respect affect the relations between
 capital and labour, but, at the best, lessen the
 cost, and simplify the administrative work, of
 bourgeois government.
 Bourgeois Socialism  attains  adequate ex-
 pression, when, and only when, it becomes a
 mere figure of speech.
 Free trade: for the benefit of the working
 class. Protective duties: for the benefit of the
 working class. Prison Reform: for the benefit
 of the working class. This is the last word and
 the only seriously  meant word of bourgeois
 Socialism.
 It is summed up in the phrase: the bourgeois is
 a bourgeois--for the benefit of the working class.

 SOCIALIST AND COMMUNIST LITERATURE
 3. CRITICAL-UTOPIAN SOCIALISM AND COMMUNISM
 We do note here refer to that literature which,
 in every great modern revolution, has always
 given voice to the demands of the proletariat,
 such as the writings of Babeuf and others.
 The first direct attempts of the proletariat
 to attain its own ends, made in times of univer-
 sal excitement, when feudal society was being
 overthrown, these attempts necessarily  failed,
 owing to the then undeveloped state of the pro-
 letariat, as well as to the absence of the econom-
 ic conditions for its emancipation, conditions
 that had yet to be produced, and could be pro-
 duced by the impending bourgeois epoch alone.
 The revolutionary literature that accompanied
 these first movements of the proletariat had
 necessarily a reactionary character. It inculcated
 universal asceticism and social levelling in its
 crudest form.
 The Socialist and Communist systems prop-
 erly                                                                                           so  called,  those of St. Simon,  Fourier,
 Owen and others, spring into existence in the
 early undeveloped period, described above, of
 the struggle between proletariat and bourgeoi-
 sic (see Section I. Bourgeoisie and Proletariat).

 MANIFESTO OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY
 The founders of these systems see, indeed,
 the class antagonisms, as well as the action of
 the  decomposing  elements                     in  the  prevailing
 form of society. But the proletariat, as yet in
 its infancy, offers to them the spectacle of a
 class without any historical initiative or                     any
 independent political movement.
 Since the development of class antagonism
 keeps even pace with the development of indus-
 try,                           the  economic situation, as they find it,
 does not as yet offer to them the material con-
 ditions for the emancipation of the proletariat.
 They therefore search after a new social science,
 after new social laws, that are to create these
 conditions.
 Historical action is to yield to their personal
 inventive action, historically created conditions
 of emancipation to fantastic ones, and the grad-
 ual, spontaneous class organisation of the pro-
 letariat to an organisation of society specially
 contrived by these inventors.  Future  history
 J
 resolves itself, in their eyes, into  the propa-
 ganda and the practical carrying out of                            their
 social plans.
 In the formation of their plans they       are
 112
 113
 SOCIALIST AND COMMUNIST LITERATURE
 conscious of caring chiefly for the interests of
 the. working class, as being the most suffering
 class. Only from the point of view of being the
 most suffering class does the proletariat  exist
 for them.
 The undeveloped state of the class struggle,
 as well as their own surroundings,  causes So-
 cialists of this kind to consider themselves far
 superior to all class antagonisms. They want to
 improve the condition of every member of so-
 ciety, even, that of the most favoured. Hence,
 they habitually appeal to society at large, with-
 out  distinction  of  class; nay, by preference,
 to the ruling class. For how can people, when
 once they understand their system, fail to see
 in it the best possible plan of the best possible
 state of society?
 Hence, they reject all political, and espe-
 cially all revolutionary, action; they  wish to
 attain their ends by peaceful means, and en-
 deavour,  by  small  experiments,   necessarily
 doomed to failure, and by the force of example,
 to pave the way for the new social Gospel.

 in a very undeveloped state and has but a fan-
 tastic conception of its own position correspond
 with the
 first instinctive yearnings of that class
 for a general reconstruction of society.
 But these Socialist and Communist publica-
 tions contain also a critical element. They attack
 every principle of existing society.  Hence they
 are full of the most valuable materials for the
 enlightenment of the working class. The prac-
 tical measures proposed in them-such as the
 abolition of the distinction between town and
 country, of the family, of the  carrying on of
 industries for the account of private individuals,
 and of the wage system, the proclamation of so-
 cial harmony, the conversion of the functions of
 the State into a mere superintendence of produc-
 tion, all these proposals point solely to the dis-
 appearance of class antagonisms which were, at
 that time, only just cropping up, and which,
 in these publications, ''are recognised in their
 earliest indistinct and undefined forms only.
 These proposals, therefore, are of a purely Uto-
 pian character.
 The significance of Critical-Utopian Socialism

 torical development. In proportion as the mod-
 ern  class  struggle  develops  and  takes defi-
 nite shape, this fantastic standing apart from
 the contest, these fantastic attacks on it, lose
 all practical value and all theoretical justifi-
 cation. Therefore, although the  originators of
 these systems were, in many respects,  revolu-
 tionary,  their disciples have,  in every                                                                                              case,
 formed mere reactionary sects. They hold fast
 by the original views of their masters, in oppo-
 sition to the progressive historical development
 of the proletariat. They, therefore, endeavour,
 and that consistently, to deaden the class strug-
 gle  and  to reconcile  the  class                                                                                         antagonisms.
 They still dream of experimental realisation of
 their social Utopias, of founding isolated "pha-
 lansteres",  of establishing         "Home                                                                                           Colonies,"
 of setting up a "Little Icaria "? -duodecimo edi-

 "I-Tome colonies" were what Owen called his Com-

 POSITION OF THE COMMUNISTS
 IN RELATION
 TO THE VARIOUS EXISTING
 OPPOSITION PARTIES
 Section II has made clear the relations of
 the Communists to the existing working-class
 parties, such as the Chartists in England and
 the Agrarian Reformers in America.
 The Communists fight for the attainment of
 the immediate aims, for the enforcement of the
 momentary interests of the working class; but
 in the movement of the present, they also rep-
 resent and take care of the future of that move-
 ment.  In  France the Communists ally them-
 selves with the Social-Democrats,a against the

 Socialism. [Note by Engels to the English edition of 1888.1

 conservative           and radical bourgeoisie,  reserv-
 ing, however, the right to take up a critical po-
 sition in regard to phrases and illusions tradition-
 ally handed down from the great Revolution.
 In Switzerland they support the Radicals,
 without losing sight of the fact that this party
 consists of antagonistic elements, partly of Dem-
 ocratic Socialists, in the French sense, partly
 of radical bourgeois.
 In Poland they support the party that insists
 on an agrarian revolution as the prime condi-
 tion for national emancipation, that party which
 fomented the insurrection of Cracow in 1846.
 In Germany they fight with the bourgeoisie
 whenever it acts in a revolutionary way, against
 the absolute monarchy, the feudal squirearchy,
 and the petty bourgeoisie.'
 The party in France which at that time called it-
 self Socialist-Democratic was represented in political
 life by Ledru-Rollin and in literature by Louis Blanc;
 thus it differed immeasurably from present-day Ger-
 man Social-Democracy. [Note by Engels to the German
 edition of 1890.)
 1 Kleinbiirgerei in the German original. Marx and
 Engels used this term to describe the reactionary elc-
 ments of the urban petty bourgeoisie.
 POSITION OF THE COMMUNISTS
 But they never cease, for a single instant, to
 instil into the working class the clearest possible
 recognition of the hostile antagonism between
 bourgeoisie  and proletariat, in order that the
 German workers  may straightway use,  as so
 many weapons against the bourgeoisie, the so-
 cial and political conditions that the bourgeoi-
 sie must necessarily introduce along with its
 supremacy, and in order that, after the fall of
 the reactionary classes in Germany, the fight
 against the bourgeoisie itself may immediately
 begin.
 The Communists turn their attention chiefly
 to Germany,  because that country is on the
 eve of a bourgeois revolution that is bound to
 be carried out under more advanced conditions
 of European civilisation, and with a much more
 developed proletariat,  than that  of  England
 was in the seventeenth, and of France in the
 eighteenth century, and because the bourgeois
 revolution in Germany will be but the prelude
 to an immediately following proletarian rev-
 olution.
 In short, the Communists everywhere sup-
 port                                                                                        every  revolutionary  movement  against

 MANIFESTO OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY
 the  existing  social                     and  political  order  of
 things.
 In all these movements they bring to the
 front, as the leading question in each, the prop-
 erty question, no matter what its degree of de-
 velopment at the time.
 Finally, they labour everywhere for the union
 and agreement of the democratic parties of all
 countries.
 The Communists disdain to  conceal their
 views and aims. They openly declare that their
 ends can be attained only by the forcible over-
 throw of all existing social conditions. Let the
 ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolu-
 tion. The proletarians have nothing to lose but
 their chains. They have a world to win.

 of the
 SPEECH MADE BY D. T. SHEPILOV
 U.S.S.R. Foreign Minister
 in the
 U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY
 on November 19, 1956
 J4R. PRESIDENT, GENTLEMEN,
 LYE The Soviet delegation has objected to the inclusion in the
 agenda of the General Assembly session of the question of the
 situation in Hungary. We have been and remain of the opinion
 that this question is an internal affair of the Hungarian People's
 Republic.
 You know that attempts to make use of the United Nations
 for interfering in the internal affairs of Hungary were already
 made at the special emergency session of the General Assembly.
 The Revolutionary Workers' and Peasants' Government of the
 Hungarian People's Republic protested against these attempts.
 In the telegram sent to the United Nations Secretary-General
 on November 12, 1956, Istvan Sebes, acting Foreign Minister
 of Hungary, wrote :
 "The Hungarian  government states most categorically
 that the settlement of the situation that has developed in
 Hungary falls exclusively within the lawful internal juris-
 diction of the Hungarian state. Therefore any resolution of
 the General Assembly, dealing with the internal political
 situation in Hungary, constitutes interference in the internal
 affairs of Hungary and contradicts the provisions of Article
 2, Paragraph 7 of the Charter."
 The persistent efforts to keep the question of the situation in
 Hungary on the agenda of the session of the U.N. General
 Assembly have in no way been prompted by concern for the

 interests of the Hungarian people, but by the intention of certain
 circles to divert public attention from the aggressive actions of
 Britain, France and Israel in Egypt, on the one hand, and to
 encourage the underground reactionary forces in Hungary by
 them United Nations support, on the other.

 Clamour Around
 What Caused the Provocative
 the "Hungarian Issue"
 As for the draft resolution tabled by the Cuban delegation,
 this document smacks of the rotten spirit of provocation. The
 draft contains slanderous allegations that "the government of
 the Soviet Union, with the consent of the Hungarian authorities,
 is forcibly deporting Hungarian prisoners beyond the Hungarian
 borders." Even in the worst period. of the "cold war" it would
 have been difficult to find a document which violated the ele-
 mentary requirements for justifying the accusations to such an
 extent as is the case here.
 In an effort to lend a semblance of truth to the slanderous assertions, the authors of the Cuban draft resolution groundlessly
 refer to a mythical "report of the official Budapest Radio." A
 check-up has shown however, that no such reports have been
 transmitted by Budapest Radio. Therefore the Cuban delegate
 today does not refer to this source. As another "source" of
 information the draft resolution mentions reports of "the entire
 world press." "The entire world press," incidentally, means
 here those press organs which obediently fulfil the orders of the
 reactionary circles and produce all sorts of fabrications about
 the situation in Hungary.
 But today the Cuban delegate is forced to give up referring
 to this source also, because the "world press" does not furnish
 any such authentic facts. What, in that case,                         -
 are the provocative inventions of the
 Cuban delegate based on? On nothing whatsoever. He did not
 bother to prove anything and made filthy insinuations do duty
 for argumentation.
 The references contained in the rehashed draft resolution to
 the alleged violations in Hungary of the convention on the pre
 the punishment for it, pursue the aim
 vention of genocide and                                        -
 of lending a semblance of legality to this provocative document.
 It is known, however, that this convention condemning acts
 committed for the purpose of annihilating people only because
 they belong to this or that national, ethnical, racial or religious
 group, has nothing to do with the situation in Hungary.
 Had the Cuban delegation been seriously concerned with com-
 bating genocide it would have taken some interest in the situation
 in those countries where this monstrous practice is actually in
 evidence.
 See, for instance, what is happening in Kenya. According to
 a Reuter report, a church missionary society stated on June 19
 last year that the Kenya authorities had arrested and detained
 over 500,000 Negroes.
 The American journalist, Gunther, des-
 cribing the operation carried out by the British authorities in
 Kenya against the Kikuyu tribe with the expressive name of
 "anvil," qualified it as one of the most effective manhunts in
 history. A whole army of jailers, 14,300-strong, is maintained
 to guard prisons and concentration camps in Kenya where thou-
 sands upon thousands of innocent people, including women and
 children, are languishing.
 And what is happening in Algeria, where the people are
 gallantly fighting for freedom in spite of the most cruel reprisals?
 Eduard Depres, leader of the Socialist group in the French
 National Assembly, on April 6 made public the following horrify-
 ing figure : he said that according to official statistics 48,000
 Algerians had been annihilated in Algeria by French troops
 since the beginning of the struggle. The Times of India justly
 remarked on this score that if the French government's figure,
 which was an obvious underestimation, were to be believed
 the scale of murder was to be regarded almost as a massacre.
 These are the actions, gentlemen, against which the Cuban
 delegation should have raised its voice, had it really wished to
 combat genocide!
 As for the wild invention that some "Hungarian prisoners,"
 including women and children, are being deported beyond Hun-
 gary's borders, you know that it has been categorically y refuted
 in Budapest-including by Budapest Radio, to which the Cuban
 delegation has so carelessly referred in its original resolution.
 On November 18 the government of the Hungarian Republic
 published an official communique which stated:
 "The panic-mongering rumours that arrested people are
 being transported to the Soviet Union is a provocative

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 invention of the counter-revolutionary circles, which are
 becoming more helpless and powerless. In reality not a
 single arrested person has been deported from Hungary.
 "The purpose of these provocative and false rumours is,
 on the one hand, to sow mistrust towards the government,
 to break the peace of the population and to hamper produc-
 tion, and on the other hand, to try and spoil in this way the
 relations between the  population and the Soviet Army
 units."
 Thus, the myth of the deportation of Hungarian citizens to
 the Soviet Union has collapsed. And yet the Cuban delegation
 permits itself to drag to the General Assembly session this stink-
 ing newspaper canard picked up on the rubbish heap of refuted
 misinformation!  The delegation of  the Hungarian  People's
 Republic has said its weighty word about this unseemly insinua-
 tion. It was this delegation that expounded in detail the essence
 of the so-called Hungarian question.
 We have nothing to discuss as regards the Cuban delegation's
 draft, for it is based on slander. However, since the General
 Assembly has decided to postpone the general discussion and
 immediately to begin the debate on the draft resolution sub-
 mitted by the Cuban delegation, the Soviet delegation finds it
 necessary on its part to give an objective analysis of the situation
 in Hungary.
 For the last few weeks the powerful propaganda machine at
 the disposal of the reactionary forces has been flooding the
 world with monstrous misinformation about the events in Hun-
 gary. Deceiving millions of people, the sponsors of this campaign
 are trying to make political capital and to poison the atmosphere
 around the U.S.S.R.
 This was the origin, for instance, of the monstrous lie that
 the Soviet troops in Budapest ransacked a children's hospital
 and killed hundreds of children there. This falsehood has been
 energetically disseminated in the press throughout the capitalist
 world.  The French       of, for  instance  published  under
 ~'igcrr
 hysterical headlines a falsified "radiogram" from Budapest to the
 effect that Soviet tanks were crushing to death sick children and
 medical nurses trying to save them. On November 11, the United
 Press agency reported the complete destruction of the children's
 hospital in Budapest and alleged that a correspondent had stated
 that later on he saw (!) 300 corpses of children brought out from
 the ruined building.
 This slander was taken up and repeated by many American
 newspapers. Thus, the Daily Mirror and the Washington Post
 published a report from a special correspondent of the North
 American Newspaper Alliance who went
 to such lengths in his
 dishonesty as to state that he had seen corpses of small children
 -approximately 300-lying in rows on the ground by the ruins
 of the hospital.
 This malicious and slanderous campaign. about the children's
 hospital that was raging for many days, and bringing to mind
 the choicest tricks of Goebbels was bound to end, as it naturally
 did, in failure. On November 13 the American newspapers had
 to publish a joint denial sent from Budapest
 through Vienna
 by correspondents of three a encies-A.s
 g          soctated Press, United
 Press and Reuter. They stated that as proved by a check-up,
 the children's hospital remained intact and not One of the 300
 or more children in it had been injured.
 Now that the myth about "atrocities" of the Soviet Army
 has been exploded, another wild invention has been brought into
 play, that the Soviet Command is deporting from
 Hungary either
 thousands or scores of thousands of Hungarian women and
 children. This time the slanderers have again been caught red-
 handed. But what do they care! Again they are resuming their
 filthy dealings and are sure to launch tomorrow some other
 new invention.
 Why are those in charge of the reactionary propaganda cam-
 paign making such a fuss now? They have been ordered
 to smear
 the Soviet army men who responded to the appeal fo
 for help which
 came from Hungary when that country was on. the verge of
 being submerged by the fascist terror, and helped the
 Hungarian
 people to prevent the greatest catastrophe-the restoration of
 the fascist Horthyist state as a stronghold of aggression a breed-
 ing ground of war in the very centre of Europe.
 The attempts to create an atmosphere of anti-Soviet and anti-
 communist hysteria pursue the aim of making it easier for the
 forces of sinister reaction to wage the struggle against the
 demo-
 cratic forces in all countries, But no matter how hard the re-
 actionary propaganda machine may try to distort the real state
 of affairs, truth will win.

 Real Essence of Hungarian Events
 Now what has really taken place in Hungary. according to
 the information the Soviet Union possesses?
 As the facts show, the former leadership of Hungary had
 committed gross mistakes and distortions in general political
 questions and in its economic policy. These mistakes, as well as
 the economic difficulties which had arisen in Hungary during
 the reconstruction of her national economy, aroused the just
 dissatisfaction of a part of the population which demanded the
 elimination of the shortcomings and mistakes. These demands
 were supported by many Hungarian leaders.
 The actions of the masses of the people, who on October 23
 came out against the grave mistakes and distortions committed
 by the former leadership of Hungary, were absolutely lawful.
 Soon, however, reactionary fascist elements who strove to under-
 mine the people's democratic system and overthrow it, attempted
 to utilise this healthy movement for their own ends.. Already
 on October 23, when a demonstration was taking place in Buda-
 pest in which many working people inspired by good intentions
 took part, the heads of the counter-revolutionary underground
 .
 brought out into the streets armed groups they had whipped
 together in advance. They Provoked in Budapest mass disorders
 which later developed into an insurgence of the forces hostile
 to the people.
 Striving quickly to put an end to this insurgence, the Hun
 g                                                               -
 arian government asked the consent of the government of the
 U.S.S.R. for the use of Soviet military units, stationed in Hun-
 gary under the Warsaw Treaty, in helping the Hungarian authori-
 ties charged with the task of ensuring order and tranquillity in
 Budapest. A telegram received by the U.S.S.R. Council of
 Ministers from the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the
 Hungarian People's Republic on October 24, 1956, reads :
 "On behalf of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian
 People's Republic I beg the government of the Soviet Union
 to send the Soviet troops in Budapest to help to put an end
 to the disorders in Budapest, to restore order as soon as
 possible and to create conditions for peaceful creative
 labour."
 This request reflected the will of the Hungarian people for
 the early restoration of order in the country. And even Imre
 Nagy, who subsequently, conniving with the reactionary forces,
 10
 began to surrender the positions of the socialist state, said on
 October 25 that the introduction of the
 Soviet troops in the
 struggle against the counter-revolutionary forces became impera-
 tive for the sake of the vital interest of Our socialist system.
 The Soviet Union, of course could not refuse to grant the
 request of a friendly state for assistance. Several
 days later,
 however, bearing in mind that the further
 presence of Soviet
 military units in Budapest might provide
 a pretext for further
 aggravating the situation, the U.S.S.R, government with the con-
 sent of the Hungarian government ordered its forces to leave the
 Hungarian capital.
 What happened next? As soon as the Soviet troops left Buda-
 pest the reactionary forces threw off their mask and began
 massacring democratic leaders of Hungary and upright Hun-
 garian patriots. In these difficult days for Hungary the fascists
 were hanging patriots on the lamp Posts in the streets of Buda-
 pest. They broke into hospitals and shot the wounded
 . They
 smashed up factories, set light to theatres and museums. After
 the rebels had set the National Museum in Budapest alight, t
 they
 fired with sub-machine guns and machine guns
 on the fire
 brigade men and the soldiers who were trying to salvage the
 treasures in the museums. As in the cursed Hitler
 period, the
 streets of Budapest were lit up by the ill-boding fire of stakes
 on which the bodies of Hungarian patriots drenched in paraffin
 were burnt. Next, as in Hitler's days, books were burnt, the
 immortal works of progressive writers and the thinkers of man-
 kind.
 Thus, the counter-revolutionary forces who aimed at the over-
 throw of the people's democratic system in Hungary, were gradu-
 ally taking the upper hand. These forces tried to wipe out the
 achievements of the socialist revolution  they smashed up
 nationalised enterprises, state-owned shops, dislocated he means
 of transport and communications.
 The counter-revolutionary forces  which became more and
 more brazen, pushed the Imre Nagy government which had lost
 control of the situation, further and further on to the road of
 conniving with the rebels. Former Horthy and gendarmerie
 officers  became  increasingly  active. The  counter-revolution
 revealed its real face to all the people in the White terror. Well
 organised and armed counter-revolutionary gangs brutally killed
 hundreds of workers, peasants, intellectuals and progressive
 people who fell into their hands.

 I am citing only a few facts made public in such press organs
 in the capitalist countries which can hardly be suspected of
 sympathy with the communists. Thus Associated Press reported
 on October 31 that a hunt took place in the Hungarian capital
 for "members of the secret police" and that 130 secret police
 officials, taken prisoner on Tuesday, October 30, to the battle
 for the Budapest headquarters of the Communist Party, were
 hung up by their feet and beaten to death. The lie that the mem-
 bers of the Hungarian Working People's Party who fell victims
 to this monstrous lynching were "secret police officials" does not
 justify the fascist murderers. It only adds to their immoral aspect
 the feature of disgusting cowardice in face of the judgment of
 public opinion.
 The special correspondent of the West German Die Welt
 reported from Budapest that hundreds of Hungarian patriots
 were shot, hanged or drowned. He cited this fact, for instance :
 Fascist rebels, having taken prisoner 40 Hungarian patriots,
 buried them alive in an underground gallery, from where the
 knocking of the doomed people was heard for a long time.
 The organ of the West German Social Democratic Party,
 Vorwaerts, also confirmed that massacres of innocent people
 occurred in the days that counter-revolution was rampant in
 Hungary. "The terrorists," Vorwaerts emphasised, "wiped out
 not only communists, but also members of their families-
 women and children." The New York Herald-Tribune's special
 correspondent also reported from Budapest that many innocent
 people fell victim to the rebels.
 Who were the direct organisers of all these crimes? Workers?
 Peasants? Intellectuals? No, they were the former exploiting
 top leadership. The New York Times, analysing the class com-
 position of the rebels, said openly that they were the remnants
 of the overthrown classes :  rich men whom the communists
 had made poor, former landlords and wealthy peasants, repressed
 clergymen and others. The remnants of the fascist troops routed
 during the Second World War, and since entrenched in Western
 Germany, were thrown in from abroad to assist them. Thus,
 according to Italian press reports, detachments of Hungarian
 fascist emigres who formerly belonged to the Horthy army
 crossed through Austria into Hungary on the night of October
 29. They were armed with American weapons. And such men
 are now boosted as champions of freedom and democracy!
 A so-called "Hungarian committee" was set up in Vienna to
 12
 render assistance to the rebels. Otto Hapsburg,

 Political, and cultural life of society.
 The two. chambers of the Supreme Soviet of the
 U.S.S.R. the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nation-
 alities, have equal rights.
 The equality of the two Chambers is ensured by the
 fact that both are equally entitled to initiate legislation,
 and a law is considered adopted provided it is passed by
 both Chambers; the Chambers are elected for an equal
 term land appoint similar standing commissions; their
 b
 sessions begin and terminate simultaneously. In the event
 of disagreement between the Chambers, the issue is re-
 ferred for settlement to a conciliation commission formed
 on a parity basis, and if the conciliation commission fails
 to reach agreement, or if its decision fails to satisfy ei-
 ther of the Chambers, the issue is once more considered
 by both Chambers. Failing agreement, the Presidium of
 the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. dissolves the Supreme
 Soviet and decrees new elections.

 Answer. Universal suffrage means that all Soviet cit-

 tenced by court of law to penalties involving forfeiture
 of electoral rights.

 In accordance with Article 135 of the Constitution of
 the U.S.S.R. all Soviet citizens who have reached the age
 of 18, irrespective of race or

 Citizens who have reached the age of 23 are eligible
 for election to the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.
 In the conditions of the Soviet system and victorious
 socialism, universal suffrage is
 one of the most powerful
 means of drawing the masses of
 g               the people into state
 administration ensuring free expression of the people's
 will, and increasing public control over all work of the
 various state bodies.

 Question 6. Are foreign citizens residing in the Soviet
 Union entitled to vote in the election of
 deputies to the Supreme Soviet of the

 that persons residing on the Soviet territory who are not
 citizens of the U.S.S. . bu

 Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.

 bourgeois countries?

 suffrage is formally proclaimed in

 many bourgeois countries. As a matter of fact, however,
 there is not a single bourgeois country in which genuinely
 universal suffrage is ensured and in which electoral
 rights are not curtailed in one way or another. Residen-
 tial, property, educational and other qualifications bar
 numerous categories of t he population from participation
 an elections with the result that suffrage is virtually de-
 prived of its universal character. In many countries
 Iraq, Switzerland and elsewhere) women
 Iran, (Egypt,
 are denied electoral rights. In most countries men serving
 in the armed forces are disfranchised; in those cases
 where the          possess electoral rights they are, in
 they formally
 practice, unable to exercise them. In 1942, at the height
 -
 War the U.S. Senate granted serv-
 of the Second World                      5

 tions, but only                i se quartered on American territory.
 those
 Participation of the working people in elections is se-
 riously riously handicapped by the property qualification which
 exists in many countries. Another wide-spread                       a
 restriction on the suffrage is the requirement of prolonged residence in a specific locality
 prior to the compilation of lists of voters. In a number of
 states in the U.S.A.  for instance  this qualification re-
 quires that a person shall have resided in the same local-
 ity                         in Belgium for six months. In
 Y for two years,
 capitalist countries hundreds of thousands of seasonal
 workers and unemployed are affected by this qualification.
 National minorities in bourgeois countries are, as a
 rule restricted in their electoral rights or deprived of them
 altogether. Millions of people are debarred from partici-
 pation in elections on account of race or nationality. In
 the Union of South Africa most Negroes and Indians,
 who co               per cent of the population are dis-
 franchised. stitute Countries turned into colonies or dominions
 ..
 have been  laced at a disadvantage compared with the
 placed
 metropolitan  countries.  In  the  French  colonies,  for
 12
 example the entire native population, some 60 million
 people, are completely disfranchised. The vast population
 of the British colonies is in a similar position. In a num-
 ber of states in the U.S.A., Negroes cannot participate in
 elections because of an educational qualification; to ac-
 quire the right to vote, people there must be able to read,
 write and speak English. In other states of the Union
 electoral laws forbid assistance to illiterates in filling
 ballot papers, with the result that "illiterate" Negroes
 are virtually excluded from participation in elections.
 A big              ~ section of the youth in many bourgeois coun-
 tries is barred from participation in elections because of
 the high age qualification. In Britain, the U.S.A. and
 France electoral rights are not granted before the age of
 21, in Turkey 22> in Sweden 23, in Holland 25, and in
 Afghanistan 28.
 This being the case all talk about universal suffrage
 is so much deceit and hypocrisy.
 Question 8. What does equal suffrage mean?
 Answer. Equal suffrage means that at elections every
 voter is entitled to one vote equal to that of any other vot-
 er, that all citizens participate in elections on an equal
 footing and that hence no voter has special privileges.
 Under Article 122 of the Constitution of the U.S.S.R.
 women have equal rights with men in all spheres of eco-
 nomic, state cultural and socio-political activity. In ac-
 cordance with Article 136 of the Constitution elections of
 deputies are equal, which means that each citizen has
 one vote and all citizens participate in the elections on
 an equal footing. Article 137 of the Constitution specifies
 that women possess the right to elect and be elected on
 equal terms with men.
 Under Article 138 citizens serving in the Armed
 5
 Forces of the U.S.S.R. have the right to elect and be elect-
 ed to the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. on equal terms
 with all other citizens.

 Equal suffrage is proclaimed by some bourgeois con-
 stitu9tions too, but in actual practice it does not exist in
 capitalist countries.
 In recent years, knowing that elections even on mild-
 is lines would spell defeat for them, the ruling
 ly democrat                .
 circles in a number of capitalist countries have rushed
 reactionary electoral laws through the parliaments of
 Y electo
 their respective countries. In France, for instance, a new
 electoral law passed in 1951 provides that blocs of any
 parties contesting the elections shall occupy y all the seats
 .
 in Parliament from this or that department provided they
 get a simple majority, while the other parties get no
 seats, no matter how many votes they Polled. If the dem
 ocratic p                                            -
 rinciple of proportional representation were
 her parties would have a corresponding
 applied, the of
 number of seats. Small wander then that, under this elec-
 tonal "law" which has nothing in common with a genu-
 b
 inely democratic electoral sYstem the French Right-wing
 Socialists secured as many seats as the Communist Party
 of France, although they polled only half the vote record-
 ed by the Communists.
 The 1953 elections to the legislature in Italy were
 held under a new law, which the people aptly dubbed the
 "big swindle." This law established a so-called "prize
 for the majority," i.e. a rule providing roviding that the party or
 bloc of parties polling, even by one vote, more than 50 per
 cent of the votes would get 380 of the 590 seats, or 65 per
 cent of the total. Had Italian reaction succeeded in achiev-
 mg,its aim, about four million voters would, in effect,
 have been deprived of the right to send representatives to
 Parliament. The high level of political consciousness. and
 activity of the masses prevented Italian reaction from carry-
 lans into effect; it suffered a heavy defeat. Later,
 inbg its p             .
 in 1954, as a result of mass pressure the law was repealed.
 In the elections held in Western Germany in Septem-
 ber 1953   fraudulent electoral system operated whereby
 the parties polling less than five per cent of the vote and
 14
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108/11: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 not in any bloc were completely deprived of representa-
 tion in the Bundestag. As a result of this machination the.
 German Communist Party was denied representation in
 the Bundestag, although it polled more than 600,000 votes
 which entitled it to at least 12 seats. On the other hand,
 the reactionary catholic "Centre Party" which was in a
 bloc with Adenauer's party, polled only one-third of the
 Communist Party vote and yet was allocated four seats.
 It is worth taking a look at the candidates of the Ade-
 nauer bloc in these elections. Along with tycoons of West
 German capitalism and banking like the "cement" king
 D ckerhoff Schacht Henle  Pferdmen ges, and others,
 there were airforce general Stumpf, a war criminal, Hit-
 ler generals and admirals Manteuffel; HeYe, and Field
 Marshal Kesselring. Side by side with them on oandi-
 dates' lists were such out-and-out Hitlerites as von Dern-
 berg, former departmental head in Ribbentrop's ministry,
 Schmidt Hitler's personal interpreter, and Meinberg, so-
 called "Fu "hrei of the Reich Peasants."
 Such electoral laws are obviously unjust; they are
 aimed against the working masses and serve the inter-
 ests of the ruling reactionary classes in the capitalist
 countries.
 Genuine equality of electoral rights for citizens is
 fully ensured in the Soviet socialist state.
 This equality also finds expression in the procedure
 for forming the Supreme Soviet election districts.
 b
 Election districts or constituencies have been formed
 for the Soviet of the Union each district comprising
 300,000 people. Under the Soviet electoral law all the So
 viet of the Union election districts are equal, each elect-
 ing only one deputy.
 Equal suffrage in electing deputies to. the Soviet of
 Nationalities is guaranteed by the fact that the Union
 Republics elect 25 deputies each the Autonomous Re-
 Publics 11, the Autonomous Regions 5 and the National
 Areas one deputy each.
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 In conformity      this the territory of each Union
 with
 Republic is divided into twenty-five districts equal in pop-
 ulation; the territory of each Autonomous Republic, into
 eleven districts, also equal in population> and the territory
 earna,,~l  Autonomous Region, into five equal districts;
 of c
 each National Area constitutes one election district re-
 .
 Soviet of Nationalities elec-
 tion ardless districts, too elect one deputy each.
 The system of elections to the Soviet of Nationalities established by the
 Constitution and the Election Regu-
 lations is full            with the great principles of the
 fully in keeping
 Lenin -Stalin national policy which has ensured power-
 ful economic, political, and cultural progress for all
 the numerous nationalities of the U.S.S.R., united in a
 s
 single multi national  socialist state of workers and
 peasants. In some capitalist                    ,.
 countries unequal election districts are formed, with the result that in political terms the spe-
 cific weight of the voter in one constituency often turns out to be
 less than that of a voter in another constituency.
 In Britain the inequality of constituencies was also
 retained at the 1950 elections. The electorate in the
 .
 Sutherland constituency, for instance, nt mbered 25.887,
 while the LeYton and Dartmouth constituencies num-
 bered 78,491 and 79,085 respectively. This system gives
 preponderance to backward rural districts at the expense
 of the more progressive industrial centres.
 In capitalist countries the democratic principle of
 equal suffrage is grossly violated by the requirement that
 a deposit be advanced for each. candidate, which is ex-
 tremely embarrassing to the needy voters. Such an elec
 toral system is clearly incompatible with the interests of
 the vast democratic sections of the population.
 As for the Soviet electoral system, it guarantees vot-
 ers real equality and genuinely equal suffrage.
 In the U.S.S.R. the voters enjoy equal rights irrespec-
 tive of soda    ~ 1 origin, property status or occupation. Work-
 16
 ers, peasants ia.nd intellectuals participate in elections on
 an equal footing.

 elected delegates to the district congresses of Soviets. These congresses elected delegates to the regional, terri

 which in their turn elected

 tween town and country; the cultural level of the popula-
 tion and the degree of activity of the masses. It is well
 known that during the Civil War and for a number of
 years afterwards the economic, cultural and socio-politi-
 cal situation in the country made it difficult to replace
 indirect elections by direct elections.
 Speaking about the advantages of introducing direct
 elections, Comrade Molotov said:
 Direct elections will further enhance the prestige of
 the organs of Soviet power and reinforce the ties between
 these organs and the broad masses of the working people.
 The workers and peasants will have a better knowledge
 of their representatives not only in the districts and re
 gions, but in the central organs of the Soviet state; they
 will be linked more directly with them sand, gas a result,
 the entire work of the leading organs of Soviet power will
 be further improved.*
 Question 10. What is implied by the secret ballot?
 Answer. The secret ballot, established by Article 140
 of the Constitution, is a procedure in which balloting is
 not done, for instance, by show of hands in the presence
 of other voters, as is the case with the open ballot, but by
 filling ballot papers in a booth where the presence of oth-
 ers, including members of the ward election commission,
 is forbidden. This  p                a
 rocedure guarantees the electorate
 complete freedom of expression of will. In these condi-
 tions the voter feels perfectly independent, since no one
 knows, or can know, for whom he casts his vote.
 On the other hand, the secret ballot, being a power-
 Jul means of control on the part of the electorate, makes
 the deputy have more respect for public opinion, work
 better, and attend still more conscientiously to his busi-
 ness, to his duties in relation to the state.

 ordsng to press reports, for the purpose of ensuring the
 success of the elections to say nothing of the numerous
 terrorist fascist gangs hired for the same purpose.
 The replacement of the open ballot by the secret bal-
 lot lot YsvidlY illustrated, as V. M Molotov pointed out, the
 desire of the Soviet authorities to place the work of their
 organs under increased supervision by the workers and peasants. The Electron Regulations set forth rules the observ-

 Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. In towns the registers are
 compiled by the Executive Committees of urban Soviets
 of Working People's Deputies, in cities divided into dis-
 tricts, by the Executive. Committees of the district Soviets,
 in smaller towns by the Executive Committees of the
 town Soviets, and in rural localities,. by the Executive
 Committees of rural (stanitsa, village, hamlet, kishlak,
 aul) Soviets of Working People's Deputies.
 Question 12. Who are entered in the voters' register?
 Answer. Since elections to the Supreme Soviet of the
 U.S.S.R. are held on the basis of universal suffrage, the
 b
 voters' lists include all citizens who have reached the age
 of 18 by election day, who enjoy electoral rights and re-
 side (permanently or temporarily) in the territory of the
 given Soviet at the time of compilation of the lists.
 With regard to electors who have reached the age of
 18 by election day, it is required that the year, month and
 date of birth be registered in the list of voters. If the So-
 viet of Working People's Deputies lacks exact informa-
 tion concerning the month and date of birth of such an
 elector, it is assumed that he was born on January 1 of
 the year in question.
 Persons deprived of electoral rights by court of law
 b
 are not entered in the lists of voters for the period of depri-
 vation of electoral rights specified in the sentence; nor
 shall the voters' lists include persons certified insane in
 the manner prescribed by law.
 Question 13. What identification papers are required
 for the citizens to be included in the vot-
 ers' register
 ~     by the. Executive Commit-
 tees of Soviets?
 Answer. The Executive Committees of Soviets may
 not demand from citizens any papers for the purpose of
 putting their names on the voters' register. It is the duty
 of the Executive Committees themselves to compile these
 20
 registers. In towns, for instance, lists of voters are com-
 piled b     in conformity with the records in house-registers,
 and in rural localities in conformity with farmstead reg
 isters, or with the lists of temporary residents.
 Question 14. What guides the Executive Committees
 of Soviets of Working People's Depu-
 ties in deciding that persons deprived
 of electoral rights, or certified insane,
 shall not be entered in the lists of
 voters:
 Answer.    Regarding persons deprived of electoral rights b          law, the Executive Committees of So-
 shall be court of guided by absolutely reliable and carefully
 viets  by
 checked evidence, such as copy of the sentence or an of-
 ficial announcement by organs of the Procurator's Office
 or courts of law. Statements in this respect by private in-
 dividuals are not sufficient in themselves.
 In retg ~ard to insane persons the Executive Committees
 shall be guided either by the certificate issued by court of
 ~
 lave on the basis of an ,act by judicial and psychiatric
 of medical establish-
 experts or by official notifications
 menu (asylums,                                                                                                  ecia1 medical commissions), acting on

 special powers vested in them by the law.
 Question 15. Should citizens sentenced by court of
 law to a penalty that does not involve
 either imprisonment or deprivation of
 electoral rights be included in lists of
 voters?
 Answer. Such citizens are included in lists of voters.
 The lists should not include citizens convicted by court
 without deprivation of electoral rights if they are under arrest since in such circumstances they are unable to
 participate in elections.
 Besides, voters' lists do not include persons under
 judicial examination and therefore held under arrest.

 Question 16. How and where are nomads (e.g., Gip-
 sies  included in voters' lists?
 Answer. They are included in voters' lists on an equal
 footing with all other citizens by the Executive Committees
 b
 of the Soviets of Working People's Deputies in whose ter-
 ritory they are camped at the time of compilation of the
 lists.
 Question 17. Can a citizen be entered in more than
 one voters' register?
 Answer. No. The Election Regulations (Article 13)
 establish that no voter can be entered in more than one
 list of voters, otherwise the principle of equal suffrage
 would be violated.
 Question 18. How are voters' lists compiled in mili-
 tary units or military formations? In
 what voters' lists are all the other per-
 sons on military service included?
 Answer. Lists of voters in military units and military
 formations are drawn up by the command and signed by
 the commander.
 All other persons on military service are entered in
 voters' lists according to place of residence by the Exec-
 utive Committees of the appropriate local Soviets, and
 they vote, too, according to place of residence.
 in military units and
 Question 19. Do persons serving         ~
 military formations of the Soviet Army
 and NavY beyond the Soviet frontiers
 participate in elections to the Supreme
 Soviet of the U.S.S.R.?
 Answer. Yes, they do. BY a decree dated October 14,
 1945, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.
 settled this matter guided by Article 138 of the Constitu-
 tion which establishes that citizens serving in the Soviet
 Army have the right to elect and be elected on equal terms

 Soviet citizens. They vote in special election
 with . all other districts. The rate. of representation for the troops is one
 deputy in each of the two Chambers of the Supreme So-
 viet of the U.S.S.R., the Soviet of the Union and the So-
 viet of Nationalities for each special district.
 Question 20. What facilities are at the disposal of
 electors  for  inspecting  voters'  reg-
 isters?
 Answer. The Regulations bind the Executive Com-
 mittees of Soviets of Working People's Deputies to exhib-
 it voters' lists for public inspection thirty days prior to
 electrons or to enable electors to acquaint themselves
 with the lists on the premises either of the Soviet or the
 election ward.
 Question 21. What is the significance of providing
 citizens with facilities for prior inspec-
 tion of the voters' lists?
 Answer. Prior examination of voters' lists is of great
 importance since it makes it possible timely detection and
 correction of errors (non-inclusion in the list of citizens
 possessing electoral rights, inclusion of persons deprived
 of electoral rights, distortion of surname, given name or
 patronymic, etc.).
 Question 22. What is the procedure for correcting
 voters' lists?
 Answer. To have any inaccuracy in the lists correct-
 ed-inaccuracies such as non-inclusion or exclusion from
 patronym-
 the lists,                             Mme or distortion of surname, given n me
 ic, incorrect inclusion of persons deprived of electoral
 rights etc. the citizen must submit an appropriate appli-
 cation to the Executive Committee of the Soviet of Work-
 ing People's Deputies which published the list. It is the
 the matter within three
 duty of that body to consider
 days.
 23
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 Any citizen may submit such a claim to the Executive
 Committee of a Soviet either directly or through the ward
 election commission.
 Question 23. Is it permissible to ~appeal against ~a de-
 cision taken by the Executive Committee
 of the Soviet concerning corrections in
 voters' lists?
 Answer. Yes, appeal can be made. To do this the citi-
 zen must submit his complaint to a People's Court. The
 court is obliged to examine the complaint in open session
 within three days in the presence of the claimant and a
 representative of the Executive Committee of the Soviet
 in question and immediately announce its decision both
 to the Executive Committee of the Soviet and to the claim-
 ant.
 The decision of a People's Court is final and is not
 subject to appeal.
 The foregoing shows that the procedure of compiling
 voters' lists in the Soviet Union is simple s      e and democrat-
 ic in the highest degr:ee and fully guarantees the cor-
 rection of possible mistakes.
 Question 24. How do voter
 s who have changed their
 place of residence after publication of
 voters' lists participate in elections?
 Answer. A voter who has changed his place  of
 residence in the interval, between the date of publication
 of voters' lists and election day, can be included in the
 register at his new Place of residence.
 For this he must obtain from the Executive Committee
 of the appropriate Soviet of Working People's Deputies
 the "Voting Right Certificate" established by the Presid-
 ium of the 'Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. He then
 submits this certificate together with his identification
 papers, to the Executive Committee of the Soviet at his
 new  place of  residence-permanent  or  temporary-
 24
 25
 whereupon he is entered in the voters' list and so partic-
 ipates in ti e elections in the ordinary way.
 Question 25. What is the voting procedure for elec-
 tors who arrive at a new place of resi-
 dence on polling day.
 Answer. An elector who arrives at a new place of
 residence on polling day may go to any election ward
 where> upon presentation of the "Voting ? Right Certifi-
 cate" and identification papers, he will be entered in the
 voters' list, receive ballot papers and vote on equal foot-
 ing with the other electors.

 OF NATIONALITIES
 ELECTION DISTRICTS
 Question 26. On what  principle  are the  election
 districts for the Soviet of the Union
 formed?
 Answer. The election districts for the Soviet of the
 Union are formed on the following principle: the entire
 territory of the U.S.S.R. is divided into election districts
 of 300,000 inhabitants per district.
 Hence there are as many election districts in the
 U.S.S.R. as obtain from division of the total population
 by 300,000. For the 1954 elections to the Soviet of the
 Union there were 700 election districts.
 Question 27. How are the election districts for the
 Soviet of Nationalities formed?
 Answer. Twenty-five  election  districts  have  been
 formed in each Union Republic. Since there are sixteen
 Union Republics in the U.S.S.R. 400 districts were formed

 for the 1954 elections. There are 11 districts in each
 Autonomous Re ublic  a total of 176 for the 16 Auton-
 omous Republics. PThe nine Autonomous Regions have five election districts each or 45 altogether. The ten Na-
 tionial Areas have one election district each. The total
 number of the Soviet of Nationalities election districts
 in 1954 was 631.
 In all, 1,331 election districts were formed for the 1954
 elections to the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet, not counting
 the special election districts formed in military units and military formations of the Soviet Army and Navy beyond
 Soviet territory.
 Question 28. How many deprties are elected to the
 Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.?
 Answer. Since each election district elects but cne
 deputy, the total number of the Supreme Soviet deputies
 is 1,331, besides a certain number is elected by voters

 Chapter IV
 ELECTION WARDS
 Question 29. Whist is 1., the election ward and for what
 purpose is it set up?
 Answer. The election ward is formed for the purpose
 of polling ballots and counting the votes. To this end
 P
 ever           district forming ? part of an election dis-
 trict every
 or city and constituency is divided into wards common for
 elections to the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of
 Nationalities.

 holding of elections in the district much
 deuce, makes the easier.
 If the voters of a whole district had to vote in one
 both             the counting of votes would be
 place,     polling and            b
 exceedingly difficult and would require much more time,
 .
 whereas, according to the Regul;ations> elections to the
 Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. must be held in the course
 of one day.
 Plainly it is much more convenient and rational to
 poll ballots and count the votes according to small wards
 rather than in one large election district.
 Question 30. Who is empowered by law to set up
 election wards?
 Answer. In cities divided into districts the duty of
 setting up election wards is assigned to the Executive
 u
 Committees of the district Soviets of Working People's
 Deputies, and in towns with no such division, to the
 Executive Committees of the town Soviets, ? in rural local-
 Mies the task falls to the Executive Committees of the
 People's Deputies.

 Y
 Question 31. On what  principle are the  election
 wards formed?
 Answer. In towns, industrial centres  villages and
 rural localities with more than 2,000 inhabitants, election
 wards are formed so that each ward comprises from
 1,500 to 3,000 inhabitants.
 As a rule, the territory of a rural Soviet with not
 more than 2,000 inhabitants ? constitutes a single election
 ward- each stanitsa, village, kishlak and aul with 500
 or more inhabitants, but not in excess of 2>000, consti-
 tutes a separate election ward.
 In villages or groups of villages with about 500 in-
 habitants but not less than 300, separate election wards
 from these villages to the
 may be set up, if the distance                b
 u
 election ward centre exceeds ten kilometres.
 CIA-RDP81 -01 043R0007001 00003-6
 In remote northern and eastern regions, where small
 communities prevail, it is permissible to form election
 wards of not less than 100 inhabitants.
 As for the National Areas in the North as well as in
 mountainous and nomadic regions, the Election Regula-
 tions permit the forming of election wards there, even
 if the population is below 100, provided, however, that
 it is not below 50.
 Military units and military formations  constitute
 separate ejection wards of not less than 50 and not more
 than 3,000 voters.
 Question 32. What facilities are there for voters in
 hospitals, maternity homes, sanatoria
 and invalid homes to participate in
 elections?
 Answer. In all medical establishments and invalid
 homes too, with not less than 50 electors, separate elec-
 tion wards are formed. In hospitals of several buildings
 election wards may be set up in each building, provided
 it houses not less than 50 voters.
 As regards voters who, while not in hospitals, are
 unable to reach the election ward because of illness, it
 is the duty of the members of the ward commission or of
 specially authorized persons to visit the voter's home
 upon request where the ballot paper is filled in and
 placed in a miniature ballot box.
 Question 33. How do voters on board ship on election
 day participate in elections?
 Answer. Vessels under sail on election day, and with
 not less than 25 voters on board, may constitute separate
 election wards, to be included in the election district of
 the port of registry.
 Question 34. What about citizens travelling in iong-
 distance trains on election day, how do
 they Participate in elections?
 28
 Answer. In long-distance trains that are under way
 on election day, wards are arrange
 d so that voters hold-
 ing "Voting Right Certificates" can
 g                          poll their ballot
 papers. Train election wards are registered either in the
 districts where the respective trains were marshalled, or
 in the districts whose territory they cross on election day.
 In the light of the foregoing it i
 is clear that the Soviet
 principle of forming election wards ensures maximum
 attendance by voters and by removing every hindrance
 and difficulty in the way the elect
 Y          - or exercises his rights,
 makes the voting for the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.
 genuinely universal. Every point in the Election Regula-
 tions reflects the broad popular
 democratism of the
 Soviet electoral
 system. Small wonder, therefore that as
 a rule the overwhelming majority of +
 g   ~   y   the electorate goes
 to the polls in the Soviet Union.

 Chapter VI
 PROCEDURE FOR NOMINATING CANDIDATES
 TO THE SUPREME SOVIET
 OF THE U.S.S.R.
 Question 44. How are candidates to the  Supreme
 Soviet of the U.S.S.R. nominated?
 Answer. In accordance with Article 141 of the Consti-
 tution of the U.S.S.R. the Election Regulations establish
 that the right to nominate candidates to the Supreme
 Soviet of the U.S.S.R. is ensured to public organizations
 and societies of the working people, namely, Communist
 Party organizations, trade unions co-operatives, youth
 organizations, and cultural societies.
 33
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 The right to nominate candidates is exercised by the
 central bodies of public organizations and societies of the
 working people and by their rePublican  territorial,
 b regional, uyezd and district bodies as well as by general meetings of workers and other employees in enterprises,
 and of servicemen in army and naval units, and also by
 general meetings of peasants on collective farms, and of
 state farm workers and other employees on state farms.
 In conformity with Article 126 of the Constitution, all
 citizens of the U.S.S.R. may, regardless of occupation,
 unite in various public organizations: trade unions, co-
 operative associations, youth and sports organizations,
 cultural, technical and scientific societies, ; and the most
 active and politically-conscious citizens in the ranks of
 the working class and other sections of the working
 may unite in the Communist Party of the Soviet
 people
 Union, which is the vanguard of the working people in
 their struggle for building communist society, and the leading core of all organizations of the working people,
 both public and state. It is
 clear that this procedure which provides Soviet
 citizens with the greatest opportunity of participating in
 the nomination of candidates to the Supreme Soviet of
 the U.S.S.R. is genuinely democratic.
 Question 45. Who may be nominated as candidate to
 the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.?
 Answer. Under the Soviet electoral law any citizen
 'who. has reached the age of twenty-three and enjoys
 electoral rig        b hts is eligible for election to the Supreme
 Soviet of the U.S.S.R.
 This la` ~v does not make any special claims on candi-
 dates to the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.
 The situation is quite different in bourgeois countries.
 In Britain, for example each candidate must deposit
 150. pounds, in Canada 300 dollars and in Japan 2,000
 yen. Moreover, in the event of the candidate not polling
 34
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108/11: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 a definite minimum of votes, this .deposit is confiscated
 for the benefit of the state. In some countries candidates
 meet the expenditure in acquiring ballot papers.
 Nothing like this exists in the Soviet Union where
 there are no "election deposits" or payment of election
 expenditure by candidates.
 According
 According to Article 11 of the Election Regulations
 all the expenditure incurred in elections to the Supreme
 Soviet of the U.S.S.R. is borne by the state.
 Candidates to the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.
 are nominated by the people themselves, who proceed
 solely from the personal ability of the citizens concerned,
 from the quality of their work, sand from their devo-
 tion to the people and country.
 Question 46. How are the candidates to the Supreme
 Soviet of the U.S.S.R, nominated and
 registered?
 Answer. According to the Election Regulations public
 organizations or societies of the working people nominat-
 ing candidates for the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.
 must submit to the district election commissions the
 following documents indicated in Article 61 of the Elec
 tion Regulations: first, the minutes of the meeting at
 which the candidate was nominated; second, a declara-
 tion by the candidate of his consent to stand for election
 in the given election district on behalf of the organiza-
 tion which nominated him.
 The minutes must state the surname, given name and
 patronymic of the candidate his age- address, part
 Y
 affiliation and occupation. Besides, they must state the
 time and place of the meeting and the number of persons
 present;
 The minutes must be signed by the members of the
 presidium of the meeting, and stating their addresses
 and the name of the organization nominating the candi?

 district election commission is entitled to refuse regis-
 tration of the candidate. In that case the candidate is
 not included in the ballot paper.
 Question 47. Is it permissible to appeal against the
 refusal of a district election commission
 to register a candidate?
 Answer. Yes, it is. The Election Regulations point out
 that the refusal of a district Soviet of the Union election
 commission or a district Soviet of Nationalities election
 commission to register a candidate may be appealed
 against within a period of two days.
 Question 48. With what body is the refusal of a
 district election commission to register
 a candidate for the U.S.S.R. Supreme
 Soviet appealed against?
 Answer. Appeal against refusal of a district Soviet
 of the Union election commission to register a candidate
 is lodged with the Central Election Commission.
 Appeal against refusal of a district Soviet of Nation-
 36
 election commission to register a candidate is
 Titles

 The decision of the Central Election Commission is
 final and is not subject of subject to appeal.
 Question 49. Is it permissible to nominate one can-
 didate in several districts?
 Answer. Yes, this can be done. No matter where a
 candidate lives and regardless of whether he has already
 been nominated in one district, he may be nominated by
 electors in any other district. But the Election Regula-
 tions provide that a'candidate for the Supreme Soviet
 of the U.S.S.R. may stand for election only in one dis-

 district Soviet of the 'Union election commissions and
 the district Soviet of Nationalities election commissions

 Chapter YII
 VOTING PROCEDURE
 Question 52. Are elections to the Supreme Soviet of
 the U.S.S.R. held on one day or are
 they spread over a number of days?
 Answer. The Election Regulations provide that elec-
 tions to the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. shall be
 held in the course of one day, which shall be the same
 throughout the U.S.S.R. The elections are held on a
 Sunday, otherwise part of the electorate would be unable
 to participate in voting.
 In some bourgeois countries, on the contrary, elec-
 tions are held on week days, with a view to preventing
 working people from participating in elections..
 Question 53. Where does polling take place?
 Answer. Polling takes place on premises specially
 set aside for the purpose. Every day, fora period of
 twenty days prior to the elections, the ward election
 commissions publish, or otherwise make generally known
 38
 to the electors the place of voting as well as the date of
 the elections.
 Question 54. What are the polling hours?
 Answer. Polling  takes  place  from  6  a.m.  until
 midnight local time. At 6 a.m. on election day the chair-
 man of each ward election commission examines the
 ballot boxes in the presence of the members of the corn
 mission and ascertains that there is a list of voters corn-
 piled in the prescribed form whereupon he seals the
 boxes with the seal of the commission and invites the
 electors to vote.
 At midnight on election day, the chairman of the
 ward election commission declares polling terminated,
 and the commission proceeds to open the ballot boxes
 and count the votes.
 Question 55. How does polling take place?
 Answer. Every elector votes personally at the polling
 station. There he presents to the secretary y or any other
 authorized member of the ward election commission his
 PassPort or collective-farm or trade-union membership
 card or some other evidence of identity. After his name
 is checked in the voters' list and an entry ? made in the
 list recording the issue of ballot papers, he is given
 ballot papers of the prescribed form.
 He then proceeds to a special room, a booth, to fill in
 the ballots. There in the absence of members of the ward
 election commission or any other persons, he leaves the
 name .of the candidate he votes for and crosses out ,the
 names of the others. Thence he proceeds to the room
 where the wand election commission is located and drops
 his ballot papers into the ballot box.
 Question 56. Can a number of electors be simul-
 taneously admitted to the room set
 aside for filling in the ballot papers?
 39
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108/11: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 Answer. Yes. In this case to ensure the secrecy of
 balloting, the law requires that the room set aside for
 filling ballot papers be fitted with partitions or screens
 and divided into booths according to the number of vot-
 ers admitted simultaneously, so that one elector may not
 see what is done by the other.
 Question 57. How do illiterates vote?
 Answer. The  law  provides  illiterates  with  every
 opportunity to participate in voting. An illiterate voter
 is entitled to invite any other voter to enter the room set
 aside for filling ballot papers and help him to fill his
 ballot papers.
 Question 58. What is the method of voting for in-
 valids or persons unable owing to phys-
 ical disability to fill the ballot papers
 themselves?
 or y of voters, as is the case
 Answer. For this category
 with illiterates the law provides the necessary voting
 conditions by permitting ermitting them to invite any other voter
 into the room assigned for filling ballot papers so as to
 o
 fill their ballot papers with that person's help.
 Question 59. Is electioneering work permitted during
 the hours of voting?
 Answer. The Election Regulations say that every
 organization nominating a candidate registered with a
 district election commission, in the same way as every
 citizen of the U.S.S.R., is ensured the right freely to can-
 vass in favour of that candidate at meetings, through
 the press and in other ways.
 Electioneering is forbidden only at the polling sta-
 tions on polling day. This is done so that no one shall
 exercise any influence on electors  at the time of
 voting.

 COUNTING THE VOTES
 Question 60. How does the ward election commis-
 sions conduct the count?
 Answer. The Election Regulations contain the follow-
 ing rules: at midnight local time on election day, the
 chairman of the ward election  commission  declares
 polling terminated, and the commission proceeds to open
 the ballot boxes. The right to attend the counting of
 votes on the premises of the election ward is extended
 to representatives of public organizations and societies
 of the working people, specially authorized for the pur-
 pose, and to representatives of the press. Having opened
 the ballot boxes, the ward election commission checks
 the number of ballots cast with the number of persons
 who received them and enters the result in an official
 record. When the ballot papers have been checked, the
 chairman announces in the presence of all the members
 of the commission the results of the vote cast by each
 ballot paper. The votes cast are counted separately for
 the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities.
 When the counting of the votes cast for each candi-
 date is completed, the commission draws up official
 records in the prescribed form and announces the results
 in the presence of all its members i.e. informs them of
 the total number of votes cast for each candidate.
 These official records are signed by all the members
 of the ward election commission, the signatures of the
 b
 chairman and the secretary being indispensable.
 Question 61. Can a ward election commission declare
 ballot papers invalid?.
 Answer. Yes it can do so if the ballot papers contain
 the names of more candidates than the number of depu-
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 ties to be elected and also if the papers are not printed
 in the prescribed form.
 Question 62. Why are such ballot papers declared
 invalid?
 Answer. If a ballot paper contains the names of
 several candidates and a voter leaves the names of, say,
 two of them, it will not be clear to the election commis-
 sion which of the two candidates the voter wants to
 elect. Such a ballot paper will be declared invalid. Every
 ,
 voter must therefore choose one candidate from those
 whose names are entered in the ballot paper, i.e., leave
 that candidate's name, striking out the other names.
 only                             b
 Ballot papers not made out in the prescribed form
 are declared invalid for the simple reason that the poll-
 ing of such ballot papers may entail various abuses,
 a
 and also because the secrecy of the ballot may be vio-
 lated; such papers make it possible to reveal the identity
 of the voter and by the same token to establish for whom
 the elector in question voted. Hence, the Central Election
 Commission prescribes a definite form of ballot paper,
 and the. Election Regulations establish that ballot pa-
 pers ers in any T other form are null and void.
 Question 63. How do the district election commis-
 sions conduct the count?
 Answer. The district election  commissions conduct
 the count on the basis of the official records submitted
 by the ward election commissions and then determine the
 number of votes cast in the election district for each
 candidate. The official records of the vote, drawn up by
 .
 the district election commission, are signed b : all its
 members, the signatures of its chairman and secretary
 being indispensable.
 Question 64. What does the official record of the
 district election commission indicate?

 The official records of the ward election commissions
 are transmitted to the respective district election commis-
 sions; the official records of the district Soviet of the
 Union election commissions are sent to the Central
 Election Commission while
 the records of the district
 Soviet of Nationalities election commissions are sent to
 the respective Soviet of
 Nationalities eleotion commis-
 sion of the Union or Autonomous Republic Autonomous
 Region or National Area.
 This enables the higher-level
 election commissions to check the work of the ward and
 district commissions.
 Question 66. Which candidate for the Supreme So-
 viet  of                                         the  U.S.S.R.  i
 is  considern
 ~~,d
 elected?
 Answer. The candidate for the Supreme Soviet of
 the U.S.S.R. is considered
 l elected provided he has polled
 an absolute majority of the votes, or more than half the
 total number of the valid
 votes cast in tha district.
 Question 67. Is the candidate who  oils an absolute
 majority of the votes regarded as being
 elected in any case?
 Answer. No. Should the number of votes cast in a
 district be less than half the number of the electors en-
 titled to vote in the given district, the election will be de-
 cliared void. Hence
 a candidate polling an
 absolute
 majority of the votes in
 Y               such an election is not regarded
 as being elected since the number of votes cast is less
 than half the number of the electors
 in the given election
 .
 district.
 In some countries
 elections are deemed valid even if
 i~
 only 30 per cent of t
 Y   p          he electorate goes to the poll. Accord-
 ing, to Soviet law this is impermissible and such prac
 tices are out of the question.
 Question 68. Does the Soviet electoral  law permit
 re-balloting of candidates?
 it  does. Re-balloting is conducted if
 Answer. Yes,                                             b
 none of the candidates in the given election district polls
 an absolute majority of votes, i.e., if each receives less
 than half the number of the votes cast.
 When this occurs> a re-balloting is ordered not of all
 the candidates contesting the district but of the two can-
 didat?.s who received the largest number of votes.
 Question 69. Who orders the re-balloting and what
 is the time-limit for it?
 Answer. Re-balloting          by is ordered b y the district Soviet
 of the Union election commission, or by the district
 Soviet of Nationalities election commission, as the case
 may be, and takes place not later than two weeks after
 the date of the first ballot.
 Question 70. What is to be done if the number of
 votes cast is less than half the number
 of the electors in the given election
 district?
 Answer. If in any district the number of votes cast is
 less than half the number of electors entitled to vote in
 that district, new elections are ordered. In this case the
 district election commission makes a note to that effect
 in the official record and immediately informs the Central
 Election Commission and the Soviet of Nationalities
 election  commission  of  the  Union  or  Autonomous
 Republic, Autonomous Region or National Area.
 The Central Election Commission orders new elec-
 tions to be held not later than two weeks after the date
 of    first elections.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 Answer. In this case the Presidium of the Supreme
 Soviet of the U.S.S.R. appoints a date for the election of
 a new deputy for the district concerned, to be held not
 later than two months after the seat in the Supreme
 Soviet falls vacant.
 Re-balloting
 or new elections are conducted on the
 basis of rile lists of voters drawn up for the first elections.
 Question 72. In what way are electoral rights pro-
 tected by law?
 Answer. The Election  egul'ations contain two arts
 cles which stipulate that anyone who seeks to prevent
 Soviet citizens from exercising their electoral rights
 shall be severely punished.
 Article 109 of the Election
 Regulations reads as
 follows: "Any person who by i violence, fraud, intimidation
 or bribery hinders a citizen
 Y                    of the U.S.S.R, in the
 exercise of h.is right to elect and be elected to the Supremo
 ~r
 Soviet of the U.S.S.R. shall be liable to a a term ~e~,~l of im
 m -
 prisonment of un to two years."
 1
 And Article 110 of the Election negulat.olls says:
 "Any
 official of a Soviet or
 member of an election tom-
 mission guii                               ui fa1sif}ling y            o election documents, or of
 deliberately falsifying in~- the count shall be liable to a ter;T,
 ...
 of imprisonment of up to three -     "
 p         years.
 Such is the content of the "Regulations Governing
 Elections to the Supreme Soviet o      T      "
 of the t~.S.S.k.       which
 guarantee the genuinely universal character of elections.
 The Election Regulations
 provide all the necessary con-
 ditions for holding elections to the supreme legislative
 .
 body of the U.S.S.R. strictly in keeping with the great
 of the Constitution of
 principles                         the land of Soviets,
 which, under the leadership of the Communist p     e   ~~~munist Party, is
 stepping out confidently towards communism.

 CHAPTER  ONE
 INTRODUCTION
 C?          ! I MUST APOLOGISE,  It is quite some
 time since you asked me to give you a ta.k but I
 have had to delay coming until today. The question I am
 going to talk about is the cultivation of Communist Party
 members.  I think that it may no
 y not be unprofitable for
 us to talk about this question at a time when we are
 facing the basic task of building and consolidating the
 Party.  I want to divide my talk into several parts  so
 today I shall deal with
 one part only, leaving the rest
 for next time.  In order to enable many of the younger
 comrades to understand, I shall have to give
 more ex-
 planations and examples on certain
 questions..  Conse-
 quently, I cannot make my talk very succinct.                                                                                                                        This I
 must make clear at the very beginning,
 Why Must Communist Party Members
 Undertake Self-cultivation?
 Comrades, wh   must Communist Party members
 undertake self -cultivation?

 Ever since man came into the world, in order to be
 able to live, he has had to struggle against nature to
 produce the material values essential to his existence.
 However,
 men carry on a struggle against nature and utilise nature
 for the production of material values not in isolation from
 each other, not as separate individuals, but in common, in
 groups, in societies.  Production, therefore, is at all times
 and under all conditions social production.  In the produc-
 tion of material values men enter into mutual relations of
 one kind or another within production, into relations of
 production of one kind or another.  (The History of the
 Communist Party of the Soviet Union (B) Short Course,
 English edition, 1951, pp. 188-189)
 Thus, the struggle carried on by men against nature
 for production is social in character.      It is a struggle of
 men_ as social beings against nature.       It is in this cease-
 less struggle against nature that human beings have
 been continuously changing nature and simultaneously
 themselves and have changed their relations with one
 another.  It is in the course of the long struggle of men
 as social beings against nature, that men's physical forms
 (hands, feet, posture, etc.), their social relations, their
 forms of social organisation  as well  as their brains,
 ideology, etc. are all continuously being changed and
 improved.  This is because:
 The first feature of production is that it never stays at
 one point for a long time and is always in a state of change
 and development, and that, furthermore, changes in the mode
 of production inevitably call forth changes in the whole
 social system,  social ideas, political views  and" political
 institutions.  (Ibid pp. 189-190)
 Man has evolved from animals.  In ancient times,
 man's mode of life social organisation and ideology, etc.
 were different from what they are today.  In the future,
 man's mode of life social organisation ideology, etc. will
 also be different from what they are today.
 Humanity itself and human society are a kind of
 process of historical evolution.  They are developing and
 changing and they can be, and have already been, con-
 tinuously changed in the course of struggle.
 When human society developed to a certain historical
 stage, class society arose.  Thereafter, men in a class
 society exist as men of a given class.  According to the
 principles  of  Marxist  philosophy,  men's social  being
 determines their ideology.   Thus in a class society men's
 ideology represents the ideology of a given social class.
 In a class society there are ceaseless class struggles. Thus,
 in the course of constant struggle against nature and
 constant struggle of social classes, men change nature,
 change society and at the same time change their own
 ideology.
 Marx once told the workers:
 You will have to go through fifteen, twenty, fifty years
 of civil wars and international conflicts, not only to change
 existing conditions, but also to change yourselves and to
 make yourselves capable of wielding political power.
 In other words men change themselves not only in
 their struggle against nature but also in constant social
 snuggle.  The proletariat will also have to consciously go
 g

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 through a long period of social struggle to change society
 and itself.
 Thus  men should regard themselves as being in
 need of and capable of, being changed.  They should not
 look upon themselves as something unchanging, perfect,
 holy and beyond reform.  It is in no way an insult but
 the inevitable law of natural and social evolution; other-
 wise men cannot make progress.
 We Communist Party members are the most advanced
 revolutionaries in modern history and are the contempor-
 ary fighting and driving force in changing society and the
 .,                      wawa                b
 world.  Revolutionaries exist because counter-revolution-
 aries still exist.  Therefore to conduct a ceaseless struggle
 against the counter-revolutionaries constitutes an essen-
 tial condition for the existence and development of the
 revolutionaries. If they fail to carry on sucI a struggle,
 they cannot be called revolutionaries and still less can
 they advance and develop.  It is in the course of this
 ceaseless strusb ggle against the counter-revolutionaries that
 Communist Party members change society, change the
 world and at the same time change themselves.
 A Communist Party member changes himself through
 his struggle against counter-revolution in various fields.
 It means that to achieve one's own progress and to raise
 one's revolutionary qualities and technique requires the
 unification of the following two aspects: one's steeling in
 the practical struggle and the cultivation of one's ideas.
 To pass from a novice to a mature and well-experienced
 revolutionary able to cope with any situation calls for a
 very long process of revolutionary steeling and cultiva-
 tion, that is, a long process of reformation.  A compara-
 tively inexperienced revolutionary is still unable to ac-
 quire a really profound understanding of the enemy, of
 himself, of the laws of social development and the laws
 of the revolution because he has grown up in the old
 society and naturally has brought with him remnants of
 various ideologies, prejudices and habits of the old society
 and because he is still inexperienced and has not yet
 undergone a long period of revolutionary practice.
 In order to change this situation, besides studying
 revolutionary experiences from history (the practice of
 our predecessors) he must himself participate in the con-
 temporary revolutionary practice.  In this revolutionary
 practice, that is, in the struggle against various counter-
 revolutionary elements, he should develop his subjective
 initiative and redouble his efforts in study and cultiva-
 tion.  Only then will he be able to gradually learn from
 his experience and to understand more profoundly the
 laws of social development and the laws of the revolu-
 tion; be able to understand the enemy and himself; be
 able to discover the incorrectness of his own former ideas,
 habits and prejudices and to correct them; be : able to
 io sness and his revolutionary
 qualities and improve his revolutionary methods, etc.
 Therefore in order to change himself and raise the level
 of his consciousness, a revolutionary should not of course
 isolate himself from revolutionary practice, or abandon
 his own subjective efforts to carry on self-cultivation and
 to learn through practice (both his own practice and that
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108/11: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 This is because these Party members possessed dif-
 ferent revolutionary qualities, because they developed in
 different directions in revolutionary practice and because
 they differed in their subjective efforts in revolutionary
 practice, and in their degree and methods of self-cultiva-
 tion.  Because of the different qualities possessed by
 revolutionaries and the variation in their subjective efforts
 and self-cultivation, it is possible that in the same revolu-
 tionary  practice,  entirely  different  or  even  opposite
 results and influences may ensue. Such cases can be
 found even in your school. In the school you all receive
 the same kind of education and training. However,
 because of your different qualities, experiences, cultural
 levels, subjective efforts and the degree and methods of
 self-cultivation  You may get different or even opposite
 results.  Have you not noticed that a small number of
 people have moved further away from the revolution after
 receiving education and training in schools in Yenan?
 This is due to the same cause.  Hence, for a revolutionary
 to change and improve himself, subjective effort, self-
 cultivation and learning in the course of the revolutionary
 struggle are absolutely necessary and indispensable.
 of others).  Without the latter it will still be impossible
 for a revolutionary to improve himself.
 For example, several Communist Party members
 go
 together to take part in a certain revolutionary mass
 struggle, undergo almost the same revolutionary practice
 and yet in the end the influence exerted on these Party
 members might be entirely different.  Some may advance
 very quickly and some formerly backward members may
 even overtake others.  Some may advance very slowly.
 Others may even begin to vacillate in the course of the
 struggle,  and  the  revolutionary  practice,  instead  of
 enabling them to advance, has left them behind.       What
 is the cause of all this?
 Again for example, many of our Communist Party
 members took part in the Long March, which was a
 severe test for our Party members and which exercised
 an extremely progressive and positive influence among
 Party members and even among the broad masses of the
 people.  However, in the case of a very small number
 of Party members the influence was just the opposite.
 Having gone through the hard struggle of the Long March
 an                                           fearful of this
 and the ten years  Civil War, they grew
 hard struggle.  They attempted to retreat and run away.
 Finally, they deserted the revolutionary ranks as a result
 of outside inducement.  Many Party members took part
 in the Long March and yet the influence upon them and
 the results thus obtained were vastly different.  What is
 the cause of all this?
 Not every revolutionary who has undergone the
 steeling of long years of revolutionary struggle can
 develop into a very good and experienced revolutionary,
 chiefly because his own efforts and self-cultivation are
 insufficient.  But all those who have succeeded in be-
 coming very good and experienced revolutionaries must
 certainly have b gone through long years of steeling and
 self-cultivation in the revolutionary struggle.  Hence, our

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 Party members can make themselves politically inflexible
 revolutionaries of high         only by steeling quality                  themselves,
 strengthening their self-cultivation, not losing their sense
 of the new and by improving their reasoning power in
 the course of the revolutionary struggle of the broad
 masses under all difficulties and hardships.
 Confucius said:
 At fifteen, I had my mind bent on learning.  At thirty,
 I stood firm.  At forty, I had no doubts. At fifty, I knew
 the decree of Heaven.  At sixty, my ear was an obedient
 organ for the reception of truth.  At seventy, I could follow
 my heart's desire, without transgressing what was right.
 Here Confucius was relating the process of his
 g                    steel-
 ing and self-cultivation.                      He did not regard himself as
 a born `sage'.
 Mencius said:
 When Heaven is about to confer a great office on any
 man, it first exercises his mind with suffering, and his sinews
 and bones with toil.  It exposes his body to hunger, and
 subjects him to extreme poverty.  It confounds his under-
 takings.  By all these methods it stimulates his mind hardens
 his nature, and remedies his incompetencies.
 What Mencius said also refers to
 the process of
 steeling and self-cultivation that a great  man  must
 undergo. As  Communist  Party  members  have       to
 shoulder the unprecedented)Y 'great office' of changing
 the world it is all the more necessary for them to go
 through such steeling and self-cultivation.
 The cultivation of Communist Party members is a
 revolutionary cultivation.  We cannot carry on our cul-
 tivation  by  divorcing  ourselves  from  revolutionary
 practice or the practical revolutionary movement of the
 broad toiling masses, particularly the proletarian masses.
 The aim of our cultivation is solely to serve the interests
 of revolutionary practice and to direct more effective)
 Y
 the practical revolutionary  movement  of  the  masses.
 Herein lies the difference between our cultivation and
 other idealistic, formal and abstract cultivations which
 are divorced from social practice.  I shall make a further
 brief
 explanation on this point later on.
 Our Party members should steel themselves and
 intensify their self-cultivation not only in the course of
 arduous, difficult and  even unsuccessful revolutionary
 practice but also in the course of favourable  successful
 and victorious revolutionary practice.  Some Party mem-
 bers cannot keep their balance when they are heartened
 by success and victory and become dizzy with victories.
 Victory, success, the tribute paid them by the broad
 masses of the people as well as a certain amount of
 prestige which they enjoy among the masses make them
 unscrupulous, arrogant, bureaucratic or even vacillating,
 corrupt  and degenerate,  thus  completely losing  their
 former revolutionary spirit.
 These are mdivzdual cases which  are             frequently
 found  among  our  Communist  Party members.         The
 existence of such phenomena within the Party should
 serve as a serious warning to our Party members for it
 was almost an inevitable rule that such phenomena

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 existed among the revolutionaries of past generations.
 But such phenomena definitely will not be tolerated in
 our . Party.  The revolutionaries of past generations, prior
 to the success and victory of the revolution and their
 own success and victory, were able to represent the de-
 mands of the progressive and oppressed masses and retain
 their revolutionary qualities, but as soon as the revolution
 and they themselves were crowned with success and
 victory they would more often than not become corrupt
 ,
 bureaucratic and degenerate, thus losing their revolu-
 tionary  qualities  and  their progressive  character and
 becoming obstacles to the revolution and. social evolution.
 We know that many revolutionaries in China in the
 past hundred years, or  more  recently  in  the  past
 fifty years, began to show signs of corruption and de-
 generation the moment they had achieved a certain mea-
 sure of success and risen to some responsible position.
 This is due to the class basis of those revolutionaries of
 past generations. Because the revolutionaries of the past
 represented the exploiting classes they naturally turned
 around and oppressed the exploited masses after the
 victory of their revolution and thus became obstacles to
 the continuous progress of the revolution and social evolu-
 tion.  It is an inevitable rule that the revolutionaries of
 the past would become corrupt, bureaucratic and even
 degenerate and lose their revolutionary qualities after the
 victory and success of the revolution.
 However, this cannot and will not be the case with
 us Communists.  As the exploited proletariat which we
 represent does not exploit, anybody, it can carry on the
 10
 revolution to the very end completely
 liberate mankind
 as a whole and eventually make a clean sweep of all forms
 of corruption,  bureaucracy and degeneracy in human
 society.  It can build up a       and
 p   party      State apparatus with
 strict organisation             and   discipline f
 or  the  purpose  of
 carrying on an irreconcilable struggle
 against all forms
 of corruption, bureaucracy and degeneracy and to cease-
 lessly purge the Party and the
 Y          State apparatus of those
 elements who are corrupt, bureaucratic and degenerate
 in their work  no matter what 'big-wigs' ~    such
 elements
 are), so that the purity of the
 Party and the State
 apparatus can be preserved.
 This outstanding feature of the revolutionary Party
 of the proletariat was not and could not be, found in any
 of the revolutionary parties of the past.  Therefore, our
 Party members must clearly understand this outstanding
 feature and. see to it that even
 in the course of the success
 and victory of the revolution and in
 the course of the
 infinite rise of our popularity and authority special care
 is taken to intensify our self-cultivation and preserve to
 the last our pure revolutionary qualities y q   sties so as to avoid
 going the way of the revolutionaries               of the past who
 became degenerate after they had been crowned with
 success.
 Such revolutionary steeling and cultivation are im-
 portant for every one of our Party members and parti-
 cularly so for those new Party members of non-prolet-
 arian origin.  Why are they particularly important for
 new Party members  of non-proletarian  origin?   1
 ii.

 Precisely because such Party members Y                   are of non-prolet-
 arian origin.  Lenin said that Party members y         s of worker
 origin have the innate qualities  of the
 proletariat.   It
 follows then that Party members of other
 Y class origin
 naturally have the innate qualities of other classes   Al-
 though they have now accepted the Communist ideology,
 they more or less still retain remnants of non-Communist
 ideology and habits.       (2) Precisely because they are new
 Party members and have not yet undergone much steel-
 ing.  Therefore, they have to steel and cultivate them-
 selves in the course of the revolutionary struggle
 before
 they can become good revolutionaries.
 Steeling and cultivation are important for every
 Party member, whether he be a new member of non-
 proletarian proletarian origin or even a veteran m
 ember or a member
 ...N~~
 of proletarian origin.  This is because our Communist
 Party did not drop from the heavens but was born       of
 out o_
 Chinese society and because every member of our Party
 came from this squalid old society of China and are still
 living in this society today.  Hence our Party members
 y                     bers
 have more or less brought with them remnants
 of the
 ideology and habits of the old society and they remain
 in constant association with all the squalid things of
 the
 old society.  We are still in need of steeling and cultiva-
 tion in every respect for the sake
 Y                      of enhancing and pre-
 serving our purity as the proletarian vanguard and for
 the sake of raising our social qualities and revolutionary
 technique.
 That is the reason why Communist Party members
 must undertake self-cultivation.
 Strive to Become the Best Pupils
 of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin
 To become a Communist Party member one is only
 required to possess the qualifications
 as laid down in the
 Party Constitution--namel   an
 Y, any person may become a
 member of the Party who accepts the Programme and
 Constitution of the Party, pays Party membership dues
 and undertakes assigned tasks in one of the Party's
 organisations.  These are the minimum qualifications that
 every  Party    member  must  possess.
 Without these
 qualifications one cannot become a Party member.  But
 every one of our Party members should not merely be a
 member of minimum qualifications,  should not  merely
 be satisfied with and should not confine himself to these
 minimum qualifications but
 should rather seek to make
 progress and ceaselessly raise his own consciousness and
 understanding of Marxism-Leninism
 This is also a duty
 to the Party and to the revolution, which
 must not be
 shirked by any member of the Party.      This duty has also
 been included in the new Party Constitution recently
 adopted by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
 (B).  However, in order to fulfil
 this duty satisfactorily
 our Party members must intensify their own steeling and
 cultivation.
 Therefore, the goal of Party members Y          sin steeling and
 cultivation should not merely be the standard
 of minimum
 qualifications but should be the standard of maximum
 qualifications.  At  resent we find
 present           it very difficult to
 define these maximum qualifications.
 However, we have
 before us the words and deeds
 the achievements and
 13

 qualities of Marx  Engels     Lenin and Stalin throughout
 their lives as our examples
 and as the criterion. of our
 cultivation.   By cultivation is
 meant raising our own
 qualities in every respect to
 the same level as those of
 Marx, Engels, Lenin and
 .         ~             Stalin. Let us strive to become
 their best pupils.  In his
 speech concerning the elections
 to the Supreme Soviet Comrade Stalin said:
 The electors, the people, must demand that their Deputies
 should remain equal to their tasks; that in their work they
 should not sink to the level of political
 philistines; that in
 their posts they should remain political figgure
 s of the Lenin
 type; that as public figures they should be
 as clear and
 definite as Lenin was; that they should be as fearless '
 ~> in battle
 and as merciless towards the enemies of the people as Lenin
 was; that they should be free from all panic  from any
 semblance of panic as Lenin was, when thins begin to   t
 compli                                            g             ge
 cated and some danger or other looms on the horizon;
 that they should be as wise and deliberate in deciding com-
 plex problems requiring a comprehensive orientation and a
 comprehensive weighing of all pros and cons as Lenin was;
 that they should be as upright and honest as Lenin was; that
 they should love their people as Lenin did.
 This is a simple description of how to learn from
 Lenin, a picture of Lenin's best pupil.  The cultivation
 of Communist Party members is for the purpose of learn-
 ing from Lenin exactly in y   such a way in order to be such
 a pupil of Lenin.
 Some say that it is impossible
 to acquire the great
 qualities of revolutionary geniuses like Marx, Engels,
 .
 Lenin and Stalin and that it is also
 impossible to raise
 our own qualities to the same level as that of Marx,
 14
 Engels, Lenin and Stalin.  They regard Marx, Engels,
 Lenin and Stalin as mYy sterious
 beings by birth.   Is  it
 correct to say this?  I think not
 For so long as our comrades
 genuinely, resolutely,
 consciously and consistently take
 up their stand as the
 vanguard fighting for the liberation of
 the proletariat,
 have a truly Communist outlook on life and world out-
 look, and never divorce themselves for a single moment
 from the present-day great and profound revolutionary
 movements of the proletariat and the masses of the peo-
 ple, and make great efforts to learn, and to steel and
 cultivate themselves,  they will -               y    1 be perfectly able to raise
 their qualities and become as `clear
 and definite', as fear-
 less in battle and merciless towards the enemies of the
 people', as `free from all panic and from any semblance
 of panic' amidst difficulties
 and dangers, and as upright
 and honest' as Lenin was      and to 'love the people' as
 Lenin did, and they will also be
 perfectly able to employ
 the Marxist-Leninist method and approach in solving
 complicated problems in thinking
 b over the problems from
 all angles and in weighing all pros and cons notwith-
 standing the fact that today our ordinary
 comrades are
 far from having such great talents  such wide scientific
 knowledge, such an environment and good stamina for
 learning as had Marx Engels Lenin and
 Stalin and that
 a great many of our comrades cannot expect to achieve
 such profound erudition in
 the study of the theory of the
 proletarian revolution as did Marx           ~
 Engels, Lenin and
 Stalin.  In other words so long as
 we are determined to
 study hard, and cultivate and s
 a    ~ tee) ourselves, do not

 divorce ourselves from the revolutionary movement of
 the masses of the people, and master the method of
 Marxism-Leninism  we
 ,      will be perfectly able to raise
 our qualities to the level of those
 of the statesmen of the
 Lenin type, so that in our
 work and struggle we can
 employ the style of Marx, Engels,       and ,    gels, Lenin ancA Stalin that
 is, to `remain political figures of the Lenin type and not
 to `sink to the level of
 political philistines.'
 Mencius said:  'Everybody
 can be a Yao or a Shun.,*
 It means the same thing.      We should not resin our-
 b
 selves to despair and hesitate to go ahead when we first
 perceive the qualities of such great revolutionaries as
 Marx, Engels Lenin and Stalin.     To do so is to become
 just such a `political philistine' 'rotten wood that cannot
 be carved,' and `a mud wall.'
 1
 But different kinds of people
 adopt different kinds
 of attitudes towards learning from
 Marx, Engels, Lenin
 and Stalin.
 The first kind learns from Marx and Lenin without
 penetrating into the essence of Marxism-Leninism but
 merely acquires a smattering of
 Marxism-Leninism.  Al-
 though they read Marxist-Leninist literature over and
 * Yao and Shun are legendary figures in ancient Chine

 be carved; a mud wall will not receive the trowel.  This
 is the use of                                                  Yu!-  What

 over again and learn by heart many ready-made prin-
 ciples and conclusions from Marx  Engels, Lenin
 and
 Stalin, yet they are unable to flexibly apply Y       these prin-
 ciples  and  conclusions  as  methods to solve
 existing
 concrete and practical problems.  They feel content with
 reciting these principles and conclusions which they dot
 down. and make use of mechanically. Although the
 they work
 under the banner of Marxism and consider themselves as
 `genuine'  Marxists, nevertheless they are
 not genuine
 Marxists and their methods of work are
 exactly the
 opposite of Marxism-Leninism.
 Comrade Stalin wrote in an article in commemora-
 tion of the fiftieth anniversary of Lenin's birth
 Y                   day:
 There are two groups of Marxists.  Both work under the
 banner  of  Marxism  and      consider themselves  `genuine'
 Marxists.  Nevertheless, they are by no means identical.
 More, a veritable gulf divides them, for their methods of
 work are diametrically opposed to each other.
 The first group usually confines itself to an outward
 acceptance, to a ceremonial  avowal of Marxism.        Being
 unable or unwilling to grasp the essence of Marxism, being
 unable or unwilling to translate it into reality, it converts
 the living and revolutionary principles g                   y p     pies of Marxism into
 lifeless  and  meaningless  formulas.                              It  does  not  base its
 activities on experience, on what practical work teaches, but
 on quotations from Marx.    It does not derive its conclusions
 and directions from an analysis of actual realities, but from
 analogies and historical parallels.  Discrepancy between word
 and deed is the chief malady of this group.
 This is one kind of attitude towards learning from
 Marx and Lenin,

 The first kind of people once constituted a not incon-
 . siderable number within the Communist Party of China.
 The worst representatives among them were even worse
 than those mentioned above.  In fact, they never reall
 h                                                       Y
 had any intention of 'studying'
 Marxism-Leninism
 They
 did not concern themselves with the great proletarian
 character and the supreme qualities
 of Marx and Lenin.
 They attempted to imitate in a superficial wa     certain
 styles of Marx and Lenin picked
 up  at random some
 Marxist-Leninist terminology, regarded themselves as the
 Marx and Lenin of China
 posed as Marx and Lenin
 within the Party, and had the impudence to ask our Party
 members to respect them as we do Marx and Lenin  to
 support them as `leaders' and to offer them
 loyalty and
 devotion.  They also made bold to appoint themselves as
 `leaders,' climbed into responsible positions without wait-
 ing  to  be  nominated  by  others  issued                                  orders like
 patriarchs within the Party, attempted to teach our Party,
 abused everything within the Party and wilfully attacked
 punished and rode roughshod over Party members. This
 kind of people had no intention of 'studying Marxism-
 Leninism or fighting for
 the realisation of Marxism-
 Leninism but rather they were opportunists within the
 Party and brokers and black sheep in the cause of Com-
 munism.  It is beyond doubt that this kind of people
 within the Party should be opposed, exposed
 and burred
 in oblivion b   our Part
 by          y members.   And     our  Party
 members have already buried them in oblivion.     How-
 ever, can we say with full confidence that there are no
 more people of this kind               ~
 within the PartY     We cannot
 yet say so.
 18
 The second kind of
 people is just the opposite of the
 first.  They regard themselves first and foremost as pupils
 of Marx, Engels, Lenin and
 Stalin and try 'to master
 the
 essence, spirit and methods which made Marx            Engels
 Lenin and Stalin what they are.  They look
 up to the
 great personal characteristics of
 Marx, Engels Lenin and
 Stalin and their qualities as proletarian revolutionaries
 and Painstakingly carry on their own cultivation in
 the
 course of the revolutionary struggle and examine them-
 selves to see whether
 their way of dealing wi

 themselves behave are in
 conformity with the spirit of -.'l ~a                       ""_il

 likewise read over
 and over again the works

 Comrade Stalin said;
 The second group, on the other hand
 attaches prime
 importance not to the outward acceptance of Marxism, but
 to its realisation, its translation into reality               d
 .  What this group
 chiefly concentrates its attention on is determining the ways
 and means  of realising Marxism that       best answer  the
 situation and changing these ways and means as the situa-
 tion changes--to this group may be full
 Y         y applied Marx's
 saying that Marxists cannot rest content with interpreting
 the world, but must go farther and change it.  This group
 is known as the Bolsheviks, the Communists.
 This is another attitude towards learning from Marx
 Engels, Lenin and Stali                                   '
 in.
 Only the second attitude is correct.  Only by adopt-
 ing this attitude towards studying Marxism-Leninism can
 one avoid the mistake of 'drawing a tiger which looks
 like a dog' and improve one's ve ones own qualities so as to
 become a proletarian
 Communist revolutionary of the
 Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stal'
 m type.
 Those who really carry on
 painstaking self-cultiva-
 tion and who are faithful
 pupils of Marx, Engels Lenin
 and Stalin pay special attention to nothing other than
 the mastery of the Marxist-Leninist  standpoint  an
 and
 methods and the. solution of
 various problems facing the
 proletariat in the revolution in
 the same manner as did
 Marx, Engels Lenin and
 Stalin.  Apart from this, they
 don't care whether their position and prestige within th
 Part  ar                                      b          the
 y are high or low simply on that account.  They never
 claim to be the Marx or Lenin of China and never demand
 or harbour any illusion that others should respect
 them
 20
 21
 as they. respect Marx and Lenin.
 They do not consider
 themselves entitled to such a right and they know that
 to think so would be betraying Marx and Lenin and
 sinking to the level of political
 philistines.  However, it is
 precisely because of this and because of their courage and
 unrivalled ability in the revolutionary struggle that they
 win spontaneous respect and support from the rank and
 file of the Party.
 Comrades !  Of course it is                        ~
 no easy matter to tape
 Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin as our models in self-
 cultivation and to become their most faithful and best
 pupils.  It calls for an iron will
 and firm determination in
 the arduous struggle for the cause of the proletariat.  It
 calls for a life-long devotion to
 studying Marxism-Lenin-
 ism and putting it into practice in the course of the
 revolutionary struggles  of the broad masses,  and for
 steeling and cultivation in every aspect.
 The Aspects and Methods of Cultivation
 Comrades !  In order to become
 the most faithful and
 best pupils of Marx Engels, Lenin
 and Stalin we need
 to carry on cultivation in all aspects in
 the course of the
 long and great revolutionary struggle y    uggle of the proletariat
 and the masses of the people.              We
 need to carry on cul-
 tivation in the theories of Marxism-Leninism and in
 applying such theories in practice, cultivation in revolu-
 tionary strategy and tactics;
 Y              cultivation in studying and
 dealing with various problems according to the stand-
 point and methods of Marxism-
 Leninism; cultivation in
 ideology and moral character;
 cultivation in Party unity,

 as daily reminders of rules
 of personal conduct.   The
 Chinese scholars of the Confucian school had a
 number
 of methods for the cultivation of their. body and mind.
 Every religion has various methods and forms of cultiva-
 tion of its own.  The 'investigation of things, the exten-
 sion of knowledge, sincerity of thought, the rectification
 of the heart, the cultivation of the person, the regulation
 of the family, the ordering well of the state and the
 making tranquil of the whole. kingdom  as set forth in
 The Great Learning*
 also means the same.  All
 this
 shows that in achieving ones progress one must           make
 serious arid energetic efforts to carry on self-cultivation
 and study.  However, m
 many of these methods and forms
 cannot be adopted by us be
 Y        cause most of them are
 idealistic, formalistic, abstract
 and divorced from
 social
 practice.   These  scholars  and  religious  believers   ex-
 aggerate the function of subjective initiative, thinking
 that so long as they keep their
 general good intentions
 and are devoted to silent prayer they will be able
 to
 change the existing state of affairs, change society and
 change themselves under de~ conditions separated from s  '
 octal
 and revolutionary practice.
 This is, of course  absurd.
 We cannot cultivate ourselves in this  waY         We
 are
 materialists and our cultivation cannot be separated from
 practice.

 that we must not under
 any circumstances isolate ourselves from the revolu '

 inner-Party struggle and discipline ,
 cultivation in hard
 work and in the style of work; cultivation in being skilful
 in dealing with different kinds of        and in
 people        associat-
 ing with the masses of the people and cultivation in
 various kinds of scientific knowledge, etc.           We are all
 Communist Party members and so we have a general cul-
 tivation in common.  But there exists a wide discrepancy
 today between our Party members.  Wide discrepancy
 exists among us in the level of political consciousness in
 work, in position, in cultural level  in experience of
 struggle and in social origin. Therefore in addition to
 cultivation in general we also need special cultivation for
 different groups and for individual comrades.
 Accordingly,  there  should  be  different  kinds  of
 methods and forms of cultivation.  For example, many of
 our comrades keep a diary in order to have a daily check
 on their work and thoughts or they write down on small
 posters their personal defects and what they hope to
 achieve and paste them up where they work or live
 ,
 together with the photographs of persons they look up
 to and ask comrades for criticism and supervision.  In
 ancient China, there were many methods of cultivation.
 There was Tseng Tze * who said:   `I reflect on myself
 three times a day.'  The Book of Odes has it that one
 should cultivate oneself `as a lapidary cuts and files
 ,
 carves and polishes.' Another method was `to  examine
 oneself by y self-reflection' and to 'write down some mottoes
 on the right hand side of one's desk' or `
 on ones girdle'

 ary struggles of different kinds of
 people and in different
 forms at a given moment
 and that we must moreover,
 sum up historical                                        '
 p             revolutionary experience and
 learn
 humbly from this and
 put it into practice.  That is to say,
 we must undertake self-cultivation and steel ourselves in
 the course of our own practice, basing ourselves on the
 experiences of past re                                                 j
 r       volutionary practice on the
 present
 concrete situation and on new experiences.   Our self-
 cultivation and steeling are for no other purpose than that
 of revolutionary practice.   That  is to  say, we must
 modestly try to understand the standpoint, the method
 and the spirit of Marxism-Leninism, and understand how
 Marx, Engels Lenin and Stalin dealt with people.  And
 having understood these
 we should immediately apply
 them to our own Aractice i.e., in our own lives, words
 deeds and work.  Moreover, we should stick to them and
 unreservedly correct and pure everything
 g             in our ideology
 that runs counter to them
 thereby strengthening our
 own proletarian and Communist ideology and qualities.
 That is to say, we must modestly listen to the opinions
 and criticisms of our comrades and of the masses care-
 fully study the practical problems in our lives and in our
 work and carefully sum up our experiences and the lessons
 we have learnt so as to find an
 orientation for our own
 work.  In addition on the
 basis of all these  we must
 judge  whether  we have   a  correct understanding,  of          ~
 Marxism-Leninism and whether we have correctly appli-
 ed the method of Marxism-Leninism, found out our own
 shortcomings and mistakes and corrected them.  At the
 same time, we must find out in what respects specific
 conclusions of Marxism-Lenini
 sm need to be suPplement-
 .~
 24
 ed, enriched and developed on the basis of well-digested
 new experiences.  That is to say, we must combine the
 universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete
 practice of the revolution.
 These should be the methods of self-cultivation of us
 Communist Party members.  That is to say, we must
 use the methods of Marxism-
 Leninism to cultivate our-
 selves.  This kind of cultivation is
 entirely different from
 other kinds of cultivation which
 are idealistic and  are
 divorced from social practice.
 In this connection we cannot but oppose certain idle
 talk and mechanicalism on the question of cultivation and
 steeling.
 First of all, we must oppose and resolutely eliminate
 one of the biggest evils bequeathed to us b
 by the education
 and learning in the old society-the separation of theory
 from practice.  In the course of education and study in
 the old society many people le though
 Y P  p          t that it was un-
 necessary or even impossible to act upon what they had
 learned.  Despite the fact that they read over and over
 again books by ancient sages they did things the sages
 would have been loath to do.     Despite the
 fact that in.
 everything they wrote or said they preached righteous-
 ness and morality they acted like out-and-out robbers
 and harlots in everything they did.. Some high-ranking
 officials' issued orders for the re

 trative work they ruthlessly extorted exorbitant requisi-
 tions, ran amuck with corruption and killing, and did
 everything against righteousness                       and morality.   Some
 people read the Three People's Principles over and over
 again and could recite the Will of Dr. Sum Yat-sen, yet
 they  oppressed the people,                        opposed  the nations who
 treated us on an equal footing, and went so far as to
 compromise with or surrender to the national enemy.
 Once a scholar of the old school told me himself that the
 only maxim of Confucius that he could observe was:  `To
 him food can never be too dainty; minced meat can never
 be too fine,' adding that all the rest of the teachings of
 Confucius he could not observe and had never proposed
 to observe.   Then why did the..  till still ..,  .,.~,,  ~i,~,y          want to  carry on
 educational work and study the teachings of the sages?
 Apart from utilising them for window-dressing purposes,
 their objects were:   (1) to make use of these teachings
 to oppress the exploited and to make use of righteousness
 and morality for the purpose of hoodwinking and sup-
 pressing the culturally backward people, (2) to attempt
 thereby to secure better government jobs, make money
 and achieve fame and reflect credit on their parents.
 Apart from these objects, their actions were not restricted
 by the sages' teachings.
 This was the attitude and return
 of the `men of letters' and `scholars' of the old society to
 the sages they 'worshipped.'  Of course we Communist
 Party members cannot adopt such an attitude in studying
 Marxism-Leninism and the excellent and useful teachings
 bequeathed to us by our ancient sages.  We must live up
 to what we say.  We are honest and pure and we cannot
 deceive ourselves the people or our predecessors.  This is

 revolution that we study.
 an outstanding characteristic as well as a great merit of
 us Communist Party members
 Comrades!  Is it not possible that the evil legacy of
 the old society still exerts some influence upon us?  It
 does influence us.  Among you students there are      of
 course, none who try to study Marxism for the sake of
 obtaining higher government posts, making money or
 oppressing the exploited.  You are
 studying Marxism for
 the sake of eliminating the                        f
 system of exploitation o~ man
 by man.  However  I cannot guarantee that you have
 lived up to all that
 you have learnt.  Are there none
 among you who think in
 the following waY            ~ That is to
 ~
 say that their thoughts, words,
 deeds and lives need not
 be guided by the              -
 principles of Marxism-Leninism and that
 the principles they have learnt need not be put into prac-
 tice.  Again are there none among you who think that
 they study Marxism-Leninism and study profound theory
 in order that they may get pro
 Y g      motion, to show themselves
 off and to make themselves  celebrities?   i have no
 guarantee that there are absolutely none among you who
 think this way.  Yet this
 way of thinking does not con-
 form to Marxism and it represents a gap between Marxist
 theory and Marxist Practice.
 We have. no objection to the
 study of theory and moreover
 we must. study theory, but
 what we have learnt we must put into practice.  We study
 for the sole purpose of putting into
 practice what we have
 learnt.  It is for the Party and for the victory of the

 the theory you have learn                         ~
 t with your own practice?  Are
 there not still some
 people among you whose practice is
 entirely divorced from the principles of Marxism-Lenin-
 ism?  It seems that there
 are still people among you
 who understand the combination of theory and practice
 in the following way:           They  want  comrades working
 des                  nThey want     "~/~~~~
 outside the school to come to report
 on their experiences
 so as to see how others combine theory with practice.
 This is of course a combination
 of theory and practice but
 it is theirs and not yours.  I think the fact that you shout
 the slogan ought to mean that you y       should combine the
 theory you study with your own practice.
 If you do not
 understand this point in such a way, then what  is  the
 ..,,
 use  of your shouting the slogan?         I will give another
 example.   You have shouted many slo
 bans about the
 need for steeling yourselves  but are there not some
 people among you who have shown themselves anything
 but steeled or have shown that they could not stand up
 to being steeled when the hour of real
 test came, when
 they met with a rebuff, or when they were subjected to
 criticism and punishment, to the pressure of public opinion,
 and to the correct or incorrect supervision of the great
 majority of the people?  They forgot that
 a Communist
 Party member should have a firm will and clear stand
 Point etc.  They looked defected, not knowing what to
 do.  Are these not examples of empty talk
 about steeling
 and cultivation?
 As a matter of fact, the training you receive and the
 study you make in school are also forms of
 _                                             steeling and
 cultivation.  We are trying to make you into useful cadres
 and Party workers through training and studying  in
 school, not just to  et you g   Y    to learn only some abstract
 `theory' and Marxist-Leninist terminology and formulas.
 Moreover, we want
 you to cultivate and steel ourselves
 so   as   to  become cadres, who can think correctly, have a
 firm will and be able to solve in a practical way all
 kinds of complex problems.  However, I have often heard
 it said that to study in school is not the way to become
 steeled and that in order
 to steel and cultivate oneself
 one must leave school and take up practical work.  Com-
 rades !  Steeling and cultivation are u ~   l life~~c-,    and .. are  life-long and many-
 sided task.  They are needed everywhere at all times and
 in relation to all problems.  We cannot say that we can
 undertake steeling and cultivation on only at certain times,
 in certain places
 , in connection with certain matters but
 not at other times, in other places
 and in connection with
 other matters, although we             ~
 don't deny the fact that Com-
 munist Party members should steel and cultivate them-
 selves mainly in the course of
 the practical struggle of
 the masses.
 That is why we are opposed to idealism, idle talk and
 mechanicalism on the problem. of
 cultivation.  That is to
 say we should be able to stand up to p    being steeled.  We
 should steel ourselves in school, among the masses,
 g               and
 in the struggles both inside
 and outside the Party.      We
 should study and cultivate ourselves under all circum-
 stances, both of victory and Y                                                                                                                             defeat.

 As to Marxism... ,differences in profundity of under-
 standing require a class explanation.  For example, at- the
 present time, in the epoch of the decay of capitalism, no
 matter how talented some ideologist of the bourgeoisie may
 be, his creative ability, his ability to obtain a penetrating
 understanding of the laws of development are `constrained'
 by his class nature, by the conservatism of the class he
 represents.  The inability of the bourgeoisie to foresee the
 future, determines, narrows down the limits and reduces the
 depth of understanding of the phenomena of social develop-
 ment by bourgeois theoreticians.  Notwithstanding all their
 talents, ideologists of those classes which are passing from
 the stage of history are not in a position to make really
 profound scientific conclusions and discoveries.  This Marxist
 truth has been confirmed by the whole history of the
 development of science and philosophy.  Dialectical and
 Historical Materialism, Part I, p285 of the Russian edition,
 edited by M. Mitin.  OGIZ. Moscow 1934)
 Marxism-Leninism is the science of the proletarian
 revolution.  It can be thoroughly understood and master-
 ed only by those who fully take the proletarian standpoint
 and who adopt the ideals of the proletariat as their own.
 It is impossible for anyone to thoroughly understand and
 master the Marxist science of the proletariat, only by
 means of his intellect and strenuous study if he lacks the
 firm standpoint and pure ideals of the proletariat.  This
 is also an obvious truth.   Therefore, in studying the
 theory and method of Marxism-Leninism today it is
 necessary that our study proceeds simultaneously with
 our ideological cultivation and steeling because without
 the theory and method of Marxism-Leninism, we should
 have nothing to guide our thoughts and actions and our
 ideological cultivation would also be impossible.  These
 two are closely related to each other and are inseparable.
 We have often come across some of the best Party
 members of working class origin who are less developed
 in the theory of Marxism-Leninism as compared with
 .
 those who are making a special study of theory.  They
 would . certainly prove less proficient if asked to recite
 Marxist-Leninist formulas or quotations from Marxist-
 Leninist. works.  But when it comes to studying the
 theory of Marxism-Leninism,quite often their interest is
 keener and their understanding deeper than those Party

 The Relation Between the Study of Marxist-Leninist Theory
 and the Ideological Cultivation of Party Members
 Among our Communist Party members a compara-
 tively prevalent way of thinking is the followinbg:  The
 firm and pure proletarian. Communist standpoint has
 nothing to do with a Communist Party member's under-
 standing and mastery of the  theory  and method         of
 Marxism-
 Leninism.  They think that although their class
 standpoint is not very firm and their ideology not very
 pure (they still retain remnants of the ideology of other
 classes, and they are still selfish and have worldly desires
 and so on), they can nevertheless thoroughly understand
 and master the theory and method of Marxism-Leninism
 all the same.  Some comrades think that it is possible to
 thoroughly master the theory and method of Marxism-
 Leninism merely by means of one's own intellect ability
 and study.  Comrades !  This way of thinking is wrong.
 Mitin, a Soviet philosopher, is quite right when he
 says:

 members of student origin,
 provided it is explained to
 them in words they understand.   For example the chap-
 ter in Capital dealing with the theory of surplus value ,c
 most curficult for some Party members to understand but
 i
 i
 t
 s not so diffilt fb
 cuor memers of working class origin
 ,
 because workers fully understand ~-
 Y      stand how in the i7rnrPCC  of
 production the capitalists calculate wages and w
 b orxing
 h
 ours how thkfi
 ,ey mae prots and how they expand
 reproduction, etc.  Therefore it often happens that they
 are able to understand Marx's theory of surplus value
 more deeply than other Party members.  Especially in
 observing and dealing with various practical problems
 they often prove more apt, more  correct and mrn?P  in
 contormity with the principles of Marxism-
 Leninism than
 otners.  Why is this so?  It is because they h
 hav
 e the firm
 1
 ,
 pure proletarian and Communist standpoint
 and ideals,
 an objective attitude towards things, and in their minds
 they have no pre-conceived ideas whatever, no worries
 about personal problems or about impure matters.  There-
 fore, they can immediately perceive the truth of things
 and courageously uphold the truth without
 any hesitation
 or difficulty.
 If among us Communist Party members there are
 still some whose class standpoint is not very clear-cut and
 firm, whose ideology is not correct and pure, who still
 retain to some degree remnants of various kinds of
 ideology, habits and prejudices of other classes and of the
 old society and who still have
 personal interests and
 private ends and all kinds of worldly desires and selfish
 ideas, Marxist-Leninist principles  and  conclusions  are
 certain to clash with all such things of theirs when they
 come to study the theory and  method  of  Marxism-
 Leninism.  In that case, they will either try to overcome
 such things of theirs or try to distort the principles and.
 conclusions of Marxism-Leninism to suit their prejudices,
 thus  preventing  them  from  understanding Marxism-
 Leninism.                                                                                                                                They will be unable to penetrate deeply into
 the essence of Marxism-Leninism, to absorb the quin-
 tessence of Marxism-Leninism which has a distinct class
 character and to make this quintessence a weapon of their
 own because such a weapon has nothing in common with
 their former class ideology.
 Again, when they deal with various practical pro-
 blems in the course of the proletarian revolution  the
 solution of these problems in accordance with Marxism-
 Leninism will often be incompatible with their habits and
 prejudices and will be in conflict with their personal inter-
 ests.  Under such circumstances, they will show them-
 selves to be petty-minded, irresolute, hesitant and waver-
 ing.  They will be unable to deal with problems aptly,
 correctly and in an objective way, or to perceive truth
 without difficulty or to courageously uphold the truth.
 They will go so far as to cover up or distort the truth con-
 sciously or unconsciously.  Comrades !  Such cases are by
 no means rare and strange but are of common occurrence.
 Thus we can say:  If a Communist Party member
 lacks the clear-cut, firm, correct and pure standpoint and
 ideology of the proletariat, it will be impossible for him
 to thoroughly understand and master the theory and

 CHAPTER TWO
 method of Marxism-Lehi '
 nism and to make of it a weapon
 in his own revolutionary struggle.
 Therefore  first and foremost in the cultivation of
 Communist Party members should be ideological cultiva-
 tion which is the foundation of all other cultivations.
 This I shall speak about in the following.
 C OMRADES !  IN DEALING WITH the ideological cul-
 tivation of Communist Party members,   I  Shall   try
 ,, ,, to
 discuss this problem on the basis of certain phenomena
 as manifested in the ideology of some members of our
 Party.  What I am going to talk about in this connection
 is only the most basic ideology of Party members.
 THE  IDEOLOGICAL  CULTIVATION  OF
 PARTY  MEMBERS
 What, after all, is meant by ideological cultivation?
 I consider that it is in the main a struggle in our minds
 between the ideology of the proletariat and other ideo-
 logies; a struggle in our minds between
 the Communist
 outlook on life and the Communist world outlook on the
 one hand, and all other outlooks, on life and world out-
 looks on the other; and a struggle between two concepts:
 the personal interests and aims of Party members and
 the interests and aims of the Party and of the people.
 I consider that this is a struggle of conflicting ideas
 -~         reflecting the
 economic and political demands of different
 84

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 classes in a given society.  The outcome of this
 struggle,
 so far as the ideology of our Party members is concerned,
 should be the conquest and even elimination of     A
 all other
 ideologies by the proletarian ideology; ? the con
 quest and
 even elimination of all other outlooks on life and world
 outlooks  by  the Communist  outlook on  life and the
 Communist world outlook; the conquest and absorption
 of the idea of the Party members' personal interests and
 aims by the idea of the common interests and aims
 of
 the Party, of the revolution, and of the liberation of the
 proletariat and mankind.  Should the outcome prove to
 be otherwise; then it would mean the  conquest of the
 latter by the former and the Party member would become
 backward arid even lose his qualifications as a Communist
 Party member.  To us Party members this would indeed
 be a dreadful and disastrous outcome.
 It is in the course of all the ideological, political and
 economic struggles both inside and outside the Party that
 we Communists temper our own ideas and come to under-
 stand the realities of the revolution.  At the same time
 we should constantly sum up and absorb the experiences
 gathered from revolutionary practice and examine our
 own ideas to see whether they are completely  in con-
 formity with Marxism-Leninism and with the interests
 of the struggle for the liberation of the proletariat.  To
 eliminate in the course of such a study, reflection and self-
 examination all our incorrect ideas and to nip in the bud
 even the faintest idea which runs counter to the inter-
 ests of Communism--this is what we mean by ideo-
 36
 logical cultivation.  It is also a form of
 ideological self-
 steeling.
 Comrades !  As
 you are aware, all the actio
 are                                               ns of man
 guided by his ideology.  Furthermore t,

 his outlook on life and his world outlook as a general
 guide to his ideas and actions. Therefor
 e, in carrying on
 ideological cultivation we Communists must  first of
 all,
 clearly defin                                ,
 e our outlook on life
 _                          and our world outlook
 because all our ideas and activities are connected with

 also the methodology of us Com-

 works of Marx and Lenin on philosophy and since you
 have learnt a great deal about it, I am not going to talk
 about this         Here
 i shall speak only briefly about
 how we should understand our own cause-what, after
 all, is the cause of Communism and how should we Com-
 munist Party members
 further our cause?
 What is the most fundamental and common duty of
 us Communist Party members?  As everybody knows
 it is to establish Comm                                '

 good or not? We all know that it is
 -                        very good. In such a
 world there will be no exploiters oppressors,
 landlords,
 capitalists, imperialists or fascists.   There will be no
 oppressed and exploited people, no darkness, ignorance
 backwardness etc.  In such a society all human beings
 will become unselfish and intelligent Communists with a
 --
 hi h level of culture and technique.                        The spirit of mutual
 assistance and mutual love will prevail among mankind.
 There, will be no such irrational thins as mutual
 things
 mutual antagonism, mutual slaughter and war, etc.
 Such a society will, of course, be the best  the most
 beautiful and the most advanced society in the history
 of, mankind.  Who will say that such  a society is not
 good?    Here the question arises:  Can Communist society
 J
 be brought about?   Our answer is `yes.'   About this
 the whole theory of Marxism-Leninism offers a scientific
 explanation that leaves no room for doubt., It further
 explains that as the ultimate result of the class struggle
 of mankind, such a society will inevitably be brought
 about.  The victory of Socialism in the U.S.S.R. has also
 given us factual proof.  Our duty is, therefore, to brin
 >                    g
 about at an earlier date this Communist society, the
 realisation of which is inevitable in the history of man-
 kind.
 This is one aspect. This is our ideal.
 But we should understand the other aspect that is
 in spite of the fact that Communism can be  and will
 inevitably be realised it is still confronted by powerful
 enemies that 'must be thoroughly and finally defeated in.
 38
 every respect before Communism can be realised.  Thus
 the cause of Communism is a loner  bitter, arduous but
 victorious process of struggle.  Without such a struggle
 there could be no Communism.     Of course this struggle
 .
 is not, as some people have said  an `accidental' social
 phenomenon or something engineered by  certain Corn-
 .
 munists who are `rebellious by nature.'  On the contrary,
 it is an inevitable phenomenon in the course of the
 development of a class society.  It is a class struggle which
 is unavoidable.  The birth of the Communist Party, the
 participation of the Communists in the struggle, their
 bb
 organisation and direction of the struggle are also inevit-
 able phenomena which are in conformity with the laws
 of  social  development.   Because imperialists  fascists,
 capitalists and landlords-in short the exploiters-have
 oppressed and exploited the overwhelming majority of
 mankind to such an extent that the oppressed and ex-
 ploited people can hardly live, they cannot but unite to
 oppose this oppression and exploitation; otherwise they
 cannot live and develop.  Consequently, this struggle is
 an entirely natural and unavoidable phenomenon.  On the
 one hand, we must understand that the cause of Com-
 munism is the greatest cause in the history of mankind
 because  Communism  will  eventually  abolish    classes,
 liberate the whole of mankind and raise human society
 to heights o      is of happiness unparalleled in the history of
 mankind.  On the other hand, we must also understand
 that the t t e cause of
 _ Communism is the most arduous cause
 in the history of mankind because Communism must
 triumph over an extremely powerful enemy--the exploit-

 Lenin said:
 . The abolition of classes means not only driving out the
 and capitalists-that we have accomplished with
 landlords
 comparative ease-it also means abolishing the small com-
 modity producers, and they cannot be driven out, or crushed;
 we must live in harmony with them; they can(and must)
 be remoulded and re-educated only by very prolonged, slow,
 cautious organisational work.  They encircle the proletariat
 on every side with a petty-bourgeois atmosphere, which
 permeates and corrupts the proletariat and causes constant
 relapses among the proletariat into petty-bourgeois spineless
 individualism, and alternate moods of exalta-
 ness, disunity,                                               -
 tion and dejection.  The strictest centralism and discipline
 are required within the political party of the proletariat
 in order to counteract this, in order that the organisational
 role of the proletariat (and that is its principal role) may
 be exercised correctly, successfully, victoriously. .. .The force
 of habit of millions and tens of millions is a most terrible
 force.... It is a thousand times easier to vanquish the
 centralised big bourgeoisie than to `vanquish' the millions
 and millions of small owners; yet they, by their ordinary,
 everyday,  imperceptible,  elusive,  demoralising  activity,
 achieve the very results which the bourgeoisie need and
 :which tend to restore the bourgeoisie....
 Lenin again said:
 . ,  the bourgeoisie, whose resistance is increased tenfold
 by its overthrow (even if only in one country), and whose
 power lies not only in the strength of international capital,
 in the strength and durability of the international connections
 of the bourgeoisie, but also in the force of habit, in the

 to achieve victory we must conduct a sharp struggle not
 only against the exploiting classes but also against the
 prolonged influences of the exploiting classes among the
 masses, against the backward ideology and phenomena
 among the masses so that we can raise their consciousness
 and unite them to defeat the exploiting classes.  Herein
 lies the difficulty we face in the struggle for the cause
 of Communism.
 Comrades !  If the masses were all conscious united
 and free from the influences of the exploiting classes and
 from backward phenomena as certain people imagine
 ,
 then what difficulties would still remain in the revolution?
 Such influences of the exploiting classes not only existed
 long before the revolution but will continue, to exist for
 a very long time after the victory of the revolution and
 after the exploiters have been kicked out of their position
 of political power by the exploited classes.  Just pause
 to think: how many complicated and difficult tasks and
 struggles shall we have to undertake if we are to liberate
 and change the whole of mankind, to finally defeat the
 exploiting classes and their influences among the people
 to reform tens of millions of small commodity
 producers,
 to eventually abolish classes and to raise, step by step,
 mankind which for thousands of years has lived in class
 society with all kinds of old customs  traditions and
 backward phenomena  (in such a society mankind is
 divided into classes and nations who fight and kill one
 another and thus create the ideas and customs of selfish-
 ness, mutual deception and mutual antagonism) and to

 strength  of  small  production.  For,  unfortunately,  small
 production is still very, very widespread in the world and
 small production engenders capitalism and the bourgeoisie
 continuously, daily, hourly, spontaneously, and on a mass
 stale.  For all these reasons the dictatorship of the proletariat
 is essential, and victory over the bourgeoisie is impossible

 The first consideration of people with such ideas is
 their position in the Party.  They like to show off, and
 want others to flatter them and admire them.  They have
 a personal ambition to become leaders.  They take ad-
 vantage of their abilities and like to claim creditI to show
 off themselves, to keep everything in their hands and the
 Y
 are intolerant.  They are full of vanitY9 do not want to
 bury their heads in hard work and are unwilling to do
 technical work.   They are haughty.  When they have
 made some small achievements they            .~ become very arrogant
 and domineering as if there were no one else like them
 in the world.  They seek to overshadow others and cannot
 treat others on equal terms, modestly
 __~ and politely.  They
 are self-conceited and like to lecture others9 to instruct
 and boss others.  They are always trying to climb above
 others, and do not accept directions from others do not
 learn modestly from others and particularly from the
 masses, nor do they accept criticisms from others.       They
 like to be `promoted' but cannot stand being `demoted.'
 They can only work `in fair weather' but not `in foul.'
 They cannot bear attacks or injustices
 and are unable
 to adapt themselves to circumstances.  They are not `great
 men capable of asserting themselves when necessary or
 of keeping in the background when required.'  They have
 not yet got rid of their deep-rooted `desire for fame' and
 they try to build themselves up into          men'
 P       'great       and
 `heroes' in  the Communist  cause
 and even have no
 scruples in employing any means for the
 g   Y                 gratification of
 such desires.   However,  when  their  aims  cannot be
 achieved, when.
 ~iey receive rebuffs or     cool  treatment
 from comrades in, the Party, there is a possible
 danger
 66
 of their wavering.  In the history of the Party there have
 been not a few members who left the Party because of
 such wavering.  In the minds of such persons there exist
 remnants of the ideology of the exploiting classes.  They
 do not understand the greatness of Communism, nor do
 they have the broad vision of a Communist.
 Communists should not indulge in self-complacency
 or   haughtiness.   Granted  certain  comrades  are  very
 competent    and have  rune  certain  work  well and made
 competent    uaau   as
 great achievements.  For example, our army officers led
 thousands upon thousands of men and won victories, or
 our  Party and mass-work  leaders     in various, places
 through their work brought about a much more favourable
 situation.   Theirs may probably be `great' achievements
 of which they may be proud, yet compared with the cause
 of Communism as a whole how great are these achieve-
 ments after all?  Their achievements are but `a drop in
 the ocean.'  To a person with a Communist world outlook,
 what is there in this that one may be really proud of?
 So far as individual Party members are concerned
 how can one's personal position be worth worrying about?
 One's position can never be higher than that of  an
 emperor,  nevertheless,  comparing  the  position  of an
 emperor with that of a fighter for the cause of Communism,
 how great is it' after all?  It is only `a drop p   in the ocean9'
 as Stalin has said.  So what is there that is worth worry-
 ing and bragging about?
 Yes, in our Party, in the Communist cause, we need
 countless numbers    of Communist heroes and a great

 many Party and mass leaders with         and
 prestige     position.
 At present  we really have far too few revolutionary
 heroes and leaders with prestige.    We still need to temper
 and cultivate a great
 number of very good Co
 mmunist
 revolutionary heroes
 and leaders in all fields.  This is a
 very important thing in g   our cause -which
 d.                                 simply cannot be
 negIecte    Whoever shows contempt for this point simply
 does not understand how
 to advance the Communist
 cause.    Therefore,  we must
 still greatly enhance our
 party  nne111bCrs'  keenness and aspiration for progress
 in
 the revolutionary cause.               we present ;~ e are not
 doing
 enough in this respect.   This point shows itself, for
 instance, in the fact that certain Party members
 studYin                                              are not
 g hard enough and their
 interest in politics and
 theory is not deep enough.
 Therefore we oppose individual heroism an
 ,                                         and show-
 ing-off out we certainly do not oppose such aspiration
 fcr progress among our members-this is a most precious
 quality of Communist Party members,
 . But the proletarian
 and Communist aspiration for progress is entirely differ-
 ent ent from the individualistic,
 aspiration for pr
 forme                                          ogress.  The
 r seeks truth, upholds
 truth and moreover
 most                                                 fights
 effectively for truth.  It has a perspective of un-
 limited. development and is of a
 th                                 progressive nature.  But
 the latter, as far as
 the individual li                                       goes
 , is extremely
 mated in its
 progressive nature and furthermore has no
 perspective,   because   for
 the sake of  the individual's
 personal interests it often
 consciously negates covers
 or distorts truth. T                                    up
 herefore, our comrades must under-

 as a leader or who in-
 dividually tries to become a leader can never become a

 local, have achieved
 success through mass support.  The

 not support as their leaders

 personal ambition for leadership
 and vanity.  No Party memho? has  the 6110  1'1116 _ht

 A Communist should do any work that is important
 at the
 time no matter whether the work is to his liking or not
 or whether it can win popularity or not.  For example,
 following the victory of the Russian revolution many
 cadres doing important Party and political work were
 mobilised to learn the art of trade for the purpose
 of
 carrying out the New Economic Policy, for at that time
 only by carrying on trade efficiently could the Communist
 Party  triumph  over private capitalism.   Even though
 none of the Party i'nembers liked to do trade yet they
 all did it because it was important.  It was right that they
 did it,  and it would have been wrong if they had
 not.
 Here, let me repeat; Party leaders in assigning work
 s
 to Party members should naturally take into considera-
 tion                                                                                                                   the  different  circumstances  of  individual  Party
 members, see to it that the work assigned to them should
 suit their personality and help to develop their strong
 points  and  encourage  their  enthusiasm                  for progress.
 However, the Party member to whom the work is assigned
 should not refuse the assignment on such grounds.
 Fourthly, there are a small number of comrades in
 the Party who strongly reflect the ideology of the ex-
 ploiting classes.  In dealing with Party comrades' and
 inner-Party problems
 they often adopt methods used in
 coping with the enemy, being utterly devoid of the great,
 sincere, Communist      and  proletarian  spirit  of  mutual
 assistance and solidarity.

 them to do such work would be a great loss to the
 of us.  We ordinary Party members also carry out a part
 of the work and shoulder a part of the responsibility in
 the cause of Communism.  Our part is of course much
 smaller than that of  Marx, Engels,  Lenin or Stalin.
 Nevertheless we all have our part. Although there is a
 difference between a great part. and a small part, it is
 a part all the same.  Therefore if we can do a part of the
 work well, it means that we have fulfilled our duty.
 Of course, we should try our best to do a bigger part.
 But if we cannot, we can still do a smaller part just as
 well.  So far as we individually are concerned, this is
 nothing worth while worrying about.  In any case, we
 should at least try not to obstruct the development of the
 Communist cause  and should do our part of the work
 ,
 be it big or small.  That is the attitude we should adopt
 be                                                     ~
 towards our own work.  There are certain comrades who
 are not willing to do technical work, thinking that to do
 so is to belittle themselves, and that it would prevent
 them from becoming famous in-later generations (actually
 they can like Edison and Stakhanov, etc. who all rose
 from among technical workers), and prevent them from
 displaying their talents.  They seem to think that for
 Communist cause.  Therefore, they more or less lose the
 aspiration for progress required of all Party members.
 Comrades!   Such a way of thinking is incorrect!
 Technical work plays an extremely important part in our
 Party work.  Those comrades who are doing such work
 are also doing their part for the cause of Communism in
 the same way as comrades doing other kinds of work.
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 Persons with such an ideology seek to elevate and
 develop themselves in the Party, but y,    t they achieve this
 purpose by holding others down and obstructing
 their
 development.   They want to jump over
 the heads of
 others and are jealous of those who
 are more capable.
 They feel displeased if others  o ahead of them, catch
 up with them or overtake them.  They will not be
 Y             pleased
 until they have succeeded in keeping others down or
 behind them.  They are not willing to be under lUCl others.
 They only care about their own well-being, their own
 development, without any consideration for
 Y                   the difficulties
 of others.  When they see other comrades meet with
 difficulties, setbacks, frustration or attacks they are t7aPPY
 over  the  calamity,  secretly  rejoice  and  are  entirely
 devoid of sympathy.  They even scheme to injure
 Y                     injure other
 comrades, to `throw stones at them when they are already
 down the well' and take advantage of the weak points
 and difficulties of other comrades to attack them and ruin
 their reputation.  In the Party they also take advantage
 of the weaknesses in the Party's
 organisation and work
 to serve their ulterior purposes, to garner certain personal
 benefits by means of exacerbating such weaknesses.  In
 the Party they are fond of spreading rumours speaking
 ill of others behind their backs and scheming to drive a
 wedge in the relations between comrades.  They like to
 take part in all the unprincipled disputes in the Part
 Y,
 and take great. interest in all `controversies.' Especially
 when  the  Party  is  in  difficulties,
 Y                         they create and
 exacerbate such controversies inside the Party.
 72
 In short, they are thoroughly vicious and not in the
 least upright.  Is it not a sheer ;eke to say that such
 persons ns can master the theory and method of Marxism-
 Leninism, and can reflect the ideology of the proletariat?
 Quite evidently, theirs is absolutely the reflection of the
 ideology of the declining exploiting classes because all
 exploiters, in order to develop themselves, will impair
 the interests of others.  To increase their own wealth or
 to prevent themselves from going bankrupt during a
 depression, the capitalists crowd out a great many smaller
 capitalists, and compel countless workers to starve.  To
 expand their land, the landlords exploit the peasants and
 deprive many. of  their   landholdings.  Fascist countries
 like Germany, Italy and Japan, to expand themselves,
 hindered the development of other countries and con-
 quered  Austria,                                                                                                                        Czechoslovakia,  Ethiopia,  etc.   and
 committed  aggression  against  China.   To  impair  the
 interests of others and to render others bankrupt are
 conditions essential to the development of the exploiters
 themselves, whose happiness is founded upon others'
 sufferings.
 Therefore, among exploiters it is impossible to find
 genuine  firm unity,  genuine  mutual  assistance  and
 genuine human sympathy.   The exploiters must work
 out treacherous  schemes  and  underhanded    measures
 against others, for it profits them to undo others or to
 render them bankrupt.  Nevertheless, they are compelled
 to tell lies and pose before the masses as pseudo-saints
 and 'supporters of justice'. These are the characteristics
 of all exploiters in their decline. Such things, however

 are also reflected in the ideology of some people in
 our
 Party.  To the exploiters such thins may be the standard
 of their `noble' ethics; but to
 the proletariat, they are
 outright treason.
 The proletariat is entirely different from what has
 just been described.   The proletariat does not
 exploit
 others, but is exploited by others.  There are no
 basic
 conflicts in interests among the workers or between
 the
 workers and all the other oppressed and exploited toiling
 masses.  To develop themselves and to win their own
 emancipation, the workers not only have no need to
 impair the interests and development of other workers
 or toiling people, but have need of uniting with other
 workers and toiling people.  Only then can the workers
 develop themselves, raise their own position and eman-
 cipate themselves.  The emancipation of the proletariat
 itself must be accompanied by the emancipation of  all
 toiling people and mankind as a whole.  It is impossible
 to  separately emancipate  an individual   worker  or a
 section
 of  the  workers. The  cause  of  emancipating
 humanity must be carried out to the end    and it is
 impossible to stop or compromise halfway.  And it must
 be the common     complete
 emancipation of humanity as
 a whole.
 The ideology of the awakened workers, reflecting this
 objective situation    t the proletariat, is entirely contrary
 to the ideology of the exploiters.
 gy                    On the one hand, they
 must of course employ the most merciless measures in
 dealing with the common enemy of the people; on the
 74
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108/11: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 other hand, they never employ such measures in dealing
 with their own brothers and comrades, thus clearly differ-
 entiating their attitude and measures adopted  against
 their enemy from those directed towards their friends
 and comrades.  They have             Sincere   e
 y      a great and friendship,
 love and sympathy for their own class brothers and for
 all the toiling people who are being exploited and oppress-
 ed.                                                                                                                They display a great spirit of mutual assistance, of
 firm solidarity and of genuine equality in dealing with
 their own brothers.  They absolutely refuse to recognise
 that  any  one  among  their  own  brothers  or  among
 humanity has any special privileges and they do not
 cherish the idea that they themselves have any special
 privileges. To them such a thing is unthinkable and an
 insult.  They want to develop and elevate themselves
 but they know they must at the same time develop others,
 raise the positioi3 of the whole labouring class, and only
 thus can they elevate themselves.  They are unwilling
 to lag behind others as regards ideology, politics or work
 and they have a lofty aspiration to strive for progress,
 but they know they must respect, love and help those
 persons who are better qualified
 in such aspects.  They
 strive to learn from such persons without any jealousy.
 Y j usy.
 They show extreme concern for the painful and difficult
 situation of their own class and of the whole of the world's
 labouring people. le   The
 g p  p                 They are concerned about the struggle
 for the emancipation of labouring people everywhere and
 about their victories and defeats.  They realise that every
 victory or defeat of the labouring people  wherever it
 takes place, means their own victory or defeat, and more-
 75
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 over, they express very great sympathy and concern about
 such victories and defeats.
 They consider that in the struggle for the emancipa-
 tion of any labouring people or of all the oppressed people
 it would be criminal to adopt an attitude o
 udC of ind~~~'#'eLen...,
 or to gloat over other's misfortunes.  They .love their
 own comrades and brothers; they openly, frankly and
 sincerely point out the weaknesses and mistakes of their
 comrades and brothers.  (Indeed, this is a true expres-
 sion of love .  In matters of principle they never appease
 or compromise with their comrades or even encourage
 their mistakes and weaknesses (to do so would not. be
 an expression of love), but use every means to help them
 overcome and correct  such weaknesses and mistakes.
 They do not utilise or aggravate such weaknesses and
 mistakes to force their comrades into an unfortunate or
 even hopeless situation.
 In dealing with their
 own comrades and brothers,
 they `return good for evil.' If only the other comrades
 will correct their mistakes they will have not Y                the slightest
 desire for retaliation.  They are able  to require much
 from themselves and little from others.   They are strict
 with themselves but rather lenient towards other com-
 rades.  Nevertheless, they take a_firm and strict position
 in matters of principle and adopt a candid, upright and
 serious attitude.  They will not compromise on questions
 of principle.  They will not tolerate anyone who in any
 way harms the interests of the Party, nor will they allow
 anyone to insult them without reason.
 They are especial-
 ly contemptuous of anyone who lavishly praises, flatters
 78
 or adulates them in an unprincipled way.  They oppose
 all unprincipled struggle among their own comrades and
 at the same time keep themselves from being involved in
 unprincipled struggles.  They are not influenced or irritat-
 ed by those irresponsible and informal criticisms made
 behind their backs and will not on this account lose
 their own stand on matters of principle or their cool-
 headed and calm attitude.
 All this represents the ideology of the proletariat
 and should be reflected, developed and learnt by every
 Y     Y
 one of our Party members.  The entire lives of our great
 leaders, Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin represent the
 highest model and concrete embodiment of such ideology.
 All this represents the uprightness of humanity
 in the pre-
 sent society, and it is the Communist Party that manifests
 such uprightness.  We must promote and elevate such
 uprightness in order to overcome all viciousness.
 Fifthly, bureaucracy still exists in our Party and
 in various organisations.  I will speak again on this
 subject later on.  Among some comrades there still exist
 such weaknesses as narrow-mindedness and the minding
 of small matters without taking into consideration the
 overall situation, They do not have the
 Y                    great courage
 or . the far-sightedness of a
 Communist,
 ,              Blind to the
 bigger issues, they are very much interested in small
 matters under their nose.        They are not very  much
 interested in the vital problems and the highly important
 events of the Party and the revolution, but instead often
 concern themselves with trifles as small as a needle or
 77

 a piece of thread or with insignificant remarks.  Over such
 trifles they will seriously and endlessly argue with others
 and become  overwhelmed with  unrestrained emotion.
 They can also be easily bribed by others with small
 favours or gifts.  They have all the characteristics of
 r'.
 narrow-mindedness of the small producer in rural society.
 Also there are still certain individuals who seem to
 have no clear and definite standpoint.  To them, this may
 be all right and that may also be all right.  They play
 ball with both sides and try to please everybody.                                                                                        To
 his face they can get along very well with a person whom
 they hate.  They can speak well of you to your face,
 while speaking ill of you behind your back.   They may
 speak   ell of a certain person t             a
 to one man, and speak
 ill of the same person to another man.  `To show himself,
 when speaking, to be a respecter of persons and cir-
 cumstances,' to `tack with the wind,' and to lean without
 principle on the winning side-such are their characteris-
 tics.  Sometimes they are just fence-sitters watching to
 see which side is winning and going over to 'hat side.
 Such people who are neither `fish  flesh  nor fowl' but
 who are 'double-dealing'  creatures are not al
 together
 unknown in our ranks.  They display the characteristics
 of a broker.
 In addition, there are certain persons who simply
 cannot stand the temptations of the exploiting classes of
 the old society.  They begin to waver when they see
 around them the kaleidoscopic world, glittering gold and
 beautiful women.  As a result, they may commit crime,
 or may even betray the Part  a
 y and the revolution,
 78

 Furthermore,  the  impetuosity  and  inconsistency
 which characterise the petty-bourgeoisie, and the des-
 tructive character of the  lumpen-proletariat and the
 bankrupt peasantry are also often reflected in the ideology
 of some of the comrades in the Party. We have no need
 to go further with our list.
 To sum up,  apart from those who represent the
 Communist  ideology  of  the  great  and  resolute  pro-
 letariat, there still exist in our Party certain comrades
 who, to a greater or lesser degree, reflect various kinds
 of non-proletarian ideology and even the ideology of the
 declining exploiting classes. Such ideology is sometimes
 latent in the Party and only reveals itself in some small
 individual  daily  problems.  Sometimes  it  grows  and
 systematically exposes  itself in various problems of
 principle in the Party, in important political questions
 and in inner-Party struggles. Certain individual sections
 or links of the Party organisation may also be controlled
 or corroded by such erroneous ideology. When it develops
 to the highest degree, for instance, during the time when
 Chen Tu-hsiu, .Chang Kuo-tao and the like were in power
 in the Party such erroneous non-proletarian ideology even
 temporarily  controlled  the  major . part  or  the  most
 important  art of the Part
 p               y leadership.    But in normal
 times such ideology is overcome by correct proletarian
 ideology.  This  is  demonstrated  by  the  inner-Party
 ideological struggle.
 The same is also the case with certain Party members.
 Sometimes, their erroneous ideology lies dormant and
 ideology
 79
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 under control.  But at other times it may develop to the
 point of controlling their actions.  This is demonstrated
 b__   the contradictions  and  st_ru gbules                 the  two
 e                        ., between
 uy
 different ideologies possessed by the same individual.
 Our ideological cultivation means that we should
 consciously adopt the proletarian and Communist outlook
 ._
 on life and world outlook and have a correct  Qndersvand-
 ing of the relationship between individual development
 and the interests of the emancipation of the class, nation
 and mankind in order to overcome and eliminate all kinds
 of incorrect and non-proletarian ideologies.
 The Origin of the Various Erroneous
 Ideologies in the Party
 Comrades!  The Communist  Party represents the
 brightest and the most progressive side of contemporary
 human  society. It  is here that the best ideology of
 humanity-Marxism-Leninism--exists and develops.  Ga-
 thered together in the Communist Party are the world's
 most conscious, progressive, and sound persons with the
 highest sense of morality and righteousness.  They per-
 sistently fight against all evil influences and struggle for
 the bright future and for the final emancipation of human
 society.  The Chinese Communist Party is one of the best
 Communist Parties in the world.  It is powerfully armed
 with Marxist-Leninist theory, and, at the same time, it
 has inherited the finest traditions of the many progressive
 thinkers  and  prominent  men    who have  made  great
 achievements in past generations in China's history. It
 stands for the most progressive and the brightest side
 of Chinese society.   In its organisation are gathered
 together the most splendid Chinese men and women.  It
 -
 has carried on a protracted struggle against the old, evil
 influences and traditions of Chinese society and it has
 accumulated rich experiences and gone through many
 trials over a tong period of revolutionary struggle. All
 these are matters which we Communists can be proud of.

 we can assert, I, rrie can  assert,   with full 11    conf Bence   and on
 Furthermore,
 every authority, that we shall certainly achieve final
 victory, and final success.
 However, even so not everything in our organisation
 is perfect. Our organisation is not without defects or
 mistakes. Our ranks are not without unsound elements
 or even bad eggs.  And it is still not impossible for such
 unsound elements and bad eggs to do foul and harmful
 things. That is to say in our bright Party there are
 still things of darkness there is still a seamy side.  These
 are the things which I have previously enumerated.
 Once. a family has taken in marriage an ugly son-
 in-law or daughter-in-law, it will not be possible to
 keep him or her from meeting the guests.  With regard
 to the things of darkness, even if we try to adopt an
 attitude of `not washing our dirty linen in public,' it will
 be impossible.  The masses of people are in constant
 contact with our Party, our sympathisers will come to
 visit us and a vast number..- of people, young men and
 women who look up to us desire to come here (Yenan
 -Translator) 'to learn from us or to loin our Party. When
 they arrive here, apart from seeing all our progressive,.

 i
 bright, and beautiful things and family-members, they
 will meet our ugly son-in-law or daughter-in-law, who
 in the presence of many people, talks nonsense or makes
 a fool of himself or herself.  In such cases some of our
 guests and new Party members will wonder.  They will
 ask such question:  Isn't the Communist Party supposed
 to be the most just? Aren't Communists the best men and
 women?  Why are there still such ugly persons and bad
 things in the Communist Party?  Isn't this strange?
 Some young comrades, before they joined the Party,
 were very bitterly dissatisfied with existing society and
 felt that there was no way out and that only the Com-
 munist Party offered the brightest hope.  They thought
 that after they joined the Party everything would be
 satisfactory and hopeful.  But after they joined they
 began to feel that in the Party there were also certain
 mistakes, defects and things of darkness. Moreover, in
 fact, we cannot make them feel satisfied with everything
 (because what they find to be satisfactory may be more
 or less not in conformity with the interests of the Party
 and the revolution).  What they now actually feel does
 not exactly coincide with their former ideals.  Then they
 began to feel doubtful and puzzled and asked:   `Why are
 there also such things in the Communist Party?'  Before
 some of them came to Yenan and entered the Anti-
 Japanese University they thought that Yenan and the
 Anti-Japanese University must be as good as they had
 dreamed them to be, but after they had arrived and
 entered the University they found that not everything
 was
 satisfactory.  Then they again became puzzled, asking.
 82
 `Why are there still such unsatisfactory things at Yenan
 and in the Anti-Japanese University?'  Certain persons
 even became pessimistic and disappointed because they
 J
 could not find answers to these questions
 With reference to these questions, in addition to
 sharpening  our  vigilance  and  instructing  our                                                                                             Party
 members and cadres to pay serious attention to carefully
 treating and guiding our new Party members and those
 who are inclined to us, and not giving them an unfavour-
 able impression, it is necessary to give an explanation to
 our comrades inside and outside of our Party.
 Why are there still such bad things in the splendid
 organisation of our Party?  The reason I think, is ~    very
 simple.  It is that our Party is not a Party that has
 fallen from the heavens; it is a Party which has grown out
 of the existing Chinese society.  Although in general our
 Party members are relatively the best Chinese men and
 women, the vanguard of the Chinese proletariat, they
 come, however, from every stratum of Chinese society
 and are still living in this society which is replete with
 the influences of the exploiters--selfishness  intrigues
 bureaucracy and every kind of filthy thing.  Most of our
 best Party members are unlikely to be influenced by
 such things, but is it so strange that there should still
 be other Party members who to a greater or lesser extent
 bring into our Party, or reflect in our Party, some of the
 filthy things of society?  Is it anything strange that there
 are muddy stains on a person who crawls out of the
 mud and who constantly dabbles in the mud?  It is not
 83
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108/11: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 strange at all.  It is a matter of course.  It would be
 very strange indeed if there were absolutely no such
 filthy things in the Communist Party.  How could it be
 possible for such a filthy society to give birth to a Com-
 munist Part                              that is
 y        perfectly immune from filth?  It is
 utterly inconceivable.  It can be said that so long as
 there are still such filthy things, so long as there are
 still classes and the influences of the exploiting classes in
 society, there are bound to be such filthy things in the
 Communist Party to some extent.
 Therefore the Communist Party is confronted with
 the   task  of  carrying  on  the  revolution  and  it is
 necessary for Communist Party members to carry on
 self-cultivation and steeling. Because of this in addition
 to waging struggles against all dark and backward in-
 fluences and things in society we must carry on inner-
 Party struggle to oppose the wavering, unsteady elements
 who reflect in the Party all kinds of dark and backward
 things in society.  This constitutes the very basis of our
 inner-Party contradiction and inner-Party struggle.  In
 the course of the various struggles inside and outside of
 the Party we seek to remould society, to gradually rid
 it of the dark, backward things and at the same time to
 remould our Party and Party members, to solve inner-
 Party contradictions so as to develop our Party and
 Party members to a sound and firm level.
 Comrade Stalin said:
 84
 ..  the sources of contradiction within proletarian parties
 lie in two circumstances.
 What are these circumstances?
 FirstlY,  pressure  by  the  bourgeoisie  and  bourgeois
 ideology on the proletariat and its Party in the course of
 the class struggle-pressure which the least steadfast strata
 of the proletariat, and that means the least steadfast strata
 of the proletarian Party, not infrequently give way to.   It
 cannot be     considered that the proletariat is  completely
 isolated from society, that it stands outside society.   The
 proletariat is part of society, connected with its various strata
 by numerous ties.  But the Party is part of the proletariat.
 Therefore, the Party cannot be free of connections with, and
 the influence of, the various strata of bourgeois society. The
 pressure of the bourgeoisie and its ideology on the proletariat
 and its Party. finds expression in the fact that bourgeois
 ideas, morals, customs and moods not infrequently infiltrate
 into the proletariat and its Party through certain strata of the
 proletariat, connected in one way or another with bourgeois
 society.
 Secondly, the heterogeneity of the working class, the
 presence  of different strata within the working class.  I
 think that the proletariat, as a class, may be divided into
 three strata.
 One stratum is the basic mass of the proletariat, its core,
 its permanent part, it is that mass of `thoroughbred' pro-
 letarians; which has already long ago severed its ties with
 the capitalist class.  This stratum of the proletariat is the
 most dependable support of Marxism.
 The second stratum consists of those who only recently
 came from the non-proletarian classes, from the peasants, the
 middle classes, the intelligentsia.  These people who come
 from other classes who only recently joined the ranks of
 the proletariat, have brought with them into the working
 class  their  customs,  their  habits, their  hesitations,  their
 instability.  This stratum represents the most favourable

 breeding ground for all sorts of anarchistic, semi-anarchistic
 and `ultra-leftist' groupings.
 Finally, there is a third stratum:  the working class
 aristocracy, the elite of the working class, the best provided
 for section of the proletariat, with its tendency towards a
 compromise with the bourgeoisie, with its dominant tendency
 to adapt itself to the powers that be, with its striving `to
 become a  somebody'.  This  stratum represents the  best
 breeding ground for outspoken reformists and opportunists.
 Comrades!  This is the origin of various non-pro-
 letarian ideologies, errors, defects and filthy things which
 still exist in our splendid proletarian Party.  This is the
 origin of the various contradictions that still exist in the
 Party.
 The Attitude Towards Various Erroneous Ideologies
 In the Party and Inner-Party Struggle
 Because of the influence of the exploiting classes,
 because of the heterogeneity of the working class and of
 our Party, there arise among different Party members
 differences in ideology,  viewpoint,  custom,  habit  and
 mood; there  arise  among  different    Party     members
 differences of varying degree in their philosophy of life,
 their world outlook, and their concept of ethics; and
 there arise among different Party members differences
 in methods of looking at
 things and. ways of thinking
 with regard to various revolutionary problems.  Some
 look at thins in a correct objective manner, from the
 angle of their development and their inter-connection
 while others look at thins in an incorrect subjective
 manner, taking things to be in a state of stagnation and
 isolation.  Some only observe or exaggerate this aspect
 of things, while others only see or exaggerate that aspect
 of things; that is to say, they do not view problems
 as a
 w.ole in accordance with the laws of the development
 and relation of objective things  but view problems in
 a one-sided and subjective way; therefore. differences as
 to the method of activity are brought about among Party
 members and differing ideas, views and arguments arise
 and in this way inner-Party struggles are aroused.
 Such  differences  and  arguments  will  inevitably
 become all the sharper, eespecially at turning points
 of
 the revolution, in conditions of ever-intensifying revolu-
 tionary struggles and growing hardships and under the
 influence and pressure of the exploiting class and its
 ideology.  Therefore, the crux of the problem is not
 whether there are differences an ideology  ? and opinions
 in the Party-there are bound to be such differences
 .
 The point is how to solve the contradictions within the
 Party, how to get rid of these differences how to over-
 come the various erroneous non-proletarian ideologies in
 the Party.  Naturally,  it  is only through inner-Party
 struggle that we can solve these contradictions, clear
 away the differences and overcome the various erroneous
 ideologies. Just as Engels said:  `No one can at any
 time hide contradictions for long.  Contradictions must
 be solved b means of struggle.'
 Different kinds of people both inside and outside of
 the Party,  hold  different  kinds of views and  adopt
 different kinds of attitudes towards the various errors
 and defects and undesirable things in the Party.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 The first kind of attitude is:  To enjoy seeing the
 defects, errors and undesirable things in our Party and
 to gloat over them and by every means utilise and magnify
 them in order to undermine our Party (sometimes the
 method used is to oppose certain mistakes and to support
 the Party line in such a manner as to channel the mis-
 takes in another direction).  This is the attitude adopted
 by our enemies outside the Party and by the spies and
 trotskyites lurking within the Party.
 The second kind of attitude is:  To sympathise with,
 accept and learn from certain erroneous ideologies and
 bad examples in order to gratify certain personal ambi-
 tions and desires.  People with this attitude consider that
 the existence of certain defects and errors in the Party
 is to their advantage, therefore they themselves con-
 sciously or unconsciously promote the development of
 such defects and errors and make use of them.  This is
 the attitude adopted by opportunists and Party members
 People of one kind do not see or are
 unwilling to
 see the defects, errors, and undesirable things in the
 Party.  They are blindly optimistic and take i
 it for granted
 that everything is all right in
 the Party; therefore they
 relax their vigilance and slacken their struggle against
 the defects, errors and all the undesirable things.
 People of a second kind see nothing or almost nothing
 but errors, defects and undesirable things; +hA
 b   ~..y do not
 see the bright side of the Party.        They consider that
 nothing is good in the Part ? therefore the
 Y,         they become
 pessimistic, disappointed and lose their confidence in the
 future of the Party.  Or having seen such things, they
 become alarmed and regard such thins    `
 g as disastrous.'
 Both of these views are incorrect and one-sided.
 Our view is different from both.        On the one hand we
 know  that  our Party is the most    ro'c
 Y                 p gi, ssive,  most
 revolutionary political        of the Chine
 party             se proletariat.
 On the other hand we clearly realise that in our Party
 there are still various kinds of errors, defects and un-
 desirable things, both large and
 small.  At the same time
 we clearly understand the origin of these things, the
 method of gradually correcting them and eliminating
 them.  Accordingly, we must
 strengthen our. efforts and
 work and carry on the necessary struggle
 in order to
 advance our Party and the revolution.
 Just as
 the standpoints and views of various persons
 are different, so there
 are also different kinds of attitudes
 towards the undesirable things in our Party.
 of the most undesirable character.
 The third kind of attitude is:  To leave these errors,
 defects and undesirable things undisturbed and to let
 them take their own course.     People with this attitude
 try to take things easy and are unwilling to struggle
 against these things.  Or they fear inner-Party struggle
 and self-criticism and consider these as harmful and not
 beneficial to the Party.  Or they are apathetic and unwill-
 ing to recognise these phenomena or they adopt a perfunc-
 tory,  conciliatory  and                                                                                                                             eclectic attitude towards these
 phenomena. This is the attitude adopted by Party mem
 bers who have but a weak sense of duty towards the Party

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 and who are profoundly imbued with liberalism and who
 are guilty of bureaucracy.
 The fourth kind of attitude is:  To harbour violent
 hatred towards the errors, defects and persons in the
 Party    whose  ideology is   incorrect People  with  this
 attitude bluntly sever relations with such persons, attempt
 to purge them and expel them from the Party at one
 stroke.  But if they fail in this or if they themselves meet
 with rebuffs they give up and become disheartened and
 melancholy.     They  `mind  their  own   business,'  keep
 themselves aloof or stand far away from the Party.    This
 kind of  absolute  attitude  also  finds  expression  in  a
 mechanical understanding of inner-Party     struggle and
 self-criticism. They  think  that the     more bitter   the
 struggle among comrades in the Party the better; they
 raise every trifle to a so-called `level of principle'; they
 label the tiniest fault as political opportunism, etc., and
 abuse the organisational methods of the Party or even
 methods used in struggles outside the Party to punish
 comrades.  They do not carry on the inner-Party struggle
 in an appropriate and concrete manner in accordance
 with the objective requirements and the laws of develop-
 ment of objective things, but, on the contrary, they carry
 on the 'struggle' mechanically, subjectively, violently and
 unscrupulously.  They consider that inner-Party struggle
 must be carried 'on under any circumstances and the more
 frequent and the more bitter the struggle the better, with
 the result that they deliberately hunt for `targets for
 struggle,' deliberately create inner-Party struggle  and
 seek to promote the work of the Party by relying upon
 . by
 so
 such mechanical `struggle.'  This is the attitude adopted
 by Party members who do not understand the origin of
 the contradictions within the Party and who lack know-
 ledge of the methods of dealing ? with inner-Party differ-
 ences and who only mechanically understand inner-Party
 struggle.
 The fifth kind of attitude is the very attitude we
 should adopt, an attitude which is opposite to the four
 kinds previously mentioned.
 1.  We first of all recognise and make out which of
 the various phenomena ideologies, diverse opinions
 and
 views are correct, beneficial to the long-range interests
 of the Party and the revolution, and which of them are
 incorrect and detrimental to the long-range interests of
 the Party and the revolution.  Maybe both side
 s to the
 dispute are wrong but a third opinion and vie
 w may be
 right.  After sober analysis and consideration we decide
 our clear-cut attitude, and take up our stand on the cor-
 rect side.  We do not blindly follow or idolise anybody.
 2.  We study, promote, and develop all that is
 p            good
 and upright and uphold all the correct views and opinions
 in the Party.  We do not imitate the bad examples or
 allow ourselves $o be influenced by incorrect y   correct ideology,
 3.  We do not adopt a liberal attitude but carry ut  on
 an irreconcilable struggle against various ideoloaies and
 views which are wrong in principle and against all unde-
 sirable phenomena in the n t e Party in order to constantly
 try to overcome such mistakes and phenomena.  We do
 41
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108/11: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 not temporise or permit the development of these mistakes
 and phenomena to jeopardise the interests of the Party.
 Nor do we fear this kind of inner-Party struggle.
 4.  We do not,, however, adopt a mechanical, absolute
 attitude.  We  combine irreconcilability and clarity in
 principle with flexibility in the methods of struggle and
 a
 with the spirit of patient persuasion.  In the course of
 prolonged struggles, we seek to educate, criticise, steel
 and reform those comrades who possess erroneous ideo-
 logies but who are not incorrigible.  In a concrete and
 appropriate way we carry on ideological struggles in the
 Party which are essential to the various questions of
 principle at different stages but do not recklessly carry
 on struggle in the Party in a subjective, mechanical and
 fanatical manner.  Nor are we addicted to struggle.
 5.  By means of inner-Party struggle we consolidate
 the Party and enhance its discipline and prestige, and
 mete  out organisational penalties  to the  incorrigible
 elements or even expel them from the Party in order to
 ensure the soundness and consolidation of our Party. This
 is the attitude which all good and. mature Party members
 should adopt.
 Of the five previously-mentioned
 attitudes only the
 fifth is the correct Bolshevik attitude.  It is obvious that
 the first and second attitudes are incorrect.    It is not at
 all strange that our enemies should make use of all our
 errors and defects in order to undermine our Party.  In
 addition to constantly sharpening our vigilance we should
 on every occasion when defects and mistakes occur inside
 92
 the Party, reduce any opportunity which could possibly
 be utilised by the enemy.  This is the bouriden duty of
 every comrade who loves our Party.  If in the course of
 inner-Party struggle a Party member ignores this point
 or is only concerned with victory in the  immediate
 struggle  and his  own momentary gratification, or if he
 does iiot reject assia mice carom bad eieiiients, bui joins
 in with them, or if he utilises certain forces and help
 from outside the Party in order to attain a certain goal
 in inner Party struggle, he will commit an unforgivable
 political mistake and a gross violation Of Party discipline.
 Our Party members should reflect the correct ideology,
 learn from good examples and not from incorrect
 ideo-
 logies and bad examples in the Party.  They should
 fight
 against  such  incorrect  ideologies  and bad  examp1
 es.
 There are, however, still certain comrades in the Party
 who, apart from reflecting correct ideologies and follow-
 ing good examples sometimes more or less reflect certain
 incorrect ideologies and follow bad examples.   t se
 I     ems
 easy for certain comrades to learn to be bad but hard
 for them to learn to be good.  This deserves our - serious
 attention.
 These comrades, in the event of certain mistakes
 occurring in the Party, are apt to help to develon or
 magnity such mistakes either intentionally or uninten-
 tionally and in the course of inner-Party struggle Y     gg1e they
 often line up on the wrong side, or
 g          for certain reasons
 they join the winning side.  These comrades will scarcely
 make any progress, unless seriously prodded and steeled.

 It is, I think, quite clear to you students of the
 Institute of Marxism-Leninism that the comrades of the
 third kind who adopt a liberal and bureaucratic attitude
 towards  the various  errors,  defects  and undesirable
 phenomena are of course extremely wrong and entirely
 non-Bolshevik.   For in Party Construction which you
 have studied,  tlicie  is a whole chapter devoted to the
 necessity or self-criticism and ideological struggle in the
 Party. Lenin and Stalin have likewise on many occa-
 sions given clear and profound explanations on this point
 to which you may make reference, and the fourth and
 fifth chapters of the book On Political Parties, published
 by the Chinese. Publishing House, deal with this question
 at great length, therefore I need not go into details now.
 What I do want to point out, however, is that there are
 still not a few comrades in the Party who adopt this kind
 of attitude.  They have been very inadequate in carrying
 on self-criticism and particularly in self-criticism from
 the lower levels upwards, and in exposing various errors,
 defects, and undesirable phenomena in the Party in a
 responsible, formal, and sincere manner in order to cor-
 rect and eliminate them.  In this respect, we still need
 great improvement.  But there is quite a lot of irrespon-
 sible, informal and cowardly criticism and discontent,
 backbiting and gossiping in the Party about this or that
 person or concerning this or that matter.  These are two
 expressions of liberalism in the Party.  This shows that
 the political development and courage on the part of some
 comrades in the revolutionary struggle are still inade-
 quate and that the correct practice of inner-Party demo-
 cracy is also still inadequate.
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/08/11
 Certain comrades dare not dispense with face-saving,
 fear to give offence to others or to incur their animosity
 or counter-criticism.  They would rather leave the various
 errors and defects in the Party alone and adopt a perfunc-
 tory attitude of `muddling through' and `the less trouble
 the better' and yet they criticize others behind their backs.
 This is not beneficial but detrimental to the Party.  Such
 irresponsible criticism and talk may lead to unprincipled
 disputes and splits in the Party, and may offer opportuni-
 ties to spies lurking in the Party and bad elements to
 carry on disruptive activities in the Party.  Furthermore,
 the mistakes and defects in the Party will never be correct-
 ed  by means of such kind of irresponsible                                                                                                                               criticism.
 Therefore the Party rules adopted at the Sixth Plenary
 Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
 of China prohibit such irresponsible criticism and talk
 and promote inner-Party, responsible and formal self-
 criticism which is beneficial to the Party.
 Since  various errors, defects and incorrect, non-
 proletarian ideologies exist in the Party, each of these
 incorrect ideologies may at some time develop into a
 certain trend in the Party, give rise to differences in the
 Party over certain principles and affect the Party's unity
 in action. If under such conditions' we do not correctly
 carry on self-criticism in the Party and constantly expose
 and correct the various errors and defects, overcome all
 incorrect ideologies and conduct inner-Party struggle to
 overcome inner-Party differences, but instead adopt an
 eclectic attitude and `middle' line and try to muddle
 through-then, `we shall not be able to correctly educate
 CIA-RDP81 -01 043R0007001 00003-6
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 the Party, the proletariat, and the masses' (Stalin).  `We
 shall not be able to advance or develop'; `we shall no
 longer be proletarian revolutionaries and we shall be
 doomed to failure.'   (Lenin).
 Stalin said:
 The middle' line on questions of principle is a `line' that
 muddles up one's head, a `line' that covers up differences, a
 `line' of ideological degeneration of the Party, a `line' of
 ideological death of the Party.
 The policy of the `middle' line on questions of principle
 is not our policy.  The policy of the `middle' line on question
 of principle is the policy of a party that is declining and
 degenerating from day to day.  Such a policy cannot but
 lead to the transformation of such a party into an empty
 bureaucratic organ, functioning fruitlessly and detached from
 the working masses.  This road is not for us.
 Therefore..... the  overcoming  of  the  contradictions
 within  the  Party  by                means  of  struggle  is  the  law  of
 development of our Party. ...the All-Union Communist Party
 (Bolsheviks) grew and gained strength by overcoming the
 contradictions within the Party.
 Therefore,   it  is incorrect to adopt a liberal and
 bureaucratic attitude; self-criticism must be developed
 and inner-Party struggle carried on to oppose all undesir-
 able phenomena, and to overcome differences in the Party
 before it can be consolidated developed, and advanced.
 Liberalism is manifested in another phenomenon.
 When a particular dispute has broken out in the Party
 many comrades put aside their regular work and for
 days and nights engage in inconsequential discussions or
 96
 deliberately indulge in denouncing everything in  the
 in the course of such debates they weaken
 Party, and
 Party unity, disintegrate the solidarity of the cadres,
 weaken Party discipline, incapacitate the Party leader-
 ship, destroy Party prestige and convert militant Party
 organisations  and the  Party apparatus into  debating
 societies.  Cases like this have taken place more than
 once in the past in certain of our Party organisations.
 As Stalin says:  `This is not self-criticism but a scandal.'
 `This is slandering the working class.'  This is alien, anti-
 Bolshevik `self-criticism.'  It has nothing in common with
 the self-criticism we advocate.  The reason why we need
 self-criticism is not to destroy Party prestige, undermine
 Party            weaken Party leadership, but to promote
 discipline, Party Prestige consolidate Party discipline, and streng-
 then Party leadership.
 The  comrades  of the fourth kind who adopt an
 absolute attitude are also wrong.  This attitude is the
 opposite of liberalism - the  third attitude  mentioned
 above.   Those who adopt this attitude do not understand
 that the incorrect ideologies in the Party have a deep-
 rooted social origin and cannot be eliminated at one
 stroke.  All comrades in the Party, at different times,
 are more or less apt to reflect some incorrect ideology of
 society. Only  people  like  Marx  Engels>  Lenin  and
 Stalin, people so pure, so firm, and so correct, keen and
 profound in observing things can be 'perfectly free from
 the influence of these ideologies.  That is why Dr. Sun
 Yat-sen called Lenin `the sage of the revolution.' It . is
 inevitable that everyone of us will commit some mistakes
 87
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108/11: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010108111: CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 in our work.  If we do not tolerate and make allowances
 but absolutely reject and even eliminate all comrades who
 to some degree or other reflect non-proletarian ideologies
 of society and who commit some mistakes but who are
 not incorrigibly bad elements, then our Party cannot be
 built  up.  The  ultimate result  of such rejection  and
 elimination may lead to the eventual elimination from
 the Party of the very comrades who adopt this absolute
 attitude, because they are not `sages of the revolution'
 and they themselves cannot help committing mistakes.
 For example, in the past some comrades committed mis-
 takes  during  the  campaign  to  suppress  reactionary
 elements because they adopted this  absolute attitude.
 Comrades who adopt this attitude do not specifically
 understand  that  in  the course of the  struggle for
 the cause of Communism, the greatest and most difficult
 task is to transform mankind into selfless citizens of
 Communist society.    If they understand this point, if
 they understand that even mankind with all its weakness-
 es, can in the long course of struggle, be steeled, educated,
 and converted  into   highly  civilised  Communists,  why
 can they not educate and reform Party members who
 have joined the Party but who still retain to some degree
 or other the remnants of the ideology of the old society?
 Naturally, it needs long, patient education and steel-
 ing to reform and educate these Party members.                                        It is
 a difficult task.  However, i
 if we are reluctant to under-
 take this small, difficult task and shrink from it, how
 can we talk about changing the world and mankind.
 Since we have made. up our minds to undertake and not
 98
 to shrink from, the unpreceden.tedly arduous task                        of
 changing the world and mankind what- other arduous tasks
 in the world today can daunt us?  Party members who
 believe in the Communist philosophy of life and world
 outlook are dauntless and unafraid of any difficulties and
 hardships, and at the same time understand that the
 course of progress of world events is a tortuous one.  The
 comrades  who adopt an absolute attitude do not        yet
 .
 understand the arduous and tortuous nature of the cap se
 of Communism.  If they fear hardships  desire to travel
 a straight road to eliminate at one stroke all the undesir-
 able things, and immediately to leap into their ideal
 world, they will certainly run their heads against the
 wall.  After they have run their heads against the wall
 they will become pessimistic and disheartened, lose their
 confidence in the future of the cause of Communism, thus
 exposing the very substance of their non-proletarian ideo-
 logy.                                                                                                                            What a pity it is that there are still not a few
 comrades in our Party who more or less adopt such an
 attitude!
 The reason why inner-Party struggle is necessary
 is that differences over principles inside the Party are
 brought about in the course of the development of the
 Party and the struggle of the proletariat, ? at such times
 ,
 differences can be overcome and contradictions solved
 'only by a fight for on
 y y            one or the other principle, for one or
 the other goal of the struggle for one or the other method
 in the struggle leading to that goal.'
 .  No compromise will
 be of any avail. y          Inner-Party struggle is necessary not
 because we like to struggle or
 to argue.  That is to sa

 when questions have developed to the level of principle
 and cannot be solved by any means but struggle, we
 should unflinchingly carry 'on inner-Party struggle to
 solve them.  It does not mean that we have to conduct
 inner-Party struggle in a fussy and uncompromising way
 and with a long face, against all dissenting views con-
 cerning current policies and purely practical matters.
 Comrade Stalin said:
 We can and must reach all kinds of agreements with
 dissenters within the Party on questions of current policy, on
 questions of a purely practical character.
 When  opportunist  ideology  manifests  itself  and
 differences in principle take place in our Party, we must
 carry on struggle to oppose these erroneous principles
 and opportunism and overcome them; it does not mean
 that when there is no difference in principle, no oppor-
 tunism in the Party we subjectively and deliberately try
 to magnify some difference in opinion among the com-
 rades concerning certain purely practical matters and
 and  deliberate)
 take  it for  difference  in  principle,'                    Y
 `hunt' for certain comrades as `opportunists,' regarding
 them as `targets' in inner-Party struggle.  It does not
 mean that we think that the work of the Party, the
 development of the Party and the victory of the prole-
 tarian revolutionary struggle will be miraculously ex
 p                                                           -
 anded  simply by relying upon                                   intensifying the fire
 against such `targets.'  Of course, this is not conducting
 inner-Party struggle seriously but is simply making a
 mockery of the Party, and making child's play of inner-
 Party struggle, which is of an extremely serious nature.
 100
 44
 It is necessary to prod, publicly criticize or even
 mete out organisational penalties to certain comrades in
 the Party who, having committed mistakes in principle
 and displayed opportunist ideology, turn a deaf ear to
 persuasion,  ignore  Party  criticism   and  furthermore
 persist in their errors and become so headstrong and
 obstinate as to struggle against the policy of the Party
 or adopt a double-faced attitude.  But we should not
 attack or punish comrades who have committed mistakes
 if they do not persist in their mistakes and after dis-
 cussion and persuasion, are willing to correct their mis-
 takes and glue up their former points of view, or when
 they are calmly thinking over their mistakes or are dispas
 iscussing them with other comrades.. In carry-
 sionately d                                                 -
 ing on self-criticism and inner-Party struggle we do not
 mean that the grimmer the face the better nor do we mean
 that the more comrades we punish the better. The
 highest aim of self-criticism and inner-Party struggle is
 to effectively educate the Party, to educate the comrades
 who have committed mistakes, to correct errors and to
 consolidate the Party.  If this aim can be attained by
 means of peaceful discussion  Persuasion and criticism
 instead of pulling a long face engaging in heated discus-
 sion, punishing or attacking comrades-if this is possible,
 then of course, it is all the better.  However, during
 certain periods in the past we hardly ever heard in the
 .
 Party openly expressed views to the effect that such inner-
 Party peace and solidarity resulting from the absence of
 differences over principle were both desirable and essen-
 tial.                                                                                                                               According to some seemingly crazy people, inner-

 ciple and line and only by deliberately creating inner-
 Party struggle out of nothing can we be called 'Bolshe-
 viks.'  Of course people of this kind are not `Bolsheviks'
 at all but are almost incorrigible people and careerists
 usurping the name of `Bolshevik.'
 This is the reason why the four previously-mentioned
 attitudes are wrong.  This is the answer to the question
 as to what attitude we should adopt in dealing with the
 errors, defects and undesirable phenomena in the Party.
 As a matter of fact, it is through the struggle against the
 things of darkness inside and outside the Party that we
 seek to change the world and mankind, as well as our
 Party and ourselves.  Inner-Party struggle is the reflec
 tion of the class struggle outside the Party.  In the course
 of the class struggle outside the Party-the revolutionary
 mass struggle-the Party steels,  develops and consoli-
 dates itself and at the same time, in the course of the
 inner-Party struggle achieves solidarity and unity so as
 to be able to  lead the revolutionary mass  struggle
 systematically, correctly and effectively.
 Therefore, it is entirely wrong and favourable to the
 enemy to adopt a liberal attitude towards. the various
 mistakes,  defects  and  undesirable phenomena  in the
 Party, to try to deny differences over principle in the
 Party, to evade inner-Party struggle, to cover up inner
 Party contradictions and `muddle through,' because it is
 against the laws of development of the class struggle
 and against our fundamental standpoint of changing the
 world and mankind through struggle.
 102
 Therefore, it is also wrong to separate inner-Party
 struggle from the class struggle outside the Party-the
 revolutionary struggle of the broad masses-and to turn
 it into empty talk because the Party cannot steel, develop
 and consolidate itself if it divorces itself from the re-
 volutionary struggle of the broad masses.
 However, it is not right, either, to carry the matter
 to another extreme-to adopt an absolute attitude to-
 wards' the comrades who have defects and mistakes but
 are not entirely incorrigible, and to mechanically carry
 on  or even  subjectively  create,  inner-Party  struggle,
 because this will undermine the Party, afford opportuni-
 ties to the enemy to attack our Party and is , against the
 laws of development of the Party.   We should not break
 with the honest comrades in the Party the moment they
 have committed some mistakes but should seek to per-
 suade  educate,  and steel them in a considerate and
 sympathetic manner.   We  should not publicly attack
 them or expel them from the Party unless it is absolutely
 necessary.
 In spite of certain errors and defects, certain indivi-
 dual, isolated, bad phenomena that still exist in our Party
 we are fully confident that in the development of the
 working class movement and in the great revolutionary
 struggle of the masses, we cari and shall certainly elimin-
 ate these things.  The history of the past more than ten
 years' struggle of the Chinese Communist Party, its great
 progress in all respects, and the history of the development
 of the working class movement in the various countries
 of the world have thoroughly convinced us on this point.

 Inner-Party struggle is an indispensable and essen-
 tial component part of the revolutionary struggle of the
 Party.  Therefore our comrades should not only be steeled
 and cultivated in the course of the struggle outside the
 Party, but also be steeled and cultivated in the course of
 inner-Party struggle on two fronts.  However, not a few
 of our comrades still do not thoroughly realise this point
 and lack self-cultivation and steeling in this respect.
 This is manifested in many unprincipled struggles in the
 Party, and in the following examples: some of our com-
 rades especially those who have worked for a relatively
 long time in the army, never vacillated, complained or
 felt disheartened in the course of the struggle against
 the counter-revolution  no matter how cruel and hard
 the struggle was or how many attacks, wrongs, or in-
 justices they suffered.                                      But during inner-Party struggle
 they could hardly bear any criticism, attacks and in-
 justices, not even a single word.  Or they were suspi-
 cious and thought that what other people said alluded
 to them and on this account they would complain and
 become extremely disheartened. Comrades, we cannot
 but pay attention to such phenomena.
 We ought to say that they are in general very good
 comrades  because they resolutely fought against the
 counter-revolution and regarded the Party as their affec-
 tionate mother.  After having undergone  many hard
 battles against the counter-revolution and returned to
 the arms of their own great mother they expect to meet
 with encouragement, consolation and affection and not
 more attacks, criticism and injustices.  It is only natural
 that they should have such expectations.  However, what
 they have not taken into account or into full account is
 that since there are still various errors and defects in the Part  it is necessary to conduct inner-Party struggle in
 y
 comrade must take part.    It is inevitable
 which every
 in the course of inner-Party struggle for everybody to
 meet with correct or incorrect criticisms, attacks or even
 injustice and humiliation  This must be undergone by
 ~
 every comrade.  It is not because our Party is merciless
 but because this is an inevitable phenomenon of the Party
 in the course of the class struggle.  However, these com-
 rades fail to take this point into account, therefore the
 moment they come across such phenomena they are sur-
 prised rised and feel exceptionally miserable and disheartened
 In this respect, I think that our comrades should on
 unite with other comrades,
 the one hand, take care to
 treat them in a sincere and candid manner and should
 not hurt their feelings by casual malicious remarks, or
 throw sharp sarcastic remarks at them, and especially
 should not irresponsibly criticize comrades behind their
 backs.  With the exception of those who are most ob-
 stinate and who persist in their mistakes and do every
 kind of wrong thing in the Party, we should, in general,
 and criticize  in  their
 clearly and sincerely admonish
 in a considerate and helpful                  manner,
 presence,  and
 comrades who have committed mistakes.  This is what
 we, and especially our comparatively responsible com
 rades, should pay attention to.                                                                                                                                    We should bear in mind

 APPENDICES
 2.  Examine our own ideology, behaviour, correct all
 erroneous ideas and at the same time look at questions
 and other comrades on the basis of the Communist philo-
 so'phy of life, world outlook and firm Party standpoint.
 3.  Constantly adopt  an  appropriate attitude and
 method. in the struggle against various erroneous ideo-
 logies in the Party, especially those that affect the re-
 volutionary struggle of the time
 4.  Strictly control ourselves in ideology, speech and
 behaviour..: We should particularly control those political
 ideologies,  s,peeches. and  activities which  concern the
 ,
 revolutionary struggle at the time by taking a firm stand-
 point and by sticking to principle.  In addition it would
 be best to pay attention even to many `trifles' (private
 life, behaviour, etc.).  But as regards other comrades,
 except on questions 'of principle and important political
 questions, our restrictions imposed upon them should not
 be too severe.  We should not pry to find fault over
 `trivialities.'
 Comrades!  This is, in my opinion, what is meant by
 the fundamental ideological  cultivation of Communist
 Party members.
 THE CLASS CHARACTER OF MAN
 (Written in June, 1941)
 N A CLASS SOCIETY man's class character forms the
 very nature and substance of man.
 In a class society all human beings exist as human
 beings of a particular class.  Therefore, the social charac-
 ter of man is determined by his class status.  As the class
 status of one person is different from that of another, so
 is his social character.  In the past, Mencius, Kautze,
 Hsuntze* and others had argued `whether human nature
 was good or evil without ever achieving any result.  This
 was because they ,did not understand or deliberately
 wanted to cover up the class differences in the social
 '
 character of man.  In a class society men's ideas of good
 and evil are different.  What is regarded as good by the
 ? All the three were leading Confucian scholars of the latter part
 of Chou Dynasty (1122-255 B.C.). They held different views with regard
 to human nature.  Mencius was of the opinion that human nature
 was primarily good. Hsuntze regarded it as evil while Kautze thought
 that it was likely to change.

 exploiters is regarded as evil by the exploited, and vice
 versa.  Naturally, to discuss
 the question as to whether
 human nature is
 good or evil without taking into con-
 sideration the relationship of classes will get nowhere.
 Likewise, if we do not adopt the proletarian
 standpoint
 we cannot judge how good or how bad certain people
 are still less can we ' udge t
 ~      he party spirit of these people.
 The
 class character of
 man is determined b his class
 st                                                 Y
 atus. That is to say, if
 a given group of
 people have
 for a long time held the status of a given class, i.e., a
 given" position in social
 production, and have for
 a long
 time produced  lived and struggled in a given manner
 they will create their particular mode of life, and their
 particular interests  demands, psychologies  ideas -                                ,
 cus-
 toms,  viewpoints,  manners  and relations                                    with other
 groups of people and things, etc.  All these are different
 from, or contrary to, those created by other groups
 of
 people.  In this manner the particular characteristics of
 men, their particular class character, are formed.
 As men of different classes in society have different
 interests demands
 , ideas and customs so they have differ-
 ent ways of looking at and different policies in dealin
 with everyt                                               g
 hing in society and history--such as politics,
 economics culture, etc.  The ruling classes enact
 laws
 and systems in accordance with their interests, demands
 and viewpoints.  As a result, all political
 economic and
 cultural :systems insociety become tools
 of the ruling
 classes and all are permeated with a class character.
 110
 In a class society all ideas  utterances, behaviour,
 social systems and doctrines of
 men are permeated with
 a class character, representing the particular interests
 and demands of certain classes.    From the different de-
 mands, doctrines, ideas utterances
 and behaviour of men,
 we can find out their different class character.
 For example, natural agricultural economy and. the
 method of handicraft production
 are the basis of feudal
 society.  In such production the
 feudal lords are in a
 position to exploit the surplus labour
 , of the peasants.
 They do not work but rely upon .land rent and corvee
 as a means of living.  Therefore they want to get hold
 of more land and to possess it permanently.  They de-
 mand that the peasants pay more land rent
 and contribute
 more unpaid services, and recognise as justified
 their
 right of trampling on an
 and exploiting the peasants                     thus
 giving rise to their feudal sectionalism, swallowing-up
 of others, extravagance laziness, cruelty
 and social rank.
 Such are the characteristics of the feudal class.
 The method of machine production i
 in modern indus-
 try is the basis of capitalist society.
 In such production
 the bourgeoisie own the
 means of production and all the
 products with which to . exploit the surplus labour
 of the
 proletariat.  Their livelihood is dependent upon the sur-
 plus value created by the workers.  Such being the case,
 they want free buying and selling of commodities and
 of labour power, and free competition.
 They use econo-
 mic means to destroy their competitors and to create for
 themselves an economic and political _ monopoly. ? .,nop~.,,     They

 claim the inviolability of their private
 property and
 demand that the workers give their surplus labour in
 greater quantity (longer working hours and speed-up)
 and in better quality  better and. more experienced ~                             skill)
 for less pay.  They also want the workers to recognise
 as justified their right to become rich and to monopolise
 the wealth of society,            rise to heir
 giving       their competition,
 monopoly, extravagance and the centralised and mechani-
 cal character of their or anisation.  Such are g                   h ae the charac-
 teristics of the bourgeoisie.
 Take the case of the peasants.
 The peasants have
 for a long time been tied to the land
 and have been
 engaged in production in a form that is scattered, inde-
 pendent, simple, self-sufficing and with g        h little mutual co-
 operation.  Their way of life is simple
 Y and individualistic
 and they bear the burden of land rent d    t and unpaid services
 etc.  Thus, the  round is
 g          prepared for their lax ways,
 conservatism, narrow-mindedness backwardness,
 outlook
 as of private owners revolt against the feudal lords and
 their demand for political equality,
 etc.  Such are the
 characteristics of the peasantry.
 The proletariat are concentrated in big industries
 ,
 carrying on production with a minute division of labour
 all their actions are
 governed by machi:ies and mutual-
 depei,dence? they are wage-labourers
 who sell. their labour
 power and who do not  ;issess an
 P       any means of production;
 they rely on wages
 as a means of livelihood and their
 basic inter^
 tests do not conflict with those
 of other toilers.
 Hence the  round '
 ground is prepared for their great solidarity,
 112
 mutual co-operation, sense of organisation and discipline,
 progressive outlook and demand for public ownership of
 property, revolt against all exploiters, militancy, tenacity,
 are the characteristics of the proletariat.
 etc.  Such
 All exploiting classes deceive and oppress the exploit-
 ed . and fight among themselves . for the surplus products
 or surplus value of the exploited, thus giving rise to their
 deceitfulness, oppression of man and mutual plundering.
 Many wars in history were caused by the exploiting class-
 es fighting among themselves over the seizure and division
 of the surplus products and surplus value produced by
 the exploited.
 A feature common to all exploiters is that they build
 their happiness upon the sufferings of other  people.
 Sacrificing the happiness of all mankind or the great
 majority of the people, subjecting them to hunger, cold
 and humiliation in order to provide special privileges
 and special enjoyment for an individual or for a small
 number of people-such is the foundation of the `noble
 character' `greatness' and 'respectability' and moral basis
 of all exploiters.
 The reverse is the case with the proletariat and the
 Communists.  They want to build their happiness upon
 the basis of sharing their happiness with all others.  In
 the struggle for the emancipation of the broad masses
 of the working people and of all mankind, they seek
 to emancipate themselves and eliminate the special pri-
 vileges of the small number of people.  Such is th foun-

 dation of the noble character, greatness, respectability of
 the Communists and the foundation of Communist ethics.
 Such are the various class characteristics of men in
 a class society.  These class characteristics are gradually
 formed as a result of the specific position of men who
 engage for a long time in production their specific rela-
 tions of production and specific way of life.  They become
 a kind  of nature of men.  This nature is social in
 character.
 Party spirit is the highest crystallisation of such
 class characteristics of men.  Therefore men possess party
 spirit of various kinds:  The party spirit of the feudal
 class, the bourgeoisie, the proletariat etc.
 The Party spirit of a Communist is the highest cr Y
 -
 staLisation ' of the class character, the substance and
 the
 interests of the proletariat.  The steeling and cultivation
 of a Communist in the Party spirit is the remoulding of
 his substance.
 The Communist Party should develop the many great
 and progressive characteristics of the  r letari p o     at tothe
 highest level.  Every Communist should remould himself
 in accordance with these characteristics and equip him-
 self with these excellent characteristics
 This is the re-
 moulding of substance.  All Party members who do not
 come from the ranks of the industrial
 workers possess
 non-proletarian characteristics and therefore need all the
 more to be remoulded.

 the  common character of mankind,  namely common
 human nature, will be formed.  This represents the entire
 process of the remoulding of the substance of mankind.
 However, in the history of the world only the Com-

 and class character as well as those of all other people

 their party spirit and class character.  Because of their
 illusions and ignorance the petty-bourgeoisie accept this
 fallacy of 'super-party,' `super-class.'
 The petty-bourgeoisie is characterised by its indul-
 gence in illusions and by its fear of serious practice and
 struggle.

 SPEECH BY M. A. SiJSLOV
 Member of the presidium of the central committee of the Communist
 Party of the Soviet Union.
 16 February
 C OMRADES, in his report Comrade Khrushchov gave a clear, profound
 and comprehensive analysis of our party's activities in the period
 under review. He surveyed its outstanding successes, achieved under              I
 the leadership of the central committee, and formulated its tasks in the         j
 effort for the continued advance of communism.
 The results of the central committee's activities are there for all to see.
 And in assessing these results our congress, the whole of our party, and
 all the men and women of the Soviet Union, have every reason to approve
 them with a feeling of the deepest pride and satisfaction.
 The central committee proved itself equal to the gigantic tasks with
 which it had to contend in the period between the 19th and 20th Congresses.
 Its general line, both in home and foreign affairs, has been a correct and
 genuinely Leninist line.
 For Lenin taught us that the party's policy can be successful only if it
 takes into consideration the requirements of the situation, only if the party
 is always in close contact with the realities of life. And if we examine the
 period between the congresses in this light, we can safely say that throughout
 these years the party, headed by its central committee, has been especially
 close to realities, to the people, has been especially far-seeing in judging the
 situation at home and abroad, has correctly sized up the requirements of
 that situation, displaying a creative approach to the solution of both
 economic and political problems.
 The central committee's report fully reflects the creative, militant spirit
 which has been characteristic of our party's work since the 19th Congress,
 and that supreme degree of initiative and activity which is characteristic of
 the work of our central committee in marshalling the forces of the party
 and the people for the implementation of our political line.
 The report sums up the impressive results of socialist construction both
 in this country and in the people's democracies, the results of the struggle
 waged by the progressive forces of the world for the easing of international
 tension, national independence and the democratic rights of the people. for
 lasting peace and universal security. Our people. and progressive people
 f
 throughout the world, will derive from facts and figures cited in the report,
 and from the theoretical propositions it puts forward and the political
 conclusions it dra:vs. fresh faith in the ultimate triumph of peace, democracy
 and socialum.
 However, at the same time, the central committee's report, in complete
 conformity with the Leninist tradition, does not seek to conceal from the
 parry and the people the shortcomings and defects in our work and the
 problems that still await a solution. This shows that our party is not

 prepared to rest content with its achievements to date, and is setting new
 ,
 and still bigger tasks. A critical analysis of the work done is an indispensable
 condition of Bolshevik leadership. For only in this way can we avoid stag-
 nation and stimulate a constant advance to what is new, better and pro-
 gressive. We were taught that by the great Lenin.
 "The important thing," he said, "is not to rest content with the ability
 acquired from past experience, but always to move ahead, always to seek
 for more, always to  go  from easier tasks to more difficult ones. Without
 this, there can be no progress in general, and no progress in socialist con-
 struation'' (lVorks, Russian edition, Vol. 23, p. 172).
 The Struggle for Lasting Peace and Socialism
 C 0MRADES      the party's intense activity in the sphere of foreign policy
 during the period under review has been based on a profound under-
 standing of the distinctive features of the present international situation
 and of the tasks that confront the progressive forces of mankind. On every
 single international problem that is agitating the minds of the peoples, the
 Soviet Union has stated its position and has contributed in a very large
 measure towards a solution.
 In this sphere our party has been an active, guiding factor, constantly
 endeavouring to find practical and concrete solutions for all the problems
 on which the fate of peace depends. And as a result of this active peace
 policy of the Soviet Union and the joint actions of all the peaceloving
 nations considerable progress has been attained in the settlement of many
 issues. On other issues, the Soviet proposals are definitely the most realistic
 and constructive, and if no settlement of these issues has so far been
 achieved, that is not our fault.
 The implementation of Soviet foreign policy, formulated by our party,
 has always been strictly in keeping ing with principles , ; but at the same time
 it has been highly flexible. While resolutely repelling every attempt at dicta-
 tion by l certain powers, the Soviet Union has always shown its readiness to
 reach agreement, provided it is based on mutual respect for one another's
 ..        ,
 interests.
 The active efforts of the Soviet Union and other peaceloving nations
 have culminated in important results. First, there has been a definite measure
 of relaxation in the international tension that has existed for many years.
 Second. the forces of peace, democracy and socialism have considerably
 strengthened their positions. The international prestige and influence of the
 Soviet Union and of the entire socialist camp has increased substantially.
 On the other hand, the position of the imperialist camp has been considerably
 weakened. That is admitted, albeit reluctantly, even by such men as Mr.
 Acheson, aformer U.S. Secretary of Stute. The Washington Post and Times-
 Herald recently quoted him as saving that "if we look around us we will
 be hard put to find any area in which the events of the past few years have
 not moved to our disadvantage".'
 The cause of peace has gained added strength in this past period through
 ~                ..
 the extension of friendly contacts and co-operation between the Soviet
 Union and the peac     ~ eloving nations of Asia. And the peace forces have
 grown in strength and scope in the capitalist countries as well. Evidence
 ,.             ,.
 of this is provided, for instance, by the recent French elections, in which the
 parties of the left considerably extended and consolidated their position,
 both among the population generally and in parliament.
 But, of course, it would be wrong to rest content with these results.
 Much more remains to be done to convert the present measure of relaxation
 of international tension into lasting peace. The people's struggle for peace
 can and must be raised to a higher plane, particularly in connection with
 the attempt now being made by certain elements in the West to revive the
 "cold war".
 As for the Soviet Union, it will continue to be guided by Lenin's thesis
 that the socialist and capitalist systems can co-exist in peace. And it will
 continue its tireless efforts for the further relaxation of international tension
 and for the strengthening of peace, for this is completely in accordance with
 the interests of our peoples and with the interests of socialism.
 The discussion at this congress on basic questions of internal and inter-
 national development brings out with much greater clarity the meaning of
 our present-day struggle and the place it holds in history. The congress
 enables us to gain a deeper understanding of the trend of development in
 this age of momentous changes in the life of all nations, an age in which
 the imperialist system is collapsing and the world system of socialism is
 taking shape.
 Such fundamental questions of contemporary international development
 as the peaceful co-existence of the two systems, the possibility of preventing
 war in our age, the forms which the transition to socialism will take in
 different countries, and our attitude toward Social-Democratic parties, posed
 in Comrade Khrushchov's report, are of immense importance.
 The treatment of these questions in Comrade Khrushchov's report pro-
 vides a concrete example of the creative application and development of the
 great teachings of Marxism-Leninism. Comrade Khrushchov has given
 convincing answers to questions uppermost in the minds of people every-
 where-answers based on a Marxist analysis of the present international
 situation and of the epoch-making changes that have taken place since the
 war, and on a study of the new experience accumulated by our own party,
 the fraternal Communist Parties and the world workers' movement.
 Comrade Khrushchov has demonstrated that, at the present state of
 history, the question of whether war is inevitable must be treated differently
 from the way it was treated before the First and Second World Wars. For
 today the correlation of forces on the world scene has changed radically in
 favour of the forces of peace, and against the forces of war. Certainly, inas-
 much as imperialism still exists, there will also exist the economic basis that breeds wars, and for that reason the danger of the arch-reactionary
 monopoly interests precipitating fresh war gambles, particularly against
 socialist countries, is by no means eliminated. Consequently, there must be
 no complacency on this subject, no let-up of attention where the further
 strengthening of our country's defensive might is concerned. But there is
 now no fatal inevitability about war. For today, in the new historical con-
 ditions, there are powerful forces disposing of effective means for preventing
 the imperialists from unleashing war and-should they try to unleash it-
 for crushing the aggressors and ending the war, and with it the system of
 capitalism-a system which not only dooms the vast majority of the popu-

 lation  the workers  to cruel exploitation, virtual disfranchisement, mal-
 nutrition and poverty, but also to periodical bloodbaths.
 The imperialist rulers cannot but take these new historical conditions
 into account. Yet it is self-evident that the prevention of war and aggression
 is not an automatic process. War can be prevented only through a resolute
 struggle for peace in which all the peace forces act in a united and vigorous
 off the menace of war and aggression, and display vigilance
 way to wand
 with regard to the fomentors of war, eexpose their designs in good time and
 keep the peoples on the alert and ready for action.
 The knowledge that in this age war is no longer fatally inevitable, is no
 longer unavoidable, will undoubtedly stimulate further expansion of the
 peace movement and will be a source of inspiration to every peacelover.
 Of no less significance is the thesis expounded in Comrade Khrushchov's
 report on the variety of forms which the transition to socialism will assume
 in different countries.
 The epoch-making changes in the international situation have produced
 more favourable conditions not only for the peace effort but also for the
 struggle for socialism, for the transition of non-socialist countries to
 socialism, facilitating a greater variety in the forms this transition will take
 in different countries.
 The emergence and development of the socialist system in a whole number
 of countries has fully confirmed Lenin's brilliant forecast that, though the
 principal and basic features of the advance to socialism will be common
 and identical, the actual transition to socialism will not be the same in all
 countries, and each nation will make its own distinctive contribution in
 one or another form of democracy, one or another variety of proletarian
 dictatorship, one or another rate at which socialist transformations will be
 effected in the various aspects of social life.
 The experience of countries where the socialist system has already been
 established has confirmed that the transition to socialism requires that
 political leadership of the state be in the hands of the working class headed
 by its vanguard. And it is recognition of this basic and decisive condition
 for the transition to socialism that constitutes the principal difference
 between revolutionary Marxists and reformists. Working class political
 leadership of the state is essential in order-within a shorter or longer
 period, depending on concrete conditions-to deprive the capitalist class
 of the means of production and convert them into public property, in order
 successful resistance to possible attempts by the overthrown
 to organise
 to restore their rule, and in order to organise socialist
 exploiting classes
 construction.
 The march of events has likewise confirmed that in each of the socialist
 countries, though the basic features of their development have been the
 there is fraternal and mutual assistance and utilisation
 same, and though
 of experience. and notably the assistance and experience of the Soviet Union,
 there has also been much that has been constructively new and unique in
 the way she working class has won a decisive part in the administration of
 the state, and in the subsequent organisation of socialist construction.
 The question naturally arises: What about the future? Will there be
 new forms of transition to socialism? That question is of cardinal importance.
 For the people's urge to socialism is irresistible, the power of attraction of
 socialist ideas increases from day to day, and the process will be accelerated.
 by the continued achievements of socialism in this country, in China and
 all the people's democracies. Progressive minds in many countries are, in
 this situation, giving thought to what paths their own peoples will follow in
 the change-over to socialism.
 Comrade Khrushchov has given an absolutely clear, Marxist reply to
 that all-important question. It is quite probable that the transition to
 socialism in capitalist countries will produce a great multiplicity of forms.
 This will be an expression of the more favourable general situation, and of
 the concrete specific features pertaining in each country.
 It would be wrong, however, to assert that under all circumstances the
 transition to socialism will inevitably be attended by civil war. In this respect
 very much depends on the relation of forces within the given country and
 on the international scene, on the degree of organisation and political
 understanding of the revolutionary classes, and on the strength of the resist-
 ance offered by the reactionary classes. When the proletariat of Russia
 directed the revolution in this country, it faced a united front of the
 imperialist powers. Today the progressive forces in other countries have a
 much more favourable prospect before them, for new conditions have taken
 shape in the capitalist world. The political struggle there centres around
 such issues as the defence of peace, the democratic freedoms and national
 independence. That being so, the working class and its political parties
 have every opportunity of uniting, on the basis of a common democratic
 platform, the overwhelming majority of the nation-the peasantry, the lower
 middle class, intellectuals, and even the patriotically minded sections of the
 bourgeoisie. This, obviously, will make the victory of the working class
 easier.
 However, even in these conditions, in a number of capitalist countries, in
 those where the reactionary forces and the military and police machine are
 especially powerful, the transition to socialism will be attended by frenzied
 resistance from the exploiting classes, and, consequently, by sharp revolu-
 tionary struggle on the part of the working class. On the other hand, in
 those capitalist countries where the reactionary forces and the military and
 police machine are less powerful, the possibility of a peaceful course of the
 revolution and resultant transition to socialism is not to be ruled out. In
 particular, the possibility is not to be ruled out of the working class peace-
 fully coming to power through a parliamentary majority and the conversion of parliament into a genuine people's assembly. Such a parliament, relying
 on the support of the mass revolutionary movement of the proletariat, the
 working peasantry and all progressive sections of the population, would be
 able to break the resistance of the reactionary forces and carry out the
 socialist transformation of society.
 The enemies of communism depict Communists as confirmed believers in
 armed insurrection, violence and civil war under all circumstances. That is
 slanderous nonsense, an attempt to smear the Communists, and the working
 class which they represent. It stands to reason that the Communists and
 the working class prefer the least painful forms of transition from one social
 system to another. But the forms of this transition, as Comrade Khrushchov
 has demonstrated here, depend on concrete historical conditions. Moreover,
 the application of more peaceful or more violent methods depends not so

 much on the working class as on the degree and form of resistance offered
 by the exploiting classes, which do not want voluntarily to relinquish their
 wealth> political power and other privileges.
 The central committee's report sets forth the principles governing our
 party's attitude to Social-Democratic parties in the present stage.
 No one will deny that the cleavage in the international labour movement,
 at a time when the energies of the peoples should be united to combat the
 war danger, is doubly impermissible. The movement is faced with problems
 of overwhelming importance, and on these we can find common ground
 j                      ~~    ,.
 with the Social Democrats. It should be possible, therefore, to establish
 working contact closer relations and co-operation on these problems. Such a
 possibility arises above all, from the fact that, in the present situation, the
 paramount issues confronting the labour movement are the defence of
 peace, national freedom and democracy. A leftward swing of the masses
 is to be observed in many capitalist countries. Peaceloving sentiments are
 strong among the vast majority of the rank and file of the Socialist Parties,
 Christian trade unions and other organisations.
 It is to be hoped that the idea of unity will steadily gain support among
 the various sections of the working class and will find expression in prac-
 tical action. But this will not happen of itself, spontaneously. It will depend
 largely on us Communists, on our efforts to attain this goal.
 It would be hard to overestimate the importance of the theoretical pro-
 positions on pressing international problems set forth in the central com-
 mittee's report. They will go a very long way towards consolidating the forces
 of progress; they will help all progressive people who are working to promote
 peace and replace the obsolete capitalist system by a new, progressive social
 system which will bring the peoples liberation from exploitation and war,
 from social and national oppression in whatever shape or form.
 Party Organisational Work Must be Raised to the Level Demanded by the
 Organisational
 New Tasks
 C oMRAOLs  in the period under review the party dealt with questions
 relating to the country's internal development with no less vigour and
 initiative. This activity was based on a clear understanding of the pressing
 requirements for the further development of the country.
 The party boldly laid bare shortcomings in the various fields of economic,
 government and party work. At a number of plenary meetings of the central
 committee it worked out a comprehensive programme for the rapid promo-
 tion of agriculture and improvement in the operation of industry. It called
 on the working people to make new efforts to reorganise the work of the
 collective farms machine and tractor stations, state farms and industrial
 enterprises and carried out a tremendous amount of organisational activity.
 One can safely say that the great economic undertakings now under way
 in our country are the biggest the party has embarked on since the period
 of industrialisation and collectivisation. The fact that in two years we were
 able to increase the crop area in our country by more than 30 million
 hectares'-the equivalent of the crop area of a number of European countries
 taken together-shows that our party is today equal to tasks of the greatest
 magnitude.
 1 Nearly 75 million acres.  I hectare = 2.47 acres.
 8
 The tremendous work done by the party is bearing fruit. In the field of
 agriculture the first big step has been taken in the matter of increasing the
 production of grain and industrial crops and in developing livestock breeding,
 and the conditions have been created for rapidly increasing, within the next
 few years, the output of agricultural produce on a scale commensurate
 with the country's growing requirements. The fulfilment of the Fifth Five-
 Year Plan in four years and four months in industry shows what tremendous
 potentialities are being revealed in this sphere of our national economy
 as well.
 Basing ourselves on our accomplishments, we can now put forward new
 and gigantic tasks. We are in a position to develop at a rapid pace not only
 heavy industry, as the foundation of the entire national economy, but also
 the production of consumer goods, to increase public wealth considerably
 and on this basis substantially to improve the wellbeing of the people.
 These are the tasks set forth in the draft directives of the congress on the
 Sixth Five-Year Plan. The fulfilment of this plan will mean new and major
 successes in the socialist economy, a new and big step forward in creating
 an abundance of consumer goods in building communism in our country.
 Comrades  the Soviet people will welcome with great enthusiasm and
 redoubled efforts in production the measures outlined by the central com-
 mittee of the party for a further improvement under the Sixth Five-Year
 Plan of working and living conditions of which Comrade Khrushchov spoke
 here: the introduction in the course of the Sixth Five-Year Plan of a seven-
 hour day for all factory, office and other workers, and a six-hour day for
 the basic underground trades in the coal and ore-mining industries, and for
 young people, without any reduction of wages; the reduction of the working
 day on Saturdays and on the eve of holidays by two hours in the near
 ~
 future ? wage increases for lower-paid categories of workers and other em-
 ployees ees ? readjustment of pensions; a rapid expansion of housing construction
 (doubling the figure under the Fifth Five-Year Plan), and improvement of
 canteens and other establishments serving the public. All these measures
 will raise the wellbeing of Soviet people to a higher level. The party has
 thought of everyone : working people, the youth, who are our hope for the
 future. veteran workers women children, of each individual, and this is
 as it should be in a socialist society.
 The measures projected are arousing widespread comment abroad. All
 right-minded people are as pleased about them as we are. But there are also
 those who do not like them. The publication of the new Soviet Five-Year
 Plan has gone against the grain with certain elements. These elements no
 longer doubt that this Soviet Five-Year Plan, too, will be carried out. Every-
 one now admits that. They y are afraid of something else. This was frankly
 put recently by Judge W. Douglas, of the United States Supreme Court.
 "If Russia" he wrote "can get peace even for a decade, she can bring
 about a great increase in her standard of living. By that very act, she can
 create tremendous pressure on Asia and on Europe too.... A smiling,
 peaceful  prosperous  Russia  presents  a  most  difficult  international
 problem...."'
 Mr. Douglas is obviously made uneasy by the prospect of peaceful
 economic competition between the two social systems, and we have no

 intention of reassuring him. It is enough only to point out that a peaceful,
 prosperous Russia by no means presents a "most difficult international
 problem" for ordinary working people throughout the world, for they
 rightly regard the successes of the working people of the Soviet Union as
 victories of the great cause of peace, democracy and socialism.
 The Sixth Five-Year Plan marks an important stage in the peaceful
 economic competition between the two systems. A specific feature of this
 stage is the fact that the Soviet Union now enjoys all the necessary pre-
 requisites for accomplishing, within a historically brief space of time, the
 basic economic task of the U.S.S.R.-to catch up with and surpass the most
 highly developed capitalist countries in production per head of the
 population.
 In order to carry out this task we must see to it that the entire national
 economy is raised to a new and higher technical level, and substantially
 increase the productivity of labour. This is now the main requirement in
 order to ensure for socialism the first place in the competition with
 capitalism. Hence the economic aspects of production assume greater
 importance than ever.
 Economic management, the work of the Ministries and heads of enter-
 prises, collective farms, machine and tractor stations, and state farms must
 be raised to a higher level.
 In these conditions specific demands are presented also to the party
 organisations.
 Our party came to its 20th Congress united and monolithic as never
 before. The party's correct political line and the inexhaustible energy it
 puts into its work for the good of the working people have rallied the entire
 Soviet . people around it as never before, and strengthened still further the
 alliance between the working class and the peasantry and the great,
 indestructible friendship of the peoples of our country.
 Ideological and organisational unity of the party is the basic guarantee
 of its strength and the source of all its successes. Only because of the unity
 of its ranks has the Communist Party been able to deal successfully with
 the problems of both foreign and home policy, and to direct economic and
 cultural development.
 The restoration of the standards of party life and principles of party
 leadership worked out by Lenin> which were often violated before the
 19th Party Congress, has done much to strengthen the unity of the party
 and enhance its activity, initiative and militancy.
 The theory and practice of the cult of the individual which, though alien
 to the spirit of Marxism-Leninism, was current before the 19th Congress
 did considerable harm in the fields of both organisational and ideological
 party work. They tended to minimise the role of the masses and the party,
 to belittle collective leadership, to undermine inner-party democracy, to
 suppress the activity of party members and their initiative and incentive, to
 lead to lack of COCI i Ol  irresponsibility and even arbitrariness in the work
 of individuals, to prevent the development of criticism and self-criticism, and
 to give rise to one-sided and sometimes even erroneous solutions of problems.
 Re-establishment of the Leninist principle of collective leadership means
 re-establishment of the very foundations on which the party edifice rests,
 for our party is a living and self-acting organisation. Collective leadership,
 10
 V
 the principle that all party bodies are elected and accountable, criticism and
 self-criticism-these are all key conditions for stimulating initiative and the
 activity of party members, disclosing mistakes and shortcomings and devising
 ways and means of rectifying them.
 That the principle of collective leadership at all levels, from the central
 committee to basic party units, is now being effectively re-established, is
 borne out by the increased volume of criticism and self-criticism, by really
 collective discussion and decisions on all major problems in party bodies.
 It can be said without the slightest doubt that the principle of collective
 leadership has been fully re-established in the central committee. The decision
 on all major questions rests with the plenum of the central committee, which
 meets regularly and which represents a broad, collectively functioning party
 centre that maintains the closest contact with the vital sectors of communist
 construction. The collective experience of the central committee, based as
 it is on Marxism-Leninism, guarantees correct leadership of the party and
 the country and the indestructible unity of the party ranks.
 The cult of the individual, both in theory and practice, must be com-
 pletely overcome, and party committees must in all their work be guided
 unswervingly by the principle of collective leadership. Its significance must
 be fully understood and appreciated by every party functionary for it is a
 most important condition for party unity, for working out correct policies
 and successfully implementing them. It is a condition, also, for the proper
 training of cadres, and for improvement in every aspect of party work.
 The unity, solidity and effectiveness of the party depend largely on the
 composition of its membership.
 The party does not accept everyone who wishes to join its ranks. It takes
 into its midst the most forward-looking and active men and women and
 regulates the admittance of new members in accordance with the tasks it.
 has to solve at any given stage. In the years of industrialisation and col-
 lectivisation of agriculture, the party admitted mainly workers and peasants
 to membership. During the war preference was given to the men at the
 battle-fronts. I need hardly prove that today, when our goal is a steep rise
 in the output of material values, it is only reasonable to lay emphasis on
 priority ? acceptance of the men and women who produce these material
 values-the workers and collective farmers.
 What is the position with regard to recruitment? It should be observed
 that in the past two years the proportion of workers and collective farmers
 among new members has increased, as compared with earlier years.
 Yet in many party organisations the proportion of workers and collective
 farmers among newly admitted members is very small. And what is more,
 we often find that the proportion varies considerably in party organisations
 working under nearly the same conditions. The amount of industry in the
 Sverdlovsk and Novosibirsk regions is practically the same. However, in
 the Sverdlovsk organisation, the proportion of workers among new recruits
 last year was 47.2 per cent, and in Novosibirsk 32.2 per cent. In the Omsk
 region collective farmers made up 31.7 per cent of the new members, whereas
 in Stalingrad region the figure was only 11.4 per cent. What is the explanation
 for the proportion of workers in Novosibirsk being lower than in Sverdlovsk,
 and for the lower proportion of collective farmers in Stalingrad as corn-
 pared with Omsk? The only explanation is that the Novosibirsk and Stalin-

 grad regional pasty organisations have not paid sufficient attention to this
 matter. Unfortunately, this also applies to a number of other party
 organisations.
 It should be borne in mind that the success of any undertaking depends
 to a large extent on the composition of the party organisation. And party
 organisations must be more exacting in regulating the admission of new
 members and must radically increase the proportion of workers and
 collective farmers among new recruits.
 There is no need, of course, to emphasise the importance of our organisa-
 tional work, or to stress that it is a prime factor in all our activities and in
 the accomplishment of the impressive economic tasks outlined in the Sixth
 Five-Year Plan. That is why the need to improve the quality of leadership,
 notably at district level, is now so imperative.
 In his report, Comrade Khrushchov revealed the serious shortcomings in
 the functioning of local party committees: an inclination towards grandilo-
 quent declarations, armchair leadership, management without a proper
 study of economic problems, inability to organise the masses to eliminate
 shortcomings, overcome difficulties and apply the experience of front-rank
 workers and the achievements of science in industry and agriculture.
 Regional,  territorial, town and district committees have somewhat
 improved their work following the central committee's demand that an
 end be put to bureaucratic methods of leadership. There are fewer meetings
 and conferences. Party officials pay more frequent visits to factories, col-
 tive and state farms, and machine and tractor stations, and are doing more
 to help them to organise their work properly. But all too little has been
 accomplished in this respect. Unfortunately, there are still not a few party
 organisations whose officials devote most of their time and energies not to
 the living work of organisation but to endless conferences and to the com-
 position of reams of records, circulars etc. There is no need to say what
 such work is worth. For all these endless meetings and these voluminous
 records bring no practical results. The secretary of the Makhovsk District
 Party Committee (Vitebsk region, Byelorussia), Comrade Ignatenko, declared
 at the regional party conference: "For ten years now our district and a
 number of others have been criticised at every meeting and conference for
 lagging behind. In these ten years there have been nineteen district com-
 mittee secretaries and six chairmen of the district Soviet's executive com-
 mittee. Nine commissions came to investigate and study the situation on
 the spot, but for all that the district continues to lag behind. To all prac-
 tical purposes, neither the regional party committee nor the regional Soviet
 have done anything concrete to help the district."
 ,
 This penchant for record-writing is spreading to basic party units as well.
 And often enough with the encouragement of district party committees,
 which demand "full-length" minutes of meetings and conferences, all manner
 .of data, statistics and so on. The result is that some unit secretaries devote
 .:all their time not to the work of organisation but to the penning of all these
 .records and minutes.
 Here is a case in point-Comrade Rustamov, secretary of the party
 'organisation at the Kirov Collective Farm, Shamkhor district, Azerbaijan.
 His desk and bookcase are piled high with folders and ledgers. He keeps a
 record of party work among women, of work among new party members, of
 12
 w the party helps the Young Communist League organisation, lists of
 ho       l
 complaints submitted by collective farmers, of assignments to party mem-
 bers a record of the progress of party education, attendance at political
 "Wall Newspapers",
 classes and amateur art circles. He has dossiers labelled: Wall Newspapers ,
 "F1ash Bulletins", "Emulation Drive in Cattle Breeding", "Emulation Drive
 in Field Work", "Forest Friends Society". The work of party lecturers is
 recorded in three separate ledgers: "Tabulation of Work Done by Lee-
 turers" "Mass Political Work", "Daily Assignments for Lecturers". You
 can just imagine how much time is spent on this pen-pushing which, of
 course keeps the secretary away from the living work of organisation. And
 yet, in the collective farms, no educational work is conducted with milk-
 maids and cowmen. There is no mechanisation, no daily work schedule, or
 feed ration for the animals. Productivity is extremely low: the milk yield
 per cow for the year was only 484 litres.l And, of course, the secretary's
 dossiers yield no milk at all-in this respect they have proved hopelessly
 sterile.
 The work of the party apparatus must be improved, and every vestige of
 jureaucracY must be rooted out. Party organisations must concentrate on
 work among the masses. They must turn their attention-and very resolutely
 -to giving competent, concrete leadership, to effectively organising the
 propb aganda and application of front-rank experience and the achievements
 of science in the work of every factory, collective and state farm and machine
 and tractor station.
 The party apparatus must be reduced: it should consist oLa ;mall number
 of efficient and knowledgable workers. The central committee has reduced
 its apparatus by y 25 per cent. We have, I think, thereby made a beginning
 for further reductions. There should be a reduction in the apparatus of the
 central party committees in the Union Republics, and of regional, territorial,
 town and district party committees. Their work will only benefit from this.
 In this connection, I would like to say a few words about political depart-
 meets in civilian organisations. In their day, when they were first instituted,
 they played a certain positive part, but at the present time they have proved
 of little value and tend to duplicate the work of territorial party bodies.
 Comrade Khrt ishchov rightly drew attention to the technical backwardness
 on the railways. It stands to reason that the officials of the railway political
 departments must share responsibility for this state of affairs. For certainly
 it  was their duty to raise the question of technical backwardness in the
 railway system. But have they raised their voices, have they so much as
 whispered about the need for technical progress on the railways? No.
 Evidently the time is ripe for liquidating these political departments.
 End the Harmful Divorce of Ideological Work From Life
 COMRADES in the report of the central committee Comrade Khrushchov
 gave a comprehensive analysis of the ideological work of party
 organisations. He showed that the main failing now is that this work is
 to agreat extent divorced from life, that the people who carry it on are
 unable to draw general conclusions from advanced methods of communist

 construction which have stood the test of life and popularise those methods
 among the masses, and also that they do not combat to a sufficient degree
 negative phenomena that hinder our progress. That was correct and dust
 criticism.
 The party regards ideological work as an integral part of all its activities
 in building communism. Its main purpose is to give practical help in the
 building of communism, raising labour productivity, enhancing the socialist
 consciousness of the masses in every :.'ay, in relentlessly fighting against the
 survivals of capitalism in the minds of people, against bourgeois ideology
 and morals, arming the working people, and first and foremost the leading
 cadres, with Marxist-Leninist theory, and creatively developing this theory.
 Yet our ideological work is insufficiently concentrated on accomplishing
 all these big tasks and to a large extent it is being conducted to no purpose;
 it is reduced to learning by rote the same well-known formulas and proposi-
 tions, and not infrequently it brings up doctrinaires and dogmatists who are
 divorced from life.
 Our propaganda has been in a large measure directed into the past, into
 history, to the detriment of present-day problems. Moreover, the history
 of our party has been taught so that the experience of history has not helped
 in understanding current problems properly. The situation is bad as regards.
 the propaganda of economic knowledge and the experience of front-rank
 workers, engineers, collective farmers, the best industrial establishments,
 collective farms, state farms and teams.
 And so in the party educational system millions of Communists have
 studied for many years on end the erroneous views of the Narodniks,
 Economists and Bundists, but have not learned how to combat the survivals
 of capitalism in the minds of the people in our country and how to expose
 our present-day ideological enemies in the international arena; they have
 not studied the economic processes in the country, the experience of inno-
 vators, of the best industrial establishments and collective farms, and the
 achievements of science so as to manage economic affairs with greater
 efficiency, raise labour productivity, increase the production of material
 values and cope more successfully with other tasks of communist con-
 struction.
 Many rank-and-file Communists, too, realise the abnormal nature of this
 situation. Comrade Ignatov, a combine operator of the Mikhailovskaya
 Machine and Tractor Station, Stalingrad region, put it very well: "For the
 thirteenth year now I have been attending a party history circle. For the
 thirteenth time the propagandists are telling us all about the Bund. But
 have we no affairs that are more important than criticising the Bund? We
 are interested in the affairs of our machine and tractor station, district and
 region. We want to know about the present and the future, but our propa-
 gandists are so bogged down in the Narodnik and Bund business that they
 simply cannot get out of it."
 Party propaganda has, in this way, thus begun to lose its militant.
 Bolshevik spirit.
 Most of our propagandists are poorly versed in the economics of socialist
 production. Very often they are guided and trained by people who likewise
 do not know production or have a very general idea about it. What is the
 way out? The way out is resolutely to draw our leading economic, party
 14
 and government workers into the propaganda work, especially propaganda
 concerned with economic knowledge.
 Greater demands must be made of propagandists. We should not go
 after numbers but select people who are really able to dovetail our propa-
 ganda with the practical tasks of economic and cultural development.
 At the same time it is necessary to work constantly with the propagandists
 as well bearing in mind that the best of them can "run dry", if party bodies
 C not give them cguidance, do not direct their attention to urgent tasks and
 d                     ~
 do not help them with advice and provide them with concrete data and
 facts. The system of training and advanced training for propagandists has
 to be reorganised so that it should be possible to equip them with the
 necessary knowledge in the spheres of industry and agriculture.
 It is not only our propaganda, unfortunately, that is divorced from life
 and lags behind it ? this is largely the case on the theoretical front as well.
 Let us take for instance, the economic sciences. At the present stage
 the study of the deep-going processes of our society's economic development
 should be the chief, decisive trend in the study and development of Marxist
 thought. This does not imply that less attention should be given to the
 study of the past revolutionary experience of the party or to Marxist-Leninist
 philosophy. But Soviet society has entered a stage in its development whe
 the main attention should be concentrated on the study and elaboration of
 economic science, since it is the knowledge of the objective laws of develop-
 ment of socialist economy that enables us, first and foremost, to make use
 of these laws to accelerate the building of communism.
 The publication of the textbook of political economy is a favourable
 development in this sphere. But a textbook alone is not enough, and as
 regards serious scientific works containing a creative study of economic processes, there are, unfortunately, very few of them as yet.
 economists have made serious mistakes in their works. The party
 Some
 had to correct a number of ill-starred economists who were spreading
 anti Marxist views on the need to slow down the pace of development of
 heavy industry. The denial by economists of the category of moral deprecia-
 tion of machinery under socialism did serious harm, for it provided theo-
 retical tical justification for stagnation and conservatism in technology.
 Economists do not make an adequate study of the operation of the law
 of value in socialist production. That our architects, carried away by
 extravagances, have not worked out what this will cost the people and that
 personnel of machine and tractor stations and collective farms still very
 often do not work out the cost of a ton of grain or meat is undoubtedly
 measure to the fact that our economists have not elaborated
 due in some
 the problem of how the law of value operates concretely in our economy.
 The scientific study and elaboration of problems of economics in particular
 branches of the national economy is in a neglected state. The U.S.S.R. has
 research institutions whose task it is to study the economics
 more than forty
 of agricultural production. They have done very little, however, to sum-
 manse the wealth of experience accumulated by the collective and state
 farms. Publication of a textbook on agricultural economics and also of a
 textbook on industrial economics has dragged out much too long.
 In the sphere of philosophy, too, theoretical thought is divorced from the

 urgent tasks of our life, of communist construction.
 Dogmatism and doctrinairism have become widespread, because a section
 of the economists and philosophers have held aloof from practical life. The
 essence of the evil disease of doctrinairism is not simply that those infected
 with it cite quotations. all the time, whether they fit in or not; they regard
 as the supreme criterion of their correctness not practical experience but the
 pronouncements of authorities on this or that question. They lose the taste
 for studying real life. Everything is replaced by the culling of quotations and
 artful manipulation of those quotations. The slightest deviation from a
 quotation is regarded as a revision of fundamental principles. This activity
 of the doctrinaires is not merely futile, it is harmful.
 There is no doubt that the cult of the individual has greatly promoted
 the spread of dogmatism and doctrinairism. Worshippers of the cult of the
 individual ascribed the development of Marxist theory only to certain
 personalities and relied entirely on them. As for all the other mortals,
 allegedly they had to assimilate and popularise what was created by those
 personalities. The role of the collective  thinking  of our party  and that of
 fraternal parties in developing revolutionary theory, the role of the collective
 experience of the masses of the people was thus ignored.
 The party has never tolerated dogmatism, but the struggle against it has
 become especially acute at the present time. Present-day developments make
 the task of creatively developing Marxism more pressing than ever. Each
 day of building communism in our country and building socialism in the
 people's democracies brings to the fore ever new problems, which should be
 illuminated by theory. Gigantic changes are taking place all over the world
 and many problems now appear in a new light. In order to keep in step
 with life it is imperative to elaborate new problems in a scientific way, further
 to enrich and develop Marxism. Lenin, in drawing attention to the creative
 nature of Marxism, stressed that "we do not regard Marx's theory as some-
 thing completed and inviolable; on the contrary we are convinced that it
 has only laid the cornerstone of the science which socialists must further
 advance in all directions if they wish to keep pace with life" (Works (Russian
 edition), Vol. 4, p. 191).
 It is this task that now confronts us, and, in particular, our economists
 and philosophers. The party expects them to create fundamental scientific
 works based on a summary of the vast experience of socialist construction
 in the Soviet Union and the people's democracies and a deep-going analysis
 of the processes taking place in present-day capitalism-works which could
 be of theoretical help to government, economic and party cadres. Of course,
 when Marxists speak of advancing revolutionary theory by summarising the
 new practical experience and the achievements of the whole of science, they
 always  mean  the further development and enrichment of Marxism-
 Leninism on the basis of its bedrock principles, in uncompromising struggle
 against all attempts to revise these principles.
 The shortcomings in our ideological work are very serious and the party
 cannot tolerate them.
 It is the duty of all party organisations, from top to bottom, to eliminate
 these shortcomings, to secure a sharp turn in our ideological work towards life,
 practical activities, concrete questions of communist construction; propa-
 ganda and agitation should be closely linked, in the first place with the tasks
 16
 We must once again invest our ideological work with the Bolshevik
 militancy and purposefulness developed by the party throughout decades,
 is work should be subordinated to the struggle for the triumph of
 and this work   _
 communism.
 The party will continue to display tireless concern for propaganda and
 the creative development, on the basis of new experience, of Marxist-Leninist
 which is the scientific foundation of all our policies and all our
 theory,
 activities, the indispensable guide for the building of communism.
 confronting each industrial establishment or collective farm in increasing
 the production of material values.
 We must constantly work to enhance the socialist consciousness of the
 working people, to answer the urgent and pressing questions they raise; we
 must not relax the struggle against the survivals of capitalism in the minds
 of people, and we must resolutely expose the reactionary ideology of the
 imperialist bourgeoisie. Aiming at the further easing of international tension
 and strengthening of pease, we must not curtail our criticism of bourgeois
 ideology, imperialism and colonialism; on the contrary, in order to achieve
 these aims we must intensify our criticism, expose the aggressive ideology
 and policy of imperialism with convincing examples and facts, lay bare the
 exploiting essence of the capitalist system, contrasting this doomed system
 with the socialist system, revealing the latter's immense advantages and
 ~
 lofty and exalted principles and aims.
 Comrades, it is difficult to overestimate the historic significance of the
 present congress. The congress is opening up before our party, country and
 the Soviet people sweeping, breath-taking prospects in building communism
 which arouse feelings of J'oY and pride. The tasks we face are magnificent
 and we have inexhaustible potentialities for their successful accomplishment.
 A wonderful life is unfolding before the Soviet people. In the near future
 our socialist motherland will become still greater and mightier politically,
 economically and culturally. And by its side other fraternal socialist coun-
 tries, the entire great socialist commonwealth will grow, become stronger
 and prosper.
 Our party faces these splendid prospects monolithically united, militant
 and filled with great creative energies. It enjoys the undivided love and
 support of the whole Soviet people and is armed with the wise and invincible
 teaching of Marxism-Leninism.

 There are, however, countries where there is no longer any
 question of unemptoYment since this has been abolished by virtue
 of the fact that the causes of unemployment have themselves been
 abolished.
 In these countries the right to work is assured. not merely
 in the text of the Constitution, but in actuality. in real life.

 ,

 mercial trading with all countries.  It is at present becoming fur-
 ther increased and heightened in these countries under the weight.
 of the armaments burden.
 A considerable portion of the national income is absorbed by
 increased armament expenditure. and this also acts to the detriment
 of production for the civilian sector of the economy
 The grievous consequences of unemployment are felt iu the

 first place by y those out of work, but they do not spare certain other
 social strata, in particular small trades-people, peasants and even
 the owners of numerous small and medium undertakings.
 The big industrialists and trusts strive to profit from unenlploy-
 ment  crises by  suppressing  numbers  of small  and medium
 undertakings in order to remain in control of the market and in
 this way to augment still further their excessive profits.
 The trade union organisations can certainly not permit them-
 selves to be satisfied with establishing the facts. without at the
 same time acting  with                    ~,, the necessary energy to fight against
 ,
 unemployment and the causes which give rise to it.
 They struggle against this social curse of unemploynent and
 against the bankruptcy of capitalist society italist societ ; which has proved itself
 incapable of ensuring work to millions of able-bodied men and
 women, who have no other means of existence apart from their
 wages.
 Those trade  union organisatiois catering for workers in
 industries severely  affected by unemployment put the struggle
 against unemployment in the forefront of their responsibilities.
 The interchange of experiences of these struggles, which will
 take place at the time of the international Conference on Social
 Security, which will he held in Vienna in early Match, 1953, will
 make it  possible to  improve  the  methods  of dealing with
 unemployment.
 At the same time as the trade union organisations tight against
 unemployment, they also undertake the defence of the claims of
 the totully and partially unemployed.
 IN  THIS  FIELD  lT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
 THAT THE  RISK  OF  UNEMPLOYMENT  SHOULD BE
 COVERED BY SOCIAL SECURITY.
 In those countries where the workers are still without the
 benefit of Social Securit\, the trade union organisations should
 into their  ro~ grammes ' the necessary demand
 not fail to introduce i         p essary  entand
 that the risk of unemployment be covered by Social Security.
 It is necessary to start with the principle that every wage-
 earner, without consideration of his profession. family status c. ~r
 atege, from the moment when he is deprived of his wages through
 unemployment. must be able to draw benefits, without any ; restric-
 rm. of unemployment pay-commencing with the day
 tion, in the form.
 when he loses his employment, and without any time limit.
 Agricultural workers, who very often suffer unemployment,
 ,, must have the same right as industrial workers to receive unemploy-
 ment benefit without any restrictions.
 In matters regarding the scale of unemployment benefit, it is
 necessary, in our opinion, to make this the concern of the trade
 union organisations in each country.  BY taking into account the
 actual detailed situation in their own countries, they will be in a
 better position to determine the scale.                   -
 The condition of the partially unemployed should also be kept
 in sight by the trade unions.  We are at present witnessing the
 development of partial unemployment in the capitalist countries.
 There is no need to stress that workers receiving a reduced
 salary are exposed to want and privations, since even those who
 work a full week experience difficulties in satisfying their own
 needs and those of their families, in view of the gap which exists
 between wages and the cost of living.
 All these questions, bound up with the grave problem of
 unemployment, will be examined, discussed and clarified in the
 course of the work of the International Conference on Social
 Security.
 This pamphlet has for its aim simply to make a contribution
 to the discussion of these problems and to assist the trade unions
 in finding solutions which will enable millions of partially and
 totally unemployed to receive full employment, and provide a
 y     _
 dc-cent unemployment benefit to those who remain " unemployed
 in spite of themselves.,.
 Tn'c5.. ?e d;'sciAssions, like the campaign itself, will be carried out in the spirit of the broadest possible working class unity, which

 HOW TO DEAL WITH
 UNEMPLOYMENT
 N the capitalist countries, the forms in which insurance against
 unemployment exists and their range are extremely varied,.
 extending from the complete absence of any sYstem, or of systems
 extreme)} restricted in respect of the numbers of people affected
 and of the value of the benefits allowed. This makes it particularly
 difficult to formulate the basic characteristics of unemployment
 insurance.
 The fundamental reasons far these profound differences are
 of course to be found in the variety of the concrete economic .
 conditions. the way these have developed and the resultant rela-
 tion. of class forces.  There is thus a direct relation between, on
 the one hand, the various situations of the market and the struggle
 waged by the working class in order to protect itself against
 unemployment. and on the other hand, the concrete system
 brought into being.   In general, there exists more extensive
 insurance in countries with an advanced economic development
 and where the working class has emphasised the problem in the
 course of its strubgbgles.   In countries where, by reason of a
 retarded  economic  development,  unemployment  has  become
 inherent in the sYstem, and is growing, the systems in existence are
 generally restricted.  In these cases their extension presents basic
 problems. whose solution in terms of. Precautionary measures is
 possible on condition that this is organised on a much broader
 basis.
 Before entering on an analysis of the characteristics assumed
 by social     precautions  against unemployment in  the various
 countries, it would be well to examine briefly the effects of
 insurance of this kind.
 The Effects of Unemployment Benefit
 WHATEVER may be its forms and financial requirements..
 unemployment benefit entails a certain amount of expen-
 diture.  It is essential that a part of the national income, without consideration of the means by which it is to be set aside, should
 be devoted to allowances for the unemployed.  As long as this.
 levy had to be supported exclusively by the persons concerned, as
 was the case in the former Workers' Mutual Aid Societies, and as

 le in all the voluntary mutual aid funds, this
 was the general rule
 protection expressed itself in the redistribution of a portion of the
 income of the working class within the limits of the working class
 ltselt, without profits or interest being at all affected.  But in pro-
 portion as the struggle of the workers developed, the employers
 were compelled to assume in whole or in part, whether directly
 by contributions or indirectly by taxation, the financial burden of
 un em to ment insurance.  (In the caPitalist countries the costs at

 and the employers, with or without state participation.  In some
 countries  however, e.g., Italy, the workers have succeeded in
 making the employers bear the entire burden of insurance.)
 Insurance of this kind deals a blow at profits by bringing
 about an increase in the price of labour without a proportionate
 increase in the output or price of the goods produced.
 It is thus entirely understandable that the employers have
 .ahemPted and are still atempting by every means to avoid the
 application of this sort of insurance, or to aPP1Y it only in so far
 as they are compelled to do so.
 On the other hand, the fact must be taken into consideration
 that in numerous markets controlled by monopolies, the most
 powerful groups of employers, that is those who dominate the big
 factories, have succeeded in transferring to prices, and in conse-
 quence to the consumers, at least a part of the increase in the costs
 of production resulting from the system of unemployment insurance,
 and in this way diminishing the effect of the latter on their profits.
 Another consequence of unemployment insurance makes itself
 felt in the development of capitalist production.  We well under-
 stand the reasons why this cannot function without a certain mass
 of unemployed workers, who in offering their labour power, cause
 .
 rts price to be lowered and thus keep down the wages of the
 employed personnel to a level consistent with high profits.  In fact,
 capitalism keeps down the wages by playing off the unemployed
 against those in employment.  But in order that this stabilisation
 and even reduction of wages can be put into practice, it is necessary
 that the unemployed person should have no other sources of income
 than his labour power, which he is not in a position to utilise.
 That is to say, he is held in a vice by his own needs and those of
 his family.
 Now the application of social insurance schemes includes
 economic benefits which allow the unemployed person a certain
 purchasing power and have the effect of strengthening his resistance
 and making it possible for him to refuse to sell his labour power
 below its value.  If, for example, the benefits represent 60% of the
 average wage and allow the unemployed person to obtain for him-
 self at least a minimum subsistence, then he will not only not accept
 a wage inferior to the benefits he is receiving already, but since
 his livelihood is ensured, he will be able to offer resistance and to
 .
 fight to obtain the same treatment as the employed workers.  The

 `'effect on the level of wages of the existence of a mass of un-
 employed is reduced in proportion as social insurance is more
 .effective. Thus the latter does not merely attack the profits of the
 emPtoYers like the other forms of social insurance, but at the same
 .
 time represents a significant check to the continuance of a low level
 .
 ?.'of wages, and so is a favourable condition for the raising of this
 level.  It is only when one considers this double effect-on profits
 ' and on the level of wages (these last constituting in effect an indirect
 'attack on profits)-that the strength of the employers' resistance
 .
 is explained, resistance of such a kind that this form of social
 insurance is non-existent in many countries, or else is restricted to
 those categories of workers who have succeeded in obtaining it in
 the ' course of their. struggles.
 In certain states social legislation does not in any way provide
 for unemployment insurance.  This is the case in a large number
 of semi-colonial countries-Egypt, Turkey, Iran, Iraq, etc.-where
 . Production relations are still semi-feudal.  These countries are,
 for the most part, openly exploited by foreign imperialism, and
 have an excessive labour force with a very low standard of living.
 :The same conditions prevail in the majority of technically back-
 ward countries which have reached a certain level of industrial
 .development, usually financed by foreign capital, but where .the
 local labour force is relatively poor.  In these countries the
 .employers do their best to keep wages down in order to guarantee
 .high profits.  Such conditions exist in the majority of Latin-
 American countries.
 In Portugal, social unemployment protection still assumes the
 form of charitable aid, reminiscent of the " Poor Law " of Queen
 Elizabeth, or the " Institution " of the Papal States in force up to
 :
 1860-70.  Even in those developed capitalist countries where un-
 employment is not a permanent feature and is only very limited-
 during periods of less prosperity-and where the wage level is
 fairly high, there are no compulsory forms of insurance against
 unemployment.  This is left to voluntary mutual organisations,
 which are administered for the most part by the trade unions,
 with some financial assistance on the part of the State.  Sweden
 and Finland are typical examples of this position.
 As to the countries where compulsory unemployment insurance
 systems are in force, a comparison of the numbers of people
 covered with those of the health insurance systems shows that the
 first usually embraces a very much smaller number of workers than the second.  This demonstrates that social insurance against un-
 employment in the capitalist countries assumes a more restricted
 form than health insurance.

 We must first of all explain what we understand by a system
 . ",governed by insurance qualifications."  Such a system of social
 insurance exists when the right to receive appropriate benefits is
 '
 aot granted to an n individual in. his capacity as a member of the
 ,
 . eomimtinity , or as possessing some particular quality, for example,
 worker but when this right proceeds from the fact of his

 n."insurance system of this kind, even though compulsory, retains
 a1l ' the characteristics of private insurance, since the right to
 . . benefit is not an. automatic right, but proceeds merely from the
 fait of Navin r contributed to the finances of the social insurance
 . system itself.
 lt is necessary to stress that the application of such criteria
 i~ -iot made only in countries where there is large-scale, permanent
 unemployment, but also in countries of less unemployment.  Now
 . if in the cases where there is large-scale, permanent unemployment,
 complete social protection for the whole working class presents
 financial problems; `such difficulties can certainly not be used to
 justify the existence of. Protection based on an insurance system
 (sometimes extremely restricted), where  unemployment is not
 permanent and where its extent is comparatively limited.
 of all the capitalist countries, only Australia and New Zealand
 ave instituted social security systems protecting the entire work-
 b.
 ing. population, without excePtion, against the risk of unemploy-
 ment. and guaranteeing benefits regulated by the sole condition
 that the applicant should have reached working age and should be

 ;.   It is nevertheless clear that a system. based on. insurance,
 . however broad this may be, not only fails for technical reasons to

 '  . The existence of a system. based on the insurance principle
 arises from a denial of the right of the entire working class to

 hose of the two last categories.
 The most common systems are t
 .
 Such a classification is, however, hardly a complete one.  For
 example, in the United States, side by side with the federal laws
 (in force for the whole country), providing for compulsory insurance
 of workers in certain sectors of the economy, there are local laws
 as well covering categories which vary from one State to another:
 In Switzerlarid a system insuring all employed workers is in force in 16 cantons, whereas in the other 6, such provision either does
 ,
 not exist; or functions only on a voluntary basis.  In countries
 having entirely voluntary schemes, it is evident that these are ,Limite ?a ' to the most easily organisable sectors of industry, and thus
 exclude not only workers in various branches of the economy. but
 also all workers in small-scale industry and in more scattered
 sectors of production.
 The systems in force vary considerably from one country 'to'
 another and range from the absence of any sort of protection right
 up to, in some rare cases, the protection of the entire working
 population-with the most diverse intermediate stages. The extent
 .
 of the system naturally depends on economic conditions and on the
 struggles of the workers.  Thus, for example. in certain countries
 where there is only a certain amount of scattered unemployment,,
 may be explained b the fact that unemPto

 work, in which there is no concentration of workers.  Such are
 agricultural vorkers seasonal and domestic workers, and in certain
 .
 cases workers engaged in small undertakings or handicrafts, or
 workers receivin : wages below a certain minimum level.  It is
 evident that exclusions of this kind are not made by reason of the
 absence of unemployment risk, or the absence of economic need-
 which is the fundamental reason for bringing about the adoption
 of. sonic form of social protection against unemployment.  In fact
 it is probable that these categories of workers suffer on the average
 more frequently from unemployment and that their economic
 situation is in general worse.  These exclusions are actually due
 to the fact that, arising from the low degree of organisation of
 these workers, the employers, by not including them in the system,
 are able to secure considerable economies.  Thus they have also
 at their disposal a body of unemployed not receiving any compen-
 sation, and tending by their unlimited competition on the labour
 market to exercise a downward pressure on wages.
 A rapid examination of the laws in force in countries posses-
 sing some kind of protection allows us to form a sufficiently clear
 idea of the kind of exclusion carried out in respect to employed
 'workers.
 there is no exclusion in Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain
 and the  16 Swiss cantons,  which  have  introduced a  system
 embracing all employed workers.  In the countries where there is
 .,
 only inconsiderable and temporary unemployment, as for example
 ~
 Austria, Nor\vav  and  Holland,  there  are  fairly considerable
 ecePttons.  In Norwasy, for example, not only employees in public
 ~
 .services, but also ?"lshermen, domestic workers and all those earning
 less than (j0t) crowns a year are, in practice, excluded from
 insurnce. This, moreover, holds good for all \\'orkers without
 permanent occupation, that is to say precisely those who have the
 s
 greatest need of benefits in order to make up their insufficient
 +neome.  In Austria, public officials and employees, agricultural
 .workers, foresters and domestic staffs are not included in the
 insurance.  In the Netherlands, insurance covers all employed
 v~iorkers, with the exception of domestic workers with an income
 Tower than 6,000 florins a year.  In prance, a country possessing
 one of the most inclusive systems, since it embraces not only
 emrlcyed \vorkers, but a!so-which exists in no other country not
 possessing a social security system for all workers-writers, artists
 possessing
 .and young people in search of their first employment, seasonal
 workers are nevertheless left without protection.
 Countries with more unemployment, like Belgium and the
 United States, have unemployment insurance systems with very
 serious exclusions.  In Belgium, apprentices, domestic workers
 and. workers in pudic services are not included in the system.  In
 _cd.dition there are certain restrictions for agricultural workers. In
 the United States, a highly developed country where un?mploy-
 ' ent, already high enough in normal times, reaches terrifying

 proportions in periods of crisis, the following categories are in
 practice excluded from every kind of protection by either federal
 or state legislation : all workers in the federal or local public services, agricultural workers, domestic workers, and all those
 V
 working in concerns which have too few workers to come under
 the unemployment laws.  Thus. in effect. unemployment protection
 -
 covers only workers in large-scale industry.
 In. countries where there is considerable inherent unemploy-
 ment there are also very restrictive systems in being.  In Western
 GermanY, although there is no system of protection on a national
 scale. but only local systems, the exclusion of agricultural workers,
 of domestic and seasonal workers can he considered an accom-
 plished fact for the whole country.  In Italy, agricultural and
 seasonal workers. workers in public services, and those not Lavin
 g
 continuous employment are excluded, as well as all part-time
 workers.
 It is appropriate to make some observations on the technical
 difficulties which it is claimed are involved in establishing protec-
 tion against unemployment in agriculture and in general in seasonal
 and non-permanent occupations. and which the ruling class makes
 use of as a pretext to justify its failure to meet its obligations.
 When it is a matter of unemployment or of being temporarily out of employment (as we shall see, these are two quite different
 problems). the   lu ion s       is particularly easy to find.  It is evident
 that it is a question rather of insuring the workers against a future,
 uncertain risk. by guaranteeing a certain income for the period
 already known in advance, during which these workers, for reasons
 independent of their will. are unable to work at their usual trade,
 or in any other Jjob, since there is an absence of demand.  It is
 thus a matter of guaranteeing a yearly reserve of income, whose
 size should he related to the duration of employment in the given
 sector, and also to the possibility possessed by the particular
 economies to utilise the man-Power available during the " off-
 season " in other sectors.  The matter is therefore far from being
 without a solution.  In confirmation of this. it is sufficient to cite
 the fact that this problem has been concretely solved in numerous
 capitalist countries without the emergence of any of the difficulties
 warned against.
 ;'>ecessar1 Conditions for the Right to Benefits
 As lit' have already said. an insurance system does not guarantee..
 '
 even in the best examples. anything but incomplete and defec-
 titie protection.  In reality. the first and principal effect of such.
 -
 'stems is to exclude from the right to benefit a fairy- considerable
 section of the workers. `he  workerseven those included in the system. since

 a certain sum of contributions, or a certain period of employment
 during a prescribed period preceding the unemployment.         Since
 no contributions can be paid if the worker is not occupied in a
 branch of industry where insurance is obligatory, the right to
 benefits is made dependent on the work recently performed. There
 can be no question that within the framework of capitalist economy.
 the establishment of such qualifications     ~ is unjustifiable, since the
 possibility of obtaining work does not depend only on the will of
 the worker.  Under such conditions, all young ll }young people in search of

 The significance of the exclusion of young people in countries
 'with permanent unemployment, is absolutely clear.                     An increasing
 number of workers will be unable to find work, will be left without
 resources, and will exert pressure on the labour market, thus
 lowering the standard of living of the mass of the working class.
 in. countries where unemployment is only temporary, absorption
 into Production of new contingents of man-power never follows at
 once.  Moreover, the process of absorption may be considerably
 slowed down by the effects of a crisis which throws young people
 out of work.   They are not absorbed into production until
 economic recovery begins to make itself felt.  Thus, even in
 countries which normally make use of their new sources of power,
 young workers may remain without work for a considerable time-
 without having the right to claim benefit.
 The fact that such conditions as the payment of contributions
 or a time qualification are exacted, excludes from the right to
 benefits all those who for one reason or another have not been in
 a position to fulfil the necessary conditions before becoming
 i.inemPtoYed.  The extent of these exclusions depends naturally on
 the conditions exacted and the situation in the labour market of
 .the country concerned.
 These conditions, although varying considerably from country
 to_country. all display a tendency to exclude the greatest possible
 number of the unemployed.  In order to have the right to claim
 benefit, it is necessary in Great Britain to have paid contributions
 for 26 weeks.  In Norway, 45 insurance weeks over the 4 years
 preceding the unemployment are demanded, and in Austria, 20
 insurance vreeks during the course of the year preceding the
 compensation claim.  In the Netherlands, 156 working days during
 the foregoing year are requited.  In Belgium 6 months of work

 .
 Duration of Benefits
 system based on the principle of insurance is incapable of
 Aguaranteeing benefits for the entire period of unemployment,
 even in cases of temporary unemployment, and above all when unemployment
 ~ is increasing as a result of a cyclical crisis.  Since
 this kind of system is the most widespread, it follows that in the
 ~aPitalist countries social protection is, in the majority of cases,
 limited in respect of its duration.  The only exceptions are
 Australia and New Zealand, which have instituted a social security
 organisation, and also France and Belgium, whose legislation takes
 no account of time limits for the receipt of benefit.
 In certain cases, the limitation of the duration is uniformly
 applied to all insured persons.  En others an extension (equally
 limited) is only granted if the contributions of the person insured
 exceed the required minimum by a fixed amount.  In others again,.
 the duration of benefit is made dependent on qualifications in time
 (for example,  1  week of benefit for 2, 3, or 4 weeks of
 contributions).
 In Great Britain, for example, benefits are granted for a
 period of. 180 daYs,. which is extended to one year, if the insured
 person has paid at least 50 contributions during the year preceding
 his last benefit claim.  After the expiration of the benefit period,.
 the unemployed person must, in order to be able to receive com-
 pensation again, be able to show a credit of 13 other weekly
 contributions.  In Austria, benefits are granted for a period of 12
 weeks, if contributions have been paid over at least 20 weeks;
 for 20 weeks, if 30 weekly contributions have been lodged in the
 course of the 2 Years preceding the demand: for 30 weeks, if
 during the course of the 5 years preceding the demand, contri-
 butions have been paid for 30 weeks at the minimum.  In Italy,.
 the duration of benefit is for 180 days, without regard to the time
 over which contributions have been lodged.  In the Union of South
 Africa, one week of benefit is granted for 4 weeks of contributions,.
 in Norway one week of benefits for 3 contribution weeks with a
 maximum of 15 weeks of compensation annually.  In the Nether-
 lands, unemployed people have the right to 48 days of compensa-
 tion paid out by the professional insurance organisation and to
 78 days of benefit paid out by the ordinary insurance, or, if he
 does not possess the right to trade insurance, he receives benefits
 paid out by the ordinary insurance over a period of 126 days.
 Without paying attention to the method which determines the
 duration of benefits, it is apparent that its limitation is characterised
 by y the exclusion from compensation of all unemployed who, after
 the expiration of the limits laid down, have not been absorbed
 into production.   Wherever unemployment has  a permanent
 character, this is the equivalent of depriving the protection scheme
 of part of its value. Added to the other disqualifications, there
 results a profound difference between the number of unemployed
 who receive assistance and the actual number of unemployed, of
 which the first represents only a small percentage of the second.
 (For example, in Italy, the numbers benefiting from unemployment
 allocations represent  only  10-12%  of the total  numbers  of
 registered unemployed).
 Such limitations also involve exclusions from the right to
 claim compensation in situations of temporary unemployment. In
 the United States, only 50% of the unemployed receive benefits:
 in Switzerland, 40%; in Austria about 70g .  In normal times the
 o                                ~o
 severity of these exclusions is determined by the duration of the
 period for which. compensation is payable and by the mobility of
 labour, and in the last analysis by the volume and character of
 unemployment.                                                                      In times of crisis, the volume of exclusions
 increases as the crisis itself grows more serious.
 In some countries, as for example in Great Britain and

 Austria, the unemployed person whose right to obtain allowance
 has expired before he has found work and who is in a state of
 need, is able to claim certain other benefits, in most cases without
 any time limit.  However these benefits are not granted in the
 form of insurance benefits, but as public relief.  Parallel with the
 insurance systems there thus exist assistance schemes financed not
 by contributions, but by taxation.  This double system of protec-
 tion, when at a given moment relief takes the place of insurance
 which has run out, exists only in very few countries, where, b
 Y      Y                      - by
 reason of the local characteristics of unemployment, relief only
 entails a very limited expenditure, since not only the number of
 beneficiaries utilising these systems is small, but, moreover, the
 benefits available are inferior to those granted by the insurance
 organisations.
 The reason for which such " insurance criteria " are to he
 found  in  almost  all  unemployment  protection  systems  is
 y
 undoubtedly explained by the two-fold interest of the employers
 to pay out as little as possible and to keep the unemployed in the
 worst economic conditions, in order that they should constitute a
 factor tending to lower the  'age of the employed workers.  In fact.
 the short analysis that we have just made clearly , demonstrates
 that the workers excluded from lJprotection-the young people in
 ~
 search of their first job, the unemployed who are unable to satisfy
 the contribution demands, and those who are left without work
 after the expiration of the period of compensation-constitute a
 considerable mass of unemployed, unable to obtain compensation
 and exercising for these reasons severe competition on the labour
 market.
 Befefit Scales
 THE real_ scale of the benefits allowed in the different countries
 varies considerably.  They can be either fixed for the duration of
 the benefit or they y can vary according to a given index or according
 to the cost of living or level of wages.  The benefits can be set at
 a uniform amount for all insured people or they can vary according
 to the amount of contributions made, according to trade qualifi-
 cations or according to the wages drawn.
 It is necessary to make special mention of benefits which are
 not fixed.  By this we mean benefits granted according to systems
 which do not take into account any changes in the cost of living,
 except by special decision, as for example by a law establishing a
 new amount of compensation.
 This kind of benefit is characteristic not only of countries
 with a relatively stable currency, but also of countries with an
 unstable currency, such as Italy and Austria.  Now a system of
 fixed benefits presents in the present stage of capitalism a serious
 threat to the real value of the benefits. All recent experience shows
 us that a stable currency under capitalism cannot be achieved.
 The sharpening of capitalist contradictions by imperialist wars and
 compelled the final abandonment of any
 periodic cases have
 stable currency. Currency manipulation has become a characteristic
 of., present-day capitalism.  Further, all-out rearmament creates,
 inflation. flat~on.  This is why a system of fixed benefits under present
 permitting the employers to decide the real
 conditions amounts to value of benefits.
 Scales of benefit in capitalist countries are fixed according
 to the balance of class forces.  But if we examine the extent to
 which the level of benefits varies we find that only in exceptional
 cases does this exceed two thirds of the average wage.  In the
 between 60?i' and R0% according to the
 Netherlands, benefits vary            ,~        /
 number of dependents ,this percentage in. fact includes the family
 allowance lowancv supplements which implies the renunciation of family
 l.
 allowance,.  In other countries the scale is much lower: in Austria
 from .>8,  to  0~'/, in Great Britain, below 40%.  In Belgium it
 ~~ ,,      ,~
 is 5e wage for unskilled labour (i.e., the lowest wage).
 t% ) n         of t11i    ,
 In the Scandinavian countries it stands at about two-thirds of the
 age and in ltal  at less than 30"? (including supplements for
 dependents).
 The compensation scales although generally including supple-
 ments for dependents, are nevertheless expressed as a percentage
 tf the net wage, excluding r the family allowance. The compensation
 ~
 eived therefore represents a considerably lower percentage of
 received
 the worker's ordinary income.
 The low general !evel of allowances is mainly due to the
 tendency of the employers to impose the biggest possible economies.
 In the countries where unemployment is temporary and affects few
 people the desire of the employers to use unemployment to force
 down wages also plays a part.  The lower the benefits, the more the unemployed person. is driven to exert pressure on the labour
 ,,,,
 market by his search for work. That is why in certain countries
 where benefits are not limited with respect to time, and are still
 paid after the expiration of the right to draw benefit, the amount
 is reduced after a certain period.  in this way the unemployed person, his resources further reduced, is even more " inclined" to
 ask less for his labour power.  In France, compensation is in this
 way reduced by 20% after one year of assistance, and thereafter
 by   ~o 1.0?~ for each subsequent year. In Great Britain public assis-
 tare benefits are less than three quarters of the benefits paid out
 by the insurance.
 When benefits are ridiculously low (as in general is the case in. .  countries having high permanent unemployment, and where
 only a small number of unemployed receive assistance after the
 expiry of the insurance benefits), not oniY is the effect which they
 exert on the consumer goods market a minimum one as a result
 of the very   .. insignificant sums paid. but further than this, demand
 tends to fall.

 Finance and Organisation
 FINANCING differs considerably from country to country, both
 as regards method and the source.  A simple classification of
 methods may be made as follows.
 (a) Financing ing exclusively by the State, which covers costs
 by taxation. This method is used not only in countries with 'a
 social security system, but equally in other countries:
 ,
 (b) Financing partially by the State, partially by contrA-
 butions.     State assistance may be expressed by an annual
 appropriation of a stated sum, as in Great Britain, or by an.
 appropriation when the need arises, as in Belgium and
 Norway.      Contributions may be shared between workers and
 employers, in equal or unequal parts, as is the case in.
 practically every country, or may be the exclusive responsi-
 bility of the workers, as in Sweden and Switzerland.
 c) Financing only by contributions, without any assis-.
 tance from the State.  In this case also, the contributions may
 be shared between. the workers and the employers, or may be
 the responsibility of a single category, as in Italy, where they
 are borne f:xclusively by the employers.
 Contributions may be based on a fixed scale, or may be made
 proportional to wages, with a top limit, or again may be propor-
 tional to the real income.  In Great Britain, Norway and Austria
 contributions are fixed. In other countries where financing is
 carried out by contribution, a top limit exists.
 The effects of financing exclusively by contributions totally or
 partially supported by the industrial enterprises are well-known. A system of this sort determines the amount of contribution levied
 in relation to the demands of compensation and not to the income
 of the particular industrial concern.  That is to say, that the
 economic possibility of supporting the expenditure is not taken into
 account.  This has the effect of favouring all activities requiring
 a small labour force, that is, utilising mechanised processes, which
 are in short the large monopolist undertakings.  The others who
 are obliged to employ many work people, and who belong to the
 less monopolised sectors of the economy, are put at a disadvantage..
 Furthermore, contributions                       b are like taxation of wages, used as a
 pretext to reduce employment.
 The introduction of a top limit for contributions, or still
 worse, the establishment of a fixed contribution scale, brings about
 the suppression of any , relationship between income and contribu-
 tion.  In other words, if a wage exceeds the maximum limit, or
 if the contribution. is fixed, any extension of the working day fails
 to bang with it an increase in contributions which has the same
 effect as reducing the cost of overtime work and permitting the
 substitution of overtime for the taking-on of fresh workers.  Fur-
 thermore  this  tendency  considerably  increases  the                              injustice
 existing in the distribution of the costs of social protection in
 22
 respect of certain branches of production.  In fact it increases the
 possibility of making the branches of industry with a large iun-
 skilled labour force (where wages are below average) bear the main.
 burden, whereas those branches of production which employ a
 small number of specialist workers (whose wages are above the
 .
 average) are able to profit from the fact that the cost of specialised
 work does not cost more.  In this way the strongest among the
 me~ to yers' groups-those dominating the great monopoly con-
 employers'
 cerns with a high level of mechanisation and employing a certain
 number of specialist workers-succeed in passing on the greatest
 burden of insurance costs to small and medium industry.  This
 defective distribution exists in the same country between the
 more economically developed sectors and the more backward
 sectors.  In the case of the first, a considerable part of the wages
 are above the average, while in the others, the wages are average.
 That is to say that the deductions will be greater in relation to
 income in the second group, i.e., precisely in the poorest sectors.
 Contributions imposed on the workers represent an absurdity
 from any point of view.  The insurance benefits form a part of
 the income of the working class, that is to say of the price of
 their labour power.  It is therefore quite obvious that the price
 of labour, in other words the wage, plus the parts of the wage
 which are really a form of delayed investment, i.e., contributions
 or taxes, which are the equivalent of benefits---must be paid b;
 the employers.  From this it follows that not only the contribu-
 tions, but also taxation destined to finance the benefits  (in

 countries where insurance is financed with assistance from the
 State). must come out of profits in all its forms-industrial profit,
 rent and interest.  Where the State participates in financing, this
 must be utilised to adjust the cost of insurance according to
 economic capacity (a function which a system based on contri-
 butions is unable to accomplish).  The collection of the requisite
 amounts should be carried out by a personal and progressive tax
 on unearned income, and not by indirect taxation, which has to
 be supported by the workers in their capacity as consumers, and still less by a percentage
 tax (as is the case in New Zealand) where

 only a minority of the workers participate in the management of

 COMPLETE PROTECTION AGAINST
 UNEMPLOYMENT
 OUR examination has established that unemployment is a normal
 phenomenon of capitalism.  We have shown its manifestation
 ,
 in present-day conditions, and also the forms and extent of social
 protection provided for in particular countries.
 We have seen that social protection does not exist in many
 countries, and that the problem of making both ends meet while
 unemployed is left to the individual worker. We have seen how in
 other countries, far from there being guaranteed protection for the
 ~vhole working class, such protection is limited to certain categories
 of workers who sometimes only represent a minority of the
 working population who must have been able to satisfy certain
 conditions laid down, in the matter of contributions made or work
 done.  Finally, we have seen that the benefits are inadequate and
 everywhere are limited in duration.  Thus, in the great majority of
 everywhere
 countries which have instituted a form of unemployment protection,
 this is oaganised on a restrictive basis and is therefore incapable of
 insuring satisfactory protection.
 The Right to Social Protection
 The first problem is to define the number of people to be
 covered by unemployment insurance.  We have seen that in the
 schemes at present in force, protection is extended to various cate-
 gories of workers either because they are insured or because the
 scheme covers the industry in which they work.  In other words,
 the right to claim protection is conditioned.  Any reform having
 for its sole aim the inclusion in the existing scheme of ^ certain
 categories of workers at present excluded from it, for examples
 ~.
 agricultural, seasonal or domestic workers, would only mean a
 purely quantitative change affecting the numbers entitled to social protection .   without at all altering its restrictive conditions.
 We must. however, reaffirm the principle that social protec-
 tion must aPP1Y to every worker who becomes unemPtoYed
 without regard to whether he is registered with an insurance scheme,
 or                                                                                 he has worked in a prescribed job.
 whether
 Production is not a series of private acts, but a collective act
 of society. The right to obtain protection must for this reason be
 based on the fact that the workers as a class produce the national
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/08/11 : CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 wealth, and that the incident covered by the protection occurs
 independently of their will. In fact, in capitalist society the possi-
 bility of finding work does not depend on the wish of the worker,.
 but on the demand for labour and in the last analysis, on the
 organisation of production.  If capitalist production, being based.
 on private profit and not the needs of consumption, 1s unable to
 make use of the available labour, then it must at least guarantee
 adequate social protection to workers whom unemployment has
 left without resources.
 Social protection against unemployment is therefore a right
 which is applicable to the whole working class without exception.
 Not only workers employed in industry but also groups of young
 workers, agricultural, seasonal and domestic workers and others at
 present excluded by legislation in almost every capitalist country,
 must be covered.
 As soon as we recognise the right of the whole working class
 to receive unemployment protection, it becomes clear that benefits
 will apply to any unemployed person who can prove he is a worker,.
 without any condition of insurance qualification, of contributions
 or of work.
 There can be no question that this qualification must apply to
 all those who, before losing their employment, have worked in
 some sector or other of production or distribution.  It is a different
 matter for young people in. search of their first employment and
 for agricultural workers, who at the same time, are owners of a
 small holding incapable of absorbing, and in consequence of
 repaying all their labour power.  For the first group the difficulty
 can. be easily overcome, by fixing a minimum age-at the end of
 the compulsory education, period or at the beginning of the legal
 working age-for compulsory registration with an employment
 :
 bureau which amounts to a certificate of qualification to become
 a worker.
 The question of the agricultural worker is more complicated.
 This includes also owners of small holdings which prove insufficient
 to afford them full subsistence. But in this case also the difficulties
 arising when it is necessary to assess them as workers with a right
 to social protection can be overcome, since it is possible to establish
 the period of real unemployment during the year.
 It is necessary to protect every worker not merely against
 absolute unemployment but also against partial unemployment,
 resulting in a partial loss of income.
 Duration and Scale of Benefits
 HAVING defined the categories entitled to social protection during
 unemployment, and the bask conditions for the granting of
 benefits, we must now determine the nature of this compensation.
 The aim of a complete scheme of protection must necessarily
 be (if protection is not to degenerate into charity) the defence of
 the living standards of the working class against all risks of society
 L
 Ib
 27

 which are attended by a loss or diminution of income, an increase
 of expenditure, or both occurring simultaneously.  The scheme
 must therefore provide specific benefits which will permit those
 . affected to get by without a serious lowering of their living condi-
 tions.  This is why, from the moment when a social security
 system has been put into operation, the living standards of the
 working class will depend not merely on total earnings (i.e., after
 deduction of all stoppages), but also on the sum of benefits, whether
 these replace the wage (as sickness, accident and unemployment
 allowances) or whether they add to it (as family allowances).
 To the worker, unemployment means a loss of earnings.  It
 is naturally accompanied by a lowering of his living standards and
 constitutes an extra burden for the employed members of his family.
 Social protection against such an eventuality must therefore neces-
 sarily provide adequate compensation to make up for the wage he
 previously received.
 Taking into consideration that the right to unemployment pro-
 tection applies to all workers from the moment of unemployment,
 and that the aim of this protection is to maintain a certain living
 standard, the cash benefits should cover the whole period of
 unemployment, without conditions or time limits.   The latter
 actually has no valid justification except in the desire to save a
 portion of the benefits.  If a time limit should be established, the
 effect could only be to exclude from compensation all those who,
 through no fault of their own, were unable to find employment.
 r ~
 Benefits must cover the entire period of unemployment.  They
 fl-lust. be granted until the moment when the out-of-work person,
 who must be registered with an employment bureau, receives an
 offer of work at his own trade.  It is obvious that an offer of work
 at Some  other trade cannot be used as an excuse to terminate
 benefit.
 it would otherwise be really too simple for the ruling class to
 reduce the number of            'benefit.    n those receiving          I  circumstances
 where there is no possibility of taking on workers with given trade

 the unemployed into economic life.
 It is more complicated to fix the rates of benefit than . to
 decide the duration period, in spite of the fact that we have already
 defined the aim of social protection as the defence of the living
 standards of the workers.  For obvious reasons it is impossible to
 demand full-scale compensation for the worker, i.e., compensation.
 equalling the amount of wages previously earned or which would
 have been earned if the worker had been allowed to take part in
 production.
 On the other hand it is impermissible that the benefits should
 be so low as to create a considerable gap between the living stan-
 dard of the unemployed, and that of the unemployed, workers. If
 this were the case, the very aim of social protection would be corn-
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/08/11 : CIA-RDP81-01043R000700100003-6
 promised, without mentioning the drastic reduction in demand for
 consumer goods which would follow, with the consequent threat.
 to wages resulting from the competition taking place on the labour
 market.
 In. order to determine the scale of benefit, it is necessary there-
 fore to take the various factors into account.  Benefits must ensure
 the unemployed person not merely a simple existence, but also a
 given and determinable living standard on the basis of concrete
 needs, which should approximate to those of. the employed workers.
 If the level of wag      ~ es in a given country allows the working class to
 enjoy only a very reduced living standard ,compensations must not
 be allowed to differ at all significantly from this level, while in
 cases where the wage level is more favourable to the workers. the
 gap may be wider although to a limited extent.  In any case, we
 are of the opinion that the scale of real compensation should vary
 between 70% and 85% of normal income.  Benefits below this
 level would he insufficient to satisfy the most essential and imme-
 diate needs.  In fact, if we examine the average level of wages in
 the capitalist countries, we can establish that the greatest proportion
 of wages is absorbed  by the most urgent needs, such as food.
 clothing and housing. Any \vorsening of the situation makes it
 extremely difficult to satisfy those basic needs.
 It goes without saying that the living standard of the unem-
 ployved person depends o        ~ on his right to benefit and on the value
 of the latter.  But the living standard of the unemployed is not a
 ,.
 matter which concerns them alone, since the lack of any adequate
 protection compels them to offer their labour power at a price
 lower than that demanded by the employed workers. The existence
 of a proper unemployment protection system and the struggle to
 obtain it are thus of direct interest to the entire working class, not
 only because its members may ; in future be caught by r unemploy-
 ment. but above all as a medium of defence and in order to
 eliminate the obstacles which hinder the improvement of wage
 levels.  This common interest must therefore form the basis of

 ment protection scheme.
 If we tackle the question. of compensation scales. we must. con-
 cern ourselves with the problem of how to determine this compen-
 sation.                             We already know why it is necessary- to do away with
 benefits of fixed amount. since these are incapable of being adapted
 automatically to a new situation.
 If protection is to be limited merely to guaranteeing a certain
 purchasing power to the unemployed, it would be necessary to
 establish the relationship between the benefits and the cost of
 living.  in this manner the real value of the compensation, ex-
 pressed in consumer goods, would be able to adapt itself more or
 less completely to the variations in the value of money.  Thus we
 would have succeeded in ensuring the " constancy " of benefits in

 development of wages.  In other words, if employed workers were
 to obtain a wage increase during the period in question, without
 the cost of living being affected the real value of the compensation
 would nevertheless remain constant, which means that the gap
 between the living standards of the employed and unemployed
 workers would be increased.

 of the working class by means of social protection. then comPensa-

 the Soviet Union from the air, and  conversely, the Soviet
 Union to control the territory of the United States, we
 shall have no tall~s with you on questions of disarmament.
 It is obvious to all that this form of control is unaccept-
 able  because it does not solve the problem. Assume that
 American aircraft begin to fly over the Soviet Union, and Soviet aircraft over the United States. What will be the
 use? The aircraft will fly, and the airmen will see: there is
 a town here,               b a village there; here troops are stationed, there
 some factories are located. Supposing we see that the Ameri-
 cans have a large number of airfields. In that case we shall
 have to conclude that we must make more headway so as
 not to fall behind, and build several more airfields. (Anima-
 tion.) The Americans, in their turn, see what we have, and
 will also say that they must have more airfields and aircraft,
 and perhaps other things too.
 hence, if we accept this proposal, it will. onlY lead to an
 arms race. \Ye say to the Western statesmen: If you are
 afraid to disarm,  to destroy S your bomb stocks, let us
 pledge our word of honour as gentlemen that none of us
 'vill ever employ atomic weapons. They reply l  that the
 ~                      Y   Iy          Y
 cannot pledge their word, because, supposedly, they need
 hydrogen and   atomic bombs to maintain "equilibrium."
 And what does this "equilibrium" mean? It means an arms
 race. Hence, considerable resources, a substantial propor-
 tion of the national labour goes not for the peaceful develop-
 went of the country, but for military purposes. Can we
 continue to reduce armaments unilaterally, when the Western
 Powers do not want to do likewise? I shall answer this
 question in the words of a Russian sa3ling: if you live with
 b    ~
 wolves, you must howl like a wolf.  Animation.

 duction of atomic and hydrogen weapons, if they do not

 dU.
 Let us, we urge the leaders of the capitalist
 b                              states, prove
 in practice which system is the best. Let us compete without
 war. (Applause. Is that a bad         ?
 ,
 proposal        t,tter, sure,)
 )                         It is bettor', surely,
 than to say, let us compete and see - who produces the most

 annihilating human beings. AVh~
 b                     ~tt we propose is peaceful
 competition in raising the living standards
 ~            of all peoples.
 W e stand, and always shall
 stand, for such com etiti
 p    on as
 will help to promote the prosperity of the
 .         peoples, to
 raise
 their living standards. Therefore,
 g                        our proposals are very
 clear and comprehensible.
 They are comprehensible
 Y                     to all
 people. And I am sure that this clear and  ust
 J position of
 the Soviet Union is welcomed by the Indian people. But we
 must view things soberly and b        y     assess the situation correctly.

 buffalo to feed on meat, nor the tiger to feed on grass. (.lnama-

 to be suspected of propaganda. I think you understand
 ~                   it.
 (Animation and applause.)
 Friends, we have put    r
 ,            foiti~ard tier clear
 proposals on disar-
 mament. The Ilavor    r
 of your city pointed y pited out here that  like a number of other for-
 eign countries, still lacks objective information about our
 life about the specific aspects of our economic social and
 political  system.
 For instance it is asked: why is there only one party in
 the  U.S.S.R.? This  question  evidently springs  from a
 lack of understanding g of the fundamentals of our socialist
 society.
 As you know, it is in the nature of the bourgeois class
 state to have many Parties; Parties reflect and uphold the
 interests of their respective classes and each class naturally
 has a party of its own. In the Soviet Union, as a result
 of the victory of socialism an entirely new, socialist society
 has been established, in which there are no antagonistic
 classes no groups whose interests might clash and conflict.

 Today we have a homogeneous society, a society which is
 strong by virtue of its unity and solidarity.
 Pre-revolutionary, tsarist Russia had many parties.
 There was a party of the capitalists, a party of the land-
 which ambitiously called itself the
 lords, a kulak party                  ~
 Socialist-Revolutionary Party, and a party of the working
 class  the Bolshevik Party, founded by the great Lenin.
 the working class to the strug-
 This party was able to rally ~
 le against the capitalists and landlords, against the tsar-
 g                            b
 ist regime. It was able to secure the alliance of the working
 b
 class and the peasantry. This Party was able to win to the
 side of the working class the progressive intelligentsia, arid
 under its leadership the Great October Socialist Revolution
 was carried out  the exploiting classes were defeated and
 abolished  and a new, socialist society was built. Now the
 Soviet people are successfully building a communist society.
 Whom could a party of capitalists and landlords represent
 today in the Soviet Union? We have no capitalists or land-
 lords, and hence the question of having such a party cannot
 even arise. Whom could a kulak party represent today in our
 country? With the establishment of the collective-farmsYs-
 tern, we put an end for ever to the old economic system in
 the countryside which daily and hourly gave rise to capital-
 ism. Our young people today know about the kulaks only
 from books and from the accounts of people of the older
 generation.
 Soviet society is a society           b of working PeoPle  of the
 workers, peasants and working intellectuals. As has been
 recorded in the Constitution of the U.S.S.R., the Commu-
 nist Party is the vanguard of the working people in their
 struggle for the construction of a communist society, the
 leading force of all the working people's organizations both
 public and state.
 Such is our society and such our system. We do not seek
 160
 to impose it upon anyone, on an gone, but, frankly speaking, we believe
 that it is the best system . There are people who try to make
 it appear as if the spread of communist ideas all over the
 world is the result of some sort of intrigues on the pare of
 knows that long before the
 the U.S.S.R., yet everybody                b
 October Revolution communism existed in Europe and the
 communist doctrine founded by lblarx and Engels had struck
 by                       b
 root in the toiling masses.
 In this connection we would like to dwell also on another
 question put to us  by l some correspondents-concerning
 the Information Bureau of Communist Parties, or Comin-
 form, as it is sometimes called. The activities of this organ-
 ization to which the Communist Parties of a number of
 European countries belong and `whose aim it is to exchange
 ~
 information and experience in the struggle of the working
 class for emancipation, worry all those who would like to
 perpetuate the old system of exploitation of man by man,
 which has outlived its time.
 Sometimes the question is put thus: Is there no way of
 abolishing the Cominform? But, after all, why should the
 Communist Parties deprive themselves of this generally
 accepted form of international contact and co-operation?
 Why,for instance, do those who seek the abolition of the
 Cominform  not  object to the activities of  the Socialist
 International, which unites the Social-Democratic Parties?
 WT~I'y should they ld 'he,           it natural and  legitimate for
 ~ ~ consider
 capitalists to unite in international monopoly combines and
 meet regularly in order jointly to transact their business,
 while denying the working class the right to give effect to
 b           ~
 the great slogan of international solidarity, "Workers of
 ~
 all countries, unite!" Proclaimed by Marx and Engels and
 corresponding to the vital interests of all the working people?
 b                                   b
 We have always stood and always will stand for the
 strengthening and development of international co-operation

 working AeoA                                b le, and in the struggle for peace.
 The Communist Parties, which stand guard over the
 interests of the working class and all working people, fol-
 low low the most progressive arid humane of all teachings-
 the teaching of Marxism-Leninism, the application of which
 in the Soviet Union, the Chinese People's Republic and the
 People's Democracies has so brilliantly proved its worth.
 This teaching is spreading more and more over the whole
 world. We are against any "export of revolution," as Lenin
 said, for to speak of anything of the kind would be unscien
 -

 triumph over old, outdated ideas. Thus it has always been,
 thus it will be in the development of human society.

 Mr. Prime Minister, friends,
 The time has come for us to leave your hospitable land.

 impressions we have obtained in the course of our eventful

 b                                                                b

 friendly           b feelings for the Soviet Union. We shall tenderly
 cherish these friendly
 feelings in our hearts.
 In the course of our visit we have seen something  of
 b
 India's past, the unforgettable monuments of your ancient
 culture, created by the skilled hands of Indian craftsmen.
 We have seen your present too-Your towns and rural
 localities, and the efforts which the people and the Govern-
 ment of India are devoting to the development of your in-
 and agriculture.
 dustry       ;~

 .
 with Mr. Nehru and other members of the Government of

 Dear friends,
 a few minutes we shall leave th
 In                              the capital of the country
 of the great Indian people.
 The reception we have been accorded by the Government
 and the people of India has been exceptionally warm and
 cordial. I wish once again to express iiiY gratitude ratitude and ap-
 red ation to the esteemed Prime Minister of India, Mr.
 p
 Nehru, the President of the Republic of India, Mr. Prasad
 ,
 the Government of India and the great Indian people for
 b
 the courtesy                             b and kindness shown us throughout our stay - in
 India.
 In the course of our visits to the different towns and
 states of India we constantly heard many kind, ardent words
 about the friendship between our peoples.
 lhjs friendship
 will continue to grow ever stronger, for it is surely one of
 b             ~
 the sources of strength for world peace.
 We are ha     that our visit to the Republic of
 happy                                    India
 161
 has served this noble cause. But our trip and our talks with
 the leaders of India would not have yielded such tangible
 and valuable results had we not met with the necessary un-
 derstanding on the part of our Indian friends.
 The identity of the views of India and the Soviet Union
 on the further strengthening of friendship between our two
 b
 countries and on major international issues has found ex-
 pression in the Joint Soviet-Indian Declaration signed yester-
 day. Dear friends, when Mr. Nehru, on the termination of
 his tour of the Soviet Union, took leave of our country . and
 its people he said that he had left a part of his heart in our
 ~
 country. And . now as we take leave of you, of the great
 people of India, 1 realize how true  are these simple but
 profound words. Part of my Heart, too, will remain here in
 India. And in my  Heart there has grown  and  become
 firmly rooted an ardent love for India and her people. We
 are happy to havegaired so many great, good friends here;
 we are happy that the friendship between our two countries
 has become stronger than ever.
 b
 . Never has the friendship of our peoples and countries been
 darkened by enmity or conflict. And we are deeply convinced
 that it never will be. We shall do everything thing in our power
 to foster the friendship between the peoples of our coun-
 tries so that it may y be eternal and unbreakable.
 Good-bye, dear friends! Till we meet  again!

 t  we invited the Burmese
 ernmen,
 On behalf of our Gov
 and the Minister of Industry,
 Minister of Defence, U Ba Swe,
 U Kti raw Nvein, to visit the Soviet Union. Both Ministers
 accepted the invitation.
 Special mention should be made of our meetings and con-
 versations with U Nu, Prime Minister of the Union of Burma,
 W11iCh  were marked by cordiality and friendship. These
 .
 resulted in the Soviet-Burmese Declaration signed
 meetings

 The Declaration notes the identity of the vie\~s of the
 two countries an the major international problems requiring
 settlement  disarm am             ~ ent  including prohibition of atomic

 lie in relation to
 ig  the C.P.R. its rightful place in the
 question of granting                   b
 United Nations.
 The two Governments reaffirmed their unanimous opinion
 that the policy of forming  blocs is to be condemned, and
 that only a policy of non-participation in such blocs can
 establish confidence and good will among states. "Interna-
 tional peace," the Soviet-Burmese Declaration says, "can
 be strengthened and the peoples' confidence in the future
 g
 can be assured, not through the creation of blocs but only
 joint and collective efforts of all peoples."
 through
 The views of the two Governments were also found to
 concur on the results of the Geneva Conference of the Four
 heads of Government, and of the recent Conference of the
 Four Foreign Ministers. 'rhe Soviet-Burmese Declaration of
 December 6 states that the two countries consider that
 further efforts should be made to solve outstanding g inter-
 national problems.
 Our relations with Burma rest on a firm foundation,
 in maintaining
 .  interested
 since both parties are vitally
 198
 aiid furthering co-operation on the basis of the Vivo Princi-
 ples of peaceful co-existence.
 Our economic relations with the Union of Burma are
 based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and
 other shackling condi-
 preclude imposing political or any                                 b
 Lions by either party. In full conformity with these principles,
 which are shared by the Burmese Government, we discussed
 during our stay y in Rangoon measures for furthering Soviet-
 ,
 Burmese co-operation in the economic, cultural, scientific
 articular, for enlarging the
 and technical spheres, and, in p                                        b    ;~

 of several industrial enterprises in Burma. Burma, in re-
 turn, will sell the Soviet Union rice, and in the event of the
 quantities purchased being  insufficient to compensate for
 the value of our deliveries, Burma will enjoy the right to
 credit> that is to defer the payments in kind over a number
 of years by mutual agreement.
 In token of good will and respect for the people of the
 b
 Union of Burma, we offered on behalf of the Soviet Govern-
 melt> and on its instructions, to build and equip, with So-
 viet means and resources, a technological institute in Ran-
 b
 goon as a gift to the Burmese people. (Prolonged applause.

 The Government of the Union of Burma highly appreci-
 ated the motives which prompted the Soviet Government to
 make this offer, and accepted the gift with deep gratitude
 to the Soviet Government and the Soviet people. (Ap-

 Soviet  Union,  we  accepted  this  gift  with  ggratitude.
 I
 (Applause.)
 A strong desire for cultural intercourse with the Soviet
 b
 Union is manifested by the Burmese leaders and Burmese
 intellectuals. We declared that the Soviet Union was ready
 to develop cultural intercourse with Burma, since this could
 but benefit the two countries and help        b
 to strengthen their
 friendly relations.
 The Government of Burma expressed satisfaction with
 the good will displayed by the Soviet Government in fe
 b         .,
 Ranbgoon talks. We, on our part, wish the Union of Burma
 that it may speedily cope with the aftermath of colonial
 oppression and war devastation, consolidate and unite the
 Burmese  eo le, and achieve further success in building
 endent of foreign states  and free of the

 ~
 difficulties it is still experiencing owing to the efforts of
 b
 certain foreign powers to place Burma at a disadvantage in
 the world market.
 The peoples of the Soviet Union and Burnia are unani-
 mous in the desire to preserve and consolidate peace, to
 safeguard the security of nations, and to Iproniote inter-
 b                                    .,
 natioiial co-operation and friendship. The visit of Comrade
 Klirushchov and myself to Burma as the guests of her Govern-
 ~
 merit,  and our meetings with the Burmese people, have
 brought the Soviet Union and Burma still closer. Th friend-
 ship and co-operation between the two countries is becoming
 a factor of increasing importance in the effort to relax
 international tension.
 We shall do everything in our power to strengthen and
 ~
 broaden the friendship and co-operation between the two
 countries for the well-beinb g and happiness of their peoples.
 i)rolonged applause.
 I shall now turn to our visit to Afghanistan.
 b
 It would be difficult to exaggerate the importance and re-
 200
 suits of our stay     ~ in Afghanistan as the guests of His Majesty's
 Government. The Soviet Union and Afghanistan have a
 b
 common border of 2,346 kilometres , and the two countries
 relations of long g standing.
 are bound by close and friendly                        ,.,
 The Afghan people won their national independence in
 bitter struggle against the British imperialists, who sought
 to convert Afghanistan into their colony. The courageous
 b
 Afghans were thrice victorious in this struggle, and in '1919
 b they firmly established their independence and statehood.
 A big g role in establishing Afghanistan's independence was
 b
 by the defeat suffered by the intervention troops
 played
 ill Central Asi a at the hands of Soviet Russia.
 Afghanistan has invariably enjoyed the support of the
 Soviet Union. We were the first power to recognize Afghan-
 istan as a sovereign state, in 1919. Afghanistan, on the
 other hand, was one of the first foreign countries to recognize
 the Soviet state established by the Great October Socialist
 Revolution. These facts suffice to show how deeply rooted
 are the good relations between the two countries. Experience
 has shown that these good-neighbourly relations are in the
 b
 best interests of the peoples of the two countries.
 Our meetings in Kabul with His Majesty King g Mohammed
 Zahir Shah, Prime Minister Mohammed Daoud and other
 leading Afghan statesmen revealed their desire to maintain
 and develop           b the good-neibghbour)Y relations between the
 two countries.
 This desire of His Majesty's Government of Afghanistan
 is only to be welcomed  as we said in Kabul. On its part,
 the Soviet Government has done, and intends in the future
 to strengthen and develop our
 to do  everything necessary        b
 relations with this neighbouring country.  Applause.)

 Member of the Presidium of the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet
 ,
 and the visit to the Soviet Unicn
 of the Prime Minister of
 India, Jawaharlal Nehru provided them with the oPPortu-
 riity of making personal acquaintance
 11 it11 the peoples of
 these countries and their Way of lifo                               with the problems,
 achievements, and aspirations of              ,
 each counLl   and led t
 3r         to
 mutual understanding between
 ~           them and the peoples of
 their respective states, based on
 ,           mutual respect, good will
 and tolerance.
 The  above-mentioned  Joint
 Statement   ublish
 p      eel  on
 June 22, 1955, expressed their film adherence to the Five
 e l,ivc,
 Principles also known as Pa ris li
 Slcala.
 These Princi les proclaim that countries differing from
 one another politically, ssocially and             ,
 y                        economically can and
 must co-operate on the basis of mutual respect, and non-
 interference in one another's home affairs  and must abide
 by the policy of active and
 Y     r        peaceful co-existence  in the
 common desire to attain the ideals of
 peace and the improve-
 ment of living conditions.
 Since these Five Principles ~r
 were proclaimed a number
 of countries have adhered to
 or expressed their agreement
 with,  them.  The countries
 represented at  the Bandung
 Conference unanimously adopted a Declamation confirming
 ~
 these Principles, which b.av
 e now won general i?eC0gnit loll
 as a solid basis for co-operation between countries.
 During the  resent visit of N. A. I3u1 anin and 1\           S
 Khrushchov to India a free and frank exchange of opinion
 on problems of the iliternation 1
 a situation took place between
 them and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. This
 exchange of opinion bore ot t their firm conviction that in-
 ternational relations must be based on the Five
 Princip1CS
 and that everything must, be done to ease international
 tension and promote the consolidation of peace and inter-
 national co-operation.

 The Four Heads of
 Government Conference in Geneva in
 July 1955 resulted in the recognition b
 by the Great Powers
 represented there of the
 senselessness of war, wwhich owing
 to the development of
 atomic and hydrogen weapons can
 bring only calamities to mankind. This fundamental admis-
 sion that war must be ruled e                                                                                                     ed out as a method
 ofsettling in-
 ternational disputes was received with deep satisfaction p          onby
 the peoples of the world and resulted in
 a substantial relax-
 ation of international
 tension. Although basic problems
 of Europe and Asia sti1
 1 remain unsolved,
 the natural con-
 sequence of excluding ? war
 as a method of settling out-
 standing questions was
 a change in the a
 pproath to them
 and the striving to sole
 b        e them through negotiations.
 Dip-
 lomatic relation   were
 s u ere established  between
 the Soviet
 Union and the German Federal RePwhite   Negotiations
 were started and are still continuing nb on an ambassadorial
 level between the United States of America        ~ '
 and the ~hlIleS@
 People's Republic.. The conference on the uses of atomic
 energy for peaceful
 purposes successfully concluded   its
 work this August and the U.N. General Assembly passed
 a resolution on the setting u
 b  p of an International
 Atomic
 Energy Agency.
 In order to continue the
 settlement of outstanding ques-
 tions through  negotiations,
 the hour Heads of
 Govern-
 ment Conference held in Geneva last July pointed to the
 necessity of convening a Conference of Foreign illiiilster
 b S
 of the respective countries. This conference was recently
 held in Geneva. It did n           ,
 of  reach any agreement on
 Y  b             the
 problems discussed  therefore the great hopes which
 had
 appeared as a result of the Four Heads of Government
 Conference have so far not materialized. The conference
 however, contributed to   ~ a clearer understanding of the Prob-
 lenls facing the world
 g          ,and  it  is an indisputable fac
 t that all
 these problems can be soI
 ved only by peaceful method

 through peaceful negotiations if war is to be excluded as
 b  _
 it should be according to the general oPinion. Therefore,
 disappointment  over the results of the Geneva Foreign
 and  it is
 Ministers' Conference can  be only temporary
 necessary to continue to exert every effort to ease inter-
 national tension  considering negotiations to be the sole
 method  of  settling  outstanding  issues.  The  statesmen
 b
 of both countries express their hope that the negotiations
 on an ambassadorial   level between the United States of
 America and the Chinese People's Republic will lead not
 only y to the  solution  of the questions under discussion,

 but also to greater mutui                                               b
 ences at a higher  level. They are convinced that durable

 People's Republic its legitimate place in the United Nations.
 in recognizing this
 They express deep p regret at the delay       ~           b
 indisputable fact. They       ~ sincerel y hope that other Far East-
 em                      and Asian + problems will be speedily solved through

 be satisfied and the Korean question solved on the basis
 of recognition f recognition of the national rights of the Korean people
 and              ~ in conformity with the interests of peace in the Far East.
 The statesmen of the U.S.S.R. and the Prime 1Vliriister
 of India expressed satisfaction with the Geneva Conference
 on Indo-China held last year. That conference put an end
 to the destructive war in Judo-China and outlined the pro-
 cedure for settling the problems of the Indo-China states.
 They note with regref that obstacles are being raised to
 the implementation of the Geneva agreements for Viet-
 Nam and that there are also difficulties in implementing
 the Geneva agreements on Laos. Violation of these agree-
 ments will have exceedingly grave consequences both for

 reduction of conventional armaments           '
 and an effective in-
 ternational control to ensure the strict implementation of
 such prohibition and disarmament. Until
 this is achieved the
 whole world will be darkened and depressed by the fear of
 J
 war and the peoples will doubt the sincerity of the desire for
 peace.
 The statesmen of the U.S.S.R. and r   the Prime Minister
 of India have agreed that the forming o'
 b                      of military alliances
 or regional military blocs is not a means of     o
 ~                          safeguarding
 peace and security. Such alliances have extended the bounds
 of the "cold war" and have introduced the element of in-
 stability                                    the areas in
 Y                 question, have increased fear and
 tension and raised additional obstacles
 to the peaceful de-
 velo1pment of the countries concerned. Peace and genuine
 security of the peoples can be assured only b  the collective
 efforts of states.
 One of the most effective                          ng
 means of reduciii   fear and
 international tension is to eliminate barriers
 to mutual
 co-operation and understanding. For this
 b            purpose cultural
 and economic relations between countries s11UouUU be Cll(;Util'-
 aged. The statesmen of both countries noted with sans-
 faction the ever-increasing ? opportunities  for                            the  peoples
 of both countries to get to know
 each other better through
 the regular exchange of visits by scientists, technical ex-
 perts,  economists,  members  of     parliament  writers and
 other cultural workers of both countries. They hone that.
 there will be a steady extension of such opportunities
 for
 mutual  contacts on a basis facilitating understanding of
 and respect for the different ways of life in the two coun-
 tries.
 The Chairman of the
 U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers,
 the Member of the Presidium of the U.S.S.R. Supreme So-
 viet and the Prime Minister of
 India, therefore, welcome the
 development of co-operation between  the two  countries
 256
 in building he
 Bhllai iron
 and Steel Works in India and
 in  carrying out other projects
 on which nebotiati
 ons are
 already  being conducted. India's second five-year plan,
 which devotes main attention to the development
 of heav
 iiidustl can offer                                         y
 industry,         further
 possibilities for such CO -
 rl Operatio.
 They consider it desirable that upon completion of the nec-
 essary  preliminary  work                                                                                                              competent  representatives of
 both  couiltri
 es meet to examine mutually       advantageous
 forms of economic and technical
 co-operation and to reach
 agreement on concrete matters in cases when this is deemed
 necessary.
 The visit of

 India, with Burma and Afghanistan
 ill working for  ending peace,        the "cold war and securing fur-

 pension. The identity of
 the aims and aspirations of these countries in relation to
 the fundamental  robie
 p     m of international life-the preser-
 vation and consolidation  of peace-has been reaffirmed.

 Afghanist an is explained not b  transitory causes it i
 by                              is the
 result of their common fundamental interests as countries
 vJiic1i desire international
 peace and security.
 r
 the talks revealed an identity of views on major aspects
 of the relations between these countries, also 011 SUCK Cardi-
 nal in
 ternational problems as disarmament
 and uncondition-
 al prohibition of atomic and          o
 weapons, h ~dro en           satisfying
 ~ b the lawful rights of the Chinese People's Republic in rela-

 granting
 the Chi-
 nese People's Republic its ribghtf
 ul place in the United Na-
 tions and settling other outstanding Asian and Far Eastern
 problems in accordance with the leboin
 mate rights of the
 iiations.
 Of great importance is their unanimous agreement that
 peace cati be safeguarded only b   collective efforts of the
 states.
 The relations between the Soviet, Union and India Burma
 and Afghanistan are based on the principles of mutual respect,
 for each others territorial integrity                  o
 and sovereignty, non-
 aggression , non-interference in each other's i
 nteinal affairs,
 equality and mutual benefit and

 Conference and by a number of other countries in Europe
 and Asia. Adoption of these principles as the bans of the
 relations between all countries would be of enormous impor-
 tance foi establishing the necessary confidence among na-
 tions
 tions and removing the threat of a new war.
 Another important result of the visit of Comrades Bulganin
 and Khrushchov to these Asian countries is the agreements
 reached with them for expanding trade  economic cultural
 and other relations, based on the principle of equality and
 mutual benefit, and without imposing any obligations of
 a political or military nature.

 their         with each other's life  achievements and peoples                                  is aiic cul-
 ture, and broader interchange of experience.
 Identity of the interests of the U.S.S.R.  the Republic
 ,~ of India, the Union of Burma Afghanistan and of all other
 peace-loving states in the matter of ensuring peace and
 national independence of the peoples creates the necessary
 conditions for the development of firm and enduring friend-
 ship                                  b between these countries, and for growth of co-opera-
 tion between them, for the benefit of their peoples and in
 the interests of universal peace.

 Burma and Afghanistan evoked the whole-hearted approval
 of the peoples of many countries, especially colonial and de-
 pendent countries  and was hailed led
 s  ai    by all who are sincerely
 interested in eliminating the danger of war and in firm and
 b
