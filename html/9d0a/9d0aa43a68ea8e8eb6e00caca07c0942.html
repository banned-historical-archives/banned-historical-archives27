 24 May 1965
 Briefly Noted 000,
 Bankrupt     Fidel Castro Sel
 Economy      Heirlooms
 Cuban refugee groups
 are continuing their
 efforts to prevent Fidel Castro
 from selling art objects which he
 confiscated when they fled their
 homes to escape living tinder his
 Communist dictatorship.
 Reports from Milan (NYTimes
 and Press Comment May 12) say that a
 shipment of the paintings, silver,
 bronzes, porcelain and other heir-
 looms has arrived, is blocked in a
 warehouse there, but has been paid
 for by a Milan art dealer.  This
 represents about a quarter of the,
 estimated total two million dollars
 of the "Treasure of Fidel Castro"
 sent to European countries for sale.
 The Cuban Government has been
 hard pressed to meet deficits accu-
 mulated over the years from a dete-
 riorating economy and from excessive
 borrowing and spending for military
 establishments and aggressive-sub-
 version throughout Latin America.
 Selling family heirlooms is the
 last resort of the impoverished be-
 fore bankruptcy is admitted.  Sym-
 pathy is also due the Cuban people
 and future generations for the loss
 of this part of their cultural heri-
 tage which is being thrown away so
 wantonly.
 Communists    Sino-Soviet Conflict
 Expose Their  Continues in Youth Front
 Fronts in
 Africa        Chicom attacks on the
 Soviets at youth meet-
 ings increasingly reveal the extent
 to which the World Federation of
 Democratic Youth (WFDY) is subordi-
 nate to Moscow.                                                                        The latest series
 of incidents occurred at the WFDY
 Executive Committee meeting in Accra
 (15-21 April) before an audience of
 over 100 delegates from 56 countries.
 Ironically' the Chicoms say what non-
 Communists have always maintained,
 that WFDY is an instrument of Soviet
 foreign policy.  Going one step fur-
 ther, the Chicoms even described
 WFDY's current designed-in-Moscow-
 objectives as opposing China rather
 than imperialism.
 Using WFDY as a whipping boy,
 the Chicoms took the Soviets to task
 on several counts, especially Viet-
 nam.                                                                           A previously approved IUS (In-
 ternational Union of Students)/WFDY
 statement was condemned as a "peace-
 ful political solution" that appeases
 the U.S. when what the Vietnamese
 want is American troop withdrawal.
 The conference resolution on Vietnam
 was branded a "trick" and its passage
 rejected on grounds of Soviet voting
 manipulation.  Although TASS failed
 to report a Sino-Soviet clash, the
 Soviets retaliated by implying that
 the Chicoms have been interfering
 with shipments of Soviet military aid
 to North Vietnam -- which the Chicoms
 flatly denied.

 (Briefly Noted Cont.)
 Approved For Release 1999/08/4   I -  P78-03061A000300030004-3
 The Chicoms were equally vo-
 ciferous on  other issues, notably
 an amendment condemning peaceful co-
 existence and the United Nations,
 but to no immediate avail.  Although
 the Chicoms drew their usual support
 from delegations representing North
 Korea, Indonesia, Japan, North Viet-
 nam and the NLFSV, they gained Afri-
 can backing only from Congo (Brazza-
 ville) and the Federation des Etudi-
 ants d'Afrique Noire en France.  A
 WFDY press release asserts that the
 majority of the resolutions (not yet
 published) were adopted unanimously;
 it does not spell out the apparent
 isolation of the Chicoms on key is-
 sues.
 The resolutions of the African
 youth leadership seminar (20-23
 April, sponsored by the Ghana Young
 Pioneers) echoed the stance taken by
 the WFDY executive committee session.
 This sequel of events, billed to fo-
 cus on Africa (i.e., the forthcoming
 World Youth Festival, the first in
 Africa, to be held in Algiers in Ju-
 ly; future WFDY activities among Af-
 rican youth struggling against colo-
 nialism), offered both the Soviets
 and the Chicoms an opportunity to
 advance their aspirations in Africa.
 To the Soviet chagrin, the Chicoms
 were very active in corridor poli-
 ticking among African delegations,
 attacking Soviet direction of the
 WFDY for hindering the anti-colo-
 nial struggle of African youth, and
 suggesting Afro-Asian solidarity to
 resist the WFDY.  On the conference
 floor they reinforced their case by
 denigrating Soviet suppression of
 the 4 March anti-U.S. demonstration
 by foreign students in Moscow.
 Preparations for impending ma-
 jor events in other front organiza-
 tions indicate that the Sino-Soviet
 conflict, as it appeared at this
 WFDY gathering, will be epide
 mid-summer.
 Life in a      Memoirs of a Soviet
 Concentration  General
 Camp
 In March, April, and
 May of 1964, the so-
 viet literary journal Novy Mir pub-
 lished the memoirs of General Alek-
 sandr Vasilyevich Gorbatov, a vet-
 eran not only of two World Wars and
 the Civil War, but also of Stalin's
 prison camps of Kolyma and Magadan.
 Gorbatov was one of those enlisted
 veterans of the Czar's army whose
 military experience and native abil-
 ity enabled them to rise rapidly in
 the new Red Army, which was then
 fighting the Whites and the Poles.
 His career continued to go well un-
 til.  1938, when he was arrested
 during Stalin's purge of the mili-
 tary leadership.  He tells us that
 he refused to confess to crimes he
 had not committed, and that he also
 refused to implicate others.  Un-
 like most of his unfortunate com-
 rades, he was released and rein-
 stated in his old rank in March 1941,
 thanks in large part to the inter-
 vention of Marshal Budyenny on his
 behalf.  He made a good record for
 himself in World War II, rising to
 the post of Army Commander.  His sto-
 ry is very well told, with a stark
 description of NKVD interrogations
 and of conditions in the camps.
 Gorbatov also tells many stories of
 military skirmishes and command con-
 flicts, as well as of his boyhood
 experiences.  There are two English
 editions, entitled Black Years (Lon-
 don: Flegon Press, 197) and Years
 Off Icy Life (London: Constable, 1964);
 there is also an American edition

 Hospitals        If You Disagree,
 Replace          You're Insane
 Stalin's Camps
 The ideal totalitar-
 ian regime would not
 use firing squads and rubber hoses;
 it would use other methods which,
 leaving their victims physically
 unscarred, rob them of any feeling
 of self-respect, any will to resist.
 This ideal, described fictionally in
 Orwell's 1984 and Koestler's Darkness
 at Noon, and approached in Chinese
 Communist brainwashing, inspires the
 post-Stalin treatment of those Soviet
 citizens who criticize the regime.
 Instead of sending them to prison
 camps as "politicals," the KGB now
 puts them in a mental hospital.  After
 all, from the one-dimensional stand-
 point of the blindly doctrinaire Com-
 munist, a Soviet citizen who doesn't
 like Communism must be insane.
 On 2 May 1965, the London Observ-
 er published the first of three in-
 stallments of excerpts from a new au-
 tobiographical novel by Valeriy Tarsis:
 Ward 7.  This sensational story de-
 scribes the experiences of a political
 prisoner, nominally a patient, con-
 fined in a Soviet mental hospital.  As
 noted i             in this issue, Tar-
 sis and several others are known to
 have been confined in mental hospitals
 for political reasons.  In 1960, Tar-
 sis had smuggled out another manu-
 script, The Bluebottle, sharply at-
 tacking the Soviet regime, and this
 led to his confinement for two years
 in the hospital he describes.  The
 Bluebottle was carried out by an
 Italian newspaper correspondent, pos-
 sibly the inspiration for Signor Mario
 Gozzi in The Fall of the Jesuit (see
 attachment to               25X1 C10b
 The Ward 7 manuscript has like-
 wise been smuggled out.  It is being
 published in Russian in Grany, an ex-
 ile publication in West Germany, and
 Collins and Harvill of London pub-
 lished the full translation in book
 form on 10 May.  The three Observer
 installments appeared in Press Com-
 ment on 13, 17 and 20 May.

 Countering the
 SOVIET CAMPAIGN on WORLD WAR II
 Twentieth anniversaries of events ending World War II
 are being used by the USSR in a campaign to increase
 its stature.  The Soviets are claiming credit, inter
 alia, for defeating the fascists while attempting to
 grossly discredit the motives and actions of the
 western allies and particularly the United States.
 Rewriting history, an ingrained habit of the Communists
 to make facts fit their constantly changing posture,
 is one of the techniques being used in their campaign.
 A pamphlet, Moscow Interprets World War Two:  How the
 Soviets Falsify History, illustrates how the Soviets
 rewrite history for propaganda purposes.  It analyzes
 the methods used in Grigorii Deborin's THE SECOND WORLD
 WAR, and also shows the ordinary reader how to recognize
 distortions and questionable statements in such "history
 books."

 PROPAGANDIST'S GUIDE to COMMUNIST DISSENSIONS
 #53                        Commentary          28 April-11 May 1965
 Principal Developments:
 1.  Communist parties, states, and media during this period are heavily
 concerned with the continuing warfare in Vietnam, the new crisis in the
 Dominican Republic, the annual May Day celebrations, and the 20th anniver-
 saries of the "great victory of the forces of socialism over fascism"  and
 the "liberation" of East Germany and Czechoslovakia.  The Soviets, basking
 in the glory of their almost-single-handed (according to Communist accounts)
 triumph, calmly reiterate their adherence to the "general line" formulated
 by the "20th, 21st, and 22nd Congresses and the Party Program."
 2.  The Chinese, however, use the anniversaries to strike hard at the
 "Jirushchev revisionists" in.three major articles, in Rec! Flag Nos. 4 & 5
 and in People's Daily on 9 May.  They also revive the campaign against
 "brutal Soviet suppression of anti-U.S. student demonstrators," publicizing:
 (a  an inflammatory Chinese Foreign Ministr  note of 13 April to the SovGovt
 referring back to the   March Moscow affair, -- which the Soviets returned
 without reply; (b) a "recent" letter to Pravda by 12 Vietnamese students in
 Moscow denouncing an "eyewitness report" of the 4 March demonstration by
 Soviet citizens which Pravda had published 13 March, -- with a demand that
 Pravda "publish a correction of these falsehoods immediately"; and  c) a
 lurid account of an entirely new case of "savage" Soviet repression of an
 attempted anti-U.S. demonstration on   Apr I in Leningrad by a large number
 of Vietnamese students.  The Chinese also  d  ostentatiously publicize re-
 ports of several anti-revisionist materials appearing several weeks ago in'
 organs of the pro-Chinese dissident "CP of Australia (M-L)" and the Chinese-
 aligned CP of New Zealand; (e) describe another fierce struggle with Soviet
 manipulators at an April WFDY Executive meeting in Accra see also Briefly
 Noted); and (f) accuse the Soviets of an "act of sabotage and split" in an
 exhibit beginning 3 days before the opening of the AAPSO meeting scheduled
 for 10 May in Accra (Winneba).
 3.  Analysts believe that the wording of the 1965 Sino-Soviet trade
 protocol, signed in Moscow 29 April, indicates a further decline in total
 trade levels, in contrast to increases in Chinese trade agreements with all
 East European countries except Bulgaria.
 4.  North Vietnamese statements continue to show far more moderation
 than the Chinese and an apparent desire to maintain good relations with the
 Soviets.
 5.  The Pajetta-led Italian CP delegation is reportedly receiving a
 warm welcome in Hanoi, where Nan Dhan. publishes "warm and sincere thanks"

 (Commentary cont.)
 Approved For Release 1         .~TRDP78-03061 A000300030004-3
 for Italian "valuable support."  In contrast, NCNA's report of the delega-
 tion's 1-day stop-over in Peking indicates no warmth or agreement.
 6.  Beyond the 1 May NYTimes account included in our Chronology, there
 have been several clandestine reports to the effect that Castro's regime is
 shifting significantly away from a Chinese orientation toward the Soviets.
 7.  Diplomatic observers speculate on some evidence that the Czech
 regime may be about to move toward Rumanian-style independence.  Top-level
 Rumanian representation in Prague for the  `liberation' anniversary -- in
 contrast to the CPSU and other parties which sent their senior delegations
 to East Berlin -- seems to harmonize with Novotny's declaration of intent
 to improve relations specifically with the Chinese and Albanians.
 8.  The brief published reports of a meeting of representatives of
 West European CPs in Brussels to discuss preparations for a summit meeting
 of all in accordance with French CP initiative (see Chrono, April 18-24)
 are confirmed by clandestine reporting, which says that 13 parties were
 represented in Brussels and the summit will probably be held early June.
 A subsequent report cites "Stockholm sources" to the effect that represent-
 atives of the 4 Scandinavian CPs meeting there around the 1st of May were
 unable to agree on a joint attitude toward the French-sponsored meeting.
 Significance :
 While the Soviets, riding the crest of Communist 20th anniversary
 celebrations of their great triumph over fascism, confine themselves to
 calm, confident reiteration of their Khrushchevian line, the Chinese in-
 tensify their anti-Soviet polemics in a series of strident, new attacks
 hammering away at the "Khrushchev revisionists," Soviet falsification of
 history, sham anti-imperialism, sham support of national liberation, and
 real "Soviet-U.S. cooperation for domination of the world."  In renewing
 their old campaign against "brutal Soviet suppression of anti-U.S. student
 demonstrators," they concentrate on the Vietnamese aspect, even reporting
 an alleged new incident in Leningrad involving only Vietnamese victims.
 However, the North Vietnamese leadership, presumably a chief target
 of the Chinese polemics, continues to demonstrate a determined resistance
 to being too closely identified with the Chinese.  Particularly significant
 is their reportedly warm welcome to the Pajetta-led delegation from the
 Italian CP, in the face of past Chinese scathing denunciation of the PCI
 and apparently cool treatment given the  Italians in Peking en route in
 contrast to the obvious Soviet favor demonstrated during tYeir Moscow stop-
 over.
 Bitter public Sino-Soviet battling may be anticipated at a number of
 forthcoming international meetings.  As reported herein, the Chinese have
 already accused the Soviets of "an act of sabotage and split" before the
 opening of the Accra AAPSO meeting due to get under way as this period
 closes. Other major events will be the 2nd ("Bandung") Conference of

 Two other developments bear watching:  the possible Czech move toward
 closer identification with the Rumanians and their independent stance; the

 CHRONOLOGY -- COiv 1UNIST DISSE'ITSIO S
 #53
 28 April-11 May 1965
 Continuing from April 2:  The Italian CP delegation headed by Pajetta
 (see #51 & #52 for earlier reports  arrives in Hanoi on the 30th, after
 a 1-day stop in Peking is reported by INNCNA on the 29th.  The NCNA report
 indicates that the Italians did not meet any top-level CCP figures and
 says only that "both sides elaborated their own vie-us on the Vietnam
 question."  However, PCI daily L'Unita on 1 May claims    that the delega-
 tion flew from Canton to Hanoi 'inn a Chinese plane made especially avail-
 able" to them.  The Italians are met at the Hanoi airport by "a large
 North Vietnamese Party delegation headed by Secretary Le Duan," and are
 received by Ho Chi Minh later the same day.  They are feature guests at
 Hanoi's May Day celebration and are reported as having "exchanged views
 on questions which interest both parties" in "a cordial and friendly
 atmosphere" with a Le Duan-led host delegation on the 3rd.  They are
 still reported as visiting museums and exhibitions on the 7th.  Mean-
 while, an editorial in daily Nhan Dan on the 3rd "extends the warm and
 sincere thanks of the Vietnamese people for the valuable support given
 them by the working class and other people of Italy in their national
 salvation struggle against U.S. aggression."
 April 18-24+:  Finnish CP daily Kansan Uutiset on 18th announces that
 Secretary Poikolainen will represent the Party at a meeting of West
 European CPs in Brussels 20 April to discuss pre2arations for a summit
 meeting of WE CPs.  French CP daily L'Humanite on the 24th reports that
 such a meeting had been held:  no date or place mentioned, but the re-
 port seems to confirm Brussels by quoting from a communique of the Belgian
 CP on the meeting.
 April 29:  Signing in Moscow of the 1965 Sino-Soviet trade protocol is
 announced:  no figures are given, but observers think that the wording
 suggests a further decline in total trade levels, -- in contrast to the
 announcements of China's 1965 trade agreements with the East European
 countries which (except for Bulgaria) explicitly mentioned plans for
 higher trade.
 April 29-30:  Two successive Pravda editorials pegged to May Day reiterate
 CPSU "unshakable" support of "the scientific nature of the Party's policy
 and its general political line ... expressed in the decisions of the
 20th, 21st, and 22nd Party Congresses and the CPSU Program."
 May 1:  May Day celebrations by the ruling CPs bring no surprises:
 they are generally somewhat subdued in favor of the impending 20th an-
 niversary of VE Day.
 A NYTTIies dispatch from Havana by Paul Hofmann reports that "the
 works of Mao Tse-tung have disappeared from the bookstore of the Cuban
 State Publishing Department, but writings by Nikita S. Khrushchev are

 still on display.  Referri.n3 to Castro's 13 March speech warning that
 his government would not tolerate the introduction of "the apple of
 discord" into the Eden of Cuban Communism, Hofmann writes "there are
 indications that the withdrawal of Mr. Mao's works may be a consequence
 of Cuban ideological vigilance."
 May2 :  NCNA reports on the 15-21 April Accra !,MY Ex. cutive; 33ceti  , which
 Mwas the scene of a fierce struggle between real and sham anti-imperialism,
 between real and sham unity."  The account bristles with Chinese charges
 of Soviet manipulation, tricks, calumny, and "extremely undemocratic means
 to force their capitulationist and splittist line upon others under the
 pretext of 'stopping polemics."' It states that the Soviet delegation was
 completely isolated in the voting for at least two items in the resolution:
 one a condemnation of U.S. crimes in the Congo, and the other a Rumanian
 demand that the draft resolution "firmly support the right of the peoples
 of all countries to run their own affairs without interference by foreign
 countries."
 May 3:  NCNA publicizes the text of an editorial on "The Great Victory
 of Leninism in Red Flag No. 4, published in April.  It recalls Chinese
 publication in 19 0  in commemoration of Lenin's 90th anniversary, of
 the three "Long Live Leninism" articles, in which, "although at that
 time we did not yet openly criticize Khrushchev and the leadership of
 the CPSU, the views expressed ... were the diametric opposite of the pack
 of nonsense dispensed by the K. revisionists This   aroused the livid
 hatred of the K. revisionists and scared the living daylights out of them."
 After reiterating their old line and their old charges on "the nature of
 imperialism," "peaceful coexistence," and "the national liberation move-
 ment," the Chinese say:
 "Thus, the facts of the past five years have mercilessly
 shattered the absuxd arguments of the modern revisionists.  After
 the fall of Khrushchev, which was a public proclamation of the
 bankruptcy of modern revisionism, we hoped that the new CPSU leader-
 ship would honestly and openly admit its mistakes and renounce the
 revisionist line and policies pursued when K was in power, and we
 advised them to do so.  However, contrary to the aspirations of the
 Soviet people and the revolutionary peoples of the world, the new
 CPSU leadership has taken over K revisionism as a priceless heritage
 and has continued to brandish it.  During the celebrations this year
 of the 95th anniversary of Lenin's birth, they still had the effron-
 tery to brag that 'the general line drafted in the 20th and 22nd
 Congresses of our Party and embodied in the Program of the CPSU'
 is a 'vivid indication' of a 'creative approach' to theory.  It was
 precisely in the name of a so-called 'creative approach' to Leninism
 that K actually renounced every fundamental thesis of Leninism, became
 the greatest revisionist in all history, and finally ended up in total
 bankruptcy.  Can his successors come to any better end?

 which "met with another se-':,back."  (This wotLI.d seem to be the same as
 the CPNZ statement on subject publicized by NCNA on 31 March, but the
 passages quoted are entirely different.)
 May 5-7:  The Chinese publicize a series of new developments and charges
 relating to Soviet s4 ression of anti-U.S., pro-Vietnam demonstrations.
 On the 5th, NCNA reports on a Chinese Foreign Ministry note to the Soviet
 Embassy dated 13 April protesting Soviet expulsion from the institutions
 where they were enrolled of the four Chinese students who went back to
 Peking "for medical treatment" after they had been "severely injured by
 Soviet troops and police" in the 4 March deiaMstration at the U.S. Embassy
 in Moscow.  The tone of the Chinese note.-is reflected in the following
 passage:
 "It is precisely clear that the real reason for the expulsion
 by the Soviet authorities ... is that the outrages committed by you
 in cracking down on the anti-American demonstration and persecuting
 the injured students were too ugly, that you are afraid that these
 students would expose the true facts of the entire incident upon
 their return to these institutions'fron their own country.  So you
 try to cover up your crime by expelling them from the institutions.
 In addition, you try, by this act of repression, to intimidate other
 students and prevent them from taking-part in anti-American activities
 in the future.  But all this is in.vnin....  The perverted actions
 of the Soviet Government will only expose once again its own true
 features of sham solidarity and sham anti-imperialism."
 Not surprisingly, "the Soviet Embassy actually returned the memorandum"
 to the Chinese FM on 20 April!
 On the 6th, NCNA reports on a "recent" letter to Pravda, "which to
 this day Pravda has not dared to publish,  by 12 Vietnamese students at
 the Institute of Geological Prospecting in Moscow "sternly refuting the
 distortion made by that paper concerning the Soviet authorities' repres-
 sion of the anti-U.S. demonstration staged by Asian, African, and Latin
 American students in Moscow on 4 March, and its shameless, slanderous
 attacks on these students."  The Vietnamese letter tells how "the Soviet
 Red Army surrounded ... (and) beat us" and claims that "75 Vietnamese
 students were wounded, 4 girls seriously."  It concludes:  We demand that
 you publish a correction of these falsehoods 5.  ediately," -- and shows
 codes sent to NCNA and VNA in addition to the original to Pravda.
 Also on the 6th, NCNA publicizes an entirely new charge that on
 3 April Soviet authorities "savagely suppressed Vietnamese students in
 Leningrad for their demand to hold an anti-U.S. rally."
 "In this incident, 82 Vietnamese students were arrested and
 wounded, among them 3 seriously (including one girl).  This was
 another shameful atrocity committed by Soviet authorities...."

 After describing Soviet "tricks" to try to prevent the Vietnamese
 from holding a 3 April anti-U.S. demonstration, for which the authorities
 on 1 April had granted peraission, NCNA describes how the Soviet authori-
 ties "suddenly rushed some 300 police to the scene and brutally cracked
 down on the Vietnamese students."
 "The Soviet police seized and tore up the placards inscribed
 with anti-U.S. slogans and the banners in the hands of the Vietnamese
 students.  They even went to such lengths as to trample under foot
 the national flags of the DRV."
 NCNA concludes with a paragraph sardonically asking the Soviet authorities
 how they can reconcile their "sweet-sounding words" about "practical sup-
 port"                          to the DRV with their "repeated suppression of foreign students who
 call for the holding of meetings and demonstrations against the U.S. agres-
 sors."
 "A person's words have to be judged by his deeds.  Obviously, the
 outrage perpetrated by the Soviet authorities in Leningrad exposed
 once against their sham anti-imperialism and sham support."
 NCNA reports on the 7th that People's Daily and other Peking papers
 devote a full page to the Vietnamese letter to Pravda and the above ac-
 count of Soviet suppression of the Vietnamese students in Leningrad, to-
 gether with pictures, including"a Soviet armyman seizing the national
 flag of the DRV from the hands of a Vietnamese student and unscrupulously
 trampling it under foot;' and another one"mercilessly manhandling a frail
 Vietnamese girl:'
 May 6 & 8:  NCNA reports on two anti-Soviet items appearing In recent
 issues of Vanguard, organ of the pro-Chinese dissident CP of Australia
 M-L .  On the 6th, NCNA tells of a Vanguard report (date not given  on
 the Chinese 23 March People's Daily/Red Flag attack on the 1 March Moscow
 "consultative meeting,' calling the Chinese comment "a splendid and in-
 spiring call to all people of the world to be on guard against the tricks
 of the modern revisionists."  On the 8th, NCNA quotes from a denunciation
 of the 1 March meeting by CPA (M-L) Chairman Hill as printed in the 23
 April Vanguard..
 May 7-10:   The CPs of the world celebrate the 20th anniversary of VE Day
 as a great triumph of the forces of socialism over fascism, with attacks
 on "U.S. imperialism"  s fascism's successor varying in directness and
 vituperation in accordance with each Party's stand in the Sino-Soviet
 conflict.   In Europe, the victory anniversary is also merged with "libera-
 tion" anniversaries in East Germany and Czechoslovakia.  The East German
 celebration is favored by top-level delegations from the CPSU (headed by
 Kosygin, vs. Podgorny to Czecho), Poland (Cyrankiewicz), Italy (Longo) and
 a few others.  The Rumanians, however, favor Prague with their top-level
 delegation (headed by Maurer), the only party or state to do so.  In
 Prague, Novotny, while pledging fidelity to Moscow, says that the Czechs

 intend to work for closer relations with the Chinese and Albanians in the
 interest of a "united  rout  ag is nst the  imperialists  whose  aggression
 is encouraged by Communist disunity."
 Soviet speeches and statements, while hard in their condemnation
 of "U.S. aggression," hold firm to the Khrushchevian "peaceful coexist-
 ence" line.  Limited positive mention of Stalin's contribution  is made
 and Marshals Voroshilov and Zhukov were accorded full recognition.  The
 Chinese, however, use  the occasion to publish two major, 10,000-word
 blasts, one in People's Daily on the 9th and one in Red Flag No. 5, ap-
 pearing on the 10th.                             Both savagely attack the U.S. as trying to follow
 in Hitler's footsteps, but the former is aimed even more sgainst the CPSU
 leadership than against the U.S.
 The People's Daily article, entitled "The Historical Experience of
 the War Against Fascism," is a highly assertive CCP polemic on the "trhole
 series of important differences of principle between Marxist-Leninists
 and the modern revisionists on the question of how to assess the anti-
 Fascist war and on the lessons to be drawn from it," necessary because
 "the K. revisionists ... have been deliberately distorting history ever
 since the 20th CPSU Congress, obscuring facts and concocting conclusions
 that are extremely harmful."  The victory of fascism was achieved pri-
 marily by the Soviet people and army, but it is "indissolubly linked
 with Stalin's leadership" and was made possible only by the socialist
 system and the dictatorship of the proletariat.  The drawn-out Chinese
 correction of the modern Soviet "falsifiers of history" builds up to
 a parallel between the British-French-U.S. appeasement of fascism and
 the present Soviet "betrayal of proletarian internationals i
 "Instead of uniting with all possible forces against U.S. imperialism,
 they are bent on aligning themselves with U.S. imperialism against
 the people of the world and on realizing U.S.-Soviet world hegemony....
 How can you expect 'concerted action' with the M-Ls and masses
 of the people in all countries, who constitute over 90% of the world's
 population, when you persist in the revisionist line laid down at
 the 20th and 22nd Congresses and embodied in the program of the PCSU,
 and when you persist in the line of 'Soviet-U.S. cooperation for
 domination of the world?'..."
 Indicatively, of the 16 footnoted references listed at the end of
 the article, 12 are from the works of Mao, 3 from Stalin, and 1 from
 Lenin!
 The Red Flag article, entitled "Commemorate the Victory over German
 Fascism" and signed by Lo Jui-ching, a senior general who is Vice Minister
 of Defense, is an extremely bellicose exposition of the militant Chinese
 views on war, "paper tigers," nuclear weapons, etc.  "This decade is
 witnessing atomic imperialism playing a superb farce."  "U.S. imperialism
 is like a large tree eaten hollow by worms."  Etc.

 In reviewing the less Drs of the "great victory," Lo loses no
 opportunity to strike at Soviet distortion of history and taunts:
 "Just imagine, if the Soviet people and army had not been led by
 Stalin but by revisionists such as Khrushchev,... the outcome
 could only have been disastrous defeat or capitulation...."
 It... although a war imposed on us by imperialism will cause sacri-
 fices, losses, and des-t,7 action, it will also educate the people,
 and the people will win the war as well as peace and progress.
 May 8:  NCNA reports from Accra on a "so-called photo and books exhibi-
 tion arranged by the Soviet delegation to the 4th Afro-Asian Peoples
 Solidarity Conference" which opened the previous day in the hall where
 the conference will begin on 10 May.  "The exhibition has on display
 anti-China pamphlets and thus challenges the conference even before its
 opening by this Act of sabotage and split."  NCNA says that the Ghanaians
 expressed opposition and some removed the exhibit 10 minutes after the
 Soviets had completed it.  Next morning, however, the Soviets completely
 renewed it.

 Communist Front Organizations in India
 25X1C10b
 "India without Nehru needs strong and decisive government, and
 all those who would lose if India crumbles have a right to look for
 more of it than they see now.  What anyone outside thinks is vastly
 less important than what is thought in India.  It is those who feel
 about India with the perception and the blindness of being Indian
 who will decide what happens to Mr. Shastri, and to his party."
 (Economist - April 3, 1965)
 India offers a uniquely favorable environment for Communist-front
 organizations.  Its cultural, linguistic, racial and religious hetero-
 genity presents an ideal breeding-ground in which various dissident
 groups prosper and agitate for a wide variety of general as well as
 special political interests.  A high degree of public interest - es-
 pecially within the middle class -- in political and social matters, com-
 bined with a considerable amount of emotionalism, a lack of sufficient
 knowledge about general and political matters, and frequently an anti-
 Western and vacillating bias have made it possible for the Communists
 to organize some 50 active fronts in India, 10 of which are affiliated
 to international communist front organizations   They reflect not only
 the Sinn-Soviet dissensions current in the World Communist Movement, but
 have suffered from the consequences of the 196+ split of the Communist
 Party of India into two parties. The principal groups which are most at-
 tracted to Communist fronts have been students, educated working women,
 artists and writers, and various other members of the educated middle
 class.  The educated unemployed and the minority linguistic groups (as
 well as refugees from Pakistan) have also been particularly active in
 front organizations.
 The communist movement in India is not considered as a foreign-
 dominated group by the great mass of the Indian electorate.  The CPI,
 prior to the split, has shared approximately the same slogans with
 parties of the democratic left, overtly functioned as a conventional
 political party, and tried to portray itself as a nationalistic party.
 The fronts in India are apparently even more accepted by the general
 public which is not alert to the dangers of the world communist move-
 ment or the operations of front groups.  They are now in the process of
 being captured by either the Communist Party of India/Left (CPI/L) or
 the Communist Party of India/Right (CPI/R), and have been relatively in-
 active the past year or so.

 Although the present constitutional system of India is not subject
 to widespread criticism (individuals in India are usually more a target
 of attack than the system), there is a strong undercurrent of dis-
 satisfaction among the public with the general condition of the Indian
 economy and government.  Communist front organization efforts to influence
 government policy have been primarily various forms of agitation outside
 the Parliament designed to discredit the government.  Petitions and demon-
 strations have been organized on issues such as Kashmir, nuclear testing,
 the cost of living - and more recently, the Indo-Pakistan confrontation
 over the Rann of Kutch.  Indian fear of China, never far below the surface
 especially since the Chinese aggression in 1962, has been intensified by
 what India regards as the development of all too friendly relations be-
 tween Pakistan and Communist China - the two implacable enemies of India.
 The explosion of the second nuclear device by Communist China on May 14
 (coinciding with the visit of Prime Minister Shastri to Moscow) will also
 undoubtedly increase not only the fear of China but further exacerbate
 the conflict between the CPI/R and the CPI/L and their front organizations,
 most of which are turning more and more towards the pro-Soviet CPI/R.
 Of the many front organizations in India, the six most active in
 1962-63 (as reported by USIA) are briefly described below, and in more
 detail in an unclassified attachment.  Perhaps more than communist front
 organizations in other countries, the Indian are closely intermeshed, marked
 by dual leadership and simultaneous participation in several front groups
 as well as in the communist parties.  Particularly recently, communist
 energies have been diverted and introverted by the left-right splits at
 home, as well as by outside threats to India.  Always vocal, and certainly
 never to be underestimated, the front activities in India since 1962 ap-
 pear to consist mostly of the "saved talking to the saved."
 Peace and international friendship fronts, of which there are over
 20 operating in India, were organized to discredit Western foreign policy
 and to advocate support by India of the foreign policy of the Soviet Union.
 These fronts oppose Indian cooperation with the West and Indian support to
 the West in any v ay.
 The largest peace front is the All India Peace Council - an affilate
 of the World Peace Council - with approximately 5,000 active members and
 about 35,000 sympathizers.  It has branches in all major cities in India
 and has been an effective channel for communist propaganda.  However,
 particularly since the Chinese invasion of 1962, its influence has been
 declining, even though pro-Soviet elements are in firm control.
 The Indian Association for Afro-Asian Solidarity, the major Indian
 communist international peace and friendship front, has played an important
 role with the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization as the chief sup-
 port of the Soviets against the Chinese.  It cooperates with the All India
 Peace Council and appeals to the same groups, although it has never had
 the popularity of the All India Peace Council.

 Most communist countries have a front organization within India
 ostensibly organized to improve their reputation and influence.  The
 most prominent of this type is the Indo-Soviet Cultural Society which
 is considered the most active front organization in India.  It has di-
 rectly supported Soviet foreign policy and has also supported and fostered
 communism within India.  It has sought, by low key propaganda, to establish
 the image of the Soviet Union as a peaceful and progressive nation.
 The All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), an affiliate of the World Federation
 of Trade Unions, is the largest labor front organization and one of the
 oldest fronts in India.  It is not now very active; the left-right split
 in the communist movement (particularly concerning cooperation with the
 Congress Party) is mirrored in the AIKS, and the CPI/L is dominant.  Be-
 cause of lack of unity, factionalism even among the dominant left wing,
 and of thelongstanding strength of the Congress Party in the countryside,
 the AIKS has been prevented from achieving major influence in rural India.
 However, its emphasis on building support among the peasants makes it
 potentially one of the most influential.
 Much of the communist effective power for political agitation, sabo-
 tage and espionage has come from its urban labor front, the All India Trade
 Union Congress (AITUC), also a member of the WFTU.  The AITUC cannot matchu
 in size the 1.5 million member Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC),
 the labor body of the Congress Party.  However, not being under any obliga-
 tion to the ruling party as is ITTTUC, it has greater tactical freedom --
 particularly in its ability to call strikes in vital industries.  Less than
 one-half of Indian laborers belong to any union and the AITUC probably con-
 trols only a fifth of these.  But those under its control are strategically
 placed and fairly well disciplined.  Until 1964 when CPI factionalism be-
 came rampant, the AITUC was the most effective trade union federation.  It
 has served as an important supporter of the Soviets' attempts to maintain
 their influence within Asian trade unions over and against the Chinese
 although it too is faced with a division of leadership between the CPI/R
 and CPI/L.
 The All India Youth Federation, affiliate of the World Federation of
 Democratic Youth, appears to be fully controlled by the CPI/R, although
 some left elements have split off.  It is one of the most active Indian
 fronts, and also active within the Soviet controlled mass youth organiza-
 tion, the WFDY.  In many ways, however, the youth and student groups can
 hardly be called front organizations in the usual sense since their com-

 904.                       WHITEWASHING THE KGB
 25X1C10b
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:  There has always been a respectable volume of fiction
 and other material published in the Soviet Union, glorifying the "Chekist"
 (the term for a secret policeman, derived from the name of the original
 Bolshevik secret police organization, the Cheka).  Recently, however, the
 KGB, possibly with the collaboration of the Chief Intelligence Directorate
 (GRU) of the General Staff of the Soviet Ministry of Defense, seems to
 have launched a publicity campaign to "improve the image" of Soviet secret
 police and espionage organizations.  This campaign appeared to start just
 prior to Khrushchev's fall  with the disclosure of a highly colored version
 of Richard Sorge's story                                         and by February
 1965 it had reached such a pitch that Literaturnaya Rossiya, a literary
 weekly, published a cartoon showing a long line of writers eagerly waiting
 outside an editorial office, carrying manuscripts with such titles as
 "Operation Rose," "Operation X," and "Operation White Elephant."
 One explanation would be that, in view of revelations of Stalinist
 misdeeds in the last few years, not to mention the long-standing and well-
 founded public fear and hatred of the secret police, the high command of
 the KGB decided more effort was needed to make their organization popular;
 popularity would make it easier to get tips, recruit informants, and pres-
 sure suspects.  There would also be political reasons for such a campaign.
 Publicity campaigns on behalf of government departments are familiar phe-
 nomena in many countries; even where the government is undemocratic, a
 department which is not popular or at least respected finds it harder to
 get money and a voice in major decisions.  The 1953 denunciation and exe-
 cution of Beria, the change of the Ministry of State Security to a Com-
 mittee, and Khrushchev's anti-Stalin campaign were accompanied by person-
 nel cuts, morale problems, and a loss of influence for the Chekists.  None
 of the leaders intended to allow another Beria to arise.  Now, however,
 when there is no single dictator, the secret police have a chance to try
 to "sell" their organization.  Coming at this juncture, the KGB's campaign
 suggests both the achievement of a position of power, and also an effort to

 expand that position by making the Chekists less vulnerable to criticism
 and attack within ruling circles.  Furthermore, when men or organizations
 are powerful, they cannot hear their praises sung loudly enough.
 There is plausible speculation (see attachments) that the KGB has
 been virtually uncontrolled for the last few years, and that just prior
 to Khrushchev's fall the KGB was actually sabotaging his foreign policy
 and undermining his position.  The KGB's power position was indicated by
 an August 1964 article by Roger Hilsman showing that in the 1962 Cuban
 crisis, it was a KGB officer in Washington, and not Ambassador Dobrynin,
 who did the crucial negotiating with the Americans.  (Hillman in 1962
 was chief of the Department of State's intelligence and research organi-
 zation, and in a position to know.)  The KGB apparently served Khrushchev
 faithfully in the Cuban affair.  But signs soon appeared that suggested
 KGB sabotage of Khrushchev's diplomacy.
 In October 1963, the KGB staged the arrest of an American professor
 and held him incommunicado for 16 days, at a time when a Soviet-American
 cultural exchange agreement was pending.  In March 1961, British and
 American attaches were drugged in Odessa, as Western doctors proved by
 clinical evidence and laboratory tests.  Six months later, British and
 American attaches were seized and searched in Khaborovsk, in violation
 of diplomatic immunity, by what Pravda called the "glorious Chekists."
 The most striking evidence that the KGB is uncontrolled appeared
 in September 1961+.  A West German technician, Horst Schwirkmann, came
 to Moscow and cleared out many hidden KGB microphones in the West German
 Embassy; his work accomplished,., he obtained the required Soviet Foreign
 Ministry permission for a tourist trip to visit a historic monastery
 building at Zagorsk, 70 km. from Moscow.  While visiting the monastery
 (on 6 September) he suddenly felt his left pant leg become damp; it turned
 out that he had been attacked with mustard gas, a deadly gas used in World
 War I which burns the skin.  Soviet Foreign Ministry officials held up
 Schwirkmann's evacuation to the West for two days, apparently because the
 KGB hoped to get him into a Soviet hospital where he could be interrogated
 (or "liquidated"?).  Since this whole action was likely to upset arrange-
 ments for a Khrushchev trip to Bonn, one must conclude that Soviet Foreign
 Ministry officials are more influenced by the KGB than by considerations
 of foreign policy.
 Khrushchev can hardly have favored the Zagorsk operation; probably
 he either knew nothing about it beforehand, or could not prevent it.
 His own overthrow five weeks later (15 October) can only have taken place
 with at least the acquiescence of the KGB, who at a minimum failed to in-
 form him of what they knew was afoot.  A. N. Shelepin and his protege
 V. Ye. Semichastny, the past and present chiefs of the KGB, received
 prompt recognition after the coup.  On 16 November, Shelepin became a full
 member of the CPSU Presidium and Semichastny became a full member of the
 CPSU Central Committee.  Aside from Brezhnev, Podgorny, and Suslov, Shelepin
 is the only party Secretary who is also a member of the Presidium, and of

 these four, Shelepin is the only man also to hold high state office, being
 a Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers.  Since Khrushchev's fall,
 Shelepin has been the most prominent of the younger leaders, carrying out
 an important mission to restore and further exploit relations with the
 United Arab Republic, and also making a special trip to Mongolia.  (He
 was with Nasser when the Egyptian leader in a speech told the US to "drink
 up the sea," and shortly afterwards Nasser invited Ulbricht for a visit.)
 Khrushchev occasionally tried to reassure the Soviet public that party
 control would prevent a return to police terror; now, instead of such re-
 assurances, we have the KGB propaganda campaign.
 As part of the campaign, the popular magazine Ogonek is publishing
 a serial biography of Sorge, written by Sergei Golyakov and Vladimir
 Ponizovsky; perhaps the campaign's true sponsorship is shown by the fact
 that Golyakov and Ponizovsky describe Sorge as a member of a special
 branch of the NKVD (the KGB of the 1930's), rather than as an employee
 of the GRU, as was actually the case.  Sorge the hard-drinking libertine
 is described as a dedicated man who performed a lofty duty.  Several re-
 cent novels have used the theme that Stalin and his cohorts overlooked
 vital intelligence reports:  The Last Two Weeks, by Alexandr Rosen (Zvezda,
 1965, No. 1), June 1941, by Grigori Baklanov  Znamya, 1965, Nos. 1 &2),
 Not Born as Soldiers, by K. Simonov (Znamya, 1965, Nos. 1 & 2), and I am
 Responsible for Everything, by Yuri German (Zvezda, 1964, No. 10).  These
 describe devoted and courageous secret agents, whose warnings were ignored.
 Vadim Kozhevnikov, who has already contributed Stars on Earth about Soviet
 agents in Germany, will have another espionage story serialized this spring,
 The Shield and the Sword.  Meanwhile, names of rehabilitated NKVD officers
 purged b  Stalin, frequently appear in the Soviet press
 , and articles have memorialized the contributions of the
 Chekists in rooting out Nazi spies during the war:  on 3 and 2 April, both
 Izvestiya and Sovetskaya Belorussiya carried such an article by a Lt. Gen.
 Zheleznikov, who has signed a similar piece for Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star)
 as "Former chief of the Administration for Counterintelligence and 'Smersh'
 on the Bryansk and Second Baltic Fronts."  Pravda announced on 21 February
 that Col Lev Yefimovich Manevich had been posthumously made a Hero of
 Socialist Labor, and lauded his refusal, as the agent "Etienne," to give
 in under interrogation by the police of a reactionary government.
 It is easier to imagine that a KGB man might be courageous than that
 he would be humane.  Yet a recent serialized novel, The Fall of the Jesuit,
 by Ya. Golovanov (Komsomolskaya Pravda, 8-20 December 19   , tries to de-
 pict today's Chekists as cultured, intelligent, sympathetic and compas-
 sionate.  They are soccer fans, discuss ballet, drink mineral water, and
 think fondly of their children.  The story describes a ne'er-do-well with
 religious tendencies who serves the Germans, spends time in Paris brothels,
 returns to the Soviet Union, and finally tries in a clumsy way to sell in-
 formation to an American spy.  In one episode, the Chekists discuss, before
 making a house search, how they can do it without frightening the children
 in the house.  And the author comments that when he was a child he was

 always afraid to pass the NKVD headquarters, but now he realizes that
 there has been a transformation since the days when a police agent was
 judged by the number of persons he arrested; there has been an "irre-
 versible" change in the psychology of the police.
 Another story, Reverse Reading, adapted from a book by N. Tarianov
 and published in Leninskoye Znamya (24+ November-2 December 196+), re-
 lates that besides uncovering traitors and outwitting foreign agents,
 the Chekists have to present Soviet courts with "irrefutable evidence
 of criminal activities"; while in England the illegal possession of
 "official secrets" is a crime in itself, the Soviet police must prove
 that the information was in fact security information and that "it was
 passed to a foreign power."  According to these stories, the KGB gets
 permission from a Procurator (district attorney) before searching a home
 and before making an arrest.  Sometimes, however, the true position of
 the KGB in Soviet society shows through:  at the end of The Fall of the
 Jesuit, the villain is arrested by a KGB man who "tactfully  gets him
 out of a hospital ward by masquerading as a doctor, examining all the
 patients, and telling the culprit he will have to go to Moscow for treat-
 ment; it is hard to imagine a police official being allowed to do all
 this in a non-Communist hospital.  The Jesuit story also reveals that
 the KGB's informants are omnipresent, and its files all-inclusive--they
 still include "confessions" made in 1941, when suspects were often tor-
 tured into making false accusations, and the KGB still considers these
 "confessions" valid.
 The fact is, that while the KGB does not serve a Stalin any longer,
 there is still no effective protection against arbitrary arrest and im-
 prisonment.  A paper from a Procurator means little if the Procurator
 himself is afraid of--or in league with--the police.  If an American
 professor like F. C. Barghoorn can be framed and held incommunicado,
 what happens in the case of Soviet citizens, who have no Embassy to
 look out for their interests, no President Kennedy to intervene for
 their release?  In the case of Schwirkmann, terrorism was apparently
 a principal aim; the KGB hoped to intimidate foreign embassies to keep
 them from trying to protect themselves against audio-surveillance.
 Soviet citizens have of course no protection from such surveillance--
 or intimidation.
 In today's USSR, punishment is often carried out without reference
 to courts and state prisons:  poets and writers (e.g., Mikhail Naritsa,
 Valeriy Tarsis, and Aleksandr Yesenin-Volpin)are placed in mental hospi-
 tals, or are banished for a time to factories and construction sites
 (e.g., Andrei Voznesensky and Viktor Nekrasov).  Rebellious youths are
 sent to the Virgin Lands or other labor colonies (see Mihajlo Mihajlov's
 first Delo article, in New Leader attached to                                 25X1 C1 Ob
 indeed Shelepin himself, as chief of the Komsomol, is said to have super-
 vised the sending of hundreds of thousands of young people to the Virgin
 Lands in the middle-1950's, before he was officially connected with the
 KGB.  With the approval of easily influenced local Soviets, the police
 may legally impose up to five years exile at forced labor for those they
 charge with "parasitism," without any recourse to the courts.

 In the courts themselves, defense attorneys are intimidated and
 guilt is presumed unless disproven.  It is very easy for Soviet au-
 thorities, including police authorities, to convey dire threats of
 punishment to a people which still remembers the Stalin era.  At the
 22nd CPSU Congress in 1961, where he denounced Beria and Stalin, Shelepin
 also advocated calling the "anti-Party group to strictest account," said
 that the actions of "hooligans, thieves, loafers, bribe-takers and slan-
 derers should be classed as grave crimes," and lashed out against certain
 "unstable elements" among the cultural intelligentsia, accusing them of
 "sabotage on the ideological front."  Such statements, coming from a KGB
 chief, were ominous to Soviet ears.
 Today, Shelepin has become more powerful than he was in 1961; if
 no longer the official head of the KGB, he is apparently still the supreme
 authority in police and intelligence matters.  (For example, a Pravda item
 of 10 April 1965 stated that Shelepin had addressed a meeting of Party
 administrative specialists and Republic Ministers of the Defense of Public
 Order, held under Central Committee auspices; under Soviet conditions,
 this indicates that Shelepin is the CPSU Central Committee Secretary su-
 pervising the police organs.)  His ruthlessness is shown by the fact that
 in 1959 he personally awarded the Order of the Red Banner to Bogdan N.
 Stashinsky, the assassin of Stefan Bandera, the Ukrainian exile leader.
 Extracts from The Fall of the Jesuit are contained in an unclassified
 attachment to this guidance.  An unclassified biography of Shelepin and
 reproductions of articles are also attached.  See also Press Comment 5 May

 905.           TIE PROSPECTS FOR AN INDEPENDENT VIETNAM
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:  There has been much speculation that if the war in
 Vietnam could only be brought to an end, Ho Chi Minh and his Communist
 Lao Dong Party would--given Ho's international background and the tra-
 ditional Vietnamese fear and hatred of China--become an Asian Tito.  Even
 should such a possibility deserve serious consideration in the total Viet-
 namese problem, a close and realistic examination of the evidence shows
 there is little reason to expect such a development.
 In the first place, Tito's Yugoslavia was separated from the USSR
 by some 200 miles and a ring of newly absorbed satellites whose depend-
 ability in a crisis was at best untested.  Vietnam has a common border
 with China.  Yugoslavia had common land borders with anti-Communist
 states, which Vietnam does not have.
 In the second place, and perhaps of greater importance, at the time
 of Tito's demands for a voice in the Communist camp (and subsequent ex-
 pulsion) he was a vigorous man of 55 in firm control of his Party and its
 day-to-day operations.  In contrast, Ho is 75 years old and his role in
 the Communist Lao Dong Party is at the present moment questionable.  It
 is certain that he does not deal with day-to-day problems and some sources
 even say that he is being used to take advantage of his immense prestige
 as a veteran revolutionary in the world Communist movement.
 Tito and the Yugoslav Communist Party made their stand for independ-
 ence and for the right to rule their own country.  But ever since Vietnam
 has been divided, the stated objective of Ho and his Communist Lao Dong
 Party has been to take over South Vietnam.  Nor are these expansionist
 objectives limited to South Vietnam.  There are indications that Ho and
 the Lao Dong Party still have responsibility in the World Communist move-
 ment for all of the areas of the former French Indochina.  If this is
 true it means that they will ultimately expect to extend their realm to
 include Cambodia and Laos as well as South Vietnam.
 The Yugoslav Communist Party in 1948 was intensively loyal to Tito
 personally and to his programs.  But there are factional rivalries at
 the highest levels of the North Vietnamese Communist Party.  The ex-
 tremist, pro-Peking faction is led by the Party First Secretary Le Duan
 and includes the following prominent members:  Truong Chinh, former
 Party Secretary General; Le Duc Tho, chief of the Party Organization
 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-03061A000300030004-3

 Department; Nguyen Chi Thanh, former top political Commissar in the North
 Vietnamese Army; and Hoang Van Hoan, former ambassador to Peking.  This
 extremist faction is rigidly doctrinaire and espouses the harsh lines of
 the Chinese Communists.  The so-called pro-Soviet moderate element in the
 Lao Dong Party has long been led by Premier Pham Van Dong.  His primary
 support comes from the hero of Dien Bien Phu, Defense Minister General Vo
 Nguyen Giap, who is known to bear personal enmity toward both Truong Chinh
 and Nguyen Chi Thanh.  State Construction Commissioner Le Thanh Nghi,
 North Vietnam's foremost industrial management and planning expert, is
 also a member of the "moderate" faction.  The existence of such high level
 factions in the Party would make it impossible for Ho to eliminate foreign
 influence in Vietnamese affairs even if he had the desire to do so.
 The existence of these factions guarantees Chicom domination of all
 parts of Vietnam that come under the control of Ho Chi Minh and the Lao
 Dong Party.  If the Soviet-oriented "moderate" faction took over and tried
 to eliminate the pro-Peking extremist faction altogether, the extremist
 faction would, in the final analysis, establish their own government some-
 where along the Chinese-Vietnamese border and immediately call on Chinese
 aid to thwart the plans of the "revisionist usurpers."  The USSR could not
 possibly sustain its adherents in Vietnam, in the face of determined Chicom
 opposition, unless it resorted to the use of nuclear weapons against China
 itself.  This is exceedingly unlikely.
 If, on the other hand, the pro-Peking extremists come to fully domi-
 nate the North Vietnamese Party there is no doubt that they will look to-
 ward Peking, both as a developmental model and supplier of material aid.
 They will be as eager as Peking is to prove that all non-Communists (and
 even some of the Communists) are paper tigers who do not have the deter-
 mination to oppose the will of China.
 Thus, so long as the Sino-Soviet split continues and that split is
 reflected in the factions of the Communist Lao Dong Party, those portions
 of Vietnam ruled by the Communists will inevitably come under Chinese Com-
 munist domination.  It is for this reason that Ho tried so hard to mediate
 the Sino-Soviet split and to avoid making a definite and final choice be-
 tween China and the Soviet Union.  He realizes that for him there is no
 choice; the act of choosing will make a Chinese province of however much
 of Vietnam he controls.  To think that he can declare himself and his
 country free from the domination of Communist China is to ignore reality.
 Other aspects of the Vietnamese question are important for the Free
 World to consider.  In the arrangements that took place at the end of
 World War Two it was understood that all of Yugoslavia would come under
 the Communist zone of influence.  The Free World had no commitment to the
 Yugoslav people to protect them from the ravages of a Communist takeover.
 Such is not the case in South Vietnam.  The 15 million people there have
 rejected Communism as the form of government under which they wish to live,
 and have made a long and valiant struggle against a foreign inspired and

 supported invasion; they deserve the protection of the Free World.  In
 view of the manner in which the North Vietnamese Communists have treated
 their on people, it is not difficult to imagine the torture and terror
 they would inflict on those who have fought so long and so hard against
 them.
 In 1948, there was good reason for the non-Communist world to risk
 more on the possibility that Tito might throw off the shackles of Stalin-
 ist domination.  Until that time, the Marxists claimed that conflict be-
 tween Communist states was impossible.  They said that the competition
 of monopoly capitalist states for raw materials and markets was the cause
 of wars and that the same kind of national rivalries could not, by defi-
 nition, take place between Communist states.  The myth that the mere adop-
 tion of Communism would eliminate conflict forever made it attractive to
 naive, unthinking people.  The thesis was an important aspect of the "sci-
 ence" of Marxism, of the legend that Communism was the means for achieving
 Utopia for mankind.  Tito's rebellion caused that myth to collapse on the
 heads of Communists everywhere and the Sino-Soviet split some ten years
 later laid the ghost to rest forever.  To exert any great effort on Ho's
 defection or to gamble away the freedom of Southeast Asia on it is clearly
 not worth the risk involved.  Ho will find, as have all others who have
 shown the desire to lessen their absolute dependence on their Communist
 masters, that the Free World is more than willing to help them.  But first
 they must show the desire.                                                  25X1 C1 Ob

 THE SOVIETS TAKE THEIR POUND OF FLESH
 25X1C10b
 25X1C10b
 The materialism of the Soviet leaders is not merely theoretical.  In
 terms of worldly goods, they have shown themselves ready to take what they
 can get, no_matter how damaging to unwary partners.  Alone among the vic-
 tors of World War II., the USSR seized and shipped out of the territory it
 occupied as much machinery and equipment as it could haul away.  This took
 place not only in East Germany, but in all the areas through which Soviet
 armies passed.  In the "ex-enemy" countries, East Germany, Hungary, Bul-
 garia, and Rumania, reparations were demanded, $300 million from Rumania
 and $200 million from Hungary, while East German reparations deliveries
 came to $4.3 billion before they were ended in 1953.  It is estimated that
 East Germany had delivered $15 billion worth of goods aside from repara-
 tions by 1957.                            After reparations were reduced, the Soviets continued to
 claim joint ownership of former German assets with Hungary and Rumania
 (thanks to German investments and seizures of property during the war,
 these assets comprised many key industries), and required Poland to de-
 liver coal as "recompense" for a tiny share in East German deliveries.
 "German" property in Czechoslovakia was shipped to the USSR.  In Manchu-
 ria too, which Soviet troops occupied at the end of World War II, the
 Soviets stripped the steel mills of machinery with a capacity to produce
 two million tons of steel.  An American audit estimated that $2 billion
 worth of equipment was taken from Manchuria by the Soviets.
 Such policies could not be carried on indefinitely, as the Hungarian
 and Polish revolts of 1956 showed, and the satellites do not pay tribute
 any longer.  But the Soviets continue to make a ruble whenever they can.
 In the construction of the large-diameter pipeline from the USSR to Czecho-
 slovakia, Hungary, and East Germany, a Soviet-sponsored project which will
 give Soviet oil a competitive advantage over Rumanian oil in the other
 satellites, the Czechs, Hungarians, and East Germans themselves pay the
 costs of construction.  Austrian reparations deliveries to the USSR con-
 tinued until 1963.  Egyptian cotton has been resold by the Soviets in the

 :_iarkets where the Egyptians themselves normally sell their cotton; Polish
 coal has been resold in East Germany; Ghanaian cocoa has been resold in
 trlcstern Europe; Greek tobacco, cotton and other products have been resold
 in Western markets.  Where barter arrangements have been concluded, the
 Soviets have later overpriced the goods they supplied hoping that the
 overcharge would not be noticed; in Afghanistan, where this was done, the
 prices were only brought into line after alert Afghan officials pointed
 out the discrepancy with Western prices.  When the UAR protested in such
 a case, the Soviets coolly replied that the overcharge of 30 per cent was
 to compensate them for the fact that the Egyptians could not pay hard cur-
 rency.  Soviet trade officials insist that any trade disputes be settled
 by Soviet courts, which are hardly impartial.  When the Soviets want to
 break a contract for political or other reasons, as when they canceled a
 contract to deliver $20 million worth of oil to Israel, Soviet courts
 ensure that no damages fall on the USSR.
 Soviet motives in their trade and aid program are mainly political,
 but the so-called "aid" is a sound commercial proposition as well.  Al-
 though the term "aid" calls to mind grants or sales at minimum prices,
 such as US aid programs have often made, Soviet "aid" is really only trade
 on the barter principle, with an interest charge included.  Aside from a
 few "loss leader" projects, like the Bhilai steel mill in India, the Soviet
 contribution in such arrangements consists of goods which are relatively
 redundant from the Kremlin's point of view (if not always from that of the
 Soviet consumer).  This is particularly true of military equipment, which
 forms an increasingly large proportion of Soviet "aid."  The sale of obso-
 lete arms is almost pure profit, and sometimes even current models can be
 traded away without any hardship to the Soviet forces, thanks to the tre-
 mendous scale of Soviet arms production, in 1962 estimated to be 23 per
 cent greater than in 1955.  (For a discussion of the Soviet political use
 of arms deliveries, see BPG #833, 12 October 1961., and attachments.)
 Even with other Communist governments, the Soviets expect to make
 money on arms sales.  The Chinese Communists have published their letter
 of 29 February 1964 to the CPSU Central Committee  Peki y
 (    n  Review, 8 May
 1961), charging that Soviet loans to China mainly served for the Chinese
 purchase of war materiel, used largely in the Korean War.        On 20 April
 1965, the Albanian newspaper Zeri I Poopullit repeated the charge, compar-
 ing the Soviet leaders with the famous  merchant of death," Basil Zaharov.
 Both the Chinese and the Albanians point out that Soviet experts serve as
 a means of penetration and internal control in the countries to which they
 are sent.  The Soviets, from the Chinese-Albanian standpoint, not only let
 others take the political risks and costs in bloodshed, they also make a
 financial profit and place their own agents in key positions.  (See attach-
 ment for text of Chinese and Albanian statements.)  The Chinese and Alba-
 nians are of course trying to make an anti-Soviet case, but their charges
 are quite credible.  Moreover, the Soviets are now quite likely charging
 North Vietnam for any arms delivered to that country.  Other governments,
 like Sukarno's and Nasser's, support "national liberation" and "anti-
 imperialist" struggles, and pay the Soviets for the wherewithal for con-
 ductint  or aiding these campaigns, which assist the Soviets politically.

 The Albanian article also charged that the Soviets provide obsolete
 weapons to North Vietnam.  On April 29, President Jomo Kenyatta rejected
 an arms shipment at Mombasa, partly because the arms were obsolete and
 partly because he did not want to employ the 17-man team of Soviet "tech-
 nicians" who had arrived in Nairobi a week earlier.  Another aspect of
 Soviet profit-taking trade policies is their failure to provide costly
 service facilities or stocks of spare parts for their customers; their
 usual rule is to unload and let the customer worry about operation.  Thus
 the UAR recently had to purchase $125,000 worth of spare parts from Gen-
 eral Motors for Soviet-built trucks, copies of old GM designs.  (Spare
 parts are also a serious problem within the USSR itself.)               25X1 C 10b

 Fact Sheet
 24 May 1965
 MM.jor Communist Front Organ ations in India
 Brief descriptions of selected front-organizations indicate the
 interplay of front group leadership, among CPI and other fronts. This
 pattern is typical of Indian front organizations, all dependent upon an
 elite few for direction and coordinated efforts:
 All India Peace Council.  Pro-Soviet elements are in firm control
 of the AIPC.  This was symbolized by the November 1963 replacement of
 Pandit Sunderlal, a former president of the India-China Friendship Asso-
 ciation, by the pro-Soviet Congress NIP Diwan Chaman Lal as its chairman
 and dropping of CPI (left) leader A. K. Gopalan from the AIPC's Presi-
 dential Committee.  Though Chitta Biswas replaced the CIP (right) Sec-
 retariat member Romesh Chandra as an AIPC joint secretary general at
 this time, the latter was simultaneously chosen to replace the late
 Saifuddin Kitchlew on the WPC's Presidential Committee.  This is the
 WPC's highest organ, and it -currently has both Sunderlal and Chaman
 Lal as members, too.  Biswas previously served at the Vienna Interna-
 tional Institute for Peace, the WPC's headquarters.  The AIPC has
 thirty-two members on the WPC, within which it gives strong support
 to the Soviet cause.
 In or prior to March 1960, Divan Chaman Lal, not then prominent in
 the AIPC, organized the Indian Parliamentarians for Peace.  Numerically
 speaking, this was primarily a Congress Party affair, and it contained
 about one-third of all the members of India's  national Parliament (both
 houses).  It continued to draw in a wider circle than just those formally
 affiliated with the AIPC even after Lal's rise to prominence in the
 latter organization.  The Parliamentarians sponsored a "seminar" on
 international relations in December 1963 and got Nehru to inaugurate
 it.  The main organizer and manipulator of this meeting was said to be
 the Communist Romesh Chandra.  A much larger international "peace con-
 ference" was sponsored by the Parliamentarians in November 1964 on the
 theme of carrying forward the program of the late prime minister.  Once
 again the prime minister (this time Lal Bahudur Shastri) was inveigled
 into addressing the meeting.  V. K. Krishna Menon, though India's most
 famous leftist cabinet member prior to the Sino-Indian border war of
 late 1962 and not formerly associated with the peace movement, was a
 key showpiece at both meetings.
 Indian Association for Afro-Asian Solidari  .  This organization
 has played an important role within AAPSO where it has been the chief
 support of the Soviets against the Chinese.  Two significant changes in
 its personnel occurred in 1964 when Tara Chand* replaced Rameshwari

 Nehru as president and Chataur Narayan Malaviya replaced Muhammad
 Kallimullah as Indian representative on the Cairo AAPSO Secretariat.
 Though ostensibly a joint front of the Congress party and the CP India
 (right), the dominant personality in the organization appears to be
 Romesh Chandra, a Secretariat member of the latter party.  Until Novem-
 ber 1963 Chandra and C. N. Malaviya were pro-Soviet joint secretaries
 general of the All-India Peace Council.
 All India Trade Union Congress.  This organization, with a claimed
 strength over a million and a government-certified one of about half
 that amount, has been India's most effective trade union federation, at
 least until it became the scene of CPI factionalism in 1964.  in that
 year the AITUC's "figurehead" president, S. S. Mirajkar, while still
 formally a member of the CPI (right), took the lead in accusing AITUC
 secretary general S. A. Dange of misappropriating AITUC funds and of
 having offered his services to the British in 192+; Mirajkar then pro-
 ceeding officially to join the CPI (left).  The No. 2 AITUC leader,
 Secretary K. G. Srivastava (Dange's 1962 deputy on the WFTU Executive
 Committee), has been notably pro-Chinese in the past.  Meanwhile, the
 CPI (left) set up a committee in December 1964 under Politburo member
 P. Ramamurthi, a 1962 AITUC vice president, to take control of state
 trade union councils and individual affiliates from the CPI (right)
 leadership of S. A. Dange.  This leftist challenge has been partially
 responsible for the AITUC's rightist leadership's engaging in the
 price-rise/food shortage demonstrations of 1963-64.
 Dange is one of the WFTU's twelve vice presidents, and the AITUC
 maintains an official representative at Prague tiTU headquarters, one
 Mahendra Sen.  Another Indian resident in Prague, Satish Chatterjee,
 served as secretary general of WkTU's Trade Union International of
 Transport, Port, and Fishery Workers.  In October 1963 Dange and Sriva-
 stava (see above) attended the Moscow Congress of Soviet Trade Unions.
 All Indian Kisan Sabha.  This organization appears to be under the
 effective control of the CPI (left).  Its president, the CPI (left)
 Politburo member A. K. Gopalan, appears to have used the organization's
 facilities (offices, communications channels, etc.)  to set up a left-
 wing parallel to the right-wing-dominated CPI organization during 1962-
 64, prior to the official formation of a second CPI.  Its secretary
 general, Jagit Singh Tyalpuri, another leader of the CPI (left), serves
 as a vice president of the Agricultural and Forestry Workers TUI.  Its
 membership was estimated at a quarter of a million in August 1964.
 All India Youth Federation.  Though CPI (left) elements have split
 off to form separate units in Andhra and Kerala, the CPI (right) appears
 to be fully in control of the Federation's central organization.  CPI
 (right) Central Executive Committee member P. K. Vasudevan Nair, MP,
 continues to serve as president; as of January 1963  he was also his
 party's youth and student responsible.  CPI (right] National Council
 member Sharda (Sarrda) Mitra not only continues i serve as AIYF secre-
 tary general, but he was made secretary of the Party Headquarters Branch

 Aleksandr Nikolaevich SHELEPIN
 Chairman of the Committee for
 Party-State Control
 Goaretury and. Mesmbvr of the
 Presidium, CPSU Central Committee
 Deputy Chairman of the Council of
 Ministers
 December 19621
 AN. Shelepin, one of the youngest of the top officials
 of the CPSU, is an outstanding example of,the ambitious party official
 who makes a career out of his administrative and organizational talents.
 In mid-November 1961+, he became a full member of the CPSU Presidium.
 His most important administrative post had been that of chief of the
 KGB (Committee for State Security) from 1958 to 1961; he was succeeded
 in this post by Vladimir Yefimovich Semichastny, who appears to be his
 protege, and it is probable that Shelepin still has a role in making
 major decisions involving the KGB, the Soviet secret police organization.
 Shelepin was born in 1918 at Voronezh, the son of a rail-
 wayman.  From 1936 to 1939 he studied history at the Moscow Institute
 of History, Philosophy, and Literature; his later career suggests that
 he may have spent more time in Komsomol (Communist Youth) activities
 then on his studies.  He served during the Russo-Finnish War in 1939-
 1940, and then (in 191+0) got into full-time Komsomol work in Moscow as
 an instructor and later as head of the Agitprop Department of the Moscow
 City Komsomol.  In 19213 he became Secretary for Cadres in the All-Union
 Komsomol and a member of the All-Union Committee for Physical Training
 and Sport, an organ of the government.  Between 192+7 and 1952 he was. also
 Vice President of the International Union of Students (IUS), and he led
 the Soviet delegation to the World Festival, of Youth and Students in
 Prague in 1947. From 1952 to 1958, he served as First Secretary or Chief
 of the All-Union Komsomol.  In this capacity, he had over-all responsi-
 bility (in 1952-1957) for sending hundreds' of thousands of Soviet youth
 to the Virgin Lands as "volunteers."  During this period he was also
 Vice President of the Communist international youth front, the World
 Federation of Democratic Youth (WFIJY), and he took part in youth festi-
 vals, meetings and congresses in various Bloc cities as well as in London
 and Helsinki.
 In April 1958, at the age of 240, Shelepin put youth work
 behind him and served a short term as Chief of the Central Committee
 Party Organs Section.  Then, in December of that year, he became Chair-
 man of,the KGB, replacing General I. A. Serov, who was transferred to
 the command of Soviet military intelligence, the GRU.  Shelepin was the
 first chief of the secret police not to have spent years in "conspira-
 torial work."  It may be that he was intended to strengthen party con-
 trol of the police, to improve the public image of the police, or to
 sweep out some of the bureaucratic cobwebs' which had accumulated since
 the days of Felix Dzherzhinsky.  While in this position, he personally
 conferred the Order of the Red Banner on Bogdan Stashinsky for Stashinsky's
 murder of Lev Rebet and Stefan Bandera.
 In November 1961, Shelepin left the Imo, having become a
 member`of the Central Committee Secretariat a'month before.  Then at the

 Committee, with Shelepin as Chairman.  The Committee's activities have
 not received much publicity, but the Committee is able to take disci-
 PlinarY action or launch legal proceeding3jagainst perrsonr who cause
 "damage to the cause of building Communism."  This usually means cor-
 ruption or negligence in party or state work, especially in the economy,
 but could mean any activity the party leaders consider undesirable.
 Stalin used his control of a predecessor organization, the Workers' and
 Peasants' Inspectorate (Rabkrin), as one of his main instruments for
 gaining control of the party and state bureaucracy by weeding out poten-
 tial opponents.
 Only three men besides Shelep n are both members of the
 Secretariat and full members of the Presidium:  Brezhnev, Podgorny, and
 Suslov.  Further, of those who are both Secretaries and Presidium members,
 only Shelepin also holds high state office, being a Deputy Chairman of
 the Council of Ministers.  With his background in the Control Committee
 and the KGB, Shelepin is evidently one of the most powerful men in the
 Kremlin.

 THE FALL OF 'I'RE JESUIT
 by Ya. Golovanov
 (The events described in this story are true-to-life and
 documented.  The "Jesuit" is not an imaginary figure) and even this
 autumn you could have encountered him on the streets of Moscow.
 The leadership of State Security Committee under the USSR Council
 of Ministers has allowed our special correspondent to become familiar
 with all of the documents on the "Jesuit" case, and also to participate
 directly in the day-to-day work of the co-workers of the KGB Administra-
 tion, throughout Moscow and Moskovskaya Oblast long before the criminal
 activity of the "Jesuit" was stopped, and then to attend the interroga-
 tions, and talk with witnesses and accused.
 In the story we have changed merely certain names of its heroes --
 true heroes and "heroes" in quotes.  The time and locality of the events
 have been maintained.)
 [Synopsis:  Anatoliy Yakovievich Prokhorov in 1940 was a weak
 schoolboy, teased by his classmates for his interest in religion.
 He becomes involved with an illegal "Society for Training Jesuit
 Clergy," which seeks to attract youth into the church, and other
 members of this organization give his name to the secret police.
 By the time his name is in the files, however, he is drafted into
 an artillery regiment, and he is taken prisoner by the Germans soon
 after their attack in June 1941.  He escapes and becomes a novice
 in the church in German-occupied Vil`no,then gives information to
 the German SD, serves in a labor battalion, and comes to Paris to
 spy on the White Russians for the Germans.  After Liberation, he
 falls into the Paris underworld and after a year in prison, de-
 cides to request repatriation under the false name of Anatoliy
 Yakovlevich Yershov.  After his return to the USSR, he is soon
 arrested, confesses, and is sent to the labor camp at Pechora in
 February 1947.  Released in the amnesty of 1956, he goes to Moscow.
 In 1964, the secret police observe that one "Nikolay" is in contact
 with an American, Howard Sciaton, and discover that "Nikolay" is
 Prokhorov.  Searching Selaton's room at the Hotel Ukraina, KGB in-
 vestigator Aleksandr Roshchin finds that on the block calendar,
 the sheet for 21 December has been torn out, and the sheet for
 22 December shows a faint impression].
 The results of the analysis were ready by evening.  The sheet of
 20 December was blank. On the sheet of 22 December, there was the
 scarcely noticeable impression:  "281618 L. D".
 "The number is a 6-digit one, that is for sure," said the Captain,
 in whose laboratory experts were working.  "Evidently they were written

 by a Japanese F1mmlaster -- a felt pencil with India ink.  The impres-
 sion was broad but very weak.
 Thus, 6 digits.  Perhaps this was a Moscow telephone number?  But
 L. D. -- were they initials?  Two hours were required in order to es-
 tablish that at the telephone number B8-16-18 there was no one with the
 initials L.D.  The telephone with this number was the apartment of
 Aleksandr Il'ich Krasovskiy,, a doctor of physical-mathematical sciences,
 who had lived here for many years with his wife Valentina Andryevna,
 mother-in-law Antonina Dmitriyevna Vereshchagina and their son Vladimir,
 a student.
 Studying the Krasovskiy family did not give Roshchin even the
 slightest basis to suspect these people of any improper acts or inten-
 tions.                   A good warm Soviet family, but why would Sclaton have their
 telephone number?  Roshchin decided to visit the Krasovskiys, to have
 a talk with them, and to try to find even the slightest shadow of a
 story which could explain everything.
 The three of them talked together:  Roshchin, Aleksandr Il'ich and
 Valentina Andreyevna.  Roshchin said straight off:  "your telephone
 number was discovered in the possession of a foreigner who is of interest
 to our organs of state security.  Can't you help us to find out why this
 telephone number would be in his possession?  He got it very recently,
 in the second half of December."
 "I can't understand it," said Aleksandr Il'ich, shrugging his
 shoulders.  "I know many foreign scientists, but don't remember giving
 them my home telephone.  I make so secret of it, but I didn't have any
 need to do so...  I don't have any close friends among foreigners...
 Actually, I don't know how to help you..."
 "Do you recall any foreigners phoning you recently?"  asked
 Roshchin.
 "I remember very well that no one called."
 "Perhaps someone other than the members of your family uses the
 phone?"
 "No, no one does."
 "What about people who visit you frequently?"
 "We have many friends and acquaintances," said Aleksandr Ii'ich
 spreading his hands, "but as far as I remember they all have their own
 phones..."
 "Well there is Lyuba...," said Valentina Andryevna.
 "What about Aunt Lyuba?"  Aleksandr Il'ich said to his wife.

 "Aunt Lyuba is the sister of my mother, and her last name is
 Shabolina," explained Valentina Andryevna to Roshchin.  She frequently
 comes over to drink tea with mother, and they chat... You know, old
 people have their own affairs... Aunt Lyuba lives with Valeriy her son
 and they don't have a telephone, and recently she warned my mother that
 she would be phoned, and asked her not to forget that they were to leave
 the telephone number..."
 "And how old is Lyubov'...  What is her patronymic?"  asked Roshchin.
 "Lyubov' Dmitriyevna.  She is 63.  She is somewhat younger than
 mother..."
 "Yes..." said Roshchin with a smile.  "Valentina Andryevna, I have
 a request to make of you.  As soon as your aunt is telephoned and gives
 the telephone number, please tell me.  We want to find out this tele-
 phone number before Lyubov Dmitriyevna does.  All right?"
 "Yes, yes, of course," nodded Valentina Andryevna.
 "Of course, if we must...  We understand..." responded Aleksandr
 Il'ich.
 Roshchin left the Krasovskiys on foot. He wanted to stroll and
 think a bit.  He needed a glass of water.  A 63 year old woman, Lyubov'
 Dmitriyevna, L. D. Shabolina, was a foreign agent?  Nonsense!  What did
 he know about her?  She had lived all of her life in Moscow, she had
 never worked, and 3 years ago had buried her husband.  She lived with
 her son an engineer.  Imagine what a joke it will make when the fellows
 find out that I have solved the mysterious initials L. D.  Nonsense,
 absolute nonsense.  It means either that I must find another person
 with the initals L. D., or ... Lyubov' is the "cover up" and someone is
 using her as the "front."  The apartment of the Krasovskiys was very
 suitable for this.  The old people are there drinking tea. This was
 very plausible.  Then the phone.  One old lady is given a telephone num-
 ber, and she relays it.  To whom?  Should I go to Lyubov' Dmitriyevna and
 have a talk with her? That is dangerous.  The person whose will she is
 following blindly may be near by. That could spoil everything.
 [Synopsis: The KGB soon discovers that Prokhorov has been corre-
 sponding with one Bocharev in Riga, an orthodox priest, and one
 Kuznetsov in Orsk, an old friend from the camp at Pechora; also,
 Prokhorov is receiving mail at various addresses.
 Looking back, the author ponders why Prokhorov should have become
 a traitor to the Soviet Union, and recalls that after his release
 in 1956, Prokhorov had shown cynicism about the sputniks, the dam
 at Bratsk, and the Virgin Lands.]
 There is a word -- ideals.  Sometimes we use it without thinking,
 and then this word dims.  The problem is not in misuse, but in its very
 essence.  What are ideals?  These ultimately, I think are your counting

 of right and wrong, justice and deceit, your evalutation to everything
 that your people and you yourself are doing.  Communist ideals are our
 measuring stick by which we can check the world...  I am always think-
 ing about Prokhorov...  What about his ideals?  Perhaps, he was con-
 vinced that the world of capitalism was freer and happier?  Certainly
 there are a number of people convinced of this. No, I do not think so.
 This conviction could not be found either in his statements or in his
 letters.  He was not interested in economic indices, and he never looked
 at statistical manuals.
 It would seem that a person who is alien to our ideology should
 be excited, for example, by the industry of the US which is ahead of
 us for many of its indices.  But he was excited by the poetry of the
 cafe and romantic "free love."  I had lived in Paris for a short period
 of time but I know nevertheless that the owners of the cafe work hard
 18 hours a day, and that in this beautiful city there is a gigantic
 underground industry of prostitution, an industry, with its own chiefs
 and bosses, borders and laws, supply and demand, and with terrible filth
 and cynicism.  How could he not see this during the years he lived in
 Paris.
 If in our nation he could have consumed continuously without giv-
 ing anything in return, he would have chosen Soviet power.  But since
 it is impossible to live in this manner here, he could not stand Soviet
 power.
 [Synopsis:  Expelled from the church because he had syphilis,
 Prokhorov had gone to work in a bookstore, and dreamed of earning
 large amounts of currency and escaping to the West.  In June 1963
 he persuades a tourist from France to mail a letter for him in
 Paris, addressed to a war-time White Russian acquaintance, Prince
 Nikolay Boryatinsky, who is now teaching at the Navy College in
 Washington; a second letter is taken out by a Soviet geologist
 teaching a course at Cambridge University.  Then Prokhorov makes
 the acquaintance of the son of the Krasovskys' Aunt Lyuba, Valeriy
 Shabolin, who works in a sensitive defense center.  While Shabolin
 is in a drunken stupor, Prokhorov copies secret information from a
 notebook he finds in Shabolin's jacket. Shabolin is furious when
 he discovers this treachery, but is afraid to go to the KGB.
 Prokhorov first tries to peddle the information to an American
 journalist, who is too clever and cautious to accept written ma-
 terial.  He next offers the material to Sclaton, whom he meets at
 an American cultural exhibition; Sclaton likewise refuses to take
 anything, but tells Prokhorov to give him a telephone number; this
 is the number which Roshchin found at the Hotel Ukraina.  Thinking
 over the case--and at this point not knowing exactly what Prokhorov
 is trying to communicate--the police consider having a false "for-
 eigner" use the number to contact Prokhorov.]

 "What do you propose?"  asked the general.
 "Petr Mikhaylovich," Roshchin said quietly but convincingly, "we
 must find out what the intentions of Prokhorov are, and why does he need
 this contact..."
 "How?"  asked the general quickly.  Roshchin understood:  every-
 thing that they had said had been clear to the general from the very
 first words of the report and all of this time he was thinking:    how?
 Kuprin moved his chair forward and the main conversation began.
 "What if we would phone Krasovskiy and give Lyubov' Dmitriyevna
 a telephone number for a contact, huh?"    Kuprin had saved this varia-
 tion until the meeting with the general.                          "Prokhorov will bite and make
 contact.  One of our men will be the 'foreigner.'  And then we will see
 how Prokhorov behaves.  We have one thing to check:  whether we should
 tell the Krasovskiys about this call..."
 The general thought for a second:
 "This is not quite so, Boris Markovich. We have no reason not to
 trust the Krasovskiys.  We have asked for their assistance, and why
 shouldn't we trust them?  We cannot work without trust..."  Once again
 he was quiet.  "And in the second place -- Prokhorov knows that the call
 will be from Sclaton. This would tip him off.  And we must find out
 what he is thinking of. We must know.  And we must do this so as to ex-
 clude any pressure whatsoever upon Prokhorov, upon his will and psyche.
 If he is intending to communicate something to transmit something, we
 on our side must show not only that we are not interested in this, but
 on the contrary, we want to do everything to support his attempt.  Abso-
 lute free will -- only in this case will we obtain reliable information...
 Your idea about the 'foreigner,'  the general turned to Kuprin, "is also
 dubious. This is the extreme case.  But I will allow that under the
 given circumstances such a solution is possible.  Just a minute."  The
 general pressed a button.  The person on duty appeared silently at the
 door.
 "Please ask Aleksandr Nikolayevich to come in," said the general.
 Aleksandr Nikolayevich Vorontsov having heard the request of the
 general to be concerned with Prokhorov as an old police agent under-
 stood that the work was delicate and difficult.
 "Well, my friends," he said turning to Kuprin. Kozin and Roshchin,
 "lets see what we can think up.  Come around and see me and we'll have

 [Synopsis:  The KGB, instead of telephoning, sends a letter to
 Prokhorov, supposedly from a "Catherine Cateway," saying she has
 something for him.  As "Cateway," a KGB agent meets Prokhorov,
 tells him that she intended her letter for another Prokhorov, but
 in the process confirms that he is desperately interested in selling
 information to foreigners.  This means that he is a spy.  Then Mme.
 Krasovskaya, the scientist's wife, informs the KGB that someone has
 called their number and left another number for Aunt Lyuba.  Within
 20 minutes, Roshchin has found out that this is the telephone number
 of the hotel room of a Signor Mario Gozzi, supposedly on an Inturist
 tour from Milan.  Meanwhile, Aunt Lyuba gives the number to Prokhorov,
 who trustfully goes to meet Gozzi; Prokhorov and Gozzi arrange that
 Prokhorov will leave his material in a railroad station locker and
 telephone the locker number to Gozzi's hotel room.  Prokhorov goes
 to the airport and sees Gozzi board a non-stop ;?lane for Paris.
 Actually, unbeknownst to Prokhorov, the KGB has simply had the tour-
 ist from Milan shifted to another room and has substituted a KGB
 agent for him; it is this fictitious Gozzi who meets Prokhorov, ar-
 ranges to pick up his material, and boards the plane--"Gozzi" gets
 off the plane when it stops for "technical reasons" at Riga.  The
 author attends a KGB viewing of a film of Prokhorov placing his ma-
 terial in the locker, and jokes with the KGB officers.]
 "How the devil did you take that?"  I whispered in Roshchin's ear.
 "Just like Yrusevskiy films at the Moscow Film Studio," whispered
 Aleksandr Petrovich back.
 "No, no Joking.  Where did you hide the camera?" I said without
 stopping.
 "If you have to be at the station, how do you think it would be best
 to hide a camera:  in a stack of hay or in a tree stump?" asked Roshchin
 not without some sarcasm.
 "In a suitcase.  Or somehow in a basket," I thought.
 "Smart fellow," whispered Roshchin laughing, "a fine mind..."
 I understand that all of this dialogue sounds like a typical con-
 versation between Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson (incidentally, I
 c-ould never understand why such an incisive person like Sherlock Holmes
 would choose as a friend such a dunce as Watson).
 And Prokhorov was now next to locker 242 on the screen.  A small
 boy with unmasked curiosity approached and was watching Anatoliy
 Yakovlevich set the figures on the lock:  2122.
 "One of your men?"  I whispered to Roshchin.  I wanted to get back
 to the hay stack and stump.

 "one of ours.  Major Pronin made up as an 'October' member.*  And
 write it that way.        So that everything is like a fast-moving detective
 novel..."
 Prokhorov opened the locker.  And once again he looked about. One
 could see that everything bothered him -- from the onlooking boy, to
 the sweeper cleaning the floor and the passengers on the bench.   People
 were strange for him.
 But people did not pay any attention to him.  They were idling,
 reading, talking and eating.   Prokhorov put the letter in the hiding
 place.  But this time it was not in candy, but in a volume of "Eugene
 Onegin."
 Later, when I held this volume in my hands, I suddenly felt hate
 for this person as never before.  Let alone his contemporaries, he be-
 trayed his ancestors, and besmirched Pushkin.
 [Synopsis:  Prokhorov is called up for army retraining at Yaroslavl,
 and this interruption gives the KGB a chance to question his con-
 tacts.  Bocharov in Riga makes no attempt at concealment-]
 He told everything in detail:  when the interrogator requestioned him,
 he nodded politely, willingly, attempting in every way to show his
 readiness to be absolutely frank.  And in fact he had nothing to hide
 as he could not keep anything secret from the police as they had al-
 ready discovered everything.  He only had to substantiate this.  And
 he did...
 Several days later we were in Orsk.
 "Kuznetsov is a tougher nut to crack," said Roshchin.  "He should
 have letters from Prokhorov, and these letters are extremely incriminat-
 ing.                          Therefore the prosecutor has given us permission to search the
 apartment of Kuznetsov.  This is little enough."
 There were three of us in the hotel room:  Roshchin, the prosecutor
 Mikhail Sergeyevich Nakhimov and myself.  We were eating sausage with
 bread and drinking tea.
 "Here is the problem," continued Roshchin, "Kuznetsov has a daughter,
 a little girl in the second grade.  How can we search the place when she
 is there?"  he turned to Nakhimov.  "She would certainly remember this.
 It is a joke, her father being searched!  This would be a scar for all
 of her life..."

 They were quiet.
 "Misha, do you have any children?"  asked Roshchin.
 "Yes I do..."
 "I have two.  I also have a daughter...  She is entering the insti-
 tute.  I don't know if she will make it...                            My wife and I have been
 bothered..."
 "And mine is still wetting the cradle," smiled Nakhimov.
 "That is nonsense...   If mine wet the bed, there would be no non-
 sense..."
 Once again they were quiet...
 "Misha," once again Roshchin asked, "what can we do with the little
 girl?  We have to think of something..."
 "We could ask the wife of Kuznetsov to take her somewhere for a
 little,"  Nakhimov left the sausage.  "Perhaps to her grandmother's...
 For several hours..."
 I do not like "shining" heroes. I do not want to idealize these
 persons.  But I did hear this conversation myself.  It did exist!
 Honestly, two officers of State Security on the eve of a difficult and
 complex interrogation and search were talking about this girl.
 I remember as a school child I use to walk along Dzerzhinskiy Square,
 pass the grey granite large building, and I was always frightened when
 looking at the barrier which surrounded it, with the sentries with frozen
 faces, and their bayonets.  They were protecting the security of my na-
 tion and why then this great timidness and this desire to speak more
 quietly and to go unnoticed? And here I was at this house.  In three
 months of working with the secret police, I had understood a great deal.
 They had spoken long and frankly about the past and the present of our
 organs, about the break with the past, outmoded conceptions and methods,
 and about restoring the true police work norms put down by Dzerzhinskiy.
 And the problem was not to merely renew the cadres of secret police,
 and to attract new, young people, educated in school, higher institutions,
 by the Komsomol, by the party and by all of our life; people for whom
 the 22nd Party Congress has become the highest expression of our thoughts,
 and an expression of the deeply personal and of one who has lived through
 a great deal.  It was not a matter of merely changing the personnel. There
 was a change in the psychology of people which was very complicated and
 refined, not always painless, but always irreversible.

 One of the leaders of our state security organs told me:  "There
 was a time when we felt that the more persons a police agent arrested,
 the better he was working...  And now each arrest forces us to think--
 have I looked everything over, have I stopped on time, and escaped
 from the harmful influence..."  But to say this, and to have this not
 in words but in deeds, requires a great faith and the courage of the
 communists, and a profound recognition of the necessity of an all-
 purifying psychological change.
 Kuznetsov denied everything; he didn't know anything, hadn't
 heard about anything.
 "I was in the camps," he said, "I don't want to go back...  Yes,
 I am afraid, very much afraid...  I know you..."
 Nakhimov had to do virtually the impossible, to convince a mature,
 difficult and embittered person, to break the old and well established
 principle that he was confronted with an enemy.
 "Why do you speak about the camp?"  said Nakhimov.  "It is not a
 question of the camp or of your fear.  We are speaking about life,
 understand this.  You have your home, your favorite work, a wife and
 daughter. Why do you feel that we want to put you behind bars?  Who
 or why does anyone want this?  Why should we, all of us, our people
 wish to multiply the number of enemies?   Think about this.  Understand
 our interest.  If you are an honest man and a patriot, these interests
 cannot help but be yours..."
 Three hours of a difficult and complex conversation.  Three hours
 and the years of a shadowy life ran together.  Kuznetsov fell silent.
 I saw his eyes and I saw how the wolfish persecution of his glance was
 replaced by kind human thoughtfulness.
 "All right," he said rapidly.  "All right.  I will trust you.  For
 the first time I will trust you.  I know that I am a fool, but I will
 trust you.  Give me some paper, and I will write everything myself."
 There is the slang word. "to be broken," that is to confess.  But
 Kuznetsov was not "broken."  He was not pinned to the wall with facts
 and evidence, he was not shown documents which showed his link with
 Prokhorov.  This was not so. We merely spoke with him.  His confession
 was not a f ced capitulation, as he understood that he could not live
 any more like he had...
 The search began at 2 o'clock in the afternoon when his daughter
 was on her way to school.  Incidentally, we found a letter from Prokhorov
 in the belongings of his daughter, a doll with flaxen hair, her favorite
 because it could close her eyes...

 [Synopsis:  Shabolin Is interrogated, and is beside himself with
 fear.  He reveals that Prokhorov has hidden more secret material
 at the home of Sof'ya Alekseyevna Tolehinskaya, a good-hearted old
 woman who is an old friend of Prokhorov's.]
 After talking with Sof'ya Alekseyevna at the investigators, we
 went to her apartment.  We had to find the last hiding place of the spy.
 "I will tell everything!  I will spill the whole thing:  Yes, he
 used to come to see me, he ate, drank and played the guitar...  I have
 nothing to hide, I have done nothing bad," Sof'ya Alekseyevna was un-
 duly excited.  Her face became red, and she looked at the investigator,
 at me, at two neighbors in the apartment who had been invited to the
 search as witnesses, and she sought our sympathy.
 "Relax, Sof'ya Alekseyevna," said Roshchin softly, seating the old
 woman in a chair, "we know that you have done nothing bad.  But Anatoliy
 Yakovlevich was at your place, according to our information, and could
 have kept certain very interesting pieces of paper in your room.
 "Yes: there are:;' Sof'ya Alekseyevna once again jumped up, "there
 are!  Here is a folder with his music..."
 But there was only music in the folder.  Romances.  "You will soon
 come in your officer's overcoat," I read and smiled in spite of myself:
 in fact, they would soon come for him in an officers overcoat...
 But only music and nothing more.
 "Well," said Roshchin to Tolchinskaya, looking through the folder,
 it    must excuse us, but we must search."
 "Please!"  responded Sof'ya Alekseyevna readily.  "If you want I
 will help you."
 "Thank you," smiled Roshchin, "we can do it ourselves..."
 In the infinite variety of human dwellings, one can clearly note
 a category of rooms which is strewn and hung with absolutely unnecessary
 things. This was exactly the category of rooms to which the room of
 Sof'ya Alekseyevna belonged.  Here to find several sheets of paper was
 truly a Herculean task.
 Roshchin leafed through all books, stacks of old yellowed news-
 papers and pencils.  Everything.  Roschin shook a briefcase, turned it
 over and shook it again.  Dust.  Crumbs.  He ran his hand inside and
 felt a slit in the lining.  Pressing his hand in further he pulled out
 a small packet.  Several sheets of paper with fine writing on them were
 on the table.

 "Here it is.  And this is no musical dictionary," smiled Roshchin
 to Sof'ya Alekseyevna.  He extended the papers to the witnesses.
 "And all of the numbers!" said one of the women in terror.  She
 held the paper in the tips of her fingers as if it was a leaf of a
 poisonous plant.
 The search continued.
 "Today 'Spartak' doesn't seem to be playing," said Vorontsov, "and
 therefore I hope Boris Markovich will not be watching the clock, and we
 can have a talk without hurrying.  It is time to sum up..."
 "'Spartak' is playing, but in Tbilisi," returned Kuprin, "and this
 circumstance will play a fatal role for Anatoliy Yakovlevich."
 "I feel that we should talk not so much about Prokhorov," said
 Vorontsov, "as about Kuznetsov, Inozemtsev [a thick-headed friend of
 Prokhorov's] and Shabolin.  As long as they are involved with Prokhorov,
 they will fall.  Perhaps not fall but slide."
 "Where is there farther to slide?" returned Kuprin.  "A man has
 worked at a defense enterprise and it is bad enough that he has violated
 the elementary regulations of handling secret documents, but has con-
 sciously turned them over to the enemy.  Shabolin could not help but know
 that Prokhorov wanted to sell the information received from him!  No mat-
 ter what you say, I will, never believe this!"
 "And nevertheless," began Vorontsov, without hurrying, "and never-
 theless, what sort of person is Shabolin?  A fellow 26 years old.                             Raised
 without a father.  For a boy this is very important, a father...  He
 finished Soviet school and a Soviet institution of higher learning.  How
 could he be an enemy?  Kuznetsov also, evidently, did a lot of thinking
 in the camp.  At present he is working... He has a wife and daughter...
 You say 'I will never believe it.'  These merely are emotions.  The prob-
 lem is not one of intuition.                         We must look into the soul of the man, and
 see just how sick it is, this soul, and whether or not it can be cured.
 So let us not hurry with our conclusions, there will be an investigation
 and we will gain a complete picture of everything that happened.  Let us
 determine precisely the measure of their involvement in this case.  And
 then let the law decide to what degree shall Shabolin, Inozemtsev and
 Kuznetsov are guilty.  It would be no problem to slap them down...  It
 would be more difficult to keep them up."
 "Correct," agreed Kozin, "I don't think that they are lost to us..."
 "Remember," continued Vorontsov, "there have been a good number of
 cases when persons at first glance were lost and then were literally re-
 born.  They were caught, talked to, they went to work, they got advice
 from the family, from friends, from the Komsomol, from the party cells,

 and the person changed.  Not immediately, initially with caution, but
 they matured and understood that they were being helped and would not
 be thrown into prison..."
 [Synopsis:  At Yaroslavl, Prokhorov claims he is ill and requests
 a medical examination.  The KGB has obtained a warrant for
 Prokhorov's arrest, and three officers and the author drive to
 Yaroslavl to pick Prokhorov up.]
 We arrived at Yaroslavl' near evening.  At the oblast administra-
 tion of the KGB, we were Joined by two investigators.  We discussed the
 plan of arrest.  Prokhorov was in a hospital ward with other patients.
 To arrest him there was rather bad -- we would begin with chatter:
 he would tell us where he was hurtinrg, and he would demand that he be
 sent to Moscow to specialist professors.  It was decided that Kuprin
 would enter the ward as a physician and tell Prokhorov that he was to
 be sent to Moscow, and could make sure that Prokhorov did not leave any-
 thing in the night table -- it was very possible that he might keep cer-
 tain records on himself at.al.l times, not trusting any hiding place.
 Kuprin played the role of a physician like a professional actor.
 He did not go up to Prokhorov directly, he chatted with the patients,
 he felt the stomach of one, inspected the tongue of another, said some-
 thing in Latin, and made notes in his pad.
 "Prokhorov?  so, so..." he stopped in front of a thin man with high
 cheek-bones.  He had black hair combed back.  He had penetrating eyes.
 He was completely quiet.  "You will go to Moscow, Prokhorov.  Your serv-
 ice is finished.                         We have taken a routine analysis, routine," said Kup-
 rin, "you must be cured..."
 In fifteen minutes Prokhorov, hiding with difficulty his joy that
 his deceit had suceeded so brilliantly, was already coming down the
 stairs with a suitcase in his hand.
 "Anatoliy Yakovlevich," Kuprin touched him on the sleeve.  "Follow
 me for a minute, please."  Kuprin opened the door of the duty office.
 Prokhorov went in.  He looked at the blue edging on the shoulder straps
 of the major-investigator.
 "Are you Prokhorov, Anatoliy Yakovlevich?" asked the major.
 "Yes, what is the matter?"
 "Your documents please."
 Prokhorov showed his passport.
 "Prokhorov, Anatoliy Yakovlevich, born 1922," the major read out
 loud. "That's it," he said to Roshchin.

 Roshchin looked at Prokhorov.  He had been thinking about this
 man for a year night and day.  For a year he had talked with him, argued,
 changed his mind, studied, hoped and was deceived in his hopes, studied
 his psychology, thought his thoughts and finally declared war on him.
 This invisible duel had gone on for a year.  Now he saw him for the
 first time.
 "According to a warrant from the deputy of the chief military pro-
 secutor, you are arrested and accused under article 64 of the Penal Code
 of the RSFSR," said the major.
 "What?  What did you say?" asked Prokhorov amazed.  "What was the
 article?"
 "Treason to the motherland," said the major showing him the decree:
 "read it and sign."
 His face was completely quiet, and only his hands betrayed him.
 The sheet of paper shook slightly like a man reading in the car of a
 moving train.
 "There has been a misunderstanding," said Prokhorov dryly, "there
 has been some mistake..."
 "We will see," said Roshchin quietly standing behind him.
 Prokhorov turned around.
 ...It was completely dark.  Prokhorov was sitting in the car be-
 tween Roshchin and myself.  He was quiet and looked ahead, beyond the
 grey road, beyond the headlights into the night.
 In the aims of conspiracy, the workers in counter-intelligence had
 given Prokhorov the alias "Jesuit."  This pseudonym was born by accident,
 but it seemed to me amazingly accurate.  During the night of 2 October
 1964, the "Jesuit" ceased to be.  And there appeared in his place Anatoliy
 Prokhorov who was under investigation.

 Soviet "Aid"
 "In recent years the leaders of the CPSU have habitually played the
 benefactor and frequently boasted of their 'disinterested assistance.'
 When commemorating the 14th anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet
 Treaty of Friendship.. Alliance and Mutual Assistance in February this
 year, Pravda., Izvestia and other Soviet propaganda media again beat the
 drum to the sametun  We have not yet made a systematic reply in the
 press, but we must point out that, so far from being gratis, Soviet aid
 to China was rendered mainly in the form of trade and that it was cer-
 tainly not a one-way affair.  China has paid and is paying the Soviet
 Union in goods, gold or convertible foreign exchange for all Soviet-
 supplied complete sets of equipment and other goods, including those
 made available on credit plus interest.  It is necessary to add that the
 prices of many of the goods we imported from the Soviet Union were much
 higher than those on the world market....
 "As for the Soviet loans to China, it must be pointed out that China
 used them mostly for the purchase of war materiel from the Soviet Union,
 the greater part of which was used up in the war to resist U.S. aggres-
 sion and aid Korea.  In the war against U.S. aggression the Korean people
 carried by far the heaviest burden and sustained by far the greatest
 losses.  The Chinese people, too, made great sacrifices and incurred vast
 military expenses. The Chinese Communist Party has always considered
 that this was the Chinese people's bounden internationalist duty and that
 it is nothing to boast of.  For many years we have been paying the princi-
 pal and interest on these Soviet loans, which account for a considerable
 part of our yearly exports to the Soviet Union.  Thus even the war mate-
 riel supplied to China in the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid
 Korea has not been given gratis....
 "Your action [the withdrawal of Soviet experts from China] fully
 demonstrates that you violate the principle of mutual assistance between
 socialist countries and use the sending of experts as an instrument for
 exerting political pressure on fraternal countries, butting into their
 internal affairs and impeding and sabotaging their socialist construction."
 (Letter of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China of
 February 29, 1961, to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the
 Soviet Union, Peking Review, 8 May 1961+.
 "Do you know, Soviet comrades, that the traitor Nikita Khrushchev
 and his fellows have compelled the Chinese comrades to pay for the arma-
 ments provided generously by the great Stalin for the Korean fight?  Your
 treacherous leadership is but an arms merchant, just as that notorious
 adventurer, Zakharov.  How can one trust these unscrupulous and dishonest
 men?  And now what does your treacherous leadership do in the Vietnam war?

 It blames China and alleges slanderously that she does not permit the
 sending of old armaments which it has earmarked for Vietnam.  In point
 of fact these obsolete arms are insignificant and miserable....
 "The Khrushchev revisionists are openly playing a dangerous game at
 the expense of the Vietnamese people, socialism and peace.   The diaboli-
 cal aim of the Soviet renegades is to get the Democratic Republic of
 Vietnam into their net by  undertaking an operation to allegedly send arms
 and volunteers to that country.  This 'operation' is presently being car-
 ried out through the hot war started by the Americans.
 "This action by the Soviet revisionists, allegedly against U.S.
 imperialism and providing 'aid' to the DRV, is accompanied by U.S. bomb-
 ings, which will only stop in the culmination of the Soviet operation --
 that is, when so-called Soviet 'volunteers,' as alleged  experts, rocket
 technicians, and so forth, have occupied key places in Vietnam."

 the U.S. Imperialists in their Aggression against Vietnam,"  Zeri-i-
 Popullit (Tirana), 20 April 1965.)
