USSR- Gas Pipeline Construction Delayed 
EASTERN EUROPE: 
Disagreements between the USSR and East Europeans over the 
financing of pipeline construction threaten to delay Moscow's 
gas export plans 
The USSR is demanding that the East Europeans pay hard currency 
for the pipe used on segments of the Progress gas pipeline assigned 
to them, A Soviet demand that East 
Germany make a lump-sum payment to the USSR for its pipe 
contribution was rejected by East Berlin. The USSR has now agreed 
to allow East Germany to buy the pipe on credit from West Germany, 
but differences remain over delivery schedules. 
Meanwhile, Romania and Bulgaria have delayed construction of the 
transit gas pipeline to Greece in an attempt to force the Soviets to 
reimburse them more for hard currency purchases of Western 
equipment and for the services of Hungarian and Yugoslav 
subcontractors. 
Comment: Haggling over the terms of East European participation in 
joint projects is common, but negotiations have to be completed soon 
if the projects are to be incorporated into economic plans for 1986-90 
and be finished by target dates in 1987. Long delays in constructing 
high-priority gas pipelines might set back Moscow's plans for 
Increasing gas shipments to Eastern Europe instead of oil and for 
Increasing gas deliveries  to the West to offset declining oil export 
revenues. 
The Soviets have said that joint investments are necessary if energy 
deliveries are to be maintained, but East Europeans have been 
unenthusiastic about the Progress pipeline because of the large 
investment requirements and the vague terms for Soviet gas 
deliveries. Large hard currency outlays, which may cost each country 
several hundred million dollars, would undermine the fragile hard 
currency positions of especially Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, and 
Romania.

CHINA-USSR: Officials Comment on Relations 
Chinese officials are expressing pessimism about the prospects for 
Sino-Soviet relations, probably to counter recent Soviet attempts to 
portray ties as improving. According to a West German press 
account, Deng Xiaoping indicated privately to Christian Socialist 
leader Franz Josef Strauss last Friday that General Secretary 
Gorbachev had failed to capitalize on "considerable possibilities" for 
progress. Deng also disparaged Gorbachev's recent strategic arms 
reduction proposal as not going far enough. The spokesman for the 
Chinese party's International Liaison Department ruled out resuming 
interparty relations with Moscow until progress is made on the "three 
obstacles"?Afghanistan, Cambodia, and Soviet forces on China's 
borders. The spokesman specifically discounted Soviet press 
accounts of the recent meeting between the Soviet and Chinese 
Foreign Ministers that su ested progress had been made on party-
to-party relations. 
Comment: By speaking out during the current round of Sino-Soviet 
talks, the Chinese appear determined to prevent the Soviets from 
gaining leverage over the US before the meetings in Geneva in the  
absence of concessions from Moscow.

UGANDA: Rebels Press Army 
Insurgent leader Museveni has returned to Uganda from Tanzania to 
command his forces as the  rebels besieae three aovernment 
garrisons in the southwest, 
Government resupply and reinforcement efforts at Masaka, 80 miles 
(130 kilometers) southwest of Kampala, have failed, and the rebels 
have reaained control of Mitvana 35 miles (55 kilometers) west of the 
capital, The government continues to 
ferry troops to Kampala from the north. Meanwhile numerous reports 
persist of Army brutality toward civilians. 
Comment: The rebels are likely to expand and intensify their 
operations soon. A major attack on Kampala is not Imminent, but the 
Insurgents may attempt a dramatic military move today?the 23rd 
anniversary of Uganda's independence. The government of President 
Okello lacks popular support and is beset by military defeats, 
economic difficulties, and internal divisions. Its prospects for survival 
are dwindling.

Special Analysis 
SOUTH AFRICA: The Zulu Factor 
Chief Buthelezi and his powerful Zulu-dominated Inkatha 
organization are growing increasingly isolated on the black 
political scene because of their consistent moderation toward 
the government in a year of growing black militancy. Clashes 
between inkathe supporters and members of other nonwhite 
groups are likely to become increasingly violent as the unrest 
continues. 
Buthelezi's position as Chief Minister of the KwaZulu homeland has 
earned him the reputation of a progovernment collaborator and the 
enmity of some nonwhite protest groups, which also dislike his vocal 
opposition to international sanctions against Pretoria. In addition, 
many black activists believe that, because virtually all of Inkatha's 
1 million members are Zulus, it reinforces Pretoria's goal of 
preserving?and exploiting?tribal distinctions. 
Most black groups and the white opposition all view Buthelezi as a 
force still to be reckoned with, despite his aberrant views. Many black 
groups loathe lnkatha but respect its Influence among the Zulus who 
are quick to display their warrior heritage when challenged. 
The Progressive Federal Party, the official white opposition, has 
persuaded Inkatha to join its new "convention alliance," designed to 
unite antiapartheid groups. The African National Congress and the 
United Democratic Front so far have not joined the alliance, which 
severely limits its effectiveness. Their reluctance reflects continued  
antagonism toward groups with ties to the apartheid system 
Relations With ANC and United Democratic Front 
Buthelezi, a former member of the ANC, has had stormy relations with 
it since a falling out in 1979. He repeatedly has alleged that the ANC 
wants to kill him, and he also has denounced the two-year-old Front, 
echoing government allegations that it is closely linked to the ANC. 
Buthelezi blasted the ANC in a recent speech, warning that its armed 
struggle would result In a  humiliating defeat against the superior 
might of the government. 
ANC officials have countered Buthelezi's recent diatribe with charges 
that he is out of step with the evolving political situation. The ANC 
also bombed three shops in Durban late last month on the eve of the 
Zulu rally, claiming later that the attacks were in support of a black

consumer boycott of local white stores?an action Inkatha opposed. 
The timin of the o erations suggests they were intended to undercut 
Buthelezi. 
The struggle between Inkatha afid groups affiliated with the United 
Democratic Front in Durban's black townships?especially 
Lamontville?often has resulted in violence this year. At least eight 
blacks were killed in Lamontville late last month when Inkatha 
members battled local residents who earlier had attacked several 
Inkatha youths. 
Outlook 
The government probably will try to capitalize further on black 
differences and move to cement its relationship with Buthelezi, 
although recently It has sent him mixed signals. Last month it 
proposed adjustments to KwaZulu's boundaries that anaered 
Buthelezi, according to press reports. 
The press also reported that, at the same time, Pretoria may invite 
Buthelezi and the Zulus to join a regional power-sharing government 
In Natal Province. Many white proponents of the plan, however, 
believe Pretoria risks losing Buthelezi if it does not meet his 
prerequisite for talks by providing a general blueprint of its reform 
plans. They also believe they must grant him some concessions to 
show that his moderate approach is productive. 
Buthelezi probably will continue to preach the futility of confrontation, 
thereby ensuring he will remain at odds with the Front and the ANC. 
He will occasionally allow attacks by his supporters against Inkatha's 
rivals on the black political front, while continuing to put himself in a 
position to take advantaqe of any major concessions by the 
government.

Special Analysis 
USSR: The Campaign Against Corruption 
Building on the program started by his political mentor, Yuriy 
Andropov, General Secretary Gorbachev has revived the 
campaign against corruption and made it a major program of his 
regime. He is using it to remake the bureaucracy, strengthen his 
control over regional officials, and irmidate those who might 
resist his policies  
Gorbachev has removed a number of corrupt provincial leaders and 
has indicated that freedom from corruption would become a criterion 
for holding political office. In his first weeks in office, he dismissed the 
Minister of Power and Electrification, who had been implicated in a 
scandal, uncovered while Andropov was in office, involving the 
diversion of state funds to build a villa. 
Eduard Shervardnadze, known for his tough anticorruption stance, is 
said to have been brought in as Foreign Minister over other 
candidates when the KGB found the Foreign Ministry to be a major 
haven of corruption. There have also been rumors that Moscow party 
chief Grishin is vulnerable to charges of corruption. An article by the 
Moscow leader in Pravda last April was defensive on this score, which 
suggests he is feeling some heat. 
The earlier crisis in Poland may have been an object lesson for the 
Soviets. Soviet media had suggested that corruption by high officials 
in Poland was the chief cause of the gulf between workers and the 
party and of the disaffection and turmoil there. 
Gorbachev hopes that the publicity endorsina stronaer anticorruotion 
measures will Improve the regime's image. 
earlier the party's tolerance and use of corruption for its nwn nain hari  
caused it to lose support across a broad spectrum. 
The General Secretary knows that trying to stop political corruption 
altogether would require extending KGB involvement in affairs as 
Stalin had done. This would needlessly raise fears even among his 
supporters. Rather than try to destroy the hydra of corruption 
altogether, Gorbachev has more limited goals in mind. He will use the 
campaign to further his objective of remaking the bureaucracy and 
strengthening his control over officials outside Moscow. He will have 
an easier time bringing officials who fight his policies Into line because 
almost all are vulnerable to charges of corruption 
Gorbachev probably can count on the support of several key 
segments of the elite for expanding the anticorruption campaign?the 
KGB, your n nartv members An 
pr for ar vancement, and economic 
i 
reformers.

Special Analysis 
FRANCE: Socialist Party Congress 
Shaken by their poor electoral prospects and internal rivalries, 
the French Socialists gather on Friday to decide their strategy for 
the legislative election next spring. Moderates probably will lose 
to the left wing, further weakening the party. 
With polls Indicating that only 23 percent of the electorate intend to 
vote for the Socialists, the party is debating how to revive its support. 
The left and center have rallied behind First Secretary Jospin, who 
wants to mobilize party militants and leftist sympathizers throughout 
the electorate with a hard-hitting, partisan campaign. The party's left 
has never been comfortable with a policy that accepts unemployment 
as the price of modernization. Rather than defend the government's 
policy of austerity, they would prefer to stress the dangers of a return 
to power by the conservatives. Jospin wants the party to maintain the 
purity of its principles by refusing electoral alliances with either 
Communists or centrists; he would accept defeat rather than 
compromise. 
For the first time since 1979, the Socialists will not be unanimously 
backing a motion on party policy because of a rival motion by former 
Agriculture Minister Rocard. Under his leadership, the party's right 
wing will strongly endorse the austerity policy being carried out by 
Prime Minister Fabius. Rocardhopes that by stressing responsible 
management of the economy the Socialists can make allies of centrist 
forces and retain a share of power by entering a coalition. The party 
leadership was jolted when Rocard's alternative motion garnered 
nearly 30 percent of the vote in regional meetings preceding the 
congress. 
President Mitterrand wants to appear nonpartisan as he faces the 
prospect of governing after the election with a legislature dominated 
by his opponents, and he probably will not intervene publicly in the 
debate over party strategy. 
Jospin almost certainly will command a majority of the delegates at 
the congress. Socialist moderates are likely to accept the decision of 
the congress, but their lack of enthusiasm probably will further 
weaken the party's campaign. Fabius and Rocard?who almost 
certainly have accepted the inevitability of defeat in 1986?will bide 
their time until after the election. Then, with an eye on the 1988 
presidential race, they probably will blame the discredited leftist 
strategy for the Socialist defeat

Special Analysis 
INTERNATIONAL: Impact of a Cutoff of Persian Gulf Oil 
Iraq's recent attacks against the Khark Island oil export terminal 
increase the risk that Tehran may move to interdict oil shipments 
from other Persian Gulf states. The oil market could easily 
absorb a loss of exports from Iran, Iraq, and Kuwait; a serious 
problem would arise only if Saudi exports were also cut. 
Persian Gulf countries are now exporting about 7.5 million barrels per 
day, accounting for about one-fifth of total non-Communist oil 
supplies. Of this, some 6 million b/d flow through the Strait of 
Hormuz, with the remainder shipped through pipelines from Saudi 
Arabia and Iraq to the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. In the first 
quarter of 1985, Western Europe, Japan, and the US relied on the 
region for about 18 percent, 58 percent, and 4 percent, respectively, 
of their total oil imports. 
Excess productive capacity and weak demand currently provide 
considerable?but possibly ephemeral?protection against an oil 
supply cutoff. Surplus capacity available to offset a supply shortfall 
currently is about 11 million b/d, but only about 3 million b/d of this 
lies outside the Gulf region. Commercial inventories, moreover, now 
provide only a small cushion against an interruption, because 
companies have reduced usable stocks to about 100-200 million 
barrels, the equivalent of no more than four days of total consumption 
needs, as compared with a level of about 20 to 25 days in the early 
1980s. Compulsory inventories held by companies in Europe and 
sizable government-owned stocks in the US, Japan, and West 
Germany could provide an additional cushion in the event of a cutoff. 
Likely Market Reaction 
The impact of a disruption of Persian Gulf oil exports would depend 
on its severity, duration, the availability of supplies from other 
producers, and the use of strategic stockpiles. If Baghdad knocks out 
the Khark terminals and Iran retaliates by severing Iraq's pipeline 
through Turkey and by interdicting Kuwaiti exports, nearly 5 million 
b/d of export capacity would be lost. Although other countries could 
replace these lost supplies by raising their outit mi tnh rEf the  
existing surplus capacity would then evaporate. 
14 
continued 
Top Secret 
9 October 1985 
..e  
Under these circumstances, the uncertainties surrounding the 
duration of the disruption and the fear of a much more serious 
shortage resulting from a cutoff of Saudi exports would cause spot 
prices to rise. As long as Saudi export capabilities remained intact, 
however, the market would retain a substantial ability to adjust 
without a major price increase. 
The elimination of all oil exports from the Persian Gulf, coupled with 
the Interruption of oil flow through the Iraq-Turkey pipeline, would 
entail the loss of nearly 14 million b/d of productive capacity. 
Denial for a prolonged period would cause a net supply shortfall of 
3-4 million b/d, almost double the size of the shortage caused by the 
Iranian revolution in 1979. Under these circumstances, prices would 
increase sharply and the global economic recovery would be 
Interrupted. 
Implications for the US 
The US is far less dependent on Persian Gulf oil supplies than its allies 
but has a large stake in the continued flow of oil from the region. The 
US could not insulate itself from a major disruption because it would 
share the burden of a net oil supply shortage as prices rose and as oil 
companies diverted supplies in response to market pressures. 
Moreover, if an emergency caused oil supplies to be allocated 
according to the International Energy Agency's sharing agreement, 
there could be a significantiversion of oil from the US market to 
4T1  
Western Europe and Japan.
