China: Pressuring Japan Over Technology Transfer 
Summary 
During the last half of 1987, China reacted to tighter Japanese 
technology transfer controls with high-level protests and measures to 
redirect trade away from Japan. Japan's subsequent easing of export 
controls and other measures temporarily stilled Beijing's protests, but we 
believe Beijing's policies remain unchanged, reflecting deep-seated 
concern over Japanese technology transfer policy. Beijing's long-term 
strategy of reducing its technological dependence on Japan will continue 
to erode the Japanese market share of China's low-to-medium technology 
imports, although for at least the near-term Japan will probably remain a 
significant source of equipment and high-technology goods. China also 
will continue to seek advanced technology and training from Japan.

We believe Beijing will continue to press Japan to increase. 
technology transfer. Sino-Japanese frictions over technology trade 
probably will not increase sales for US firms, however; European 
firms--often offering preferential financial  terms--are the more likely 
beneficiaries. 
China's Complaints 
Frictions in Sino-Japanese technology trade intensified in mid-1987 when Beijing 
publicly objected to stricter Japanese export controls, and to a one-year ban on exports 
from Toshiba Machine Tools to Communist countries because the company had illegally 
sold sensitive technology to the Soviet Union. Deng Xiaoping and other Chinese 
officials protested the restrictions, claiming they hurt China more than the Soviet Union. 
Charging that the Japanese were conspiring to deny technology to China. Beijing said it 
regarded thP case as a crucial issue in Sino-Japanese relations.. At the same time. 
anger because a Japanese court awarded Taiwan .a dormitory also claimed by China,1 
and a Japanese politician's comment that Deng was out of touch with current realities in 
Sino-Japanese relations heightened Beijing's displeasure toward Tokyo. 
These irritants caused Beijing to  strengthen efforts to redirect trade away from 
Japan in an attempt to pressure Tokyo. Beijing issued a 
national directive, probably in early June, to restrict imports from Japan, and to 
substitute either products from other countries or products made in China 
A Guangdong provincial official 
told US Consulate officers that the policy specified downgrading Japanese participation 
in the strategic areas of electric power and telecommunications. 
Officials involved in technology acquisition quickly began to act on the policy: 
? The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade (MOFERT) ordered an end 
to machinery imports from Japan in early July. 
? In August, petrochemical industry officials stated that Beijing's unhappiness with 
Japan over several issues was responsible for ending Japanese participation in 
building petrochemical plants. 
? A vice manager of China t National Metallurgical Import and Export Corporation 
said China is reducing the amount of machine tools, as well as steel, purchased 
from Japan. 
? A provincial official told a US Consulate General officer in September that none 
of the six Japanese companies bidding on a Guangdong pump storage project 
would be selected, regardless of the cost of their proposals, as a result of the 
new policy.

? A Guangdong telecommunications official told US. officials that although 
negotiations for the import of Japanese switching equipment had been 
completed. Beijing ordered Guangdong to cut the purchase in half. 
In October, Beijing announced it had chosen a consortium of US and European 
firms over two Japanese firms to provide equipment for Shanghai's Shidongkou 
power station. Mitsubishi and Hitachi had both aggressively  sought the contract 
and were viewed by foreign observers as strong contenders. 
The Japanese Response 
Japan first sought to minimize bilateral strains over technology transfer by 
lessening the impact of the ban on Toshiba exports. After ordering Toshiba Machine 
Company to find other firms capable of fulfilling its contracts with China, the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI) sent the Director General of its Trade 
Administration Bureau to Beijing in mid-October to discuss the Toshiba ban. He offered 
to either substitute other companies' goods, or have Toshiba pay a penalty and deliver 
the goods at the end of the ban; he also said Tokyo was seeking a way to partially lift 
the ban to allow some Toshiba exports to China. The Japanese official argued that the 
effect of the Toshiba case on transfers to China was a result of temporary bureaucratic 
shortcomings--too few export control officials overwhelmed by an increasing number of 
licensing requests--rather than a conscious attempt to restrict transfers to China. In 
December, MITI formally announced its decision to partially lift the Toshiba ban and later 
in the month authorized the first Toshiba shipment to China under the new rules. 
25X1 
Furthermore, in early November Japan excluded China from new, stricter 
amendments to its export control laws for technology sales to Communist countries. In 
discussions with US officials, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said that, although 
China was exempt from the amendments, Tokyo would continue to monitor closely 
exports to China. He said "the fine print" explained how this worked, noting that China's 
exemption was a "political judgment made at the highest political levels." To further 
expedite licensing requests, in mid-December MITI added three items--silicon, infrared 
imaging cameras, and radio receivers--to the list of COCOM items for export to China 
that would be handled as administrative exceptions without referral to COCOM. 
Although Beijing temporarily lowered its public posture on technology transfer 
following these moves and the 'Change of leadership in Japan last October--Zhao Ziyang, 
Li Peng, and other leaders began stressing positive aspects of the relationship in public 
speeches--we believe Chinese policy remains unchanged. Beijing reportedly reissued its 
internal trade restrictions in late October, calling for purchases of goods from Europe 
and the United States, even if Japanese prices are lower, and specifying that all items 
requiring approval from a State Council Ministry would be denied if the supplier was 
Japan. there were further restrictions on 
contracts with Japan beginning in late November or early December, and US consulate 
officials and businessmen report that many Chinese officials involved in commercial 
negotiations continue to redirect imports from Japan.

In late December, Beijing once again made its case public as the Chinese press 
published articles highlighting the harm suffered from the Toshiba ban, and several firms 
filed claims for damages. Since January, MOFERT officials have repeatedly said China 
was not satisfied with the  Japanese plan to handle the disputed contracts and continued 
to demand compensation. 
Impact on Chinese Firms 
Japan's controls have delayed projects and limited 
Chinese access to Japanese technology. The one-year ban on all Toshiba Machine Tool 
exports to Communist countries froze 25 Chinese contracts worth between $12.5 and 
17 million. The contracts involve both equipment and installation and maintenance 
services of Japanese technicians. According to Chinese press reports, the ban forced 
some Chinese factories to postpone or cancel production plans--entailing significant 
financial losses--and jeopardized air safety by preventing deliver/ of radar needed- for 
air traffic control in several cities. 
Beijing claims that tighter Japanese export screening procedures have prevented 
companies other than Toshiba from fulfilling contracts with China worth more than 
$7 million--including equipment for high-priority projects. For example, a shipment of 
Japanese cellular phones needed for the All-China Games was delayed because of the 
tighter procedures, Japanese firms have blamed 
closer MITI scrutiny for other delays including deliveries of software needed to operate a 
radar in Chengdu, and machinery for a power plant in Dalian. According to some 
officials, the processing time for license applications has increased by up to six months. 
MITI pressure, including several ongoing 
investigations of possible export violations, is slowing sales and making Japanese firms 
more cautious in dealing with China. Chinese MOFERT officials report that Japanese 
requests for end-user certificates are increasing significantly because Japanese firms 
have begun applying for export licenses for equipment previously exported without one, 
just to be safe. Chinese firms, for example, complain that imports of medical 
instruments have required more time since Japanese firms have been seeking approval 
from export control authorities. Japanese controls have also prevented firms from 
offering other technology and equipment to China: 
? 
In August, Sumitomo--at Mill's suggestion, 
 --decided not to offer rare earth magnet technology to China, despite 
Chinese concessions, to avoid dealing with export controls for COCOM-restricted 
technology. 
? MITI refused to allow Hitachi to display special optical fibers at a Beijing 
exhibition in October 1987, and forced two other exhibitors  to alter their 
? equipment,

? MITI reportedly has also prohibited Japanese firms from displaying their most 
advanced semiconductor production equipment at a show to be held in the 
spring of 1988. 
Pressure To Continue 
Even if the remaining Toshiba cases--the most obvious irritants in the 
technology transfer relationship--are resolved, we believe China will continue to press 
the Japanese government as well as Japanese firms to increase technology transfer. 
Beijing has long resented the reluctance of Japanese firms to transfer advanced 
technology to China, and some officials have charged that it is Japanese government 
policy to keep Chinese technology levels 10-15 years behind Japan. -According to 
MOFERT statistics, only 18 percent of China's total contracts for production lines and 
know-how were with Japan in 1986, compared to 47  percent with European suppliers 
and 15 percent with the United States., Furthermore. 
Japanese transfers of production lines and know-how dropped by 
45 percent during the first half of 1987. Although China's efforts to find new technology 
suppliers contributed to the decline, Chinese officials will undoubtedly blame Japanese 
firms for their unwillingness to transfer technology. 
The recent Japanese relaxation of export controls is unlikely to buy them much 
goodwill, as China's reissuance of guidance restricting Japanese imports in late October 
and December indicates. In its technology transfer relationship with the United States, 
for example, China has expressed polite appreciation for liberalized controls, reminded 
US officials that they are only giving China its due, and proceeded to press for more 
concessions. We believe Beijing is likely to be even more demanding of Japan. The 
relative advantages of doing business with Japan due to geographic proximity are 
countered by deep-seated traditional animosities, compounded by China's perception 
that Japan treats it badly regarding technology transfer 
In the aftermath of the Toshiba case, as well as the Silkworm missile controversy 
with the United States, China is likely to be even more sensitive about technology 
transfer, and more unwilling to suffer real or perceived discrimination from Japan. China 
probably will not hesitate to raise the technology transfer issue with Tokyo in the future 
if it becomes more aware of either repeated denials or delays of technology or if key 
items of technology are denied. For example, Beijing will closely monitor Japanese 
policies on access to supercorrbEiuters?Japanese firms reportedly are considering 
submitting an export license for sales to China. Similarly, Chinese pressure will increase 
prior to COCOM meetings, but we believe Japan is unlikely to make major concessions 
in response to additional Chinese pressure. Tokyo views most technology transfer 
decisions as a private sector matter, and in COCOM, has demonstrated that national 
security is its major concern.

A Selective Policy of Trade Redirection 
25X1 
25X1 
Beijing also will continue to redirect technology trade away from Japan, in our 
opinion, particularly in selected areas, as demonstrated in Beijing's policy to cut 
purchases of telecommunications and power plant equipment. China chose sectors in 
which Japanese companies have been very successful--indeed. Beijing was concerned 
about Tokyo's dominant market share--and had expectations, of further success. Both 
are among China's development priorities for the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-90) and 
are slated for considerable investment. But the rising value of the yen and the. 
availability of other suppliers allowed Beijing to use these areas to send Japan a 
message. 
Advanced Technological Know-how and Goods. Beijing has limited its efforts to 
redirect purchases, however, recognizing that in many cases Japan is the best, or only, 
supplier of high-priority technologies. Even during the heightened tensions of recent 
months. for example. Chinese officials continued to seek Japanese technology and 
purchases in many areas. Japan is the best source of technology for color television 
tubes--one of five top priorities for the electronics industry during the 1986-90 
period--and in late 1986 and 1987 China awarded several major contracts for color 
television tube production to Japanese firms. In January 1988, China concluded an 
agreement with Hitachi for video tape recorder manufacturing equipment and 
technology, according to press reports. The Japanese share of China's purchases of 
high-technology goods2 has remained fairly constant over the past few years at slightly 
more than one-fourth: sales to China of high-technology microelectronics goods have 
increased; sales of high-technology telecommunications products are on the upswing 
after a drop in 1985; sales of advanced machine tools and medicine and biologicals 
peaked in 1984 and have dropped somewhat since; sales of high-technology computer 
equipment, chemicals, microelectronics, and scientific and precision instruments have 
remained fairly steady3 (see figures 1 and 2). 
China is also engaged in joint research projects with Japan in artificial 
intelligence and robotics research, and has expressed interest in working together in 
areas such as Stealth technology, biotechnology, and microelectronics. Chinese 
willingness to cooperate in high-priority areas such as these is unlikely to be affected, 
by any chill in relations (see inset). 
3 
? 
? 
High-technology goods are defined as items in eight areas for which research and 
development expenditures tend to constitute a significant share of the final product 
costs. The eight categories are: telecommunications, ADP equipment, 
microelectronics, machine tools, aerospace, scientific and precision instruments, 
medicine and biologicals, and chemicals. Analysis of trade in high-technology goods 
is based on UN statistics; China's published trade data do not provide the level of 
detail needed to differentiate high technology from other technology goods. UN 
statistics include data from most major partners, but not the Soviet Bloc. 
Japanese firms provide only a fraction of China's aerospace imports.

Sino-Japanese Cooperation in Research and Training 
In addition to technology trade, China looks to Japan for cooperation in 
research and training for student's and industrial workers. Chinese and 
Japanese scholars are conducting joint research and technological exchanges 
under governmental agreements and academic and industrial auspices. More 
than 7,000 Chinese students are also studying in Japan in 1987--up from fewer 
than 3,000 in 1985. In addition, each year thousands of Chinese receive 
. technical training--ranging from several weeks to several months--through 
Japanese industry. Japan has established a management training center in 
China, and several Japanese ministries are supporting management training 
programs there. 
Chinese officials are disappointed with the small number of loint projects 
and with overall funding levels. According to US Embassy reporting, China has 
frequently told Japanese officials that Japan's programs are smaller in terms of 
money and resources than Sino-US S&T cooperation. 
Beijing is also worried about the exposure of its students in Japan to 
foreign philosophies. Chinese Embassy officials reportedly pay especially close 
attention to the activities of the China Spring group in Japan, and have warned 
students against participation in its activities. Chinese officials are reportedly 
concerned about a rise in incidents involving Chinese students who neglect 
their studies to work, or who have experienced difficulty adjusting to language 
and lifestyle differences. In Japan, the Chinese Embassy has promoted the 
establishment of student associations to help keep track of students, and 
Embassy officials have warned students that those who disobey orders will 
neither be given jobs upon their return home nor permitted to leave China 
again. Embassy personnel have also contacted the professors of students who 
are close to completing their studies to enlist their help in urging students to 
return home, reflecting  Chinese concern over students who want to stay abroad. 
Despite these concerns, cooperative research and training continued 
unabated in 1987; both coureries seem willing to isolate research and training 
activities from disputes over technology transfer and other issues. China 
usually instructs its students to  promote Sino-Japanese friendship and avoid 
involvement in political affairs.  Chinese 
officials have instructed students to raise the dormitory issue when they come 
into contact with Japanese students, suggesting China may now be more willing 
to involve students in disputes. Although we believe China is likely to allow 
cooperative research and training to proceed as usual, China may become more 
vocal about its concerns if, for example, Beijing perceives a large increase in the 
number of students who want to stay in Japan.

Medium- and Low-Technology Goods. Beijing can more easily find alternative 
suppliers for lower technology items, and Japan's share of China's overall technology 
imports has eroded over the past several years--mirroring trends in bilateral trade (see 
figure 3). Beijing had begun diversifying its suppliers of equipment and know-how as 
early as 1985 to reduce its trade imbalance and its technological dependence on the 
United States and Japan. China also strengthened demands that transfers of technology 
accompany purchases of consumer items and motor vehicles--most of which came 
from Japan. In early 1986, officials said that China intended to shift purchases of 
machine tools, consumer electronics, and automobiles from Japan, reportedly in 
response to Japanese unwillingness to transfer technology. Chinese efforts to redirect 
trade in 1987, coupled with the rising value of the yen .and a temporary ban on new 
contracts, have further reduced imports of equipment and technology from Japan.' One 
prominent Chinese economist recently predicted that  economic cooperation between 
China and Jaoan will .continue to be slow until 1990. 
Yet even for goods embodying lower levels of technology, Japanese firms remain 
significant suppliers. For example, in 1987 Japan provided almost 50 percent of all 
Chinese telecommunications imports, even though its market share has dropped from 
about 75 percent in 1985, according to Chinese statistics. 
Established Links. In our view, other factors suggest Beijing will continue to view 
Japan as an acceptable supplier of know-how and certain technology goods. The 
strong Japanese presence in China--both in terms of installed equipment, and in the 
willingness of Japanese representatives to live and work in China for extended 
periods--continues to work in Japan's favor, particularly when equipment compatibility 
is a concern. In addition to the role of Japanese firms in Chinese telecommunications, 
for example, Hitachi has basically split the Chinese mainframe computer market with 
IBM, and Japanese firms are heavily involved in 
computer and software applications in China. Japan supplied about 30 percent of all 
Chinese imports of ADP equipment during the first three quarters of 1987, about the 
same as in 1986, according to Chinese Customs statistics. 
Moreover, several Japanese firms have served China by providing technology 
illegally, and we expect China to continue to exploit this channel. Finally, despite the 
directives curtailing trade with Japan, concessionary Japanese prices and financing are 
attractive. The further decentralization of import authority being discussed as part of 
trade reform could make it even more difficult for Beijing to enforce policies toward 
Japan. A Japanese press article; for example, reports that some Chinese companies 
have sought to avoid the ban on new contracts by requesting that such contracts be 
retroactive to November because they involve electronics parts and other commodities 
that must be imported from Japan.

Implications for the United States 
We believe US firms will see little increase in technology sales as a result of the 
current Sino-Japanese frictions. Although Chinese buyers regard US technology as first 
rate, Beijing's efforts to diversify sources of supply are causing Chinese firms to look 
elsewhere. West European firms may be more likely beneficiaries of China's shift away 
from Japan. Beijing looks for the best combination of price and technology, and  
European firms' preferential financing provides difficulties for US competitors. 
China is skilled at playing US and Japanese firms against one another in 
commercial negotiations, and in its governmental relationships. China is well aware of 
US-Japan bilateral discussions over technology transfer policy, both in general and 
regarding China. China has refrained from criticizing the United States for pressuring 
Japan to increase technology controls after the Toshiba diversion. If irritation with the 
United States over export issues such as the Silkworm missile case were to continue, 
however, China could step up criticism of the United States. or cancel selected 
purchases of US technology.
