 sion, but on mutual respect and a common
 belief in the dignity of man."
 Out of a terrible war, he continued, "the
 Nation was preserved.  It ended here 100
 years  ago.   Now our task is to bind the
 wounds, and to it in unity, to build the
 America begun but never completed."
 HUMPHREY was introduced to the audience
 by Gov. Dan K. Moore following ceremonies
 in which Representative HORACE KORNEGAY,
 of Greensboro, extended greetings.
 JORDAN  SPEAKS
 Senator EVERETT JORDAN Spoke briefly, tell-
 ing the crowd the Vice President is interested
 in North Carolina's Research Triangle area
 as a suitable place for advancing the research
 programs of the Federal Government.
 William A. Creech, of Smithfield, represent-
 ing Senator SAM J. ERVIN, said the Senator
 had asked him to say he was disappointed.
 "He told me," said Creech, "he wanted me
 to extend a personal, warm welcome to one
 he holds in the highest esteem, his former
 colleague in the Senate, the Vice President.
 Samuel  T.  Morgan,  whose  grandfather
 gave the Bennett Place property to the public
 for a historic shrine, spoke on behalf of the
 family asking for "the development of a
 spirit of unity, ..without differences of birth
 or creed."
 Morgan came from the Bahamas to speak
 of the Bennett Place preservation as "the
 fulfillment of a dream of my grandfather."
 R. 0. Everett, chairman of the Bennett
 Place Centennial Commission, said the agree-
 ment at Bennett Place has come to symbolize
 a spirit of unity, without differences to make
 the occasion as meaningful for the coming
 century as the last occasion, a century ago."
 The Vice President predicted the South'will
 help lead the way in the fight to overcome
 ignorance, disease, poverty, and injustice.
 He said the South "is forging ahead with
 a pace of economic developments that is the
 wonder and the envy of every section of the
 country. '
 Noting that the Civil War was the costliest
 this Nation has ever  fought.  ? HUMPHREY
 said "too often the reenactment of historic
 battles tend to make war romantic.
 "War is not romantic.  War is ugly, cruel,
 and senseless.  We are not gathered here
 today to commemorate a war-nor are we
 gathered here to commemorate the end of a
 war.  We are here to pay -tribute to the
 valiant men of the North and the South
 who met 100 years ago at Bennett Place to
 seek peace."
 The Vice President told the crowd, "what
 a- shame it was- that all of our country at
 that trying time could not have agreed with
 Everett, the man many regard as the pri-
 mary force behind Bennett Place's emergence
 as -a site of national historic significance, sat
 in the cushioned rocker in his office and
 tossed bouquets to those who "contributed"
 -
 to the success of the centennial.
 "I'm very grateful to the city, to the cen-
 tennial committee, to the donors, to those
 who made the facilities available for the
 program and all those who've helped (the
 Bennett Place Memorial Commission)  over
 the years," he said.
 He also expressed his gratitude to Gov.
 Dan Moore for entertaining "our guest" dur-
 ing the weekend and to Duke University for
 its luncheon honoring the  Vice President
 prior to the centennial ceremony. .
 "That luncheon was a-magnificent contri-
 bution," he said.
 C. H. Pattishall, who directed arrangements
 for the ceremonies, was singled out by Ever-
 ett for his contributions.
 The 86-year-old attorney praised the "de-
 voted efforts of individuals," saying "I just
 couldn't attempt to mention them all be-
 cause I'd be afraid I'd leave someone out."
 However, he did manage to cite his wife
 and son, Robinson Everett, for, their work
 on the centennial.
 Commenting on the centennial program
 and its significance, Everett Said, "I think
 we have established the historic fact that
 the Civil War ended at Bennett Place and
 made it public knowledge.  I just hope the
 occasion justified itself in the minds of the
 public."
 He said the events should. make the his-
 toric homestead "of ever-increasing interest
 to tourists."                                 -
 Concerning the future plans for Bennett
 Place,: he mentioned the possibility of es-
 tabishing a museum at the site.
 However, he added, "I don't think I'll un-
 dertake that myself.  There's enough mo-
 mentum now that the public can take it
 over and make into a State or- national park."

 Mrs. Humphrey, Governor and Mrs. Moore,
 U.S.-Senator and Mrs. B. Everett Jordan,
 and other members of the party toured the-
 Bennett farmhouse, kitchen, and smoke-
 house.                                                                                                                                                    -      -
 "There's no ham in the smokehouse," Mrs.
 Moore joked.
 HUMPHREY stopped to read every -word of
 every marker.  And at several intervals he
 appeared to lapse into a somber pensive mood
 with very few words.
 Everett, who served as chairman of the
 Bennett Place Committee for 43. years, spoke
 briefly before the major address by HUM-
 PHREY.   His  words and- those of the Vice
 President- ran in parallel lines.
 Everett stressed that the event commemo-
 rated 100 years of peace.  He said the event
 was not intended to recall war.
 HUMPHREY, too, spoke in this mood.  "War
 is not romantic.   War is ugly, cruel, and
 senseless,!" he said.
 "We are not gathered today to commemo-
 rate a war-nor are we gathered to com-
 memorate the end of a war.  We are here
 to pay tribute- to the valiant men of the
 North and the South who met 100 years ago
 here at Bennett Place toseek peace."
 As a climax to the event-one which had
 been planned and promoted with boundless
 energy by the silver-haired Everett-came.a
 special ceremony at- a hastily called press
 conference.      -      -
 The Vice President presented Everett with
 a commission, signed by Kentucky Gov. Ed-
 ward T. Breathitt, naming Everett as a Ken-
 tucky colonel.                  -   -   -
 After the brief ceremony and words of ap-
 preciation to the press, HUMPHREY and Gov-
 ernor Moore turned to leave.        But enthu-
 siastic mobs of young and old handshakers
 surged forward and encircled the Vice Presi-
 dent to the chagrin of Secret Service agents.
 Finally, with the Ft. Bragg Post band blar-
 ing marches, the Vice President eventually
 made his - way to No. 1 limousine and was
 accompanied by Governor and - Mrs. Moore
 to the Raleigh-Durham Airport where the jet
 was waiting for the return trip to Washing-
 ton.
 "It's been quite a - weekend," - the Vice
 President  commented.   He  waved  at  the
 crowd, took one prolonged look at the small
 farmhouse  and   monuments  and took his
 seat beside the Governor.
 Soon the Bennett Place was quiet again.

 southern history.
 Yankees   cynically   mimicked   reverent

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE            May 14, 1965
 Not many people see the Bennett house
 unless they go looking for it In the country
 near Durham, and though Its significance is
 carefully explained on bronze plaques, the
 emotion of the place has generally gone cold.
 IT  WASN'T DRAMATIC
 It is not a dramatic place.  It was not a
 dramatic surrender.
 At Appomattox Courthouse there was a
 final parade, the ritual of stacking arms, Lee's
 farewell address to his troops, lots of emo-
 tion.
 At the Bennett house Johnston sat with
 Sherman in a sparsely furnished farmer's
 room, and after considerable discussion they
 aligned an agreement.  The Bennett children
 and their mother waited, wide eyed, in a log
 outbuilding, and a few Confederate and
 Union officers and orderlies mingled quietly
 outside under a big white oak tree by a well.
 No fanfare.
 The original Bennett house burned on
 October 12. 1921, and was not restored until
 1960.  Now three unpainted buildings, the
 dwelling, the kitchen, and the smokehouse,
 stand in the open at the corner of a large
 park about 5 miles west of the center of Dur-
 ham.                      The old Hillsboro Road runs around
 the corner, past a stone wall.  One small gate
 leads through the stone wall, and the build-
 ings are surrounded by a rail fence.
 A monument, two pillars supporting a stone
 with "Unity" carved on It, stands outside the
 fence.  Bronze plaques explain what hap-
 pened there, and inside the house are pic-
 tures of Sherman and Johnston, maps, an-
 tique furniture, the usual somebody-stopped.
 here trappings.
 MEMORIES REMAIN
 The clapboard               walls of  the house,  the
 sawed notches of the kitchen's logs, the ce-
 ment between the logs, the brass locks on
 the doors, the huge stone chimneys, the
 round-ended shingles, all look not exactly
 new, but at least recently weathered.
 Across a little stretch of old gravel road a
 pavilion stands under trees near the site of
 the old Bennett well.  The white oak and
 the well are gone.  People thirsting instead
 for immortality have carved on the pavilion
 timbers:  "Don    Hockaday  loves  Ramona,"
 "Otis and Sybil." A couple of rusty oil drums
 hold picknickers' leavings and trash.    On
 the bronzeplaque beneath the "Unity" stone
 someone has scratched In commas where the
 syntax of the description of the surrender is
 unclear.  The commas help.
 The place Is open only on weekends.     The
 lower window panes of the house are smeared
 from the foreheads of weekday visitors peer-
 ing into the dim rooms.

 of April 17 Johnston set out from Hillsboro on aggression, In order to defend their own
 societies from outwardly stimulated col-
 lapse; and persons from our own private
 sector-Americans who, although not
 employed by the Government, are em-
 ployed abroad in work which is closely
 associated with the conduct of interna-
 tional relations.
 Of the three groups, if forced to select
 the one most critically needing careful
 training in this discipline, but who can-
 not obtain it outside the Communist bloc,
 I would designate the foreign nationals
 as the priority group.  These are per-
 sons who will preserve their own coun-
 tries' sovereignties if they are to be pre-
 served.  Besides mounting their  own
 countries' defenses against nonmilitary
 aggression, these persons provide some
 of our own defense.  It is in our own in-
 terest to help preserve their countries'
 national sovereignties as entities which
 are not hostile to us.  We have intense
 mutual interest.
 Establishment of a freedom academy
 was urged more than a decade ago for
 priority attention.  The driving individ-
 ual behind the Idea was a Florida attor-
 ney who had interested himself in psy-
 chological warfare during World War U.
 He is Alan Grant, of Orlando, Fla. After
 organizing a study and drafting commit-
 tee, he had the concept formulated, and
 then presented it to high national secu-
 rity officials in Washington in 1954-11
 years ago.  Weeks later, he wrote as fol-
 lows to the Operations Coordinating
 Board, to inquire about progress:
 Nearly 4 weeks have passed since the OCB
 conference ? * ? and we have not yet re-
 ceived  a decision.  Nearly 5 months have
 passed since the plan was initially sent ? ? ?.
 In our planning, we are ever conscious of
 the Communist timetable.  Our estimate of
 the situation (in 1954) fills us with urgency.
 One of our group has been a student of
 partisan or guerrilla warfare for a number of
 years.  He  believes,  and we  believe,  that
 Mao's concept of revolutionary warfare based
 on the village Is the most Important military-
 political concept of our times.  We are wit-
 nessing (in 1954) an expert application of
 Mao's theories In Indochina, and they will
 be repeated In the near future in Thailand
 (it has already begun near the Malaya bor-
 der), Burma. India, and other underdevel-
 oped areas where the village is important.
 The only possible way that a Mao-type war
 can be won by the free world in a back-
 ward area is by winning the villages ideologi-
 cally and organizationally first-with supe-
 rior cadres.  Such cadres can best be de-
 veloped by a leadership group of the type we
 propose to train at the academy. Such work
 can only be carried on by convinced, dedi-
 cated men and women who have acquired
 many special skills * * ?  In a Mao-type
 war, material superiority is of secondary Im-
 portance  (as  demonstrated                                                                                                     by American
 bombs  dropping  all  too often  on  empty
 jungles with little effect other than frighten-
 ing the animals In this lates year of 1965).
 The primary ingredient is guts and opera-
 tional know-how of a new type.                                                                                                          We feel
 that many of us are refusing to face the hard
 realities of a Mao-type war, and lack the
 conviction and staying power to wage the
 battle for the villages.  Then none of us have
 had the advantage of academy training.
 This is one of the many reasons why we
 believe that our plan should be acted on at
 once.
 That was 11 years ago.  Since then,
 "Mao type wars" have commonly oc-
 curred in Africa; they are occurring in

 At Durham Station Sherman switched to

 by a detachment of cavalry.

 The two parties met near Durham, and "a

 the main room of the house.
 They talked all afternoon, while their es-
 corts passed time congenially in the shade

 but they met again the next day and drew
 up an agreement.

 food or money, and consequently had been a

 But a bargain was struck.  Johnston's sol-

 were allowed to keep their own horses and
 to use what military horses and mules re-
 mained (deserters had been stealing them).
