INDOCHINA 
Expressions of Hanoi's concern over Sino-U.S. relations reached 
a new level of authority on the occasion of the 44th anniversary 
on 1 August of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA). 
Defense Minister Giap's congratulatory message to Lin Piao 
was superficially correct, with the usual tribute to the Chinese 
revolution and the "esteemed" Chairman Mao and expressions of 
appreciation for Chinese aid. But there were elements in the 
message, as well as in Giap's speech at the Chinese embassy 
reception, which seemed clearly to reflect North Vietnamese 
annoyance with China. 
Hanoi also chose the 1 August anniversary to publish a lengthy 
NHAN DAN Commentator article on the history of "aggressive U.S. 
impericalism"; the article made Hanoi's first--albeit oblique--
reference to steps to improve Sino-U.S. relations when it 
observed that "recently, the U.S. ruling circles have occasionally 
spoken of reassessing the China danger." And it pointedly went 
on to say that "the U.S. imperialists, however, can in no way 
conceal their sinister designs and cruel schemes against the 
Chinese revolution from the clearsighted vision of progressive 
mankind." 
Peking for the most part has ignored the polemical Hanoi comment, 
but it has sought to reassure the Vietnamese, as well as its Laotian 
and Cambodian allies, that support for them would not be diminished 
by the recent PRC moves to improve relations with the United States. 
Support for the PRG's 1 July peace proposal is reiterated on an 
authoritative level in a 3 August PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator article, 
pegged to a message from Sihanouk to the Khmer people in which he 
said Chou En-lai had reassured him that the Nixon visit would not 
change PRC support for Indochina. 
Moscow continues to complain that the United States is delaying a 
reply to the PRG's seven-point proposal, with many commentators 
saying President Nixon's planned trip to Peking aids U.S. 
procrastination. They say the trip is aimed at diverting 
attention from the war and at making it possible for the United 
States to avoid a reply to the PRG proposal. Moscow's support 
for the PRG proposal is expressed authoritatively in the 
2 August communique on the meeting in the Crimea of the leaders 
of "fraternal countries." 
NHAN DAN ATTACKS ON U,S., GIAP REMARKS SHOW PIQUE AT PRC

PRG peace initiative, the media dispensed with polemical atta,k. 
on the United States for almost a week. But on the occasion 
of the 44th anniversary of Peking's PLA, on 1 August, Hanoi 
again voiced its misgivings about Peking's flirtation with the 
country engaged in "imperialist aggression" in Indochina. 
Defense Minister Giap's annual congratulatory message to his 
counterpart Lin Piao as well as his speech at an anniversary 
reception conveyed some of the overtones of the earlier 
propaganda, though in less direct fashion. At sharp variance 
with the substance of Giap's messages on this occasion for the 
past six years, almost half .)f the message this time was devoted 
to a discussion of U.S. "aggression" in Indochina in terms 
similar to the recent flurry of Hanoi comment assailing the 
Nixon Doctrine. Thus, Giap said that the United States, along 
with its "criminal war and preparations for new military 
adventures," is "resorting to all perfidious moves in the 
hope of getting out of its stalemate and improving its difficult 
situation. The VIctnamese people and armed forces always 
maintain a resolute stand and keep a wary eye on all the 
schemes and maneuvers of the enemy . . . ." 
Superficially, the message was correct and some of the passages 
were verbatim repeats of the language of earlier years: There 
was the usual praise for the Chinese revolution and the 
"esteemed" Chairman Mao, hope for continuing fraternal fr5.entiship 
and militant solidarity between the two peoples, End expressions 
of gratitude for the great Chinese support and assistance to 
the Vietnamese. But in another break with the language of the 
six previous messages, Giap for the first time did not 
characterize Chinese assistance as being in the spirit of 
"proletarian internationalism." He was also more sparing ln 
his use of adjectives this year, expressing "deep gratitude for 
the great, precious support and assistance." Last year he had 
cited the "wholehearted and firm support and great and effective 
assistance full of proletarian internationalism." 
A reference to proletarian internationalism did appear in this 
year's message in another, seemingly pointed context. While 
the message concluded exactly as last year's did, "May the 
fraternal friendship and militant solidarity between the peoples 
and armies last forever r, it included a reminder in another 
passage that the Vietnamese "have always done their best to 
consolidate and strengthen [Chinese-Vietnamese] friendship on 
the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism."

At the same time, the message did not repeat last year's 
assertion that the Vietnamese consider Chinese successes "strong 
stimulus for their own revolutionary cause." 
It also seems significant that Giap this year paid tribute to the 
PRC's contribution to the worldwide struggle only in a historical 
context. Thus, after describing the PLA's feats on the way to 
the victorious Chinese revolution, he said that this victory 
"ushered in the era of socialism in fraternal China while dealing 
a very heavy blow at U.S.-led imperialism, greatly contributin& 
to the world eo le's stru le for ?eace national inde endence, 
democracy, and socialism." The underlined phrase appeared in 
last year's message in a current rather than a historical context. 
The 1970 message read: 
Armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Tse-tung thought, 
with its andaunted fighting spirit and splendid 
tradition of struggle, with the rapid progress of 
modern military science and technology, the PLA is 
now assuming the glorious task of defending the 
socialist construction of the Chinese people, 
greatly contributing to the cause of peace, 
national independence, democrac and socialism 
in the whole world. 
This year's message used identical language to characterize the 
PLA but described its "glorious task" only as "preserving the 
gains of the Chinese people's revolution while taking an active 
part in the building of socialism with greater and greater 
success." 
GIAP SPEECH NCNA carried the text of Giap's congratulatory 
message, just as it had carried the text of the 
21 Julz DRV Foreign Ministry statement marking the anniversary of 
the 1954 agreements, with its charge that the United States has 
"resorted to insidious tricks to sow division among the socialist 
countries In an attempt to pressure the Vietnamese people into 
accepting their conditions." However, Peking media have 
ignored the polemical Hanoi oress comment, and in reporting Giap's 
speech at the Chinese embassy reception on PLA day NCNA omitted 
some of his remarks included in the VNA version. (A full text 
of Giap's speech has not been carried by VNA or Hanoi radio.)

As reported by VNA, Giap in his speech cited recent communist 
"victories of strategic significance" in Indochina as evidence 
of small countries' ability to defeat even U.S. " imperialist 
aggression," scored Vietnamization and the Nixon Doctrine, and 
said that the U.S. "imperialists" are "resorting to all cruel 
and cunning schemes, military as well as political, in an 
attempt to save themselves from their predicament." But NCNA's 
renort deleted the reference to "cruel and cunning schemes." 
NCNA duly reported Giap's reference to the "valuable support 
and assistance" from China, but it ignored a later passage in 
which he stressed Vietnamese self-reliance. As reported by VNA, 
he said. "Relying mainly on our own efforts and enjoying the 
sympathy, great support and assistance of the socialist countries 
and the world's peoples, we Vietnamese people more than ever 
before firmly believe in our invincible strength, are resolved 
to defeat completely the U.S. aggressors . . . ." 
*IAN DAN The lengthy MAN DAN Commentator article of 1 August, 
COMMENTATOR broadcast in installments by Hanoi radio on the 1st 
and 2d, uses the device of tracing the history of 
U.S. "imperialism" since the Spanish-American War to direct new 
jibes at Peking for its courting of the Nixon Administration. It 
is after a reference to the Taiwan policy of the "Eisenhower-Nixon 
clique" and the persistent policy of U.S. air intrusions and 
"provoca,ions" against China that Commentator refers obliquely to 
moves to improve Sino-U.S. relations: "Recently, the U.S. ruling 
circles have occasionally spoken of reassessing the China danger. 
However, the U.S. imperialists can in no way conceal their sinister 
designs and cruel schemPs against the Chinese revolution from the 
clearsighted vision of progressive mankind." 
Echoing a major theme of the polemical Hanoi propaganda beginning 
with the 19 July NHAN DAN editorial, Commentator then declares that 
a major U.S. aim is to sow disunity among the socialist countries. 
While in the earlier comment this aim was put in terms of the Nixon 
Doctrine, Commentator says that "to divide and rule has been the 
imperialists' traditional stratagem aimed at repressing and 
annihilating the revolutionary forces." And he adds bluntly: 
In recent years the United States has at certain times 
created the impression that there were new changes in 
its relations with one country or another . . . . But 
the advanced forces leading the various revolutionary 
movements in the world have come to realize more and 
more clearly that the United States' old rigidity or new 
flexibility are dictated by one motive and one basic 
objective determined by the unchanged, aggressive nature 
of U.S. imperialism.

PEKING SEEKS TO ALLAY ANXIETIES OF INDOCHINESE ALLIES 
Peking has sought to allay Vietnamese communist uneasiness at 
U.S.-PRC moves to improve relations by sustaining its high-
level support for the 1 July PRG seven-point peace initiative 
and the Indochinese "struggle" against the United States. Most 
notable was a 3 August PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator article 
chastising the United States for its failure to respond to 
the PRG seven-point proposal and seeking to take the wind out 
of speculation on the convening of a new Geneva conference on 
Indochina. 
Although keyed to Sihanouk's 24th message to the Khmer nation, 
dated 30 July--released by Pyongyang's KCNA on 31 July and 
carried in virtually identical form by NCNA on 2 August--the 
PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator article ignored the fact that 
Sihanouk's message was devoted to President Nixon's projected 
visit to Peking.* However, by quoting selectively from 
Sihanouk's message, Commentator stressed his point that "the 
problem of Indochina can be settled only by the Indochinese 
peoples themselves" on the basis of a total and unconditilnal 
withdrawal of all non-Indochinese forces, leaving the 
Indochinese "to solve themselves the problems without outside 
interference." Sihanouk had prefaced this declaration with 
the contention that "the essential subjects of discussions" 
between Nixon and Chou En-lai "will probably be confined to 
problems directly connected with the United States and the 
PRC, for example that of Taiwar, an integral part of China." 
In fact, the essence of Sihanouk's message, and the point 
which Peking sought to convey to its Indochinese compatriots, 
was capsuled in his claim that Chou had "assured" him that 
the Nixon visit "would in no way bring a change to the 
attitude of the PRC" with respect to its support for the 
RGNUC, the Vietnamese communists, and the Laotian Patriotic

Offering additional assurance, PEOPLE'S DAILY addressed itself 
to an alleged rumor concerning the convening of a new Geneva 
conference to seek an Indochina-wide settlement, declaring that 
"any plot or intrigue of U.S. imperialism that runs counter to 
the will and interests of the Indochinese peoples will never 
succeed." Citing Sihanouk's revelation of such a plot, 
* NCNA's transmission of the Sihanouk message was Peking

Commentator charged that the United States, while refusing 
"to respond" to the PRG seven-point proposal, has "instigated 
its Phnom Penh lackeys to spread the word that a new Geneva 
conference would be convened." Claiming that the 1954 Geneva 
agreements "have long been thoroughly sabotaged by U.S. 
imperialism," Commentator maintained that in the face of 
defeat on the Indochina battlefield the United States "is 
vainly trying to turn the tide and seek a way out by calling 
a new Geneva conference." "This can never be done," PEOPLE'S 
DAILY sed, quoting Sihanouk's assertion that "we three 
Indochinese peoples are not in need of a new Geneva conference 
at all." 
Underlining its across-the-board support for the three 
Indochinese peoples, Commentator stated that "the correct way" 
to solve "the Indochina question" is compliance with the joint 
declaration of the summit conference of the Indochinese 
peoples, Sihanouk's five-point statement, the PRG's seven-
point proposal, the five-noint political solution of the Lao 
Patriotic Front, and the new Lao initiative for a nationwide 
cease-fire. Peking echoed its past demand--and "the common 
demand of the people of the three Indochinese countries"--
that the United States withdraw "from the whole of Indochina 
totally, unconditionally, and immediately." Sihanouk in his 
message had called for "the unconditional, total, and rapid 
withdrawal" of aggressive forces, but added "or at least the 
precise fixation of the date-limit for this withdrawal." 
Since Peking in this Commentator article was addressing 
itself to the wider Indochina problem--and it was in this 
broader context that the denunciation of the call for a 
new Geneva conference was made--the demand for a total, 
unconditional, and immediate U.S. withdrawal from all of 
Indochina cannot be viewed as a hardening of Peking's line on 
the more limited Vietnam issue as enunciated in the 4 July 
and 20 July PEOPLE'S DAILY editorials. Those editorials, 
endorsing the 1 July PRG seven-point proposal specifically 
focused on point one which calls on the United States to 
establish a terminal date in 1971 for troop withdrawal. 
Commentator again declared Peking's support of the PRG's 
seven-point proposal. 
That 1 July PRG initiative has also received sustained 
high-level endorsement from other Chinese quarters. In 
his speech at the 31 July reception marking the 44th

anniversary of the PLA, Chief of Staff Huang Yung-sheng 
stated Chinese "firm support" for, among other things, the 
PRG's seven-point proposal.* Reporting a speech at a Hanoi 
meeting marking the same occasion, NCNA on 1 August cited 
the contention of the military attache of the PRC Embassy in 
Hanoi that the seven-point proposal "has opened a correct way 
for peaceful settlement of the Vietnam question." "But the 
Nixon Administration quibbled about this proposal," the 
attache added, while pushing Vietnamization and intensifying 
military operations. Similarly, a joint Algerian-PRC 
communique of 2 August recorded both sides' expression of 
"firm support" for the Indochinese peoples and their "full 
agreement" with the seven-point proposal, citing the essence 
of the first two points. Although the PEOPLE'S DAILY/ 
LIBERATION ARMY DAILY/RED FLAG joint editorial marking the 
PLA's 44th anniversary did not specifically mention the PRG's 
initiative, it did express "resolute support" for the 
Indochinese peoples and contend that U.S. forces and 
"lackey troops" must "unconditionally withdraw from 
Vietnam and the whole of Indochina, lock, stock, and barrel." 
BACKGROUND ON ISSUE Peking customarily has carried the text 
OF GENEVA CONFERENCE of past Sihanouk statement, some of 
which have also included rejections 
of the notion of an international conference on Indochina, but 
it is not known to have previously commenteci on one of his 
messages to the Khmer people." On its own authority, Peking 
has occasionally reacted negatively to various calls for an 
international conference on Indochina, characterizing such 
suggestions as a "fraud" or "trick" to get the Indochinese 
people to lay down their arm:. In its last previous reference 
to the issue Peking reacted in this vein to President Nixon's 
call for an Indochina conference included as point two in his 
five-point proposal of 7 October 1970. An NCNA commentary on 
11 October and a PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator article on the 
13th called the conference proposal a trick and a plot to 
"strangle" the Indochinese people's strAggle. A flurry of 
negative statements on the President's proposal by Sihanouk 
* Li Hsien-nien is the only other elite-level PRC spokesman

and his government included a 10 October statement which raised 
the question of Chinese participation in a conference. As in 
his current statement, Sihanouk said that such a conference 
would not succeed without Chinese participation and that the 
Chinese would not attend a conference also attended by the 
Lon No]. government. 
Peking as well as Sihanouk reacted negatively to suggestions 
for an interna-,ional conference in the wake of the March 1970 
Cambodian coup--by the French cabinet on 1 April, and later 
by the three-nation mission of the Djakarta conference--Japan, 
Indonesia, and Malaysia. For example, Li Hsien-nien at a 
6 June 1970 reception on the PRG anniversary dismissed 
efforts of the three-nation mission by saying that the United 
States was stepping up "political deception" by "plotting 
international conferences under 7arious names." 
USSR SAYS SINO-U.S? DEVELOPMENTS HELP U.S. AVOID REPLY TO PRG 
Moscow's continued support for the PRG's peace plan is currently 
highlighted by the 2 August communique on the meeting held by 
the leaders of "fraternal countries"--Moscow's East European 
allies, except Romania, plus Mongolia. The communique promises 
continued "all-round support" of the Indochinese peoples and 
says that the PRG's seven points "constitute a just foundation 
for restoring peace and security in Southeast Asia." 
Routine comment continues to complain that the United States 
is procrastinating on a reply to the PRG's proposal, many 
commentators referring to President Nixon's plarni-d trip to 
Peking in this context. Commentators continue to question 
how it can be a "peace trip," as described by the President, 
since it comes at a time when aggression is continuing in 
Indochina. Commentators recall that the President himself 
said the trip was not connected to an end to the Indochina 
war, and they charge that the trip is aimed at diverting 
attention from the war and setting the stage for the 1972 
election campaign. They say that the propaganda campaign 
raised in the United States over the trip is making it 
unnecessary for the President to reply to the PRG proposal,

and several commentators cite a New York TIMES article asserting 
that the President's new policy toward China has sent the Paris 
talks back toward a stalemate.* 
Moscow criticizes Peking's Indochina policies in some Radio 
Peace and Progress broadcasts in Mandarin. A 1 August 
commentary again cites Hanoi's charge that President Nixon's 
policy is aimed at dividing the socialist countrils and adds 
that Washington is making use of Peking's long-standing 
splittist policies and refusal to join in united action to 
help the Indochinese people. A 3 August commentary, which 
also charges that the United States is exploiting Peking's 
anti-Soviet, splitting policies to escalate the war, says 
that such escalation has been stepped up in the wake of 
Kissinger's visit to Peking and the invitation to President 
Nixon. 
1* Moscow does not mention that the article, by Tad Szulc, 
noted that some observers had concluded that Peking would be 
unable to settle the Vietnam war except on Hanoi's terms in 
view of Hanoi's expressed opposition to may "big power" 
solution to the conflict.

DRV, PRG PRESS FOR "POSITIVE" UIS, RESPONSE TO PEACE PLAN 
Vietnamese communist propaganda on the 1 July PRG proposal is 
confined largely to continued pickups of world reaction hailing 
it as a reasonable and correct basis for achieving peace in 
Vietnaw. The only available comment since the 25 July NHAN DAN 
Commentator article comes in a Liberation Radio broadcast of 
31 July which scores the lack of U.S. response to the proposal 
and U.S. efforts to clarify its various points. The radio 
notes that Ambassador Bruce at the 22 July Paris session "again 
asked for more clarification" of the "perfectly clear" point one 
on troop withdrawal and prisoner release. It adds darisively 
that h-uce "pretends to be deaf" and tries to avoid a serious 
discussion by asking for more clarification. 
The Vietnamese communist delegates at the 29 July Paris 
session again criticized the United States for its "intensifica-
tion of aggression" and "negative" attitude toward the PRG 
proposal. They again urged a "serious" response--particularly 
to the two basic points on a U.S. troop withdrawal deadline and 
an end to U.S. backing of the Thieu administration. 
Both the LPA and VNA accounts reported that PRG Foreign Minister 
Mme. Binh again assailed the United States for attempting to 
evade negotiations by "rehashing its worn-out proposal for a 
'cease-fire in place" which, she said, is aimed at legalizing 
both U.S. occupation of South Vietnam and the "puppet 
administration." (The accounts do not reflect the fact that 
Mme. Binh's brief remarks on the U.S. call for a cease-fire were 
prompted by Ambassador Bruce's statement at the 22 July session. 
The Vietnamese communist post-session press briefings?which, as 
usual, go unreportld in the media--indicate that both Mae. Binh 
and DRV delegate Xuan Thuy in the rebuttal period recalled 
that the cease-fire proposal had been previously rejected.) 
The VNA account reports Xuan Thuy's charge that the 
Administration's "continued refusal to set" a withdrawal date 
in 1971 after the PRG's offer on prisoner release proves that 
it has been using the prisoners to hide its real intention 
of prolonging the war and continuing to impose the Thieu 
regime on the South Vietnamese people. VNA does not report 
that Thuy cited recent remarks by President Nixon and Secretary 
of Defense Laird on continuing Vietnamization and aid as 
evidence of U.S. intent to continue the war. Xuan Thuy at 
the 22 July session and the Commentator article of the 25th 
had deplored the Administration's "hypocrisy" on the POW issue.

Liberation Radio has continued to broadcast purported statements 
by U.S. prisoners commenting on the, PRGIo proposal, and Hanoi 
Joined in with a 2 August English-language broadcast of a 
message from two U.S. nrisoners in the North. Addressed to 
Congress "via Representative McCloskey and Senator McGovern," 
the message briefly notes point one of the PRG proposal and 
urges that a date for troop withdrawal "be set by legislativa 
act" to end the war so that Vietnam "will then be free to 
settle its own internal affairs." 
BRUCE STATEMENT Regarding Ambassador Bruce's statement at 
the session on the 29ch, VNA charges that 
he "kept evading a response to the seven-point peace plan set 
forth" by Mine. Binh a month ago and that he "slandered the DRV 
in a bid to justify the U.S. continued acts against the DRV* and 
intensified acts of aggression against South Vietnam, Laos and 
Cambodia." Thus VNA obscures his specific charge of heightened 
DRY military activity in the demilitarized zone (DMZ), particularly 
the building of a road through the western part of the DMZ joining 
roads in North Vietnam with those in the South. VNA says 
Ministers Thuy and Binh "laid bare the obstinate, negative, and 
slanderous allegations of the United States." It dismisses 
Ambassador Lam's prepared statement in one sentence: "For his 
part, the representative of the Saigon puppet administration 
only rehashed Nguyen Van Thieu's bellicose claims." 
Vietnamesc communist media have not mentioned that the 29 July 
session marked Ambassador Bruce's last appearance as head of 
the U.S. delegation and that he will be succeeded by Ambassador 
Porter on a date yet to be announced. (The communist spokesmen 
at the post-session briefing, responding to questions about 
Bruce's resignation, took tlie tack that the important thing is 
the President's policy.) 
* North Vietnam to date has not protested the acknowledged U.S. 
activity against the North on 29 and 30 July, although Hanoi 
did claim that an unmanned U.S. reconnaissance plane was downed 
on 31 July over Quang Binh Province, bringing the DRV's tally 
of downed U.S. aircraft to 3,396.

LE DUC THO VISITS MOSCOW, PEKING EN ROUTE TO HANOI FROM PARIS 
Le Due Tholo departure from Paris on 28 July--after a five-week 
stay dating from 21 June--was reported promptly by Hanoi the 
following day. WIA and Hanoi radio reported his arrival back 
in Hanoi on 2 August, noting that he wau accompanied by Nguyen 
Minh Vy, deputy head of the DRV delegation to the Paris talks.* 
Also on the 2d, Hanoi mentioned hie stopovers in both Moscow 
and Peking. 
STOPOVER In Moscow from 28 to 30 July, Le Due Tho met with 
IN MOSCOW Politburo member Klrilenko for "warm and cordial" 
talks. According to both Moscow and Hanoi media, 
they discussed the further strengthening of friendship and 
cooperation between the two countries and the "development of 
the situation" in Indochina. The Soviet side expressed support 
for the PRG's seven-point peace proposal and promised to 
continue to do "everything necessary" to help the Vietnamosa 
people's cause. Le Due Tho emphasized Vietnamese determination 
to fight until victory and expressed gratitude for tha USSR's 
"constant assistance and support." 
TASS had reported on 22 June that Le Due Tho met with both 
Kirilenko and Katushev while in Moscow en route to Paris after 
attending the East German party congress, but did not indicate 
the substance of their talks. Hanoi media never mentioned Tho's 
brief stopover in Moscow in June; VNA merely noted on 24 June 
that Le Due Tho had left for Paris that day after attending 
the East German congress, obscuring the fact that his departure 
was from Moscow. 
Le Due Tho had also stopped in Moscow on his last previous 
trip to Paris, for the French Communist Party congress in 
January 1970, but .there were no reports that he met any Soviet 
leaders. On his isTay home in April that year he attended the 
Lenin centenary celebrations in Moscow. he mel; with Kosygin

by NCNA on 10 June to have proceeded "in a mont cordial and

22 June proposal which called for a cease-fire throughout Laos 
"including" a cessation of U.S. bombing, to be followed by talks 
between the "parties concerned" in Laos. The DRV statement 
echoes the earlier NHAN DAN editorial on the anniversary, scoring 
the United States and its Vientiane "stooges" for having 
"rejected" the proposal and for mustering Vientiane "rightist," 
Vang Pao, and Thai troops to launch a big operation in the

HANOI EVALUATES MILITARY DEVELOPMENTS IN FIRST HALF OF 1971 
A flurry of recent Hanoi commentaries, using the device of a 
review of the Indochina fighting during the first nix months 
of the year, reiteratesconclusions stated earlier on the basis 
of "strategic victories" achieved during Operation Lam Son 719. 
It is standard DRV practice to review military accomplishments 
biannually, but there seems this time to be an unusual 
concentration of authoritative propaganda similar to that in 
mid-1970 in the wake of the incursion into Cambodia. The 
current propaganda includes a 14 July QUAD DOI NHAN DAN 
editorial, an article by "Chien Thang" (The Victor) published 
in the 2 August issues of both NHAN DAN and QUAN DOI NHAN DAN, 
and an article by "Truc Chien" (Combat Alert) published in 
installments in QUAN DOI NHAN DAN at the end of July. In 
addition, there is an unusual, if not unique, Hanoi radio 
series of panel discussions on the war featuring editors from 
the radio and QUAN DOI NHAN DAN, broadcast in the domestic 
service from 26 July through 3 August. 
As earlier propaganda had done, the current comment indicates 
that the communists regard 1971 and 1972 as crucial years in 
defeating Vietnamization and turning the tide in their favor. 
Some of the comment again presses the notion that main force 
action is necessary to radically change the development of the 
war, thus raising the possibility that communist offensive 
action will be stepped up. 
1971-72 TEST OF Alleged communist military achievements in 
VIETNAMIZATION the first half of the year are hailed in 
the Hanoi commentaries as the greatest 
victories since the Tet offensive of early 1968. Just as the 
Tet offensive has been portrayed as the blow which persuaded 
the United States to change to a "defensive strategy" and stop 
the bombing of the North, so military achievements this year 
are said to be significant steps in forcing President Nixon to 
abandon Vietnamization and the "prolongation" of the war. 
The 14 July QUAN DOI NHAN DAN editorial, for example, echoing 
comment during the campaign against Operation Lam Son 719,* 
* A 22 March QUAN DOT NHAN DAN article attributed to the military 
commentator Chien Binh (Combatant) claimed that the allied "defeat" 
in Laos was a blow at the Nixon Administration's will and, warning 
of "catastrophes" in the future, said that the President "cannot 
refuse to change his strategy." (See the 31 March TRENDS, page 4.)

claimed that "strategically significant victories" in the past 
six months "constitute a strong blow at the Nixon clique's 
aggressive will . . . , forcing it to re-examine its Vietnamization 
policy." 
Underlining the importance of 1971 and 1972, Hanoi propagandiss 
maintain that the allies were forced to launch major operatiolP; 
!AI Laos and Cambodia in hopes of stabilizing the situation in 
South Vietnam prior to the GVN elections this year and the U.S. 
presidential election next year. A participant in the series of 
radio panel discussions typically remarked that 1971 was the 
"key year" for U.S. strategic policies. He went on to note 
the timing of the elections in South Vietnam and the United 
States, commenting that President Nixon's plans to stabilize 
the situation have failed and that the Americans have therefore 
encountered "great political difficulties" as well as difficulties 
on the battlefield. 
Propaganda during Lam Son 719 in February and March this year also 
repeatedly made the point that the ARVN offensives in Laos and 
Cambodia were part of an allied effort to prevent major communist 
attacks during the 1971-72 election years. In addition, an 
article by Ha Van in the March-April issue of the Hanoi journal 
TUYEN HUAN (Propaganda and Training) speculated that the prospects 
for the coming 1971-72 dry season were "increasingly desperate" 
for the allies in view of the timing of the U.S. presidential 
election campaign and the disadvantageous change in the balance 
of forces which will result from a continuing withdrawal of 
U.S. troops. 
THE ROLE OF Some of the current comment again stresses the 
MAIN FORCES importance of main force unit action. The Chien 
Thang article claimed that an "outstanding 
feature" of the situation in the last six months was the fact 
that "liberation main force units . . . annihilated the enemy's 
big army corps while they were being deployed in large-scale 
combat formations." He went on to note the impact of offensives 
by main force units and their unique role in fighting "big 
battles of annihilation" as well as in striking at the enemy's 
strongest forces and "thereby definitely weakening him." The 
offensive blows of main forces, according to Chien Thang, 
"contribute toward upsetting and confusing enemy strategies, 
rapidly changing the balance of forces and the situation on the 
battlefield, and creating a radical development in the war."

In a similar vein, a panelist in the radio discussion on the 
27th cryptically hailed the "victories" in Laos as "opening a 
new era for fighting annihilating battles." On the 29th a 
panelist emphasized that the "revolutionary forces" were "in 
their best shape ever" and noted pointedly that, having defeated 
an anew, if your forces remain in good shape you can "continue 
to step up the offensive tempo and attack the enemy again when 
the latter is panic-stricken and on the verge of collapse." 
Both the 14 July WAN DOI NHAN DAN editorial and a panelist in 
the final discussion program maintained that "victories" this 
year have "opened prospects" for defeating the allies "militarily." 
The claim that mi1itary victory can be achieved, implicitly 
raising the possibility of stepped-up fighting to obtain that 
end, had not often appeared in Hanoi propaganda in recent years 
prior to Lam Son 719. A 2 April article by Chien Binh departed 
from the usual Hanoi pattern of vaguely stating that victory was 
certain, arguing instead that the communists were fully able to 
defeat the allies "militarily."

withdrawal from Taiwan and other areas in Asia. In the wake of the 
PLA anniversary comment, containing Peking's most comprehensive 
statement of foreign policy since the announcement on President 
Nixon's visit, Peking on 4 August reacted sharply to Secretary 
Rogers' statement on the China representation question in the United 
Nations by accusing the United States of playing a "clumsy 'two 
Chinas' trick." 
Peking marked the PLA anniversary with the usual reception, 
held on 31 July and addyeased by Chief of Staff Huang Yung-sheng, 
and a 1 August joint editorial in PEOPLE'S DAILY, RED FLAG, and 
LIBERATION ARMY DAILY. Peking's dual approach to revolution and 
diplomacy was illustrated by the honored status of a leader of the 
Burmese communist insurgents at the reception held on the same day 
NCNA announced the invitation to Ne Win. In addition to the Burmese 
communist, Ba Thein Tin, the guests of honor included the premier of 
Sihanouk's government, Penn Nouth; Le Duc Tho, stopping over in 
Peking en route home from the Paris talks; and diplomatic representatives 
from Peking's allies plus the Palestine Liberation Organization 
representative. As is customary for gatherings of this sort, NCNA 
noted the presence of the head of the Soviet delegation to the border 
talks. 
DIPLOMATIC LINE As in other pronouncements during the period of 
Peking's diplomatic drive beginning last fall, 
comment on the PLA anniversary has celebrated the PRC's broadening 
international relations. The joint editorial confers the highest 
sanction on this development by describing the "great victories" 
achieved by "Mao's revolutionary diplomatic line," a formulation 
contrived to clothe Peking's pronounced shift toward diplomatic 
approaches with Maoist revolutionary rhetoric. The editorial refers 
to closer ties with unnamed communist countries and to growing 
relations with third-world countries. It also takes note of the 
intensive practice of peopll's diplomacy, singling out contacts with

the American people for special mention. According to the 
editorial, the continuing expansion of the PRC's diplomatic 
relations demonstrates that the U.S. policy of "blockading and 
isolating China has failed completely." 
There was no mention in anniversary comment of President Nixon's 
forthcoming visit, a subject on which Peking has been silent since 
it carried the original announcement.* But the editorial's 
exposition of Peking's "revolutionary diplomatic line," taken 
together with its portrayal of the United States "now declining 
just as the star of the British Empire did," provides a 
rationale for the demarche. Though there is no direct reference 
to negotiations in expounding the diplomatic line, the editorial 
contains an allusion to basic Maoist scripture on the subject in its 
call in this context for study of "the historical experience of 
our party in carrying out tit-for-tat struggles" against the enemy. 
A recent source for such a study, the 1 July joint editorial article 
on the CCP's 50th anniversary, quoted Mao as having explained that 
"sometimes not going to negotiations was tit for tat, and sometimes 
going to negotiations was also tit for tat." This passage, from 
Mao's 1945 report "On the Chungking Negotiations," was cited in the 
1 July article's discussion of Mao's trip to Chungking for negotiations 
with Chiang Kai-shek.** The 1 August editorial, while treading 
gingerly along the delicate subject of President Nixon's visit, has thus 
subtly made use of a scriptural fragment and a significant formulation 
in a highly charged context to signal a policy line implying a major 
role for negotiations. 
* Apart from the announcement, the only mention of the invitation 
to the President in PRC media was contained in Sihanouk's 24th 
message to the Khmer people, transmitted by NCNA on 2 August. A 
3 August PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator article pegged to Sihanouk's 
message carefully avoided any mention of the invitation. See the 
Indochina section of this TRENDS. 
** Mao'r 1945 report was invoked to justify negotiating with the 
enemy in comment broadcast by the Kiangsu provincial radio shortly before 
the opening o: the Sino-Soviet border talks in October 1969. This 
line was not picked up in the central media and was not heard in other 
provinical media.

TAIWAN While preparing the ground for negotiations, Peking 
has also staked out a tough position on the Taiwan 
question. Expressing concern over efforts within the international 
community to seek an accommodation on this. question falling 
short of the PRC's demand., the editorial reiterates opposition to 
versions of a two-Chinas solution, the Taiwan independence movement, 
and the proposition that sovereignty over Taiwan remains unsettled. 
Both the editorial and Huang Yung-sheng's speech renew the call for 
withdrawal of U.S. military forces and installations from Taiwan 
and the Straits, one of Peking's long-standing conditions (along 
with an agreement on peaceful coexistence) for Sino-U.S.? detente. 
The editorial and the speech are particularly notable for their 
pitch to the people on Taiwan to hitch their wagon to the PBC as the 
vehicle and focus of Chinese patriotism rather than to calculate on the 
advantages of independence of mainland authority. As the editorial 
puts it, "We are confident that our patriotic compatriots in Taiwan 
will not allow any foreign forces of aggression to sever Taiwan from 
the rest of the territory of China." 
Last year on this occasion Peking limited itself to pro forma 
expressions of resolve to "liberate" Taiwan and a generalized demand 
for "U.S. imperialism" to "get out" of Taiwan. Huang last year 
mentioned the army as well as the people as being determined to 
liberate Taiwan; th4s year, perhaps less provocatively, he did not 
mention the army, declaring simply, "We are determined to liberate 
Taiwan." Both the editorial and Huang's speech this year contain 
the assertion that this matter "is China's internal affair and 
brooks no foreign interference," a standard line consistent with 
Peking's position since the 1950's that the U.S. presence is a subject 
for negotiations but that control over Taiwan is an internal 
question. 
On 4 August Peking responded to Secretary Rogers' statement two 
days earlier that the United States will support the seating of 
the PRC in the United Nations while opposing expulsion of the ROC. 
A report carried by NCNA and the Peking radio treated the U.S. move 
as an effort to implement a two-China's poliuy that "is absolutely 
illegal and futile." The report expressed concern over indications 
that the United States will seek to have the question of the ROC's 
explusion handled as an important question requiring a two-thirds 
majority. It did not mention the question of the Security Council 
seat, though it twice referred to China's "seats" in the United Nations.

Peking's prompt reaction to the Rogers statement suggests its 
concern to koep up pressures on UN members to meet its demands 
and to avert a two-Chinas arrangement. As in Peking's report 
on the China representation vote last fall, the 4 August report 
noted that the pro-PRC resolution won a majority vote "amid 
thunderous applause," adding that this year's resolution has won 
warm approval and support from more countries." The report 
concluded with an expression of hope that "the justice-upholding 
countries" will not permit obstruction of the PRC's entry. The 
report failed, however, to specify what position the PRQ would 
take should it be invited to join without the ROC 's expulsion. 
The report pointedly took note of the Secretary's statement that 
the decision taken "is fully in accord with President Nixon's 
desire to normalize relations" with the PRC. According to Peking, 
this "fully lays bare the counterrevolutionary double-dealing tricks 
of U.S. imperialism which says one thing and does another." The 
report did not, however, go on to draw implications from the decision 
for Sino-U.S. relations. Moreover, the report's vague attribution 
of plots and tricks to "U.S. imperialism" contrasts with Peking's 
reaction to an earlier move which it interpreted as aimed at a two-
Chinas approach--State repartment spokesman Bray's 28 April remarks 
terming sovereignty over Taiwan an unsettled question. A 4 March 
NCNA report on Bray's remarks repeatedly mentioned the Nixon 
Administration by name in daning its gestures to improve relations 
and warning the Administration not to "cling to its hostility" toward 
the Chinese. 
PROLETARIAN The PLA anniversary editorial sought to balance 
INTERNATIONALISM its exposition of Peking's diplomatic line with 
assurances that the Chinese remain faithful to 
their revolutionary commitments. Peking's foreign policy as outlined 
in the editorial follows standard lines: relations with communist 
countries on the baEis of proletarian internationalibm; support for 
revolutionary struggles; and peaceful coexistence with countries having 
different social systems. A week earlier, speaking at a banquet for a 
visiting Sierra Leone delegation, Li Hsien-nien prefaced a statement of 
support for the anti-U.S. forces in Indochina by hailing proletarian 
internationalism as "the highest principle guiding China's foreign 
policy." 
A passage in the editorial pledging support for revolutionary and anti-
U.S. forces opens with the avowal that "whoever opposes imperialism 
or makes revolution has our support." Complementing its demand for 
U.S. withdrawal from Taiwan, the e0itorial also includes demands for

withdrawal of American forces from Indochina, South Korea, and 
Japan. In Huang's speech the list was extended to include the 
Philippines and Thailand. 
SOVIET UNION The editorial gets in the usual thrust at the 
superpowers, naming the United States and the Soviet 
Union, and it updates a notion from the early 1960's in charging 
that the two superpowers ceek to extend their power into "the vast 
intermediate zone." The editorial gives short shrift to "social 
imperial:am," omitting to mention the Soviets by name in this 
context while denouncing the doctrines of limited sovereignty and 
the socialist community. Last year's editorial had made pointed 
charges about Soviet troop deployments along the Chinese border 
and portrayed a threat from the Soviets. The change in mood is 
reflected in the difference in the titles of the anniversary 
editorials, last year's "Heighten Vigilance, Defend the Motherland" 
now giving way to a vacuous "Commemorate 1 Aug tat, Army Day."

EDITORIAL SEEMS TO DOWNGRADE LIN WHILE STRESSING CCP CONTROL 
The joint editorial seems to diminish somewhat the status of 
Mao and Lin vis-a-vis the PLA, especially that of Lin as the 
leader currently in control Of the PLA. Along with other 
Army Day articles and speeches the editorial speaks of the 
FLA as a force "founded and led" by Mao and "commanded" by 
Lin; previously, since 1967, the general practice has been 
to refer to the PLA as "personally founded and led" by Mao 
and "directly commanded" by Lin. Also, the toasts proclaimed 
by Huang Yung-sheng at the reception banquet refer to Mao 
as "great leader" rather than "supreme commander" and drop 
Lin's title of "deputy supreme commander." 
In addition, the editorial depersonalizes the control of 
the army by noting that the army places itself "under 
the party's absolute leadership, going where the party, 
directs," though it is still "acting as Chairman Mao teaches." 
And the army "identifies its responsibility to the people with 
its responsibility to the leading organs of the party." 
Officially, Lin's direct control over the military seems to 
be unchanged with Army Day messages still referring to him 
as Minister of National Defense. The new format may merely 
reflect a felt need to downplay Lin's military role somewhat 
so as not to call into question the dictum, "the party 
commands the gun," should he accede to the party chairmanship. 
The editorial does seem to go further in this direction than 
strictly necessarr, however. For the first time since the 
cultural revolution began, tne Army Day editorial contains 
no quotation from Lin which all should heed, not even his 
injunction to study Mao. And in an unusual remark, bordering 
on a warning to anyone trying to force a policy against the 
army's collective will, the editorial observes that the army 
"has maintained remarkable unity in its own ranks as well as 
with those outside its ranks." 
At the same time, in a marked departure from previous 
practice, the editorial stresses that the PLA must be firmly 
under party control. For the first time on Army Day since 
1967, when radical leaders with power over the media used 
separate editorials in PEOPLE'S DAILY, RED FLAG, and 
LIBERATION ARMY DAILY to urge closer control over the 
military, the editorial this year noted Mao's statement 
that "the party colmnaads the gun, and the gun must never

be allowed to command the party." The PLA is referred to as 
d powerful weapon of the CCP and the Chinese people," 
invincible only because it is "boundlessly loyal to the party, 
the people, the great leader Chairman Mao, and his proletarian 
revolutionary line.? 
The theme of party control over the army, which 4s intermittently 
trought to notice in Chinese propaganda, had not ceen raised 
i4 recent Army Day editorials. The re-emergence of the theme 
in the editorial this year may reflect the fact of the formation 
of provincial party organs to which local units should look for 
party control. Since most party committees are headed by military 
leaders,much of the possible opposition to a reassertion of party 
corrol would probably be neutralized. 
Probably, however, the reassertion of party authority is a reflection 
of a more general campaign for ideological rectification aimed 
at remnants of the 16 May group; although a "radical!' group, it 
has been closely tied by Peking to elements in the army including 
deposed acting chief of staff Yang Cheng-wu. The fallibility of 
the army when not led by party leadership imbued with Mao's 
thought was the major thesis of an NCNA article on 31 July which 
reviewed the history of the PLA with emphasis on the line that 
"whenever Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is interfered with, 
the army suffers losses." 
This ticle contains reminiscences by an old soldier recalling 
deviations from both the left and the right which resulted in 
disasters. It outlines Mao's specific actions for instituting 
party control over the PLA, with party braLches and committees at 
all levels, carrying the system up to "the whole army" which was 
placed "under the unified leadership of the front committee of 
the party." The article does not specify that the civilian party 
apparatus exercised power over the military at any level below the 
central apparatus, possibly an indication that the current campaign 
for greater party cc_trol refers to the role of the party vis-a-vis 
the army in strem;thening ideological controls rather than to the 
assumption of control over the military by local civil party organs.

plus Standirg Committee members Chen Po-La and Kang Sheng, and 
PRC Vice Chairman Tung P1-vu. Lin Piao has not appeared, at 
the annual Army Day reception since before the start of the 
cultural revolution. 
On this occasion, for the first time pince the Ninth Party 
Congress in 1969, the leaders present for a major holiday 
turnout were listed according to Politburo rank rather than 
stroke order (Chinese equivalent of alphabetical order). There 
have previously been partial leadership turnouts in which the 
names were listed in non-stroke order, but the nature of the 
occasion -- government, cultural, or whatever -- obviated any 
strictly hierarchical listing. 
Now the Army Day rankings confirm that Mao's wife, Chiang Ching, 
ranks above PLA Chief of Staff Huang Yung-sheng. In 1970 there 
had been some variation in their listings; earlier tht7 year, when 
they both appeared, Chiang had always been listed first, but 
these occasions were mostly of a cultural nature. Her senior 
party position now seems to be confirmed by the fact that ghe is 
listed, on Army Day, ahead of Huang. 
Chu Te is the only Politburo member to be making his initial 
appearance under non-stroke-order conditions. Although the aged 
military leader probably retains little effective power, he does 
hold on to a middle Politburr ranking, above several active 
members. 
Among secondary leaders attending the reception was Teng Hai-ching, 
former head of the revolutionary committee in Inner Mongolia. He 
is the first deposed provincial chief to surface in the official 
media--and after he had made po public appearances since October 1969. 
Teng was listed among other PLA leaders in a group that included 
officers from the Peking Military Region, of which he was formerly 
a deputy commander. He is ranked following all other full Central 
Committee members in the group.

SOVIET BLOC RELATIONS 
BLOC LEADERS, MINUS CEAUSESCU, STRESS UNITY AT CRIMEA MEETING 
Moscow's concern to present a united front with its allies in 
the face of the developing Peking-Washington rapprochement and 
the recent events in the Middle East is registered in the 
communique on the 2 August meeting of "several" Soviet bloc 
first secretaries "vacationing" in the Crimea after the CEMA 
Council session of 27-29 July. The 2 August communique also 
reflects mounting Soviet concern over Romania's continuing 
resistance to coordination of its foreign policy with its 
Warsaw Pact allies. Romania's Ceausescu was the conspicuous 
sole absentee in the Crimea, in the wake of the CEMA session 
in Bucharest where the Romanians apparently succeeded in 
watering down the Soviet Union's plans for economic 
"integration" as one facet of its drive to cement bloc unity. 
The communique on the Crimea meeting emphasizes the "mounting 
importance" of "cooperation" among the socialist countries 
"on the basis of the principles of Marxism-Leninism and 
socialist internationalism"--code words for loyalty to 
Moscow. Arguing the need for communist unity in the context 
of the class struggle, the document reaffirms the "correctness" 
of the stand of the Moscow international party conference of 
June 1969 on the continuing need to combat "rightwing and 
leftwing opportunism" and to rally "all progressive and 
national liberation forces in the anti-imperialist struggle." 
The party chiefs, according to the communique, "touched on 
topical questions of the development of the world communist 
movement as well as foreign policy problems of mutual interest." 
Following statements of Soviet positions on European problems, 
Indochina, and the Middle East,* it says the meeting passed 
in "a cordial, friendly atmosphere and was marked by complete 
unanimity and mutual understanding on all the questions 
considered." In addition to Brezhnev, Podgornyy, and 
Shelest, the Soviet delegation included Katushev and 
Ponomarev, CPSU secretaries in charge of ruling and nonruling 
international party affairs, respectively.

Luau(' of relation(' with China in the Crimea deliberations wan 
pointed up In a talk broadcast by Radio Prague in Czech and 
Slovak to citizenn abroad on the 3d. Strensing the "political 
nignificance" of the Crimea meeting in view of the "hectic 
pace of political events" internationally, the commentator 
remarked that "Washington is evolving v detailed concept of 
how to exploit a new factor in international relations: the 
activity of the People's Republic of China with regard to 
the United States." It added that this policy "has the 
evident intention to weaken the positions of the Soviet Union" 
and the socialist countries' peace offensive. 
ADN's report of a 4 August NEUES DEUTSCHLAND editorial on the 
Crimea meeting begins and ends on a note of the urgency of 
communist unity. It says "the meeting again proven that 
unity and its further consolidation are the determining 
factor in the community of socialist states," adding here 
that the GDR is "a firm and unshakable part of this community." 
After reviewing the subjects discussed at the meeting, it 
stresses that "unity in the broadest sense is needed" to 
solve these tasks. 
A 4 August RUDE PRAVO editorial on the meeting, citing 
"differences in views in the international communist movement," 
says "world imperialism . . . is attempting to misuse various 
revisionistic trends, Trotskyism, and anarchistic tendencies" 
to dilute socialism's world influence and weaken communist 
unity. It adds that "events of recent weeks" indicate that 
the imperialists are "attempting to misuse anti-Sovietism, 
covering up their antisocialist aims with leftwing cliches," 
which it says demonstrate the need for struggle against 
right and left opportunism to strengthen unity.

BEHAVIOR that the Crimea meeting was held, listing the 
participants and noting that the East European 
leaders were "now vacationing in the Soviet Union." On

Also on 3 Augunt, the Romaniann lined the forum of the Geneva 
dlinaTuumnit talks to reiterate their views on the need for 
regional disarmament measuree in the Balkans and more broadly--
according to AOERPRES? account of remarks at the session by 
Romanian Ambassador Ion Datchu--for withdrawal of foreign 
troops to their own national boundaries, for concomitant 
abolition or military blocs, and for all countries to "refrain 
from any act generating tension." On the same day, TABS and 
MTI announced the start of Warsaw Pact "tactical cooperation 
maneuvers" code-named Opal 71 involving Soviet, Czechoslovak, 
and Hungarian troopc under the direction of the Huncarian 
Defense Ministry, presumably taking place chiefly on the 
territory of Romania's northwest neighbor. 
CEMA COMMUNIQUE REFLECTS PRICE OF "UNANIMITY" ON INTWATION 
Released in the media of the CEMA member countries on 29 July, 
the communique on the 25th CEMA Council session emerges as a 
patchwork document reflecting the compromises necessary to 
achieve "unanimity" on the 15-20 year "complex program" for 
phased economic integration. Hungarian Premier Fock, in an 
MTI interview after his return home, stated that the program 
had not been "adopted smoothly" and that there were "serious 
debates." The communique, phrased in such a way as to 
accommodate the varying and conflicting views of the 
implications and acceptable bounds of "integration," contains 
ingredients that have enabled each of the participants to 
express satisfaction in subsequent comment--and in the 
process to bring the differences and crosscurrents into 
sharper relief. 
Treating the new program in broad general terms, in advance 
of its publication in full in the press "in the ensuing 
days," the communique is at pains to emphasize that the 
program "has been endorsed unanimously." It underscores 
in another passage the formal commitment secured from all 
the participants: They "reasserted unanimously that their 
countries are absolutely willing to undertake every 
organizational, economic, and juridical measure that is 
necessary to ensure an efficient fulfillment of the complex 
program." It asserts that the 24th CEMA Council session in 
Warsaw in May 1970 had also "unanimously" endorsed the 
integration program in its earlier developmental stage, 
although the 14 May 1970 communique had merely said that the 
gathering "discussed" the CEMA Executive Committee's report 
on the progress of work on the program.

Passages registering tIne price of "unanimity" emphanize that 
economic cooperation under CEMA in between "equal and 
novereign" socialist otaten and, along with "Docialist 
internationalism," embodies "respect for ntate sovereignty, 
independence and national interests, noninterference in the 
internal affairs of the countries, fully equal rights and 
free consent, mutual advantage and comradely recinrocal 
assistance." This recitation of the litany of tenets 
cherished by the Romanians is followed by a direct response 
to one of their vocal objections: an assurance that Racialist 
"integration" does not imply the creation of "supranational 
bodies," specifically welcomed in Romania's post-session 
comment expressing general satisfaction with the document. 
The communique records without elaboration a formalization 
of the coordination of national economic plans in the form 
of a new CEMA "committee for cooperation in the domain of 
planning." While Romania's post-session appraisal in SCINTEIA 
emphasizes that the new program is based on free consent and 
entails no infringement on national self-management, a PAP 
interview with Polish Deputy Premier Jagielski on 30 July, 
a RUDE PRAVO interview with Czechoslovak Premier Strougal 
on the 31st, and a RUDE PRAVO commentary on 3 August all 
make the point that "joint planning" of certain economic 
processes will be a part of the integration program. Prior 
to the Bucharest session, Radio Moscow on 22 July had 
resurfaced the concept of future "international planning 
organs" and a single "joint" economic plan as an eventual 
outgrowth of the coordination of national plans.* And Radio 
Sofia did its Soviet mentor one better in evoking on the 
30th Lenin's grandiose vision of a future "world communist 
economy" governed by "a previously coordinated plan." 
HARDCORE ALLIES PICTURE CEMA AS INSTRUMENT OF POLITICAL UNITY 
The broad political context in which Moscow views CEMA 
integration is indicated in the CEMA Council communique 
in the statement, echoed in the communique on the Crimea 
meeting, that the new program "will consolidate still more 
the political unity and cohesion of the fraternal socialist 
countries." And in post-session comment Czechoslovak, 
Polish, East German, .:nd Bulgarian media have seconded 
Moscow's portrayal of CEMA in the perspective of all-round 
efforts to cement Soviet bloc unity and strength

community." GDR Premier Otoph declared in an East Berlin 
radio interview on 29 July that the program will strengthen 
the political unity and cohesion of the socialist community 
in the struggle between the two major world systems. The 
CSSR'a Strougal said in his 31 July RUDE PRAVO interview 
that the program will have a positive effect "in the 
broader political context" and contribute to "deepening 
unified procedure in the other fields of activity" of the 
parties and states. 
Bulgarian Premier Todorov, replying to a toast by Ceausescu 
at a luncheon after the close of the CERA session, pointed 
to the new program's "great political and ideological" as 
well as economic importance; and Radio Sofia on 30 July 
said it "creates the prerequisites for the further 
strengthening of our economic cooperation, for increasing 
the might of the socialist community, or, in other words, 
for strengthening the might of the progressive and 
revolutionary forces which determine the development of 
the world revolutionary process." 
The speech at the CERA session by Polish Premier Jaroszewicz, 
published first in summary form in TRYBUNA LUDU on 29 July 
and then in full on 1 August, characterized the integration 
program as strengthening "the ideological, political, and 
defensive unity of the CEMA countries" and coupled transparent 
admonitions to the Romanians on the importance of unity 
with reminders of the effective support and help the CERA 
countries receive from the Soviet Union. Stating that "the 
Polish communists and patriots take the view that the Soviet 
Union is the mainstay of the historic opportunity for 
socialist construction and for success in the world," 
Jaroszewicz added pointedly that "this is how the communists 
and patriots of all CEMA countries think and feel." He 
declared that CERA countries and their parties should "oppose 
in a principled way" all attempts to weaken unity. He went 
on to stress that "the internationalist unity of the countries 
of CEMA and the Warsaw Pact is one of the basic factors in the 
struggle against revisionism, nationalism, and dOgmatism," 
adding that "any lack of comprehension regarding this duty 
damages our joint interests."

HUNGARIAN PREMIER STRESSES CONTINUING CONTACTS WITH WEST 
Where Moscow's other allies played up the concept of economic 
integration as one inseparable facet of a comprehensive unity 
centered in Moscow, Hungary kept its discussion of the CEMA 
program largely in the economic context and betrayed special 
concern to present the program as no deterrence to an 
expansion of economic ties to the West. 
This concern came through most clearly in MTI's interview 
with Premier Fock on his return to Budapest on the 29th. 
Fock said the new program "does not mean any change whatsoever" 
In Hungarian relations with countries "not participating in 
integration." He added that "we want to continue to trade 
with all countries" on the basis of mutual advantage and that 
the program "does not mean that we isolate ourselves," but 
rather "encourages us to create stronger contacts, while 
concentrating our forces, with countries which are outside 
the integration." Fock's remarks on this score amplified the 
statement in the Bucharest communique to the effect that 
any country outside CEMA membership may take part totally 
or partially" in carrying out the program and that the CEMA 
countries would "continue expanding economic and technico-
scientific links with the developing countries and with the 
developed capitalist states," on the basis of peaceful 
coexistence, equal rights, and respect for sovereignty. 
Fock also said the integration program "takes far-reaching 
account of the principle of individual interest"--cases 
in which "all CEMA countries do not participate" in certain 
partial measures." He added that "the fact that one or 
two countries d.Q not participate in a certain action cannot 
be an obstacle to the cooperation of the other interested 
countries." 
ROMANIA INSISTS CEMA INTEGRATION WILL NOT AFFECT SOVEREIGNTY 
Bucharest followed its customary pattern of treatment of 
major bloc events in which it participates, publishing the 
CEMA communique in all the Romanian dailies on 30 July and 
following up with its own interpretation in an authoritative 
article in SCINTEIA on 1 August. Reflecting apparent 
satisfaction at the outcome of the session, the article,by 
I. Fintinaru, hailed the new CEMA program as "a good start" 
and assured the Romanian people and foreign friends that 
the further movement toward bloc integration will not infringe 
on Romanian sovereignty.

The SCINTEIA article, as reviewed by AGERPRES on 1 August, 
made clear that it was only the spirit of compromise and 
understanding at the CEMA meeting that enabled the Romanians 
to endorse the program document. It cautioned that now "the 
manner in which the concrete provisions are materialized 
becomes essential." As if to drive home this point, it . 
added: "The Romanian party and pe,..ide express their 
conviction that the self-same constructive spirit, of mutual 
understanding and cooperation, which allowed for the 
unanimous endorsement of the program will become the 
permanent feature of the practical activity carried on for 
translating into life its provisions." 
In passages calculated to reassure the Romanian people on 
the sensitive issue of "integration," a term Bucharest media 
have normally avoided, the article noted that integration 
has been "the object of multiple concerns" and discussions 
and explained the Romanian leadership's view "that socialist 
integration must be approached as distinct from the aim 
attached to it in capitalist relations [and by implication 
also in the Soviet Union] and that it does not mean infringement 
of national independence and sovereignty." 
The article went on to explain that "by integration we mean a 
diversification and expansion of the forms of rmoperation 
which, by observing the sovereign decisions of each party 
and government, should lead to faster development of their 
productive forces. . . In this sense, the article added, 
the complex CEMA program alluded to in the communique 
"clearly specifies that socialist integration proceeds on 
the basis of fully free consent and is not accompanied by the 
creation of supranational bodies, does not affect the 
questions of internal planning, of financial activity 
and economic self-management." Further emphasizing the 
voluntary nature of participation in CEMA projects, 
SCINTEIA went on to recall that the original CERA 
charter stipulated that relations among the member 
countries would be based on "fully equal rights" and "free 
consent." 
Stating that the CEMA pr)gram would be in the economic 
interests of all its me-.Jers, the article used circuitous 
language apparently designed to counter the notion that it 
would imply political integration: "The multilateral 
cooperation between the socialist countries has not, and 
cannot have, other objective and basic meaning than the

accelerated and economic growth, the material and apiritual 
advancement of the society of each socialist country taken 
separately . . ." In this context the article repeated 
the stock Romanian argument that Bucharest lives up to its 
international socialist obligations mainly by building 
socialism in Romania. 
In a passage apparently designed to reassure the Chinese 
that Romania's endorsement of the CEMA program document 
portends no change in Romania's neutralist postme in the 
Sino-Soviet dispute, SCINTEIA reaffirmed that in addition 
to expanding cooperation in CEMA, Romania will continue to 
pursue cooperation with "all other socialist countries, to 
act on all paths for making its own active contribution to 
overcoming difficulties, to strengthen the unity of all 
the socialist countries." The article also contained an 
assurance that Romania "will act to expand cooperation 
with all the countries of the world, irrespective of 
social system."

NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT 
PRAVDA ANTICIPATES PRC REJECTION OF FIVE-POWER CONFERENCE BID 
Soviet media have said nothing about an official Chinese response 
to the Soviet proposal for a five-power nuclear disarmament 
conference, in the absence so far of any Peking publicity for 
the PRC rejection which Western press report:- say was delivered 
to the Soviet embassy on 30 July. But a PRAVDA review of world 
reactions to the proposal on 30 July anticipated an unfavorable 
Chinese response in noting Western press reports that Chou 
En-lai had indicated a negative attitude toward the idea in 
talks with U.S. newsmen--a belated allusion to the substance of 
Chou's comments to the journalists on 21 June, shortly after 
the Soviet proposal had been sent to Washington, Paris, London, 
and Peking and the day before it was released in Soviet media. 
Peking, which has yet to publicly acknowledge he existence of 
the Soviet proposal, used the joint editorial marking the 
Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) anniversary in PEOPLE'S 
DAILY, RED FLAG, and LIBERATION ARMY DAILY on 1 August to accuse 
the nuclear superpowers of hypocrisy in caliing for disarmament: 
"Although U.S. imperialism and social-imperialism talk about 
disarmament every day, they are actually engaged in arms 
expansion all the time," and "while carrying on nuclear 
blackmail, they are actively preparing to fight large-scale 
conventionea war." 
The Polisn news agency, PAP, in a Warsaw-datelined review on 
1 August of the PLA anniversary observance in Peking, noted 
that r;hinese comment was full of "anti-Soviet invective" and 
in his context attributed to "Peking diplomatic circles" 
the report that "the Chinese government turned down" the 
Soviet bid fox a meeting of the five nuclear powers. 
PRAVDA ON CHOU'S The 30 July PRAVDA article on world 
JUNE COMMENTS reactions to the Soviet proposal, by 
V. Demin, said the PRC "has stated that 
it will examine the proposal" but added that according to 
Western press reports "the PRC is not displaying interest" 
in it. Demin said the reports to this effect were based on 
"the talks between Chou En-lai and American journalists" 
during which Chou "expressed reservations with regard to 
convening a conference" of the five powers. TASS on 
23 June had cited a New York TIMES report of Chou's comments

to the newsmen on the 21st, noting that he said he "would 
discuss" the Soviet proposal; but TASS did not at that time 
mention the TIMES' observation that Chou indicated reservations. 
The day after the Demin article appeared in PRAVDA, a Moscow 
broadcast in Mandarin said foreign press reports noted 
"recently" that the PRC "does not show much interest in the 
proposed conference of the five nuclear powers" and specified 
that the reports were based on Chou's comments to the 
newsmen on 21 June. 
Demin's article contained a clear allusion to the PRC's own 
call for a world summit conference on nuclear disarmament, 
including both nuclear and non-nuclear countries, in reminding 
the unnamed advocates of such a forum that the Soviet Union 
"never has been and is not now against such a conference" 
and in recalling that the idea had been endorsed at the 24th 
CPSU Congress.* 
PRAVDA ON REACTIONS Rounding up Western reactions to the 
FROM WESTERN CAPITALS bid for a five-power conference, the 
Demin article said France had "already 
expressed its positive attitude." He cited a U.S. State 
Department spokesman to the effect that the United States would 
study the proposal and would consult with its allies, adding 
that the United States had indicated at the Geneva disarmament 
talks that "there exist a number of prol_lems which should be 
discussed precisely by the nuclear powers themselves"--a 
quotation from James Leonard, at the opening session of the 
Geneva talks on 29 June, which Moscow has cited before. As 
for the British, Dcmin said U.K. Foreign Secretary Douglas-Home 
had noted that London was studying the proposal and that the 
United Kingdom "will undoubtedly wish to be represented" at 
a five-power conference. 
Demin went on to respond to arguments against the Soviet plan, 
including "pessimistic sentiments" and "lack of confidence" 
in its chances for success. He rejected the "strange logic" 
that the nuclear powers "are at different levels of development" 
* See the TRENDS of 8 July 1971, page 22, for recent back-
ground on Peking propaganda pressing the long-standing PRC 
proposal for a world conference to discuss the complete 
prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, with 
an agreement on non-use of the weapons to be reached as a 
first step.

and that this would preclude the possibility of agreement. 
And he decried "groundless and irresponsible allegations" 
that the Soviet proposal is "aimed at creating difficulties 
for the other nuclear powers." 
IMPACT ON SALT Discounting Western speculation that a 
conference of nuclear powers "could 
supposedly create an obstacle to progress at the strategic 
arms limitation talks (SALT)," Demin stated categorically 
that "a conference of the five cannot replace the bilateral 
talks that are already being held between the USSR and the 
United States" because "the questions on their agendas differ.' 
While a five-power conference would discuss "a wide range of 
measures 'or nuclear disarmament, affecting all the nuclear 
powers," he said, "at the bilateral Soviet-American meetings 
the narrower issue of limiting the systems of strategic 
defensive and offensive weapons which the United States and 
the Soviet Union now possess is being examined."

SUDAN 
OBSERVER ARTICLE. TASS STATEMENT HIGHLIGHT PROTEST CAMPAIGN 
Moscow's voluminous campaign protesting the "bloody terror" in 
Sudan and the execution of three leading Sudanese Communist 
Party (SCP) members gained momentum after the release of the 
27 July TASS statement, with reports of protest meetings throughout 
the Soviet Union and statements by Soviet public organizations.* 
Concurrently, TASS continues to carry terse reports stating that 
"reprisals continue" in Sudan, briefly noting further arrests and 
prison sentences and ministerial changes. The first press comment 
comes on the 30th in an "Observer" article published in both PRAVDA 
and IZVESTIYA which objected to "imperialist" allegations that the 
19 July coup was directed from Moscow, and first raised the question 
of future Soviet-Sudanese relations. A second TASS statement, on 
31 July, which revealed that the Soviet leaders had sent protests to 
Sudanese Chairman an-Numayri on the 25th and 26th, complained of 
"unfriendly acts" against Soviet representatives in Sudan, and went 
beyond the Observer article in asking whether the Sudanese leadership 
wished to maintain friendly relations or "push the matter to their 
curtailment and possibly disruption." 
There is as yet no monitored reaction from Soviet or Bulgarian media 
to Khartoum's diplomatic moves: an-Numayri's 31 July ultimatum to 
the Soviet ambassador to end Soviet attacks on his regime within 
48 hours, as reported in an interview with an-Numayri in the 
1 August London OBSERVER; Omdurman radio's 1 August announcement 
that the Sudanese ambassador to the USSR and Bulgaria was being 
withdrawn; and the 2 August Omdurman announcement that the 
Bulgarian ambassador and the Soviet embassy counselor had been 
declared personae non gratae.** According to a MIDDLE EAST NEWS 
* Moscow's current propaganda campaign is reminiscent of its 
campaign in early 1963 against persecution of communists in Iraq 
which was highlighted by two CPSU Central Committee statements, 
editorial comment in PRAVDA, and reports of protest meetings. 
See the FBIS SURVEY OF COMMUNIST BLOC BROADCASTS, 21 February 
1963, pp. 11-15, 7 March 1963, pp. 14-16, and 21 March 1963, pp.15-16. 
** Sofia radio on the 3d does report Khartoum's recall of some 
Sudanese ambassadors from other posts, but not from Bulgaria. DPA 
is the only source of a report from Khartoum on the 3d that a spokes-
man of the Soviet embassy said the USSR had protested the expulsion 
of the Soviet counselor.

AGENCY (MENA) report from Khartoum on the 3d, a Sudanese Foreign 
Ministry official said the two were expelled because they were 
in contact with the 19 July coup leaders. The official s'so 
reportedly said that the recall of the Sudanese ambassador "does 
not absolutely mean that we have requested or will request the 
Soviet Union to withdraw its ambassador." 
OBSERVER ARTICLE, The PRAVDA-IZVESTIYA Observer article takes 
TASS STATEMENT several tacks in approaching the Sudanese 
developments, suggesting concern that the 
SCP will be "completely liquidated" and that "anticommunist 
repression" may spread to other Arab countries, defending the 
history and role of the SCP, reacting somewhat defensively to 
"imperialist" allegations of Soviet collusion in the 19 July 
abortive coup, proclaiming Moscow's credentials as a supporter 
of the Arabs, and bringing up for the first time the question of 
the effect of the Sudan events on bilateral relations. 
Observer proclaims strict Soviet obse'vance of the policy of 
noninterference in the internal affairs of Arab states. But 
at the same time the article somewhat contradictorily states 
that the Soviet people are not indifferent to the destinies of 
the fighters against imperialism, and "no one should have any 
illusions in this respect." And Observer, broaching the 
question of state relations, finds it "strange, to say the least," 
that "certain Sudanese leaders" should declare that the 
reprisals against communists will not influence the close 
Soviet-Sudanese relations. These themes are replayed in followup 
propaganda. 
The second TASS statement on Sudan in five days underscores 
throughout the views of "Soviet leading circles" while disclosing 
representations to an-Numayri on 25 and 26 July appealing for an 
end to harsh sentences on Sudanese "public leaders" and protesting 
"unfriendly actions" against Soviet representatives in Sudan. The 
Observer article had foreshadowed the revelation of the Soviet 
leaders' appeals in noting "numerous calls of the Soviet leaders" 
to the Sudanese authorities and, like the TASS statement, 
complaining that these appeals went unheeded. 
According to the TASS statement, Podgornyy's appeal against harsh 
sentences, in a message on the 25th, was followed by a statement 
by "the Soviet leaders" on the 26th conveyed through the Soviet 
ambassador in Khartoum, which "emphatically" appealed to an-Numayri 
not to resort to extreme measures and professed not to understand

Involved" in the 19 July evento. TAM complaino that therm 
appeals went unheeded; Sudaneoe trade union leader Ahmad 
ash-Shaykh and SCP leaders Garang and Mahjub fell victim to the 
"bloody reign of terror," it pays, adding that the CPO and 
the Soviet people "angrily denounce" these "cruel measures." 
(Podgornyy's appeal preceded Ahmad ash-Shaykh's execution by 
one day; Garang and Mahjub were executed on the 27th and 28th.) 
TASS conveys the impression that the second representation 
dealt primarily with bilateral relations, noting that the Soviet 
leaders' statement emphaoized that the USSR "does not intend" to 
interfere in Sudanese internal affairs but that at the same time 
it called attention to "certain actions" of Sudanese authorities 
harming Soviet-Sudanese "good relations." They had in view, TASS 
reveals, "unfriendly actions against Soviet representatives in 
Sudan, damage to property, th:eats and acts of violence against 
Soviet officials in Khartoum." In light of such "provocative 
acts," TASS adds, the question naturally arises as to whether 
the Sudanese leadership is willing to maintain friendly relations 
or to push the matter to "their curtailment and possibly 
disruption." Maintaining and developing Soviet-Sudanese relations 
can only be accomplished if the leaderships of both countries 
work to this end, TASS declares. 
While Observer claims that imperialist circles, wishing the 
anticommunist hysteria to take an anti-Soviet direction, assert 
that the "so-called 'movement of 19 July' was allegedly directed 
from Moscow," the TASS statement says that in Sudan "as beyond its 
borders there are forces"--unspecified--who would like to shift 
the responsibility "for some or other domestic events" onto the 
Soviet Union. 
OTHER MOSCOW Still another elite statement--the communique on 
COMMENT the 2 August meeting in Crimea of Soviet party 
and government leaders with party leaders from 
East Europe (except Romania) and Mongolia--expressed "grave 
alarm" in connection with the "ruthless terror" against the SCP 
and other democratic organizations in Sudan. Typifying Soviet 
and East European propaganda protests, the statement "strongly 
condemned" the "lawlessness and arbitrariness" of the Sudanese 
authorities which are'bxploited by the forces of imperialism 
and reaction against the interests of the Sudanese people."

Broadcast comment In Arabic has stressed thin theme, charging 
imperialism and Israel with exploitinE the Sudan events to 
split the Arab anti-imperialisL front and drive a wedge between 
the Arabs and the Soviet Union. A broadcast in Arabic on the 3d 
pegged to the Crimea meeting stresses the socialist countries' 
past ald present support of the Arab cause, pointedly noting 
that the Arabs realize what it means to have a dispute with the 
USSR, for without the strong support of the socialist countries 
against Israel "they would be compelled to resort to the 
colonialists." 
Minimal attention to Assistant Secretary Siscols current talks 
in Israel brings up Sudan along the same lines: A Volskiy 
domestic service commentary on the 3d, for example, charges 
Washington and Tel Aviv with trying to split the Arab front as 
well as impair Arab-Soviet relations. And he recalls the 
statement in the CPSU-Arab Socialist Union (ASU) communique on 
Ponomarev's 20-30 July visit to Egypt on the dangers of 
anticommunism. This passage in the communique?clearly initiated 
by the Soviets in light of the Sudanese developments--says that 
anticommumism serves only the interests of imperialism and reaction, 
and it claims that attempts to spread anticommunism are aimed at 
splitting the ranks of the Arab fighters against Imperialism, 
Zionism, and Israeli aggression. 
REPORTS ON Soviet media have extensively publicized 
ARAB REACTION world-wide protests, primarily from foreign 
and East European and international front 
organizations. But there is a noticeable dearth of reports on 
Arab reaction, Moscow selectively publicizing criticism from 
such predictable sources as the Arab CPs, Lebanese leftists, and 
some Arab trade unions. Staying clear of the Iraqi-Sudanese 
dispute in the wake of the 19 July events, Moscow apparently has 
failed to mention Baghdad assaults on an-Numa:ri. 
The only criticism heard to emanate from the UAR--a statement by 
the executive council of the UAR General Federation of Workers, 
expressing "shock" at the "bloody incidents" and arrests of 
trade union leaders--was reported by the MIDDLE EAST NEWS AGENCY

OTHER BLOC Soviet media have chastised Peking for its 
REACTION "eloquent silence" on the "bloody terror" in Sudan, 
TASS on the 30th noting that according to Omdurman 
radio an-Numayri had addressed a message to Mao expressing the 
conviction that Sudanese-PRC "excellent relations" would be 
further consolidated. A Radio Peace and Progress broadcast in 
Mandarin on 28 July and a Moscow broadcast to Czechoslovakia 
on the 30th pointed out that the sole NCNA dispatch--on 26 July--
said not a word about the persecution of communists. In a speech 
to the armed forces on 2 August, reported by Omdurman radio on 
the 3d, an-Numayri expressed appreciation for messages from "the 
friendly FRC, dear Korea," and other states. 
The DPRK and Albania have apparently maintained silence on the 
Sudanese events, while pointedly issuing denunciations of 
Jordanian "provocations" against the Palestinian guerrillas--an 
Albanian women's union statement on 28 July and a DPRK Foreign 
Ministry spokesman's statement on 2 August. The other East 
Europeans, Mongolia, and the DRV have all protested in various 
fashions and at various levels. The Bulgarian and Romanian 
party central committees issued declarations and the Hungarian 
MTI carried an authorized statement. Bulgaria's Zhivkov, the 
GDR's Ulbricht, and Mongolia's Sambuu sent messages to an-Numayri, 
while a Tito envoy, Josip Djerdja, has had talks in Cairo and 
Khartoum. 
COMMUNIST MEDIA VARY ON ROLE OF SUDAN CP IN 19 JULY COUP 
Communist media, when referring at all to the 19 July abortive coup, 
have tended to deny SCP participation, North Vietnam alone mention-
ing SCP "active participation" and a Hungarian paper seemingly 
implying at least some party sympathy. Moscow's few references 
underline SCP nonin7olvement, TASS even obscuring an acknowledgment 
by an SCP Politburo member that the party "supported" the movement. 
Thus TASS on 2 August briefly reported Sudanese CP Politburo member 
tzz ad-Din hli 'noires telling the French CP daily L'HUMANITE that 
the Sudanese LT did not take part in the 19 July events. But it 
did not include his additional remark, as published in L'HUMANITE

on the 2d, that the SCP supported the 19 July coup because its

A VNA report of a 30 July NHAN DAN editorial on the Sudan 
"massacre" is notable for the statement that the 19 July coup 
"was conducted with the active participation" of workers, 
peasants, progressive army officers, and "members of the SCP." 
Broadcast excerpts of the editorial in the domestic service and 
in English- and French-language services failed to include this 
statement, as did TASS' 30 July report on the editorial. The 
Hungarian MAGYAR NEMZET, in an article reviewed by MTI on the 
28th, also seemedto hint at SCP involvement in ambiguously 
stating that the 19 July "putsch" was a consequence of an-Numayri's 
policy, "for the group of leftist officers executed in the 
meantime, the Sudanese Communist Party, and the mass organizations 
did not want to watch passively what was happening." 
Other communist references to the initial coup, however, have 
disclaimed SCP involvement. A participant in the 1 August 
Moscow domestic service commentators' roundtable complained 
that the Sudanese leaders accused the SCP of beng behind the 
19 July "plotters, although the facts do not confirm this in the 
least." And TASS on the 28th reported the Paris FIGARO as 
commenting that it was doubtful that SCP Secretary General 
Mahjub took personal part in planning the "purely military 
coup." An East Berlin commentary on the same day cautiously 
observed that the background and causes of the 19 July coup 
were "still obscure," but the Polish ZOLNIERZ WOLNOSCI, 
according to PAP on the 29th, stressed that the architects of the 
abortive coup "were not communists at all." Similarly, French CP 
leader Marchais claimed in a speech reported in L'HUMANITE on the 
29th that SCP head Mahjub had shown that the SCP "had never 
participated in any plot."

L'UNITA, FRENCH CP The Italian Communist Party organ L'UNITA 
ON HAYKAL, UAR PRESS promptly attacked Muhammad Haykal, editor 
of Cairc's AL-AiiltAM, for his views on the 
Sudanese Communist Party (SCP) expressed in a 30 July article. 
Haykal's assertion that the SCP "committed a 'historical error' by 
aiming at exclusive control of Sudan" is branded in a 31 July 
article by Jacoviello as not only one of Haykal's "flagrant lies" 
but a matter of infamy. Jacoviello maintained that the party's 
history demonstrates exactly the opposite of Haykal's 
"pseudotheoretical disquisitions," but failed to reproduce 
his specific criticisms. He suggested that if Haykal wanted to 
present the truth he should publish--as L'UNITA did in the same 
issue--a February 1960 speech by SCP Secretary General Mahjub 
illustrating SCP policy "on the question of coups." 
At the same time, Jacoviello criticized HaykeL for refraining 
from any reproach of "Sudan's Tshombe," Chairman an-Numayri, 
but professed to understand his silence in that an-Numayri is 
considered "a preclous ally" by "those in Egypt" who share 
Haykal's orientation--seemingly a slur on President as-Sadat 
himself. The article went on to dispute Haykal's statement 
that as-Sadat "supposedly intervened" with an-Numayri to try 
to sav:: the life of the late trade union lender Ahmad ash-Shaykh. 
"We happen to know," Jacoviello said, that as-Sadat conveyed to 
an-Numayri a mcssage by Podgornyy "without adding anything of 
his own to that message." 
Haykal noyd that some European CPs "slipped into the pitfall" 
of supporting the 19 July movement and called this "unjustified 
Ignorance." He anticipated an uproar over Ahmed ash-Shaykh's 
execution, and commiserated. with the USSR on its unenviable 
situation: "It cannot interfere and it cannot remain si.ent" 
under pressure from trade union movements and the communict 
parties, especially in Western Europe. 
Another swipe at the Egyptians came from French CP leader Georges 
Marchais in a speech at a PCF demonstration on Sudan, reported 
in the 29 July PCF organ L'HUMANITE. Rejecting any complicity 
with the Sudanese "executioners,"Marchais said the PCF had 
denounced the "dishonorable attitude" of the Libyan leaders who 
had encouraged an-Numayri and had even delivered some victims 
into his hands. . And the PCF, he said, found it "unforgivable" 
that "some Egyptian rapers" published "forged documents" 
concerning the activities of Sudanese communists with a view 
to providing arguments for their murderers. (Cairo's Al-Akhbar

on the 27th published Mahjub's "confession" to an-Numayri 
before his trial.) Marchais added that on 27 July the PCP 
made its views known to "the ASU aairman in Cairo"--as-Sadat--
and asked him "finally to act" to prevent new crimes in Sudan. 
In his L'HUMANITE interview, SCP leader Mir claimed that 
an-Numayri would have been unable to regain power without 
"foreign intervention," which he cia3*. was decided during 
a conference in Tripoli, Libya, atteLe-wd by unnamed Libyan 
leaders, UAR War Minister Sadiq, and Sudanese Treasury Minister 
Abd al-Halim. He charged that the Egyptian army radio was 
used by Sudanese Defense Minister Hasan Abbas in the operation 
to restore an-Numayri, and that Egyptian planes landed 
Sud.knese troops which had been stationed at the Suez Canal.

GERMANY 
GDR DETAILS OFFER TO SENAT: TASS EDITS NEUES DEUTSCHLAND ITEM 
Against the background of publicly acknowledged progress 
in the four-power negotiations on Berlin and Western 
press discussion of confidential documents from the 
negotiations, East Berlin's SED party organ NEUES DEUTSCHLAND 
on 31 July publicizes details of the GDR proposals made 
to the West Berlin Senat at the ongoing talks between 
GDR State Secretary Kohrt and Senat Director Mueller. 
The details of these proposals have not been discussed 
previously by East German media on their own authority 
except for a 13 March NEUES DEUTSCHLAND article that 
outlined the proposals through the device of quoting a 
West Berlin TAGESSPIEGEL report.* The 31 July editorial 
strongly criticizes the Springer and CDU/CSU press and 
other west German mass media -- especially the 28 July 
issue of the weekly QUICK -- for revealing confidential 
details of the quadripartite talks on "West Berlin." 
Affirming that it is the GDR's desire to normalize 
relations "between West Berlin and the GDR," the editorial 
repeats the standard GDR call for success in the talks 
and noted that the GDR has submitted proposals to the 
West Berlin Senat. It immediately goes on to note that 
both sides "must show good will, and that includes 
recognition of the reality that West Berlin is a city 
with a specific political status and that it has never 
belonged to the Federal Republic and never will." A 
lengthy 1 August TASS summary of the editoria: includes 
this comment. 
Comparison of the details of the proposals as publicized 
in the March article with those in the current editorial 
indicates several changes. Where both articles noted 
there could be up to six visits of one- or two-day 
periods or once a year for up to 30 days for West Berliners 
to travel to "the GDR and its capital Berlin," the editorial 
adds that travelers will need a West Berlin identity 
paper and a GDR entry and exit visa. The March article,

in discussing the concessions due from West Berlin, cited 
TAGESSPIEGEL to the effect that the Senat "would have to 
accept" the most important GDR demands: "The Berlin Senat 
would. have to act Jike the government of an independent state"; 
it would also "have to recognize the affiliation of East Berlin 
with the GDR"; and it "should assume the obligation to prevent 
political activities in West Berlin which have scandalized the 
GDR for a long time." NEUES DEUTSCHLAND went on to note that 
the West Berlin paper interpreted the last condition to signify 
"the Federal presence" in West Berlin, an issue on which the 
Big Four were then "conducting negotiations." 
Without explicitly listing any "conditions" the Senat must meet, 
the editorial now declares tnat the "West Berlin Senat would only 
have to guarantee orderly arianngements for the visitors' traffic 
and spare West Berlin unnecessary complications"--an apparent 
allusion to Federal Government activities in West Berlir. 
The TASS report on the editorial furnishes no details of the GDR 
proporals to the Senat, but simply notes the editorial's claim 
that the GDR had made a "generous offer." With similar 
circumspection, TASS failed to summarize portions of the editorial 
which explained that the GDR had offered a treaty on regulating 
transit traffic between West Berlin and the FRG and which noted 
that "sealing of carriers transporting civilian goods is being 
considered"--a reference either to the FRG-GDR talks between 
State Secretaries Bahr and Kohl or to the Big Four talks. 
TASS also ignored the passage in the editorial pointing out that 
the problems of "enclaves such as Steinstuecken could be solved by 
a contractually arranged exchange of territory with the West Berlin 
Senat"--another topic within the mandate of the four-power 
negotiations. 
RESPONSIBILITY (113 August NEUES DEUTSCHLAND again denounced certain 
FOR LEAKS West German papers for publicizing out-of-context 
and distorted documents from the confidential 
negotiations. The article went on to charge that such documents could 
not have been made public "without the knowledge and the direct or 
indirect support of individual participants in the four-power 
negotiations." TASS reported this charge in its summary of the 
article. 
The only original Moscow comment on publicEtion of the documents 
in the West German press, in a Radio Peace and Progress broadcast to

supporters in FRG Government offices are responsible for 
the leaks.

note of the detailed report in the 2 August New York TIMES 
on the preaent state of the four-power negotiations.
