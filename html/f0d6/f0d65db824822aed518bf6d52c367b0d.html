FAR EAST 
Cambodia: Drive to Kompong Thom Still Stalled 
Late last week government troops inching 
their way overland toward Kompong Thom city 
finally reoccupied the village of Tang Kouk, 
where their advance had been checked by enemy 
elements for over two weeks. The Communists 
offered little resistance, as the bulk of their forces 
in and near the village apparently had withdrawn 
earlier to the northeast, possibly to their base in 
the nearby Chamcar Andong rubber plantation. 
The Cambodian Army column on Route 6 
has reached elephantine proportions, now consis-
ting of 20 battalions. The Communists' failure to 
make any heavy attacks on this inviting target 
perhaps may be partially due to the threat of air 
strikes. In any case, the enemy has successfully

VIETNAM 
tied down large numbers of government troops 
since 7 September with a minimum of effort and 
in doing so has drawn more public attention to 
Cambodian military deficiencies. 
It remains to be seen how much longer 
Phnom Penh will continue this operation, which 
is still 35 miles short of its goal. The column's 
commander has already told the press that the 
push north may be abandoned because Kompong 
Thom can now be resupplied by boat. Although 
some lead elements from the column did venture 
beyond Tang Kouk, most of the government 
troops were busy "reorganizing and consolidat-
ing" their positions around the village until a 
three-day religious holiday brought all activity to 
a full stop. Civic action personnel from Phnom 
Penh have also been indoctrinating villagers freed 
from enemy control. If the government task force 
does resume its advance, it can expect to meet 
with more determined Communist resistance. 
A third river convoy reached Kompong 
Thom during the week, meeting only token en-
emy harassment en route. It delivered another 
battalion of fresh troops and a heavy artillery 
battery. Communist propagandists near the city 
have been telling villagers they will attack it soon, 
once they are reinforced and have installed anti-
aircraft defenses. 
The Communists continued to carry out 
light harassing attacks and ambushes on govern-
ment positions and lines of communication. The 
most significant action was directed against two 
of the country's most vital roads, Routes 4 and 5. 
Traffic on Route 4 has been subjected to 
harassment recently

On Route 5, which connects Phnom Penh 
with rice-rich Battambang Province, one Commu-
nist ambush resulted in the death of the Battam-
bang Province police chief. This incident and 
other recent attacks within 20 miles of Battam-
bang city have heightened local apprehensions 
over the possibility of Communist attacks even 
closer to the city. Battambang reportedly has 
assumed the appearance of an armed camp, and 
its residents have initiated a number of local de-
fense measures. Regular government forces in the 
province are green and poorly armed, and prob-
ably not capable of withstanding the increased 
Communist pressure that is likely to come as the 
harvest season approaches.  
* � � 
Vietnam: More Communist Troops Head South 
Communists Plan New Action 
Communist forces in South Vietnam are 
trying to mount relatively small-scale attacks in 
widely separated parts of the country. They ap-
parently hope to demonstrate their ability to 
strike key targets at a time when they seem to be 
faltering in their efforts to shake the confidence 
of the government's territorial security forces and 
disrupt pacification. 
Many signs point to early October as the 
period for the next round of attacks, but enemy 
timetables often slip, and some units have already 
been delayed in their combat preparations. Plan-
ning for attacks is concentrated mainly in the 
northern half of South Vietnam, although some 
units in the delta provinces could also participate 
on a limited basis. The biggest threat is in Quang 
Fri and western Thua Thien provinces where sev-
eral North Vietnamese regiments are located near 
the South Vietnamese artillery position at fire 
support base O'Reilly. Most of the expected ac-
tion in other areas will probably consist of shell-
ings, harassment, and terrorism conducted by 
local force and guerrilla units. Since Sihanouk's 
ouster in Cambodia last March, the immediate 
enemy main force threat to the provinces that 
ring Saigon has been all but eliminated and the 
enemy's large-unit potential in the delta has been 
severely curtailed. 
Madame Binh Aims for Doves 
Military ambitions aside, the Communists 
have undertaken a considerable effort on the po-
litical plane to depict themselves as a force for 
peace. This is the main thrust of new evidence as 
to how the Communists plan to exploit the Viet 
Cong's eight-point proposal. A party directive 
drafted in late August and passed on to cadre 
earlier this month leaves the clear impression that 
Madame Binh's initiative is aimed in part at 
energizing peace movements in South Vietnam 
and abroad. The Communist "diplomatic offen-
sive," it says, is designed to trigger a rise in 
antiwar activities in the United States, but the 
directive makes much more of the effort that is to 
be directed against the Thieu government. It or-
ders the Communists to win over South Viet-
namese "middle classes, religious groups, intel-
ligentsia and the bourgeoisie" through an appeal 
to their peace instincts. By convincing people that 
only the ouster of the present Saigon regime and 
the withdrawal of US forces stand ir the way of 
peace, the directive asserts the Communists will 
pave the way for the rise of a "third force" that 
will come to terms with them. The directive or-
ders the entire Communist apparatus in Vietnam 
to be mobilized in support of this effort. 
The extraordinary amount of background 
material on the Viet C:ong proposal now being 
Page 2 WEEKLY SUMMARY 2 Oct 70 
Approved for Release: 2023/03/28 C03154565 
Approved for Release: 2023/03/28 C03154565 
passed to Communist troops in the field suggests 
other steps will be taken to support this "diplo-
matic offensive." By itself, Madame Binh's initia-
tive seems modest indeed; yet the Communists 
are making a real effort to assure their troops that 
basic Communist positions are unchanged and are 
warning that much fighting, and not peace, lies 
ahead. 
The directive does seem to contain a hint or 
two that the Communists are not locked in to all 
the language used by Madame Binh. There is a 
suggestion, for example, that the Communist po-
sition on a complete US pullout has some flexi-
bility. 
Peace Advocates Return 
Communist efforts to stir up peace senti-
ment come at a time when Lower House deputy 
Ngo Cong Duc, whose peace plan provoked the 
latest furor, has returned from Paris to defend his 
views. While in France, Duc elaborated on his plan 
calling for the participation in the Paris talks of a 
fifth delegation composed of South Vietnamese 
doves. His proposals have been denounced by 
many moderate and hard-line Vietnamese politi-
cal figures, and large protest demonstrations 
against Duc have been staged in several provincial 
capitals. Another dovish deputy, Pham The Truc, 
who issued controversial antigovernment state-
ments while in Japan last year and who has stayed 
out of the country since then, reportedly is also 
preparing to come back to Saigon. 
The return of these deputies will add to the 
unsettled political atmosphere, particularly if 
President Thieu pushes hard for the legislature to 
take action against them. Thieu called on the 
Lower House to move against Truc last year and 
he has now charged that Duc's proposal is no 
different from the Communist position. A new 
government initiative to force action against the 
deputies could create considerable executive-legis-
lative friction, as it did in the Tran Ngoc Chau 
case last winter. The Lower House is considering a 
petition for Duc's expulsion, but it seems doubt-
ful that it will receive the necessary two-thirds 
vote unless the government intervenes di-
rectly.

Communist China: China: Refurbishing the Bureaucracy 
Peking is moving forward in its efforts to 
normalize the central government apparatus even 
though several controversial policy and staffing 
problems probably remain unresolved. Last 
month the regime announced its intention to hold 
a National People's Congress (NPC), which is ex-
pected to serve as a forum for unveiling the new 
mechanism. It is uncertain how many loose ends 
the regime will attempt to tie up before con-
vening the long-delayed congress, but the return 
to duty of a growing number of senior civilian 
bureaucrats and other signs of a reversion to con-
ventional operations suggest that much of the 
groundwork for governmental reconstruction has 
already been laid. 
In most ministries, the principal decision-
making authority still appears to rest with mili-
tary commissions that assumed control early in 
the Cultural Revolution. At least one civilian min-
ister has been designated, however, and over the 
past few months more than a dozen veteran of-
ficials have been identified as vice ministers or 
department heads in both domestic and foreign 
affairs areas. Only last week, Peking called at-
tention to the reinstatement of four more vice 
ministers who had served in the textile, agri-
cultural machinery, petroleum, and industrial 
machinery ministries until their eclipse during the 
Cultural Revolution. 
The reappearance of such senior bureaucrats 
suggests that many day-to-clay operational respon� 
-
sibilities are being turned back to civilian experts. 
An increase in civilian responsibilities may 
also be taking place at the lower echelons; several 
recently received letters disclose that a variety of 
administrative and professional experts who had 
been sent to rural areas for labor reform are now 
being recalled to Peking because of "work re-
quirements." 
In addition to progress on staffing, there 
have been a number of other indications since last 
summer that Peking has been giving considerable 
attention to the work of the central ministries. 
Propaganda has implied that a number of min-
istries have been holding nationwide working con-
ferences and planning sessions. That the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs appears to be functioning ef-
ficiently is evidenced by the increasing activity of 
its regional department heads and the continued 
posting of ambassadors, including two last week 
to East Germany and Somalia. 
Peking is continuing its efforts to con-
solidate and streamline much of Hs top-heavy 
bureaucracy, and several ministries apparently 
have been merged. As a result, the NPC may 
reveal a government machinery considerably 
pared down from the 40 ministries that existed 
before the Cultural Revolution, although the cur-
rent proliferation of vice ministers suggests the 
regime may not have succeeded in defying Park-
inson's Law.

Thailand: A Period of Transition 
After almost seven years of unimaginative 
but steady leadership, Prime Minister Thanom is 
now clearly on the way out. The maneuvering to 
succeed him and reshape the way Thailand is 
governed, however, has yet to begin in earnest. 
Thanom has become a casualty of his own 
style of leadership and of problems at home and 
abroad over which he, or any Thai prime minister, 
has only limited control. Although Thanom's 
self-effacement was ideally suited to the sort of 
collective rule by which Thailand has been gov-
erned since Marshal Sarit's death in 1963, there is 
a growing feeling that it is not appropriate for the 
tough decisions that the country now faces. In its 
handling of highly controversial legislation�the 
tax bill, the budget, the proposed press act--the 
government has been divided and indecisive. Not 
only has Thanom been unable to whip his politi-
cal opponents in the parliament into line, but 
divisions within the government's own ranks have 
grown sharper, more rancorous, and unresponsive 
to the prime minister's leadership. In addition, 
the public display of differences among top lead-
ers over policy toward Cambodia has not only 
hardened existing divisions within the leadership 
but has further undermined public confidence in 
the government's ability to act forcefully and 
decisively on an issue of grave national concern. 
Thanom himself has grown increasingly 
weary of the political wars engulfing his admin-
istration; he has promised to give up his post as 
supreme commander of the Thai armed forces 
when he reaches the normal retirement age of 60 
in October 1971. This would also appear to be a 
logical time for him to retire from the premier-
ship as well, but strong counterforces�the loyalty 
of all of the armed forces and police and, most 
importantly, the monarchy�could suffice to keep 
Thanom in office until the next elections sched-
uled in early 1973 when he has publicly promised 
to step down. 
If Thanom leaves office early, as seems in-
creasingly likely, leadership would almost cer-
tainly pass on to Deputy Prime Minister Praphat, 
long the single most powerful figure in the gov-
ernment. With an exaggerated reputation for 
venality and conservatism, Praphat's ascension 
would be opposed by many elements of Thai 
society�including the monarchy and its sup-
porters. His recent announcement that he is 
resigning from all commercial positions should 
help mollify some but will not win over his major 
opponents. These elements would see Praphat's 
elevation as signaling a retreat from the goal of a 
constitutional government with representative 
institutions. There is, however, no evidence that 
Praphat himself is maneuvering to hasten 
Thanom's exit, but many of his supporters in the 
army and in the civilian bureaucracy are eagerly 
looking ahead to the day of change.  r

Japan Turns to the US for Aid on Space Program 
Japan has recently decided to forgo its "do 
it yourself" space booster program in favor of 
obtaining the required technology and equipment 
from outside sources, primarily the US. This de-
cision probably will be reinforced by failure of an 
attempt to orbit Japan's first scientific data col-
lecting satellite on 25 September. 
Up to now, Japan's space program has relied 
on two boosters of native design, the Lambda and 
the Mu, developed by Tokyo University scientists. 
The Lambda was used to place Japan's first 
satellite�a small one not designed to collect in-
formation�into orbit last February. The Lambda

program was plagued by separation and ignition 
problems, but Tokyo University scientists finally 
overcame these problems after four launch at-
tempts had failed. 
[he Mu is a larger launch vehicle having four 
solid-propellant stages as well as eight strap-on, 
solid-propellant boosters. The launch attempt oa 
25 September was the first firing of the complete 
Mu space launch vehicle and was unsuccessful 
because the fourth stage failed to ignite. Tokyo 
University scientists probably will try again to 
launch the Mu in January, 
Meanwhile, Japan's National Space Develop-
ment Agency has been designing larger launch 
vehicles as follow-ons to the Mu rocket. This 
group had planned to develop two progressively

larger and more powerful launch vehicles, de-
signated the Q and the N. Under present plans, 
however, the Q�an all-Japanese design�will be 
limited to testing purposes, and only the N will be 
used operationally. Furthermore, to shorten the 
development time and increase the payload of the 
N booster Japan has decided to forgo its own 
development of a new first stage for the N and 
will rely instead on the US Thor-Delta rocket for 
this purpose. The other two stages will be de-
signed and built in Japan. 
As plans now stand, Japan will acquire two 
or three Thor-Deltas from the US and hopes to 
arrange for licensed production in Japan. There 
will be eight launches of the N vehicle beginning 
in 1975 to place communications and scientific 
satellites into orbit.

vvard Europe and the Middle East have tended to

with the Asian states on the periphery of China. 
That an intensive Soviet courtship of these states 
is under way, however, is evident in Soviet trips 
abroad and especially in the steady stream of 
Asian visitors to Moscow in recent months_ 
One of the consequences of last year's 
clashes on the Sino-Soviet border was the new 
impetus given Moscow's drive to win friends and 
influence in Asia. Almost immediately after the 
incidents, Premier Kosygin visited India, Pakistan, 
and Afghanistan; President Podgorny went to 
Mongolia and North Korea; and lesser Soviet of-
ficials traveled to Burma, Cambodia, Laos, 
(b)(3) 
Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and 
Japan. 
The visits seemed motivated primarily by 
Moscow's desire to gain acceptance for the Soviet 
version of what had happened on the Ussuri 
River. The subsequent recall of all the USSR's 
ambassadors in Asia for a general policy review, 
coupled with Brezhnev's "proposal" for a system 
of collective security in Asia, suggested that the 
Soviets had embarked upon a new effort to in-
crease their influence. 
Brezhnev's proposal, couched in general 
terms, evoked a great deal of curiosity and also 
much skepticism. No detailed elaboration of the 
proposal was ever given and Moscow, after taking

soundings from Asian leaders, apparently con-
cluded that, for the time being at least, it was 
wiser to concentrate on bilateral paths of trade 
and diplomacy. 
Since last September, when Japanese For-
eign Minister Aichi made his first official visit to 
the USSR, there has been a virtual parade of 
Asian visitors to the USSR. Aichi was followed by 
Prince Sihanouk in March, and in April leading 
officials from the Asian Communist countries (Le 
Duan from North Vietnam, Tsedenbal from 
Mongolia, and Choe Yong Kon from North 
Korea) went to Moscow for the Lenin Centenary 
celebrations. 
They in turn were followed by Pakistani 
President Yahya and Australian Deputy Prime 
Minister McEwen in June, Malaysian Prime Min-
ister Tunku Abdul Rahman in July, and Indo-
nesian Foreign Minister Malik and Afghan Prime 
Minister Etemadi in August. September was the 
busiest month of all. Singapore's Prime Minister 
Lee Kuan Yew and Indian President Gin i both 
made lengthy state visits to the USSR, and 
Afghanistan's King and Queen also stopped off 
for a two-day "unofficial" visit. 
Moscow has clearly derived benefit from 
some of these visits; others have not been so 
successful. Developments in Cambodia over which 
the Soviets had almost no control, for example, 
have placed strains on the USSR's relations with 
Hanoi that talks in Moscow were not able to 
overcome. On the other hand, Indonesian Foreign 
Minister Malik's visit resolved the debt-repayment 
question that had been clouding Soviet-
Indonesian relations for years. The Soviets rec-
ognize, however, that diplomatic efforts will take 
time. Consequently, Moscow is probably not too 
discouraged by its lack of progress thus far and 
will probably continue to encourage close and 
frequent contacts with Asian leaders.

USSR: Recent Appointments Spell Status Quo 
Party boss Brezhnev has been increasingly 
active in domestic and foreign policy affairs in 
recent months and the extensive publicity ac-
corded him has further underscored his pre-
eminence within the leadership. The pattern of 
recent personnel assignments suggests, however, 
that he has not measurably increased his author-
ity in this vital political area and that collective 
decision-making still prevails. 
Appointees to several important regional 
party posts have all been relatively obscure local 
officials who have made their way up through the 
local party organization. None has any visibly 
close contacts in the politburo. Although this 
pattern in part reflects a conscious party effort to 
work out a more orderly "career development" 
policy in the wake of Khrushchev's arbitrary ap-
proach, it also reflects the fact that no one mem-
ber of the politburo has gained the upper hand in 
cadre matters. Brezhnev has been able gradually 
to eliminate followers of his political rival 
Shelepin, but he apparently has not exercised 
more than a veto in the selection of their replace-
ments. 
The recent change in the leadership of the 
Leningrad party organization has reflected this 
situation. There are a few tentative indications 
that the political sympathies of former Leningrad 
party boss Tolstikov, who was confirmed as am-
bassador to Peking in mid-September, lie with 
Shelepin. In any event, he is clearly no supporter 
of Brezhnev, and his exile to Peking is a gain for 
the General Secretary. Tolstikov was succeeded in 
the key Leningrad post, however, by his long-time 
deputy and presumed protege, Grigory Romanov. 
The 47-year-old Romanov is little known 
outside of Leningrad. He has spent his entire

career there and has served as second secretary of 
the oblast party committee since 1963. Similarly 
obscure local officials were selected to head the 
party organizations in Chelyabinsk Oblast and 
Khabarovsk Kray during the summer. These shifts 
were obviously made with an eye to the up-
coming party congress next March, when both 
men can expect to be elected to the central com-
mittee. Romanov is already a member. Because o' 
the importance of the Leningrad party post, he 
should eventually gain a seat on the politburo as a 
candidate member. Tolstik.ov was the only head 
of the Leningrad organization in recent years who 
failed to achieve this rank. 
The Leningrad shift was presided over by 
party secretary Suslov. His presence underscored 
both the importance of the Leningrad post and 
his own position in the leadership. It also pro-
vided additional evidence that Brezhnev did not 
have a free hand in the selection of the party boss 
in this oblast, whose allegiance has historically 
been especially important to the head of the 
party. 
Since Brezhnev became party boss he has 
publicly presided over two personnel changes 
elsewhere. In both cases his presence was a clear 
display of his personal involvement in the matter. 
The first and most notable time was at the rein-
statement of his protege Kunayev as Kazakh 
party boss immediately after Khrushchev's ouster. 
Brezhnev has not publicly demonstrated this 
authority in cadre matters for several years, how-
ever, which raises a question as to how firm his 
control of the new central committee will 
be.

SWEDEN: Final returns from the parliamentary

ruling Social Democratic Party's representation in

support to remain in office. The 350 seats in

Nixon's visit, to hear Tito and Kardelj speak on 
the subject. Thereafter, lesser party and gov-
ernment bodies on the republic level will be 
convened to discuss the topic. The reason for 
Tito's haste is not clear. As far as is known, he is 
not ill and does not intend to retire soon.I

parties together will have one-seat majorities on

visionist to New Left�does not promise smooth 
sailing for the Palnne government, despite its 
ostensible 10-seat  majority in combination with

Safeguards Problems Beset the IAEA 
The highlight of the annual conference of 
the 103 member states of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that ended this 
week was the adoption of an Italian proposal to 
amend the IAEA statute to expand the Board of 
Governors, the agency's executive entity, from 25 
to 35 members. Rome and Bonn would receive 
permanent seats on the board under terms of the 
amendment, which must be ratified by two thirds 
of the member states. 
The Soviets strongly opposed the Italian ini-
tiative and will probably launch a campaign to 
delay ratifications of the amendment until Italy 
and West Germany, both members of the Euro-
pean Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM), 
have ratified the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). 
Moscow maintains that states sitting on the board 
but not having fully accepted the treaty will seek 
to weaken the safeguards agreements that nonnu-
clear-weapon states or regional groupings must 
reach with the IAEA. Both Italy and West Ger-
many will delay their NPT ratifications until 
EURATOM has worked out a satisfactory agree-
ment with the IAEA, a lengthy process currently 
delayed even more by the refusal so far of France 
to join its five partners in drafting a negotiating 
mandate for EURATOM. 
France does not intend to sign the NPT and 
wants any IAEA-EURATOM agreement phrased 
in such a way as to protect its right as a nuclear 
power to refuse international inspection of its 
nuclear facilities. Several other states, those in the 
near - nuclear-weapon category, also have ex-
pressed concern that a comprehensive IAEA ver-
ification arrangement would have a strong indus-
trial espionage potential harmful to any techno-
logical advances they may make in peaceful ap-
plications of nuclear energy. 
The difficulties the IAEA faces in establish-
ing a viable safeguards system were most evident 
at the recent meeting of its working group look-
ing into the question of inspections. The US, with 
support from the UK and Hungary, argued pri-
marily for minimum restrictions on IAEA rights 
of access. Three near-nuclears�West Germany, 
Japan, and Sweden�favored inspection only at 
certain key points in the utilization of fissionable 
material. An accord was not reached  
(b)(1) 
(b)(3) 
Fifty-six nonnuclear-weapon states adhering 
to the NPT were to have begun safeguards nego-
tiations with the IAEA by 1 September under 
terms of Article 3 of the treaty. Only 16 have 
declared their readiness to enter into negotiations, 
and the IAEA's continuing inability to set its own 
house in order on the desired level of inspections 
hardly serves to induce a more forthcoming atti-
tude on the part of the 40 delinquents.

France: Government Labor Policy Succeeds 
Prospects for a peaceful labor scene this fall 
have been greatly enhanced by the Pompidou 
government's efforts to create a "new society." 
Premier Chaban-Delmas, architect of "La Grande 
Reforme," has introduced a number of innova-
tions that have satisfied major demands of labor 
leaders in the private and public sectors, thus 
reducing the possibility of large-scale strikes re-
sulting from social and economic tensions. Impor-
tant negotiations begun this week with the na-
tionalized railway workers will test whether in 
fact the unions are content for the present to

bargain around a conference table rather than in 
the streets. 
Earlier this month, Finance Minister Giscard 
D'Estaing completed a series of consultations 
with France's five major labor federations on gov-
ernment proposals for tax reform. These talks 
constituted one of the more significant reaffirma-
tions of the government's philosophy of consulta-
tion in the field of labor relations. One aim of the 
government in promoting consultation is to create 
a sense of participation on the part of the unions 
in the search for programs and actions commen-
surate with France's resources and progress.I  
 rthe labor leaders involved, in-
cluding Georges Seguy of the Communist-led 
General Confederation of Labor (CGT), have ex-
pressed satisfaction that their meetings with the 
Finance Minister have constituted a true dialogue, 
with a genuine give-and-take of ideas and argu-
ments on the regime's tax proposals. 
Nonetheless, some labor leaders are still ap-
prehensive and are following a "wait and see' 
policy. In an effort to discredit the government's 
actions, Seguy has announced that tax reform will 
be the theme of mass meetings the CGT will 
organize in October at the time the National 
Assembly debates the budget. 
In the past year, the government has made 
several other labor reforms. Blue-collar workers 
were transferred from hourly to monthly pay 
status and granted fringe benefits formerly en-
joyed only by white-collar workers, and workers 
who take vocational training to upgrade their 
skills are being given leave with full pay. Although 
the CGT has been reluctant, most unions have 
responded positively to the introduction of the 
"social contract," designed to give labor and man-
agement time to iron out disagreements. In return 
for a 90-day pledge not to strike, the unions are 
guaranteed wage adjustments linked to move-
ments in the GNP, worker productivity, and the 
general performance of the employing company. 
Other important reforms include the revision 
of the legal minimum wage with annual adjust-
ments, and the share-holding program for Renault 
workers, who, on the basis of seniority, are given 
rights to dividends and representation on manage-
ment councils. 
The successful introduction and implementa-
tion of these reforms and the impressive Gaullist 
parliamentary victory in Bordeaux last week indi-
cate that Chaban-Delmas' "new society" is work-
ing.

INTERNATIONAL AVIATION: Toward week's

vote for adoption, and 10 seemed certain to do 
so. France appeared reluctant to oppose the US 
draft openly and reportedly was seeking sufficient 
abstentions to deny the US a majority of council 
ballots. Complicating the prospects for the US 
draft were less stringent Canadian and Japanese 
alternaticie proposals that may be more palatable 
to a number of countries concerned about the 
economic effect of an air services boycott.

MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA 
Egypt: Nasir Passes from the Scene 
President Nasir's death following a heart at-
tack on 28 September leaves Egypt and the Arab 
world with no single leader of comparable stature. 
Nasir's loss will be sorely felt in Egypt, 
where there is no obvious permanent successor. 
According to constitutional law, Vice President 
Anwar Sadat has been appointed interim presi-
dent, and a new president is to be selected within 
60 days. Although Sadat may be selected to stay 
on as a figurehead chief of state, he is not thought 
to carry much weight in Egyptian political circles. 
He participated with Nasir in the revolution of 
1952 
If a figurehead president is chosen for the 
short term, the decision-making will probably be 
left in the hands of the group of advisers who 
constituted Nasir's inner circle. Included in this 
group are Minister of State Sami Sharaf, who has 
also been chief of presidential intelligence; Min-
ister of National Guidance Muhammad Haykal; 
Minister of Interior Sharawi Jumah; and possibly 
Amin Huwaydi, who is currently a minister of 
state but until recently was chief of general intel-
ligence. There seems to have been some rivalry 
among these men and, 
although they all ap-
peared to share a com-
mon loyalty to Nasir, it 
is not clear whether or 
for how long they will 
set aside their differ-
ences in order to pre-
serve the political sta-
bility that Egypt has 
enjoyed since the early 
1950s. 
President Nasir 
The active military 
leadership cannot be 
ignored in this period of 
transition, however, and whoever eventually 
emerges on top will need at least the tacit blessing 
of the armed forces. Muhammad Fawzi, the com-
mander in chief of the armed forces and the 
minister of war, is not believed to have any par-
ticular political ambitions for himself, but his 
influence with the military will be important in 
determining whom they support. Other generals 
may also hope to play a role in post-Nasir Egypt. 
There are also a number of civilians who 
either hold positions of some influence now or 
have held important posts in the past who could 
be involved in the political maneuvering that is 
reportedly already taking place. This group in-
cludes such figures as former vice president 
Zakariya Muhyeddin; member of the executive 
council of Egypt's sole legal political organization 
All Sabri; and such former members of Nasir's 
"free officer" group as Abd al-Latif Baghdadi. 
The final outcome of this period of flux cannot 
be predicted, however, and some relatively ob-
scure figure could eventually emerge at the top�
even as Nasir himself did 
Israeli Reaction 
(b)(1) 
(b)(3) 
Israeli Arab-watchers expect military leaders 
to dominate any Egyptian regime. They believe 
that the new rulers will be so preoccupied with 
infighting and maintaining power, and so en-
grossed in domestic problems, that they will be 
ineffective either diplomatically or militarily.

They see no one of Nasir's stature emerging for 
years, and believe that individual Arab states will 
act with increasing independence of Cairo. They 
thus conclude that Nasir's death has set Arab 
nationalism back ten years and has probably 
slowed the Arabs' anti-Israeli drive. Israeli of-
ficials are also probably not unhappy that Nasir's 
death, combined with the upheavals in Jordan, 
has probably set back peace talks for some time. 
Other Effects of Nasir's Death 
I he Soviets will be gravely worried about 
their long-run position in Egypt. They will p ay 
their cards in a fashion calculated to protect their 
stake, subordinating short-run concerns to their 
effort to find and back a new leadership that 
promises to be of enduring value to Soviet in-
terests. 
Jordan: The Crisis Ebbs 
Most Arab leaders are likely to maintain a 
respectful silence on the succession question until 
the dust has settled, but the centrifugal forces in 
the Middle East will be accelerated without 
Nasir's stabilizing influence. The other Arab lead-
ers are either too preoccupied with their own 
problems, or of too little influence, to be serious 
contenders for a leadership role. 
Nasir's death seriously complicates Middle 
East peace efforts, but its precise effect may not 
be clear for some time. At least at the outset, the 
new Egyptian leadership will probably be preoc-
cupied with domestic political concerns and will 
not be eager�or perhaps able�to explore new 
approaches to the Arab-Israeli problem. Even if 
they were, they do not command Nasir's author-
ity in Egypt or in the Arab world and would have 
trouble making any agreement stic:k 
� � � 
Thursday morning, army units and truck-
loads of fedayeen began moving out of Amman, 
bringing to a close the latest round in the con-
tinuing Bedouin-Palestinian hostilities. Egyptian 
President Nasir was the principal architect of the 
present settlement, which was agreed to last 
weekend in Cairo by King Husayn and Yasir 
Arafat, Despite Nasir's sudden death, the frag le 
armistice still managed to pass beyond the init'al 
stages of implementation under the close super-
vision of military observers from the major Arab 
states. 
As in past settlements, both sides can claim 
victory. The fedayeen were never dislodged from 
large sections of Amman and still hold parts of 
northern Jordan. The army has had the satisfac-
tion of a showdown with the despised irregulars 
and, if its performance in Amman was less than 
decisive, it covered itself with glory by repulsing 
(b)(3) 
the Syrian invasion. Even if the terms of the 
settlement are fully carried out, however, further 
army-fedayeen clashes seem inevitable. Senior 
army leaders are likely to be grudging in their 
acceptance, and casual contacts between Bedouin 
soldiers and commandos could again erupt into 
shooting. Much still depends on the attitude and 
leadership of Yasir Arafat, and on the King's 
desire and ability to keep the army in check. 
The agreement signed in Cairo and endorsed 
by Arab chiefs of state on 27 September differed 
little from previous government-fedayeen com-
pacts, but it did provide for enforcement by the 
other Arab states and this has been the key to its 
successful implementation so far. If necessary, 
both sides can justify their acceptance despite 
previously adamant rejections by terming it an 
imposed settlement.

The process of cleaning up the capital has 
begun, but at least ten days will be required to 
restore a modicum of water and power supplies. 
Food stocks are beginning to pour in, but the 
volume so far is inadequate fully to meet the 
need. Earlier casualty estimates have been scaled 
down, and it is now believed that the number of 
dead in Amman will probably not exceed 1,000. 
Emergency hospitals, including two flown in by 
the US, are operating around the clock. 
Fedayeen units in the north appear to have 
spent the early days of the cease-fire con-
solidating and extending their hold on lrbid, 
Ramtha, and other cities and towns. As a result of 
fighting that continued sporadically as late as 30 
September, the army may have succeeded in cut-
ting the road between Ramtha and the Syrian 
border. By noon Thursday, however, press 
sources indicated that guerrillas and army officers 
had signed an agreement to restore peace to the 
north and that army tanks had pulled away from 
the Ramtha road. 
The proximate cause of the latest conflict, 
the seizure of foreign hostages by the PFLP, was 
finally resolved when the last six airline passen-
gers were released on 29 September. None had 
been harmed, and most remarked favorably on 
the treatment they had received. The next day, 
the seven guerrillas held in Switzerland, West Ger-
many, and the UK were released and flown to 
Cairo. 
Israel Sees Balm in Gilead 
Israeli officials have issued a whole series of 
warnings to Jordan and the fedayeen, threatening 
a strong Israeli military response if the guerrillas 
concentrate in northern Jordan and begin to 
harass Israeli settlements in the Beit Shean valley 
across the border. The warnings and threats sug-
gest that, given a justifiable opportunity, Israel 
may be thinking of moving across the Jordan 
River to clean out and perhaps to hold the Gilead 
Heights. In this regard, General Bar-Lev, the Is-
raeli chief of staff, warned of military actions 
"different in scope and character" than previous 
strikes against the fedayeen. Moreover, Deputy 
Prime Minister Allon noted that Israel has the 
means "to ensure that the Jordan valley and the 
Beit Shean settlements will not again be easy 
targets for the Jordanian Army and terrorist or-
ganizations." The Israelis have nevertheless scaled 
down their build-up opposite north Jordan, al-
though there has been no evidence that the re-
serve units mobilized during the crisis have been 
released. 
PFLP to go Underground 
The PFLP, which was responsible in large 
measure for bringing on the recent disorders, has 
decided to become an underground terrorist or-
ganization targeted against "reactionary" Arab 
states as well as Western interests. The extremist 
fedayeen group is convinced that the Palestine 
Liberation Organization and certain "reactionary 
countries"�Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and 
the Persian Gulf states�are "maneuvering" 
against it. The PFLP believes that as a result of its 
activities over the past three years, the organiza-
tion has established the sort of reputation it needs 
to make converts to its cause. Eventually, it hopes 
to lead an uprising of the Arab masses, a goal of 
its parent organization, the now-defunct Arab Na-
tionalist Movement (ANM). The ANM had 
branches throughout the Arab world prior to the 
June 1967 war, and the PFLP may be hopin to 
reactivate this old apparatus.

Chad: Insurgency Respite 
President Tombalbaye's government, with 
French help, has won a battlefield respite in its 
five-year struggle against Muslim insurgents. Con-
comitant administrative measures, however, have 
not yielded the improvements and socioeconomic 
services necessary to eliminate the underlying 
causes of discontent. 
The insurgency sterns from the Muslims' his-
toric ethnic conflict with the non-Muslim south-
erners who now rule the country, but it has been 
enflamed by poor local administration and unjust 
taxation. At the request of the weary Torn-
balbaye regime, France intervened a year and a 
half ago on the condition that sweeping reforms 
be undertaken. 
At the moment, the military situation ap-
pears well in hand. There has been no serious 
dissident activity since last April, and the rainy 
season now ending has not seen the usual re-
surgence of widespread raids in central-eastern 
Chad. Instead, several important insurgent leaders 
from the central area have initiated an informal 
cease-fire preparatory to engaging in peace talks 
early this month. The rebels in this region seem-
ingly are in greater disarray than those in the east 
and north, where sporadic incidents are more 
common. 
Tombalbaye has helped contain the insur-
gency by developing closer ties with his Arab 
neighbors. The insurgents have not received aid 
from Sudan or Libya, and their self-styled leader 
in exile has been barred from both countries. 
Also, Khartoum has promised a greater effort to 
interdict rebels seeking sanctuary. 
French combat troops are being gradually 
pulled out, with mid-1971 as the completion 
date. An expanded advisory element will remain 
for several years to assist in administrative reform 
and to complete the retraining of the Chadian 
military. Chad's French-led forces, aided by the 
permanent French intervention force at Fort 
Lamy, supposedly will be ready to assume the 
defense burden by next year. 
Unless Chad fohows up its military gains 
with administrative remedies and a political settle-
ment, however, dissidence will probably continue

and could again reach dangerous proportions,

Congo (Kinshasa): Bad News for Brussels 
Two years of relatively good relations be-
tween the Congo and Belgium recently came to 
an end when Kinshasa announced several eco-
nomic changes that disturbed Brussels, and the 
Congolese press assumed an anti-Belgian tone. 
Belgian officials have voiced their concern to the 
US. 
Kinshasa made two announcements affecting 
Belgian corporations operating in the Congo in 
mid-September. One was a decision to award two 
mining concessions in Katanga to an American-led 
consortium rather than to a Belgian-led one in-
cluding Union Miniere, the company that oper-
ated the Katanga copper mines until late 1966. 
Various political and economic considerations 
entered into the decision, but, in the final analy-
sis, Mobutu apparently decided that he did not 
want Union Miniere to return to the Congo, even 
on a small scale. 
Secondly, a decision was made to place all 
subsidiaries of Cominiere�a large Belgian com-
pany that operates most of the Congo's public 
utilities�under the Ministry of National Econ-
omy. Officials in Cominiere are currently engaged 
in internal legal wranglings, and the Minister of 
National Economy claims the action was taken to 
prevent a deterioration of Cominiere's services 
while the legal maneuvering is going on. 
Although these two decisions were not re-
lated, the Congolese Council of Ministers released 
a communiqu6 that linked them. The communi-
que was then reprinted by the local press with 
anti-Belgian overtones, a line it probably would 
not have taken without direction from or at least 
�the tacit approval of the President. Morever, 
Mobutu himself added fuel to the fire by making 
several anti-Belgian comments in his own 
speeches. 
Officials in Brussels�already nervous over 
Mobutu's recent demotion of National Bank Gov-
ernor Ndele, whom they believed to be the only 
Congolese with good financial judgment willing to 
speak up to Mobutu�reacted to these develop-
ments with concern. Belgians in the Congo, how-
ever, have remained calm, assuming that this, like 
similar incidents, will soon pass. 
It is unclear why Mobutu has taken this 
tactic when he is so eager to attract foreign invest-
ment into the Congo. Part of it is a lingering 
distrust of Union Miniere and Mobutu's personal 
ire over the attempts of one Belgian company to 
gain control of Cominiere. Of equal importance, 
however, may be the national elections to be held 
later this month and in November; Mobutu is well 
aware that standing up to the Belgians is always 
good politics.

WESTERN HEMISPHERE 
Dominican Opposition Crumbles 
Since his re-election last May, President 
Balaguer's political tactics have all but eliminated 
any effective opposition, and his opponents now 
seem resigned to another four years of his pater-
nalistic rule. The Communist left, which dis-
rupted the election campaign with numerous kill-
ings, is now on the defensive as a result of a 
persistent counterterrorism campaign by security 
forces_ Former president Juan Bosch's leftist 
Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD), virtually 
the only organized, large-scale opposition group, 
will probably be the object of increased harass-
ment. 
I he only two parties to attract a sizable 
share of the vote against Balaguer are in serious 
straits. The activities of the Anti- Re-election 
Democratic Integration Movement (MIDA) have 
practically ground to a halt, and party leaders 
retlect the group's despair by focusing not on the 
objective of building an effective opposition but 
on the hope that Balaguer will step down in 197L. 
MIDA, a breakaway faction from the President's 
Reformist Party, may find its ranks further 
thinned over the next several months as repentant 
Reformistas return to the fold. Former general 
Wessin's rightist party is faced with even more 
serious problems. Military supporters have des-
erted him for a chance to return to the active 
duty posts proffered by the administration, and a 
significant civilian segment of the party, 
  has 
bolted the organization and accepted government 
positions. 
I he President has dealt with the left in less 
subtle fashion. The security forces' campaign has 
been blatant, brutal, and effective. Several rank-
ing figures of the Dominican Popular Movement 
(MPD), the most active Communist faction, have 
been killed or jailed recently. This week, a party 
youth leader was arrested and murdered by 
police. The MPD, which was responsible for the 
kidnaping of the US air attache in March, may 
attempt some spectacular retaliatory act. 
  Most of its 
energies have been spent in a futile battle with 
Bosch for leadership of the left. Balaguer's strat-
egy has been to set factions of both the right and 
left to warring, and his opponents' naivete has 
r:ontributed to the success of his efforts_ 
Meanwhile, former president Bosch has con-
tinued the surprising, generally moderate policies 
he adopted on his return to the country early this 
year. Military leaders, who consider Bosch a Com-
munist and the greatest threat to Balaguer's care-
fully nurtured stability, are nonetheless con-
cerned. They fear that he is playing a waiting 
game, building a more moderate party image and 
hoping to enter the elections in 1974 rather than 
abstain as in this year's contest. 
Bosch is currently purging radicals from the 
party and has outlined plans for rebuilding labor 
support and for organizing peasant leagues. New 
initiatives in these sensitive areas�the rural 
population is the mainstay of Balaguer's electoral 
support, and leftist-tending unions have been 
tightly controlled�would probably elicit a strong 
government response. With other opposition 
camps in disarray, the armed forces will probably 
turn increasing attention to PRD activities. The 
military has already been using a fictitious right-
wing front to harass the party.

Terrorism on the Upswing in Guatemala 
The almost daily terrorist incidents in 
Guatemala over the past two weeks seem designed 
to provoke a repressive response from the govern-
ment that in turn might force the more cautious 
revolutionary" elements to join a campaign of 
armed violence. 
The two-month lull in terrorist activity 
ended in mid-September with dozens of bomb-
ings, assassinations of police officers and others, 
kidnapings, and scattered acts of sabotage. Disap-
pearances of university students have led to pro-
tests and accusations of government repression. 
Minister of Government Arenales has claimed 
publicly that the terrorism represents a "master 
plan" to force the gov nt to "de art from 
the margin of  the law." 
the urban contingent of the e e 
Armed Forces (FAR) is planning gradually to 
accelerate terrorism to a point where the govern-
ment will react in a heavy-handed manner, thus 
alienating the public. 
The resumption of terrorism comes in the 
wake of a confrontation between FAR com-
mander "Manzana" and dissidents embittered by 
inactivity, but it is unclear whether the new 
round of violence is the work solely of FAR 
splinter groups or whether it is the work of sev-
eral groups. 
The Communist Party (PGT), which believes 
it has growing assets in the quasi-legal sphere and 
therefore opposes the use of armed violence as 
the major revolutionary strategy, is seriously dis-
turbed over the recent increase in terrorism and 
alleged Cuban influence in the FAR. Because the 
PGT is more exposed than the FAR, its members 
are more vulnerable to a government crackdown. 
PGT leaders reportedly believe that the FAR 
wants to provoke the government into retaliating 
against the PGT because the party has refused to 
cooperate with the terrorists in several recent 
operations. More than likely, however, FAR 
activists want to prod the PGT into adopting an 
active policy of violence. 
The Arana government meanwhile is pur-
suing its crash program to upgrade the security 
forces, and it plans to activate soon a harder line 
against the insurgents. A new emergency law is 
now in draft and Congress is being asked to ap-
propriate $500,000 for an anti-insurgency and 
pacification program. The mobile military police 
reportedly will be replaced by a larger national 
guard to police the rural areas, and several of the 
now-independent and often rival police forces will 
probably be combined. The armed forces have 
been redeployed, new paratroop companies have 
been added, and the increased army presence in 
some rural areas has already slowed banditry and 
guerrilla violence. 
The lack of visible security success in 
Guatemala City, nevertheless, is raising questions 
as to why Arana is not implementing his promised 
imposition of law and order. The government 
evidently remains determined to act against ter-
rorism primarily through legal methods, but 
Minister of Government Arenales believes that in 
the face of the current security problem, the 
government soon must react severely if it is not to 
be confronted with the disaffection of right-wing 
civilians and some military supporters. The 
government is also concerned that the FAR will 
attempt a "spectacular" assassination, which 
would increa re on the 
government.

Peru: Discontent Growing in the Military 
Military disillusionment with the Velasc:o 
government has reached a higher point than at 
any time since the overthrow of President 
Belaunde two years ago. Opposition to such radi-
cal policies as the industrial reform law is partially 
responsible, but perhaps more important is the 
growing estrangement of officers who participate 
directly in the government from their nonpolitical 
colleagues in strictly military positions. 
The most recent outward sign of dissatisfac-
tion with the government's policies was the resig-
nation of Labor Minister General Chamot. 
Chamot has been instrumental in blocking official 
recognition of the Communist labor confedera-
tion despite pressure from some members of the 
government. His dismissal and the reorganization 
of the Labor Ministry have been among the list of 
demands in most Communist-led strikes of recent 
months. 
It was announced that Chamot resigned for 
personal reasons, but a strike of Communist-led 
workers that has paralyzed the mining industry 
may have increased the pressure on him. The 
Communist labor confederation was asked earlier 
by the Minister of Interior (who will temporarily 
fill the labor post) to play a leading role in the 
celebration of the Velasco government's second 
anniversary on 3 October. A 15-day suspension of 
the miners' strike was announced shortly after 
Chamot's resignation, indicating that he was 
forced out at this time to avoid any problems for 
the government on 3 October. Chamot's perma-
nent replacement will be the present air attache 
to Paris, General Pedro Sala Orosco, whose po-
litical attitudes are unknown. 
In order to fill some of the strategic posi-
tions expected to open up as a result of the 
personnel changes, President Velasco was forced 
to resort to issuing a special decree promoting 
officers he trusts. General Montagne, the minister 
of war who has opposed many of the govern-
ment's radical measures, previously had been suc-
cessful in keeping Velasco's favorites off the pro-
motion list. Most had not met the necessary 
requirements, and the President's action in over-
riding the list has angered many top military 
officers. 
General Jose Benavides, who is highly popu-
lar within the army and is a leading spokesman 
for the moderates, retired from active duty when 
he was passed over for promotion. Bitter over his 
treatment and disillusioned with Velasco's poli-
cies, Benavides could become the rallying point 
for other officers hoping to force changes in the 
government.

Ovando of Bolivia Completes First Year 
President Ovando celebrated his first an-
niversary in Bolivia's top office on 26 September, 
but had to overcome another political crisis in 
order to do so. Ovando has had to resort to crafty 
maneuvering and compromise to stay in office 
this long, and the very eve of his first anniversary 
was no exception. 
On 25 September there were widespread 
rumors that Ovando was either going to resign or 
be forced out of office. That something was afoot 
was suggested by meetings of top military officers 
on 23 September followed by a communique 
issued by a group of retired generals on the 24th 
cal ling for Ovando's removal and for new 
elections. 
Apparently, no time frame was set for the 
cabinet changes, but removal of the ministers 
would represent a further curbing of Ovando's 
power by the military. It is possible, however, 
that Ovando will continue to procrastinate�as he 
has in the past�or balance the removal of the 
leftists by dismissing a military minister such as 
Interior Minister Ayoroa. 
By making these promises, Ovando has 
weathered yet another serious political crisis. All 
of the participants in the Ovando-military struggle 
are still present, however, and there is nothing to 
suggest that any basic differences have been re-
solved. Thus, the conflict that has characterized 
Ovando's first year is assured for the second.

CUBA: By avoiding major issues in his speech on 
28 September, Fidel Castro did little to dispel the 
uncertainty that has characterized his leadership 
since the end of the sugar harvest. During his 
address marking the tenth anniversary of Cuba's 
neighborhood vigilance committees (CDRs), 
Castro repeated his theme of 26 July that the 
political development of the national youth, 
women, farmers, and labor organizations has been 
neglected, and promised that these groups would 
receive the attention they merited. He assumed 
full responsibility for the neglect, and, in an im-
plicit criticism of his own decision to concentrate 
on harvesting a record-breaking ten million tons 
of sugar in 1970, attributed his error to "a certain 
idealism." He again referred to a vague process by 
which the people, especially through the mass 
organizations, would exert greater control over 
production of goods and services, but he again 
failed to describe specifically how this control 
would be achieved. He made it clear, however, 
that repressive measures are being developed for 
use against workers guilty of "vagrancy, parasit-
ism, and absenteeism."

Ch i le: Allende Sees Clear Road to the Presidency 
Marxist Salvador Allende's growing confi-
dence that nothing stands between him and the 
presidency was demonstrated clearly this week. 
He refused to accept the specific list of 
-democratic guarantees" presented him by the 
country's largest party, the Christian Democrats 
(PDC), saying his long ''democratic vocation" is 
proof enough that guarantees are not needed. He 
added that the Chilean people are the real guaran-
tee of their democracy, and rejected outright the 
PDC request for assurance that as president he 
would not interfere with the armed forces. Al-
lende claimed that his respect for their profes-
sional role could not be questioned and that he 
would not relinquish even to his own coalit on 
the presidential prerogative of designating the 
high command of the military. 
Allende's adamancy is predicated on his cer-
tainty that a bloc of the PDC represented by 25 
legislators will vote for him on 24 October with-
out conditions. This will ensure confirmation of 
his slim electoral victory on 4 September. This 
bloc is led by defeated presidential candidate 
Radorniro Tomic, 
Divisions between leftists and moderates have 
wracked the PDC for years. One leftist faction 
bolted in 1969 and is now part of the Allende 
coalition. Tomic's group is sure to bring the mat-
ter to a head at the PDC national congress this 
weekend, shattering President Frei's recent efforts 
to unify the party. 
Ihe formerly close relationship between the 
PDC and the Roman Catholic Church in Chile has 
weakened considerably. Important elements of 
the left wing of the church have come out 
strongly for Allende, and on 24 September the 
Chilean Episcopate made a formal statement that 
in effect counsels "Christian acquiescence" to Al-
lende's plurality in the popular election. Father 
Roger Vekemans, a leading international church-
man who has lived in Chile and has played an 
active role in social reforms there for some years 
sees little hope of stopping Allende short of inter-
vention by the Chilean military, which he con-
siders highly problematical. The prospect of an 
Allende government has led Father Vekemans and 
his West German backers to transfer his social 
development organization (DESAL) to Caracas. 
Meanwhile, Allende's Popular Unity (UP) 
activists are following up their successful efforts 
to extend their control over most of the media 
and universities by taking quiet but effective con-
trol of union and professional organizations in 
virtually every significant enterprise and activity. 
They will then be in a position to influence labor 
negotiations and to facilitate Allende's reported 
plan to halt the exodus of managerial and tech-
nical personnel as soon as he takes office. 
With in the UP, the Communist Party 
(PCCH) has set up a 50-man commission of spe-
cialists to plan the execution of the coalition's 
program according to PCCH priorities. The com-
mission is working on the problem of how to 
implement the 40 popular "bread and butter" 
measures Allende promised to take as soon as 
possible, as well as on how fast and how extensive 
the nationalization of Chilean industries should 
be. PCCH studies are also being made on attract-
ing foreign investment and on expanding trade 
with Communist countries while also maintaining 
Western European and US trade options. 
!Their optimism that Western European 
countries will continue to do business as usual 
under an Allende government is well-founded. 
French automotive firms have announced that 
they will continue with a $2.2-million minority 
investment in a new assembly plant in Chile, and 
British banking interests are planning to sign a 
$10-million long-term loan to finance imports by

the government development agency. The pro-
Allende media are hailing these developments as 
proof that warnings of economic chaos are un-
founded. 
Recent terrorist incidents attributed by left-
ists and rightists to each other are adding to the 
nervousness among Chileans uncertain as to what 
will happen next. The Communist leaders fear 
that Allende may be assassinated. They believe 
that his death would trigger widespread violence 
that would strengthen leftist extremists who con-
sider armed struggle the only road to power and 
who reject the Communist thesis that "via pacif-
ica" is effective in Chile. Communist concern is 
reflected in press accusations that the US and its 
representatives are plotting with Chilean rightists 
against Allende.I

ECUADOR: The makeup of Ecuador's military 
hierarchy was radically changed last week when 
more than a dozen conservative colonels and the 
chief of the armed forces general staff were sum-
marily retired. This move by the ambitious minis-
ter of defense, Jorge Acosta Velasco, who has 
recently been acting as though he were in charge 
of the entire government, was probably motivated 
by his desire to build his support among those 
"reform-minded" lieutenant colonels in command 
positions. As Acosta and the military continue to

Jamaica: Labor Troubles 
Prime Minister Shearer's important labor 
support has been threatened by a power struggle 
between the two major unions. A strike over pay 
and worker dismissals that began on 16 August at 
the Alcoa plant construction project erupted into 
violence on 24 September. The walkout has 
grown into a jurisdictional fight between the 
country's two major labor unions�the Busta-
mante Industrial Trade Union (BITU), which is 
the labor arm of the prime minister's Jamaican 
Labor Party (JLP), and the National Workers 
Union (NWU), which is controlled by the opposi-
tion People's National Party. For its part, Alcoa 
has informed the government that because of 
continuing labor disturbances and rising costs it 
has been forced into making a "complete reap-
praisal" of its Jamaican activities. This will fur-
ernment operations, opposition elements have 
seriously begun to criticize the regime. The mayor 
of Guayaquil and the Prefect of Guayas Province, 
both of whom are important political leaders, 
were removed from office and arrested on 27 
September for their criticism of the government. 
President Velasco has asked former minister of 
government Gab o Martinez Merchan to resolve the 
crisis in Guayaquil, an indication that Martinez is 
gradually returning to power. 
ther complicate the government's chances of find-
ing a solution to the problem. 
The government is fighting hard to prevent a 
vote to determine which union will represent the 
workers. The Alcoa site is in Prime Minister 
Shearer's parliamentary constituency, and a de-
feat of the BITU, which seems likely in an honest 
vote, would be a heavy blow to the JLP. The 
government has marshaled goon squads to intimi-
date workers and has been successful in having 
the poll postponed. According to a JLP spokes-
man, the issue could be an important factor in the 
general elections, which must be called by early 
1972. The two political parties are very evenly 
matched nationwide, and both draw their support 
primarily from labor.

THE FATE OF CHINA'S YOUTH 
Four years ago the youth of Communist China were caught up in a maelstrom of rebellion aimed 
at turning an entrenched governing bureaucracy on its head and remolding the nation's society and 
people. Under the banner of the Red Guard movement, youthful activists emerged as the spearhead of 
Mao Tse-tung's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and made a frontal attack on the educational 
system, harried much of the highest leadership, and spread political chaos throughout the land. Their 
activities captured the imagination of the Western press and of many "new left" student leaders outside 
China, who saw similarities between their movements and that of China's young militants. 
The Red Guard movement, however, was only superficially a spontaneous outpouring of youthful 
discontent and unrest against the "establishment." In actual fact, the Red Guards were largely pawns in 
a great domestic political struggle over 
power and policy that was initiated not by 
the students but by the regime. The artifi-
cial and carefully structured growth of the 
Red Guard movement is no better illus-
trated than in its rather abrupt and conclu-
sive official demise in the summer of 1968. 
The end of the usefulness of student acti-
vists as political instruments having been 
unmistakably demonstrated to the regime, 
it eventually rusticated hundreds of thou-
sands of them for political "re-education" 
and reform through labor. 
Because of the harsh repression they 
have suffered since 1968, China's students 
today are probably more cynical, apathetic, 
and disheartened than at any time since the 
Communists took power in 1949. Even though they did not rebel against the system entirely on their 
own initiative, China's students did have outstanding grievances and many of them willingly lent 
themselves to the Red Guard movement in the belief that it would rectify such ills as an inadequate 
educational system, shortage of job opportunities, and limited career mobility. All of these grievances 
are currently being dealt with by the regime but in accordance with the conflicting imperatives of 
Maoist ideology and current political realities rather than in response to specific student demands. Thus, 
despite the fact that the regime continues to pay lip service to China's youth as Mao Tse-tung's 
"revolutionary successors," their influence on policy is nil and their succession is a long way off. In the 
meantime, barring another revolution from above, China's youth are likely to continue to express their 
discontent and dissatisfaction through the time-honored practice of passive resistance and foot-dragging 
rather than through direct assault on the establishment itself.

The Monkey Kings 
"Revolutionaries are Monkey Kings, their golden 
rods are terrible, their supernatural powers far-
reaching and their magic omnipotent, for they 
possess Mao Tse-tung's great invincible thought. 
We wield our golden rods, display our superna-
tural powers, and use our magic to turn the old 
world upside down, smash it to pieces, pulverize 
it, and create chaos�the greater confusion the 
better. We are bent on creating a tremendous 
proletarian uproar, and hewing out a proletarian 
new world!" 
Red Guard Poster, 24 June 1966 
Many "new left" student leaders in the West 
have noted similarities between their "move-
ments" and those of the Red Guards who were 
the spearhead of China's Great Proletarian Cul-
tural Revolution in 1966-68. Some parallels 
superficially are quite striking. The Red Guards 
appeared to be attacking the increasingly irrele-
vant and worn-out remnants of a used-up cultural 
tradition. They were fanatic and not open to 
appeals for compromise and reasoned adjustment. 
Their attack on the self-satisfied Communist 
bureaucracy that had grown up since 1949 ap-
peared to reflect a deep-seated hatred of the twin 
Special Report 
evils of hypocrisy and inertia. Above all, the Red 
Guards believed that they were about to inherit 
the earth. And initially many militant Red Guard 
groups directed their ire specifically at the admin-
istrative apparatus of an educational system that 
did not seem capable of preparing them for the 
future that propaganda had assured them was to 
be theirs. 
The Red Guard phenomenon, however, did 
not arise out of unfulfilled youthful expectations 
but out of internecine quarreling within the hier-
archy. It was brought into existence and pro-
tected by the highest levels of a Chinese regime 
that had closed schools in the summer of 1966 
precisely so that the students could "make revolu-
tion." The major targets of Red Guard attacks�
entrenched party, government, and academic of-
ficials who were charged with resisting Mao's lead-
ership�were chosen by the regime. The radical 
Red Guard leaders were in close communication 
with extremist colleagues of Mao in Peking and 
took their orders directly from them. In addition, 
as the Red Guard movement spread throughout 
China it was backed up by an elaborate logistics 
network supported by the state. The more im-
portant radical Red Guard groups also communi-
cated with one another and with Peking over the 
state-run telegraph net. These activities could not 
have occurred without backing from the central 
authorities, and in this sense the Red Guard 
movement was an artificial�and in many ways 
highly structured�movement quite different from 
the student protests in the West and in some 
other Asian states. 
The Revolutionary Tradition 
To say that the Red Guard movement was 
wholly inspired and manipulated by the regime is 
not to deny Mao's genuine concern with culti-
vating "revolutionary successors" or to imply that 
political activism is alien to China's youth. In-
deed, the modern Chinese revolution largely 
began with the famous student-inspired "May 
4th" movement of 1919 that followed the over-
throw of the Manchu dynasty. "May 4th"

represented the reaction of Chinese youth against 
traditional culture and custom that had failed to 
adapt China to the modern world as symbolized, 
at that time, by the shabby treatment China re-
ceived at the peace conference in Paris. It was no 
accident that the most influential journal of that 
period was called New Youth or that its editor, 
Ch'en Tu-hsiu, was one of the co-founders of the 
Chinese Communist Party. 
The cultural system that came under attack 
in 1919 had always accorded a special place to 
the scholar. The imperial mandarinate was an 
administrative system peopled by a scholar-elite. 
The way to advancement was through study and 
examination, and the rewards frequently were 
great. Beyond material advantage, the educated 
man traditionally was accorded a position of 
honor in society. The pace of success, however, 
was very slow. Rewards and honor went to the 
old and aging while the young remained sub-
ordinate. Scholarship was devoted to quasi-
Confucian ends bearing little relationship to the 
needs of the modern world. 
The "May 4th" movement turned all this 
upside down: the youthful students who were the 
spearhead of the movement were exalted over 
their hidebound and repressive elders, and tradi-
tional concerns and attitudes were denounced in 
favor of the liberating influence of modern tech-
niques and Western intellectual currents. "May 
4th" was the fountainhead of both the Commu-
nist movement and the Chinese nationalist move-
ment in its modern form, as well as the source 
point for most Chinese intellectual trends of this 
century. 
The implications of this movement, how-
ever, really were not clear-cut, as they once 
seemed. Elderly scholars were denounced and 
derided�but by younger scholars. Modern West-
ern intellectual fashions, including Marxism, 
flowed into China�but the Maoist version of 
Marxism, which in time became the new ortho-
doxy, contained a heavy infusion of notions de-
rived from a romantic view of the traditional, 
Special Report 
peasant-based uprisings that had punctuated Chi-
nese history. Above all, although Confucianism as 
an administrative and philosophic system was dis-
carded, the ethical and cultural assumptions on 
which it rested in large degree survived. The spe-
cific gravity of a culture that had remained vir-
tually intact for some three thousand years 
proved very high, and the consequences of this 
fact still are working themselves out. 
One immediate result of the "May 4th" 
movement was to fuse the connection between 
students and politics. Youthful activists not only 
played a major part in mobilizing public opinion 
against "imperialism" in the early 1920s but were 
also prominent in the growth of the nationalist 
movement later in the decade. Student disen-
chantment with Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang 
was an important factor in the long duel between 
the Communists and the Chinese Nationalists. 
The idealistic fervor of these children's crusades 
continued to be important in the fluid politics of 
the 1920s, 30s, and 40s. It was much less so, 
however, after the Communist take-over in 1949. 
The Legacy of Discontent 
In its initial years, the stock of the new 
order among most of the politically conscious 
young people was extremely high. The achieve-
ments of Mao Tse-tung and his colleagues since 
the mid-1930s had indeed been remarkable. They 
had gone from one victory to another�they had 
unified China, fought the US to a draw in Korea, 
halted a runaway inflation, and put China on the 
road to economic development and modern iza-
ton. These accomplishments gave the regime a 
mantle of invincibility, and young people were 
willing to accept its dictates at face value. Their 
optimism was also buoyed by the romantic incen-
tive of serving social and political idealism that 
promised them participation in political action 
aimed at overcoming past weaknesses, such as an 
oppressive traditional social order, a fragmented 
political system, and an ineffective government.

As the years wore on, Chinese youth were 
presented with a series of disillusioning facts and 
unpalatable choices, and many lost their revolu-
tionary elan. The students diminished as a politi-
cal force and discovered that the Communists 
were as unsatisfactory from an idealistic point of 
view as the nationalists had been. By the eve of 
the Cultural Revolution, student discontent had 
built up to the point where many were eager to 
respond to the Maoists' cry that "there can be no 
construction without prior destruction." 
China's educational facilities, for example, 
had expanded greatly since the Communist take-
over in 1949, but they had not kept pace with a 
burgeoning population approaching over 800 mil-
lion people�almost half of them under twenty-
one. Competition for places in universities and 
colleges was keen, and even those who did man-
age to acquire education frequently found that 
they were still stymied. Meaningful jobs commen-
surate with educational level and skills were often 
not available, and any openings frequently in-
volved transfer from the comparative comfort of 
the great cities of east and central China to re-
mote and backward outposts. Moreover, the lead-
ership that had taken power at the end of the civil 
war had not relinquished its stranglehold on mid-
dle and upper echelon jobs. As the queue for 
these grew longer, the waiting period grew more 
frustrating. 
The problem of limited career mobility was 
made all the more acute because the regime very 
early on had deliberately fostered rising expecta-
tions by painting a glowing picture of a modern 
and powerful China to be built by the younger 
generation. University students naturally assumed 
that they were going to take their places as lead-
ers and builders of the new society. Because the 
professional and technical specialists needed for 
modernization were in short supply, not all stu-
dents found their hopes dashed. But the absurdi-
ties of Mao's Great Leap Forward in 1958-1959 
and the consequent social and economic retrench-
ment in the early 1960s led to a decline in educa-
tional opportunities across the board; as a result, 
Special Report 
job opportunities were even further curtailed. The 
collapse of the leap forward forced the regime to 
renege on many of its golden promises and in-
stead, to offer to much of the youth only long 
years of dour and unrewarding struggle. For many 
urban students, this meant banishment to the 
villages to provide mere manual labor in support 
of the post-leap efforts to step up agricultural 
development. To steel themselves for further sac-
rifices, the youth were told to emulate the very 
ordinary achievements of a model army hero, Lei 
Feng, who wrote: 
"Some people call me an idiot. I want to 
do good deeds for the state and people. If 
they say I am an idiot, then I am willing 
to be one. The revolution needs voluntary 
idiots like me." 
Meanwhile, for those who remained in 
school, tensions also were high. This was partially 
a direct result of regime goals that in practice 
conflicted rather than complemented an attempt 
to modernize the country on the one hand and an 
attempt ideologically to remold Chinese society 
on the other. Mao had shown an awareness of 
these tensions, but his attempts to solve the prob-
lem before the Cultural Revolution exacerbated 
rather than relieved the situation. 
In China, as elsewhere, education is the key 
to advancement�however long deferred. Many of 
those who were best qualified intellectually for 
higher education were interested merely in mate-
rial rewards and perquisites that a modernizing 
society must pay to the relatively small group 
that has attained technical proficiency. "Career-
ism," cynical or otherwise, became increasingly 
prevalent as the first flush of revolutionary enthu-
siasm wore off. At the same time, however, the 
regime was strongly emphasizing that China's 
youth would soon inherit both the country and 
the Chinese Communist revolutionary tradition. 
Mao in particular was concerned lest tradition be 
diluted by an indifferent youth bent on pursuit of 
their careers. He insisted that peasant and work-
ing-class background be the prime consideration

ing. 
Red Guard diatribes, even when discounted 
for polemical exaggeration, make it clear, how-
ever, that purely academic qualifications con-
tinued to play a part in the selection process after 
Mao's abortive attempt to lower educational 
standards during the Great Leap period. Stiff en-
trance requirements and difficult exams were re-
instituted, allegedly against Mao's will, in an ef-
fort to raise the caliber of the students who were 
to become the technically qualified elite of the 
future. Thus, peasant and poor worker youths, 
told that they were China's "revolutionary succes-
sors" and uniquely fitted for this role by virtue of 
their backgrounds, found that the "class enemy" 
still was accorded preferment in the educational 
system. The hatred thus engendered boiled over 
in the early phases of the Cultural Revolution, 
when opposing student Red Guard groups broke 
down along class lines�particularly at the more 
prestigious universities where bourgeois students 
were numerous. 
Red Guard Goals 
The various frustrations, currents, and coun-
tercurrents faced by the youth before the Cul-
tural Revolution were an explosive mixture, but it 
took a deliberate act on the part of the regime to 
ignite the fuse. Moreover, the Red Guard move-
ment was never a unitary whole, and as the re-
gime's revolution against itself ebbed and flowed, 
various Red Guard groups were employed as op-
posing political instruments both by the Maoists 
in Peking and by the civilian and army officials 
who were under attack. Insofar as Red groups of 
any persuasion could be said to have had a posi-
tive program, it was to acquire power by replacing 
disgraced former officials who had come to be 
regarded as symbols of the frustrating status quo. 
This ambition probably was confined to the lead-
ers of the various Red Guard groups, but at all 
levels there was the hope that the log jam block-
ing the way to relatively rapid advancement could 
be broken. In retrospect, however, there was 
Special Report 
never much likelihood that Red Guards would 
secure an appreciable number of important posi-
tions. 
Implicit in Red Guard attacks on "power 
holders" was the larger, less well-defined aim of 
purifying the system. Starting from the Maoist 
premise of the corrupting influence of "revision-
ism," the Red Guards tended to attribute their 
frustrations to the ideological mistakes of the 
"power holders." Nevertheless, the evils that they 
attacked�bureaucracy, routinization, specializa-
tion, and pragmatic devotion to efficiency at the 
expense of ideology�were all inevitable manifes-
tations of the modernization process. The Red 
Guards' demand for purity was thus in effect a 
call for a primitive, utopian Communism�a call 
that echoed Mao Tse-tung's demand for a new 
generation of true believers who would dedicate 
themselves even more fervently to the Chinese 
Communist revolutionary tradition. 
Because these romantic and idealistic strands 
in the Red Guard program were unrealizable, 
cynicism and "careerism," those objects of Red 
Guard scorn, tended to grow rather than diminish 
among the students. In many instances, the stu-
dents' general hope for advancement degenerated 
into a cynical "what's-in-it-for-me" attitude. As 
inconclusive battles for power between Red 
Guard factions dragged on, more and more indi-
viduals opted out of the struggle entirely and 
refused to become committed to any side. Many 
became drifters living from hand to mouth, while 
others gravitated toward criminal activities. 
The Fate of the Red Guards 
The success of the Red Guards�and their 
mentors in Peking�in destroying the party appa-
ratus during the Cultural Revolution meant that a 
power vacuum had to be filled to get the country 
running again. By 1968 it was clear that the 
vacuum would be filled by the army and that the 
fate of the Red Guard movement was sealed. The 
Red Guards themselves were incapable of sup-
planting the apparatus they had helped to

Propagandizing the Ideal

Young People 
Raised on Mao Tse-tung Thought, the twenty-year-old Red Guard Chin Hsun-hua grew to be a firm 
proletarian revolutionary. 
In 1966, as Chairman Mao lit the flames of the 
Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chin Hsun-

Chin Hsun-Hua arrived in Heilungkiang in May 1969. He did everything in the 
revolutionary spirit of "fearing neither hardship nor death." Building a house, he 
got covered with mud from head to foot. Binding wheat, he was soaked with 
sweat. When people told him to rest, he answered, "The more I sweat, the less 
soft I'll be." 
Chin Hsun-hua spread Mao 
Tse-tung Thought enthusias-
tically. Whenever a new in-
struction of Chairman Mao 
was published, he would cut a 
stencil, mimeograph it and 
take it around to the peasants. 
Once when he arrived at Aunt 
Sung's house, the family was 
already in bed. But they got 
up at once, lit a lamp and sat

and lower-middle peasants' 
love for Chairman Mao taught 
Chin Hsun-hua a lot. 
During a flood on August IS, 1969, several telephone poles on the river bank floated 
away. Chin Hsun-hua jumped into the raging waters to save the state's property. He 
lost his life in the battle, fulfilling his vow to "fight to the death for Chairman Mao."

destroy, and it seems highly likely that Mao never 
intended them to play a major role in adminis-
tering the country. He may well have regretted 
having to alienate the Red Guards whom he had 
hailed as "revolutionary successors," but once the 
regime finally decided that their usefulness as 
political instruments was over, it moved swiftly 
and cynically to repress them. Without so much 
as missing a turn, the enormous propaganda ma-
chinery put the nation on notice in August 1968 
that the vanguard of the revolution was no longer 
the Red Guards but the more orthodox "worker/ 
peasant proletariat" 
Beginning in the late summer and fall of 
1968, most armed Red Guard factions were 
broken up and their adherents brutally suppressed 
by the army, and the movement itself ceased to 
count politically. Although so-called "congresses" 
of Red Guards were subsequently established in 
major urban centers theoretically to provide 
youth a voice in local affairs, such organizations 
were controlled and manipulated by the authori-
ties. Moreover, the membership of the congresses 
apparently consisted largely of those factionalists 
supporting the civil and military leaders who 
eventually emerged triumphant in the Cultural 
Revolution; for those Red Guards who backed 
their opponents a worse fate was in store. 
Large numbers of chronic troublemakers and 
the rank and file of factions that wound up on 
the losing side were shipped off to army-run labor 
camps; many of their leaders were tried by drum-
head courts and sentenced to death. Although the 
numbers killed were never disclosed, some inkling 
of the extent of the executions was revealed in 
the summer of 1968 when hundreds of bodies of 
militant factionalists from Kwangsi Province were 
found floating down the river to Hong Kong, 
trussed up like lambs going to slaughter. 
Not all former Red Guards suffered so mean 
a fate. Some of their representatives have been 
introduced into leadership posts in local govern-
ment and party apparatus. Some leaders of the 
movement have even been elevated to the party's 
Special Report 
Central Committee, which was deliberately ex-
panded after the Cultural Revolution to make 
room for Mao's "revolutionary successors." It 
should be noted, however, that many of these 
ex-Red Guards were not students at all but rather 
lower echelon "activist" bureaucrats from the 
former party and government apparatus. But, de-
spite their rise to higher positions, they are un-
likely ever to be capable of serving as much more 
than political tools for more powerful elements in 
the establishment. 
The initial Draconian measures taken against 
the majority of the Red Guards were reinforced 
by other programs aimed at curbing disorders and 
reducing the opportunities for former factional-
ists to kick up their heels again. The nation's 
colleges and universities, which were still oc-
cupied by unemployed students, were taken over 
by worker propaganda teams backed by armed 
soldiers. This combination moved swiftly to re-
store a semblance of order among a population of 
quarrelsome student bodies whose numbers had 
not diminished because of the near freeze on 
promotions and job assignments from 1966 to 
1968. 
The most comprehensive measure employed 
to solve the problems of restless youth, however, 
was forcible emigration to the countryside. By 
the fall of 1968, the government had determined 
to send 90 percent of the middle school and 
university students of the classes of 1966, 1967, 
and 1968 (later extended to 1969) to army-run 
labor camps, state farms in remote border regions, 
rural construction projects, or agricultural com-
munes. This program solved the dilemma in 
several ways. It provided order-oriented local of-
ficials with a means for punishing recalcitrant 
factionalists and for disposing of the many stu-
dents who had returned to the cities during the 
Cultural Revolution. It helped ease pressures on 
the limited urban job market by getting rid of a 
huge backlog of unemployed students and under-
employed young workers. It also complemented 
the regime's renewed efforts to improve rural 
development by injecting an educated labor force

that could help apply modern technology to agri-
cultural production, overcome rural illiteracy, 
raise rural health standards, and reduce the dis-
crepancies between the advanced urban centers 
and the vast backward peasant communities. 
Finally, the program served the long-standing 
utopian end of developing Mao's "revolutionary 
successors" by teaching them how to work and 
identify with the masses they supposedly would 
eventually lead. The old promise of revolutionary 
succession had a hollow ring, however, because 
many of the youthful emigres were told they 
would have to spend the rest of their lives in the 
countryside. Few youths welcomed the prospect 
of once again serving as "volunteer idiots" for a 
regime that had used and then discarded them so 
hypocritically in the Cultural Revolution. 
Life on the Fann 
The rustication of China's students was only 
one aspect of an over-all program that since 
August 1968 has probably sent upwards of 20 
million city residents to the countryside. Never-
theless, the impact of the back-to-the-country 
movement has been greatest on middle school, 
college, and university students, who constitute 
perhaps over one half of all those transferred. 
From the fragmentary evidence available, the pro-
gram appears to have had a devastatingly negative 
impact on the morale of the youths; the process 
of adjustment to their new fate is likely to cause 
painful headaches for China's overburdened local 
administrators for some time to come. 
That the youth of China are shocked and 
dismayed at the cruel turn of events in the wake 
of the Cultural Revolution is not surprising. In 
1966 they were told that they could expect to 
inherit the earth. In 1970 they find themselves 
tilling it instead. Most find the transition difficult 
and degrading. Although some students are for-
tunate enough to land back in their home villages, 
most are deposited purposely in unfamiliar and 
frequently hostile surroundings. 
Special Report 
The anger and frustration of the youths is 
more than matched by that of their involuntary 
hosts. To the peasants, the "assignees" are an 
unwanted burden, more mouths to feed. The 
peasants often reserve the hardest tasks for their 
state-appointed guests. Some undoubtedly derive 
a special sense of power and satisfaction in being 
able to pile the workload on the crass students 
who arrive on the farms exuding an air of superi-
ority. Official editorial comment on the problem 
shows that peasants frequently rationalize their 
attitude on the ground that "in farming work, 
intellectual youths have many impractical ideas, 
and it is difficult enough just to teach them how 
to carry or lift loads on their shoulders or with 
their hands." 
Over the past year, the regime has been 
pushing local officials to make better use of the 
students' education and aptitudes, and there 
clearly has been progress in this direction. Some 
students have assumed iower level leadership posi-
tions, and efforts have been made in a few areas 
to groom more leaders by admitting youths into 
nascent Young Communist League branches. Still 
other youths are supposed to open primary 
schools and conduct part-time study sessions for 
adults or for students who cannot be spared from 
labor during the day. In addition, many of the 
students sent to the countryside are being trained 
as "barefoot doctors." Finally, some students 
who originally came from rural areas have been 
used to open agricultural research stations. 
The vast majority of youths, however, prob-
ably are still serving as ordinary field laborers 
who, at best, are merely accepting their fate with 
sullen resignation. Indeed, there is ample testi-
mony to this in the number of complaints in 
regime propaganda about the students apathetic 
attitude toward accepting re-education from the 
peasants and their preoccupation with "becoming 
officials." In recent months, Peking has fre-
quently admonished rural authorities to pay more 
attention to organizing the production activities 
of their youthful charges and to be more active in 
helping them solve their problems. As a result of

such
-
such pressures from above, commune authorities 
reportedly are assigning special personnel to han-
dle youth work, and top officials from urban 
areas are being sent to check on how their young 
emigres are faring in the villages. 
Despite intensified efforts by the regime to 
rationalize the youth resettlement program, prob-
lems are not confined merely to the rural areas 
and continue to mount. Although the bulk of the 
college classes of 1966 through 1968 have been 
resettled and universities are beginning to reopen, 
Peking apparently plans to continue assigning a 
majority of urban middle-school graduates to 
rural labor for periods of two to three years or 
longer. Some of these graduates reportedly are 
resisting emigration actively and, as a result,urban 
authorities have been forced to employ increas-
ingly harsh measures, such as arresting the youths' 
parents, to meet rural assignment quotas. 
Meanwhile, the substantial number of dis-
satisfied youths who continue to return illegally 
from the countryside is causing increasing con-
cern to security officials in many cities. Because 
these returnees no longer have urban residency 
permits, ration cards, or access to legitimate em-
ployment, they are forced to turn to criminal 
activities to eke out a living. The extent of this 
problem is difficult to determine, but some idea is 
provided by the numerous mass trials held 
throughout China since last January. These dealt 
with a wide range of social, economic, and politi-
cal offenses in a further effort to restore the civil 
discipline and control so badly undermined by 
the Cultural Revolution. The large number of 
common criminals placed on trial and the high 
incidence of crimes cited such as robbery, pick-
pocketing, forgery, and prostitution are unusual 
in China, suggesting that many of the offenders 
are illegal returnees from the countryside who 
have unexpectedly turned from "revolutionary 
successors" into juvenile delinquents. 
Crisis of Authority 
The difficulties that local authorities have 
been having with youths in both town and 
Special Report 
countryside point up an interesting paradox; de-
spite the severe repression of former Red Guards 
and even though the majority of young people 
probably accept their post - Cultural Revolution 
fate with sullen resignation, there is an unusually 
high incidence of youthful indiscipline in China 
today. This is reflected not only in reports of 
criminal acts but also in editorial comment on 
quarreling between rural assignees and their peas-
ant mentors, "anarchism" among young factory 
workers, and even indiscipline in the ranks of the 
army. Pre-teen and teen-age youths have been 
reported staging street rallies, arguing in public 
with policemen, and haranguing adult passers-by. 
Such behavior was unknown before the Cultural 
Revolution and although it is not allowed to get 
out of hand today, young people apparently now 
feel more license to engage in give and take with 
the authorities. 
Part of the reason for this unusual phenome-
non lies in an inherent contradiction in the re-
gime's approach to young people. While on the 
one hand it has authorized cruelly suppressive 
measures to restore social discipline, on the other 
it instructs officials to recognize that the disil-
lusionment of today's youth is a severe and trying 
hurdle that should primarily be overcome through 
political re-education and persuasion. There is 
therefore a gray area in which local authorities 
must move cautiously, allowing greater latitude 
for open, although nonviolent, expression of 
some concerns and grievances. 
Another explanation for the marked changes 
in the attitude of youth toward authority lies in 
what transpired during the Cultural Revolution 
itself. By using young activists as the spearhead of 
their attack on their party and government op-
ponents, the Maoists brought into existence mass 
organizations whose sole purpose was opposition 
to recognized authority. Once having been al-
lowed to challenge the legitimacy of the establish-
ment, it is not easy for former Red Guards to 
accept the dictates of the power holders who have 
emerged from the Cultural Revolution. This prob-
lem is made all the more acute because many 
veteran civil and military officials have been

returned to power who were the targets of Red 
Guard attacks, and the former young activists 
apparently feel they have been victimized by a 
cruel hypocrisy. 
Finally, the Cultural Revolution introduced 
into the fabric of national life many sharply 
etched antagonisms and divisions that have dra-
matically affected the actions and outlook of the 
politically conscious young. The quarrels over 
power and policy between competing Red Guards 
and between them and their bureaucratic op-
ponents, as well as divisions over the future direc-
tion of China's revolution, have had an enormous 
carry-over effect and are present at every level 
where youth confronts authority. This phenome-
non is likely to make it increasingly difficult for 
the regime to reconcile its authoritarian tenden-
cies in running the state and in modernizing the 
country on the one hand and its desire�in part 
ideological, in part politically practical�to main-
tain revolutionary momentum and to convince 
the younger generation that its interests are still 
identical with those of the regime on the other. 
Bleak Present, Uncertain Future 
The traumatic impact of the Cultural Revo-
lution on China's youth and the variety of repres-
sive actions taken by the regime afterward might 
easily have been anticipated. Their fair hopes 
blasted, students and other young people on the 
whole are now probably the most alienated, 
apathetic, and unhappy segment of the Chinese 
populace. Within the past year the regime has 
taken some action on problems that concerned 
the students before the Cultural Revolution, but 
the "solutions" have the old familiar ring. For 
example, efforts have been made to assign jobs to 
some former university students who have es-
caped rural resettlement; these, however, often are 
still not always commensurate with the skill levels 
of the employees. Efforts are apparently being 
made in some cities to give middle-school gradu-
ates of 1969 the opportunity to choose urban 
factory assignments over rural resettlement; still it 
appears that the choice is given only to a fortu-
Special Report 
nate few while the majority are expected to 
"volunteer" for labor in the countryside. Finally, 
universities have begun to reopen this fall after a 
four-year hiatus, but admission criteria have a 
heavy political bias. The criteria do contain a 
number of loopholes that could allow students 
who have been rusticated since 1968 an oppor-
tunity to renew their education, but the returns 
are not yet in on how many this would involve or 
the quality of the academic training they will 
receive. In any case, Peking's most recent com-
mentary on enrollment policy suggests that a 
large percentage of the students in the college 
classes of 1967, 1968, and 1969, who have al-
ready been labeled "graduates" by the regime, 
will have "to find outlets for their talents in the 
countryside" rather than in the universities. 
As to the future prospects of this year's 
middle-school graduates, some localities appar-
ently have held examinations to determine the 
best academically qualified for university admis-
sion. The regime, however, maintains that most of 
those who will matriculate in the future must 
have performed several years of manual labor and 
have the proper worker-peasant - class back-
ground. Such criteria may be eventually modified 
if it appears that they are preventing the matricu-
lation of a student body capable of undertaking 
scientific research and other professional training 
in addition to the heavier doses of political and 
vocational courses that Mao has ordered the uni-
versities to offer. Nevertheless, future college stu-
dents are likely to be more mature than in the 
past and fewer in number, inasmuch as the pres-
ent rustication program seems designed to ex-
clude a sizable percentage of those who graduated 
from middle schools during the Cultural Revolu-
tion. 
Ultimately, the disillusionment of Chinese 
students with the outcome of the Cultural Revo-
lution could redound to the advantage of a more 
moderate and pragmatic leadership in the post-
Mao era. There is no sign, however, that the 
general malaise of China's youth will translate 
itself into any serious obstacle to the continued

stability of the regime or even a significant turn-
ing away from Communism's idealized political 
and social goals. There is no organized student 
opposition in China today, and all indications are 
that in the future "student power" will again be 
carefully channeled into party-directed activities. 
To help ensure this, the former Young Commu-
nist League is apparently being reconstituted 
along much the same lines as before to prevent 
youthful elements from striking out on a path 
independent of the party. 
In all likelihood, China's youth will continue 
to remain rather docile and malleable, at least by 
Western standards. As an interest group their 
Special Report 
needs and demands will probably continue to be 
formulated and articulated from above rather 
than below. As individuals they will attempt to 
alleviate some of the harshness and severity of 
their existence without risking much direct con-
flict with the system. They are, after all, products 
of a society that has long been skilled in the 
tactics of "seeming to comply, while secretly dis-
obeying." In any case, their fate lies not in their 
hands but in those of the military and party 
figures who eventually seized the levers of power 
in the Cultural Revolution. Any changes in the 
immediate future in Communist China will be 
wrought by these men and not by today's "revo-
lutionary successors."

CONSTRAINTS ON THE SOVIET OIL POSITION, 1970-80 
Since the mid-1950s the USSR has been a substantial net exporter of 
oil. In recent years, oil sales have been the country's largest single source of 
hard currency. In 1969, however, the Minister of the Petroleum Extraction 
Industry, V.D. Shashin, declared that total Soviet exports of oil will not 
increase significantly in the future because domestic demand will rise faster 
than production. He also said that the USSR will maintain a high level of 
exports to Eastern Europe but expressed doubt that exports to the West will 
show much further increase. Shashin's predictions may well err on the side 
of optimism. Analysis confirms the suggestion that during the 1970s Soviet 
consumption of oil is likely to increase faster than production. By 1980 
there still will be an excess of production over domestic consumption, but 
the excess will be less than the import requirements of Eastern Europe. The 
USSR already has begun procuring small quantities of Middle Eastern and 
North African oil under barter agreements for re-export to other Communist 
countries. Encouraged by the Soviets, the East European states also have 
been bartering directly for Middle Eastern oil. The Soviets probably hope 
that oil obtained in this manner will permit them to maintain oil sales in 
hard currency markets at current levels. 
Production 
The USSR has emerged as a major oil pro-
ducing nation only in the last two decades. Soviet 
crude oil production, which rose from 37.9 mil-
lion metric tons in 1950 to 147.9 million in 1960, 
should reach 350 million this year. Thanks to this 
upsurge, the Soviet Union now is second only to 
the United States in crude oil output. The rate of 
increase has declined, however, from almost 16 
percent per year during 1956-60 to a less spec-
tacular but still rapid rate of nearly eight percent 
annually. 
Special Report 
During the post-1950 expansion of oil pro-
duction, Azerbaydzhan�where fields had been 
producing since tsarist times�was eclipsed as the 
principal Soviet source of oil by the prolific 
Urals-Volga region. Although production in the 
North Caucasus, West Siberia, and Central Asia 
subsequently increased considerably, the Urals-
Volga region still accounted for some 60 percent 
of national output as recently as last year. 
Soviet authorities originally predicted that 
the Urals-Volga fields alone would be yielding 
350 million tons of oil a year by 1980, but they

now indicate indicate that annual production there will be 
at its peak this year at about 207 million tons. 
The amount of oil that ultimately can be re-
covered from this region has been reduced by 
extraction at excessive rates and by faulty use of 
water injection to maintain reservoir pressure. In-
jected water has encroached on producing oil 
zones and has isolated sizable pockets of oil, 
rendering them unrecoverable. 
Costly blunders have not been confined to 
the Urals-Volga region, but have occurred in prac-
tically all oil producing areas. In addition to ex-
cessively rapid extraction and faulty water injec-
tion, a common mistake has been. large-scale burn-
ing off of the natural gas found in association 
with oil. The gas should be recycled into the 
deposits to maintain pressure and utilized after 
the extraction of oil has been completed. In the 
important fields of western Kazakhstan, asso-
ciated gas was burned off instead of being re-
cycled. Then cold sea water was injected in an 
attempt to restore pressure, and much of the oil, 
which is high in paraffin content, solidified. As a 
result, production targets have had to be cut 
drastically. 
Obstacles 
Under constant urging to maximize short-
run achievements, Soviet oil technicians have 
worked feverishly with poor equipment and ob-
solete technology. The geophysical instruments 
they use to map geological structures are gen-
erally outdated. In seismograph technology, 
which is used in the exploration of deep, complex 
geological formations, the USSR is seven to ten 
years behind the US. The Soviets continue to rely 
on turbodrills for as much as 80 percent of all 
operations, both for shallow and deep drilling. 
The transition to greater reliance on rotary drill-
ing, best suited for deeper drilling, is impeded by 
a shortage of high-quality drill pipe. Soviet deep-
drilling capability also is limited by a shortage of 
high-powered mud pumps and high quality drill 
bits. Burdened with their many handicaps, Soviet 
Special Report - 3 - 
drillers require eight to ten months to drill wells 
that American crews could sink in a single month. 
Transportation of oil continues to encounter 
serious problems. Prior to 1965, most oil was 
shipped by rail, although this mode of transport 
was nearly three times as expensive as movement 
by pipeline. Since 1965, however, pipelines have 
carried the greatest tonnage. At least 80 percent 
of the oil-pipeline network carries crude oil, and 
the remainder oil products. The oil fields of 
Azerbaydzhan and the Urals-Volga region, on 
which the Soviets have depended so heavily, are 
sufficiently distant from major centers of popu-
lation and oil consumption to pose significant 
transport problems. The newly important oil 
fields of Central Asia and West Siberia are even 
less accessible. 
Oil refining, like oil extraction, is techno-
logically backward in the Soviet Union and lags 
far behind the American industry in the quality 
of individual products, in product mix, in the 
depth of refining, and in the sophistication of 
refining processes. This backwardness has resulted 
chiefly from failure to allocate sufficient invest-
ment to refining during a period of rapid growth 
and transition to lower quality crude oils. In part, 
however, the lag in product mix is attributable to 
the pattern of demand, which is influenced by the 
small number of automobiles in the Soviet Union. 
The demand for high-octane gasoline now has 
begun to rise, but facilities for producing it are 
not keeping pace. Expansion of existing refineries 
and construction of new ones consistently have 
fallen short of plans. Nevertheless, primary refin-
ing capacity has increased at an average rate of 
about eight percent a year since 1958 and now is 
second only to that of the US. It is sufficient to 
meet the needs of domestic consumers and to 
provide over 25 million tons of products for ex-
port. 
Consumption 
Soviet oil consumption has increased greatly 
since 1950, but only recently has it approached

the growth rate achieved by production. During 
the decade from 1958-68, consumption of oil 
products rose at an average annual rate of about 
8.4 percent. Despite the existence of an over-all 
surplus of oil, sporadic local shortages of certain 
oil products nevertheless have occurred because 
of failure to turn out the needed range and qual-
ity of products and because of inadequacies in the 
transportation and distribution systems. 
With production outstripping domestic con-
sumption in past years, an increasing portion of 
Soviet oil production was exported. Exports of 
oil and oil products increased about 17 percent 
per year over the decade from 1958 through 
1968. Since 1966, however, the growth of ex-
ports has slowed appreciably, and exports to free 
world countries have leveled off. Even so, exports 
of oil and oil products remain the USSR's biggest 
single earner of hard currency. Last year such 
exports brought in some $340 million. Moreover, 
the Soviet Union serves as the principal suppJer 
of oil to Eastern Europe.

Domestic Prospects Through 1980s 
The USSR has abundant potential resources 
of petroleum, both on and offshore, that could 
enable it to become the world's leading producer 
of petroleum by the end of this century. It is 
estimated that, as of 1 January 1969, the Soviets 
had proved reserves of crude oil of 3.0 to 3.4 
billion tons, or about 10 to 11 times the amount 
produced annually. This situation Is analogous to 
that of the United States, where proved reserves 
were estimated at 4.2 billion tons in 1969, giving 
a ratio of reserves to production of about 10:1. 
To tap their reserves successfully, the Soviets 
must overcome difficult obstacles, of which one 
of the most serious is permafrost. Some 30 to 40 
percent of Soviet reserves lie under permafrost, 
and Soviet technicians have yet to prove that they 
can operate successfully in such conditions. 
Plans call for crude production to rise from 
350 million tons in 1970 to 450 million in 1975,

a goal that implies an average annual growth rate 
of 5.2 percent. This rate, which is well below the 
7.6-percent rate posted during the five year pe-
riod now ending, seems attainable. 
Achievement of the 1980 plan target for 
crude output of 550-600 million tons now seems 
unlikely. An anticipated decline in production in 
some of the older regions, more difficult climatic 
and geological conditions in new producing areas, 
rising exploration and development costs, and a 
shortage of equipment embodying modern tech-
nology�especially for drilling�suggest that pro-
duction in 1980 probably will be in the vicinity 
of 500 million metric tons. This estimate implies 
that production will increase by only 2.1 percent 
per year during the last five years of the decade. 
Because future production depends in part 
upon current drilling rates, it is significant that 
total drilling for exploration and development of 
petroleum resources declined after 1967. Given 
both the Soviets' inexperience with the sophisti-
cated techniques that are becoming more neces-
sary and the more difficult drilling conditions 
anticipated in the 1970s, it is doubtful that aver-
age annual drilling rates will increase very much. 
Shashin has indicated that production goals must 
be achieved by technical progress and without 
any such steep rise in capital investment for drill-
ing as has occurred in recent years. Some im-
provement, however, is possible. The priority as-
signed to the petroleum industry as a leading 
earner of foreign exchange makes it likely that 
Soviet planners will make an effort to provide the 
resources required to solve problems that already 
have been recognized by Soviet technicians. 
Prospects for the three regions that will be 
the USSR's principal sources of oil in the present 
decade are mixed at best. In the Urals-Volga re-
gion, blunders have cut prospects for 1980 pro-
duction by some two thirds. It now seems that 
production in this region will decline from 207 
million metric tons this year to about 180 million 
in 1975 and 100 million in 1980. Production 
from Central Asia is expected to rise more slowly 
Special Report 
- 5 - 
than planned but to reach 60 million tons in 1975 
and 65 million in 1980. West Siberia presents the 
greatest potential but poses the most difficult 
problems. Production in this area may increase 
from 30 million metric tons this year to 100-120 
million in 1975 and 150-200 million in 1980. 
Demand for petroleum products in the So-
viet Union can be projected by its relationship to 
anticipated industrial growth. Using this method 
and taking into account the expected growth of 
the motor vehicle park, it is estimated that the 
USSR will consume approximately 350 million 
tons of oil in 1975 and 450 million tons in 1980. 
Projections of both production and con-
sumption are, of course, subject to error, and 
projections ten years into the future are particu-
larly risky. Western estimates indicate that the 
Soviet excess of production over domestic con-
sumption will rise from 90 million metric tons 
this year to about 100 million in 1975 and then 
decline to about 50 million in 1980. Meanwhile 
East European demand for foreign oil is expected 
to outstrip Soviet supply capability. If the Soviet 
Union is to maintain exports of oil to hard cur-
rency markets in this decade, the USSR and East-
ern Europe will have to obtain oil from non-Com-
munist producers. It seems likely that in 1975 the 
Soviets will be obtaining about 10 million metric 
tons of Middle Eastern and North African oil for 
shipment to other countries on Soviet account. 
Moscow probably hopes to pay for some of this 
oil by bartering technical assistance and equip-
ment for producing oil. By 1980, however, the 
USSR may have to obtain as much as 80 million 
metric tons a year from non-Communist countries 
in order to maintain its deliveries to foreign 
clients. At today's prices this quantity of oil 
would be valued at more than $750 million. In 
addition, the Eastern European countries prob-
ably will need to import some 15 million metric 
tons directly from the Middle East and North 
Africa in 1975 and perhaps 30 million in 1980. 
Even if the Communist countries' imports reach 
the indicated levels, however, the Middle East and

North Africa will remain dependent on free world

Soviet Interest in Middle Eastern and North African Oils 
The USSR's involvement with Middle East-
ern and North African oil, already in evidence for 
a decade, is expected to increase further in the 
1970s. In the last year or two Soviet interest in 
such oil has increased perceptibly, and the USSR 
now has oil pacts with most of the major oil 
producing countries of the Middle East and North 
Africa. 
The first agreement with Iraq was concluded 
in the early 1960s, essentially for political pur-
poses and for its impact on Western oil interests. 
In 1967, however, after Baghdad had reclaimed 
some of its concession areas, the USSR and Iraq 
signed a memorandum under which the Soviets 
would provide technical assistance and equipment 
for exploration and for the extraction, transporta-
tion, and marketing of oil in exchange for crude. 
An agreement signed with Baghdad in June 
1969 and valued at $72 million is repayable in 
hard currency. Another pact, valued at $67 mil-
lion, provides for Soviet assistance in exploiting

in September�and for the surveying of new areas, 
with payment to be made in crude. The Soviets 
also are to lay an 80-mile pipeline to the port of 
Fao, where they will build storage facilities. If 
findings in other fields in southern Iraq justify 
development, the Soviets "will examine the pos-
sibility of providing technical assistance in imple-
menting" development programs there. In carry-
ing out these agreements, the USSR has sent 
numerous experts to Iraq. 
The USSR has been exploring for oil in 
Egypt and may drill as many as 40 exploratory 
wells in the Western Desert, where operations 
began in March. The Soviets are to provide ten 
seismic crews to bolster prospecting operations 
and will deliver six drilling rigs. Furthermore, if 
oil is found, the Soviets will provide credits for 
the development of the field, which will be repaid 
in oil. 
The USSR also is expected to receive two 
million tons of Egyptian crude from the El Mor-
gan field in 1970 in exchange for Soviet oil de-
livered to northern Egypt. As in the past, the 
Egyptian oil probably will be shipped to other 
countries on Soviet account, a practice likely to 
be followed as long as the Suez Canal remains 
closed and the Suez-Mediterranean pipeline re-
mains to be built. 
Soviet involvement in Algerian petroleum at-
fairs began in 1964 with the establishment oi the 
African Petroleum and Textile Institute, where an 
estimated 300 Soviets are on the teaching staff. 
About 200 Soviet oil technicians have been work-
ing in Algeria since 1967. In 1969, the USSR 
Special Report 
contracted to receive 500,000 tons of Algerian oil 
annually through 1975 as part of a barter deal. 
Recently the Soviets and Algerians signed 
several contracts, two of which covered explora-
tion and drilling. At present six drilling rigs are 
operational and the USSR is to provide 15 more. 
I-he USSR will probably not receive many kudos, 
however; most observers describe the Soviet 
equipment as antiquated, perhaps as much as 20 
years behind Western equipment. The rigs are 
usable only for shallow drilling and would be 
unsuitable for exploitation of major Algerian 
fields. 
Soviet exploration in Syria, which has been 
going on for more than ten years, helped Damas-
cus to begin commercial production early in 
1968. The Soviets also provided technical aid for 
construction of a 400-mile pipeline linking the 
fields in northeastern Syria with the Mediter-
ranean port of Tartus. In late 1969 Soviet special-
ists prepared a comprehensive plan for oil produc-
tion, and agreed to aid in the establishment of a 
research laboratory for Syria's proposed oil insti-
tute. 
Six months after seizing power in 1969, the 
new Libyan government took several steps, in-
cluding negotiation for Soviet participation in 
Libyan oil affairs, to reduce its dependence upon 
Western companies. The Soviets have proposed a 
joint exploration venture with the newly or-
ganized Libyan National Oil Company and last 
May sent a delegation of petroleum experts to 
Libya to conduct a one-month study. At that 
time they also agreed to supply three Soviet tech-
nicians to the Libyan Ministry of Petroleum to 
perform a long-term survey of oil reserves I
