 Party's Sixth Plenum:
 Deng Firms His Gri
 Key Judgments          Deng Xiaoping's attempt to ensure political stability and the continuation
 of his reformist policies after he dies made a major advance in June at the
 Sixth Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party's 11th Central Committee,
 when Deng and his followers strengthened their grip on party power. As a
 central element in this effort, Hua Guofeng was replaced as party
 Chairman by Deng's longtime protege, Hu Yaobang.
 The plenum produced a "Resolution" on party history that criticizes Mao
 Zedong and ideologically supports the pragmatic approach Deng and his
 allies have taken in revamping the party line. To obtain the party's
 endorsement of the Resolution, Deng steered a middle course between the
 demands of uncritical Mao loyalists and the extreme condemnations urged
 by some in Deng's wing of the party. The result amounts to a document
 that will remain open to interpretation.
 The victory of Deng and his reform group was delayed six months by
 economic and social problems that emerged late last year. These troubles
 provoked a strong political reaction that emboldened critics of Deng's
 plans. Through a delicate combination of compromise, careful timing, and
 political craftiness, however, Deng succeeded in placating his formidable
 opponents with comparatively minor gestures while scoring lasting gains.
 The most visible price of Deng's success was acceptance of the arguments
 of those, particularly in the military, who were alarmed over the unforeseen
 consequences of the party's drift toward pragmatism. Deng yielded to
 hardline sentiment on questions of social order and the need for "spiritual"
 exhortation as well as "material" incentives to motivate the populace.
 In order to deal with disgruntled elements in the military, Deng was also
 forced to take over chairmanship of the party's Military Commission only a
 year after voluntarily giving up his position as chief of staff. Before the ple-
 num, Deng successfully pressed the Army to accept his choice for Minister
 of Defense and the second budget cut in less than a year, but he could not
 arrange for Hu Yaobang to succeed Hua Guofeng as Chairman of the
 Military Commission.
 Moreover, the difficulties encountered in building a consensus for the
 plenum led to delays and confusion in implementing the reforms Deng's
 supporters had launched with great fanfare last fall. Mixed signals
 adversely affected economic performance as lower level officials waited for
 the leadership to sort out its priorities.

 In foreign affairs, the plenum reaffirmed China's anti-Soviet foreign
 policy. It also approved a new, more nationalistic line that demonstrated
 particular sensitivity over the Taiwan issue.
 Deng and his allies are in a race against time to demonstrate the success of
 their reforms. They still face resistance in the party and Army from
 numerous officeholders who gained their positions during Mao's Cultural
 Revolution. Hu, moreover, is personally unpopular among segments of the
 Army and populace. Despite the gains made at the plenum, this opposition
 could still provoke a confrontation that might frustrate achievement of
 Deng's goals.
 Before the 12th Party Congress next year, Deng and his allies will seek to
 consolidate their gains further, although with a caution nurtured in the six
 months of delicate politicking that led to the Sixth Plenum.

 The Chinese Communist
 Party's Sixth Plenum:
 Deng Firms His Gri
 Introduction
 The Sixth Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party's
 1 1 th Central Committee, held 27-29 June, has further
 strengthened Deng Xiaoping and his reformist allies
 in their continuing struggle with well-entrenched left-
 ist and orthodox elements in the party and military.
 Deng's approach to the plenum was marked by a
 combination of compromise, careful timing, and po-
 litical craftiness-tactics that enabled him to score
 important gains in key appointments and ideology
 while placating his formidable opponents with com-
 paratively less significant concessions.
 After an enlarged Politburo meeting in May and an
 expanded work conference of the Central Committee
 in mid-June, the Sixth Plenum "unanimously"
 endorsed:
 ? Promotion of Deng's longtime protege Hu Yaobang
 to the party chairmanship.
 ? Demotion in disgrace of former Chairman Hua
 Guofeng to the most junior vice chairmanship.
 ? Appointment of Deng Xiaoping as Chairman of the
 party's Military Commission.
 ? Promotion of Premier Zhao Ziyang to fourth-rank-
 ing position on the Politburo Standing Committee.
 ? "The Resolution on Certain Questions in the Histo-
 ry of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's
 Republic of China," a document that both praised
 and criticized Mao Zedong.
 ? Appointment of Deng-loyalist Xi Zhon xun to part
 secretary in charge of legal affairs.
 The Campaign Against Hua
 The changes in personnel announced at the Sixth
 Plenum cap the five-year effort by Deng and his
 supporters to remold the party's top leadership. Oust-
 ing Hua Guofeng from the three important posts he
 obtained just before and after Mao Zedong's death
 remained Deng's key objective all along; by removing
 Hua as Premier, Chairman of the party Central
 Committee, and Chairman of the party Military
 Commission, Deng has positioned his followers to
 prepare an eventual succession to Deng's authority in
 order to ensure the continuity of his policies.
 Deng has used "salami tactics" to achieve his ends
 against tremendous odds. At the watershed Third
 Plenum in December 1978, he arranged to have the
 party declare an end to the period of large-scale "class
 struggle," thus effectively rewriting the ideology un-
 derpinning the position of Hua Guofeng and other
 beneficiaries of the Cultural Revolution. At the same
 time, Deng succeeded in adding four members to the
 Politburo, including the independent-minded veteran
 leader and Vice Chairman Chen Yun, who has proved
 a major Deng ally at crucial moments, and Hu
 Yaobang, who assumed the powerful positions of       25
 party secretary general and director of the Propagan-
 da Department
 Deng again advanced the positions of his followers at
 the Fourth and Fifth Plenums in 1979 and 1980. In
 1980, Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang moved onto the
 Politburo Standing Committee, the most powerful
 body in the party. The reformers weakened Hua's
 position by removing from the Politburo four left-
 leaning beneficiaries of the Cultural Revolution. The
 party's reestablishment of the party Secretariat, de-
 stroyed during the Cultural Revolution, and the selec-
 tion of General Secretary Hu Yaobang as its head
 also sharpl limited Hua's role in the party's day-to-
 day work.
 Hua's slide accelerated in September 1980 when the
 Third Session of the Fifth National People's Congress
 approved Zhao Ziyang as Premier in place of Hua.
 Three months later the Politburo-after meeting for
 nine sessions-decided to remove Hua from the chair-
 manships of the party and its Military Commission.
 In his stead, Hu Yaobang was chosen to be party
 chairman.
 By late December 1980, it appeared that Deng had
 effectively cut Hua out of the leadership

 Deng Xiaoping, China's domi-
 nant political figure, and his
 heir apparent, new party Chair-
 man Hu Yaobang at the Sixth
 Plenu
 A central work conference was
 set for late December, and its agenda was widely
 expected to deal with Hua, as well as to approve a
 critical assessment of Mao Zedong intended to shed
 the party of his radical ideological legacy.
 The December Work Conference-A Very Cold Wind
 By the standard that Deng prizes most-the place-
 ment of his people in key jobs-the December work
 conference of the Central Committee was a qualified
 success, but his moves provoked a strong reaction that
 was reinforced by broader problems in the economy
 and society. Deng's game plan for the work confer-
 ence went awry when the meeting unexpectedly fo-
 cused on the economy. Essentially, Deng's opponents
 sensed his weakness on economic and social issues.
 Deng's earlier moves against Hua had already made
 the political climate surrounding the conference tense.
 The stakes were high; Cultural Revolution holdovers
 believed that Deng's seizure of the levers of control
 would ultimately lead to their political eclipse. Just as
 important, orthodox party leaders who were alarmed
 by the disarray in Poland because of the experiment
 with reform were inclined to slow the pace of change
 to avoid similar disorders. Finally, the trial of the
 Gang of Four-then under way-had sharpened dif-
 ferences within the party over the legacy of Mao,
 whose name was dragged into the courtroom defense
 by his widow Jiang Qing despite the regime's elabo-
 rate measures to prevent that occurrence.
 On the face of it, the decision to stress economic
 readjustment in December was a setback for Deng,
 who had launched his ambitious reform program only
 a few months earlier. Even so, Deng and the reform-
 ers, who won the support of Chen Yun on economic
 questions, were able to cushion their acceptance of
 some responsibility for exacerbating the economy's

 difficulties by blaming China's longtime economic
 planners for the fundamental problems of the econo-
 my. Indeed, Deng and his group took the offensive
 against their critics by charging them with "left
 deviationism." Party Vice Chairman Li Xiannian and
 the "petroleum faction," so called because of its grip
 larly vulnerable on this score-a weakness evident
 albeit not eliminate, their power.
 In spite of the strong political shudder sent through
 China by the work conference, Deng came out ahead.
 Hua had been relieved of all but
 the ceremoma responsibilities of the party chairman-
 ship. Hu Yaobang was to assume his duties until the
 Sixth Plenum formalized the change; Deng Xiaoping
 took over the Military Commission's work.
 The price of Deng's success was acceptance of some of
 the arguments of those, particularly in the military,
 who were alarmed over unforeseen cgriseauences of
 the party's drift toward pragmatism
 The results of the conference, moreover, affected
 Deng's policy goals directly by endorsing the stringent
 cutbacks in investment and delays in implementing
 economic reforms that had been mandated earlier by
 the Politburo
 China's economic circumstances clearly added weight
 to the political pressures on Deng and the reformers to
 go along with the orthodox policies of the central work
 inflation on the previous Chinese regime, news that
 inflation rates ran 10-15 percent late last year
 since they included the newly established bonuses that
 were an integral though frequently mishandled part of
 the policy of "material incentives." The effect of
 shocked the party leadership into endorsing drastic
 cuts in state expenditures. The cuts carried political
 consequences for Deng's economic reform program,
 reducing spending on capital construction and closing
 inefficient factories also promised to add to the
 regime's already serious unemployment problem-a
 prospect that entailed the need to consider new meas-
 ures to maintain social order.
 The turnabouts in reform policy and in the top party
 leadership evoked strong reactions. Liberal elements
 in the Chinese political spectrum felt sold out because
 of the reduced emphasis on reform of party, state, and
 economic structures and the inroads into material
 incentives by hoary appeals for self-sacrifice. Left-
 leaning and orthodox opinion objected to the bum's
 rush treatment of Hua Guofeng, particularly in the
 face of the credit accorded him in helping to oust the
 Gang of Four in 1976. These groups also sensed that 25
 they could exploit an apparently fragile leadership
 consensus to roll back even more of Deng's pragmatic
 initiatives since the Third Plenum, including criticism
 of Mao, cadre rectification, and the dismantling of the  25
 commune system.                                          25
 Trouble With Hua Guofeng
 The Sixth Plenum eventually confirmed Hua Guo-
 feng's fall from grace, but only after more than six
 months of wrangling. Crosscurrents in the Chinese         2
 media about Hua's removal as the party Chairman
 during the December work conference suggest that
 Deng was compelled to push hard against resistance
 from Hua's supporters. The specific circumstances
 behind Deng's trouble with Hua remain unclear, but 25
 it appears that Hua changed his mind in December
 and decided not to cooperate in his own ouster.
 According to the Hong Kong leftist press, Hua openly
 displayed his unhappiness through his refusal to at-
 tend public ceremonies intended to demonstrate lead-
 ership "unity." In the Chinese political culture a
 withdrawal of this sort amounts to a call for political
 support. The specific rationale behind Hua's move is
 unknown, although it seems likely that he wanted to
 use his remaining leverage to bargain for power and
 status in his reduced role as a vice chairman

 Pictured are Chen Yun, Deng Xiaoping, Hu Yaobang, Li Xiannian,

 collegial atmosphere in the Politburo's standing committee. Miss-
 ranking leader Ye Jianying, elements in the People's
 Liberation Army (PLA), and lower level cadres who
 profited from the Cultural Revolution. As Mao's
 ostensible heir, Hua was the rallying point for those
 threatened by Deng and his policies. Public appear-
 ances by Hua in his capacity as chairman on two
 occasions during 1981 seemed to signal an under-
 standing with his enemies over his fate, and there
 were anomalies in the media that suggested he would
 be demoted. Some stories recounted wrangling over
 plenum asserted that notwithstanding his contribution
 to the arrest of the Gang of Four-a principal point
 offered by Hua's supporters-Hua had:
 ? Promoted the erroneous "two whatevers," a code-
 phrase for uncritically upholding whatever Mao said
 or did.
 Tried to suppress discussion of the "criterion of
 truth," Deng's main ideological theme.

 treatment of the Tiananmen incident in 1976 that
 toppled Deng.

 as late as the preplenum work conference in June=
 While some in Deng's group may have tried to force
 Hua all the way out of the party's senior ranks, at no
 point did Deng appear to seek Hua's complete ouster
 from the top leadership. Whatever Hua hoped to
 obtain from his maneuvering, in the end he lost big.
 The original agreement to reduce him to vice chair-
 man held, and he reportedly retains no real power as
 number seven-the last-on the Politburo Standing
 Committee. Moreover, the Sixth Plenum's Resolu-
 tion, which was used by Deng's forces to place Hua's
 past errors on record with those of Mao himself, has
 left Hua with only a veneer of respectability. The

 The Resolution concluded: "Obviously under his lead-
 ership it is impossible to correct left errors within the
 party, and all the more impossible to restore the
 party's fine traditions." Permitted to decide for him-
 self whether to make a self-criticism, Hua reluctantly
 made a brief statement that fell short of a full self-
 criticism during the preplenum work conference.

 Hua's Fate and Ye Jianying:
 The Old Marshal's Last Stand
 The views and actions of senior party Vice Chairman
 Ye Jianying, de facto head of state as Chairman of
 the National People's Congress Standing Committee
 and an "old marshal" held in perhaps the highest
 esteem by the military, complicated the infighting
 over Hua's fate and helped drag out the process of
 demoting him. After participating in the November-
 December 1980 Politburo meetings that originally
 decided on Hua's removal, Ye returned to his native
 southern China, ostensibly to escape the cold northern
 winter as he has for years. The timing of Ye's
 departure and his subsequent public behavior, how-
 ever, suggested that the old man was unhappy about
 both the treatment of Hua and Den 's rogressive de-
 Maoization
 Ye has repeatedly absented himself from Politburo
 activity to protest and signal his disagreement with
 party decisions-an action even taken to demonstrate
 support for Deng Xiaoping in 1976. Given Ye's great
 prestige and network of supporters particularly in the
 Army, he is not a man Deng can afford to defy
 directly. Deng and his allies have, therefore, learned
 to work around Ye during his absences, albeit at least
 seeking his acquiescence in key decisions. In 1980, for
 example, Ye's unhappiness over the rehabilitation of
 former President Liu Shaoqi led to a delay of several
 months in the formal ceremonies, which Ye ultimate-
 ly did not attend.
 The removal of Hua from the chairmanship seems to
 have similarly rankled Ye. Although the party has
 circulated documents including Ye's lukewarm en-
 dorsement of decisions reached at the plenum, the fact

 At the conference, both Hua and Army General
 Political Department Director Wei Guoqing ex-
 pressed misgivings about the use of material incen-
 tives, since soldiers, who do not ordinarily produce
 saleable goods and services, were unlikely to share in
 such benefits. Numerous press reports have subse-
 quently described the party's efforts to reassure sol-
 diers that the dismantling of the commune system
 would not cause disproportionate hardships for mili-
 tary families. The subject remains sensitive, however,
 and directions have been issued to ensure that local
 pendents, who were previously looked after by the
 communes. Years of political indoctrination centered
 on Mao have made the military a bastion of Maoism.
 In addition, many soldiers are concerned that Deng's
 reduction in force and push for upgrading of skills
 within the People's Liberation Army will mean de-
 mobilization and a return to the hard life of the

 ter, Geng Biao, on reluctant senior officers. The PLA
 was required to accept a major budget cut in Febru-
 ary, only six months after unhappily agreeing to a
 13-percent reduction in its budget. He has also over-
 seen a new large troop demobilization and the estab-
 lishment of new, higher recruitment standards. Pres-
 sure, meanwhile, is growing on disgruntled senior
 officers to retire.
 Deng's tactics in implementing his policies highlight
 the importance and difficulty of the tasks. As a case
 in point, he has taken on the job of Military Commis-
 sion chairman himself despite his oft-stated intention
 tional provision according the job to the party chair-
 man. There are also signs that Deng is attempting to
 impose an intermediate level of governmental control
 between the PLA's top ranks and the party leaders
 in effect, a buffer that would depoliticize and stabilize
 the Army's links to the party. Prior to the Sixth
 Plenum, for example, the National People's Congress
 Standing Committee issued instructions on military
 discipline, a function long reserved to the military's
 political commissars.
 For his part, Deng has enlisted Hu Yaobang in the
 effort to find some modus vivendi with the military.
 Because Hu's reformist zeal has made him personally
 unpopular in Army ranks-a factor that may well
 have prevented his selection as the Military Commis-
 sion chairman-he has in recent months made several
 overtures to the military.
 Deng's push to remove Hua was designed in part to
 give Hu Yaobang time in the job to build a personal
 following within the military under Deng's protection.
 Hu's success with the Army will be a key indicator of
 his staying power. 1            -1
 Despite Deng's hard-won victories in dealing with
 military opponents, his problems are still not over.
 Army General Political Department Director and
 Politburo member Wei Guoqing, for example, has
 assumed a spokesman's role for left-leaning officials
 who are concerned with the activities of dissident
 intellectuals. Wei, who apparently supported both
 Hua and a kinder verdict on Mao, will likely become a
 rallying point for some of Deng's opponents. Indeed,
 media articles suggest that some members of the
 military are unwilling to accept the Resolution's
 judgment on Hua despite an intense propaganda
 effort to build support for the document's conclusions.
 The Resolution on Party History
 "The Resolution on Certain Historical Questions"
 stands alongside Hu Yaobang's promotion as one of
 the major products of the Sixth Plenum. After 15
 months of argument and compromise, the plenum
 endorsed a document that ideologically supports
 Deng's pragmatic approach through a revamped party
 line. The Resolution also provides a new political
 baseline for the reformers' use in making future
 changes in policy and personnel
 Approved For Release 2007/05/14: CIA-RDP03TO2547R000100100001-0
 Mao's own leftist mistakes constitute the heart of the
 Resolution's critique. The document handles the sen-
 sitive issue of Mao's role by weighing his achieve-
 ments through the mid-1950s against his later fail-
 ures-a format in accord with Deng Xiaoping's public
 statements that Mao's contributions are greater than
 Wei Guoqing, Politburo member and director of
 the Army's General Political Department, at the
 Sixth Plenum.
 The Resolution sharply repudiates the legacy of Mao
 Zedong's later years, the Cultural Revolution, and
 other aspects of party history that form the basis of
 leftist critiques of current policies. It does, however,
 carefully preserve enough of Mao's reputation to
 prevent a sweeping condemnation that could under-
 mine the regime's legitimacy. The Resolution ad-
 dresses sensitive-and heretofore avoided-periods in
 the party's past and makes definitive judgment on
 them. It also presents a credible but highly critical
 evaluation of the party's history long sought by
 moderates within the party and intellectuals outside
 it.
 Leftists are the clear losers in the document. The
 Resolution scores "leftism" as a deviation from Marx-
 ism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and details
 leftist errors in economics and politics during the
 Great Leap Forward, the 1960-62 "period of natural
 disasters," and the Cultural Revolution. The assess-
 ment declares that leftism undermined the morale of
 the party and led to the eclipse of party traditions like
 democratic centralism. Finally, the Resolution repudi-
 ates the leftist line of the Ninth, 10th, and 1 1 th
 Congresses
 his errors.
 The Resolution nonetheless is firm in its condemna-
 tion of Mao's later years. The document asserts that
 Mao began to stray from the mainstream of the party
 and his own principles after the benchmark Eighth
 Party Congress in 1956, which established policies
 that closely resemble those of today's leaders. In the
 process, it criticized Mao for failing to heed the
 Congress' decision to concentrate on economic devel-
 opment. The document acknowledges, for the first
 time, that Mao initiated the disastrous Cultural Revo-
 lution. In attacking Mao's personal leadership style-
 something orthodox leaders had lobbied against-the
 Resolution echoes the sentiments earlier expressed by
 Deng and asserts that in his later years Mao was
 unable to correct his errors.
 The Resolution presents a positive, upbeat view of the
 party's future, praising Deng Xiaoping by name. It
 heartily approves of post-Third Plenum policies and
 argues that the party has put the Cultural Revolution
 behind it and is a healthy and vital institution capable
 of modernizing the country. In this respect, the
 document emphasizes political unity, collective lead-
 ership, and limited democracy.
 Deng's political skill was vital in steering the docu-
 ment through the plenum debate. Argument was
 apparently prolonged by considerable disagreement
 over the 1958-65 period, when many who are in power
 today, including Deng himself, acquiesced in Mao's
 early leftist policies. Deng engineered a face-saving
 compromise that shared blame for the errors of that
 period and thereby overcame obstacles to a final
 draft. Deng probably had to restrain his own support-
 ers who pushed for removal of all references to Mao
 or his thought in books and public places, threatening
 to unhorse the hard-won compromise
 Controversy lingers despite the air of finality that
 surrounds the Resolution. Both the document's ideo-
 logical findings and its treatment of Mao will remain

 On the early Mao: Our party and people would have
 had to grope in the dark much longer had it not been
 for Comrade Mao Zedong, who more than once
 rescued the Chinese Revolution from grave
 danger....
 On the later Mao: While making serious mistakes, he
 repeatedly urged the whole party to study the works
 of Marx, Engels, and Lenin conscientiously and
 imagined that his theory and practice were Marxist
 and that they were essential for the consolidation of
 the dictatorship of the proletariat. Herein lies his
 tragedy.
 On the Cultural Revolution: History has shown that
 the Cultural Revolution, initiated by a leader labor-
 ing under a misapprehension and capitalized on by
 counterrevolutionary cliques, led by domestic turmoil
 and brought catastrophe to the party, the state, and
 the whole people.
 -Chief responsibility for the grave "left" error of the
 Cultural Revolution, an error comprehensive in mag-
 nitude and protracted in duration, does indeed lie
 with Comrade Mao Zedong.
 Theses of the Cultural Revolution: They were incor-
 porated into a general theory-the "theory of contin-
 ued revolution under the dictatorship of the proletar-
 iat" -which then took on a specific meaning. These
 erroneous "left" theses, upon which Comrade Mao
 Zedong based himself in initiating the "Cultural
 Revolution," were obviously inconsistent with the
 system of Mao Zedong Thought, which is the integra-
 tion of the universal principles of Marxism-Leninism
 with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution.
 These theses must be thoroughly distinguished from
 Mao Zedong Thought.
 On the removal of Hua as party Chairman: Obvious-
 ly, under his leadership it is impossible to correct
 "left" errors within the party, and all the more
 impossible to restore the party's fine traditions.
 On Deng and the Tiananmen Incident: In April of the
 same year (1976), a powerful movement of protest
 signaled by the Tiananmen Incident swept the whole
 country, a movement to mourn for the late Premier
 Zhou Enlai and oppose the Gang of Four. In essence,
 the movement was a demonstration of supportfor the
 party's correct leadership as represented by Deng
 Xiaoping.
 controversial. On the one hand, conservatives and
 elements in the PLA are unhappy with the negative
 assessment of much of the party's recent history. On
 the other, intellectuals, one of the major audiences for
 the Resolution, may not accept its distinctions be-
 tween Mao and the Gang of Four or between Mao
 and the party. For many, Mao was the party, and the
 party still remains deeply suspect.
 Because of its complexity, length, and calculated
 ambiguity on specific issues, the Resolution remains
 open to interpretation. Each faction withi

 Prospects
 Since the 11th Party Congress in 1977, Deng Xiao-
 ping has steadily consolidated his position despite a
 Politburo and Central Committee that were initially
 stacked against him. Deng's need to court those
 bodies frequently has forced modifications in his
 policies and slowed his effort to place his followers in
 secure positions to succeed him; it has not, however,
 stalled his political momentum. By tailoring policies
 to accommodate the sensitivities about signs of social
 disorder,and acting to remedy shortcomings in eco-
 nomic policy, Deng has kept the political initiative in
 his hands.
 Like Deng's tactics after the Third Plenum, the
 tentatively scheduled for early next year-are likely
 to bring a revived political offensive by the reformers.
 opposition in the Politburo, push for reforms, and
 prepare a campaign to neutralize left-leaning cadres
 reformers are likely to continue the more cautious
 approach that has been evident in their attempt to
 rebuild the leadership consensus since the reverses of
 and bolster the gains already made may slow efforts
 in government, party, and economic institutions.
 Still, the reformers appear to have an agenda-
 largely hidden-for eventual changes that they be-
 lieve are required to prevent a return to political and
 economic disruption
 The Economy. As in the last six months, troubles over
 economic policy will continue to cloud the political
 future. The leadership needs concrete economic plans
 that will mesh with the plenum's endorsement of the
 break with past economic policy and buoy its sagging
 image among the Chinese people. Debate nevertheless
 persists over the relative weight to assign to readjust-
 ment and reform; powerful figures who favor central
 planning and heavy industry remain in key positions
 where they have repeatedly obstructed the reformers'
 attempts to redirect the economy. Given the political-
 ly costly false starts and mixed signals that have
 plagued the economy so far, Deng's coalition will try
 to use its success at the plenum to forge a working
 consensus on economic policy.l
 "Institutional Reform. " Deng and his allies see the
 party's efforts to reform itself and the government as
 the keys to long-term stability. The reformers' public
 line repeatedly emphasizes that China's institutions
 must change to prevent backsliding toward the pat-
 terns of personal rule, which led to Mao's errors.
 Premier Zhao Ziyang is likely to take the lead in this
 area. By promoting him ahead of more senior leaders,
 the plenum removed the cloud that had hung over
 Zhao and his reform program since last winter, when
 readjustment was stressed over reform
 Approved For Release 2007/05/14: CIA-RDP03TO2547R000100100001-0
 The Politburo, the State Chairman, and the General
 Secretary. Deng and the reformers want to continue
 reshaping the Politburo and Secretariat with more
 youthful and knowledgeable leaders like Hu and
 Zhao. To that end, the reformers have so far unsuc-
 cessfully attempted to form a senior Advisory Council
 of the Politburo, where superannuated members could
 be retired. While the reformers' have nudged several
 elderly members, who in principle have surrendered
 some of their government jobs, into accepting advisory
 status, the effort has foundered on Ye Jianying's
 unwillingness to yield his position. Ye realizes that he
 is frequently the only serious obstacle to many of
 Deng's ambitions, including the demotion of Hua. At
 83 years and in failing health, Ye is probably viewed
 by Deng and others as a problem that time, rather
 than action, will solve
 The reformers' intention to recreate an official head-
 of-state position is less clear. The issue prompts
 concern among those who stand to lose in any redis-
 tribution of power within the leadership. Articles in
 legal journals have argued the pros and cons in recent
 months; Soong Ching-ling was made honorary head of
 state on her deathbed in May. Here again Ye Jian-
 ying's refusal to step into retirement appears to be the
 principal impediment, since he still is de facto head of
 state.
 Finally, the Sixth Plenum's failure to appoint a party
 general secretary to succeed Hu Yaobang leaves
 another ambiguity. Hu has not been publicly identi-
 fied as general secretary, although he reportedly
 retains the title since his promotion to chairman.
 Immediately before the Sixth Plenum, Xi Zhongxun
 appeared to be the candidate of Deng and Hu for the
 general secretary position. According to the Hong
 Kong leftist press, however, other leaders objected
 because Xi lacked experience on the Secretariat. He
 may well be nominated for the post again at a later
 plenum. Meanwhile, he is in charge of legal affairs
 and is maintaining a high level of appearances,
 consistent with candidacy for the higher post
 As a new and untested chairman, Hu is confronted
 with a more complex task than before, a fact that is
 likely to make him move more cautiously. He must
 extract results from a recalcitrant economy that will
 justify his pragmatic approach to the younger genera-
 tions of Chinese steeped in Maoism. He needs to
 continue the reforms he has started but not at the
 expense of alarming his critics into a unified opposi-    25
 tion. Changing roles, moreover, has made him more a
 spokesman for the regime than its critic. Recognizing
 the widespread skepticism about his promotion, Hu
 now stresses reliance on the guidance of the older
 generation of leaders, especially Deng
 Despite these inhibitions, however, Hu realizes that he
 must use the next few years under Deng's protection
 to build the political influence that will prevent him
 from becoming, like Hua, another transitional figure
 in the next Chinese succession struggle. Although the   25
 party repeatedly appeals for new democratic methods,
 the time-tested method for dealing with the o  osition
 is a ruthless and persistent purge.
