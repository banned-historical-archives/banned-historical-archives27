 India:  1-3
 Opponents Jailed
 Prime  Minister Gandhi,  who  has been
 under increasing pressure from her opponents to
 resign since her recent conviction for corrupt
 electoral practices in 1971, struck back on June
 26 by having scores of opposition leaders ar-
 rested. A presidential proclamation of national
 emergency  followed,  giving  the  government
 wide new powers.
 In a brief radio address, Mrs. Gandhi cited
 the threat of internal disturbances as the reason
 for the proclamation. The arrests were made
 under the provisions of the Maintenance of
 Internal Security Act, the language of which will
 prevent those arrested from seeking court action
 to obtain their release.
 Government critic J. P. Narayan, the aging
 one-time associate of Mahatma Gandhi in the
 independence struggle and leader of a national
 non-partisan  protest  movement,  was  among
 those jailed, as were at least two members of
 Mrs. Gandhi's own Congress Party who had
 urged her to resign. All newspaper reporting on
 internal  developments  was  brought   under
 censorship, and the editor of at least one opposi-
 tion newspaper was arrested. The radio in India
 has long been fully under government control.
 The Prime Minister's vigorous action came
 two days after a ruling by a Supreme Court
 justice that granted Mrs. Gandhi only a condi-
 tional stay of the judgment against her by a
 state court on June 12. That judgment, if it
 stands, will disbar her from holding public office
 for six years. The conditional stay allows her to
 retain the prime ministership but denies her the
 right to vote in parliament until the Supreme
 Court acts on her appeal. With parliament in
 recess, the restriction is academic, but the ruling
 further damaged Mrs. Gandhi's political posi-
 tion, which had also been hurt by her party's
 unexpected defeat in legislative elections in the
 state of Gujarat in early June.
 Sensing that they might have Mrs. Gandhi
 on the run, opposition leaders intensified their
 campaign to force her to step down. Their
 attempts to arouse the public reached a climax
 in a speech by Narayan in New Delhi on June 25
 in which he called on the army, police, and
 government employees to disobey any order
 they considered  illegal. A  nationwide "non-
 violent struggle" to force Mrs. Gandhi to resign
 was to have been launched by the combined
 opposition parties on June 29.
 Much will now depend on the leaders of
 the ruling Congress Party. The cabinet, including
 the two members most often mentioned as pos-
 sible successors to Mrs. Gandhi-Minister of
 Agriculture. Jagjivan  Ram  and  Minister  of
 Finance Y. B. Chavan-is still giving her strong
 public support. Even before the events of June
 26, however, a small group within the Con-
 gress-perhaps 25  of the 515 members                                                                                       of
 parliament-was    reported  insisting  on Mrs.
 Gandhi's resignation, and others may now take

 up the call. Her demonstrated willingness to
 take strong action in order to stay in power will
 give pause to some, however.
 Senior officers within the armed services
 apparently were taken by surprise by the proc-
 lamation of emergency. The Indian military has
 a long tradition of remaining aloof from politics
 and probably will not interfere in the present
 situation other than to assist the police in main-
 taining order, if ordered to do so.
 Mrs.  Gandhi will probably not convene
 parliament in July for its traditional summer
 session. Under the terms of the Indian constitu-
 tion,  however,  she  must  seek  parliament's
 approval of the emergency proclamation within
 two months of its date of issuance or the proc-
 lamation automatically expires. The Supreme
 Court is expected to begin a review of Mrs.
 Gandhi's appeal shortly after it reconvenes on
 July 14, and a judgment might be issued before
 the expiration of the two month period. The
 executive branch of the government, despite
 extensive powers granted  it  under the new
 emergency  proclamation,  cannot  block  the
 Supreme Court's consideration of the appeal.
 41b Laos: A Swan Song for Souvanna?
 There are unconfirmed reports that Prime
 Minister Souvanna Phouma may be planning to
 turn over leadership of the coalition government
 to his half-brother, Prince Souphanouvong, the
 nominal chief of the Lao communist movement.
 National Political Council, succeeding to the
 prime ministership is also plausible. The so-
 called "Red Prince" has long been considered
 Souvanna's heir apparent, and he enjoys a na-
 tional  following  second  only  to  that  of
 Souvanna.
 Souvanna reportedly plans to accompany the
 King only as far as Paris, with the King and his
 royal  entourage  continuing  on  to  Moscow,
 Peking,  and  Hanoi  for  official  state visits.
 Recent press reports from Vientiane have also
 mentioned the possibility of a midsummer trip
 abroad by Souvanna and the King.
 The  reports  of  Souvanna's        impending
 retirement from active political life are plausi-
 ble. The coalition government is now dominated
 by the Lao communists, leaving Souvanna a
 virtually powerless figurehead. Moreover, the
 Prime Minister is nearly 74 years old and his
 health is failing; these physical factors alone
 argue  strongly for retirement.  It is unclear
 whether Souvanna plans to go into permanent
 political exile in France or return to the retire-
 ment home he has built in the royal Lao capital
 of Luang Prabang.
 The notion of Souphanouvong, currently
 serving as chairman  of the coalition's Joint

 Angola: Another Truce
 The leaders of the three rival liberation
 groups  in  Angola's  transitional  government
 signed a new coexistence agreement last week,
 after six days of talks in Kenya. It is intended to
 forestall all-out civil war and to preserve the
 transitional regime  until  the  country gains
 independence next November. Its effectiveness
 is questionable, however, inasmuch as the new
 accord  is little more than a restatement of
 earlier agreements that the liberation groups
 have failed to honor. Elements of the two major
 groups engaged  in sporadic skirmishing even
 while their leaders were meeting, and new fight-
 ing erupted in Luanda, Angola's capital, on June
 24.
 The  three  leaders-Holden  Roberto,
 Agostinho Neto, and Jonas Savimbi-agreed to
 release prisoners held by their respective organi-
 zations-the National Front for the Liberation
 of Angola, the Popular Movement for the Liber-
 ation of Angola, and the National Union for the
 Total Independence of Angola. They also agreed
 to disarm the civilian population and to speed
 up the formation of a national army composed
 of troops from the three groups. In addition,
 they reaffirmed their commitment to hold na-
 tional elections to a constituent assembly by the
 end of October. The assembly is to select a head
 of  government  who  will  assume  office on
 independence day, November 11.
 Effective implementation of the truce rests
 on the slim chance that Roberto's group and
 U
 Neto's organization-the main antagonists-will
 refrain from further attacks on each other. The
 most recent wave of fighting between them left
 the Popular Movement in control in several areas
 north of Luanda, severely limiting the National
 Front's access to the city. The Popular Move-
 ment's advantage could spark Roberto into call-
 ing for further military action before being cut
 off entirely from the city.
 A weakness in the agreement itself is its
 provision for the ministries of information and
 justice to lead the campaign to disarm civilians.
 Both  these ministries are controlled by the
 Popular Movement, the group most responsible
 for having armed civilians. These armed civilians
 have proved a valuable auxiliary for the Popular
 Movement in areas where its regular military
 force has been outnumbered by troops of the
 National Front. If the Popular Movement hesi-
 tates  to  move  quickly  to  disarm  civilians,
 Roberto might try to force the issue with his
 own troops.
 The leaders also agreed to guarantee the
 right of political activity for all three groups
 throughout the territory. The National Front
 and the  Popular  Movement,  however, have
 established unchallenged control over areas in
 which they have tribal links, and any future
 political activity in those areas by a rival group
 is virtually certain to provoke serious fighting.

 PORTUGAL: MODERATES ENCOURAGED
 Moderate political parties in Portugal are
 seeking to ensure that the momentum generated
 by the moderate tone of the policy statement
 issued by the ruling Revolutionary Council on
 June 21 continues in their favor.
 The Council's statement was a hard-fought
 compromise resulting from eight days of deliber-
 ations. The effect on the fortunes of political
 moderates may be more far reaching than the
 wording  of the communique indicates. The
 Revolutionary Council reaffirmed its commit-
 ment to political parties and to the establish-
 ment of a pluralistic system. At the same time,
 however, it reiterated support for the formation
 of grassroots organizations tied to the Armed
 Forces Movement that will be the "embryo of
 an experimental system of direct democracy."

 Socialist Party demonstration in support of the Revolutionary Council's policy statement

 The Council judges Portugal to be in a
 transitional phase of its revolutionary process,
 with political parties necessary to help educate
 the population. The statement does not project
 the parties' future role, but conceivably this
 may be diminished in subsequent states in the
 building of a "classless society," if popular com-
 mittees are created according to the Movement's
 wishes.
 Moderates are particularly encouraged by
 the harsh treatment of radical left-wing groups
 that threatened public order during the past few
 days. The Council promised to take strong ac-
 tions against extremists and did so, the day the
 statement was released, by breaking up a group
 protesting the jailing of several members last
 month. The Council also assured the existence

 Approved For Release 2007/12/04: CIA-RDP79-00927A011100070001-3
 of non-socialist  opposition  parties-like  the
 right-of-center  Social  Democratic   Center-as
 long as they support the Movement's goal of
 constructing a socialist society.
 The decision to support the existence of
 political parties should temporarily silence those
 radical  officers who have supported popular
 councils formed by the far left and who have
 proposed abolishing parties as well as the con-
 stituent assembly. A list of "recommendations"
 favoring a "speeded up revolutionary process"
 was formally presented to the Revolutionary
 Council last month, pushed by elements of the
 internal security forces, led by security chief
 Otelo de Carvalho.
 The  security  troops  have  grown  in-
 creasingly independent and, although the ma-
 jority is probably not radical, the minority has
 openly taken sides in theRepublica dispute. The
 troops allowed Communist workers to enter the
 newspaper offices and  denied  access to the
 Socialist management, despite the announced
 government policy to treat both sides equally.
 Last week they were also reluctant to protect
 from extremist attack Catholic demonstrators
 demanding that the church-owned radio station
 be turned back to its legal owners.
 The policy statement rebuked the security
 troops by prohibiting all partisan political activ-
 ity by the military. Reports of possible attempts
 by radical elements to oust moderates and as-
 sume control over the Movement have probably
 been discouraged by the moderates' show of
 strength in the Revolutionary Council. Rumors
 of  Carvalho's  impending dismissal,  however,
 have been repudiated by the Council's affirma-
 tion of his promotion to commander of the
 internal security forces, a position that had been
 officially held by President Costa Gomes.
 The  communique,  while          acknowledging
 economic problems and administrative lethargy,
 did not address itself to concrete issues like the
 Republica and Radio Renascenca disputes.
 Soon after the general policy statement
 was issued, the Council resumed meeting to
 1
 tackle the conflicts in the media. The Revolu-
 tionary Council's communique did state that the
 Movement intends to exert greater control over
 the media and will take over at least one news-
 paper to ensure accurate coverage of its policies.
 The Council also gave the coalition government
 until the end of July to propose an economic
 strategy that would reverse the decline in pro-
 duction and the increase in unemployment.
 The moderates hope that forthcoming solu-
 tions on these matters will be in their favor. To
 help maintain the advantage they have gained,
 moderate  parties,  led  by  the  Socialists,
 responded enthusiastically to the communique
 and organized a demonstration on June 23 to
 show that they can mobilize the population in
 support of the Movement as effectively as the
 Communists.
 Socialist and Catholic leaders have begun
 to line up external support for their causes in a
 further attempt to influence the Movement. The
 offer of economic assistance made by various
 West European countries and organizations is
 contingent upon the survival of political parties
 in Portugal and apparently served to strengthen
 the arguments of moderates last week in the
 Revolutionary Council. A major portion of the
 Council's statement dealt with economic prob-
 lems, and Movement members appear to be
 aware that the best hope of help lies in Western
 Europe.

 SPAIN: ARIAS REAFFIRMS GOALS
 In a major policy speech to the Spanish
 parliament on June 24, Prime Minister Arias
 reiterated his determination to follow through
 on the liberalization  program he announced
 shortly after his appointment 18 months ago
 and promised new measures to increase popular
 participation  in government. He came down
 hardest, however, on the need for law and order
 as a prerequisite for orderly political develop-
 ment. On balance, conservatives will find the
 views expressed by Arias more to their liking
 than will the liberals, but neither group will be
 fully satisfied.
 Arias defended his program as a basis for
 creating a national consensus under the monar-
 chy of Prince Juan Carlos, Franco's designated
 heir. Arias' praise of the Prince exceeded his
 references to Franco, whom he treated almost as
 if he were already a figure of history. He shed
 no light on when the transfer of power would
 take place, however. The extensive praise for
 Juan Carlos may also have been intended as a
 slap at the Prince's exiled father, Don Juan of
 Borbon, who recently renewed his claim to the
 throne.
 The Prime Minister pointed to the out-
 lawed Communist Party as the greatest obstacle
 to a smooth transition after Franco goes. Arias
 announced that before the end of the year, he
 would send to the parliament a special draft law
 on combating communism. The law will prob-
 ably lead to harsher police action against the
 Communists and their allies in the underground
 trade union movement and in the Communist-
 dominated Democratic Junta, which was formed
 in Paris last July and now operates clandestinely
 in Spain.
 Arias  also  condemned  separatist move-
 ments, especially those in the troubled northern
 Basque provinces.  He defended the state of
 emergency with its added police powers that
 was imposed on two Basque provinces on April
 25 and gave no indication when the emergency
 decree would be lifted. On a conciliatory note,
 he promised that his government will propose
 regional development plans that could meet
 some of the grievances of the separatists.
 The Prime Minister singled out the armed
 forces for special praise, noting their stability,
 moderation, and acceptance of responsibility to
 guarantee the protection of the present institu-
 tions of government and order. He also credited
 the armed forces for exercising "prudence and
 courage" in the Sahara by not giving in to
 provocations and threats-his only reference to
 foreign affairs in the entire speech.
 Arias rejected the call of radicals for a new
 constitution, saying reforms can be made by
 amending the present basic laws. He referred
 again to improved prospects for greater popular
 participation in government through creation of
 political associations. Admitting that the project
 had aroused opposition, Arias announced he
 would  remove some restrictions on political
 associations and will permit them to participate
 in the parliamentary election this fall. The
 impact of this measure is blunted, however, by
 the fact that only one fifth of the 565 members
 are elected directly.
 Arias also cited the appointment last week
 of Jose Solis Ruiz as minister-secretary general
 of the National Movement as a boost for associa-
 tionism. Solis, Arias noted, was one of the orig-
 inal advocates of associations. Despite his posi-
 tive remarks about Solis, the Prime Minister is
 probably still unhappy about the appointment.
 Solis, an ambitious politician who has been men-
 tioned as a future prime minister, reportedly
 was appointed by Franco against Arias' wish.
 1-he Prime Minister dealt only briefly with
 Spain's serious economic and labor problems,
 promising major tax reforms and citing the re-
 cently adopted right-to-strike law as evidence of
 the government's concern with  labor. Arias
 avoided any mention of such current issues as
 the conflict with the church on political and
 social policies, university problems, youth, and
 censorship-all of which he discussed in some
 detail  in  his  maiden  speech  in  February
 1974.

 CSCE: QUALIFIED YES TO A SUMMIT     12-1,50
 The question of whether the European
 security conference will be capped by a summit-
 level finale in July remains unanswered. Soviet
 party leader Brezhnev last week sent letters to
 the heads of major Western countries proposing
 that the summit be held in Helsinki on July 22.
 The foreign ministers of the EC Nine responded
 on June 24 with a very qualified "yes." They
 stated that it is "desirable and possible" to hold
 the summit at the end of July-if a number of
 outstanding issues can be resolved quickly.
 In the past month, Soviet concessions have
 made it possible for many substantive problems
 to be resolved, particularly those concerning
 increased East-West contacts and exchanges of
 information. This week, the Western and Soviet
 delegations agreed on a clause protecting Allied
 rights in Germany and Berlin, another point of
 contention. The representatives of the neutral
 states must still concur with the text, but it is
 likely that they will do so.
 There are still several other major issues yet
 to be resolved, including military-related con-
 fidence-building  measures-particularly  one
 dealing with advance notification of military
 maneuvers-and the type and frequency of fol-
 low-on meetings to the conference. The West
 Europeans have insisted that these problems
 must be resolved before they give final agree-
 ment to the summit. They believe that Mos-
 cow's desire to have a summit in July will lead
 the Soviets to make concessions.
 The issue of providing advance notice of
 maneuvers will  likely  be resolved by com-
 promise. The East and West will probably split
 their differences on how much advance notice
 must be provided and on the size and location
 of the maneuvers that will be affected.
 port a Danish proposal calling for senior officials
 to meet in the second half of 1977 to assess how
 the conference's decisions have been  imple-
 mented. A preparatory meeting could be held
 two months earlier. In addition, the EC states
 agree that there can be ad hoc meetings of
 experts, provided there is a consensus among the
 participants to convene such meetings.
 The Soviets apparently want fairly fre-
 quent meetings, in which all aspects of detente
 and the state of bilateral and multilateral re-
 lations are examined. At the same time, how-
 ever, Moscow does not want to be held ac-
 countable  for  implementation  of  the  con-
 ference's decisions. The Soviets also hope to
 obtain an eventual commitment to another, full-
 scale European security conference. The con-
 ferees are trying to reach a compromise, but
 resolving differences may prove difficult and
 time-consuming.
 THE EC FOREIGN MINISTERS SAID IT
 IS  "DESIRABLE AND POSSIBLE" TO
 HOLD THE SUMMIT AT THE END OF
 JULY IF A NUMBER OF OUTSTANDING
 ISSUES CAN BE RESOLVED QUICKLY.
 Another possible stumbling block to a July
 summit is the Turkish demand that the Turkish
 Cypriot community be represented in the
 Cypriot delegation to the summit and Ankara's
 objections to the presence of President Makarios
 at Helsinki. Western delegates seriously doubt
 that Makarios can be persuaded to absent him-
 self from the summit and are hoping that the
 parties concerned can work out a solution.
 The Finns have let it be known that they
 will require four weeks' advance notice to com-
 plete preparations for a summit meeting. If
 there is to be a summit in July, the delegates in
 Geneva will be under the gun to resolve the
 East and West, however, are far apart con-
 cerning follow-on meetings. The EC Nine sup-

 GREECE: A NEW PRESIDENT
 chief of state, with Tsatsos being little more
 than a figurehead. It is generally believed that
 Karamanlis will move up to the presidency in a
 year or two, by which time internal and external
 pressures  on  the  government  may  subside.
 Karamanlis's decision not to opt for the pres-
 idency now probably stems in part from fear
 that controversy over a successor as prime min-
 ister might split his New Democracy party. The
 constitution also provides that the prime min-
 ister serve as party head, and Karamanlis is prob-
 ably unwilling at this point to give up day-to-
 day control of party affairs.
 Only  four  New  Democracy  deputies
 flouted party discipline and cast ballots for the
 opposition candidate,  former prime minister
 Kanellopoulos, who is not connected with a
 political party. Papandreou's Panhellenic Social-
 ist Movement and one wing of the Communist
 Party cast blank ballots to protest the sweeping
 powers of the presidency under the new con-
 stitution.
 Should Tsatsos eventually step down from
 the presidency  as expected,  Karamanlis will
 probably then be elected to a full five-year term
 as president. The opposition charges that this
 scheme would permit Karamanlis to maintain
 control of the government, even if his party lost
 the parliamentary election in 1978.
 Constantine Tsatsos was elected president
 of Greece last week by a parliamentary vote of
 210 to 65. He was Prime Minister Karamanlis'
 hand-picked candidate and the principal archi-
 tect of the new constitution.
 Tsatsos, a respected academician, is not
 expected to challenge Karamanlis' leadership. A
 long-time associate, he is particularly indebted
 to Karamanlis, who as prime minister in the
 early 1960s brought Tsatsos back into his cab-
 inet. Tsatsos had been out of the government
 for a year because of his involvement in a scan-
 dal over alleged improper awarding of govern-
 ment contracts.
 The new constitution creates a strong pres-
 idency and was tailor-made for Karamanlis. He
 will exercise most of the powers granted to the

 FRIENDSHIP TREATY  n   ~? ?j 3
 The signing of the Portuguese-Romanian

 rapidly improving relations between Lisbon and
 Bucharest. Romania is now markedly ahead of
 its Warsaw Pact allies in developing ties with

 the policies of the signatories and the non-
 aligned world. It also bears a striking resem-
 blance to a treaty signed by Bucharest and
 Pyongyang in late May, when North Korean
 party boss Kim 11-song visited Romania.
 Romanian President Ceausescu heralded
 the treaty as "the first of its kind between
 friendly countries that belong to different mili-
 tary blocs." Although Ceausescu and Costa
 Gomes criticized the concept and existence of
 military blocs, Ceausescu counseled moderation.
 He avoided mention of the Portuguese Com-
 munist Party  in  public.  Romania has con-
 sistently sought closer ties to the Portuguese
 socialists in preference to the Soviet-oriented
 Portuguese Communist Party.
 The communique summarizing the visit
 points out that both Portugal and Romania are
 developing nations. It stresses the need to over-
 come the gap between the developed and devel-
 oping nations and the Third World theme of
 establishing a new political and economic order
 in international relations. The communique also
 indicates that the two sides signed several trade,
 economic, and technical-scientific agreements
 and decided to establish a joint commission to
 expand economic and industrial cooperation.
 Military  contacts  between  Lisbon  and
 Bucharest also continue to expand. Colonel-
 General Coman, the Romanian chief of staff,
 visited Portugal from June 17 to 23. Coman's
 trip came four months after General Fabiao, his
 Portuguese       counterpart, visited  Romania.
 Fabiao later spoke enthusiastically about his trip
 and praised the civic action role of the Roma-
 nian army in society.

 USSR-EASTERN EUROPE: GRAIN PROSPECTS

 Because of drought in parts of the USSR's

 Barring unexpected difficulties, some 70 million

 tons more than the record in 1973.
 Record yields are likely in parts of the
 eastern New Lands area and western Siberia,

 attractive in the coming months, a result of a
 bumper US crop and generally good crop con-
 ditions throughout the world. The Soviets have
 not bought any grain this year, but deliveries
 continue  under  old  contracts.  Soviet  grain
 imports in the current fiscal year will probably
 total 6.5 million tons.
 A large grain crop this year may result in
 substantial storage losses because of the severe
 strain  on overloaded  storage  facilities. The
 Soviets are making a major effort to increase
 closed grain storage; a  massive construction
 program is under way to raise storage capacity
 by 40 million tons by 1980. This means the
 Soviets will have to add 8 million tons a year,
 more than double the annual rate between 1971
 and 1975.
 In mid-1974, the Soviet ministry of pro-
 curement reported it had off-farm storage facili-
 ties for 126 million tons of grain, of which only
 28 million tons were in grain elevators. Farms
 have the capacity for storing an estimated 100
 million tons. The construction program will rely
 primarily  on  prefabricated  concrete  silos,
 though metal silos will be included on a signifi-
 cant scale for the first time. The Soviets will
 probably purchase some equipment or designs
 from abroad.
 Major losses during recent years have been
 caused by storing newly harvested grain in huge
 outdoor piles. Grain with a moisture content of
 14 to 15 percent can usually be stored safely, as
 long as temperatures remain below 40 to 50
 degrees Fahrenheit. In certain regions of the
 USSR, however, freshly harvested grain may
 contain 25 to 35 percent moisture. If this
 moisture is not reduced by drying, the grain
 becomes moldy and deteriorates.
 Eastern Europe
 Grain  production  in  Eastern  Europe-
 excluding Yugoslavia-could reach 80 million
 tons this year, compared with 75 million in
 1974, provided the weather is favorable during
 the rest of the growing season and harvest. This
 level of output still would require grain imports
 of 8 million tons, only 5 percent less than last
 year.
 Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania-the grain
 exporters in Eastern Europe-will account for
 the jump in  output.  Spring  rains  relieved
 drought conditions in both Bulgaria and Ro-
 mania. On a visit to Bulgaria in late May, Under-
 secretary of Agriculture Campbell observed that
 the important winter wheat crop was in excel-
 lent condition, but that the corn had been
 planted late or was stunted by cool weather.
 Soil moisture level is still low in Bulgaria, and
 normal summer rainfall is needed to maximize
 crop yield.
 Crops in Romania, on the other hand, need
 hotter, dryer weather to speed development.
 Good crop conditions notwithstanding, it is un-
 likely that Bucharest's ambitious harvest tar-
 get-20 million tons-will be met. In 1972, Ro-
 mania harvested some 17 million tons of grain
 from roughly the same amount of planted area.
 Wheat and corn production in Hungary will
 probably match last year's, with a reduction in
 the area planted offset by higher yields. The
 production of barley and other grains will in-
 crease.
 Grain production in Czechoslovakia, East
 Germany, and Poland will approach the record
 harvest of last year. Because of heavy rains last
 fall, 500,000 to 600,000 hectares normally
 sown to winter wheat had to be sown with
 lower yielding spring grains. Only East Germany
 fulfilled its fall sowing plan. April rains slowed
 spring planting in Czechoslovakia, but no major
 problems were reported by East Germany or
 Poland. To boost production levels, meadows,
 pastures, and other marginal land were sown
 with spring grains, mainly barley.
 Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania will ex-
 port most of their increase in output, with the
 remainder going to replenish drought-depleted
 stocks. Czechoslovakia, East Germany, and Po-
 land, on the other hand, will account for almost  25X1
 all of the 8 million tons of grain imported,
 mainly to feed livestock. The Soviet Union and
 US will  be the principal suppliers. F

 Mozambique, a Portuguese dependency for
 over 400 years, became independent on June
 25. The date was set last September in an accord
 signed by Lisbon's new military rulers and the
 nationalist Front for the Liberation of Mozam-
 bique, which had waged guerrilla war for ten
 years.  The  Front's  leader,  Samora  Machel,
 became president of the new state.
 During the nine months that the territory
 was governed by a joint Front-Portuguese tran-
 sitional regime, it remained generally free of
 political strife. The only notable exception was
 a short-lived attempt by dissident whites and
 blacks to seize control just after the accord was
 signed. At present, the Front appears to be
 popular throughout the country; at least there
 are no signs of active opposition.
 The new government inherits a potentially
 prosperous economy, but economic activity was
 seriously disrupted by the coup in Lisbon in
 April 1974 and has not yet fully recovered. The
 coup sparked labor unrest in the territory that
 led to decreased production and revenue, infla-
 tionary wage settlements, and periodic work
 stoppages in Mozambique's major ports.
 Machel's regime will have to rely heavily on
 Portuguese advisers to sort out economic prob-
 lems. The Front lacks trained people, and its
 leaders are unfamiliar with the territory's com-
 plex economy, which was shaped for the benefit
 of Portuguese economic interests and directed
 from Lisbon. The Front will also need the co-
 operation  of  Mozambique's whites. They
 number about 200,000, out of a total popula-
 tion  of 9 million, and still  dominate the
 economy, bureaucracy, and  social services.
 Some are sympathetic to the Front.
 The new government will be under heavy
 pressure to alleviate widespread black unem-
 ployment by giving to blacks the semi-skilled
 and unskilled jobs now held by whites. These
 whites cannot afford to return to Portugual, and
 Lisbon does not really want them. Racial hostil-
 ity between the two working class groups could
 eventually become a serious problem.
 Economic necessity dictates that Mozam-
 bique's black rulers take a cautious, pragmatic
 approach toward the white minority govern-
 ments in South Africa and Rhodesia. During
 Portuguese rule, the territory earned about $200
 million annually from rail, port, and tourist
 services to South Africa and Rhodesia, and from
 the repatriated wages of some 100,000 Mozam-
 bique blacks working in South African mines.
 South  Africa, in  turn, invested  heavily  in
 Mozambique,  especially  in  the $500-million
 Cabora Bassa hydroelectric power project. A
 large share of the electricity from Cabora Bassa
 is to be sold to Pretoria beginning later this year.
 Machel  has   joined  the  presidents  of
 Tanzania,  Zambia,  and  Botswana  and with
 South African Prime Minister Vorster in an ef-
 fort to mediate between Rhodesian Prime Min-
 ister Smith and black Rhodesian nationalists.
 The four black African leaders promised the
 Rhodesian nationalists that their governments
 would eventually support efforts to bring down
 the Smith government by insurrection if nego-
 tiations failed.
 Mozambique's new leaders have been con-
 sidering applying UN economic sanctions against
 Rhodesian trade carried through the ports of
 Lourenco Marques and Beira. During the tran-
 sitional period, the Front agreed in principle to
 deny these routes unless a constitutional settle-
 ment is worked out providing for black majority
 rule in Rhodesia. Now they are under pressure
 from various quarters to follow through.
 Mozambique,  however, earns some $30
 million a year in rail and port earnings from the
 Rhodesian traffic, and Machel cannot afford to
 shut off so much income without finding an
 alternative.  In  addition,  Front leaders have
 privately reflected concern that imposing sanc-
 tions might invite Rhodesian military retalia-
 tion.

 The new government intends to pursue a
 nonaligned policy in world affairs. For a while
 at least, Portugal's influence is likely to be
 strong because of a common language and deep-
 rooted social and economic ties. Lisbon's ability
 to     offer  financial  assistance,  however,  is
 hampered by its serious economic difficulties at
 home. The USSR and China will enjoy close
 relations with  Mozambique because of their
 military assistance during the insurgency against
 Portugal. Diplomatic relations with Peking and
 Moscow will become effective upon independ-
 ence. The US, which is remembered as Lisbon's
 close ally before the coup, was not invited of-
 ficially to the independence ceremonies.
 ISRAEL: FOCUS ON THE SINAI 3,C-57
 The Israeli  u?I their attention this
 week on the prospects for another interim agree-
 ment with Egypt. As reflected in the Israeli
 press, their attitude  in general was one of
 cautious optimism that an agreement could be
 reached by the end of the summer.
 Prime Minister Rabin, however, is not as
 confident. He reportedly told a special cabinet
 session called last week to hear his report on his
 visit to the US that the odds are "less than
 50-50" for such an agreement. According to a
 recent commentary by one of Israel's best-
 informed  political  reporters, Rabin is firmly
 committed to a hard line on Israeli requirements
 for another interim agreement and will not give
 up control over the eastern ends of the Gidi and
 Mitla passes without a clear Egyptian commit-
 ment not to use force for the duration of the
 agreement.
 Rabin reportedly argues that:
 ? Retention of part of the passes is nec-
 essary as long as there is any doubt about
 Cairo's intentions, particularly with respect
 to its position in the event of Syrian-Israeli
 hostilities.
 ? He cannot reverse, in the absence of
 greater Egyptian flexibility, the position he
 took  on  the  passes  in  March  without
 destroying his credibility at home.
 ? The principle of mutuality of conces-
 sions must be preserved.
 The Prime Minister's apparent hard line
 reportedly has critics within the cabinet. The
 commentary claims "quite a few" of the min-
 isters at the special session argued that Tel Aviv
 must not allow another attempt to reach an
 interim agreement with Egypt to fail. To do so,
 they fear, would invite a confrontation with
 Washington. Although these ministers do not
 constitute a majority in the cabinet, they ap-
 parently obtained Rabin's agreement that any
 decision to break off the talks with Cairo must
 be made by the entire cabinet and not just by
 the negotiating team of Rabin, Defense Minister
 Peres, and Foreign Minister Allon.
 Rabin, however, is said to believe that
 Israel is in an excellent bargaining position be-
 cause Egypt and the US want very much to
 obtain an early agreement and is strong enough
 to live without one if its position is rejected.
 Furthermore, Rabin reportedly is convinced the
 concessions he offered in Washington make it
 impossible to accuse Israel of intransigence and
 of torpedoing the talks with Egypt. He thinks
 President Sadat will have to come up with
 appropriate concessions of his own.
 Rabin's popularity as well as that of his
 government has shown a significant increase
 over the past several months. One of Israel's
 more reliable polling organizations reported re-
 cently that almost half the people questioned
 last May believe the government has fulfilled at
 least some of the expectations they had of it
 when it took over from Mrs. Meir a year ago. To
 some extent, this reflects the sharp rise in
 Rabin's own popularity in the wake of the gov-
 ernment's firm stand last March in the nego-
 tiations for another  interim agreement with
 Egypt. Two polls published early in June in-
 dicated that almost 62 percent approved the
 Prime  Minister's  performance.

 The debate over oil nationalization took a
 new turn this week with indications that the
 governing Democratic Action Party has aban-
 doned its efforts to win opposition support for
 the petroleum bill now before the Congress.
 Instead, the government reportedly is pre-
 pared to use its majority in both houses to
 steamroller the controversial bill through, prob-
 ably in time for President Perez to make the
 historic announcement  on  July  24,  Simon
 Bolivar's birthday. During the past three weeks
 of debate, opposition continued to focus prin-
 cipally on the question of whether private oil
 companies would be allowed to participate in
 the industry after nationalization.
 Article Five of the bill, personally drafted
 by President Perez, would allow the companies
 to form "association agreements" with the gov-
 ernment. The leftist political parties for the
 most part would either totally exclude the com-
 panies or-in the case of the opposition Social
 Christian party-would limit their participation
 to selected areas and require prior congressional
 approval by a two-thirds majority.
 Although the debate is expected to drag on
 for several more weeks, political leaders seem
 reconciled to the fact that Perez will get exactly
 what he wants. As a result, some of the more
 extreme leftist political parties are attempting to
 promote a nationwide strike to put pressure on
 the government. This is unlikely to sway either
 Perez or his party. Most government and party
 leaders take the view that the assistance of the
 foreign petroleum companies in providing tech-
 nical and marketing help is essential for some
 time to come. Further, they probably believe
 that the issues now being debated are too
 complex  to  be  understood  by most Vene-
 zuelans, and the Democratic Action Party will
 3k 4!
 emerge historically as the one that succeeded in
 nationalizing the petroleum industry over the
 opposition of other political parties.
 The Social Christian party leadership is per-
 ceptive enough to recognize the pitfalls of total
 opposition to what is in principle a popular
 political move by Perez. This may have inspired
 several recent attempts to reach a compromise
 on Article Five. Although these efforts failed,
 the Venezuelan ability to work out a pragmatic
 solution to roost seemingly unsolvable political
 issues could result in the emergence of some
 compromise acceptable to both Perez and the
 Social  Christian  party.  Significantly, former
 president  Caldera, who has been active in
 keeping open his lines of communication with
 government and party leaders, has yet to speak
 publicly on this issue. He will do so when the
 nationalization bill goes to the Senate for debate
 soon.
 In the meantime, talks between govern-
 ment representatives and the major oil com-
 panies continue in desultory fashion, pending
 resolution of the congressional debate. Some
 industry sources have expressed surprise at the
 lack of preparation by the government team and
 its seeming inability to come up with any firm
 proposals on the organizational structure and
 management of the industry after reversion.
 This criticism is increasing both within and out-
 side the government. It undoubtedly reflects
 concern that the government, in its rush to
 nationalize the country's major extractive in-
 dustry and major export earner, may have acted
 before  it was ready to take on the job of
 operating  a  complex  multibillion-dollar  in-
 dustry. The government's negotiations will be
 watched closely by the opposition in hopes of
 eroding Perez' now strong political position.

 broad,   coordinated  plan  of action aimed at
 eliminating  US  influence south of the   Rio
 Grande. The plan, embodied in a declaration
 released three days after the conference closed
 (presumably after the attendees had a chance to
 get home safely), is intended to serve as a guide
 for all the forces of the left and not just for
 communists. Although the meeting was unques-
 tionably the high point in the Cuban Commu-
 nist  Party's  relations with  its  hemispheric
 counterparts, it will undoubtedly fall far short
 of its grandiose goal  of unifying the Latin
 American left into a solid anti-US front. There
 are likely to be very few leftists willing to adopt
 a plan of action formulated at a meeting in
 which they had no representation.
 Excerpts and summaries of the strategic
 declaration-its full text is not yet available-
 indicate that the unification of the forces of the
 left in the anti-US struggle is the document's
 basic theme; it has already become obvious,
 however, that whatever unity was achieved, even
 among those at the meeting, is likely to be only
 a  thin  veneer  of  dubious durability.  The
 Mexican Communist Party, for example, had
 hardly reached home before it disowned that
 portion  of  the declaration  that criticized
 Peking's foreign policy. In addition, parts of the
 declaration itself clearly reflect considerably less
 agreement than the unanimity it is alleged to
 have received.
 As for Havana's role, the meeting provided
 considerable evidence that the Castro regime is
 following a foreign policy more closely aligned
 than ever before with that of the USSR. In
 signing a document that condemned the Chinese
 communists by name and in serving as host for a
 meeting that could turn out to be a preparatory
 step to a world conference of communist parties
 (which Moscow hopes to use against Peking),
 the Cubans have gone further than ever before
 to support Moscow in the Sino-Soviet polemic.
 As if to ratify the blast at Peking, Fidel Castro
 personally criticized the Chinese during a press
 conference last week and praised the declara-
 tion's attack on Peking. Moreover, in signing a
 public  declaration  that  tacitly  accepts  the
 validity of the Soviets' view that violence is not
 always necessary to achieve power, the Cubans
 have  gone  on     record  as    abandoning  Che
 Guevara's rigid theoretical concepts of violent
 revolution.
 The Cubans also gave in to Moscow on the
 nature of the conference. Still wary of what it
 considers the duplicity of many Latin American
 communist leaders, Havana had preferred to
 invite a broader range of participants, including
 some revolutionary movements anathema to the
 orthodox communists. The Cubans apparently
 had in mind something akin to the conference
 of the Latin American Solidarity Organization
 held in Havana in 1967. They were also reluc-
 tant to invite some parties whose attendance
 might prove an embarrassment to the Castro
 regime. The Guyana communists, for example,
 were apparently to be excluded to prevent fric-
 tion                                                               in Cuba's blossoming  relationship with
 Guyana Prime Minister Forbes Burnham. The
 Guyanese finally attended, however, and the
 meeting was restricted to the recognized, pro-
 Moscow communist parties.
 The Cubans were not the only ones to
 compromise. The declaration gave high praise to
 Fidel Castro-which must have been difficult for
 those party chiefs who had at one time been
 subjected to his scathing denunciation-and held
 Cuba up as a showcase for the blessings of
 socialism. The fusion of Castro's guerrillas with
 the members of the pre-Castro communist party
 into what is today's Cuban Communist Party is
 described  as  "a  unity  that  constitutes  an
 example for all of Latin America's revolutionary
 movements," a clear invitation to the non-
 communist left to join forces with the commu-
 nists. The Cuban interpretation of the downfall
 of Allende in Chile in 1973 was accepted, and
 the need to be ready to use violence to defend
 revolutionary gains was underscored. The decla-
 ration, a formidable document of some 18,000
 words, is an attempt to focus attention on the
 US as the source of all the region's ills. It is
 strongly reminiscent of Castro's own Second
 Declaration of Havana on February 1962, which

 Peruvian  President Velasco appears con-
 vinced now of the need to turn virtually all
 presidential powers over to Prime Minister and
 Minister of War Morales Bermudez.
 Since Velasco's stroke on February 28,
 Morales Bermudez' influence has steadily in-
 creased and, through recent efforts to divorce
 himself from Velasco's more radical policies, he
 has further improved his position. The virtually
 uninterrupted  growth  of Morales Bermudez'
 strength within the military, combined with his
 business-like  manner and  considerable profi-
 ciency in economics, makes him the prime
 candidate to succeed Velasco.
 Radical elements in the military, however,
 became concerned, when Velasco first fell ill,
 that the pace of his extensive revolutionary
 program would be slowed as Morales Bermudez
 assumed increasing authority. Recent glimpses
 of the Prime Minister's economic policies, par-
 ticularly his apparent desire to do away with
 Velasco's economic subsidies, have led Velasco
 to fear that the radicals might attempt to inter-
 vene to ensure that the revolution remains on
 course.  The principal  radicals,  General Jose
 Graham  Hurtado,  chief  of  the  President's
 advisory council, and General Leonidas Rodri-
 guez Figueroa, commander of the second mili-
 tary                      region, which includes Lima, have also
 fallen into disfavor lately for political intriguing
 and questions of competence.
 The  moderates  who  support  Morales
 Bermudez have become increasingly alarmed at
 the leftist trend of the Velasco government.
 Although Velasco has yielded much authority to
 Morales Bermudez, the President manages to
 sustain his radical policies on a number of issues.
 The  moderates  have  been  particularly  dis-
 satisfied with Velasco's economic policies, his
 repressive measures against critics in the press,
 and his short-circuiting of the military seniority
 structure by forcing retirements and placing his
 supporters in key positions. The moderates are
 also suspicious of the extreme leftist leanings of
 some of these supporters of Velasco.

 Despite his strong position, Morales Bermu-

 to replace Velasco. He is likely, for the time 25X1
 being, to continue acquiring influence and sup-
 port gradually, while avoidin  a direct con-
 frontation  with  the  radicas.

 Northeast Asia
 TRIANGULAR TENSIONS
 Growing concern over Soviet intentions in
 Asia, in the wake of the Communist victory in
 Vietnam, was a major factor behind Peking's
 increasing  insistence  on  including  an  anti-
 hegemony                                provision  in  the   proposed  Sino-
 Japanese  Peace                         and         Friendship  treaty. The
 failure of the two sides to agree on this thorny
 issue ended the current round of treaty talks last
 week.
 Peking has for some time expressed the
 view that Moscow's influence in Hanoi is greater
 than its own and that a communist victory in
 the south represents an opportunity for the
 Soviets to increase their influence there, as well
 as in other countries in the region.
 The Chinese stepped up their propaganda
 attacks against Soviet "social imperialism" and
 "hegemonism" after the fall of Saigon; several
 commentaries have emphasized Soviet activities
 and intentions in Japan. Peking also pointed up
 the "hegemonism" issue in the joint commu-
 nique establishing diplomatic relations with the
 Philippines earlier this month. In that announce-
 ment, both countries expressed opposition to
 any  third  country  attempts  "to  establish
 hegemony or create spheres of influence in any
 part of the world," an even broader formulation
 than that proposed for the Sino-Japanese peace
 treaty
 At the outset of the Sino-Japanese talks on
 the peace treaty in January, Tokyo proposed
 omitting the anti-hegemony clause it had agreed
 to in the 1972 joint communique establishing
 relations with Peking. Desiring to maintain a
 rough balance in their relations with Moscow
 and  Peking, the Japanese at least hoped to
 soften the terms of the hegemony clause in
 order to counter any Soviet backlash to the
 conclusion of the peace pact.
 Initially, the Chinese responded in a rel-
 atively                         low key manner. Premier Chou En-lai
 told a member of the Japanese Diet in January
 that the proposed anti-hegemony language was
 not directed at Moscow and that, in any event,
 the issue should not be an obstacle to reaching
 agreement on the pact. Chou predicted that
 negotiations could be completed within three
 months.
 As late as April, the Japanese press was still
 predicting  imminent  agreement.  There were
 reports that Chinese Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-
 ping proposed a compromise that would have
 allowed the  inclusion  of the anti-hegemony
 clause in the preamble of the treaty, rather than
 in the text-a suggestion the Japanese offered
 later.
 It was not until May-and the communist
 assumption of power in Saigon-that reports
 were  leaked  suggesting  that  Peking  had
 demanded  that  the  anti-hegemony  issue be
 treated in the body of the treaty, thus giving it
 greater currency and emphasis. The Chinese
 were encouraged to maintain their harder line
 when a Japan Socialist Party delegation visiting
 Peking in May agreed to a strongly worded
 hegemony  clause  in  a joint  communique.
 Shortly  thereafter,  Tokyo    conveyed  its
 compromise proposal-including the clause in
 the preamble rather than in the text-but were
 privately rebuffed by the Chinese. For a time,
 Tokyo tried to keep the appearance of talks
 alive by claiming that Peking had not formally
 responded.  Finally,  Premier  Chou  En-lai
 reiterated  to a Japanese visitor earlier this
 month Chinese insistence that the clause be in
 the text of the treaty. In going public, Chou also
 signaled the end of serious negotiations.
 Excessive publicity surrounding the talks
 restricted each side's room for maneuver and
 may have caused some ill feelings as well. The
 Chinese might have agreed to inclusion of the
 clause in the preamble if such an arrangement
 had been negotiated strictly in private. Given

 the extent of public knowledge about the talks,
 however, the Chinese may have felt that their
 willingness to compromise on the issue of Soviet
 hegemony would have been all too evident-and
 would have given the appearance that Peking
 had buckled in the face of Soviet-inspired op-
 position.
 Fhe  Chinese  also probably calculated-
 correctly, in our view-that other aspects of
 relations with Japan would be unaffected by
 postponing the treaty. Given its political prob-
 lems with Moscow, Japan certainly cannot turn
 toward the USSR. And in time, Tokyo may
 offer Peking a more attractive proposal on the
 anti-hegemony issue; in any event, the Chinese
 will certainly continue to press Tokyo to accept
 their uncompromising stand.
 25X1
 The Soviets are in a poor position to take
 advantage of the breakdown in Japanese-Chinese
 negotiations. Soviet tactics over the last two
 weeks were fashioned with the expectation that
 a treaty would be signed. When it was not,
 Moscow was left in the unseemly position of
 appearing  to  apply  unreasoned  pressure on
 Tokyo. The Soviets will now make an effort to
 change the atmospherics, but this will not be
 very important unless Moscow is prepared to
 consider returning at least part of the northern
 territories to Japan. But Moscow has itself
 firmly locked into a position of even refusing to
 consider  returning  the  islands,  and  the
 breakdown in Sino-Japanese talks gives Moscow
 even less reason to curry favor with Japan.
 Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-Ping
 The Soviets might rethink their position if
 they had as much influence in Asia as the
 Chinese claim they have; Chinese apprehensions
 and Asian realities are not one and the same.
 Indeed, the Soviets have some concern that it
 will be China, not the Soviet Union, which will
 gain from the US defeat in South Vietnam.
 They are likely to see support for this view in
 China's developing relations with Thailand and

 Somare claims he was inspired by a dream
 to put the independence date to a vote. Passage
 was facilitated by absence from the floor of the
 most vocal opponents of cutting ties with Aus-
 tralia.
 Papua New Guinea

 INDEPENDENCE AT LAST
 Chief Minister Somare has persuaded a
 reluctant territorial House of Assembly to agree
 to September 16 as independence day for this
 Australian trust territory. Independence, orig-
 inally planned for last December, had already
 been  postponed  three times because of dif-
 ficulties over a constitution. The House of
 Assembly was insisting until last week that the
 constitution be ready before an independence
 date was set. Although differences remain and
 could still delay completion of a constitution,
 the fact that Australia has informed the UN of
 Papua New Guinea's decision would appear to
 commit the colony to holding to its timetable.
 The  toughest  unresolved  constitutional
 issue is citizenship. Racists in the House of
 Assembly are pushing for restrictive qualifica-
 tions that would force expatriate Australians to
 leave and make persons of mixed blood go
 through a period of "provisional" citizenship.
 The Somare government is resisting, on the
 grounds that such discriminatory requirements
 would blemish Papua New Guinea's reputation
 at the outset of nationhood.
 I he type of government to be set up is also
 undecided. Somare wants a centralized admin-
 istration and fears that the loose federation
 advocated by some political opponents would
 lead to early strains. Although the matter can
 probably be resolved by compromise, it may
 take considerable threshing out.
 Choosing a head of state also threatened
 for a time to become a major obstacle. The
 Somare government's proposal, that as a Com-
 monwealth member Papua New Guinea should
 have the Queen as head of state, provoked
 unexpectedly strong protests led by nationalistic
 students. The provision was passed this month
 over  vigorous  opposition and will  probably
 remain a subject of some contention.
 Substantive  disagreements  aside,  Papua
 New Guinea's experience with self-government
 has been too brief to prepare for a smooth
 transition to the parliamentary style of govern-
 ment that has been chosen. Also, the new na-
 tion's myriad problems-tribal animosities, per-
 sistent separatism,  and  a fragile government
 coalition-do not resa a an easy transition.
