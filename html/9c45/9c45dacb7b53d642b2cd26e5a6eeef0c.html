Withdrawal Rumors 
25X1 
There are a number of stories that Chinese troops 
have begun or are about to withdraw from Vietnam.  
25X1 
  public re- 25X1 
ports from Western news agencies in Beijing have cited 
unnamed Chinese sources, and yet another official, citing 
the fall of Lang Son, has claimed the fighting would end 
"soon." There are as yet no indications, however, that 
Chinese troops have ceased their advance, much less begun 
a withdrawal. 
25X1 
Vietnamese Statements  
Vietnam has officially replied to China's proposal 
to negotiate their border conflict. A vietnamese Foreign 
Ministry note yesterday termed the proposal a "trick" but 
accepted negotiations in principle. The Vietnamese 
stated they are willing to negotiate if the Chinese "per-
manently" end their aggression and withdraw "immediately 
and unconditionally" across the "historic borderline" 
previously agreed to by the two sides. 25X1 
Chinese officials have stated recently that after 
withdrawing the troops Beijing will retain the option of 
reentering Vietnam should Vietnamese activity make it 
necessary, and China is unlikely to accept a precondition 
that commits it never to cross the border again. Vietnam, 
in its reference to the "historic borderline," appears to 
be responding to rumors that Chinese troops  will withdraw 
to a border defined by China. 25X1 
Hanoi leveled its strongest changes to date against 
the US and its allies yesterday and on Thursday. The 
Vietnamese claimed that during his recent trip to the US 
and Japan, Deng Xiaoping won "approval and support" for

Beijing's actions and accused the US and its allies of 
"deliberately belittling" the seriousness of the invasion. 
One broadcast called US collusion with China part of the 
"sinister policy of the Carter administration." 
Soviet Reaction 25X1 
In his election speech yesterday, Soviet President 
Brezhnev gave no indication of what action the Soviets 
would take if China does not stop its attack on Vietnam. 
He predictably condemned China's actions and demanded 
"the immediate ending of the Chinese aggression" and a 
total Chinese withdrawal. Brezhnev warned that "the en-
tire danger of any forms of connivance" with Beijing's 
policies "is more evident now than ever before." These 
comments are consistent with the Soviet Government state-
ment of 18 February. 25X1 
Despite his reference to US collusion, Brezhnev sig-
naled a continuing Soviet desire to insulate the dialogue 
with Washington on detente and strategic arms control 25X1 
from the Sino-Vietnamese conflict. (Other aspects 
of Brezhnev's speech are discussed on Page 8.) 
Three hours after Brezhnev spoke, the Soviet Govern-
ment issued a second official statement on the Indochina 
conflict. The new statement, like the earlier one, stops 
far short of committing the Soviets to any military 
course of action and fails explicitly to place the weight 
of the USSR behind the warning that China's actions "can-
not leave uninvolved" those genuinely interested in 
peace. Indeed, the statement seems designed more to put 
pressure on unspecified states accused of "complicity" 
with the aggression and to mobilize world opinion against 
China than to warn the Chinese. The USSR-Vietnam Friend-
ship Treaty is not invoked. 
The statement focuses on China's alleged intention 
to expand its military operations into Laos. Chinese 
engineering troops have been present in Laos for years, 
but we have no indication that the Chinese are planning 
any military operations in or through Lao territory.

Differences are continuing among Iranian political 
and religious leaders over the timing for reestablishing 
normal government activity, the type of government to be 
decided by national referendum, and the treatment of 
tribal minorities. 25X1 
Minister of Information Minatchi has told a US Em-
bassy officer that the revolutionary committees will soon 
be dissolved--perhaps as early as next week. The more 
radical committee members are sure to resist any effort 
to reduce their power, however. Prime Minister Bazargan, 
who has been critical of the committees' role as a paral-
lel government, may not be able to abolish them despite 
the tacit support of Khomeini in his effort to do so. 
Even if the committee members agree to join the govern-
ment Bazargan may soon find them playing a dominant role. 
25X1 
There are also indications that the most prominent 
religious leader in Tehran, Ayatollah Taleghani, is 
beginning to separate himself from Khomeini on substan-
tive issues. He is not likely to break openly with 
Khomeini, who remains near the peak of national power. 
25X1 
Taleghani publicly stated that he and Khomeini did not 
discuss important issues during  their meeting prior to 
Khomeini's departure for Qom. 25X1

NORTH YEMEN - SOUTH YEMEN 
25X1 
A cease-fire went into effect this morning along the 
border between North and South Yemen, according to press 
sources. Details of withdrawals from the border area 
25X1 will be worked out at the Arab  League meeting now sched-
uled for tomorrow in Kuwait. 25X1

Yesterday morning there was sporadic fighting re-  25X1 
ported about 30 kilometers northwest of Al Bayda 
25X1 
There was no satellite photography of the area wherP 
the fighting reportedly took place, but photography of 25X1 
Al Bayda yesterday showed tanks guarding the northern ap-
proach into the town and multiple rocket launchers de-
ployed inside North Yemen at a dirt airstrip southwest of 
Al Bayda. The South Yemeni infantry brigade is still oc-
cupying the high ground nearby. Across the border in 
South Yemen, photography shows a decrease in tanks, field 
artillery, and multiple rocket launchers. A small convoy 
towing field artillery was headed toward Al Bayda. 
There are no reports of fighting near Qatabah yes-25X1 
terday, but South Yemeni forces appear to be in control 
of the area. The artillery pieces aimed toward Ibb on 
Tuesday are gone, but tanks are deployed further west 
guarding the approach to Qatabah. Vehicles appear to be 
moving freely to the west--an indication that South 
Yemeni - supported forces may be farther west toward Ibb 
as the North Yemenis claim.

BRIEF AND COMMENTS 
USSR: Brezhnev on Disarmament 
The highlights of Soviet President Brezhnev's 
speech yesterday dealt with arms control. 
25X1 
Brezhnev called for SALT III to begin after the 
entry into force of SALT II, a reflection of increasing 
Soviet apprehension about prospects for US ratification. 
In contrast, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko last May 
called for SALT III to begin "immediately after the 
signing" of SALT II. Brezhnev asserted that SALT III 
would slow the creation of new weapons types and pro-
vide for further reductions "by both sides." 
25X1 
The Soviet leader also spoke at length about the 
benefits of the prospective SALT II treaty and predicted 
that it will "probably be signed during my meeting with 
President Carter, hopefully in the near future." He 
called the treaty a "reasonable compromise," but noted 
that "not everything in it fully accords with our wishes." 
He claimed that it would help revive the Comprehensive 
Test Ban, Conventional Arms Transfers, and Mutual and 
Balanced Force Reduction talks and improve the interna-
tional climate. 
25X1 
Brezhnev made the first reference by a top-level 
Soviet official to reports about the possible deployment 
in West Germany of "medium-range nuclear-missile weapons 
aimed at the Soviet Union." He said such a development 
would raise tension in Europe, exacerbate the arms race, 
and drastically increase the danger to West Germany. He 
offered to negotiate the reduction of nuclear missiles 
and medium-range and other weapons in Europe "on the 
basis of complete reciprocity," but said due account must 
be taken of US bases there as well. 
25X1 
If Brezhnev was including Soviet medium-range mis-
siles, it would be the first time that Moscow has indi-
cated willingness to put them on the bargaining block in 
arms control talks. Brezhnev seems to be encouraging the 
West, especially the West Germans, to pursue the arms 
control rather than force modernization track in con-
sidering NATO policy options. 25X1

Brezhnev called for "something like a non-aggres-
sion pact"--an agreement on "not being the first to use 
either nuclear or conventional arms"--among the signa-
tories of the Helsinki Final Act. The inclusion of con-
ventional arms is probably intended both as a response to 
the French proposal for a European disarmament conference 
focusing on conventional weapons and as an attempt to 
capitalize on what Moscow perceives as frustration in 
some West European capitals with the current pace of 
European disarmament talks. 25X1 
He also referred to the possibility of extending 
the so-called military confidence-building measures in 
the Helsinki Final Act to cover "all considerable troop 
movements" and "major naval exercises." Brezhnev's 
reference to naval maneuvers in this context is the 
first authoritative Soviet statement on this subject, 
although Soviet diplomats have privately expressed an 
interest in pursuing this topic. 25X1 
In discussing the Soviet defense effort, Brezhnev 
said the USSR was allocating considerable means to 
strengthen its security "both in the West and in the 
East." He claimed that the USSR is spending as much as 
is absolutely necessary. This statement was consistent 
with several previous ones he has made and was in keeping 
with what his Politburo colleagues have been saying. 
Brezhnev's tack on military spending, like his 25X1 
defensive remarks on the compromises by both sides at the 
SALT negotiations, may have been in response to domestic 
opposition to any concessions on Soviet defense. Except 
for these issues, he betrayed few differences within 
the Soviet leadership, judging by available summaries 
of similar speeches by his colleagues during the past 
month. The US Embassy in Moscow has pointed out that 
Brezhnev and Gromyko are the only Politburo members who 
addressed the US-Soviet relationship, suggesting indeci-
sion in that body and reflecting apprehension over 
Sino-US normalization and Indochina.

POLAND: Pope's Visit to Poland 
The scheduling of the visit by Pope John Paul II to 
Poland from 2 to 10 June--instead of 10 to 14 May as de-
sired by the Polish Church and the Vatican--is a Pyrrhic 
victory for Polish party conservatives. Poles will be 
keenly aware that the regime's intransigence prevented 25X1 
the Pope from attending the important religious and na-
tional observances in May. 25X1 
The Pope probably agreed to the schedule once he 
became aware of the strength of the regime's insistence. 
Had the church prolonged the negotiations until May, end-
ing any chance of a visit this spring, the prospects for 
serious disturbances would have increased during the ob-
servance of the 900th anniversary of the martyrdom  of 
St. Stanislaw, Poland's patron saint.   25X1 
The Polish Church will probably adopt a "more-in-

SPAIN: Suarez' Victory 
25X1 
Prime Minister Suarez emerged stronger following 
Thursday's election, while his principal rivals, Felipe 
Gonzales' Socialists, were weakened. The Communists in-
creased their seats in the lower house of parliament from 
20 to 23, and the rightists lost heavily. Although 
Suarez' Union of the Democratic Center fell nine seats 
short of an absolute majority in the all-important lower 
house, he should be able to form a one-party government. 
25X1 
The results are a personal triumph for Suarez and 
for his electoral strategy aimed at the center and center-
left. He now has time in the post-electoral period to 
unify and strengthen his party. Important tests lie 
ahead, but Suarez should be able to get by with ad hoc 
majorities--at least until a resolution of the regional 
autonomy problem frees him to form a coalition with one 
or more regional parties. 25X1 
The Socialists' failure to improve on their showing 
in the previous election will strengthen radicals within 
the party who oppose Gonzalez' moderate line. The party 
may veer to the left--as it did in the closing stages of 
the election campaign--to consolidate its base prior to 
the party congress in May. This switch is likely to be 
reflected in more aggressive  tactics by the Socialist 25X1 
labor union. 
The Communist Party, by contrast, will be buoyed by 
its gain and the Socialists' poor showing and will be 
looking for further gains in next month's municipal elec-
tions. 
25X1 
The emergence of several new regional parties in 
parliament signals difficulties ahead on autonomy nego-
tiations. In the Basque region particularly, the win-
ning of four seats by two extremist parties linked with 
ETA terrorists will stiffen the demands of Basque Na-
tionalists.

ITALY: La Malta's Failure 
25X1 
President Pertini will meet with party leaders next 
week, in the wake of Prime Minister - designate La Malfa's 
failure to form a government, before deciding whether to 
appoint a replacement for La Malfa  or dissolve  parlia-
ment and call an early election. 25X1 
La Malfa was unable to break the deadlock resulting 
from the Communists' insistence on cabinet seats and the 
Christian Democrats' refusal to support any government 
that met these demands. His proposal included posts for 
Christian Democrats, Social Democrats, and his Repub-
lican Party. It would have relied for its parliamentary 
majority on abstention by the Communists and Socialists. 
25X1 
The Communists evidently rejected this alternative, 
and the Socialists were reluctant to commit themselves 
to a government unacceptable to the Communists. Communist 
chief Berlinguer did suggest that his party might consider 
backing a government composed of technicians--including 
independents elected to the current parliament on the 
leftist ticket--but this proposal ran into stiff 
25X1 
Christian Democratic opposition. 
Although the Christian Democrats and Communists 
seem unwilling to alter their respective positions, 
Pertini may decide to appoint another prime minister - 
designate--probably a Christian Democrat such as party 
president Piccoli or Foreign Minister Forlani--in what 
would likely be a final attempt to avoid a new election.

SOUTHERN AFRICA: Frontline Summit 
25X1 
Angolan President Neto has invited the presidents 
of the frontline states to Luanda this weekend to dis-
cuss the Namibian situation. The Mozambican and Botswanan 
presidents have accepted, but we do not know if the Zam-
bian and Tanzanian presidents will attend. The presi-
dents probably will consider the UN Secretary General's 
recent report on Namibia--particularly his proposal that 
UN liaison offices be situated in Angola, Zambia, and 
Botswana to facilitate monitoring Namibian guerrillas 
in these countries after a cease-fire. Neto also wants 
to discuss the situation in Rhodesia and has invited Rho-
desian nationalist leaders Joshua Nkomo and Robert Mug-

INDIA-PAKISTAN: Nuclear Program 
25X1 
The Indian Foreign Minister has for the first time 
stated publicly that Pakistan is pursuing a nuclear de-
velopment program that "may not be entirely for peaceful 
purposes." There is mounting concern in the Indian Gov-
ernment that Pakistan is pursuing a nuclear capability. 
An official Indian disclosure of Pakistan's possible 
movement toward such a capability will severely limit 
New Delhi's maneuverability in negotiations with the US 
over safeguards and other bilateral nuclear problems. 
Any policy that might appear to foreclose Indian options 
for response to this perceived new threat could even 
threaten the cohesion of the ruling Janata coalition.

from endemic tribal, religious, and ethnic animosities. 
All of this could be too much for the Tanzanians to handle. 
We do not have detailed information on Tanzanian plans 
for a successor government in Kampala. 25X1 
At this point we see little chance that other neigh-
boring countries would attempt to intervene. They 
would, however, be nervous about a total breakdown of 
order in Uganda but would probably be most concerned that 
any turmoil not spill over into their territory and ag-
gravate their own domestic problems. The Libyans, despite 
their ties to fellow Muslim Amin, would probably not be 
inclined to stay around and attempt to repair the situa-
tion; they only reluctantly came to Amin's aid last 
month. 25X1 
The Soviets would probably quickly try to cultivate 
whatever regime emerges after Amin's fall. They would, 
however, remain sensitive to the concerns of Nyerere, 
who like Amin has received the bulk of his military sup-
plies from the USSR. We know of no close Soviet ties to 
the various Ugandan exile groups, but the Soviets have 
long believed that their role as chief supplier for the 
Ugandan military has given them connections that would 
survive Amin's departure.

IRAN: Foreign Suppliers Face Cutbacks 
25X1 
25X1 
The political crisis in Iran already has curtailed 
imports and triggered cancellations of some major con-
tracts for future delivery. Even if the new government 
succeeds in restoring order, imports are unlikely to re-
turn to anything like the $18-billion annual rate of a 
few months ago. Foreign exchange constraints as well as 
new economic priorities point to a much smaller Iranian 
market for foreign goods. 
25X1 
The developed countries have provided 85 percent 
of Iran's total imports--most of which were manufactured 
goods, with capital-intensive products predominating. 
In 1977 and 1978, the US supplied 24 percent of Iranian 
imports from the major developed countries; West Germany, 
22 percent; Japan, 18 percent;  and the UK, Italy, and 
France together, 23 percent. 
25X1 
Iran as an Export Market  
Exports from the US to Iran grew from $2.7 billion 
in 1977 to an annual rate of $3.7 billion in the first 
nine months of 1978, accounting for 2.7 percent of total 
US exports. The US aircraft industry sold nearly 8 per-
cent of its commercial exports to Iran, the largest 
share for any US industry. Should Iran cancel orders 
for commercial aircraft, the impact would be softened 
by the industry's strong order backlog and a willingness 
of other customers to move up their delivery dates. 
US firms signed a minimum of $4.5 billion in new 25X1 
contracts during 1977 and 1978. The largest contracts 
were for military goods and services, communications 
networks, and construction projects. In addition, joint 
French-US ventures won contracts valued at about $2.7 
billion for highway construction.   25X1 
Military suppliers have been hardest hit by contract 
cancellations. The ousted government of Prime Minister 
Bakhtiar canceled roughly $7 billion in outstanding con-

tracts with the US for weapons purchases to save foreign 
exchange and to curb the large military buildup. Iran 
will initially pay termination and default charges on 
contracts it cancels from a trust fund it has established 
with the US Government. If weapons originally ordered 
by Iran can be sold to other buyers, Iran could receive 
some repayment. 25X1 
West German exports to Iran of $2.7 billion in 1977 
and $2.5 billion in the first three quarters of 1978 rep-
resent about 2 percent of its total exports. More than 
300 West German companies with a total of 10,000 West 
German employees operated facilities in Iran. Loss of 
the Iranian market would be particularly troublesome for 
the depressed steel and nuclear reactor industries. Few 
companies, however, would lose money on existing contracts 
because of export and investment insurance financed by 
the West German Government. 25X1 
Japan, which sold goods to Iran worth $1.9 billion 
in 1977 and $2.2 billion in the first nine months of 1978, 
stopped issuing export credits to Iran last month, and 
no goods destined for Iran have been shipped since then. 
In 1977 Japanese sales to Iran accounted for 7 percent 
of its metal manufactures exports. 
25X1 
In 1977 and 1978 Japan received $1.1 billion in re-
ported contracts from Iran; it is anxious to reestablish 
economic links with the new government to avoid contract 
cancellations. The Japanese, however, will probably 
more than make up losses from the Iranian modernization 
cutback by switching  to China as a major market for iron 
and steel exports. 25X1 
The UK's exports to Iran exceeded $1 billion in 1977 
and again in 1978, accounting for about 2 percent of total 
British exports. Iran was Britain's largest arms client, 
and half of the $700 million in new contracts in 1977 
and 1978 were for military goods. Plans for most of a 
$1.5-billion British-built complex at Esfahan to manu-
facture guns, ammunition, and spare parts for tanks were 
suspended by the Bakhtiar government. British arms ex-
port contracts totaling nearly $2 billion also are in

jeopardy. In 1977, sales to Iran accounted for 6 percent 
of British motor vehicle exports. Chrysler UK has laid 
off 1,500 workers because exports to Iran have been dis-
rupted. 
25X1 
Italy's sales to Iran have been running at about $1 
billion, or 2 percent of total exports, over the last 
two years. Italian construction and engineering firms 
have orders totaling $6 billion. The Italian firms are 
accustomed to political unrest, strikes, and bureaucratic 
delays, and are not panicking. Although payments delays 
are causing cash flow problems work on most projects is 
continuing. The Italians are hoping that the new govern-
ment will not abandon public works projects already under

way. 
France's economic stake in Iran has been comparatively 
small, but recently it has led the developed countries in 
signing contracts with Iran. In addition to the joint 
French-US ventures, French firms won $6.5 billion in new 
contracts, most signed in 1977. Roughly half were for 
electric power facilities, primarily nuclear. 
The nuclear power plant contracts with Framatome, 25X1 
valued roughly at over $2.5 billion, were recently can-
celed by the Bakhtiar government. Although most direct 
financial losses will be covered by the French Foreign 
Trade Insurance Company, Framatome already is in financial 
trouble because of the slowdown in France's own nuclear 
program and a decline in orders from other countries. 
Even though Framatome recently signed a letter of intent 
to build two similar plants in China, cancellation of the 
Iranian project  will seriously set back company plans.
