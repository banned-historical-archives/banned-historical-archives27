 Acting National Intelligence Officer for Economics
 SUBJECT:         China Luncheon and Discussions, 23 October 1985
 1.  Attached for your information are some background papers for your
 23 October luncheon meeting on China.  The guests were told that we would
 like to hear their thoughts on doing business in China and their observa-
 tions on progress in the reform movement.  Information on the activities
 of their firms in China is contained in Tab C.
 2.  After the luncheon the guests will be briefed by            n his
 experiences during the Vice President's recent trip and hear from   I
 analysts on their views of the reform movement.  Following these discus-
 sions, the guests will meet again briefly with you before departing.
 3.  As you can see from the attached materials, the reform movement
 is going very well from China's perspective.  Industrial output and
 capital spending are growing very rapidly despite efforts by Beijing to
 cool the pace of expansion.  Rapid growth of imports, which has resulted
 in a sharp drop in foreign exchange reserves, and infrastructure
 bottlenecks seem to be the key problems.
 4.  On the nuclear front, the Chinese announced last month that they
 intend to place some of their nuclear installations under IAEA safe-
 guards.                    The Chinese want to have 10,000 MW of nuclear capacity on line
 by the year 2000 and hope to import three plants for completion in the
 early 1990s.

 China:            Recent Economic Reforms
 19 April 1985
 Summary
 China's ambitious economic reform program has
 gained momentum since April of last year, with
 reformers--backed by Deng Xiaoping--pushing through
 major policy directives regarding agriculture and
 industry.  The new policies are not capitalist, but
 they do represent a pronounced break with traditional
 Marxist economic practices and, thus, are
 controversial.  Beijing's recent crackdown on economic
 crimes such as price gouging, speculation,
 blackmarketeering, and cadre abuse of power, is
 designed to smooth the way for wage and price reforms
 that will be implemented later this year.
 Industry
 The Third Plenum of the 12th Party Congress in October 1984 placed the
 party's official stamp of approval on many industrial reform measures that
 Beijing has experimented with since 1979.  The most important industrial
 reforms approved at the plenum are:
 -- Reform of the Planning System.  China is gradually moving away from
 the rigid central planning system modelled on the Soviet Union.
 Under the reforms, production of items of national importance--such
 as steel, petroleum products and chemicals--remain under mandatory
 state quotas.  Most products, however, are to be produced under
 "guidance plans" that are set by the state but that are flexible

 enough to enable enterprises to adjust to changing market
 conditions.  Some consumer items and over-quota production of most
 goods are to be regulated by China's equivalent of an open market.
 -- Enterprise Autonomy.  A major goal of the reforms is to increase the
 authority of enterprise managers and reduce the power of party and
 government officials in economic decisionmaking.  Managers already
 have more leeway to develop production and marketing strategies,
 hire and fire workers, and set prices and wages; the control of
 central ministries and provincial governments is to be reduced
 correspondingly.  Competition between enterprises is encouraged.
 -- Price Reform.  In perhaps the most important measure, Beijing has
 begun to adjust domestic prices and reform the pricing mechanism.
 Prices of key products such as coal and steel will still be set by
 the state but at levels that better reflect relative scarcities in
 the economy.  The prices of many other products, including most
 manufactures, will fluctuate in response to market conditions within
 bounds set by the state.  Supply and demand alone now determine the
 prices of minor consumer goods such as some clothing products,
 cosmetics, and vegetables.
 -- Wage Reform.  Wages, once guaranteed regardless of output or
 qualifications, will now reflect job performance.  Workers with
 greater productivity will receive higher wages.  Wages will also
 reflect seniority, the cost of living, and skills in great demand.
 -- Tax System.  Instead of turning all profits over to the government,
 enterprises pay a share of their profits in taxes.  Enterprise
 managers can use after-tax profits for worker bonuses or investment.
 -- Bank Reform.  The banking system is being reorganized.  Bank loans
 are increasingly replacing government grants as the source of
 capital for enterprises.  Banks now have increased authority to
 approve or deny loans, and some banks ma  ad ust loan rates within a
 20-percent range of the state-set rates.
 -- International Trade.  International trade and foreign investment in
 China is being strongly encouraged.  City and provincial governments
 have more authority to deal with foreign firms.  Foreign trade
 enterprises can now operate as commissioned agents for manufacturers
 and importers of most products.  Some of China's key state

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/01 : CIA-RDP87B00342RO01102420003-5
 enterprises are allowed to engage directly in discussions with
 foreign businessmen and have independent authority to sign contracts
 for technological transformation projects, joint ventures, and
 compensation trade operations.  Foreign firms engaged in joint
 venture production can sell their output within China as long as the
 venture's foreign exchange expenditures and receipts are balanced.
 The industrial reforms approved in 1984 are designed to correct
 continuing problems in the urban economic sector:
 -- Inefficiency, waste, and quality problems that persist despite
 double-digit growth in both 1983 and 1984.
 -- Commercial and transportation systems that are incapable of handling
 agricultural surpluses and record production of coal and other raw
 materials.
 -- Party and State bureaucracies that continue to meddle extensively in
 day-to-day business activity, stifling enterprise initiative and
 productivity.
 -- Increased subsidies to urban households that have c    4k 4, .4 to six
 consecutive budget deficits totalling $28 billion.
 Agriculture
 In its first major policy statement of 1985, Beijing signalled its
 intention to place greater reliance on market forces to guide agricultural
 production.  Instead of purchasing all grain produced--and paying a premium
 price for over-quota production--the state will sign production contracts
 with individual farmers for a specified quantity of grain.  Both the
 contracted amount of grain and the purchase price will be less than
 previous averages.  Peasants will be encouraged to sell surplus production
 on the open market, but the state will purchase excess grain if the free
 market price falls below a state-determined minimum price.  Peasants
 growing grain on land ill-suited to grain production will be offered
 subsidies to raise livestock or grow. cash crops.  In addition, price
 controls on pork and vegetables are being lifted.
 The new policies are designed to promote the development of a
 diversified agricultural sector and to encourage peasants to produce better
 quality products and make more efficient use of their land.  Beijing also
 wants to reduce the growing surplus of grain caused by earlier agricultural
 reforms and to relieve the financial burden imposed by the previous
 commitment to purchase all over-quota production at premium prices.

 Is this Capitalism?
 Although a distinct departure from orthodox central planning, the
 recent reforms will not transform China into a capitalist economy.  The
 state will continue to own the means of production, will still have-direct
 control over output, pricing, and distribution of key products, and will
 continue to make major investment decisions.  The state will also retain
 the right to appoint or remove enterprise managers and shut down
 inefficient enterprises.
 Problems Accompanying Reform
 Although reforms have contributed to rapid economic growth, large
 Increases in personal income and in the money supply and strong industrial
 demand for raw materials have caused a surge in prices during the past six
 months.  Recently, the Chinese media has suggested a high-level concern
 with several major problems including inflation, a 1984 budget deficit that
 was almost twice as large as expected, and a sharp increase in economic
 crimes such as price gouging, smuggling, and fraud.  Beijing anticipated
 dislocations in the early stages of urban economic reform, but probably has
 been surprised at the extent to which local officials and enterprise
 managers men advantage of loose reform guidelines to make windfall
 profits.
 The emergence of these problems appears to have intensified debate
 within the leadership about the direction and pace of economic reforms, and
 conservative leaders have become more vocal in expressing practical and
 ideological concerns about the new policies.  Reform leaders have responded
 by tightening supervision of bank credit and worker bonuses and by
 promising to punish those guilty of economic crimes.  The reformers seem
 determined to press ahead, but we expect them to proceed cautiously,
 particularly when implementing price reform.

 China's Nuclear Power Development: Do US Firms Still Have a Chance?
 Summary
 The Sino-US nuclear agreement signed last week allows US firms a
 belated entry into the long-running competition to sell nuclear power
 plant technology and equipment to China. Although Beijing supposedly
 wants to conclude contracts this year, the US is by no means out of the
 running. The fact that an extremely attractive deal from West Germany
 has not yet been signed probably indicates that the Chinese waited for a
 chance to negotiate with US firms. Beijing may only use US proposals to
 increase leverage on other bidders, but there are strong indications that
 some fairly influential Chinese are still disposed to seek US technology for
 the commercial nuclear program.  Even if this preference exists, the
 nuclear agreement does not guarantee US firms any sales; the Chinese
 can be expected to continue to hammer away at all vendors' offers to
 secure the best possible deal.
 Vice-Premier Li Peng, who visited the US for the first time, is a
 major influence on the direction of China's nuclear program. Li is
 apparently agreeable to hearing US proposals, but may not be convinced
 that the US presents a financially attractive source of technology. His visit

 provided US industry with a key opportunity to promote its strengths in
 transferring nuclear power plant technology.
 This has been a year of increasing activity for the Chinese commercial nuclear
 program. The Seventh Five-Year Plan is being formulated, and efforts to develop
 nuclear power will have to show results for projects to receive state funding. The
 Chinese want to have 10,000 MW of nuclear capacity on-line by the year 2000, supplying
 about 5 percent of China's electric power; they hope to have three imported plants (at
 Guangdong, Sunan, and Liaoning) and a "domestic" effort (Qinshan, or the 728 plant)
 complete in the early 1990s (see Figure 1).
 Political Progress...
 In their efforts to obtain nuclear plants and equipment, the Chinese have signed a
 number of nuclear cooperation agreements, particularly in the last four months (Figure
 2). These agreements have served other purposes as well. The Chinese have increased
 their access to suppliers of ancillary equipment; they have widened their research and
 development contacts worldwide; and in successive negotiations they have shown
 increasing willingness to place internationally-accepted restrictions on their nuclear
 dealings. Taken together with their growing involvement in the International Atomic
 Energy Agency, the Chinese hoped these agreements would assuage the proliferation
 concerns of the US and Japan, who had been the two major holdouts in nuclear
 cooperation agreements with Beijing
 Commercial Delays
 Commercial negotiations for individual projects continue to lag in spite of the
 progress on the political front. Deadlines for Guangdong and Sunan have come and
 gone, and no final contracts have been signed.
 The Chinese have hammered away at French prices on Guangdong for years, but
 still are not satisfied. The French said recently that the Chinese wanted prices for
 Guangdong reduced another 20 percent, a ludicrous amount at this stage of the game.
 Separate talks on plant financing and equipment  ri  s both apparently ended in
 deadlock a few days after the Sino-US signing.
 Although the West Germans are proposing an extremely attractive deal for
 China's Sunan plant northwest of Shanghai that includes tech transfer, compensatory
 trade financing and Chinese provision of waste disposal as partial payment, the Chinese
 so far have merely signed a non-compulsory memorandum of understanding to buy
 West German reactors, similar to the agreements signed with France in 1978 and 1983.

 Japan has already sold a reactor pressure vessel to China for a small,
 domestically-built plant (Oinshan), but. even with an agreement signed in July and strong
 industry lobbying efforts in Beijing, it did not expect to bid on China's intended complete
 plant imports.
 Interest in US Participation
 Several incidents this year suggest that at least part of the Chinese bureaucracy
 is still anxious to include the United States as a possible participant in the commercial
 nuclear power program. In January, Vice-Premier Li Peng repeated Zhao Ziyang's?
 non-proliferation statements to the press before the Guangdong joint venture signing.
 The Chinese were noticeably upset when these statements received scant attention in
 the American press; Li's statements were intended as an obvious signal to the US
 regarding the stalled nuclear agreement.
 Jiang Shengjie, former Vice-Minister of the Minister of Nuclear Industry (MNI)
 who is now head of both China's Nuclear Safety Bureau and the China Nuclear Society,
 as well as chairman of MNI's Science and Technology Commission, has repeatedly
 sought to include US firms in nuclear seminars in China. He also has pressed US
 industry over the last year to develop its ties with China's Nuclear Power Plant
 Negotiating Team (NPPNT). The NPPNT has been given the responsibility of negotiating
 with foreign vendors and making recommendations on suppliers to the State Council; its
 h   d !-in Zhongtang, has refused to meet with US vendors in the absence of a bilateral.
 Competitive Advantages of US Firms
 The US enjoys several competitive advantages as a nuclear supplier to China.
 Westinghouse's track record in transferring nuclear power technology to other countries
 is unmatched. Kraftwerk Union's (KWU's) success in transferring technology to Brazil
 and Argentina is noteworthy, but the technology KWU is offering China may be less
 China's desire to become a nuclear plant exporter for the Pacific Basin make
 Westinghouse technology and training even more attractive. Beijing is unsure of its
 ability to earn foreign exchange into the next century from its oil and textiles, and hopes
 to develop its export capabilties over a wide range of capital construction activities,
 including nuclear, as a source of foreign exchange earnings. Recipients of KWU
 technology in Argentina and Brazil are not actively selling nuclear plants and
 components in the international market, as are current and former Westinghouse
 licensees in France and Japan.
 Several other factors favor US participation in the nuclear program in China. The
 US is already heavily involved in China's nuclear safety efforts as a result of the nuclear
 safety protocol, which led to the creation of a Nuclear Safety Bureau modeled after the
 US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. US nuclear engineering firms have proved their

 expertise to China and several have already been contacted to evaluate bid proposals
 from other parties. Other US firms are submitting bids on non-nuclear components of
 Chinese nuclear plants
 Disadvantages facing US firms
 The main disadvantage faced by US firms will be their late entrance into
 full-fledged commercial negotiations. The Chinese have been bargaining with the
 French since 1983 and with West Germany since the middle of last year. The burden
 will be on US firms to show that a US bid to supply plants for Sunan or Guangdong can
 match proposed French or German deliveries.
 Another disadvantage is the cost of US technology. The West Germans are
 supposedly offering technology transfer at lower cost than the US would, and are willing
 to negotiate compensatory trade as well.
 Prospects for US Sales
 Prospects for US sales to China depend on whether Beijing is seriously interested
 in negotiating with the US at this late date; whether price alone will determine the
 choice of vendor; and whether the Chinese decide to focus on a single technology.F_
 China appears seriously interested in negotiating with US nuclear firms, and talks
 with other vendors are apparently deadlocked. However, Beijing's desire to conclude the
 nuclear agreement stemmed from political as well as economic motives. It is possible
 that China has already ruled out US sales, but is stalling in negotiations with France and
 Germany so as not to deflate the US initiative in carrying the bilateral through to
 completion.
 Even if US firms do have time to negotiate for business in China's nuclear power
 program and are the preferred source of supply, they may not realize the $US6-10
 billion in sales to the PRC that they originally expected. Beijing appears willing to
 bargain almost indefinitely for low prices and cheap financing. China may fill its nuclear
 equipment needs through the 1980s by relying on a pool of suppliers, keeping bidding
 competitive on future nuclear plant and component purchases. In this bidding
 environment, US firms would do well to sell a single complete plant or a handful of
 components.
 If the Chinese decide to make a concerted effort to assimilate nuclear technology
 to build plants for both domestic use and for export, the choices boil down to low-cost
 German technology that maybe transferred less effectively versus higher-cost US
 technology with a proven record of successful tech transfer. In this bidding
 environment, Chinese assessments of the strengths of the two countries' offerings may
 carry more weight than considerations of price.

 The role of Li Peng
 In this context, Li Pang's role in the nuclear program makes his visit to the United
 States critical to US sales prospects. Li was personally responsible for negotiating the
 memoranda of understanding with France and Great Britain in 1983 for the Guangdong
 Nuclear Power Plant. Shortly thereafter he was promoted from Vice-Minister of Water
 Resources and Electric Power (MWREP) to Vice-Premier of China. As Vice-Premier he
 has been consolidating his control over the energy portfolio, including coal and electric
 power
 The head of the NPPNT, Lin Zhongtang, has avoided dealing with US firms in the
 absence of a bilateral agreement; he reportedly is convinced that the West German
 Kraftwerk Union (KWU) reactor is the best deal China can hope for. Li Peng's
 impressions of the US nuclear industry resulting from his visit may lead to NPPNT
 contacts with US industry and could prove a deciding factor in China's choice of
 nuclear power equipment and technology.
