FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
I. MAJOR PROBLEMS 
MIDDLE EAST 
King Husayn is letting the terrorists operate more and 
more openly throughout Jordan. During the recent Muslim 
holidays, fedayeen groups collected funds in Amman, canvas-
sing hotels and the homes of foreigners. They have also 
been harassing tourists, and Ambassador Symmes is worried 
about possible incidents involving US nationals. -jorda-
nian secui'ityforces are now cooperating with the fedayeen's 
own security patrols. 
Husayn's new modus vivendi with the fedayeen is no 
doubt based on a recognition of the terrorist movement's 
growing popularity in Jordan. The King also seems to think 
he can better control the fedayeen by working with them. 
50X1 
It now appears that Moshe Dayan will defer his bid for 
the premiership--perhaps until the Labor Party convenes in 
June to decide the ranking of party leaders on the voting 
lists for the fall elections. Even though Dayan and his 
group abstained yesterday in the Labor Party vote approving 
Mrs. Meir's nomination as interim prime minister, he said 
he would stay on as defense minister. This would seem to 
rule out any attempt by Dayan to challenge Mrs. Meir's con-
firmation in the Knesset.

EUROPE 
There is nothing significant to report. 
SOVIET AFFAIRS 
The East German and West Berlin negotiators met again 
this afternoon on East German initiative in a last-ditch 
effort to reach some meeting of the minds before the West 
German presidential election tomorrow. 
seems 
that the East Germans offered passes for Easter and discus- 50X1 
sions on passes for other holidays if the West Germans trans-
fer the election out of Berlin. This Chancellor Kiesinger 
is reported unwilling to do so late in the game; hence the 
meeting evidently will take place as scheduled in West Berlin 
and there will be no holiday' passes for West Berliners. 
The checkpoints at both ends of the Berlin-Helmstedt 
autobahn were closed to all traffic for about two hours in 
the afternoon. The delays were attributed to Soviet troop 
movements; small British and French convoys were held up, 
but no US convoys were involved. All other roads to and 
from Berlin were normal. 
There was some Soviet air activity in the vicinity of 
the corridors. Allied air traffic continued normally, how-
ever, and the Soviet controller in the air safety center 
is maintaining a business-as-usual attitude.

VIETNAM 
The Communists may have kicked off the second phase 
of their current offensive, at least in the highlands of 
II Corps. Two major enemy ground attacks occurred there 
in the last 24 hours. For only the second time in the 
war, the Communists used tanks in an unsuccessful attack 
on a special forces camp in Kontum Province. In the second 
attack, a US infantry company taking part in a sweep 30 
miles to the southwest suffered heavy losses. Elsewhere 
in the country, action was generally low again yesterday.

PANAMA 
The situation within the Guard 
looks 
shaky following the removal of Colonel Martinez. Major 
personnel shifts and organizational changes could have had 
a weakening effect. Although Torrijos seems to have con-
solidated his position, the loyalty and unity of the Guard 
have not been tested since Martinez' ouster.

The Ethiopian government's firm response to the an-

that the situation will stay under control over the short 
run. The underlying discontent, however, is deeper and 
more widespread than in the past and now has even pene-
trated into the military. The Emperdr and his cabinet are 
said to be aware of the trouble. They are doing almost 
nothing, however, in the way of reforms to correct the 
basic problems, which are not unlike student problems else-
where.

.? - FOR 1 HE PRE,S1DENT ONLY 
THE LEADERSHIP OF COMMUNIST CHINA 
The leadership of Communist China has gone through a 
violent convulsion during the Cultural Revolution, one from 
which it will be a long time recovering. There was a massive 
purge of veteran party leaders in 1966. Since then, the sur-
vivors at the top of China's power structure--an inner circle 
of six still dominated by the venerable Mao Tse-tung--have 
presented a virtually unchanging public face. This appear-
ance of stability has persisted despite violent social up-
heaval, bloody factional fighting, several reversals of na-
tional policy, and the political destruction of half a dozen 
men in the second echelon of the leadership. 
The official voices of the regime have consciously por-
trayed the top six as a unified team. ?This is misleading. 
Today's power center is not the loyal phalanx of Mao's lieu-
tenants that was projected to the outside world in the re-
gime's first 16 years. These men are, rather, a disparate 
group, not natural or congenial allies. 
The political elite today bears little resemblance to 
the monolithic Politburo of the 1950s. In addition to Mao, 
the inner circle includes four veteran leaders and Mao's 
wife. Since the spring of 1967, this inner circle has been 
supplemented by a frequently changing secondary elite. This 
group now numbers eight, all of whom are new to the apex of 
political power. 
The central figure and still the authority for basic 
policy is Mao Tse-tung. His role in the decision-making

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
process is almost certainly decisive, but he probably does 
not intervene personally except on issues of major impor-
tance. 
Although arbitrary and 
suspicious he has been forced., in the fluid political sit-
uation of the past several years, to arbitrate among com-
peting interest groups and, on occasion, to compromise. He 
clearly feels that his time is running out, but despite dis-
appointments and reversals, he has not abandoned his romantic 
vision of a communized, egalitarian China nor his sense that 
the Chinese revolution is his own creation. 
In the early 1960s, Mao apparently detected a growing 
resistance to his policies from the entrenched party, bureauc-
racy,' and from this convinced himself that leaders ?in line 
to succeed him would sell out his revolution and turn to So-
viet-style revisionism. This fear--partly paranoia, partly 
justified--is the overriding factor among many which have 
produced the "Cultural Revolution" which he unleashed in 1966. 
In striking at his erstwhile subordinates and the bureaucracy 
they controlled, Mao virtually demolished the old party ma-
chine painstakingly built up over a period of three decades. 
No cohesive organization has yet risen to replace it. On the 
contrary, the destructive energies of the Cultural Revolution 
have torn the body politic into competing interest groups, 
each striving for power--or survival--at the expense of the 
others.

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
During the past three years a group of leaders asso-
ciated with Mao's more radical policies rose rapidly on the 
crest of the political turmoil. These men have tended to 
encourage Mao to push his revolutionary ideas and to work 
against the established order. In opposition to this radi-
cal group there has developed an amorphous coalition whose 
chief common concerns are to restore social order, stabilize 
the economy, and maintain national security. The most im-
portant components of this more moderate faction have been 
the military command structure, especially in the provinces, 
and the government administrators in Peking. 
This basic division seems to reach into the highest ranks 
of the leadership. Mao's designated successor Lin Piao, a bril-
liant military strategist who has led China's armed forces since 
1959, may have lost the allegiance of some of the old-line 
military commanders who have been attempting to administer 
China's provinces by his unwavering support for Mao's disrup-
tive social and political policies--which have included at-
tacks on the military establishment. Lin still has followers 
in the army, but his present pre-eminence derives from Mao's 
faith in his loyalty. 
Number three in the Peking hierarchy is the durable 
premier, Chou En-lai. With his fine instinct for political 
compromise and self-preservation, Chou has adroitly managed

to serve Mao while at the same time moderating Mao's more 
extreme policies. Throughout the Cultural Revolution he 
has been the chief voice of reason in China and the symbolic 
leader of the moderates. 
The other three figures in the inner circle Mao's 
longtime ghostwriter and party theoretician Chen Po-ta, 
the secret police specialist Kang Sheng, and Mao's, wife 
Chiang:Ching, have been the principal leaders of the "Cul-
tural Revolution Group"--the headquarters of the radicals. 
Mme Mao was a political nobody before the Cultural Revolu-
tion, not even a Central Committee member. When the Red 
Guards were unleashed in 1966, she quickly became the most 
vociferbus spokesman for the militants'. Public adulation 
accorded her has at times been exceeded only by that for 
Mao and Lin.' 
The next echelon of leadership has reflected the shift-
ing balance of power in the Cultural Revolution. Six of 
the eight members of the secondary elite are not even mem-
bers of the party Central Committee, an index of how rapidly 
they have risen to prominence. At levels just below this 
group figures have risen and fallen in kaleidoscopic fashion 
as the Cultural Revolution passed through phases of extreme 
radicalism or relative moderation. The eight junior. members 
of the top leadership have been associated together for less 
than a year and are themselves split politically. Five 
seem to have been identified With the radical and destructive 
aspects of the past three years--two members of the Cultural 
Revolution Group, the commander of the Air Force, and two

members of a purge group within the military. The other 
three--the political leader of Peking city, the army chief 
of staff, and the commander of the Peking garrison--have 
been more closely identified with Chou En-lai and the 
military establishment. 
This small group of 14 leaders is highly unstable. 
It will probably be able to retain its superficial unity, 
but behind the scenes its members seem to be engaged in 
political fights which are eroding its cohesion and effec-
tiveness. 
The problems of the top leadership have been com-
pounded because the Cultural Revolution has largely de-
stroyed the institutional framework in which political 
power had been embodied since 1949. The Politburo, for 
example, has been badly shaken by the purges and no longer 
represents the pinnacle of power in China. The State Coun-
cil and the party Central Committee have declined even 
further ?in importance, while the party secretariat has 
ceased to function. As a result the top leadership has 
had to rely increasingly on the army--itself strained and 
perhaps split by the events of the Cultural Revolution--to 
administer the country. 
This certainly means that the views of the military 
establishment, and particularly those commanders who are 
in direct charge, of most of China's provinces, carry a 
great deal of weight in policy formulation, but we are un-
clear how the military participate in the decision-making

process. At present the leadership is placing great emphasis 
on rebuilding the battered party apparatus in preparation 
for the long-postponed Ninth Party Congress. As this ef-
fort goes forward friction between the military, and civil-
ian party personnel is likely, further confusing lines of 
authority. 
We have little good information on how decisions are 
reached in Peking at present, or on the relative weight of 
individual members of the top leadership in the inner coun-
cils of the regime. However, some kind of consensus poli-
tics seems to be at work. In contradistinction to the sit-
uation before the Cultural Revolution when a very few top 
leaders--Mao, Chou En-lai, Mao's former deputy Liu Shao-chi 
and former party general secretary Teng Hsiao-ping--took 
quick decisions and issued orders by fiat, most important 
decisions of the top leadership seem to be the result of 
wider discussion, considerable political infighting and 
frequent compromise. 
A good example of this process was the formation--over 
a period of more than a year--of the "revolutionary commit-
tees" that now formally govern each of China's provinces. 
Political patronage considerations led to an enormous amount 
of bickering and pulling and hauling in the setting up of 
these committees, both in Peking and in the provinces them-
selves. Complex political rivalries and alliances slowed 
the process and occasionally forced the reopening of ques-
tions presumably "settled." Continued bickering has .also 
led the top leadership frequently to issue vague directives

that can be and are variously interpreted at lower levels, 
and has hindered effective follow-through on seemingly 
firm orders. 
The political demise of the Red Guards in the summer 
of 1968 has also had an effect on the formulation and im-
plementation of policy by the Peking leadership. Mao and 
his radical lieutenants now lack a ready means of stirring 
up mass action against the established bureaucracy. On the 
other hand, military commanders, who were in 1967 and 1968 
clearly opposed to the destructive activities of the Red 
Guards, may now be more willing to carry out extreme Mao-
ist social policies. Provincial military leaders who in 
1967 were themselves under Red Guard attack are now pushing 
programs that bear a "made in Peking, by Mao" label. This 
apparent accommodation may have weakened the position of 
government officials associated with Chou En-lai, who have 
a vested interest in careful planning and rational policies 
Some of these figures have recently seemed to be losing in-
fluence. 
The present leadership in Peking is in any event faced 
with enormous problems, some of long standing, and some en-
gendered by the excesses of the Cultural Revolution. It is 
most unlikely that the 14 leaders who at present are on top 
of the political pyramid in China have a common approach to 
these problems, and further political infighting involving , 
both policy questions and personal rivalries is probably 
in prospect.

LATE NOTES FOR THE PRESIDENT'S DAILY BRIEF OF 
4 MARCH 1969 
I, MAJOR PROBLEMS 
MIDDLE EAST 
The Israelis claim that there has been an upsurge of 
sniping incidents in the Suez Canal area over the past few 
days and that several soldiers have been wounded, one 
today. The Chief of the General Staff said Israel would 
take retaliatory action if the Egyptian firing continued. 
(Press, 5 Mar 69) 
EUROPE 
There is nothing significant to report. 
SOVIET AFFAIRS 
The East Germans closed the Berlin-Helmstedt autobahn 
again this morning for three hours, but as of 0700 EST 
(1300 local), traffic was moving normally on all roads be-
tween West Germany and Berlin and in the air corridors. 
One US convoy was held up on a trip from Berlin to West 
Germany. The rumored closing of checkpoints between the 
eastern and western sections of Berlin itself has not 
occurred and all are open to traffic. 
Meanwhile, the West German presidential election was 
due to get under way at 1000 local time. As of 0700 EST 
(1300 local) no results were in, but the decision of the 83 
Free Democratic members of the Federal Assembly to join the 
449 Social Democrats in backing Justice Minister Gustav 
Heinemann makes him the favorite to defeat Defense Minister 
Gerhard Schroeder of the CDU.

VIETNAM 
Except for the unsuccessful attempt by assailants, 
some dressed in South Vietnamese military uniforms, to 
assassinate Prime Minister Tran Van Huong as he left his 
office for home at the lunch hour, the situation in Viet-
nam is stable./ 
II. OTHER IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS 
SOVIET UNION - COMMUNIST CHINA 
A TASS representative in Moscow has told our embassy 
that publicity was given to last Sunday's border incident 
because the "numbers involved" made any other course unfeasible. 
He said the Soviets regard the incident as a culmination of 
and went out of his way to state 
Moscow as a deliberate political 
local tensions 
that it is not 
provocation by 
in the area 
regarded in 
Peking.
