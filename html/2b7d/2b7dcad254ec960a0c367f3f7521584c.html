 3 April 1958
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 Premier Khrushchev has re-
 tained virtually intact the pre-
 vious Soviet Council of Minis-
 ters, reinforcing earlier indi-
 cations that Nikolai Bulganin's
 demotion from premier to chair-
 man of the State Bank stemmed
 from his disloyalty to Khru-
 shchev during last June's lead-
 ership crisis.   Refurbishing of
 the "inner cabinet" by the ap-
 pointment of party presidium
 members Frol Kozlov and Anasta
 Mikoyan as first deputy chair-
 men and Iosif Kuzmin, Dmitry
 Ustinov, Aleksandr  Zasyadko,
 and Alexei Kosygin as deputy
 chairmen of the Council of Min-
 isters indicates that Khrushchev,
 while reserving for himself full
 powers in formulating policies,
 intends to delegate responsibil-
 ity for their day-to-day imple-
 mentation.   Bulganin had only
 four deputies and no first depu-
 ties.
 The elevation of Mikoya.n
 from deputy to first deputy
 premier places  him in  a  key
 position of government respon-
 sibility where he will continue
 to provide.much of the behind-
 the-scenes brain work for Khru-
 shchev.   Mikoyan, the cautious
 Armenian, whose ability for
 survival in the Soviet leader-
 ship is unmatched among the pres-
 ent top leaders, probably would
 not be considered. for a front-
 man position.
 There are some indications
 that Kozlov, who was transferred
 from party boss of Leningrad to
 chairman of the Russian Republic
 Council of Ministers last Decem-
 ber, was being groomed to replace
 Bulga.nin as premier, but  was
 designated first deputy when
 Khrushchev himself decided to
 assume the top government job.
 He nevertheless has clearly
 been promoted and is presumably
 in line for the premiership
 should Khrushchev decide to re-
 linquish it.   D. S. Polyansky,
 former first secretary of the
 Krasnodar Krai whose career has
 been spent almost entirely in
 the party apparatus, replaced
 Kozlov as premier of the Russian
 Republic.
 Of the four deputy chair-
 men, apparently only  Kuzmin,
 chairman of Gosplan, will re-
 tain a specific ministerial po-
 sition.   Zasyadko, judging by
 his background as a coal produc-
 tion expert, will probably super-
 vise the heavy industry sector.
 Kosygin will most likely bear
 primary responsibility for light
 industry, while Ustinov will
 oversee the defense industries,
 All ministers have been reap-
 pointed including Foreign Min-
 ister Gromyko, Defense Minister
 Malinovsky, Agriculture Minister
 Matskevich, Culture Minister
 Mikhailov, and MVD chief Dudorov.
 The replacement of Aleksandr
 Domrachev by Konstantin Rudnev
 as chairman of the State Com-
 mittee for Defense Technology
 and the substitution of Bulganin
 for Vasiliy Popov as chairman
 of Gosbank constitute the only
 changes among State committee
 chairmen.   General Serov remains
 as head of the KGB.  There were
 no structural changes in the
 19 ministries and the 13 state
 committees.
 The State Planning Commit-
 tee, the single most important
 economic agency in the USSR, has
 had some personnel readjustments

 department head in connection
 with his promotion to a deputy
 chairman of the Council of Min-
 isters.   Three deputy chairmen
 and three department heads of
 Gosplan were given ministerial
 rank.   The position of two other
 earlier identified deputy chair-
 men is unclear.
 Soviet Premier Khrushchev
 probably expected the unilateral
 suspension of all nuclear tests
 announced by Foreign Minister
 Gromyko to cause confusion,
 friction, and indecision through-
 out the Western world.   The So=
 viet move was intended not only
 to place further American and
 British tests in the worst pos-
 sible propaganda light, but also
 to thwart efforts to strengthen
 NATO's defenses.
 Gromyko made it clear that
 the suspension of Soviet tests
 would not be permanent unless
 Britain and the United States
 also suspend their tests.   Al-
 though he did not set any time
 limit on the suspension, he
 warned that disarmament would
 not "continue to be carried out
 unilaterally by the Soviet Union
 alone, while the Western powers
 meanwhile accumulate their arma-
 ments."            A massive Soviet prop-
 aganda attack, already fore-
 shadowed by the note delivered
 on 28 March protesting the Amer-
 ican   establishment of a danger
 zone in the Pacific for testing,
 can be expected on the American
 tests to be conducted this
 spring and summer.
 The USSR hopes that in
 Britain the test suspension will
 help left-wingers in the Labor
 party force the party to take
 a firm stand against nuclear
 weapons tests and production in-
 stead of merely advocating a
 temporary test suspension.
 In West Germany, Soviet
 propaganda and diplomacy will
 seek to strengthen efforts of
 the Social Democrats to over-
 turn the Bundestag's decision
 on 25 March to equip West German
 forces with modern weapons.
 Gromyko launched a severe at-
 tack on the "suicidal policy"
 of the Adenauer government,
 which he warned was creating a
 new obstacle not only to German
 unification but also to disarma-
 ment.   Gromyko's words fore-
 shadow an intensified bloc prop-
 aganda. campaign on this issue.
 In France, the Soviet move
 will give much-needed impetus
 to the French Communists' cam-
 paign against nuclear weapons
 and missile launching sites.
 For the last two years,
 Moscow has tried to make the
 test suspension issue the cen-
 tral and overriding problem in
 all disarmament discussions.
 This tactic is part of the con-
 tinuing Soviet effort to estab-
 lish a distinction between con-
 ventiona.l and nuclear weapons
 in an effort to neutralize the
 West's nuclear retaliatory capa-
 bilities.   It is an issue with

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 3 April 1958
 wide public appeal, which will
 be increased now that the USSR
 has suspended tests.
 The announcement of test
 suspension and Gromyko's empha-
 sis on the ease with which nu-
 clear explosions can be detect-
 ed suggest that if the issue
 becomes a subject of negotia-
 tion the USSR will put pressure
 on the United States to scale
 down its inspection requirements.
 Moscow is likely to urge that
 no inspection agreement is nec-
 essary if Britain and the United
 States follow the Soviet ex-
 ample.   In the case of nuclear
 test suspension,  as in other
 areas of disarmament, the USSR
 appears to prefer to take uni-
 lateral steps that may force the
 West to follow suit, rather than
 to sign agreements that would
 require any inspection.
 The USSR has previously
 announced troop cutbacks and
 withdrawals from Germany and
 might in the future announce a
 unilateral pledge, contingent
 on Western willingness to as-
 sume a similar obligation, not
 to use nuclear weapons or not
 to deploy them`and build missile
 bases in Europe.  Gromyko, how-
 ever, hinted that military coun-
 termeasures would be taken in
 Eastern Europe if West Germany
 is armed with modern weapons.
 Most Western European com-
 mentators have pointed out the
 propagandistic nature of the
 Soviet statement, the absence
 of provisions for controls, and
 its timing.   Government offi-
 cials received the announcement
 with a mixture of caution and
 skepticism, while opposition
 parties and press and, in gen-
 eral, the governments and press
 in the Afro-Asian world  were
 much more willing to accept the
 Russian move as a sincere step
 toward relaxation of tensions.
 In Britain the Laborites called
 on the government and the United
 States to follow the Russian
 lead.  The Times, however, de-
 clared both nations should first
 conduct their scheduled series
 of tests.   Prime Minister Mac-
 millan, pointing out the need
 for tight controls, said he was
 eager to secure agreement on
 disarmament but not at the price
 of endangering British security.
 In West Germany the govern-
 ment and virtually all segments
 of the press welcomed the Soviet
 announcement provided it is more
 than a propaganda move.  The
 progovernment press questioned
 Soviet motives while pro-Socia.l-
 iqt rapers tended to interpret
 the announceivio it as a Soviet con-
 cession on the disarmament is-
 sue, and called on the US and
 Britian to renounce testing.
 Chancellor .Adenauer, expressing
 the government's hope that the
 proposals would lead to world-
 wide controlled disarmament, said
 that, in such a case, implemen-
 tation of the Bundestag decision
 to equip the West German Army
 with atomic weapons would not be
 necessary.

 In France, where most peo-
 ple are favorably disposed to-
 ward the idea of French acqui-
 sition and testing of weapons,
 the announcement was received
 with a good deal of skepticism.
 The United Arab Republic
 welcomed the Soviet decision
 in an official statement as in
 harmony with the Bandung con-
 ference resolutions and hoped
 that it might lead to general
 agreement on ending nuclear
 tests and the.use of nuclear
 weapons.  Newspapers played up
 Gromyko's call for a similar
 step by the US and Britain and
 the West's "suspicion" of the
 Russian move.
 Australian reaction followed
 the   Western   European pattern.
 Foreign Minister Casey publicly
 advised caution but declared
 the announcement to be a move
 in the right direction if Mos-
 cow intends to negotiate a
 practical disarmament agreement
 with the West.   Opposition lead-
 er Evatt warned that the offer
 should not be distrusted as
 mere propaganda.
 In general, Japanese re-
 action to the Soviet announce-
 ment was enthusiastic.   Foreign
 Minister Fujiyama said the So-
 viet declaration was "very wel-
 come" and some Japanese offi-
 cials pointed out that though
 the proposal had obvious polit-
 ical aims, the US and Britain
 would lose the support of world
 opinion if they do not follow
 the Soviet lead in halting nu-
 clear experiments.
 Indian officials called
 the Soviet move a step toward
 relaxation of world tension,
 and Nehru is understood to have
 welcomed the news.   The Ameri-
 can arguments in favor of hold-
 ing nuclear tests as scheduled
 were denounced and the comment
 made that though the Russians
 may be somewhat ahead as a re-
 sult of their recent tests, the
 bomb, whether  ".clean"  or
 "dirty," is unlikely to be used
 unless a nation faces extinc-
 tion anyhow.
 Israeli-Syrian Border
 Incidents on the Israeli-
 Syrian border in the vicinity
 of partially drained Lake Hula
 seem likely to continue as long
 as the Israelis insist on con-
 ducting construction operations
 under heavy guard near or in-
 side the Israeli-Syrian demil-
 itarized zone.   The area has
 been the scene of serious in-
 cidents on several occasions
 in the past because of this
 kind of Israeli activity; the
 Arab reaction is the more vio-
 lent inasmuch as a substantial
 portion of the land in the Is-
 raeli-controlled demilitarized
 zone is claimed to be Arab prop-
 erty.
 While the Israelis are in
 a sense testing the reaction of
 the United Arab Republic, they
 are probably reluctant to push

 publicly  announced  it  would
 make.
 A recrudescence of activ-
 ity on the Arab-Israeli border
 seems  likely to have an impact
 on  the  situation  in Saudi
 Arabia.  So far, Crown Prince
 Faysal appears to be moving
 cautiously in exercising his
 powers, but his bitterness to-
 ward Israel remains  intense
 and this could lead the Saudi
 Government to play a more ac-
 tive role in the Arabs' anti-
 Israeli activity.   The 30-to-31
 vote of the Geneva Law of the
 Sea Conference, which in effect
 supported Israel's contention
 that it has a right to use the
 Gulf of Aqaba even though the
 whole gulf might be claimed as
 Arab territorial waters, might
 also stir the Saudis into some
 gesture  of  defiance.   Nasir
 has long sought to encourage
 the Saudis into an act of this
 kind, which presumably would
 help bring them under his own
 influence by leading them to
 seek his help.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 3 April 1958
 The westward overland drive
 of the Indonesian Government
 forces in Central Sumatra to-
 ward the rebel centers of Padang
 and Bukittinggi has slowed some-
 what because of supply difficult-
 ties, rugged terrain, and the in-
 creased dissident resistance.
 The furthest points reached at
 last report were Bangkinang on
 the Pakanbaru-Bukittinggi road,
 which was occupied on 28 March,
 and Sungai Langsat on the road
 linking Padang and South Sumatra,
 about 29 March.   The lull in
 activity may also have been im-
 posed to give the Indonesian Air
 Force an opportunity for air-
 craft maintenance and for pre-
 paring paratroops for further
 action.
 Indications of activity on
 the Tapanuli border in North
 Sumatra have been reported.
 Government troops are reported
 grouping in and around Prapat
 and dissidents around Balige.
 The local commander in Tapanuli
 has so far insisted that he is
 neutral.   He has, however, per-
 mitted dissident troops to enter
 his command and apparently to
 recruit additional forces there.
 In Padang and Bukittinggi,
 dissident leaders are dealing
 with a counterrevolution within
 their own ranks and have arrest-
 ed several officials and fired
 The revolutionary
 government is also encountering
 some reluctance among officers
 of the local Mobile Brigade;

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 UAR President Nasir is to
 visit the USSR the last week in
 April for about two weeks. His
 trip may set the stage for a
 return visit to Cairo by Khru-
 shchev.
 While Nasir is in the So-
 viet Union--he is scheduled to
 attend the May Day parade and
 to tour places as far afield
 as Tashkent--the Soviet leaders
 can be expected to use the visit
 to demonstrate the USSR's strong
 support for Nasir's brand of
 Arab nationalism and neutralism.
 Khrushchev probably will also
 take great pains to try to re-
 move Nasir's suspicions of ul-
 timata Soviet aims in the Mid-
 dle East.  Nasir himself is
 reported to desire a discussion
 of the basic Soviet stand on
 the area and to talk about the
 Palestine problem in particular.
 aid offers of high propaganda
 value even if they contain noth-
 ing essentially new.  While
 Nasir presumably does not want
 to increase Egypt's already
 heavy dependence on Soviet aid,
 economic pressures,  especially
 Egypt's critical foreign ex-
 change shortage, are likely to
 lead him to try to make some
 kind of deal to obtain hard cur-
 rencies for Egyptian cotton.
 Nasir will be vulnerable
 to Soviet persuasion and pres-
 sure in that he apparently feels
 he must balance the suppression
 of Communist elements in Syria--
 a "pro-Western" move in his vo-
 cabulary--with a pro-Soviet ges-
 ture.   He probably also feels
 under some pressure in his new
 position as head of the UAR, and
 may well wish to come home with
 some seemingly spectacular suc-
 cess for the UAR in its first

 to send Nasir home with various

 The USSR is beginning to
 implement the program called
 for by the economic aid agree-
 ments signed with Egypt and
 Syria in late 1957.   Teams of
 Soviet specialists and techni-
 cians began arriving in these
 areas during March.
 The agreements, which pro-
 vide for the first Soviet eco-
 nomic assistance loans to Syria
 and Egypt, may be adjusted and
 coordinated in the name of the
 United Arab Republic during
 Nasir's forthcoming visit to
 Moscow.   The USSR probably would
 be willing to make the neces-

 Technical Instruction arrived
 in Cairo on 26 March with eight
 assistants to discuss implemen-
 tation of an instruction pro-

 PEIPING'S m'FOREIGN AID ACTIVITIES .IN SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST ASIA
 Communist China's latest
 venture in the foreign aid
 field is a $20,000,000 loan to
 Indonesia.   Under the loan Pei-
 ping is shipping rice and tex-
 tiles worth $15,000,000 for
 sale in Indonesia, the proceeds
 to be used to finance the local
 construction costs of a textile
 factory.  With the remainder
 of the loan, the Chinese have
 agreed to supply textile ma-
 chinery to equip this plant.
 Indonesia will repay the loan
 by exports to China over a ten-
 year period.   If this arrange-
 ment proves successful, it may
 prompt other Asian countries
 to arrange for similar loans
 from China, as this program
 largely overcomes the underde-
 veloped areas' lack of domestic
 funds for economic development
 projects.
 The Indonesian loan meets
 China's short- and long-range
 goals of quickly introducing
 Chinese goods into local mar-
 kets, and, through repayment
 provisions, assures the develop-
 ment of future trade relations.
 During 1957 Peiping's f or-
 eign aid program cost about
 $185,000,000, and a similar
 amount--equivalent to 3.7 per-
 cent of China's total planned
 expenditures--has been budgeted
 for 1958.  At least 25 percent
 of this will be used to fulfill
 China's agreements with South
 and Southeast Asian countries.
 This year for the first time
 China's economic aid to free-
 world nations will include
 shipments of Chinese equipment.
 Under its new loan program,
 initiated in December 1957,
 China has already concluded
 four agreements,including the
 loan to Indonesia.   Burma is
 to receive $4,200,000 worth of
 machinery for a textile factory,
 and Ceylon is to get economic
 assistance worth $10,500,000
 for flood rehabilitation.   In
 its first moves to support the
 bloc's economic offensive out-
 side its own area of major in-
 terest in South and Southeast
 Asia, Peiping gave Egypt $5,-
 000,000 in foreign exchange fol-
 lowing the Suez crisis and con-
 cluded a $16,300,000 interest-
 free loan with Yemen in January
 1958 for Chinese steel and heavy
 machinery and technical assist-
 ance.

 anniversary speech, of provid-
 ing "sufficient" clothing  and
 footwear for the Soviet popula-
 tion within five to seven years.
 A larger program for reaching
 this goal may follow, placing
 the clothing program in step
 with the meat and milk. and
 housing programs.
 Judging from his 15-year
 forecast of footwear output in
 the above speech, however, any
 effort to match the United
 States in per capita output
 must extend well beyond seven
 years.   Khrushchev stated that,
 according to preliminary esti-
 mates, Soviet output of leather
 footwear will reach a level of
 from 600,000,000 to 700,000,000
 pairs in 15 years.   On the
 basis of the present rate of
 population increase, this would
 amount to 2.5 pairs per person,
 still below the 1957 American
 output of three pairs per
 capita.
 The five- to seven-year
 program was announced at a time
 when output of clothing and
 footwear was falling well below
 the increases required to meet
 the original 1960 goals.   Out-
 put of clothing in 1957 may
 even have declined from the 1956
 level.   Announcement of both
 this program and the decree on
 children's clothing therefore
 serves also to divert public at-
 tention from the present situa-
 tion,
 The three programs--meat
 and milk, housing, and clothing
 and footwear--were being dis-
 cussed at the time of the 20th
 party congress early in 1956.
 At that time Soviet planner
 Saburov said informally that
 the USSR could match the United
 States in food consumption in
 three years and clothing in
 seven years.   He added that the
 housing shortage could be over-
 come in ten years.  Although
 these claims were not presented
 as goals for the Sixth Five-Year
 Plan (1956-60), steps have since
 been taken to carry out certain
 features of them.   The meat and
 milk program was launched  in
 the spring of 1957 and the 10-
 12 year housing program initiated
 in the fall of 1957.
 Official statements on the
 forthcoming Seven-Year Plan
 (1959-65) emphasize clothing,
 and it is likely that the plan,
 when announced, will place more
 emphasis on light industry. This
 may already have been decided
 on, and a two-phase  program
 worked out with children's cloth-
 ing to be improved first--pos-
 sibly at the expense of adult
 clothing.   This would be fol-
 lowed by the second phase aimed
 at "satisfying" the demands of
 the entire population by the
 end of the Seventh Five-Year
 Plan (1961-1965).
 The long-range success of
 the clothing and footwear program
 will depend on the measure of
 success achieved in the expan-
 sion of agriculture and of the
 artificial and synthetic fiber
 and leather branches of the
 chemical industry, marked for
 expansion under the 1958 and
 1959-65 plans, and on the avail-
 ability ' of new, modern produc-
 tion equipment.   Further aid
 may also come from increased
 imports of raw materials from
 underdeveloped countries.

 scheduled between 27 February
 and 10 April have taken place.
 Only a few hundred troops and
 small quantities of equipment
 have been involved in  these
 ceremonies, but the number of
 trains which have departed has
 been more than sufficient to
 transport the 41,000 men the
 USSR announced would be with-
 drawn.   An uneven loading of the
 trains with men, equipment, and
 personal effects and a redistri-
 bution of equipment within the
 Group of Soviet Forces in Ger-
 many (GSFG) make an accurate
 survey impossible. No complete
 tactical unit has-been withdrawn
 from Germany.
 A reorganization of Soviet
 forces in Germany in the past
 year reduces the impact of the
 withdrawals.   Also, only trained
 Soviet personnel will be sent
 to Germany in the future whereas
 formerly one third of the per-
 sonnel in the GSFG at any one
 time consisted of raw recruits.
 The withdrawal, moreover, would
 still leave-over 300,000 Soviet
 troops in Germany.
 In Hungary,  Soviet troops
 have been withdrawn from at
 least two towns and departure
 ceremonies have taken place in
 five others.   Western observers
 have stated that complete with-
 drawal from all of these towns
 would account for most of the
 announced 17,000 reduction in
 Soviet forces.   Prior to the     25X1
 revolt in the fall of 1956, two
 Soviet line divisions were lo-
 cated in Hungary.
 BELGRADE SHOWS INCREASING PARTIALITY TO BLOC FOREIGN POLICIES
 The Yugoslav press, for
 the present at least, has aban-
 doned its position of imparti-
 ality on questions of East-West
 negotiations, even though Yugo-
 slav officials may still attempt
 to define Belgrade's interna-
 tional position as uncommitted.
 Belgrade may be responding to the
 friendly treatment accorded it
 by the Soviet press and radio
 after virtual silence since No-
 vember which had annoyed the
 Yugoslavs.   Tito may hope that
 if he increases his support, the
 bloc will be less inclined to
 condemn his ideological differ-
 ences with the Soviet camp which
 perhaps prompted his talks with
 Hungary's Kadar last week.
 Moscow's treatment of Yugo-
 slavia possibly resulted from
 Tito's complaint in a speech on
 16 March that Soviet propaganda
 was ignoring Yugoslavia, Moscow
 has since emphasized Yugoslavia's
 devotion to peace and agreement
 with Soviet policy on interna-
 tional issues such as disarma-
 ment and a summit  conference.
 It summarized the foreign-policy
 aspects of Tito's speech approv-
 ingly and commented favorably
 on the Yugoslav elections--even
 congratulating Belgrade on the
 results.
 In supporting Soviet poli-
 cy, Belgrade has been vitupera-
 tive on the subject of the estab-
 lishment of rocket bases  in
 NATO countries and nuclear arma-
 ment for West Germany.   Almost
 the only comment on the possible
 establishment of Soviet rocket
 bases in the Warsaw Pact area,
 however,   has  been a notation

 that the USSR would probably
 abandon this idea if the West
 canceled its plans.
 The West Germans are now
 the chief Yugoslav target. Most
 editorials depict German mili-

 world.   The American Embassy
 in Belgrade believes the Yugo-

 in Italy which they nevertheless

 Gromyko's announcement that the
 USSR was discontinuing nuclear
 testing.   A Yugoslav spokesman
 declared that "a negative reac-
 tion to this decision or refusal
 for motives of distrust would
 not be in the interest of peace."
 Tito undoubtedly is con-
 cerned over how the Sino-Soviet
 bloc will treat Yugoslavia's
 forthcoming party congress and
 its controversial program.   He
 may have hoped to gain some in-
 dication of the bloc's inten-
 tions by accepting Hungarian
 party leader Kadar's long-stand-
 ing invitation for a meeting.
 Likewise the announcement
 at this time that Tito  will
 make: a return visit   to   Pol-
 ish party  leader Gomulka this
 spring  appears to be   a fur-
 ther  attempt to                                                                elicit a fav-

 argued that the only cure for
 Poland's economic ills was a
 drastic overhaul, an argument
 that became more convincing as
 stopgap  measures failed to im-
 prove the situation.
 The details of the indus-
 trial decentralization plan
 were published on 11 February
 in Trybuna Ludu, the party news-
 paper.   Although there was evi-
 dence that the plan was an ac-
 commodation in part to the con-
 servatives, it nonetheless pro-
 vided for significant decentral-
 ization and liberalization in
 industrial management.   The
 structural reorganization, which
 is to be completed during 1958,
 will grant greater powers to
 the industrial enterprises them-
 selves.
 One of the steps already
 taken in the reorganization--
 the reduction of overstaffing
 in industry--was launched with
 considerable propaganda at the
 party's 11th plenum.   The cam-
 paign to justify this step was
 necessary to combat both fear
 of the resultant unemployment
 and an anticipated tendency on
 the part of enterprises to un-
 dermine the move.
 The party theoretical jour-
 nal, Nowe Drogi, explained in
 March     t the 11th plenum dis-
 cussed only the tasks to be com-
 pleted in 1958 and did not take
 up the second and third stages
 of the economic reorganization.
 The second stage--price and
 wage reform--is to be  accom-
 plished in 1959.   The third
 step to be taken envisages the
 promotion of economic competi-
 tion among state and private
 enterprises, which would force
 weak economic units to make
 profits or go out of business.
 The long delay in carrying
 out this basic economic reor-
 ganization indicates   the in-
 tensity of the controversy over
 the plan within the party. Go-
 mulka not only has secured cen-
 tral committee approval for the
 first stage, which was the most
 unpopular, but he has placed
 the party on notice that its ap-
 proval for later stages will be
 expected.   The rapid implementa-
 tion of the first stage of the
 plan, as well as the support
 publicly accorded it  by  its
 former critics, constitutes a
 victory for Gomulka in achieving
 unity within his faction-ridden
 party.   The thoroughness with
 which the regime is able to car-
 ry out the dismissal of surplus
 workers, a potential source of
 industrial unrest, will be a
 measure of Gomulka's ability
 to command the support of medi-
 um-level functionaries on whom
 he must depend for the execu-
 tion of his programs.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 3 April 1958
 CYPRUS
 Explosions and armed at-
 tacks marked 1 April, anniver-
 sary date of the campaign of
 violence by EOKA, the Greek un-
 derground organization, which
 began in 1955 and ended in
 March 1957.   The renewed vio-
 lence which began four weeks
 ago continues to be restricted
 to government installations-
 however, and British personnel
 apparently remain immune.
 The renewed sabotage coin-
 cided with initiation of a pas-
 sive resistance campaign among
 Greek Cypriots.   Despite EOKA
 threats that it would enforce a
 boycott of British goods, this
 campaign has not been particu-
 larly successful except in a
 few nationalist centers.
 Growing tension  in  the
 Greek Cypriot community over
 failure to advance toward a
 Cyprus settlement was somewhat
 dissipated by Governor Foot's
 decision to permit processions
 on Greek Independence Day--25
 March.   No serious incidents
 were reported in the separate
 demonstrations held by'left-
 and right-wing Greek Cypriots.
 In Greece, where national
 elections are now scheduled for
 11  May, the  handling of the
 Cyprus problem during the past
 two years by the government of
 former Premier Karamanlis will
 certainly be a major campaign
 issue.  Archbishop Makarios,
 still in exile in Athens, re-
 cently renewed his demand that
 Britain negotiate a settlement
 directly with the Cypriots and
 warned that unless resolved
 soon, the Cyprus issue would
 again be placed on the agenda
 of the General Assembly.
 Both London and the colo-
 nial government in Nicosia appar-
 ently feel the Cyprus problem
 must be solved soon because of
 the desire of the British peo-
 ple to rid themselves of the
 issue, the relatively concili-
 atory attitude of the Greek
 Government at this time, and
 the danger that relations with
 the Turks will deteriorate
 further.
 Turkish Cyrpiots and much
 of the press in Turkey have
 grown increasingly hostile to
 Governor Foot since British
 security forces killed several
 Turkish Cypriots in suppressing
 Turkish riots in January. Foot's
 action in permitting the 25
 March processions has given
 further impetus  to this hos-
 tility.
 AFRICAN NATIONALISTS STRENGTHEN POSITION IN KENYA
 The sweeping electoral vic-
 tories won in March by African
 Nationalists in Kenya pledged
 to the revision of the recently
 imposed constitution foreshadow
 an increase in political and
 racial tension in this British
 crown colony.   Although the
 leadership of Tom Mboya,  the
 most prominent African leader,
 has recently been repudiated by
 other African politicians, the
 unity of the Africans in dealing
 with the Kenya Government is
 probably not endangered.

 community had not been given

 leading candidates, one of whom
 is an American-educated instruc-

 College, scored overwhelming
 victories despite the opposition
 of the Kenya administration.
 Both men promised to help

 in the fertile "White Highlands"
 agricultural area.
 The victory of the nation-
 alists is likely to intensify
 their opposition to Kenya's
 present form of government which
 gives the 60,000 Europeans a
 disproportionate influence to
 that of the African population
 of about six million, but prob-
 ably does not presage a return
 to the violence of the Mau Mau
 period.
 The African campaign for
 further political advancement
 will almost certainly not find
 widespread support in Britain.
 The Conservative. government
 supports the constitution which
 it imposed last fall, and Labor
 party representatives have told
 the Africans to cooperate with
 the government if they expect
 any redress of grievances.
 Tom Mboya, secretary of the
 Kenya Federation of Labor and
 leading African spokesman since
 March 1957, was recently suc-
 cessfully challenged by other
 African leaders while he was out
 of the country in Ghana.   They
 ousted him from his position as
 leader of the elected African
 members of the legislative council.
 There does not appear to be any
 split, however, in the Africans'
 ranks over their noncooperation
 with the Kenya
 Government.
 Mboya, who
 still appears to
 be the most prom-
 ising of the Af-
 rican leaders, is
 planning to start
 an independent
 African newspaper
 and to assume open
 leadership of the
 People's Conven-
 tion party (PCP).
 Despite
 Kenya's law a-
 gainst colony-
 wide African
 parties, Mboya
 apparently hopes to transform
 the PCP, a relatively strong
 political organization restrict-
 ed  to the Nairobi area,  into
 a national organization. For
 the present he will probably
 avoid any overt organic ties be-
 tween district branches and
 thus avoid violating the Kenya
 law.   Mboya is likely to use
 weapons such as strikes, boy-
 cotts, and passive resistance,
 but will probably avoid, at
 least for the foreseeable
 future, the use of violence to    25X1
 secure concessions from the
 European settlers and Kenya
 administration.

 3 April 1958
 WEST INDIES FEDERATION FACES INSTABILITY
 The narrow margin of vic-
 tory gained by the Federal La-
 bor party (FLP) on 25 March
 will slow development of the
 new West Indies Federation's
 cohesiveness and may result in
 new elections soon after the
 formal inauguration of the fed-
 eration on 22 April, which will
 be attended by Princess Margaret.
 The FLP has 23 seats plus
 one additional supporter, com-
 pared with 21 for the Democratic
 Labor party (DLP) following the
 tentative switch to the DLP of
 two Grenada representatives
 elected under the FLP.   Further
 hard bargaining by the small af-
 filiates of the major parties
 could alter this margin even be-
 f ore the inauguration.
 If the present line-up is
 maintained, Barbados' Sir Grant-
 ley Adams will become prime min-

 ister.   The FLP's prospects for
 running a strong or stable
 government are dimmed by its
 defeat on the two major islands
 of Jamaica and Trinidad.   The
 unexpected majority gained by
 the DLP in Trinidad reflects
 the increasing political    in-
 fluence of the East Indians
 in an area of Negro dominance
 and suggests that racialism
 may develop into a cause for
 dissension.
 The defeat of the party of
 Trinidad's Chief Minister Eric
 Williams, who had demanded that
 the United States release its
 naval base at Chaguaramas for
 use as the federal capital
 site,`will probably diminish
 pressure on this issue.  Con-

 report, which is expected to
 recommend against either relo-
 cation or partition of the
 Chaguaramas base.
 The British appear to have
 been encouraging West Indian
 leaders to seek partition of
 the base, which would practical-
 ly destroy its military useful-
 ness.   The FLP might adopt this
 line, but the opposition DLP
 advocates using the deactivated
 air base of Waller Field, which
 the United States has previous-
 ly offered to release.
 The new House of Repre-
 sentatives is expected to con-
 centrate on finding a site for
 the federal capital and obtain-
 ing foreign development aid,, and
 will work cautiously toward a
 customs union and freedom of
 movement for individuals among
 the islands.   The federation
 needs to supplement its meager
 economic resources and small
 federal budget of $5,600,000.
 Adams has estimated it will
 take five years to attain a
 customs union, partly because
 of opposition from prosperous
 Jamaica, which also objects to
 freedom of movement for fear of
 an influx from the poorer
 overpopulated islands.

 SIGNS OF INSTABILITY IN PARAGUAY
 Paraguayan President
 Stroessner, the last remaining
 South American dictator, faces
 more political opposition than
 at any time since he took over
 in 1954, and he appears to have
 weakened his vital military sup-
 port.   Economic conditions, im-
 proved in part by a US-backed
 stabilization program, have
 played no significant part in
 the popular disaffection, but
 dissidence within the ruling
 Colorado party has increased
 and the Catholic church for
 the first time has criticized
 the regime.
 The loyalty of the army,
 bulwark of Stroessner's regime,
 may have been substantially
 weakened this week by the ad-
 ministration's decision to rely
 on the Colorado party's armed
 Guardia Urbana, rather than the
 army, in heading off a coup
 threatened for just before
 Easter.   The army is reported
 "tense and strongly opposed" to
 calling out the party guard.
 Such a coup, reportedly planned
 by three opposition groups

 Democracy has received in-
 creasing lip service in Para-
 guay since Perez Jimenez' oust-
 er from Venezuela on 23 January.
 Stroessner still went through
 with his own plebiscite-type
 re-election on 9 February,,but
 he has "promised" free munici-
 pal elections soon, and his
 government has  shown  unusual
 leniency toward antigovernment
 demonstrations in the past few
 weeks.
 The Catholic Church has now
 spoken out against political un-
 rest.   The Archbishop of Asun-
 cion issued a pastoral letter
 on 19 March which was concilia-
 tory in tone but spoke of wide-
 spread unrest and a crisis of
 power in government.  A parish
 priest, speaking without church
 authority, has made a series of
 highly critical speeches calling25X1
 for a general amnesty, freedom
 of speech, and more attention to
 the people's needs.
 The unity policy endorsed
 by the three major Venezuelan
 parties and the Communists when
 the Perez dictatorship was over-
 thrown in January is likely to
 be tested shortly as the gov-
 erning junta seeks their cooper-
 ation on such issues as the
 nature and date of elections for
 restoring constitutional govern-
 ment.
 The leaders of the three
 major parties--the leftist
 Democratic Action (AD), the
 leftist Democratic Republican
 Union (URD), and the moderate
 COPEI--hold divergent views on
 the election question.   Romulo
 Betancourt, leader of the AD,
 which is probably the majority
 party, has indicated his opposi-
 tion to a single state.   The
 URD has formally approved this
 arrangement, and COPEI leader
 Rafael Caldera has granted at
 least conditional approval of
 this solution to the electoral
 problem.
 Opinion similarly conflicts
 on whether the presidential can-
 didate should be nonpartisan,
 on the date of elections, and
 on the extent of participation
 of the Venezuelan Communist
 party (PCV).
 Party cooperation with the
 junta may be rendered more dif-
 ficult by the fact that pres-
 ent party leaders and their
 SECRET
 policies have not been endorsed
 and ratified by national conven-
 tions, scheduled for April or
 May.   Both Betancourt and Jovito
 Villalba, URD secretary general,
 seem to face considerable com-
 petition as spokesmen and lead-
 ers of their respective parties.
 The armed forces, divided
 into factions, are suspicious
 of growing civilian--particularly
 leftist--influence in the govern-
 ment.   They are not likely to
 attempt a coup, however, or enter
 into an open struggle with  ci-
 vilian groups because of their
 own division and especially be-
 cause the spirit of the civilian
 elements that overthrew Perez
 is still so high that widespread
 violence would probably result.

 To arrest the upswing in Con-

 bringing about the fall of a
 government through which it is
 influencing domestic economic
 policy and pursuing its long-
 range objective of building up
 a single leftist party under its
 exclusive control. The Communist
 newspaper in recent weeks has
 strongly supported the govern-
 ment's record on economic policy
 and minimized the country's eco-
 nomic problems.
 Under the circumstances,
 the government may be tempted to
 seek further foreign economic
 assistance and may find enticing
 the Soviet offer of last year
 to make the equivalent of up to
 $24,500,000 available to Iceland.
 Evidently seeking an American
 alternative, a high bank offi-
 cial has  already  informed
 American  officials  that Ice-
 land  requires  a                                                             foreign loan
 to  pay  the approximately
 $7, 500, 000  cost  of  some eight  25X1
 fishing trawlers  which are
 being contracted  for     in West-
 of the currency.  With the black
 market krona now less than half
 the official rate, the prime
 minister still will not under-
 take devaluation without the al-
 liance's cooperation.
 A unanimous desire to re-
 main in office has thus far en-
 abled the cumbersome coalition
 to overcome severe internal
 strains.   The Progressive lead-
 ers are determined to retain pow-
 er until the scheduled election
 ern  Europe.
 THE STRIKES IN SPAIN
 Strong measures taken by
 Spanish officials to curb the
 present extensive strikes are
 probably aimed as much at check-
 ing political agitation as at
 reducing economic losses from a
 spread of the walkouts. Govern-
 ment charges that the strikes
 are Communist-inspired are not
 likely to block further public
 protests against rising living
 costs.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 3 April 1958
 The government on 15 March
 suspended three articles of the
 Bill of Rights "to prevent fur-
 ther damage to the nation's
 economy" as a result of strikes
 for highor-.?pay in the Asturias
 coal fields in northern Spain.
 Following walkouts on 25 March
 at Barcelona, the local governor
 closed five factories and the
 police detained 80 workers. Ma-
 drid has announced the arrest
 of 11 persons on charges of
 being Communists and causing
 the Asturias coal strikes.   In
 addition, workers arrested in
 the strikes around Bilbao in
 April and May 1956 were report-
 edly again detained as a-precau-
 tionary measure.
 These are the strongest
 measures the government has tak-
 en since March 1957.   At that
 time the interior minister mili-
 tarized mines and conscripted
 miners because a combination
 of slowdown and walkout tactics
 by some 5,000 miners in protest
 over wage rates drastically cut
 coal production for three weeks.
 Nevertheless, in both Barcelona
 and the Asturias region, new
 incidents followed the govern-
 ment's repressive measures, and
 work stoppages were reported to
 have spread to San Sebastian
 and Valencia.   On 31 March the
 police were said to be antici-
 pating labor  outbreaks". in
 Pamplona.
 The Spanish finance minis-
 ter on 20 March expressed to
 Ambassador Lodge apprehension
 that the coal strike might cause
 rail tie-ups and industrial shut-
 downs.   He also stated that
 Spain's dollar reserves would
 reach bottom in about three
 months.
 Prolonged or extensive
 stoppages in either the trans-
 portation or industrial sector
 would probably intensify the
 present inflationary pressures.
 Labor now has lost practically
 all the gains from the November
 1956 wage boosts and it may be
 more readily brought to demon-
 strations on a nationwide scale
 forceful enough to present a
 distinct threat to the Franco
 regime.
 FIFTH CONGRESS OF THE INDIAN COMMUNIST PARTY
 The fifth congress of the
 Communist Party of India will
 be held in northern India from
 6 to 13 April in an atmosphere
 reflecting continuing Communist
 gains at the expense of Nehru's
 ruling Congress party.   Despite
 factional differences, the Com-
 munists will probably present
 an appearance of unity and a
 program with strong voter appeal.
 The major business of the
 congress will be to ratify sug-
 gested alterations in the party's
 constitution and organizational
 structure.   The party goal, for
 instance, will be redefined as
 "socialism by peaceful means."
 Though the Indian party'adopted
 constitutional tactics some
 years ago, now it is emphasizing
 that it is possibly the first
 Communist party to declare in
 its constitution that it has,
 in effect, forsworn violence as
 a party policy.
 Approval will ..also  be.
 granted for sweeping changes in
 the party leadership structure
 and membership regulations. These
 changes, some of which have al-
 ready gone into effect, are de-
 signed to make the Communist par-
 ty resemble the  Congress and
 Praja Socialist parties in or-
 ganization and to give it the

 appearance of a party with broad
 popular support rather than one
 with a tightly knit hard core.
 Expansion of party membership
 from 125,000 to 218,000 during
 the past year has been part of
 this program.
 The aim of the Communists
 in making these changes is to
 draw on their experience in the
 national election of 1957 when
 they discovered that the Con-
 gress party can be defeated
 through the ballot box by a par-
 ty championing local causes and
 campaigning intensively at the
 village level.   By presenting
 itself as a respectable, peace-
 ful organization, the Communist
 party apparently hopes to at-
 tract voters who are becoming
 increasingly disillusioned with
 the ruling Congress party.
 Further Communist election
 gains and Congress losses in the
 year since the national election
 suggests that the Communist pro-
 gram will be fairly successful.
 The Communists, already play an
 important role in the municipal
 governments of Bombay and Delhi,
 which the Congress party no long-
 er controls, and of Calcutta,
 which Congress rules by a mar-
 gin of only one seat.   Indian
 SECRET
 labor is also turning toward
 the dynamic, Communist-controlled
 All-India Trade Union Congress
 for aid in obtaining higher
 wages and better working condi-
 tions.
 There continue to be strong
 differences among Communist lead-
 ers regarding party policies
 of militancy or peacefulness.
 In some areas the party is le-
 thargic, and in most regions --U_3
 funds are insufficient.   Fac-
 tional strife in the West Bengal
 branch forced the temporary sue-
 pension of one of the party's
 leading members, and the Commu-
 nist government of Kerala State
 still has not solved any of the
 state's pressing economic prob-
 lems.
 The woes of the Communist
 party in many instances, how-
 ever, are fewer than those of
 corresponding Congress units,
 and the Communists continue to
 gain strength by default if not
 as a result of direct action.
 Communist General Secretary Ajoy
 Ghosh recently remarked that
 Congress party deterioration is
 occurring faster than the Com-
 munist organization can take
 advantage  of it.

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 CENTRAL PLANNING IN KHRUSHCHEV'S INDUSTRIAL REORGANIZATION
 The new State Planning Com-
 mittee (USSR Gosplan) emerged
 from Khrushchev's reorganiza-
 tion of industrial administra-
 tion in 1957 as the most impor-
 tant economic organ of the USSR,
 although central planning con-
 siderations were not the primary
 reasons for the reorganization.
 Gosplan now has full responsi-
 bility for specifying in detail
 the economic plans for current
 operations and for determining
 the proper balance for future
 economic development programs
 as decreed by the top leader-
 ship.   It is also responsible
 for marshaling and directing
 the economy toward these goals.
 Certain measures embodied in
 the reorganization were intended
 to correct faulty aspects of
 planning criticized by Khru-
 shchev and others.   Although
 some aspects of the reorganiza-
 tion evidently  are already
 successful, the possibility
 exists that Gosplan will bog
 down in current problems such
 as breaking supply bottlenecks.
 Gosplan's Operations
 Often described as the
 "economic general staff" of the
 Soviet state, Gosplan has the
 responsibility for preparing
 integrated national economic
 plans. Though   it is the apex
 of a, planning apparatus which
 reaches into every enterprise
 in the USSR, Gosplan, in one
 sense, is "in the middle."  It
 must resolve the conflicts be-
 tween the demands of the leader-
 ship on the economy  and the
 supply capabilities of the econ-
 omy reflected in technical and
 practical production considera-
 tions.
 Gosplan translates the
 broad directives it receives

 Gosplan also monitors implemen-

 Gosplan is organized into

 technicians draw up balance
 sheets for important products
 showing the economy's planned
 resources and requirements, in-
 cluding data on production, con-
 sumption, inventory changes,
 foreign trade, and similar fac-
 tors;  These balances are "jug-
 gled" by the planners until
 particular production plans are
 consistent among themselves and
 with other elements of the plan.
 At the same time, the plans
 must satisfy the demands of the
 leadership and be deemed feasi-
 ble.
 In addition, monetary re-
 sources and expenditures for
 various parts of the economy
 are computed to assist determina-
 tion of important over-all "pro-
 portions" within the economy.
 These also provide the basis for
 planning the state budget--a
 separately stated, though  in-
 tegral, part of the state eco-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 3 April 1958
 and many. of Stalin's organiza-
 tional changes were directed
 toward their solution.   Neither
 Stalin nor the "collective lead-
 ership" after him was notably
 successful in improving either
 the current or long-term plan..
 ning..Situation.
 By late 1956 the. situation
 had become acute.   The minis
 tries complained.  that the
 planners", unrelenting demands
 for output increases and un,
 reasoning niggardliness in al-
 locating resources were jeop-
 ardizing attainment of impor-
 tant goals of the Sixth Five-
 Year Plan.   In December, top
 planner Saburov was ousted and
 Pervukhin, his presidium-mem-
 ber successor, spoke out against
 "excessive strains"--the unre-
 lenting output demands placed
 on the economy by the leader-
 ship and blamed on the planners.
 Pervukhin's 1057 state economic
 plan reflected more reasonable
 demands by the party presidium.
 Detailed charges against
 the,planners accompanied Khru-
 shchev's theses on the reorgan-
 ization of industry and con-
 struction and the ensuing "pop-
 ular discussion" during the
 first. half of 1957.  The planners
 were.roundiy castigated for
 their alleged "mechanical ap-
 proach" to planning, for neglect
 of regionally integrated plan-
 ning, for "unrealistic" plan-
 ning, for "isolated" and "dis-
 connected" planning, and for
 other "errors" leading to major
 disproportions and looming bot-
 tlenecks.   An example cited for
 lack of regional coordination
 was the construction of a rail
 line down the Angara river
 valley just before it was to
 be inundated by the Bratsk
 hydroelectric project.
 Central Planning Revamped
 Khrushchev's doctrinal
 formulation of his 1957 reor-
 ganization in terms of strength-
 ening "democratic centralism"
 implied that the effectiveness
 of central planning and control
 must be enhanced in order to
 assure direction of the economy
 toward the goals desired by
 the.Soviet leadership.   At the
 same time, it implied the need
 for greater scope for local
 initiative to increase produc-
 tivity for further surges of
 economic gx.owth.  Improved cen-
 tral planning and control was
 to provide the counter to "local-
 ist tendencies," which were
 feared as a possible result of
 the added responsibility and
 authority given republic  and
 regional economic organs.
 Not all the top leaders
 were reassured, however.  A
 rear that perhaps irreversible
 forces might be let loose ap-
 pears to have been a. common bond
 ofi the so-called "antiparty
 group" in June 1957.
 Kirushchev, nevertheless,
 pushed ahead with his plan to
 abolish most industrial and con-
 struction ministries, replacing
 the technically specialized min-
 isterial linkage between the
 controlling "center" and the
 producing "periphery" with a new
 regional linkage through the
 republics and the new regional
 "councils of national economy"
 (sovnarkhozy).   He merged the
 central planning organs and re-
 shuffled personnel.
 Where before had existed
 neither effective mechanisms
 nor responsible agencies to
 assure regional coordination of
 planning, the new sovnarkhozy,
 together with the revitalized
 republic Gosplans, were to per-
 form integrated regional plan-
 ning, as well as administration.
 Investment, construction, and
 development of resources could
 better be viewed in relation
 to the regional economy and its
 balanced development rather than
 almost solely in terms of nation-
 wide branch-of-industry develop-
 ment.

 ning organs into a single USSR

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 3 April 1958
 Gosplan was intended to pro-
 mote continuity in planning
 and consistency between suc-
 cessive annual plans" and ' the
 longer range plans.   In draft-
 ing the 1958 plan, the plan-
 ners had available to them
 the guidelines for the 1959-
 1965 plan and had simultane-
 ously drawn up a rough pre-
 liminary 1959 annual plan.
 Presumably these, as well as
 preliminary 1957 plan fulfill-
 ment data, were taken .'.into
 account in the detailed draft-
 ing'of the 1958 plan.  Not=
 withstanding the seeming com-
 plexity of these procedures,
 the 1958 plan was promulgated
 prior to the beginning of the
 new year--an  unusual achieve-
 ment.  This timely planning
 may.well have been facilitated
 by the fact that some impor-
 tant Gosplan department heads
 under the new system held seats
 on the USSR Council of Minis-
 ters.
 Branch-of-industry plan-
 ning was unequivocally fixed
 in Gosplan, with the determin-
 ation of "correct proportions"
 for branch development improved
 by the transfer to appropriate
 departments in Gosplan of for-
 mer ministerial leaders *ho
 could provide a cadre of knowl-
 edgeable:specialists to assure
 more "realistic" and less "me-
 chanical" planning.  Gosplan
 itself was responsible for-de-
 velopment planning of indus-
 tries and had to resolve mat-
 ters without recourse to blus-
 ter.
 Central Planning Appraised
 The early operation of
 the new.organs pointed up the
 neglect of regional coordina-
 tion that had existed.  Though
 the abolition of most indus-
 trial ministries eliminated the
 traditional wrangling between
 the ministries and the central
 planning organs, new difficul-
 ties became apparent almost at
 once between the central plan-
 ners and the regional planners
 and administrators.  The con-
 flict about a particular planned
 action tended to involve their
 varying viewpoints--branch-of-
 industry integration versus
 regional integration of eco-
 noiimio activity.   Final say,
 neyertheless, rested with Gos-
 plan.
 Despite the reported in-
 creases in economic output
 claimed under the first months
 of operation of the new system,
 the long-term effectiveness of
 the new Gosplan in coping with
 the increasing complexity of
 the economy remains to be dem-
 onstrated.  Gosplan must still
 present an acceptable draft
 plan for the 1959-1965 period
 and follow through its imple-
 mentation.
 The timeliness and seem-
 ing realism of the 1958 annual
 plan are not necessarily at-
 tributable solely to improve-
 ments in Gosplan technique or
 organization.   They could well
 result from the fact that plan-
 ning now is in the hands of
 men with recent close ties with
 the producing elements of the
 economy.  The test will come
 when their practical experience
 becomes obsolete, less and less
 relevant to newly emergent
 planning problems sure to de-
 velop.   Will Soviet central
 planning then be able to avoid
 becoming once again "unrealis-
 tic" and "mechanical?"
 If Gosplan can avoid bog-
 ging down in current  opera-
 tional problems--if long-term
 disproportions can be skirted
 in the search for solutions to
 current supply bottlenecks--
 the reorganized structure of
 Soviet central planning may
 well, for a time at least, pro-
 vide improved planning in sup-
 port of further Soviet eco-
 nomic growth.

 COMMUNIST CHINA LAUNCHES PROGRAM TO MODERNIZE AGRICULTURE
 Communist China is in the
 early stages of an effort to
 modernize its traditional agri-
 culture.                          Its ability to feed
 its tremendous population--
 estimated at about 643,000,000
 and growing at a rate of about
 15,000,000 a year--and at the
 same time to pursue a program
 to become a modern industrial
 nation hinges on the success
 of this undertaking.   In the
 final analysis China's indus-
 trialization program, includ-
 ing the importation of needed
 machinery,  is paid for primar-
 ily by agriculture.

 China.
 Most of these are
 lo-
 cated on
 large state farms
 in
 northern
 Manchuria and in
 Sin-
 kiang.
 The first China-made
 tractor
 is to be turned out
 this year in Tientsin. A large
 tractor factory in Loyang with
 a capacity of 15,000 tractors
 a year is to go into operation
 in 1959, a year ahead of sched-
 ule.   A plant to build small
 ten-horsepower tractors will be
 finished at Nanchang in 1959.
 Various machinery plants will
 start this year turning out
 large numbers of small, garden-
 type tractors similar to those
 used by America's suburban
 farmers, appropriate in a coun-
 try where much of the land is
 hilly and where paddy farm-
 ing is important.
 Provincial and local gov-
 ernments have been given the
 major responsibility for step-
 ping up the supply of improved
 farm implements and tools.
 Peiping says that agricultural
 output might increase  by as
 much as 20 percent through wide-
 spread use of moldboard-type
 plows which plow deeply and
 turn the soil properly.   Ma-
 chinery factories, many of
 them built and operated by lo-
 cal enterprises, are sched-
 uled to turn out various types
 of powered implements, such as
 pumps for irrigation purposes,
 to add 590,000 horsepower to the
 Chinese countryside during 1958--
 roughly double the output of
 power equipment now in use.
 The regime plans to raise
 yields also by increasing the
 acreage of irrigated land, by
 extending the double-cropped
 areas farther north, and by ex-
 panding the acreage planted to
 high-yield crops. Ac-
 cording to a deputy
 minister of water con-
 servancy, irrigated
 acreage is to be dou-
 bled by 1962, to the
 point where two thirds
 of the nation's culti-
 vated land would be
 irrigated.   Millions
 of hands will be at
 work on millions of
 small water conser-
 vancy projects, while
 the state will con-
 tinue work on major
 conservancy measures
 such as the Huai River
 Project.   Plans are   .
 being drawn up to car-
 ry out basin-wide con-
 servancy projects on
 both the Yangtze and
 Yellow rivers.
 In connection with its
 plans for double-cropping and
 high-yield planting, Peiping
 will experiment with improved
 strains of seeds.   The author-
 ities are encouraging every lo-
 cality to set aside experimental
 plots in which better seeds and
 farming methods may be tested
 for applicability to local con-
 ditions.   More attention to con-
 trol of crop diseases and in-
 sects is being urged, and the
 regime has taken steps to pro-
 vide more insecticides and
 equipment for their applica-
 tion.
 Almost all of China's
 277,000,000 cultivated acres
 are farmed intensively by tradi-
 tional methods.   The human be-

 of all power.   The number of

 Dike construction at Tungting Lake in Hunan Province
 draft animals is inadequate,
 and there is practically no
 mechanical power. The possi-
 bilities for opening up new
 lands are limited by geography,
 climate, and the heavy costs
 involved. Furthermore, efforts
 to introduce modern techniques
 have encountered the backward-
 ness of a largely illiterate
 peasantry.   In 1956, for ex-
 ample, Peiping unloaded on
 the peasants more than a mil-
 lion and a half
 steel plows. Most
 of these plows found
 no market at all.
 Those which reached
 the countryside
 were quickly dubbed
 "wall plows" in tes-
 timony of a strong
 peasant tendency
 to hang them on pegs
 in the wall rather
 than use them in the
 fields.
 The minister of
 agriculture recently
 launched a campaign
 to overcome what he
 termed the "ideo-
 logical problem"
 which make these
 plows unpopular.
 In addition, Peiping
 has plans to expand agricul-
 tural extension work so that
 a scientific and technical in-
 formation office will be es-
 tablished in every hsiang (an
 area smaller than a county,
 composed of several villages).

 deteriorating; the equipment
 and materiel they are using in
 North Africa is rapidly wear-
 ing out, and reserve stocks are
 being exhausted.   After more
 than a decade of fruitless over-
 seas warfare on top of the hu-
 miliation of 1940, the army's
 core of regulars is fatigued
 and its morale is declining.
 Only 32 :'of 42 ,French front-
 line air force squadrons prom-
 ised in the 1957 NATO force
 goals are available-in Europe.
 Algerian requirements and pre-
 vious budgetary cuts have se-
 verely curtailed operational
 training and flying  in  the
 French Air Force and reduced
 its standards below  minimum
 SHAPE readiness requirements.
 Air force budget cuts have re-
 sulted'in a 50-percent reduc-
 tion in the monthly production
 of bombers, fighters, transports,
 and helicopters and in a  se-
 vere restriction of research
 and development.   The transfer
 of 10,000 men frorh the air force
 to shore up army units in Al-
 geria has dealt a severe blow
 to air force morale.
 The navy has been obliged
 to abandon its major-unit con-
 struction program, which in-
 cluded a proposed third aircraft
 carrier.   Naval air budgetary
 cuts mean further delay in ob-
 taining modern jet fighters.
 Military Reappraisal
 The latest attempts to
 juggle the military budget are
 bringing to a head a number of
 festering problems involving
 both interservicefriction and
 civilian-military disagreement.
 General Paul Ely, chief of the
 Armed Forces Staff, has served
 notice on  Defense 'Minister
 Chaban-Delmas that he will re-
 sign unless an additional $186,-
 000,000 is added to the $3.15
 billion defense budget to help
 maintain France's NATO contri-
 bution, continue the pacifica-
 tion of Algeria, and restore
 the gutted arms construction
 programs..  The air force chief
 of staff and two air force gen-
 orals in charge of aircraft pro-
 duction have already quit, and
 the Defense Ministry is reported
 "fighting off" numerous other
 threatened-resignations.
 The French commander in
 chief in Algeria wants more re-
 inforcements,  but there is evi-
 dence of increasing discontent
 among younger officers over the
 question of whether resources
 already in Algeria have  been
 properly utilized.   A prominent
 paratrooper, Lt. Col.  Marcel
 Bigeard, has openly criticized
 the government and the army
 high command.   He charged that
 the bulk of the French ground
 forces in Algeria is tied up
 in guard and patrol duty, leav-
 ing only 10 percent for offen-
 sive operations against the
 rebels.   Bigeard was reassigned
 at Chaban-Delmas' request to
 train special cadres of young
 officers in techniques of com-
 bating "revolutionary war," and
 his transfer has been given un-
 usual publicity by the govern-
 ment.   This move is probably
 indicative of the government's
 sensitivity to the political
 implications of public criticism
 from the military at this time.
 The continuous pressure
 from rightist elements for an
 expanded Algerian offensive has
 recently aroused concern  in
 France over the nation's weak-
 ened European defense posture.
 The press has aired the issue,
 and an authoritative military
 correspondent for the influen-
 tial Paris daily Le Monde ques-
 tions whether. ?France- wwill prac-
 tically cease furnishing any
 military contribution to NATO."
 He points out that French air-
 craft plants are releasing many
 engineers and technicians, in-
 cluding some Germans who will
 presumably be taken on by the
 expanding West German plane in-
 dustry.   In an obvious effort
 to stir public opinion,   he
 raises the possibility of Ger-
 man squadrons manning some NATO

 attempts to inform and educate
 the peasants, Peiping intends
 to make use of the large number
 of surplus cadres and office
 workers--more than 1,300,000
 at last count-,who have been
 sent back to the countryside
 to "engage in production."
 A shortage of petroleum
 is a serious handicap in China's
 program to mechanize agriculture.
 Wide  use  of . farm . machinery
 powered by gasoline,is=inap=
 'propriate in a country where
 regular highway transport is
 curtailed because of a shot-
 age of petroleum products, and
 Peiping has made provision:to
 develop machinery using alter
 .native sources of power such
 as coal.  But at best this  -
 provides only a partial solu-
 tion of the problem.
 The problem of supplying
 highly technical equi ifibnt to.
 the fertilizer industry appears
 to be 'a: critical point in the
 regime's program to expand fer-
 tilizer output.   Its. acquisi-.
 tion from abroad would be cost-
 ly and difficult.  Although
 China has produced prototypes
 of certain important'pieces_
 of  equipment;   the  Cl}inese.
 will have difficulty in pro-
 ducing such machinery in.large
 quantities.
 Repair and maintenance Of
 equipment once it reaches the
 countryside  present   other
 problems.   Spare parts for im-
 ported equipment are in chronic
 Short  supply  and  mechanical
 skills and machine facilities
 are lacking.  A high government
 official closely connected with
 this .,.problem has . remarl~ed,
 "When the peasants won't work,
 we preach Marxism-Leninism',
 when the draft animals won't
 work, we whip them; but when
 the machines won't work, we are
 at our wit's end."
 Prospects
 Peiping's program for mod-
 ernizing Chinese agriculture is
 a long-range one.   Mao Tse-tung
 has indicated that the country
 would be doing well to accom,
 plish the technical reform of
 its agriculture by 19766.  Even
 then, judging by the outlines
 of the present program, the
 regime does not appear to vis-
 ualize 4n agriculture which
 uses large mechanized equip-
 ment on, a scale approaching
 that of the United States or
 the Soviet Union,   China's
 problem is, in fact, almost
 the opposite-of that faced by
 the Soviet Union.   China, with
 its immense reservoir of man-
 power, feels no pressing need
 to release rural labor for
 employment 'in industry.   Its
 industry does not, and will
 not'for the foreseeable` future,
 be able to absorb a significant
 fraction.of the annual addi-
 tions to the labor force.
 The regime has shown an
 increased awarenes that it
 can learn much from Japanese
 experience:   Several delega-
 tions have gone, from Peiping
 in the past several months to
 study Japanese farm technology.
 and the chemical fertilizer
 industry.   The result will
 probably be a widening use in
 China of chemical fertilizers,
 farm implements adapted for
 local conditions, and small
 powered machinery.
 There is littla doubt
 that the modernization program
 beginning to emerge in China
 will result in substantial ad-
 ditions to agr.culturalloutput.
 Just how far and how fast the
 regime will be willing and able
 to go depends on the ultimate
 cost of the program.   It is
 certain that the program will
 be expensive and that it will
 have an impact on other detie]op-
 ment schemes.  Peiping will
 strive to minimize this impact
 because, fond as it is of agri-
 culture, it is even fonder of
 industry,and has shown no signs
 of a''willingness to give indus-
 try a back seat.   If the pro-
 gram is implemented along the
 general lines now emerging;
 however, it will make more
 reasonable some of Peiping's
 .long-range agricultural goals,
 which have in the past seemed
 well out of reach.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 2 April ],958
 FRANCE'S MILITARY PROBLEMS
 Premier Gaillard's insist-
 ence on maintaining his ceiling
 on 1958 military expenses de-
 spite increased Algerian war
 costs has forced a reallocation
 of defense budget funds which
 has further weakened French
 NATO commitments and has aroused
 violent reactions among France's
 armed forces chiefs`.   The cuts
 in arms production funds jeop-
 ardizes the maintenance of a
 balanced defense establishment,
 and the developing civilian-
 military friction may stimulate
 military participation in French
 politics.
 The Budgetary Dispute
 The inevitable collision
 between Gaillard's austerity
 program and the growing costs
 .of the Algerian war finally oc-
 curred in early March.   The
 premier's stringent budget re-
 trenchment program--which held
 defense expenditures to $3.15
 billion had been accepted by
 the National Assembly in late
 1957 because most deputies re-
 alized its inadequacies would
 soon be apparent.   By early
 1958, the armed services faced
 the prospect of cutting their
 consumption of goods and serv-
 ices approximately 25 percent
 because of budgetary reductions
 and price increases as compared
 with 1957.   This, plus  the sub-
 sequent deterioration of the
 military situation in Algeria,
 obliged Gaillard to agree to
 find an  additional $225,000,-
 000 for the Algerian war.
 New taxes were violently,
 opposed by the proponents of
 strong measures in Algeria,
 however, and they insisted on
 economies within the budgetary
 framework.   The armed forces
 felt the extra funds could easi-
 ly be found in the budgets of
 the civilian ministries, but
 since many Socialists and a
 growing minority in the center
 parties were convinced that ad-
 ditional defense appropriations
 would be pointless if they were
 to be swallowed up in Algeria,
 Gaillarq was in no position to
 further `limit the funds of the
 civilian ministries.
 The right was able to in-
 sist on reallocation of mili-
 tary expenditures without di-
 rectly affecting nonmilitary
 commitments, because in 1958,
 .for the.first time, the mili-
 tary budget includes the Alger-
 ian pacification costs,   the
 bulk of which was formerly cov-
 ered by special appropriations
 separate from the "ordinary"
 military budget.   The arms pro-
 duction programs have borne the
 brunt of this redistribution
 to date.   Other military activ-
 ities are in danger. of curtail-
 ment, however, since Gaillard's
 expressed hope of securing $43,-
 000,000 in support costs from
 West Germany is hardly likely
 to be realized.
 The Algerian Drain
 The shuffling of defense
 programs is focusing increasing
 attention on the incongruity
 of instituting a policy of budg-
 etary austerity in the face of
 the expanding requirements. of
 an active military campaign.
 A disproportionate share-of
 France's armed manpower resources
 is now concentrated in  North
 Africa, mostly,  Algeria: ap-
 proximately half of all French
 ground forces and a third of
 the air force and navy.
 Ten of the 13 French NATO-
 committed  divisions are mired
 in the North African operations
 and could not conceivably meet
 SHAPE'S requirements for avail-
 able effective units in Europe.
 within 30 days after M-day. Most
 of the troops in North Africa,
 regardless of special skills
 and training,  are serving as
 infantrymen and would require
 considerable retraining for mod-
 ern war operations.   The heavy
 equipment they left in Europe is
