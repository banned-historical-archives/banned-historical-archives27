 REACTION TO PRESIDENT EISENROWER'S TRIP   .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  Page 1
 Soviet treatment of President Eisenhower's trip has
 been limited to factual news coverage and generally mod-
 erate and at times favorable commentary.  Moscow has
 adopted a restrained tone, claiming that the trip is an
 effort to resolve Western differences.  The European sat-
 ellites have only mildly criticized the President's activ-
 ities.   In sharp contrast to Moscow's treatment, Peiping
 has bitterly attacked the President's trip as a "smoke
 screen" to cover preparations for war.
 SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS     .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 4
 The divergence between Moscow and Peiping in their
 t:~aatment of the President's trip reflects the frictions
 and policy differences between the two regimes.               Khru-
 shchev's thinly veiled criticism of Chinese policies in
 three recent major speeches reflects his determination to
 restore bloc discipline and unity behind Moscow's lead.

 Iraqi anti-Communist elements, embittered by what
 they regard as another shift of Prime Minister Qasim to-
 ward favoring the Communists, may hasten efforts to over-
 throw or assassinate him.                     The anti-Communists still do
 not appear well organized, however, and another abortive
 attempt would probably redound further to the advantage of
 the Communists.  The UAR is becoming concerned over Israeli
 plans to utilize large amounts of Jordan River water.
 Iranian-Soviet discussions continue regarding the preclu-
 sion of foreign military  bases  from  Iran,

 NUCLEAR TEST CESSATION TALKS .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 1
 Soviet representatives at the Geneva talks are seek-
 ing to maintain pressure for an early settlement of out-
 standing issues.   Soviet delegate Tsarapkin publicly
 charged the United States and Britain with "dragging their
 feet" and privately stressed the need for "mutual conces-
 sions," hinting that the USSR might relax its insistence
 on an unconditional cessation of all tests if the technical
 experts fail to reach agreement.  The Soviet experts in the
 technical talks continued to defend the validity of the
 control system recommended by the 1958 Geneva experts' con-
 ference.  Moscow, however, may be willing to accept minor
 adjustments in the 1958 report which would not alter the
 basic conclusion that a control system is technically
 feasible.
 HUNGARIAN PARTY LEADERSHIP ENDORSED  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .       Page 2
 Hungary's first party congress since the 1956 revolt
 concluded in Budapest on 5 December and gave the expected
 solid endorsement to the leadership of party First Secre-
 tary Kadar.  This was reinforced by Khrushchev's presence
 and his warm praise for Kadar and his policies.       A lim-
 ited number of personnel changes made in central party
 organs by Kadar should make the party more responsive to
 his direction, although there continue to be certain
 weaknesses.
 EAST GERMAN REGIME TROUBLED BY FOOD SHORTAGES   .
 .  Page 4
 A number of East German party and government offi-
 cials are being made scapegoats for the current shortages
 of meat and dairy products.  Party First Secretary Ulbricht
 may extend the shake-up as a means of getting rid of offi-
 cials who have questioned his agricultural policies.  De-
 spite the loss of prestige, the regime has been forced to
 restrict the sale of butter and is taking drastic steps to
 control hoarding and smuggling of foodstuffs.
 SOVIET AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT IN 1959 .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 5
 Unfavorable weather, including a drought this summer,
 reduced the yields of most Soviet crops.   The grain crop
 suffered from a reduction in sown acreage as well and ap-
 parently was the smallest in five years, or since the
 development of the New Lands.  The cotton crop, on the
 other hand, grown under irrigation and not affected by
 the dry weather, apparently was a record crop.  The out-
 put of livestock products may rise some 10 to 20 percent

 this year, largely because substantial feed supplies have
 been-available from last year's bumper harvest.  The grain
 shortfall this year will be reflected in next year's out-
 put of livestock products.
 PEIPING RELEASES WAR CRIMINALS .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  Page  7
 Thirty former Nationalist officials are among the 33
 "war criminals" released by Peiping on 4 December as part
 of a continuing effort to undermine the stability of the
 Taiwan government by holding out the prospect of pardons
 for Kuomintang officials.  The restoration to good stand-
 ing of a large number of "rightists" criticized during the
 "rectification" campaign of 1957-58 at the same time em-
 phasizes, for the benefit of critics of the regime, Pei-
 ping's policy of rehabilitation and redemption.  There has
 been no indication that amnesty will be granted to American
 prisoners in China.
 SINO-INDONESIAN TENSIONS .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .   Page  8
 The Indonesian Government, determined to carry out
 its ban on rural alien retailers despite strong Chinese
 Communist objections, has reaffirmed its deadline of 1
 January for implementation of the decree.           Personnel of
 the Chinese Communist Embassy in Djakarta are disregard-
 ing a ban on their travel to troubled areas and are en-
 couraging Chinese resistance to government resettlement
 efforts.  Despite continuing difficulties, neither Peiping
 nor Djakarta seems likely to press the situation to the
 point of breaking relations.
 CEYLON .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  9
 The dissolution of Ceylon's Parliament on 4 December
 and the scheduling of new national elections for 19 March
 have temporarily ended uncertainty over day-to-day polit-
 ical developments.  Prime Minister Dahanayake will head
 a caretaker government until the elections.                     Preoccupa-
 tion with campaign activities may stimulate some unrest
 and probably will postpone for another three or four
 months any effort to solve pressing economic problems.
 It appears that no single party will obtain a majority in
 the new 151-member Parliament, although moderate elements
 seem confident of winning considerable support.

 postponement.     Basic frictions, however, will continue to
 pose a threat to the Phoui government.  The military sit-
 uation remains generally calm, and the UN team in Laos has
 begun drafting its preliminary economic survey.
 MALI INDEPENDENCE ARRANGEMENTS .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 11
 De Gaulle and leaders of the Mali Federation--com-
 posed of the autonomous French Community states of Senegal
 and Soudan--appear to have agreed in principle that by
 June 1960 Mali should be independent, but with special con-
 tractual ties to France in such fields as defense, foreign
 affairs, education, and economic aid.   Serious discord
 exists, however, as to when these ties are to become ef-
 fective, and differences seem likely to develop over sub-
 stantive aspects as well.  Concessions by Mali's present
 leaders should be exploited by more militant domestic ele-
 ments who favor a complete break with the Community.
 SAHARAN OIL AND THE COMMON MARKET   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 12
 The formal inauguration on 5 December of the pipeline
 from central Algeria to the Mediterranean coast coincides
 with accelerated French efforts to find a market for Saha-
 ran oil in the European Economic Community  (EEC or Common
 Market).  Most of the Common Market countries have serious
 misgivings about a French plan to impose an EEC internal
 tax on oil products not refined from "Community" crude,
 thus giving preference to French supplies. The French can
 probably have their way, however, if they offer sufficient
 inducements and make the matter an issue for Common Market
 "solidarity."
 BRITAIN'S RELATIONS WITH WESTERN EUROPE   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 14
 The Macmillan government's proposal that the Western
 European Union--the one body composed of the six Common
 Market countries plus Britain--be used for political con-
 sultation is a further effort to discourage extension of
 six-nation solidarity, while proclaiming that Britain is
 "part of Europe."  British support of France on African
 issues and the Anglo-German defense production arrangement
 recently agreed to also reflect the current drive to im-
 prove Britain's relations with major Western European
 allies.

 CONTINUING DIFFICULTIES IN US-PANAMANIAN RELATIONS .  .  .  .  Page 15
 The Panamanian Government may soon publicize its
 disappointment with the results of recent discussions of
 US-Panamanian differences and its charges that the United
 States has made no substantial concessions regarding the
 Canal Zone.   In view of the continuing efforts of extrem-
 ists to provoke new anti-US disorders, publication of a
 strongly worded official statement--as threatened by the
 Panamanian foreign minister--would increase the likelihood
 of further difficulties in US-Panamanian relations.  Nation-
 alistic student elements are reported organizing     anti-
 US demonstration for 12 December.
 BRAZIL PRESSES "OPERATIQN PAN AMERICA" .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  Page 16
 Brazil is intensifying its diplomatic campaign to
 build support for "Operation Pan America" (OPA), Presi-
 dent Kubitschek's proposal for a "dynamic" inter-American
 effort to speed economic development.  Kubitschek con-
 siders such an effort essential to combat increasing Com-
 munist agitation as well as to meet the needs of the ex-
 panding population in Latin America.  OPA has gained inter-
 American support this year and is popular in Brazil.   In-
 fluential opinion in Brazil sees this plan and the current
 trade mission to Moscow as the beginning of a policy of
 greater independence from the United States and giving
 Brazil an opportunity to exert greater influence in world
 affairs.
 GUATEMALAN CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS .  .  . .  . . .  .  .  .  . .  Page 17
 The government of Guatemalan President Miguel
 Ydigoras has been temporarily strengthened by the results
 of the 6 December congressional election in which half of
 the 66 seats were at stake.  The President appears assured
 of a majority in the new congress, which he lacked during
 his first two years in the presidency.  The rightist op-
 position party suffered serious losses in the election,
 and the leftist opposition, although still strong, is
 split by factionalism encouraged by the President.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 10 December 1959
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 COMMUNIST CHINA'S RELATIONS WITH THE NON-COMMUNIST WORLD .  Page 1
 Communist China's determination to convey an immedi-
 ate impression of strength is a major influence in its re-
 lations with non-Communist countries and in its reluctance
 to go along wholeheartedly with Moscow's recent peace ini-
 tiatives.                       The Chinese apparently believe the Kremlin's
 "detente" approach,  if followed by the weaker Peiping re-
 gime, would tend to freeze the status quo in the Far East,
 leaving unfulfilled such paramount Communist aspirations
 as the "liberation" of Taiwan.   In addition, the Chinese
 consider a "struggle" atmosphere as essential to the de-
 velopment of their domestic economy to the levels of the
 more industrialized countries.   Hence their assertion that
 Peiping, as a strong nation, is receptive to "peaceful"
 solutions but ready to back its claims by power.
 FRENCH OVERSEAS AID PROGRAM   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 5
 France's ability to maintain strong ties with its
 overseas areas, particularly Algeria, will depend to a
 large extent on the scope of the French economic and so-
 cial aid program.  French economic assistance to Algeria
 and to members of the French Community may exceed
 $400,000,000 in 1960.  Even if De Gaulle's five-year Al-
 gerian economic development program is successful, Algeria's
 continuing economic assistance requirements will be stagger-
 ing.           The European Economic Community can provide some
 capital to fill the gap, but De Gaulle will probably de-
 mand--perhaps at a summit meeting--broad international co-
 operation to provide the necessary,. funds.
 CUBA UNDER FIDEL CASTRO   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 8
 Prime Minister Fidel Castro's frequently stated ob-
 jective is the rapid imposition of drastic social and
 economic reforms so as to improve the lot of Cuba's low-
 est income groups and, by a more efficient organization
 of production, to produce more wealth and a greater degree
 of economic self-sufficiency.  He uses these objectives to
 justify the establishment of tight controls over the econ-
 omy.  Under the land reform program, extensive holdings
 have been taken over without formal expropriation or com-
 pensation and turned into cooperatives under control of

 build an authoritarian political machine based on mass

 oriented advisers, and Communists are benefiting from the
 demagogic tirades against the United States that Castro
 uses to mobilize his mass following.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 OF IMMEDIATE'INTEREST
 REACTION TO PRESIDENT EISENHOWER'S'TRIP
 Soviet media are covering
 the President's activities by
 combining reasonably factual
 news coverage with moderate and
 at times commendatory commen-
 taries. Prior to the President's
 departure,  Soviet commentators
 established the general line
 that the tour was the latest
 move in a flurry of Western
 diplomatic activity aimed at
 reconciling Western divergen-
 cies before the Western summit
 meeting in Paris on 19 Decem-
 ber.   While comment directed
 to both domestic and foreign
 audiences during the trip has
 taken a favorable view, propa-
 gandists have continued to note
 "conflicting tendencies" in the
 West which make the President's
 task of establishing a unified
 approach to a summit meeting
 "very difficult."
 Moscow has published fac-
 tual summaries of each communi-
 qud issued at the conclusion
 of the President's talks.   Com-
 menting on the visit to Rome,
 Izvestia portrays the President
 as a man of "good will," who,
 together with Khrushchev,
 "opened the way at Camp David
 to a normalization of the in-
 ternational situation."  A more
 discordant note, however, was
 sounded in a 7 December broad-
 cast, which objected to the im-
 plication in the Rome communi-
 qud that the policy of estab-
 lishing missile bases in Italy
 would be continued.   Moscow al-
 so alleges a failure to reach
 "full unanimity" in the Rome
 meeting.
 In dealing with the visit
 to Ankara, Moscow avoided the
 subject of missile bases, and
 limited its comments to censur-
 ing Turkish leaders for their
 efforts to persuade the Presi-
 dent "to revert to his former
 firm policy."  Pravda and
 broadcasts for internal audi-
 ences suggest that the Ankara
 communiqud revealed US-Turkish
 differences over full US mem-
 bership in CENTO.
 Moscow's commentary on
 subsequent phases of the trip
 has continued to be relatively
 amicable in tone, with no di-
 rect criticism of the President.
 A broadcast on the communiqud
 issued in Karachi noted a fail-
 ure to mention such problems
 as relaxation of tension and
 disarmament.
 Eastern European propa-
 ganda media are making only
 brief mention of the President's
 arrivals, departures, and meet-
 ings, mostly in newscasts on
 the home service.  Except in
 Poland,  Satellite newspapers
 are giving little attention to
 the trip.   In general the com-
 mentaries are more friendly
 toward the United States than
 usual, especially those in East
 Germany, which used the occa-
 sion to intensify propaganda
 against West Germany--Adenauer
 specifically--as the chief op-
 ponent of peace but to place
 the United States, Britain, and
 France on the side of "good"
 with Khrushchev and East Germany.
 A Czech commentator, how-
 ever, cautioned that the Dulles

 foreign policy may be so en-
 trenched that the President's
 attempt to turn over a new leaf
 may be too late.  The Czech
 noted that the President's
 peaceful intentions and the
 spirit of Camp David are at
 variance with the inclusion of
 Iran and Spain on the itinerary,
 continuation of the arms race,
 and continued establishment of
 bases abroad.
 In contrast to overt media,
 clandestine broadcasts emanat-
 ing from bloc countries, but
 not acknowledged by the regimes,
 have carried denunciations of
 the trip's purpose and of the
 President personally.  A broad-
 cted to Turkey
 harged that the visit
 ra gave the President
 an opportunity to "see his
 servile followers and give them
 fresh directions."  It said
 Turkey has been reduced to the
 status of a "dependent and en-
 slaved country."                    Some clan-
 destine stations, however, con-
 trast the President's peaceful
 aims with the aggressive pol-
 licies of the leaders he is
 meeting.
 Peiping's Reaction
 Moscow's conciliatory cov-
 erage of the trip contrasts
 sharply with Peiping's bitter
 attacks.  A broadcast on 2 De-
 cember from China charged the
 President with employing peace-
 ful overtures as a "ruse" in
 an effort to "gain time to ex-
 pand American military strength"
 in furtherance of an aggres-
 sive war policy.   In a similar
 vein three days later, Peiping
 dismissed US efforts to reduce
 tensions as a "smoke.; screen"
 to cover up preparations for
 war.   A broadcast of 7 Decem-
 ber stressed that the US-Turk-
 ish communique revealed that
 "new plots" were being hatched
 to create tensions in the area.
 The Chinese Communists,
 are apparently concerned that
 the President's trip will un-
 dercut their contention that
 the United States is solely re-
 sponsible for maintaining a
 state of tension in the Far East.
 Chinese leaders have recently
 endeavored to convince foreign
 visitors that Peiping  has

 "peaceful" intentions in the
 Taiwan Strait.
 Asia-Africa
 Pro-Western leaders and
 the press in free Asian and
 African countries have almost
 unanimously approved of the
 President's trip and applauded
 the popular receptions he has
 enjoyed thus far.  The few sour
 notes derive from wounded pride
 --as in the case of Jordan,
 whose press attributed to Id-
 raeli influence the fact that
 the President will not visit
 any Near Eastern Arab states--
 or from special fears--illus-
 trated by Chiang Kai-shek's
 praise for the Asian trip but
 condemnation of the exchange of
 visits between the President
 and Khrushchev as a "serious
 blow" to freedom-loving people.
 Seoul has lamented that the
 President's trip does not in-
 clude any stanchly anti-Commu-
 nist country such as  South
 Korea, Nationalist China, or
 South Vietnam.
 The Asian neutralist cho-
 rus has echoed Nehru's charac-
 terization of the President as
 "a messenger of peace in the
 world."   In general, anti-Amer-
 ican left-wing organs, includ-
 ing that of the Communist party
 of India, profess to hope for
 some good from the trip.   The
 hard-line Iraqi Communists,
 however, persist in seeing a
 pernicious American design to
 draw Turkey, Greece, Spain,
 Italy, Tunisia, Morocco, Yugo-
 slavia, and the UAR into  a
 Mediterranean pact as an adjunct
 to NATO.
 A theme emphasized in
 Southeast Asia and the Far East
 is that the President's trip
 may mark a historic turning
 point in Asian-American rela-
 tions, especially since, it
 is claimed, he comes at a time
 when Asians are beginning to
 change their views about the
 United States.  The Japanese
 particularly urge that the Pres-
 ident "listen rather  than
 preach" to the Asian and Af-
 rican peoples.
 Western Europe
 Unofficial opinion in West-
 ern Europe considers the Presi-
 dent's trip a measure of grow-
 ing American interest in under"
 developed areas, a  laudable
 move to carry outside Western
 Europe the message of the Amer-
 ican desire for peace, and above
 all an effective Western anti-
 dote to Khrushchev's personal
 diplomacy.
 The press in Italy reacted
 enthusiastically and favorably
 to the President's visit.  The
 pro-fascist Borghese, however,
 compared the trip to that of
 "a murderer who returns to the
 scene of his crime."  The Com-
 munist press, in an about-face,
 reported that "the people" feel
 a new dawn of peace possible.
 Latin America
 Sparse initial Latin Ameri-
 can reaction has shown special
 interest in the scheduled stop
 in Spain.   In mid-November the
 Venezuelan  foreign  minister
 privately stated that the Pres-
 ident's visit to Spain was an
 error in Latin American eyes,
 and predicted an adverse re-
 action throughout. the area.
 Revolucion, considered the Cas-
 tro reg me's mouthpiece, has
 attacked the scheduled call on
 Franco and in a front-page edi-
 torial on 4 December criticized
 the entire trip as a "false
 gesture of friendshi ."                25X1

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 10 December .1959
 The divergence between Mos-
 cow and Peiping in treating the
 President's trip is a further
 reflection of the policy differ-
 ences apparently straining re-
 lations between the two regimes.
 Khrushchev's last three major
 speeches have contained clear
 evidence of his concern over
 Peiping's challenge to Soviet
 ideological primacy and hegem-
 ony in the Communist world.  His
 thinly veiled criticism of Chi-
 nese policies reflects his de-
 termination to restore bloc dis-
 cipline and unity behind Mos-
 cow's lead.
 Soviet dissatisfaction with
 Peiping now is being more openly
 expressed in the Soviet Union.
 Ion 2 December a
 speaker at a public lecture at
 China's reservations about
 Khrushchev's foreign policy line
 and its obvious resentment of
 the Soviet attitude toward Chi-
 nesedomestic programs in the
 past year are currently expressed
 in Peiping's failure to show en-
 thusiasm for Khrushchev's policy
 toward the United States.  They,
 are also shown in its failure to
 endorse Khrushchev's gestures
 toward France concerning an Al-
 gerian settlement.  The Chinese
 probably view his reluctance to
 support them on the Sino-Indian
 border dispute as a violation
 of bloc solidarity. They have
 not joined in bloc praise for
 Khrushchev's ability as a the-
 orist and, by contrast, profess
 to see Mao as the "most outstand-
 ing contemporary"  revolutionist,
 statesman, and theoretician, who
 has "enriched" Communist theory.
 25X1
 Moscow University touched on dif-
 ficulties in relations between
 the USSR and China.   Specific
 mention was made of the Chinese
 action on the Indian border and
 the "cold and incorrect" recep-
 tion given Khrushchev on his re-
 cent visit to China.
 This is the most candid ref-
 erence to date to Khrushchev's
 dissatisfaction with the present
 course of Chinese internal and
 external policies.   Communist
 readers could not have failed to
 see a reference to the Chinese
 in Khrushchev's sharp criticism
 in his recent speeches of unnamed
 leaders for "conceit," "adventur-
 ist policies'of neither peace
 nor war," and lack of "proletar-
 ian internationalism."
 Ambassador Thompson believes
 the Chinese will probably ex-
 ploit any suitable opportunity
 to encourage opposition to Khru.
 shchev both in the Soviet Union
 and within the Communist bloc.
 They would probably prefer to
 see Khrushchev replaced, but pre-
 sumably recognize that his posi-
 tion in the Soviet party is too
 strong to make secret appeals to
 other Soviet leaders a fruitful
 approach.  They will try, how-
 ever, to influence his policies
 and convince other bloc leaders
 of  the validity  of their views.

 10 December-1959
 Iraq
 Despite the official fes-
 tive atmosphere throughout Iraq
 on the occasion of Prime Minis-
 ter Qasim's departure from the
 hospital last week, tension
 still seems to be growing. The
 most immediate cause is reaction
 to a six-hour  conference in
 which Qasim castigated Iraqi
 nationalist elements and ap-
 peared to lean heavily toward
 the Communists. He contradicted
 his previous charges that "an-
 archists"--his euphemism for
 Communists--had inspired last
 July's Kirkuk atrocities; in-
 stead he blamed the anti-Com-
 munist Baath party and the UAR.
 Qasim even lashed out at
 an anti-Communist student group
 which lost the recent students'
 association elections, alleging
 that this group was attempting
 to "destroy the republic." He
 accused Iraq's leading Shia Mos-
 lem divine, a strong anti-Commu-
 nist, of working for "imperial-
 ism and dissension."
 Qasim's statements will em-
 bitter anti-Communist elements
 and may embolden them to take
 precipitous attempts to over-
 throw him.  His attack on the
 religious leader is likely to
 offend the country's more than
 3,000,000 Shias, who constitute
 about 60 percent of Iraq's Arab
 population.   Criticism in army
 ranks, already outspoken in pri-
 vate, will almost certainly in-
 crease.
 In contrast to the general
 reaction to Qasim's speech, For-
 eign Minister Jawwad told the
 American ambassador on 7 Decem-
 ber that the  prime  minister
 showed "true neutrality" between
 right and left, striking "impar-
 tially between both extremes."
 Qasim in fact has done little or
 nothing to rally support from
 the middle group, has probably
 alienated the extreme right,
 and has failed to gain the real
 confidence of the left.
 Despite the uneasiness pre-
 vailing throughout the country,
 the curfew imposed on the day of
 the assassination attempt against
 Qasim has been lifted for all
 practical purposes.
 Iraqi-Iranian relations
 may deteriorate further as the
 result of Qasim's declaration
 that Iraq will seek the return
 of a five-mile strip of the
 Shatt al-Arab River, allegedly
 ceded  under  pressure  to Iran
 in  1937.   Diplomatic  efforts
 to  resolve   the dispute had beep
 under way for.some time, but
 Qa.sim's statement undercuts them.
 In addition to its contin-
 uing concern over Iraq, the UAR
 has become disturbed about Is-
 raeli intentions to divert large
 quantities of water from the
 Jordan River in the absence of
 an Arab-Israeli agreement on
 unified development of the Jor-
 dan Valley.   In an effort to
 thwart such plans, Cairo has
 requested an emergency session
 of the Arab League Council and
 reportedly will ask that body
 to approve construction of a
 dam in Syria to prevent water
 originating there from flowing
 into Israel and becoming part
 of the Jordan River. According
 to press reports, this move
 would be preceded by an Arab
 complaint to the UN Security
 Council against the Israeli
 project.
 In view of the fact that
 some 77 percent of the Jordan
 waters originates in the three
 Arab countries bordering on Is-
 rael, an Arab diversion scheme
 might be feasible even if

 streams merge in Israel       .to
 form the Jordan.  The Baniyas
 starts in Syria and the Hasbani
 in Lebanon; only the Dan  is
 exclusively an Israeli stream.
 An Israeli officer has opined
 that Israel's water supply
 could be reduced by 25 percent
 by this plan.
 Jordan and Lebanon are
 said to favor the UAR project,
 but intra-Arab disagreements on
 details of the plan,  as well as
 technical problems, may prove
 obstacles to its realization.
 Jordan itself is interested in
 downstream utilization of the
 waters and is going ahead with
 its East Ghor irrigation canal
 project which will utilize wa-
 ter from the Yarmuk River, the
 Jordan River's only major
 tributary.
 What has aroused the Arabs
 is an eight- to ten-year Israeli
 project which the Israelis say
 is compatible with and could
 be integrated into an-eventual
 agreement for Jordan Valley de-
 velopment such as the Johnston
 Plan.   "Stage One" of the Is-
 raeli scheme,  now in progress
 and scheduled for completion
 within five years, would enable
 Israel to pump water out of
 Lake Tiberias, which is fed by
 the Jordan, and convey it across
 the  Galilean  hills to Israel's
 coastal plain. Beyond that, an
 eventual diversion of the Jor
 dan's waters above Tiberias is
 envisioned for irrigation of
 the Negev Desert in southern
 Israel.   There is no real in-
 dication yet that the Arabs
 contemplate any military action
 to block t'le Israeli scheme.
 Prime Minister Ben-Gurion
 and his Mar ii party, which made
 impressive gains in the November
 Knesset elections, are continu-
 ing their negotiations aimed at
 forming a governing coalition.
 Following the election, Ben-
 Gurion indicated he would favor
 partnership with the right-wing
 General Zionists, who, along
 with Mapai, favor election re-
 form.   As of early December,
 however, the General Zionists

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The attitude of the General
 Zionists diminishes the likeli-
 hood that a right-of-center co-
 alition can be formed and has
 forced Ben-Gurion to turn-reluc-
 tantly toward the left-wing
 socialist parties, Achdut Haa-
 voda and Mapam, which were par-
 ticipants in the previous gov-
 ernment but which he considers
 intractable. Both these parties
 now may raise their price for
 an agreement, particularly on
 the issue of collective cabinet
 responsibility.  The negotia-
 tions could be prolonged.   It
 took 11 weeks to organize a
 government after the 1955 elec-
 tions.
 Iran and the USSR continue
 their diplomatic exchanges aimed
 at finding a formula which would
 offer Moscow written assurances
 pertaining to foreign bases in
 Iran and lead to cessation of
 the Soviet-sponsored propaganda
 campaign, against the Iranian
 Government.   Soviet Ambassador

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 NUCLEAR TEST CESSATION TALKS
 Soviet representatives at
 the Geneva talks are seeking
 to maintain pressure for an
 early settlement of outstand-
 ing issues.   Soviet delegate
 Tsarapkin told reporters in
 Geneva, following the 8 Decem-
 ber session of the political
 conference,. that the United
 States and Britain are "drag-
 ging their feet" in the con-
 current technical talks on the
 detection of underground tests.
 He complained that the experts
 were "still" discussing the
 new American data and had not
 reached the "important matter"
 of the circumstances which
 should be prerequisite to send-
 ing out an inspection team to
 investigate a suspected nuclear
 explosion.
 In a private discussion
 with American delegate Wadsworth
 on 1 December, Tsarapkin
 stressed the need for "mutual
 concessions."  He added that
 the USSR was "anxious" to con-
 clude a treaty even if disagree-
 ment at the technical talks
 should force "temporary abandon-
 ment of the drive toward a com-
 prehensive treaty."
 Tsarapkin has previously
 hinted privately that the USSR
 might relax its insistence on
 a permanent and unconditional
 cessation of all tests.   He in-
 dicated interest in a phased
 approach which would provide
 for a permanent ban on atmos-
 pheric, high-altitude, and
 underwater tests and a temporary
 prohibition on underground
 tests, pending development of
 a trustworthy control system.
 He emphasized, however, that
 the "crux of the matter" is
 the obligation for a full ces-
 sation of all tests at the out-
 set, regardless of the temporary
 nature , of  the  underground
 ban.
 The Soviet delegate on-8
 December requested the Western
 delegations to urge their tech-
 nical working groups to speed
 up the discussions in order to
 reach agreement on the criteria
 for initiating on-site inspec-
 tion and conclude the group's
 report by 11 December.
 The Soviet experts at the
 technical talks have repeatedly
 requested that the Western dele-
 gation accompany with specific
 treaty language the introduction
 of any new data..  These tactics
 are apparently intended to
 probe the extent of revision
 of the 1958 experts' report
 the Western delegations intend
 to insist on in light of their
 new data.  Moscow may be willing
 to accept minor adjustments
 in the 1958 conclusions and
 recommendations which would not
 alter the basic conclusion
 that a control system over the
 cessation..,.of all types of test-
 ing is technically feasible.
 Soviet chief technical ex-
 pert Fedorov admitted privately
 on 6 December that the 1958 re-
 port was,not the "last word" or
 "completely accurate," but he
 asserted that it was good enough
 !!for a start."  He acknowledged
 for the first time the possibil-
 ity..-of "degradation" as well as
 improvements in the system rec-
 ommended in 1958.   He repeated,
 however, the Soviet view that
 the system could be improved
 rapidly after being put into
 operation.
 On 8 December, Fedorov
 criticized American draft con-
 clusions based on new data as
 merely restating the original

 Soviet arguments made since the

 the American proposals but al-
 leged that they were too de-

 On instructions from Prime
 Minister Macmillan, Minister of
 State Ormsby-Gore has gone to
 Geneva, apparently to urge the
 United States to avoid taking a
 position in the technical talks
 which could lead to a breakdown
 in the negotiations.   Stressing
 that Britain's chief delegate
 in the technical discussions was
 "pessimistic" over the outcome
 of the talks, Ormsby-Gore be-
 lieves that in the event the ne-
 gotiations collapse without a
 treaty or if one power resumed
 testing, a special session of
 the General Assembly would be
 convoked to consider the situa-
 tion.   He also expressed his be-
 lief that the political risk of
 refusing to agree on a treaty
 because of technical difficul-
 ties in detecting underground
 explosions had increased "100
 percent since last year."

 be grooming him rather than First

 Kadar made a number of per-

 conducted over the past three
 years.     Kallai also demonstrated
 considerable sensitivity to the
 idea that an international de-
 tente means ideological or po-
 litical compromise.
 Some recent personnel chag-
 es--both at the congress and
 preceding it--suggest a definite
 effort by Kadar to tighten con-
 trol of the agitprop complex.
 Gyorgy Marosan, who was elevated
 to the post of party second
 secretary one month ago, may
 have been given certain respon-
 sibilities to strengthen agit-
 prop work.
 The fact that the stature
 of front-line Stalinists was
 not reduced suggests that Kadar
 believes that the best approach
 is to utilize all elements of
 the still weak party organiza-
 tion without undermining its
 strength by purges, while at the
 same time emphasizing the need
 for party discipline and unity.
 EAST GERMAN REGIME TROUBLED BY FOOD SHORTAGES
 A number of East German
 party and government officials
 are being made scapegoats for
 the current shortages of meat
 and dairy products.   Party
 First Secretary Ulbricht may
 extend the shake-up as a means
 of getting rid of officials
 who have questioned his agricul-
 tural policies.
 Minister of Agriculture
 Hans Reichelt has been sharply
 attacked in the party daily
 Neues Deutschland for tolerating
 "opportunist and revisionist"
 views among officials in his
 ministry.   Politburo member
 Erich  Mueckenberger,  reportedly
 already under fire, may be cen-
 sured at the forthcoming sev-
 enth SED plenum and may even be
 deprived of his responsibility
 for agricultural affairs.
 A shake-up at the local
 level is already in progress
 and will probably spread.   U1-
 bricht recently castigated Ros-
 tock District officials for
 failing to take steps to secure
 fodder supplies--notably their
 refusal to enlarge the acreage
 planted in corn.
 The general failure of the
 year's agricultural plan--due
 in large part to a serious
 drought--has caused shortages
 of vegetables, fruit, meat, and
 especially dairy products.   Re-
 strictions on the sale of butter
 have become necessary, since the
 regime apparently is resolved
 not to import it from the West.
 Throughout the country, dairy
 products have become an active
 commodity in the black market,
 smuggling of butter to Berlin
 continues,  and East Berlin
 housewives are crossing the
 border to purchase more expen-
 sive West Berlin butter.
 Obviously reluctant to re-
 institute rationing only 18
 months after its abolition= the
 regime is appealing to the peo-
 ple for "more discipline when
 the shortages become acute in
 the winter months" and has
 adopted several measures to en-
 sure the best possible distribu-
 tion without resort to rationing

 PEIPING RELEASES WAR CRIMINALS
 Peiping's release of 33
 "war criminals"--announced on
 4 December in accordance with
 a directive promulgated by
 Chairman Liu Shao-chi on 17
 September--appears to be part
 of the regime's continuing ef-
 fort to undermine the stabil-
 ity of the Taiwan government
 by holding out the prospect of
 pardon for Kuomintang officials.
 Thirty of those pardoned
 are former Kuomintang officials
 captured during the Communist
 seizure of the mainland, one
 is an official of the Japanese-
 sponsored  Inner  Mongolia
 autonomous government, and two
 are former Manchukuo govern-
 ment leaders, including Henry
 Pu Yi--the last  Emperor  of
 China and Japanese puppet
 Emperor in Manchuria. All are
 said to have recanted their
 crimes and to have  "turned
 over a new Ieaf," following
 ten years of labor and ideo-
 logical education:
 The Chinese Communist
 leaders will exploit these
 pardons in their long-term
 effort to convince Nationalist
 officials that Peiping will be
 "lenient" with "compatriots"
 who choose to join the Commu-
 nist cause.  On 5 December,
 Peiping beamed a special broad-
 cast to Taiwan in Mandarin di-
 recting the attention of "Kuo-
 mintang military and govern-
 ment personnel" to the rally
 held for the release.  An ear-
 lier broadcast had reiterated
 the offer made by Premier Chou
 En-lai for cooperation between
 the Communist party and the
 Kuomintang for unification of
 the "fatherland" and had stated,
 "If you are patriotic Chinese,
 I hope you will return to the
 mainland and see the situation
 for yourselves."
 In addition to pardoning
 war criminals, Peiping has re-
 stored to good standing 142
 persons branded as "rightists"
 during the 1957-58 rectifica-
 tion campaign.   This group
 comprises mainly second-level
 puppet party leaders and intel-
 lectuals and does not include
 the most prominent "rightists,"
 some of whom had already been
 partially rehabilitated.   A
 total of 12,032 have been pardoned
 since issuance of the September
 amnesty decree, according to a
 Peiping announcement.
 Peiping's decision to grant
 amnesties at this time is prob-
 ably intended to demonstrate
 the country's stability and
 maturity following ten years
 of Communist rule.  Pardoning

 of the "rightists" seems de-

 habilitation at a time when
 critics-of the regime both
 within and outside the party
 are being urged to re-examine
 their positions and whole-
 heartedly support the party
 center and its programs.
 There has been no indica-
 tion that amnesty will be granted
 to the five Americans being held
 in Chinese prisons, whom Peiping
 apparently considers valuable
 hostages.  Their disposition
 would seem to be a separate is-   25X1

 on some improvement in Sino-

 The Indonesian Government,
 determined to carry out its ban
 on rural alien retailers despite
 strong Chinese Communist objec-

 line of 1 January for implemen-
 tation of the decree.  The Indo-
 nesian Army has admitted man-
 handling some Chinese and mak-
 ing numerous arrests in the
 course of resettlement and has
 acknowledged that city homes
 provided for evacuated Chinese
 are not "palaces."
 Recurrent instances of mal-
 tre:ataeutL could set an example
 for the Indonesian populace,
 which generally dislikes the
 Chinese, to carry out vigilante
 actions.  The West Java army
 commander, apparently concerned
 over local incidents, publicly
 instructed his officers in late
 November to exercise tact and
 patience in handling the reset-

 that the embassy, in addition,
 brands as traitors those Chinese
 who have complied with the evac-
 uation order and has threatened
 retaliation against their fami-
 lies in China.  Most  of  this
 activity has occurred in West

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 CEYLON
 Governor General Goonetil-
 leke's dissolution of Ceylon's
 Parliament on 4December and
 his call for new national elec-
 tions on 19 March have ended for
 the time being the uncertainty
 over day-to-day political de-
 velopments.  Prime Minister
 Dahanayake will head an interim
 government. On 8 December
 Goonetilleke, at Dahanayake's
 request, dismissed six of the
 prime minister's most vocifer-
 ous critics, including five
 cabinet ministers, and rein-
 stated former Finance Minister
 de Zoysa, who was recently
 forced to resign because of his
 alleged involvement in the Han-
 daranaike= assassination.   Pub-
 lic preoccupation with campaign
 activities may stimulate some
 unrest and will probably lead
 the government to ignore for
 several more months the island's
 pressing economic problems.
 The abrupt dissolution pre-
 sumably was prompted by Dahana-
 yake's realization that, as the
 government's collapse was in-
 evitable, his own political
 status would suffer less should
 he resign voluntarily rather
 than remain affiliated with the
 discredited ruling party and
 govern without a popular man-
 date.   In a broadcast on 5 De-
 cember, Dahanayake implied that
 the action was intended to
 serve national interests and
 took credit for having paved
 the way for peaceable elections.
 Enumerating his accomplishments,
 Dahanayake included achievements
 which had been realized before
 he took office but for which the
 public may henceforth consider
 him partly responsible.
 No single party seems like-
 ly to win a majority in the new
 Parliament--the membership of
 which will increase from 101 to
 151.  The leading contenders
 will be the moderate United Na-
 tional party (UNP), the ruling
 party prior to the 1956 elec-
 tions, and the Trotskyite Lanka
 Sama Samaj party (LSSP), the
 leading opposition group since
 the elections.  The UNP appears
 confident of winning substan-
 tial support and is credited.
 locally with having made a come-
 back since its overwhelming de-
 feat in 1956.
 However, the party still
 has to prove its willingness to
 replace unpopular "old guard"
 elements and demonstrate its
 ability to offer a "progressive"
 program to a public still some-
 what disenchanted with the UNP
 and concerned chiefly with eco-
 nomic advancement.   The party
 will also have to reckon with
 the LSSP's extensive urban
 labor following and the prestige
 of LSSP leader N. M. Perera,
 one of the most highly regarded
 politicians in Ceylon.
 The ruling Sri Lanka Free-
 dom party (SLFP) is unlikely to
 continue as a significant politi-
 cal group.  Many members probably
 will either attempt to join the
 UNP or seek re-election as inde-
 pendents.  Others may join or
 follow the example of Dahanayake,
 who has resigned from the SLFP
 and formed a new conservative
 party.  The election strategy of
 all parties will become more ap-
 parent following the nomination
 of candidates on i January.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 A government crisis in Laos
 has been at least temporarily
 averted by the recent decision
 of the cabinet to schedule gen-
 eral elections tentatively for
 April 1960.   Until that time,
 the deputies of the present Na-
 tional Assembly will stay in
 office, although the assembly
 as a whole will apparently not
 function after 25 December, the
 date its mandate will expire
 under the constitution.   The
 possibility that the elections
 might be further postponed is
 left open by the stipulation in
 Premier Phoui's communiqud an-
 nouncing the cabinet decision
 that they will take place "ex-
 cept under circumstances beyond
 the government's control."
 In a deadlock of some weeks
 standing, the conservative ele-
 ments in the government, led
 by Phoui, had urged that the
 assembly's mandate be extended
 for one year and that elections
 be held in December 1960.   The
 reformist Committee for Defense
 of National Interests (CDNI),
 which is represented in the cab-
 inet but not in the assembly,
 had argued for terminating the
 assembly's mandate on schedule
 and for earlier elections.
 While the compromise reached on
 these issues is based on some-
 what tenuous legal grounds, its
 very imprecision will enable
 each side to save face by claim-
 ing it represents substantial
 concessions to its position.
 Phoui now plans to revamp
 his cabinet and seek a fresh
 vote of confidence in a special
 National Assembly session prior
 to the expiration of its man-
 date on 25 December.   He may
 run into opposition on the pro-
 posed assembly session, however,
 in view of the known distaste
 for the assembly's membership
 harbored by the CDNI and the
 King.   Another possible source
 of trouble is his threat to de-
 mote Foreign Minister Khamphan
 Panya, a CDNI leader, to a less-
 er cabinet position.   The CDNI
 is already annoyed over remarks
 Phoui made to the press follow-
 ing the compromise settlement
 accusing the CDNI of dictatorial
 aims.   These developments could
 upset the precarious compromise
 reached on the assembly's tenure
 and the timing of new elections.
 The military situation con-
 tinues generally calm, with only
 minor scattered incidents re-
 ported.
 Meanwhile, the executive
 secretary of the UN Economic
 Commission for Asia and the Far
 East (ECAFE)--U Nyun of Burma--
 reports that the economic study
 on Laos now is being drafted by
 Hammarskjold's personal repre-
 sentative, Sakari Tuomioja of
 Finland, with the assistance
 of ECAFE and other UN officers.
 The report will be of an interim
 nature with a more intensive
 survey to be conducted by the
 group scheduled to succeed Tuo-
 mioja's.
 U Nyun believes that Laos'
 most pressing need is an ele-
 mentary transportation system.
 He said that the immediate ob-
 jective would probably be to
 have the various UN specialized
 agencies undertake emergency
 assistance for Laos.   He does
 not think there is any danger
 of Communist aid to Laos.
 U Nyun added that the mere
 absence of treaty arrangements
 with the West did not consti-
 tute as full a measure of neu-
 trality as Hammarskjold had in
 mind.   He implied that the sec-
 retary general would like to see
 a neutral Laos along the lines
 of Cambodia.

 10 December 1959
 French President de Gaulle
 and leaders of the Mali Federa-
 tion--composed of the autono-
 mous French Community states
 of Senegal and Soudan--appear
 to have agreed in principle
 during talks in late November
 that by June 1960 Mali should
 receive sovereign powers and
 enter into special cooperation
 agreements with France.   Seri-
 ous discord exists, however, as
 to when these ties are to be-
 come effective,and differences
 seem likely to develop over
 substantive aspects as well.
 According to Mali Assembly
 President Senghor--who partici-
 pated in the talks along with
 Mali President Keita and Vice
 President Dia, respectively the
 premiers of Soudan and Senegal
 --De Gaulle readily accepted
 Mali's plan to achieve independ-
 ence through a negotiated
 transfer of "common" powers now
 actually wielded by Paris.  He
 insisted, however, that Mali's
 continued membership in the
 French-subsidized Community de-
 pended on the cooperation
 agreements.being worked out in
 detail beforehand and coming
 into force on the date of in-
 dependence.
 These agreements would cre-
 ate special contractual rela-
 tionships between France and
 Mali in such fields as defense,
 foreign affairs, economic aid,
 and education.  De Gaulle appar-
 ently indicated that the only
 alternative route to independ-
 ence open to Mali would be to
 invoke the constitution's ref-
 erendum procedure, a step which
 would put Mali completely out-
 side the Community and almost
 certainly mean a cessation of
 French economic aid.
 Under the new relationship,
 Paris hopes to ensure extensive
 coordination by Mali of its for-
 eign, defense, economic, and
 cultural policies.  Mali's
 leaders, on the other hand, can
 be expected to resist French at-
 tempts to limit Mali's freedom
 of action following independence.
 They are already under consider-
 able pressure from more militant
 domestic elements who wish to
 emulate Guinea's complete break-
 away from the French sphere.

 forces in Soudan, where such
 elements are particularly strong

 BRITAIN'S RELATIONS WITH WESTERN EUROPE
 The first round in imple-
 menting the Macmillan govern-
 ment's major objective of im-
 proving relations with Western
 Europe has helped the cross-
 channel atmosphere but produced
 few specific proposals.
 In the past month the
 British have talked at the head-
 of-government or foreign-minis-
 ter level with all Common Mar-
 ket (EEC) countries except
 Luxembourg in a determined
 attempt to allay some European
 apprehensions on certain issues.
 The British leaders have re-
 peatedly denounced disengage-
 ment as such--while reiterating
 support of a "pilot" plan for
 arms limitation and inspection
 in Europe that would not dis-
 criminate against West Germany
 --and proclaimed that Britain
 considers itself "part of Eu-
 rope."
 London's principal sug-
 gestion has been to use the
 Western European Union  (WEU)--
 the one body composed of the
 six EEC countries plus Britain
 --for political consultations.
 The further extension of EEC
 solidarity by means of the re=
 cently agreed quarterly foreign
 ministers' consultations dis-
 turbs London.   Whenever these
 consultations venture beyond
 economic matters, the British
 want to bring in WEU, until
 now a near-dormant institution
 concerned with controlling
 limitations on Bonn's rearmament.
 European reaction appears cool,
 however, and a high British
 Foreign Office official antici-
 pates that little will come of
 the proposal.
 Otherwise, Britain's new
 drive is shown in its cultiva-
 tion of France, especially on
 issues affecting Africa.   Lon-
 don lobbied for the French on
 the Saharan nuclear test resolu-
 tion in the UN and is trying to
 help them on the Algerian is-
 sue.   In deference to French
 sensibilities, Britain has
 ended consultation with the
 United States on supplying
 arms to Tunisia.   Regarding
 Bonn, London hopes to build
 on growing bilateral   trade
 ties and on joint arms produc-
 tion arrangements, as agreed
 last week by Defense Ministers
 Watkinson and Strauss.

 Acknowledged differences
 remain on such major issues as

 retain its special ties with

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY S IUA'Y
 10 December 1959
 THE NATO MEETINGS
 East-West relations in the
 light of summit preparations
 will be the main concern of the
 annual meeting of the NATO
 ministerial council on 15-17
 December.  Other major topics
 include NATO economic coopera-
 tion and the status of the
 military effort.  The council
 is scheduled to reconvene on
 22 December to hear a report
 on the "Western summit" four-
 power talks.
 For consideration of the
 situation that would prevail in
 a period of international de-
 tente, Secretary General Spaak
 has suggested focusing atten-
 tion on how the East and West
 interpret the meaning of "peace-
 ful coexistence" and what im-'
 pact this would have in the
 field of NATO political con-
 sultation and defense.
 Discussion of economic
 problems will be directed to-
 ward their political aspects.
 Britain, Canada, and West Ger-
 many favor a general approach
 without going exhaustively into
 intra-European questions--main-
 ly the rival Common Market and
 Outer Seven groupings--and the
 question of underdeveloped
 areas, which the :Belgians would
 like to consider.  The Greeks,
 perhaps jointly with the Turks,
 may push their claim that the
 richer allies should help the
 poorer ones on economic matters.
 The present status of the
 NATO military effort, charac-
 terized by a persistent gap be-
 tween military requirements and
 CONTINUING DIFFICULTIES
 Panamanian disappointment
 with the results of recent con-
 versations with US officials
 probably presages a continued
 period of difficulty in US-
 Panamanian relations.   Foreign
 Minister Moreno told the US
 ambassador on 4 December that
 their realization, has led the
 military authorities to declare
 that the current and prospective
 defense posture of the alliance
 gives cause for "grave concern"
 over NATO's continued deteriora-
 tion in relation to Soviet
 strength.  Under present cir-
 cumstances, they hold it un-
 likely that the NATO strategic
 concept of forward defense
 could be fully implemented.
 Differing opinions on the
 effect of the so-called East-
 West thaw on the Soviet threat
 can be expected to provoke more
 than routine consideration of
 the West's proper defense pos-
 ture and procedures for achiev-
 ing it.   Special military  .
 items for discussion are the
 nuclear capability of NATO
 shield forces and progress in
 air defense, which would prob-
 ably bring up the problem of
 De Gaulle's obstructive tac-
 tics.  Norway may receive at-
 tention for its proposal to
 study whether the procedure
 for reviewing the military pro-
 gram should be changed.
 IN US-PANAMANIAN RELATIONS
 the Panamanian Government would
 soon publish a statement declar-
 ing that, in spite of recent
 discussions, the United States
 has made no substantial conces-
 sions regarding the Canal Zone,
 and "no progress whatsoever"
 has been made in the settlement

 differences.
 The ambassador also was
 told that the Panamanian Govern-
 ment felt obliged to inform its
 citizens, whose hopes of great-
 er canal benefits have been
 raised by recent events, that
 the administration regarded the
 latest US offers of economic
 concessions to Panama as being
 too vague and "entirely unsatis-
 factory."  Public hostility to-
 ward the United States has ap-
 peared somewhat reduced since
 the 20-24 November discussions
 between Panamanian officials
 and Deputy Under Secretary of
 State Merchant, but publication
 at this time of a strongly
 worded official statement criti-
 cizing the recent negotiations
 would increase the likelihood
 of new anti-American outbursts.
 Panamanian extremists are
 planning further anti-US dis-
 turbances.  Nationalistic stu-
 dent elements are reported or-
 ganizing a "grandiose manifesta-
 tion" for 12 December, in order
 to celebrate the anniversary of
 the Panamanian rejection of an
 agreement on US military bases
 in 1947.  First Vice President
 Temistocles Diaz, a possible
 opposition candidate for presi-
 dent in next May's presidential
 election, is reported backing
 plans for the 12 December demon-
 stration.
 BRAZIL, PRESSES ' OPPRAfl N' PAN',AMERICA't
 Brazil is intensifying its
 diplomatic campaign to build
 support for "Operation Pan-Amer-
 ica" (OPA), President Kubi-
 tschek's proposal for a "dynam-
 ic" inter-American effort to
 speed economic development.
 Kubitschek considers such an ef-
 fort essential to combat in-
 creasing Communist agitation as
 well as to meet the needs of the
 expanding population.   OPA will
 continue as a major Brazilian
 policy and will be pushed at
 the 11th Inter-American Confer-
 ence scheduled for 1 February
 in Quito.
 Kubitschek first suggested
 the idea in a letter to Presi-
 dent Eisenhower on 28 May 1958,
 following the attacks on Vice
 President Nixon in  Peru  and
 Venezuela.   He called for a
 "plan to reassess hemispheric
 policy in order to place Latin
 America in a more effective role
 in the defense of the West,"
 particularly by economic devel-
 opment.
 Kubitschek's suggestion re-
 sulted in several meetings,  in-
 cluding that of the American
 foreign ministers in September
 1958 and two meetings,6f the Com-

 main results, besides an exchange

 council for economic develop-

 permanent retention of the

 criticism of the OAS, which
 Brazil would like to bypass in
 matters concerning OPA.
 Within Brazil, OPA has been
 of political value to Kubitschek.

 his most popular policy moves.
 Some see in OPA, along with Bra-

 Fraud and other methods of
 influencing the vote were em-

 in rural Indian areas, on be-
 half of pro-Ydigoras candidates
 and were probably decisive in
 a number of constituencies.
 Leftist parties showed consid-

 President Castillo Armas, had
 its chances of a comeback 'now

 ras, by a series of maneuvers
 and bribes to MDN officials
 shortly before election day,
 caused the party to split into
 mutually hostile factions and
 again demonstrated his skill as
 a political manipulator.  At
 the same time, the failure of
 leftist parties to sweep the
 elections has eliminated the
 rightists' main issue against
 the President.
 Leftists are still strong
 among the Guatemalan voters,
 but Ydigoras' efforts to weaken
 the large Revolutionary party
 by fostering rival leftist splin-
 ter parties, have evidently had
 some success.   Last July the PR
 received 84 percent of the total
 leftist vote in the Guatemala
 City municipal election.  On 6
 December, with the leftists
 split four ways, the PR was
 supported by only 64 percent of
 these voters.   The Communist-
 front Party of Revolutionary
 Unification won the bulk of the
 votes lost by the anti-Communist
 PR.
 Ydigoras' denunciation on 5
 December to the Council of the
 Organization of American States
 of an alleged Communist-Cuban

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 COMMUNIST CHINA'S RELATIONS WITH THE NON-COMMUNIST WORLD
 In contrast to Moscow's
 peace initiatives, Peiping has
 tended toward crude displays
 of strength in its relations
 with free world countries. The
 Chinese leaders probably be-
 lieve that the Kremlin's more
 moderate approach, if pursued
 by the weaker Peiping regime,
 would encourage rather than
 abate US opposition to Chinese
 Communist aspirations in the
 Far East, e.g., the "liberation"
 of Taiwan.   In addition, the
 Chinese value a "struggle" at-
 mosphere as essential to the
 development of their economy
 to the levels of the more in-
 dustrialized countries. "Face
 to face with the American ag-
 gressor," as Peiping puts it,
 "the Chinese people are forced
 to intensify their work and
 build economically backward
 China into an advanced, indus-
 trialized, and socialist pow-
 The preference of the
 Chinese for hard       taCtlCs
 is reinforced by the knowledge
 that their conciliatory ap-
 proach in the years immediately
 following the 1955 Bandung con-
 ference did not particularly
 succeed in enlarging their in-
 fluence in Asia.
 On the contrary, they see
 a "rightist" trend in the non-
 Communist countries of Asia,
 following the rise to power of
 military leaders.   Peiping be-
 lieves its efforts should be
 directed toward projecting the
 image of a strong, assertive
 power that is still receptive
 to "peaceful" solutions but is
 ready to back up its claims by
 diplomatic, economic, or mil-
 itary pressures.
 The inclination to tougher
 tactics is illustrated in re-
 cent dealings with Djakarta.
 During his trip to Peiping last
 October,  Indonesia's Foreign
 Minister Subandrio found Pre-
 mier Chou En-lai--who waved a
 threatening finger at him--a
 "changed man" from the Chou of
 1955.   Subandrio was awakened
 in the middle of the night for
 the only interview granted him
 by Mao Tse-tung and was treated
 like a"schoolboy" by the Chinese
 leader.   Mao made clear Peiping's
 displeasure over the discrimina-
 tory legislation against Over-
 seas Chinese in Indonesia.
 It is improbable that Pei-
 ping misjudged the resentment
 its tactics engendered, but
 Indonesian good will in this
 case was deemed clearly subordi-
 nate to the preservation of Com-
 munist China's repute as a pow-
 er capable of effective inter-
 cession on behalf of its nation-
 als abroad.
 Policy Toward the US
 The Chinese leaders are at
 particular pains to maintain
 the appearance of confident
 strength in their policy toward
 the United States.   They are
 vehement in their opposition to
 any "two Chinas" solution for
 Taiwan and publicly stress their
 "right" and determination to use
 "whatever means necessary" to
 seize the offshore islands and
 Taiwan.   After backing down
 from preparations to take the
 offshore islands in 1958, the
 Chinese have continued inter-
 mittent shelling in order to
 demonstrate that they retain
 the military initiative.
 China's hesitancy to en-
 gage the United States militar-
 ily at this time is evident in
 Laos.   Peiping's public role
 has been largely restricted to
 propaganda charges of illegal
 US activities in Laos and to

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 representations designed to
 convince India, Britain, and
 France of the need to reactivate
 the International Control Com-
 mission there.
 The Chinese leaders justi-
 fy their hostility to the United
 States in terms at variance
 with Khrushchev's recent state-
 ments on the possibility of
 avoiding war.  An article in
 the 5 June issue of World
 Knowledge--Peiping's journal
 on current international af-
 fairs--states that "imperial-
 ism remains imperialism for-
 ever" and that'-"as long as
 imperialism exists, the people
 of the world cannot avoid the
 threat of war."  The line is
 not an appeal for immediate
 war with the United States;
 it is an attempt to support
 the Chinese view that world
 opinion must be turned full
 blast against the United States,
 and that tension and threats to
 use force are necessary for
 Peiping's effort to reduce US
 influence in the Far East.
 More recently, politburo
 member Peng Chen stated that
 although the United States still
 refuses to give up the "policy
 of war and aggression," people
 of the world "render it more
 difficult for the United States
 to start a war."  This appears
 to be an effort to bring the
 Chinese line somewhat closer to
 Moscow's on the concept that
 war is not inevitable, while
 still expressing Peiping's res-
 ervations about American sin-
 cerity.
 Border Issues
 The Chinese attitude on
 border issues is strongly con-
 ditioned by the need to oppose
 the legality of claims which
 are heritages of "British im-
 perialism."  To mollify New
 Delhi and Rangoon, Peiping has
 resorted to the expedient of
 professing a willingness to
 negotiate but has in fact stalled
 on a settlement of frontier
 claims.
 When the Tibetan revolt
 broke out in 1959, Peiping moved
 to seal off Tibet's borders.   In
 attempting this along a vast un-
 demarcated border, clashes with
 Indian patrols moving up to the
 frontier occurred.  The harden-
 ing of New Delhi's attitude in
 the wake of the clashes in-
 creased Peiping's apprehension
 that Nehru was "drifting into
 the Western camp" and, together
 with resentment at New Delhi's
 sympathy for Tibet and at the
 asylum granted the Dalai Lama,
 contributed to the tougher Chi-
 nese political policy toward
 India.
 Peiping has indicated will-
 ingness to accept a temporary
 solution pending an over-all set-
 tlement, but it has made clear
 that such an understanding must
 not involve a unilateral Chinese
 retreat from the frontier or any
 other such imputation of Chinese
 weakness.
 In the case of Burma, ex-
 asperation with Peiping's stall-
 ing tactics led Prime Minister
 Ne Win last June to send a "take
 it or leave it" package proposal

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 "negotiate further."  The Chi-
 nese leaders are unlikely to
 agree to a settlement with the
 present government in Rangoon
 which might be interpreted as
 a "victory" for anti-Communist
 Ne Win.
 Overseas Chinese
 The growth of Communist
 China as a great power is a
 concept carefully cultivated
 by Peiping among Chinese out-
 side the country.   The Chinese
 Communist leaders view the
 great-power image as a major
 political asset in their com-
 petition with Nationalist China
 for the loyalty of "overseas
 brothers" who look at times to the
 intercession of a strong Chi-
 nese government to protect them
 against discrimination by local
 authorities.
 Despite the high value it
 places on Indonesian neutralism,
 Peiping considers its standing
 in the eyes of the Overseas
 Chinese so vital that it is try-
 ing to coerce Djakarta to mod-
 if y its ban on alien merchants
 in rural areas.   The Chinese
 Communist Embassy in Djakarta
 referred to resettlement areas
 for Chinese merchants as "con-
 centration camps," and Premier
 Chou En-lai threatened Indonesia
 with economic sanctions.   Pei-
 ping seems to be seeking an out-
 come that at the very least will
 make it clear to Overseas Chi-
 nese that their lot would have
 been worse without Chinese Com-
 munist intercession.
 Peiping's approach to the
 Middle Eastern and African coun-
 tries is conciliatory on the
 whole, although even here Chi-
 na's espousal of Communist
 viewpoints has occasionally
 stepped on the toes of Nasir
 and other nationalists.   Chi-
 nese propaganda stresses that
 the countries of this area,  like
 China, have "thrown off the im-
 perialist yoke," and it implies
 that the experience of underdevel-
 oped China is particularly rel-
 evant to their conditions.
 Peiping probably calculates
 it has a fair chance of impress-
 ing the Middle East and Africa
 with China's economic and social
 transformation and that it may
 thereby achieve considerable in-
 fluence in the area.   While en-
 couraging nationalist movements,
 the Chinese seem eager at the
 same time to promote Communist
 capabilities to take over the
 "bourgeois" revolutions, and they
 are giving support to local Com-
 munists.
 With very limited capabil-
 ities, the Chinese have chosen
 to devote their main aid effort
 to small, primitive Yemen, which
 has had little contact with
 Western technology, and where
 the Chinese program will have
 the maximum impact.   Looking to
 the future, the Chinese may re-
 gard their aid program there as
 a pilot project for similar ac-
 tivity in newly independent
 countries of Africa where gov-
 ernments are favorably disposed
 toward Peiping.
 China's public support of
 the Algerian rebels contrasts
 with Moscow's more circumspect
 position.   Peiping, which has
 no diplomatic relations with
 France, has formally recognized
 the Algerian provisional govern-
 ment, whereas the Soviet Union
 has not.   Following Khrushchev's
 31 October speech to the Supreme
 Soviet in which he hinted at sup-
 porting De Gaulle's Algerian pro-
 posal, however, Peiping has
 seemed hesitant to contradict
 flatly the Soviet line.

 which have formally recognized
 Communist China, to support
 Peiping on international is-
 sues has apparently persuaded
 the Chinese that Europe does
 not offer particularly fer-
 tile ground for their polit-
 ical activity.
 The Chinese leaders ap-
 pear to realize that diplomat-
 ic recognition by West Euro-
 pean powers such as France and
 Italy is not an immediate
 prospect, and this realiza-
 tion was probably a factor in
 Peiping's decision to offend
 the French and recognize the
 Algerian rebels.  The almost
 complete isolation of the
 British and Dutch embassies
 in Peiping reflects the bit-
 terness of the Chinese lead-
 ers, who have referred to the
 China policies of both govern-
 ments as "two-faced."
 Latin America
 The Chinese Communists
 draw a parallel between Latin
 American unrest and China's
 emergence from "foreign dom-
 ination."  There is a note of
 optimism in Chinese propaganda
 on the "mounting struggle a-
 gainst US imperialism," de-
 spite the Western orientation
 of most governments in Latin
 America and the fact that no
 government there has accorded
 Peiping formal recognition.
 As steppingstones to  full
 diplomatic  relations,  Pei-
 ping has been  pressing                  for
 governmental and nongovern-
 mental cultural and trade ex-
 changes.
 The Chinese leaders seem
 hopeful that a loose grouping
 of anti-US states will evolve
 around Cuba, and they there-
 fore  have  made  that island
 the focus for their ef-
 forts  to  increase  Commu-
 nist  China's influence in
 the area.
 Prospects
 The Chinese are probably
 under pressure from Moscow to
 moderate tactics which have im-
 paired bloc. prestige.  Moreover,
 the Indian Communists have told
 them that the Sino-Indian bor-
 der dispute has damaged the in-
 ternal position of the Indian
 party.  Peiping's tough tactics
 in Indonesia are likewise em-
 barrassing the Indonesian Commu-
 nists. The Chinese leaders are
 willing to take steps to appear
 more "reasonable" in'these two
 disputes, but the need'to avoid
 at all costs any show of weak-
 ness will continue to limit
 Peiping in the concessions it
 can offer.
 The Chinese probably do not
 intend soon to alter the pres-
 ent course of their policy to-
 ward strongly pro-Western gov-
 ernments.  The necessity of
 meeting American hostility to
 Peiping with "tough talk"
 rather than any display of
 "weakness" will continue to be
 a cardinal principle of the Chi-
 nese leaders.  The "imperialist
 aggressor" theme will also con-
 tinue to be used to spur domes-
 tic production.
 The Chinese, however, are
 not altogether unresponsive to
 Soviet wishes and want to min-
 imize public displays of differ-
 ences.  Peiping is therefore
 likely to give lip service at
 least to the possibility of a
 "thaw" in international rela-
 tions.  On 6 November the Chi-
 nese stated that they would
 "work for the complete realiza-
 tion" of Soviet peace moves and
 that they "need" peace to build
 up China's economy.  This mod-
 erate tone does not mean an end
 to the attacks on American ac-
 tivities in the Far East, how-
 ever, or any alteration of such
 basic policy positions as the
 necessity and inevitability of
 Taiwan's "liberation."

 France's ability to main-
 tain strong ties with its over-
 seas areas, particularly Algeria,
 will depend to a large extent
 on the scope of the French eco-
 nomic and social aid program.
 At his press conference on 10
 November, President de Gaulle
 recognized the aspirations of
 the underdeveloped countries
 and underscored the responsi-
 bility of the highly industri-
 alized nations to help them.
 Reproving those who fail to see
 the change taking place in such
 regions,as well as those who
 think continued association with
 underdeveloped areas is too ex-
 pensive, De Gaulle offered "to
 provide as much aid as France
 can to those people who want
 our help."
 De Gaulle's broad promise
 of aid is bound to generate ad-
 ditional requirements for French
 capital expenditures, especially
 in Algeria, where economic as-
 sistance needs are already out-
 stripping funds available under
 the Constantine Plan.   Finance

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 General for Algeria Paul Delou-
 vrier, school attendance was
 upped by 100,000 to cover a
 quarter of the school-age pop-
 ulation.   It is estimated that,
 by the end of 1959, 20,000 ur-
 ban dwellings and 160  ,iew vil-
 lages will have been completed
 and 2,500 families will have
 participated in land redistri-
 bution.   The Algerian wage
 level has risen, largely be-
 cause of the increasing number
 of workers employed in the oil
 and natural-gas industries.
 Present Capital Sources
 To finance the Algerian
 program, the 1959 French budget
 included $200,000,000 in di-
 rect grants, to be increased
 gradually to approximately
 $400,000,000 by 1963.   Largely
 to finance specific projects,
 the government has provided
 another source of capital in
 the form of loans from public
 financial institutions and
 privately subscribed bond is-
 sues.
 It is becoming increas-
 ingly clear, however, that gov-
 ernment financing is inadequate
 and that private investment,
 originally counted on to fill
 the gap between program costs
 and public expenditures, has
 not responded as much as had
 been hoped.   Except to develop
 oil, private French capital
 has been reluctant to move to
 an area so remote from markets,
 with few readily accessible
 raw materials and little skilled
 labor.   The uncertain political
 climate and the requirement
 that Algerian industry be French
 controlled have discouraged
 foreign private capital.
 Moreover, the Finance Min-
 istry has interpreted very cau-
 tiously the legislation to en-
 courage capital movement through
 large-scale government aid.
 For example, its inability to
 agree with private steel com-
 panies on the amount of gov-
 ernment subsidy needed to cover
 expected operating deficits at
 the proposed steel-producing
 complex near Bone has meant
 delay 'and_:possible cancellation
 of part of the project.
 The political need of con-
 vincing the Algerian Moslems
 that their best future lies in
 association with France seems
 likely to dictate increased gov-
 ernment aid to Algeria over the
 remaining four years of the Con-
 stantine Plan and stepped-up
 government pressures and incen-
 tives to encourage the movement
 of private capital.   An end to
 the rebellion might enlarge
 available resources by freeing
 for economic and social projects
 part of the funds now devoted to
 military operations.
 Even full achievement of
 the Constantine Plan, however,
 is unlikely to result in more
 than limited improvement in the
 over-all Algerian economic posi-
 tion as it appears likely to de-
 velop over the next few years.
 The rapid rate of population in-
 crease is certain to outstrip
 plans for new housing and new
 jobs and to complicate the school
 situation.   Large-scale land re-
 distribution will probably meet
 resistance from French landown-
 ers., 'Raising.wages would weaken
 one of the big incentives for
 private industry to move to Al-
 geria.

 states of Africa have  lower
 priorities and more   moderate
 budgets than those devoted to
 Algeria.   The problem of  the
 gap between the costs of polit-
 ically desirable projects  and
 available capital is the same,
 however.   The amount of eco-
 nomic aid France can                    provide
 these areas is likely to be a
 major factor in their willing-
 ness to maintain some degree of
 association with France.   The
 Mali Federation, for example,
 has ahknowledged that it seeks
 independence within the  French
 Community in order to keep
 getting French economic aid.
 From 1946 to 1958  France
 spent approximately $2 billion
 in economic aid  within the
 French Union.  Minister of Eco-
 nomic Cooperation Robert Le-
 court envisages 1960  grants
 totaling $200,000,000 for
 personnel, technical aid,   de-
 velopment projects, and      in-
 vestments.
 New oCa.pital
 Paris has expressed willing-
 ness to use part of the antici-
 pated income from Saharan  oil
 to finance its aid programs. To
 date this has largely been lim-
 ited to higher wages for  Al-
 gerians working in the oil in-
 dustry.   As France becomes a
 net exporter of oil, however,
 Paris may find it possible to
 channel an' increasing part of
 these new revenues into an ex-
 panded Algerian aid program.
 The Common  Organization of
 Saharan Regions (OCRS)--headed
 by Deputy Premier Jacques Sous-
 telle, whose jurisdiction  exa
 tends into the Saharan areas of
 the neighboring Community states
 of Chad, Niger, Mauritania, and
 Soudan--may serve as an instru-
 ment for distributing Saharan
 oil revenues and administering
 the aid programs.   The  OCRS
 has already entered into finan-
 cial agreements with these Sa-
 haran states.
 The European Economic Commu-
 nity (EEC) may become an  im-
 portant new source of capital.
 The EEC Development Fund,planned
 to finance economic and social
 aid projects in overseas terri-
 tories associated with EEC mem-
 bers, has scheduled $581,000,000
 to be spent from 1958 to 1962.
 Although France will contribute
 only $200,000,000 of that total,
 $511,000,000 is earmarked for
 areas linked to France.
 Although French reluctance
 to permit the  Development Fund
 to deal directly with the  Com-
 munity states has delayed fund
 planning and held up expendi-
 ture of most of the amount pro-
 gramed for 1958, recently                                                               re-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SAY
 10 December 1959
 The armed forces and the
 agrarian reform machinery have
 been penetrated by Communists
 whose potential for infiltrat-
 ing the economic organizations
 of the state was greatly  en-
 hanced by the appointment on
 26 November of "Che" Guevara
 to head the National Bank. Os-
 mani Cienfuegos, named minister
 of public works the same day,
 is the first probable Communist
 to secure a post in the cabi-
 net
 In contrast to  Communist
 policy in Guatemala during the
 Arbenz regime, when an attempt
 was made rapidly to build  a
 mass party, the PSP in Cuba ap-
 pears to be concentrating on
 quality rather than quantity.
 The slow recruitment and empha-
 sis on indoctrination suggest
 considerable care in the selec-
 tion of new members, particular-
 ly in view of the extremely
 favorable conditions existing
 for the party's growth.
 Cuban Communists appear to
 realize that the freedom they
 now enjoy is still dependent on
 the toleration of Fidel Castro
 and that overstepping  the
 bounds would cause Castro  to
 react against them.  Only  in
 organized labor have the Commu-
 nists gone to the extent of an-
 tagonizing pro-Castro elements in
 an c  e~ ;f ,gbi~;4O:.. Oxtsfld ' ,:tlie+3a ?, ;,,
 influence.
 .   Castro has publicly de-
 clared that he will never per-
 mit the revolution to be stolen
 from him or from his 26 of July
 Movement.  What the Communists
 evidently hope to achieve in the
 near future is acceptance into
 the government with control over
 economic sources of power and
 such potent groups as the armed
 forces and organized labor.
 Their pose as the stanchest de-
 fenders of the revolution tends
 to further these objectives.
 Formal seizure of power is
 probably not an immediate Com-
 munist objective.   It is already
 evident that the present regime,
 partially because it is nominal-
 ly non-Communist, may be serving
 world Communist objectives as
 effectively as would an outright
 Communist government--through
 its bitter anti-US propaganda
 throughout Latin America, its
 disruption of private US invest-
 ments, and the implicit threat
 to US security interests in the
 Caribbean area.
 On the other hand, a grow-
 ing number of observers, includ-
 ing former Costa Rican President
 Jose Figueres, maintain that the
 real Communist objective in Cuba
 is to create a situation that
 would force the United States to
 intervene militarily.   Such  a
 "Hungary in reverse" would be a
 potent propaganda weapon for Moscow.

 class, which is larger  and
 more influential in Cuba than
 in most Latin American coun-
 tries, several important fac-
 tors remain strongly in his
 favor.  The bulk of the Cuban
 people, especially those in
 the lowest economic strata,
 continue their strong emotion-
 al attachment to him.   The
 core of military and admin-
 istrative officials is also
 dedicated to him. His virtual
 monopoly of plans for social
 and economic reform, which the
 majority of Cubans regard  as
 desirable and necessary, also
 enhances his position.   The
 opposition, divided and lack-
 ing effective leadership, of-
 fers the public little in the
 way of a desirable alternative
 to Castro.
 The course of the  regime
 in the near future is likely
 to be further to the left and
 increasingly authoritarian.
 Castro has firmly stated that
 there will be no national elec-
 tions until the objectives of
 the revolution are realized--
 at best many years from now.
 He considers the politi-
 cal processes associated with
 elections as serving merely to
 confuse and divide the people
 --a view that has not led to
 strong opposition to him,since
 most Cuba ns, f rom gears ' of ex-
 perience with corrupt politi-
 cians, take a cynical view of
 elections.   The gigantic mass
 rallies organized periodically
 to endorse Castro's policies
 enable him to claim overwhelm-
 ing popular support.   Meanwhile,
 he is resorting to many of the
 same tactics he violently at-
 tacked during his war on the
 Batista dictatorship.
 The effects of the drastic
 and hastily implemented reforms
 could eventually be so disrup-
 tive as to bring economic col-
 lapse.   Such a collapse is not
 believed imminent, however. The
 expanded economic functions
 being assumed by the State will
 partially compensate for  the
 drying up of foreign and do-
 mestic private investment. The
 state, by such measures as  a
 unified tax program, public
 bond issues, and the "patriotic
 contributions" from organized
 labor and other groups, has
 more thoroughly mobilized the
 sources of domestic revenue
 than had its predecessors.   If
 necessary, it is likely to re-
 sort to more drastic measures,
 even to the forced transfer of
 private savings to government
 bonds.
 Agrarian reform has pro-
 gressed rapidly and is revolu-
 tionizing rural Cuba.   The re-
 form law passed in May has been
 stringently and often arbitrar-
 ily interpreted, particularly
 against extensive cattle hold-
 ings.   Apparently these have
 been taken over without formal
 expropriation or compensation,
 and much of the land has already
 been turned into cooperatives
 under control of the National
 Agrarian Reform Institute (INRA),
 rather than distributed--as
 promised--among the peasants
 who work it.
 INRA Director Nunez said
 on 4 December that 485 produc-
 tion cooperatives and 440 con-
 ,sumer cooperatives, probably
 "peoples' stores," were operat-

 \\duction have not as yet caused
 severe shortages or, at least
 in rural areas, substantial
 price increases, since the "peo-

 ter next spring's harvest.  The
 immediate effect is unlikely
 to reduce production substan-
 tially.   There are persistent
 rumors that Cuba may abandon
 the International Sugar Agree-
 ment and seek to increase its
 exports above its assigned
 quota.   If all restrictions
 were lifted, Cuba could prob-
 ably double its sugar produc-
 tion.   Some Cubans maintain
 that by Concentrating on volume
 of sales, Cuba could afford to
 consider price a secondary fac-
 tor.   Others believe it doubt-
 ful whether Cuba could find suf-
 ficient markets to dispose  of
 greatly expanded sugar exports,
 even at very low prices.
 Cuba's foreign exchange re-
 serves, already at an abnormal-
 ly low level, will go even low-
 er before the proceeds of the
 coming sugar harvest begin to
 arrive in January.   On taking
 over as National Bank head,
 Guevara admitted that a petiod
 of austerity may be required.
 Guevara, now in a position to
 determine the allocation of
 foreign exchange, will attempt
 to shift the pattern of Cuban
 trade away from dependence on
 the United States--an objective
 he considers a requisite to
 real Cuban independence.  He is
 likely also to promote barter
 trade in an attempt to conserve
 exchange.
 Foreign Affairs
 Castro's basic suspicion
 of US motives, which he  ex-
 ploits in his demagogic attempts
 to mobilize his mass following,
 strongly suggests that Cuban-
 US relations are unlikely to
 improve appreciably as long as
 he remains in power.   It is
 notable, however, that private
 American property has not yet
 been subjected to discriminatory
 treatment, and agrarian reform
 appears thus far to have been
 implemented impartially as re-
 gards holdings of foreigners.
 On the broader internation-
 al scene, Cuba served notice at
 the opening of the  UN  General
 Assembly last September that it
 intends to follow a neutralist
 policy in the "cold war."   By
 abstaining on the UN moratorium
 on Chinese representation, Cuba
 broke the solid Latin American
 front against admitting Commu-
 nist China to the UN.   There is
 evidence that "'Che" Guevara has
 become an important influence
 in the formulation of this "neu-
 tralist" foreign policy since
 his return from a three-month
 trip last summer to nine Afro-
 Asian countries and Yugoslavia.
 Cuba's efforts to convince
 other Latin American  nations
 that their interests would be
 served by joining the Afro-Asian
 countries in a neutralist bloc
 have not yet been effective.
 Other Latin American govern-
 ments--even that of Venezuela,
 which materially supported Cas-
 tro's war on Batista--are alarmed
 at the course of events.  Cuba
 appears to be seeking its ob-
 jectives by appealing over the
 heads of the governments to
 disaffected elements in several
 Latin American countries.
 The new Cuban-subsidized
 Latin American news agency,
 Prensa Latina, has played an
 active propaganda role in this
 effort, and the several offi-
 cially inspired Cuban "revolu-
 tionary" missions sent to var-
 ious Latin American countries
 have had a frankly propagan-
 distic purpose.   The resolu-
 tion passed at the congress of
 the Cuban Workers' Confederation

 to found a "revolutionary"
 Latin American confederation,
 to name labor attaches to Cu-
 ban diplomatic missions abroad,
 and to send special labor emis-
 saries throughout Latin America
 to spread the word of the Cu-
 ban revolution is a further
 indication of a stepped-up ef-
 fort to reach disaffected and
 extremist labor elements else-
 where in the hemisphere.
 In some instances the Cu-
 bans have resorted to direct
 subversion.   The revolutionary
 incursions into Nicaragua and
 the Dominican Republic last
 summer were clearly mounted by
 Cuban officials.   The incur-
 sions into Panama and Haiti may
 also have been.   More subtle
 methods were evident in Panama,
 where Cuban "newsmen" were
 prominent in organizing and
 leading the nationalist  anti-
 US demonstrations against the
 Canal  Zone  on  28  Novem-
 ber.
 The Sino-Soviet bloc, par-
 ticularly Communist China, has
 shown considerable interest in
 Cuban developments.   Moscow
 views Castro's advent in Cuba
 as a "turning point" marking
 "a new stage in the national
 liberation struggle in Latin
 America" and has welcomed the
 opportunities for Soviet exploi-
 tation.   Several bloc economic
 missions have visited Cuba, bid
 on projects, and reportedly of-    25X1
 fered credits.   Cuban economic
 delegations have been welcomed
 to bloc countries.
