 G'l~i~ra: L'oKfuc~us ,Na Say
 Chou  En-lai  recently  became  the  first
 Chinese official to comment publicly on the anti-
 Confucius campaign. Chows remarks, made dur-
 ing a  February 24 speech at a banquet for Zam-
 bian  President  Kaunda, should  put to  rest the
 frequent press speculation that the Premier is a
 target of the campaign. Although there has been
 no  official  statement  on  the  objectives of  the
 drive, Peking has moved forcefully to deny for-
 eign press reports that Chou is a target, that the
 campaign will prompt a change in foreign policy,
 or that it is a new Cultural Revolution':
 Criticism of Confucius began last August but
 did   not  become  a  full-fledged  campaign  until
 early February. The announcement on February
 2 that this campaign was the first order of busi-
 ness was preceded by careful planning, including
 specific  measures  to  keep the campaign  under
 strict party control. Teng Hsiao-ping, known as a
 rigid  disciplinarian, was added  to the Politburo
 even as the propaganda was touting the virtues of
 maintaining  party  discipline'~~In  January,  the
 Central  Committee  issued a series of directives,
 including  one that set clear  limitations on  the
 conduct of the campaign~~
 The directive is obviously aimed at prevent-
 ing t e kind of turmoil that erupted during the
 Cultural Revolution. It reportedly prohibits travel
 around the country to "exchange experiences," a
 feature of the Cultural Revolution that resulted in
 nationwide disorder as unruly youths roamed the
 country at will. It also bans attacks by name on
 specific individuals."
 ~,, The latter stricture has not been well imple-
 ment d, however, and Peking has felt it necessary
 to restate its position. On February 20, an author-
 itative editorial in People's Daily warned that the
 campaign must'stay on the "correct course" and
 must not become "entangled" with "other prob-
 lems." For several months, young students have
 been attacking individual teachers for all manner
 of  real  or  imagined wrong-doings; petty thieves
 were also being criticized~~and at least one factory
 manager  came  under  at ac   rAlthough  the ac-
 cusers all claim that their cri icism is consistent
 with  the  anti-Confucius  drive,  it  is  clear  that
 Peking is trying to put a stop to just such activity1
 Ithough  in  some  instances the campaign
 has become bogged down in local issues, the prov-
 inces for the most part are stir_king closely to the
 official line coming from Peking. The situation is
 under such  controll[that some Chinese  officials
 have already begun to speculate when the cam-
 paign will end. Chinese estimates range from three
 to six  months before Peking calls a halt to the
 criticism  of  Confuciu"s~  Before  that time,  it  is

 Latin America: The Ne~v Dialogue
 ;Latin American and Caribbean foreign minis-
 ters have returned home from their meeting with
 Secretary Kissinger in Mexico City last week with
 .mixed  feelings  about  what  was  accomplished.
 i here has been insufficient time for the partici-
 ,r3ating  governments  to  have reached  firm  con-
 ~lusions  about  the  meetings,  and  early  com-
 mentaries  by the area's public media have typi-
 cally run the gamut from cynical negativism to
 ~aroud  satisfaction.  More  measured  official  re-
 actions will trickle in for weeks to come, but a
 preliminary reading suggests that most of the 24
 I__atin and Caribbean governments that attended
 regard  the  conference  as  a  promising  starting
 point fora healthy new dialogue with the US.
 They  generally  look  forward  to  resuming  the
 dialogue in Atlanta in mid-P~pril just prior to the
 meeting ,there  of  the  fourth  OAS  General
 Assembly.
 Although their comments to date about the
 meeting's  concrete  results  have  been  under-
 standably guarded, most of the participants who
 have spoken up since the rr~eeting have been en-
 thusiastic  about  its  style.  They generally have
 e;:hoed the satisfaction shown by Mexican For-
 eign  Minister  Rabasa  in  his speech closing the
 conference when  he mentioned the feeling that
 "here, for the first time in zi long while, we have
 met on a plane of absolute equality."~
 ;Some  of  those  who  attended  have  also
 spoken proudly of the fact -that the Latins them-
 selves  were  able  for  the  first  time  in  such  a
 meeting with the US to attain and preserve a high
 degree of unity on the subjects discussed. Latin
 solidarity was in fact impressive, but it did show
 strains when issues like Cuba, the revision of the
 inter-American system, and the wording of the
 final communique arose for discussion inside and
 outside  the  formal  sessions.  It  was  only with
 considerable  pulling and  hauling that the dele-
 gates were able to agree on one Latin spokesman
 to respond in the name of alt to Secretary Kis-
 singer's  comments on  each  agenda  item. Some
 delegates privately bridled at what they regarded
 as  the  high-handed  way that  Mexico, the host
 government,  ran the meetings. Mexico itself ap-
 peared very pleased, both with the conduct of the
 conference  itself and  with the  "Declaration  of
 Tlatelolco" concluding the conference:?
 The two  issues that  produced the deepest
 cleavage between some of the Latin American and
 Caribbean delegates on the one hand and the US
 on the other were the US suggestion that a new
 "hemispheric  community"  be  formed  and  the
 Cuban  question, which  cropped  up  informally.
 Some  of  the  area's  more  nationalistic  govern-
 ments vehemently rejected the "community" idea
 because they saw it as a possible new vehicle for
 what they regard as US domination. A few dele-
 gates-notably  those  of  Jamaica,  Guyana,  and
 Peru-sought to force the group to discuss the
 exclusion  of Cuba from the inter-American sys-
 tem,  but  they  received  little  support.  Neither
 problem  loomed  so  large  as  to  dominate  the

 conference,  although  Cuban  and  Soviet  press
 commentary trumpeted both issues and made it
 appear that way."
 >C"? Cuba has yet to react directly to the discus-
 sions at Tlatelolco. Prensa Latina, the Cuban wire
 service,  sent  considerable  caustic  commentary
 from Mexico to Havana during the course of the
 meetings. The main theme of this reportage was
 perhaps  best conveyed  in  the comment, attri-
 buted to a Central American delegate, that the US
 had "offered us, under new titles, the same old
 State Department cliches." Tass also played up
 the same alleged remark and was generally only
 slightly less critical than the Cuban wire service.

 ,The  dollar  dropped  further  against  most
 mayor currencies in hectic trading during the past
 week. Daily changes in value sometimes exceeded
 2 percent as energy-triggered  uncertainties con-
 tinued to dominate currency  markets.  Central
 banks  did  not  intervene  substantially  to  limit
 daily fluctuations in exchange rates or to halt the
 dollar's  general  decline.  Since  February  1, the
 dollar has depreciated nearly 4 percent against the
 mark, 2 percent against the pound, and 4 percent
 against the yen. The price of gold surged to a new
 high  of  $175  per  ounce  on  February  26, up
 nearly 50 percent so far this year; it eased slightly
 on February 28 after some profit-taking.
 The  dollar's  weakness  reflects  a  growing
 realization that the Europeans and Japanese will
 be able to finance much of the rise in their oil
 import  bills  by  borrowing; thus,  they  will  be
 under less pressure than anticipated to depreciate
 their currencies or draw on foreign reserves.
 Rome is planning to float a new $1.5-billion
 foreign  loan.  It also will  be able to draw on a
 recently  negotiated  $1.2-billion  standby  credit
 from  the  International  Monetary  Fund and to
 utilize new arrangements for increased short-term
 currency  swaps  with the US.  In  France, some
 state agencies will apparently follow the lead of
 the treasury and Electricite de France in seeking
 foreign  capital. The treasury and the electrical
 agency have already obtained  loans totaling $2
 billion. The Danes announced plans for a loan in
 marks equivalent to $37 million, and substantial
 further borrowing by the Scandinavians is likely.
 The  dramatic  rise  in the price of gold  is
 attributable mainly to  increased speculative de-
 mand brought on by uncertainties about the fate
 of major currencies. Reduced gold sales by South
 Africa and renewed expectations that the EC will
 raise its official price for gold sharply have also

 L  rWith the Mexico meeting now over, Latin
 American and Caribbean governments will begin
 focusing on  how best to refine their arguments
 and seek further US actions in their favor at the
 April  meetings  in  Atlanta,  where most of the
 issues raised in Mexico will again come up. In the
 interim, they will speak loudly, mostly for home
 consumption, about the need for Washington to
 do more for them. But privately, most will remain
 guardedly hopeful that the new impetus they see
 in US -Latin American relations can be nurtured
 and sustai ed.

 ISRAEL: POLITICAL FRUSTI~ATIONS
 ;~; ;Prime Minister Meir spent a trying week at-
 tempting to broaden her minority coalition, while
 seeking to forestall its early collapse. Continuing
 difficulty with both tasks led President Katzir to
 give her another week to form  a cabinet. Last
 week, he gave an informal extension of seven days
 to name a cabinet after she refused to request a
 formal three-week extension of her original man-
 date, which expired on February 20. Mrs. Nleir
 now  plans  to  present  her  new cabinet to the
 Knesset for a vote of confidence on March 5.
 `: ~  The  Prime Minister clearly wants the addi-
 tiona~ time to coax the National Religious Party
 and  recalcitrant Labor Alignment ministers into
 the cabinet.  More moderate leaders of the Na-
 tional  Religious Party apparently are still  hesi-
 tating  to  go  against  the wishes of the party's
 ultra-orthodox  youth  faction.  As  a  result, the
 party has continued to reject all overtures. Labor
 leaders are now concerned that the National Re-
 ligious Party may act in concert with the rightist
 Fikud to block legislation in N:nesset committees)
 ~rying to hold her own Alignment factions
 ~to~jet er,  Mrs.  Meir  addressed  several  personal
 appeals  to  Defense  Minister  Dayan and Trans-
 portation Minister Peres to remain in the govern-
 ment; she reportedly even offered Dayan the post
 of foreign minister. Her hopes were given a boost
 when the Rafi faction, of which both are leading
 members, endorsed Mrs. Meir's move tv form a
 minority cabinet and urged both men to join.
 ~~Peres, who would like to remain in the cabi-
 net and even called on Dayan to stay, will follow
 Dayan's lead. The Defense Minister, for his part,
 appears to  be holding out for stronger support
 from  all  Alignment factions  before making his
 final decision. the Alignment factions have estab-
 lished a "reconciliation committee" to formulate
 proposals  on  overcoming  the  intra-party crisis,
 but the committee, at best, is likely only to gloss
 over party differences.
 =;   Meanwhile, the  Independent Liberal Party,
 the' Alignment's  junior  coalition  partner,  is
 maneuvering for more representation in the cabi-
 net.  Mrs.  Meir has agreed to give  it one more
 cabinet seat in addition to that held by Minister
 of -(ourism Moshe Kola
 ~~ ` I n contrast to the lack of movement on the
 do  estic  political  scene, a  major breakthrough
 was  made  on  the  Syrian  disengagement  issue
 when Damascus presented Tel Aviv, through Sec-
 retary Kissinger, with a list of the 65 Israeli POWs
 it holds and said Red Cross officials could begin
 visiting them on March 1. Mrs. Meir announced
 that Israel was now prepared to conduct negotia-
 tions with  Damascus on  a separation  of forces
 agreement
 Ilsraeli  political  observers are playing down
 'Elie possibility that Mrs. Meir's minority cabinet
 would  have  difficulty  beginning disengagement
 talks, arguing that the principles held by such a
 cabinet are shared by a majority of Knesset mem-
 bers.

 l-laile Selassie to appoint a new government
 appointees  named  so  far are  likely to be more               ~~   The revolt began on February 26 when army

 sors, and their selection represents a determined  ~- cers           in  Asmara,  Ethiopia's second  largest city,
 effort by the Emperor to reach some accommoda-?~~, went on  strike and  placed their senior officers
 tion with the dissident troops, whose demands are ~             under restraint. The situation worsened on Febru-
 focused mainly on economic issues. The situation, ~ ~ ary 27 when some elements close to Addis Ababa
 however, will probably remain unsettled for some                joined  in  and  the  dissident  troops  in  Asmara
 time.  The  new  government  will  have  to  act                placed  under  house  arrest  most  of  the senior
 quickly if it is to restore public confidence. It is
 not clear how much authority Haile Selassie will
 grant  the  new  prime  minister,  Endalkatchew
 Makonnen, or even if the new appointees will be
 acceptable to the dissidents. The new cabinet at a
 minimum  will  have to make concessions to the
 troops' economic demands
 exceed  the immediate economic issues. Enlisted
 men and NCOs have been the most visible partici-
 pants in the revolt, but many junior- and middle-
 level  officers  are  showing  increased  political
 awareness.  There  is growing evidence that they
 are  in  touch  with  each  other and with discon-
 tented  civilians. These groups are now likely to
 exert  stronger  pressure  for  implementation  of
 long-postponed  reforms,  and  their  efforts  are
 likely to call into question the Emperor's virtually
 unlimited  authority.  The  officers  and  enlisted
 men, and probably most of the civilians, remain
 loyal to Haile Selassie, but they would prefer that
 the  daily  administration  of the government  be
 placed  in the hands of officials chosen more for
 their competence than for their royal favor and

 RHODESIA: INSURGENCY CONTINUES
 The  African  nationalist  insurgency  against
 Prim  Minister  Smith's  white-minority  govern-
 ment is now well into its second year. Although
 the  rebels  remain  confined  to  the  large  and
 sparsely populated northeastern area where they
 began operating in December 1972, they appear
 capable of continuing their activities indefinitely:
 The rebels are well supplied with Communist
 arms-mostly  Chinese-and  continue  to  receive
 help from their anti-Portuguese  counterparts in
 Mozambique, who assist them to cross into Rho-
 desia from Zambia and Tanzania
 ~'   Smith's government has been unable to halt
 this infiltration even with the help of some 1,400
 South  African  police  who  operate  against the
 guerrillas  inside  Rhodesia  anti who als   relieve
 Rhodesian forces of routine border patrol.
 ~~  The  rebels  have  suffered  some  setbacks.
 hey have been unable for example, to maintain
 the  high  level  of  terrorist  attacks  on  isolated
 white  farms  that  they  recorded  initially; local
 defense measures against such attacks have proven
 quite  effective.  Moreover,  support  from  rural
 Africans seems to have fallen off despite resent-
 ment over the government's forced resettlement
 program and harsh security Iegislatiort~Since last
 {~ June at  least 8,000 local inhabitants have been
 moved from  the frontier zone, and the govern-
 ment claims that some 3,000 of these have reset-
 tled voluntarily  in "protected villages" built by
 the government
 '_;~  The Rhodesian economy, on the whole, has
 held up well under the added strains imposed by
 the insurgency. The economy suffers from a man-
 power shortage, however, and civilian morale has
 been  affected  because  of the large number of
 white reservists who have been on almost contin-
 ual active duty. In early February the government
 announced measures intended to reduce call-ups
 of white reservists without cutting back on the
 counter-insurgency effort. The measures included
 earlier  conscription  of  white  youths,  increased
 incentives for conscripts to r~e-enlist, and forma-
 tion of a second black infantry battalion.

 Over the long run, other developments may
 take a heavier toll on the economy and on white
 morale than the insurgency. For example, white
 immigration declined significantly last year, prob-
 ably  in  part  because  of  the guerrilla war. Al-
 though  the country showed a small net gain of
 immigrants for 1973, the figure was substantially
 lower than the  1972 total.  Last month, Smith
 announced  a  world-wide  campaign  to  attract
 white settlers.
 Developments  in  neighboring Mozambique
 could  also  affect  Rhodesia's  prospects.  Rebels
 there have become more active in recent weeks
 and have carried out a number of attacks on the
 rail line from the port of Beira to Salisbury, one
 of Rhodesia's vital lifelines.

 EC-ARAB COOPERATION
 ?;~' 3~~
 The nine  ~ countries are planning to ex-
 plore  wide-ranging  cooperation  with  the  Arab
 states despite some concern that Washington may
 view such talks with disapproval. Even those EC
 states that are cooperating with  the  US in the
 activities following the Washington Energy Con-
 ference see the new effort as a way to assert an
 independent role for Europe in relations with the
 Arabs. They point out that:
 ? the  European  moves  can  complement
 US policy;
 ? the practical effect of the Nine's efforts
 will, in any case, be long term;
 ? the attempt is necessary to heal the rift
 with France within the community.
 At a meeting in Brussels set for March 4, the
 foreign ministers of the EC are expected to give
 final  approval  to  the  proposal,  first  made  by
 France, for cooperation with the Arabs in a vari-
 ety of fields. As a first step, the West Germans-
 presently  holding the chairmanship of the com-
 munity  bodies-would  inform the Arab govern-
 ments of the interest of the Nine in early continu-
 ation  of the dialogue  initiated when four Arab
 leaders visited Copenhagen during the summit of
 EC leaders last December. Foreign Minister Scheel
 would  ask the  Arabs to designate one or more
 representatives for future contacts in such fields
 as  industry,  agriculture,  energy,  raw  materials,
 science  and  technology,  financial  cooperation,
 and  vocational  training.  In  the  next phase, the
 European and  Arab states could  establish joint
 committees to work out the principles and possi-
 bilities of cooperation in detail. A conference of
 Arab and  European  ministers, which would de-
 cide how to implement the cooperative measures,
 would  be convened,  perhaps  in the autumn of
 1974.
 The  plan  for  cooperation  was worked out
 earlier this year by a group of Middle East experts
 from the foreign ministries of the EC states, and
 was approved by the political directors in early
 February. The cooperative venture would include
 matters within the purview of the EC as well as
 others-such  as cultural  relations-that are  out-
 side.  For  this  reason,  the  political  committee
 recommended that the German foreign minister
 should  carry  on  the  negotiations  in  both  his
 roles-as  president  of  the  political  consultative
 group and as president of the EC Council.
 A number of EC members are pressing for
 early action, with an eye on the rotational pattern
 for the EC presidency. The West Germans are in
 the chair until July, but the French will take over
 for the following six  months, followed  by the
 somewhat Francophile Irish. Paris could thus reap
 inordinate political benefit from a delay of several
 months in initiating the negotiations.
 EC  circles are  nevertheless wary  of  Wash-
 ington's reaction to EC-Arab moves. Reports are
 circulating in Brussels that the US is adamantly
 opposed to the prospect of an EC dialogue with
 the Arabs. The West Germans have been at pains
 to  emphasize their  determination  that the  EC-
 Arab dialogue should  neither conflict with nor
 burden the US peace efforts in the Middle East.
 Some Europeans believe that the US is opposed
 to  possible  EC offers of technical  help to the
 comprehensive  aid-for-oil  agreement.

 IRAQ: TRUCE WITH KURDS EXPIRING
 '~ 9J,~ a   :;c, to ~,ty ~ ~
 The truce that halted figftting four years ~go
 between the central government and Iraqi Kurds
 led by Mulla Mustafa Barzani is due to expire on
 March 11. Unless it is extended, an early resump-
 tion of hostilities seems likely; the two sides have
 not agreed on even basic provisions of the autono-
 mous status promised to the Kurds.
 Iraq's two million Kurds constitute about 18
 percent  of  its population.  In  March  1970,  the
 Baghdad  government  promised  to grant auton-
 omy within  four years to areas of northeastern
 Iraq  where the  Kurds are  in  a majority.  Since
 then, the Kurdish areas have remained generally
 quiet  except  for occasional  limited  clashes be-
 tween Barzani's forces and local army units.
 For  some  time,  however,  and  apparently
 with some justification, the Kurds have been ac-
 cusing the government of trying to  reduce the
 area in which Kurds predominate by forcing en-
 tire  villages  to migrate  north  and east and  re-
 placing them with Arabs.
 Last  December,  the  government  finally
 offered a sketchy autonomy plan that the Kurds
 generally view as a device to keep ultimate au-
 thority  in  Baghdad.  The  Kurds  want  a  larger
 "autonomous area," greater representation in the
 central  government,  and  more  of the  national
 budget. They are also uneasy about the future of
 the Kurdish armed forces.
 The  most important bone of contention is
 control of the Kirkuk oil fields. The Kurds claim
 that: the entire Kirkuk area is within their rightful
 area of jurisdiction, but the government strongly
 contests  this  claim.  If the  Kurds  refuse to go
 along with the government's autonomy plan, as

 seems  probable,  Baghdad  may try to impose it
 anyway, hoping to enlist the support of some of
 Barzani's rivals. In that event, renewed fighting on
 a large scale would seem certain.
 Barzani's  Kurdish  force,  which  numbers
 about  30,000  men  with  an  estimated  50,000
 tribesmen  in  reserve,  is  reported  to  have  been
 re-equipped  recently with new weapons, largely
 with  Iran's help.  The  Kurds  lack armor, heavy
 artillery, and air support, but they are capable of
 defending  their  mountainous  homeland,  where
 heavy equipment would be of little use. They are
 also capable of guerrilla forays that could prove
 costly to local army units, as well as to the oil
 fields in the north. Government forces have better
 equipment, but would have to keep one eye on
 the Iranian border, where recent clashes have in-
 creased tensions.
 MOROCCO: RESTLESS ON THRONE DAY
 An atmosphere of  uneasiness~prevai~s with/
 the approach of March 3, the 13th anniversary of
 King Hassan's accession to the throne. A year ago
 on the same date, short-lived disorders broke out
 in central Morocco.
 The  government  is  concerned  over  the
 security  situation  and  has  taken  a  number of
 precautionary measures. Security patrols in Rabat
 and Casablanca have been increased, and numer-
 ous road blocks have been set up throughout the
 country. The local rumor mill and the announce-
 ment that a small group of Moroccan dissidents
 was  recently captured  after crossing the border
 from Algeria have also made the public nervous.
 The government believes the current subver-
 sion  is  backed  by  Libya.  Tripoli  has  made  no
 attempt to hide its hostility to King Hassan since
 President Qadhafi  prematurely gave  public sup-
 port to a coup attempt against Hassan in 1971.
 Military officers, from whose ranks came the
 leaders of two abortive coup attempts within the
 past three years, remain the chief threat to the
 King. Following the last attempt in 1972, Hassan
 assumed direct control of the armed forces, exe-
 cuted those officers who were implicated, isolated
 potential  challengers  in  the  military,  and  dis-
 persed most of the units upon which a military
 contender might rely.
 While these actions have tightened Hassan's
 control  of  the  military,  many  officers  are  in-
 creasingly  restive  because of  their direct subor-
 dination to the King and Morocco's lack of mod-
 ern  military  equipment.  There  is  no firm  evi-
 dence,  however,  of organized opposition within
 the armed forces.
 Hassan has sought to prevent another chal-
 lenge  from  the  military  in part by balancing it
 against the security services. His growing reliance
 on  Colonel  Ahmed  Dlimi,  his chief intelligence
 adviser, may be weighting the scales too far the
 other way, however. Although there have been no
 signs that Dlimi is becoming disaffected, he may
 soon be in a position powerful enough to engineer
 or facilitate a coup.
 Hassan  continues to demonstrate consider-
 able   skill  in  political  manipulation  as well as a
 willingness to deal summarily with dissident activ-
 ity. The concentration of effective power in the
 palace has increased rather than diminished over
 the past three years; opposition political parties
 are  as weak and divided as ever. Moreover, the
 throne has some popular support as a symbol of
 legitimacy,  and  the King's narrow escapes from
 the two coup attempts are seen by many as proof
 of divine favor.  Nevertheless,  the  King remains
 vulnerable to a coup generated by his own refusal
 to change his method of governing or to eliminate
 official  corruption.

 EASTERN EUROPE: FORE:IG~I TRADE BOOM
 tip  d ~'~")
 Eastern  Europe s f~reign trade boomed  in
 197, and most of the countries plan even larger
 growth this year. While Eastern Europe as a whole
 accumulated a record hard??currency deficit with
 the West,  its trade with tlhe Soviet  Union  was
 again in surplus.
 Total trade grew some 17 percent last year-
 double the average annual rate for 1960-72-and a
 20-percent increase is planned for 1974. With the
 exception of Hungary, all the countries ran hard-
 currency  deficits.  Total  debt to the developed
 West-almost $5 billion at 'the end of 1972-grew
 substantially. Poland and Czechoslovakia amassed
 record hard-currency deficits of $1 billion and
 $300 million, respectively. East European imports
 were paced by large purchases of high-priced agri?~
 cultural  products and  raw  materials-corn, soy~~
 beans, and cattle hides. V1lestern machinery and
 equipment also  remained  in high demand, witrl
 purchases  by  Romania and  Poland  leading the
 way.
 Eastern  Europe's  large  surplus  with  th~~
 Soviet Union last year reflected the USSR's con-
 tinued heavy purchase of consumer goods. Soviet
 deliveries of fuels and other raw materials were on
 schedule. Planned deliveries of these commodities
 through  1975  should  be sufficient to forestall
 major energy problems in f=astern Europe.
 Poland and Romania, the countries with the
 fastest growing trade withl the West, do not plan
 to cut back on their purchasing this year. Czecho-
 slovakia  also  is  likely  'to  buy  more  Western
 machinery. East Germany will probably reduce its
 trade with the West, while machinery imports by
 Hungary and Bulgaria will rise moderately. This
 pattern will probably coni:inue through 1975.
 In the next plan period-1976-80-the East
 Europeans  face  serious  raw-material  supply

 in volume but cost substantially more. East Euro-
 pean  investments in the exploitation  of Soviet
 resources will not begin to pay off until late in
 the  1970s.  The  East  European  countries  are
 likely; therefore, to have to plan on reduced rates
 of  economic  growth  during  the  1976-80
 period.

 Paris has been troubled by what it regards as a
 Soviet failure to consult adequately  during the
 Middle East war, while Moscow has serious reser-
 vations about the interest the French are showing
 in  West European defense cooperation. The So-
 viets have also been disturbed by France's unwill-
 ingness to participate in MBFR, and may feel that
 this attitu~,ie is spreading to other West European
 countries./
 l-   I Many of these problems can only be resolved
 at the summit, if at all. Some progress may be
 made  during  President  Pompidou's trip  to  the
 USSR,  which  has  been  under consideration for
 some time. During Gromyko's stay in Paris, it was

 announced that tree trip will take place in early
 March,  probably  next  week.  Looking  further
 ahead, the Soviets, who are presumably aware of
 Pompidou's declining health, will have to consider
 the policy they will take toward France after his
 departure from the political scene'

 recently  been  displaying a  more  pragmatic ap-
 proach toward church-state relations in commu-

 European  regimes  with  large  Roman  Catholic
 populations have  been  responding  in kind, The
 Soviets probably believe that in an era of detente,
 with East-West contacts increasing, it is useful to
 neutralize a potential source of internal discord in
 Eastern Europe:
 While  in  Rome, Gromyko touched on the
 Middle East situation, expressing Moscow's irrita-

 negotiations. To reassert the Soviet role, the For-
