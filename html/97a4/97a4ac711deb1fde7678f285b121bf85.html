 MY FOUR DAYS IN PEKING. WE HAD CANDID AND SERIOUS
 TALKS ON A WIDE RANGE OF      INTERNATIONAL AND

 BEEN VERY USEFUL AND WILL REPORT  IN DETAIL
 ON THEM TO THE PRESIDENT UPON MY RETURN.

 OF OUR TWO GOVERNMENTS WHICH WILL CONTAINUE IN THE
 FUTURE. OUR TALKS ENHANCED OUR MUTUAL INDERSTANDING
 OF OUR RESPECTIVE POSITIONS  ON A WIDE RANGE OF
 ISSUES.   AS TO  INTERNATIONAL ISSUES,  OUR DISCUSSIONS
 TOUCHED ON MAJOR POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND
 STRATEGIC QUESTION RANGING ACROSS THE GLOBE.
 WE CONFIRMED THAT WE SHARE  IMPORTANT   COMMON
 CONCERNS ON MANY SUBJECTS.  AS FOR BILATERAL
 MATTERS WE HAD A MOST USEFUL EXCHANGE OF VIEWS.
 BOTH SIDES CLEARLY BELIEVE THAT PROGRESS
 AND NORMALIZATION OF OUR RELATIONS I N
 ACCORD WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE SHANGHAI
 COMMUNIQUE  IS IN OUR MUTUAL INTERESTS.  I LOOK
 FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR DISCUSSIONS. NOW,
 I  WILL BE HAPPY TO  TAKE QUESTION,
 Q :   M R .  SECRETARY, I N YOUR DISCUSSIONS OF
 INTERNATIONAL ISSUES WITH THE CHINESE WERE THERE
 AREAS OF THE WORLD WHERE THEY WEREN' S APPROVING OF
 AMERICAN POLICY AND COULD YOU POINT THOSE ARES OUT TO
 US?
 A:    WITHOUT GOING INTO DETAIL I WOULD SAY THERE ARE
 AREAS WITHIN THE WORLD I N WHICH THEY HAVE SOME
 DIFFERENCES OF  VIEWS,  WITH RESPECT TO OUR PARTICULAR
 COURSE OF ACTION THERE MAY BE DIFFERENCES IN TERMS OF
 NUANCES BUT IT WAS VERY USEFUL BECAUSE BOTH OF US DO
 HAVE GLOBAL INTERESTS TO CLEARLY DISCUSS THESE
 VAPIOUS ISSUES SO THAT WE UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHERS
 POSITIONS AND THUS WE CAN AVOID MISUNDERSTANDINGS  IN
 THE FUTURE.
 0:   MR.  SECRETARY:  WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE? YOU
 SAY THESE CONTACTS WILL CONTINUE, DO YOU FORESEE
 DISCUSSIONS IN WASHINGTON,  WHAT HAPPENS?
 A    I  DON'T WANT TO BE SPECIFIC AT THIS POINT OTHER
 THAN TO SAY THAT OUR DISCUSSIONS WILL CONTINUE.
 0:   WILL AMBASSADOR HUANG HLIA BE AT THE UNITED NATIONS?
 A:   MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT HE WILL BE ATTENDING THE
 GENERAL ASSEMBLY AT THE UNITED NATIONS. HE HIMSELF
 SHOULD SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO THAT.  I WOULD LOOK FORWARD
 TO  RETURNING THE  VERY KIND HOSPITALITY WHICH HE HAS EX-

 TENDED TO US WHEN HE COMES TO UNITED STATES.
 Q:  ON THE QUESTION OF NORMALIZATION,  AFTER THESE
 TALKS DO YOU FEEL THAT THE CHINESE HAVE A
 SENSE OF URGENCY ABOUT THE PROCESS OF NORMALIZATION
 OR DO WE HAVE AN INDEFINITE AMOUNT OF TIME
 FOR THEM?
 A.  I THINK  IT WOULD BE  INAPPROPRIATE FOR ME TO
 COMMENT ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF
 CHINA.  ANY SUCH QUESTIONS SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO
 THEM, WE BOTH HAVE EXPLAINED TO EACH OTHER OUR
 VIEWS IN DEPTH ON THE QUESTION OF NORMALIZATION AND
 THIS I  THINK HAS BEEN VERY USEFUL TO US AND APPROPRIATE.
 G: LET ME PUT IT TO YOU. DO YOU FEEL A SENSE OF URGENCY ABOUT
 THE PROCESS?
 A:  I  DON'T THINK IT  IS HELPFUL TO  CHARACTERIZE THE
 SITUATION IN TERMS OF URGENCY OR LACK OF URGENCY-
 I  HAVE A REPORT TO MAKE TO THE PRESIDENT WHEN  I
 GET HOME AND I  WILL REPORT TO HIM IN FULL DETAIL AT
 THAT TIME.  JUST A MINUTE, PLEASE. LET ME SAY THAT
 THIS WAS AN EXPLORATORY TRIP AS Ii SAID AT THE OUTSET
 AND  I  THINK AS CHAIRMAN HUA KUO-FENG SAID THIS
 AFTERNOON THAT  I T WAS  IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THESE
 EXPLORATORY _DISCUSSIONS.
 1, MR SECRETARY,  PRESIDENT CARTER WAS QUOTED
 IN AN INTERVIEW SOMETIME BEFORE YOUR DEPARTURE FROM
 WASHINGTON AS SAYING THAT THERE  WAS NO  URGENCY
 ON THE ISSUE OF RECOGNITION OR NORMALIZATION.
 DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT STATEMENT?

 A.  WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID IS OBVIOUSLY UNITED
 STATES POLICY.
 0:  DID YOU DISCUSS WITH THE CHINESE THE KINDS
 OF US-TAIWAN RELATIONS THEY MIGHT TOLERATE AND
 STILL PERMIT FULL RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES?
 A: AS I  INDICATED I AM NOT GOING INTO DETAILS,
 I  THINK IT WOULD BE IN APPROPRIATE FUR ME TO GO
 INTO DETAILS.  LET ME SAY THAT WE DISCUSSED THE
 PROCESS OF NORMALIZATION IN CONSIDERABLE DETAIL.
 0:  AFTER FOUR DAYS OF TALKS DO YOU FEEL THAT
 GENERALLY,  SINCE YOU DON'T WANT TO GO  INTO SPECIFICS,
 DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU ARE ANY CLOSER TO RESOLVING
 THIS MAJOR OBSTACLE TO NORMALIZATION?
 A:  AGAIN I WOULD REPEAT THAT THESE TALKS WERE
 EXPLORATORY.  I  THINK THAT THEY WERE USEFUL TALKS
 AND I THINK THAT AS A RESULT OF THAT BOTH OF US
 CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THE VIEWS OF EACH OTHER,  AND
 THAT I THINK HAS BEEN GOOD AND USEFUL.
 Q:  WELL THEN MAYBE,  MR. SECRETARY,  THE QUESTION
 OUGHT TO BE ARE WE FURTHER APART THAN BEFORE
 WE CAME HERE? THEY'RE USEFUL AND WE'RE STILL
 EXPLORING,  IS THERE GREATER DISTANCE NOW
 BETWEEN US AND THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC
 THAN THERE WAS BEFORE YOU CAME HERE?
 A:  THE ANSWER IS NO.
 Q:  MR.  SECRETARY,  IN HIS TOAST THE FOREIGN MINISTER
 SAID WE BELIEVE THAT SINO-US RELATIONS WILL SURELY
 MOVE FORWARD STEADILY AS DESIRED BY BOTH OUR
 PEOPLES SO LONG AS BOTH SIDES MAKE SINCERE EFFORTS
 IN CONFORMITY WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE SHANGHAI
 COMMUNIQUE,  DO YOU FEEL THAT  THE UNITED STATES IS
 MAKING SUCH A SINCERE EFFORT?
 A:  I DO,
 0:  IN YOUR TOAST AND THE FOREIGN MINISTER'S TOAST
 TONIGHT BOTH OF YOU MENTIONED POINTS  IN
 COMMON. COLD YOU  IDENTIFY THE POINTS IN COMMON?
 A:  AGAIN  I  THINK IT  IS  INAPPROPRIATE AT THIS POINT
 FOR ME TO GO  INTO DETAIL.  I  STILL HAVE TO REPORT
 T O THE PRESIDENT O F THE UNITED STATES.  I  THINK I T
 IS SIGNIFICANT THAT BOTH OF US HAVE  INDICATED  IN

 OUR TOASTS AND I N OTHER STATEMENTS WHICH W E HAVE
 MADE THAT WE DO FIND A NUMBER OF OPOINTS OF
 COMMON INTEREST AND I THINK THAT THAT IS THE
 IMPORTANT POINT.
 1:  COULD WE PERHAPS ELICIT A RESPONSE FROM YOU,
 S I R ,  O N HOW YOU WOULD CHARACTERIZE HUA K UD -FEN G
 AND TEND HSIAO-PING AS MEN WITH WHOM TO NEGOTIATE
 At  I HAVE MET VICE PREMIER TENG HSIAO-PING
 BE FO RE .  I HAD A VERY HIGH REGARD O F HIM AS A
 STATESMAN AND AS A LEADER FROM MY PREVIOUS TALKS,
 I  APPRECIATED VERY MUCH THE OPPORTUNITY TO  MEET
 WITH HIM  AGAIN.  MY TALKS GAIN THIS TIME
 CONFIRMED MY PREVIOUS VIEWS THAT HE IS A STATESMAN
 AND A LEADER OF STATURE,  I WAS PRIVILIGED
 TODAY TO MEET WITH HUA KUOFFENG.  HE IS MOST
 CERTAINLY A STATESMAN AND A DISTINGUISHED LEADER OF
 HIS NATION.
 Qe  MY QUESTION WAS, SIR, AS TO WHETHER OR NOT YOU
 CAN APPRAISE THEM AS NEGOTIATORS.
 A:  I  THINK THAT MIGHT BE PRESUMPTUOUS OF ME.
 0: MR,  SECRETARY, HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE
 BEFORE THE R E M A I N I N G I ,OOO O R SO  AMERICAN TROOPS
 ARE PULLED OUT OF TAIWAN.
 At  I DO NOT WISH, TO GET INTO SPECIFICS ON ANY OF
 THOSE KINDS OF QUESTIONS .
 0:  MR. SECREARY, DID YOU ACTUALLY DISCUSS THE
 MECHANICS OF NORMALISATION IN ALL THESE TALKS?
 A:  WE DISCUSSED NORMALIZATION AND THE DETAILS OF
 NORMAL IRAT10N.

 0: COULD YOU GIVE US SOME IDEA OF THE NATURE
 OF YOUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE CHINESE ON THE SUBJECT
 OF THE SOVIET UNION?
 A:  ONE OF THE SUBJECTS WHICH WE DISCUSSED WAS
 THE SOVIET U N I ON ,  BUT LET ME REPEAT WHAT I
 HAVE SAID MANY TIMES;  NAMELY,  THAT  OUR RELATIONSHIP
 WITH THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA IS ONE OF THE
 CENTRAL ELEMENTS OF OUR FOREIGN POLICY, BUT THAT
 IS NO WAY JEOPAREIDES ANY THIRD COUNTRY.  I HAVE
 SAID THAT REPEATEDLY AND I SAY IT AGAIN.
 0:  DID YOU REACH AGRREEMENT,OR NEAR AGREEMENT
 ON ANY OF THE LESSER ISSUES, BILATERAL ISSUES,
 LIKE EXCHANGES,  TRADE,  ASSETS, OR OTHER SUCH ITEMS?
 A:  WE WERE INVOLVED IN EXPLORATORY TALKS AND WE
 DISCUSSED THOSE KINDS OF  ISSUES WHICH YOU HAVE
 MENTIONED.  THIS WAS BUT THE FIRST TALK BETWEEN
 OUR WO  GOVERNMENTS AND TALKS WILL CONTINUE IN
 THE FUTURE.
 0: DO YOU THINK THOSE OTHER ISSUES INCLUDING ASSETS
 AND CLAIMS WILL HAVE TO AWAIT SETTLEMENT UNTIL THE
 TAIWAN QUESTION IS SETTLED?
 A:  I  DON 'T KNOW.
 0:  MR.  SECRETARY, THE PRESIDENT SAID A COUPLE OF
 WEEKS AGO THAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT
 RELATIONS COULD BE NORMALISED WITH THE PEOPLE'S
 REPUBLIC BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR? DO YOU THINK
 AFTER FOUR DAYS OF  A LK S THAT  I S STILL A POSSIBLE
 AND REALISTIC HOPE?

 0:  ONE OF THE TOASTS TONIGHT By THE CHINESE FOREIGN
 MINISTER TALKED ABOUT HOW OUR TWO COUNTRIES FACED
 QUESTIONS OF COMMON CONCERN AND WE HAD QUITE A
 FEW POINTS IN COMMON. TELL ME, SIR, COULD YOU
 ITEMISE SOME OF THESE POINTS?
 AS  AGAIN, MR.  KALB,  I HAVE SAID REPEATEDLY THAT
 I DO NOT WISH TO GO INTO DETAIL,  I THINK IT
 IS  INAPPROPRIATE TO GO  INTO DETAIL.
 0:  DID YOU FIND THE THRUST AND STYLE OF MR.  TENG'S
 REMARKS THIS TIME REMINISCENT OF YOUR CONVERSATIONS
 WITH HIM TWO YEARS AGO?
 A.  I FOUND HIM BEFORE AND I FOUND HIM THIS TIME
 INCISIVE,  THOUGHTFUL,  ARTICULATE,  AND I
 DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS VIEW DEVELOPED LAST TIME THAT
 WE HAD AN ACRIMONIOUS EXCHANGE.  HE AND  I WERE TALKING
 ABOUT THAT  IN OUR MEETING YESTERDAY.  NEITHER OF
 US RECALL ANY SUCH ACRIMONIOUS EXCHANGE. WE HAD
 A DIFFERENCE OF VIEWPOINT ON ONE OF TWO POINTS
 BUT THEY WEREN'T EXPRESSED  IN ANY ACRIMONIOUS
 FASHION.  THEY WERE CONDUCTED IN A FRIENDLY AND
 CORDIAL TMOSPHERE.
 o:  WHAT  IS THE BENEFIT OF HEARING  IT FROM
 THE CHINESE FIRSTHAND?  IS THERE ANYTHING YOU.
 KNOW NOW THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHEN YOU CAME FROM
 WASHINGTON?
 A:  YES,  INDEED.  I THINK IT  IS ALWAYS  ADVANTAGEOUS
 TO SIT DOWN FIRST HAND, PARTICULARLY WITH THE
 LEADERS OF A COUNTRY AND TO HAVE A CHANCE TO LAY

 TIME YOU LEFT WASHINGTON AND NOW?
 A:  AGAIN,  I DO NOT WISH TO COMMENT ON
 BEHALF OF THE CHINESE.
 0:  MR. SECRETARY, HAVE THE CHINESE GIVEN YOU THE
 CONDITIONS FOR NORMALISING RELATIONS?
 A : THE CHINESE POSITION ON A NUMBER OF THE
 MATTERS RELATING TO  TAIWAN HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED
 PUBLICLY AND I THINK THAT IT WOLD BE BEST IF
 I LEFT  IT THAT WAY.
 0:  WERE THERE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS MADE FOR SOLVING
 OF SOME OF THE LESSER ISSUES, SUCH AS ASSETS,
 CULTURAL EXCHANGE?
 A.  THERE WAS A FULLDISCUSSION OF THESE ISSUES.
 THERE HAVE BEEN PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS ON A NUMBER
 OF THESE ISSUES BEFORE AND WHAT WE WERE DOING IN
 THIS PARTICULAR AREAS,  SUCH AS CULTURAL ExCHANGES,
 TRADE AND THOSE KINDS OF MATTERS WAS TO BACK UP
 AND CARRY ON FROM A SPECIFIC SITUATION.
 0:  COULD  I FOLLOW UP WITH  TWO POINTS:  1) DID YOU
 BRING UP THE SUBJECT OF THE CHINESE JAMMING THE
 VOICE OF AMERICA.
 A:  NO, THAT SPECIFIC ISSUE DID NOT ARISE.
 C:  IF NOT,  WHY NOT?  IS IT NOT SOMETHING THAT WOULD
 IMPROVE RELATIONS FROM A U.S. POINT OF VIEW?
 A:  WE WILL BE HAVING FURTHER DISCUSSION IN THE
 FUTURE.         WE HAVE ONLY SO  MUCH TIME.
 Q:  SECOND POINT,  DID YOU AND AT WHAT LEVEL BRING
 UP THE SUBJECT  OF HUMAN RIGHTS?
 A:  YES I DID.  IN DISCUSSING OUR FOREIGN
 POLICY,  OBVIOUSLY I DISCUSSED HUMAN RIGHTS BECAUSE
 IT  IS ONE  OF  THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS  IN OUR FOREIGN
 POLICY AND   I  LAID OUT  OUR VIEW ON THIS AND  I
 HOPE CLARIFIED I T.  -
 Q:  DID THE CHINESE RESPOND TO YOUR VIEWS ON
 HUMAN RIGHTS?
 A:  I HAVE DISCUSSED IT WITH THEM OVER AND ABOVE
 MY  OWN STATEMENT,
 0:  AT WHAT LEVEL WAS THAT?  WAS  IT JUST AT
 FOREIGN MINISTER LEVEL OR  ...

 THP INTERNATIONAL SPHERE,         A CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE,
 HAS CHANGED AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE
 PR EP AR E'D T O SUPPORT A CONSTRUCTIVE 'ROLE BY THE
 UNITED STATES IN INTERNATIONAL TRENDS.
 Q:   MR.  SECRETARY, WOULD YOU SAY IN THE MOST
 GENERAL TERMS THAT YOU ARE GOING AWAY FROM HERE
 MORE CONFIDENT OF BEING ABLE TO NORMALIZE RELATIONS
 OR MERELY GETTER INFORMED ON THE -DIFFICULTIES?
 A:   I  WOULD SAY THAT I GD AWAY FROM HERE BETTER
 INFORMED, CERTAINLY THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.
 I THINK THAT AS I LEAVE HERE THAT THE LEADERS
 OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC PROBABLY NOW HAVE A
 BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE VIEWS OF OUR GOVERNMENT
 AND THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES ON THESE ISSUES
 AND  I  HOPE  AND BELIEVE THAT AS A PART OF THAT
 PROCESS THAT WE ARE BOTH MORE UNDERSTANDING AND
 THUS ARE IN A POSITION WHERE WE HAVE A BETTER
 GRASP OF THE PROBLEMS OF NORMALIZATION. WE BOTH
 HAVE STATED THAT WE BELIEVE IT IS  IN THE INTERESTS
 OF OUR TWO COUNTRIES TO PROCEED TOWARD
 NORMALISATION.  THAT HAS BEEN THE STATED GOAL
 OF OUR COUNTRY.  IT HAS BEEN STATED BY THE
 PRESIDENT AND BY ME AND IT REMAINS OUR POSITION.
 Q :   WHEN YOU CAME TO T H I S SERIES O F MEETINGS YOU
 HAD IN YOUR MIND SOME QUESTION ABOUT HOW THE
 PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC MIGHT REACT TO  CERTAIN AMERICAN
 INITIATIVES IN THE NORMALIZATION PROCESS.  WITHOUT
 INTRUDING ON THE SUBSTANCE OF WHATEVER ANSWERS
 YOU HAVE RECEIVED;, DO YOU LEAVE PEKING WITH THE
 NOTION THAT YOU NOW DO UNDERSTAND THE POSITION
 OF THIS GOVERNMENT ON THIS QUESTION.
 As   I BELIEVE I DO.
 Q:   MR.  SECRETARY,  A TECHNICAL QUESTION,  WHY  IS
 THERE NO COMMUNIQUE AT THE END OF THIS MEETING?
 All  THE REASON IS VERY SIMPLE ONE.  WE TALKED
 IT OVER.  WE DECIDED THAT INASMUCH AS THIS WAS
 AND EXPLORATORY MEETING THERE WAS NO NEED FOR A
 COMMUNIQUE AT THIS TIME.  THERE HAD BEEN PREVIOUS

 INDICATIONS OF FLEXIBILITY IN YOUR PRIVATE TALKS

 A: IN ASIA?
 Q:   YES

 A:   WE HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT ALL  OF  THE  VARIOUS
