 CHINA
 4--
 in two dramatic and apparently related
 moves, Hua Kuo-feng has succeeded Mao
 Tse-tung as chairman of the Chinese
 Communist Party and of the powerful
 Military Commission, while the Polit-
 buro's four leading leftists have report-
 edly been arrested. Public announce-
 ment of these changes-and perhaps
 others-is likely only at the conclusion
 of a Central Committee meeting that is
 apparently in session.
 Hua's rapid promotion, a month after
 Mao's death, was probably made possible
 by a coalition of centrist and rightist
 civilians with the support of the military.
 The military may try to extract rewards
 for its support, and there is potential for
 friction between civilians and some
 military leaders.
 In addition to ratifying Hua's promo-
 tion, the Central Committee is probably
 reviewing the charges against the four lef-
 tists, one of whom is Mao's widow Chiang
 Ching. These people are widely disliked
 and, if the party looks back to the leftist-
 inspired purges of the cultural revolution
 a decade ago, the list of their "crimes" is
 likely to be long. Thus far, they have
 reportedly been accused of plotting a
 coup, presumably against Hua, and of dis-
 torting Mao's writings.
 There are rumors that several dozen
 supporters of the leftists have also been
 arrested. These are said to include Mao's
 nephew, who apparently was in charge of
 Mao's personal secretariat just before his
 death, and the minister of culture, a
 protege of Mao's widow.
 The Central Committee may also be
 considering the case of Politburo member
 Li Te-sheng, the only regional military
 commander who has espoused leftist
 causes since the fall of Teng Hsiao-ping.
 Li could be in serious trouble, but his case
 is probably a delicate one because he has
 troops at his command.
 The Central Committee may also be
 trying to reconstitute the Politburo,
 depleted by deaths and purges. Among its
 decisions could be the appointment of a
 new premier should Hua relinquish that
 job, which seems likely. Rightist Polit-
 buro member Li Hsien-nien, a vice
 premier, is the most logical choice if leftist
 First Vice Premier Chang Chun-chiao has
 indeed fallen. Li was eclipsed by Chang
 for most of the year but has been very
 prominent in the past week.
 Chang and the other leftists have not
 appeared in public since late last month.
 Their purge would leave the rightists with
 more power than they have had in over a
 decade and would remove a major source
 of contention in the leadership.
 25X1
 THAILAND    Z
 Bangkok has remained quiet since the
 armed forces overthrew the constitutional
 government on October 6. The military's
 newly formed National Administrative
 Reform Council, led by Admiral Sa-ngat,
 is in effective control as new government
 institutions are being developed.
 The abrupt dismissal from active ser-
 vice on October 9 of General Chalat, a
 former deputy army commander attached
 to the Ministry of Defense, was meant to
 warn senior officers outside the Coun-
 cil-as well as subordinate troop com-
 manders-of the hazards of joining any
 countercoup attempt.
 Admiral Sa-ngat has been concerned
 about the intentions of leaders of the now
 banned Thai Nation Party-and their
 associates in the military such as General
 Chalat-who have been removed from
 positions of power. None of these figures
 commands troops, and chances of a
 countercoup are poor.
 There are simmering problems within
 the Council. Its expansion to include
 several more army officers has soothed
 the army's initial disgruntlement over its
 limited representation.
 Admiral Sa-ngat apparently hopes that
 the rapid formation of a civilian caretaker
 administration will defuse the growing
 ambitions of some military officers for a
 greater  political  role.  Thanin
 Kraiwichian, a Supreme Court justice
 known for conservative but not extreme
 right-wing views, was appointed prime
 minister on October 8, and a cabinet is
 likely to be selected shortly. Sa-ngat is
 also planning to accelerate the appoint-
 ment of a national assembly-a un-
 icameral  body  with  virtually  no
 power-and hopes to complete the entire
 process by the end of October.
 It is not clear how much latitude will be
 permitted the civilian cabinet. When a
 civilian administration is in place, the
 Council intends to disband, but a smaller
 residual military committee will continue
 to give policy guidance to the prime
 minister. There are plans, moreover, to
 appoint a military man-perhaps
 retired-as deputy prime minister.
 Military leaders are willing, for the mo-
 ment, to operate behind a civilian facade,
 but they do not want to relinquish com-
 plete control of the government to
 civilians-no matter how conser-
 vative-and have already given notice
 that they would again step in should the
 civilians falter.                   25X1

 Syria's terms for a cease-fire.
 Negotiations last weekend in Syrian-

 Arafat's removal from the chairmanship
 of  the  Palestine  Liberation
 Organization-a step they apparently
 believe necessary to guarantee the future
 tractability of the movement.
 The Syrians launched;their offensive in
 south Lebanon on October 12. Starting
 from their positions in Jazzin, Syrian un-
 its pushed westward toward the port of
 Sidon, the major entry point of supplies
 for Palestinian and leftist forces. The
 Syrians quickly took Rum, the
 Palestinians' regional headquarters and
 the last major stronghold on the Sidon
 road, as well as a number of neighboring
 villages.
 Syrian forces also pushed south from
 Jazzin toward key Palestinian positions at
 Nabatiyah and Marj Uyun; by October
 13 they had reached Saydun and Kafr
 Hunah. It is not clear how far south the
 Syrians are prepared to go. They are
 steadily narrowing the gap between their
 positions and the Israeli border and are
 presumably wary of triggering any overt
 Israeli reaction.
 The Israeli government, however,
 probably welcomes the new Syrian offen-
 sive as a further blow to Palestinian-leftist
 prospects in Lebanon that will aid Israel's
 own efforts to eliminate fedayeen units
 from the border area. The Israelis have
 been providing Christian forces near the
 border with tactical guidance and limited
 military aid, including small arms, am-
 munition, and training.
 In the mountains east of Beirut, inten-
 sive Syrian shelling of Palestinian and lef-
 tist positions in Bhamdun and Alayh on
 October 13 permitted Syrian troops to
 enter Bhamdun by the next morning. The
 Syrians are probably planning to combine
 pressure on Beirut's eastern approaches
 with the interdiction of the coastal road
 between Beirut and Sidon, thus choking
 off sources of supply for Palestinians and
 leftists in Muslim-held west Beirut.
 Syria announced this week that it
 would attend the Arab summit conference
 scheduled to begin October 18 in Cairo,

 tion of an interim government to prepare
 Rhodesia for independence under black
 majority rule. Preliminary talks are
 scheduled to start on October 21. The
 blacks, despite more negative-sounding
 declarations, are apparently preparing to
 attend.
 On the African side, the invitations
 went to Joshua Nkomo and Robert
 Mugabe, as spokesmen for the two fac-
 tions that have guerrillas in the field, and
 to Bishop Muzorewa, whose faction has
 no guerrilla wing but has demonstrated
 political support in Rhodesia. At least
 some of the five "front-line" African
 states that have been pressing for a
 Rhodesian solution-Tanzania, Zambia,
 Mozambique,  Botswana,  and
 Angola-and South Africa are likely to
 send observers.
 The British named their envoy to the
 UN, Ivor Richards, to be chairman of the
 nounced they had formed a "patriotic
 front" to negotiate for the "total and im-
 mediate" transfer of power. Their alliance
 is almost certainly a temporary one aimed
 largely at strengthening their political
 position at the expense of Muzorewa.
 The statement also called for a delay in
 the start of the conference-which Britain
 apparently has resisted-and set forth a
 series of harsh demands that Nkomo and
 Mugabe said were essential to create the
 proper atmosphere for talks. They
 stopped short, however, of making fulfill-
 ment of the demands a precondition to
 their attendance at Geneva. Nkomo an-
 nounced this week that he has formed
 an 18-member delegation.
 For his part, Ian Smith is taking to
 Geneva a delegation including both
 moderate whites and hard liners. Smith
 has stated he is coming to the conference
 prepared to negotiate only within the
 framework of the "package" that he
 publicly accepted on September 24. On
 this point, he has received strong backing
 from South Africa's Prime Minister
 Vorster.

 be control over the Rhodesian security
 forces. All the nationalist factions appear
 prepared to hold out against continued
 white control over these forces during a
 transition period. The whites seem equally
 determined not to yield on the issue.
 Although  most  Rhodesian  whites
 appear to have accepted the prospect of
 black rule within two years, they are keep-

 Large numbers of whites would probably
 decide to go if the blacks gain early con-

 widespread violence by black guerrilla

 ANGOLA 1
 3:0.
 The USSR gave an enthusiastic
 welcome to Angolan President Agostinho
 Neto last week during the African leader's
 first trip to the Soviet Union since the es-
 tablishment of his government. The visit
 was highlighted by the signing of a
 20-year friendship and cooperation treaty.
 The victory of Neto's Popular Move-
 ment in Angola's civil war was one of
 Moscow's most visible foreign policy
 successes in the past few years. By further
 cementing their ties with Neto, who
 recently joined the ranks of the
 "front-line" black African leaders, l he
 Soviets hope to expand their influence in
 postwar Angola as well as among the
 southern African national liberationists,
 especially in Namibia.
 General Secretary Brezhnev, at a
 dinner in Neto's honor, underlined the
 Soviet Union's continuing support to the
 liberationists when he gave Moscow's
 most authoritative criticism of those who
 "are attempting to substitute a fictitious
 liberation... for a true one."
 The Soviet Union has concluded
 "friendship" treaties with only a few
 third-world countries-India, Egypt,
 Iraq, and Somalia. The text of the
 Angolan treaty resembles the format and
 substance of the other treaties, outlining a
 commitment to cooperate in a wide varie-
 ty of fields, including defense.
 The treaty provides for the strengthen-
 ing of military cooperation-implying
 continued Soviet military aid. Under this
 clause, the Soviets could try to gain access
 to military facilities in Angola, but we
 doubt Neto would agree.
 Neto's talks in Moscow apparently
 focused on party ties and the needs of
 Angola's economy. At the end of Neto's
 stay, the Soviets announced the signing of
 a cooperation agreement between the
 Popular Movement and the Soviet Com-
 munist Party as well as a protocol to an
 economic and technical cooperation
 agreement concluded during Prime
 Minister Nascimento's visit last May.
 The Angolans seem anxious to see the
 USSR play a greater role in their
 economic development, but Angola needs
 access to the West if it is to benefit fully
 from its 9il, agricultural, and mineral
 resources. .
 Neither side mentioned it, but Neto
 probably extended a personal invitation to
 his Soviet hosts to attend the first anniver-
 sary celebration of Angola's independence
 on November 11. Should a top Soviet
 leader attend, he would be the first
 high-ranking Soviet to visit a southern
 African  country. Military Operations 31-33
 The Neto government is carrying out
 military operations against National
 Union insurgents in southern Angola near
 the Namibian border. Government forces
 are being supported by Cubans and ap-
 parently also by some guerrillas of the
 South West Africa People's Organiza-
 tion.
 The operations sparked serious unrest
 late last month among the population on
 Approved For Release 2008/02/01: CIA-RDP79-00927A011400170001-9
 the Angolan side of the border between
 Calueque and Pereira de Eca.
 The Angolans, however, disputed news
 stories in the South African media in-
 dicating that the operations have resulted
 in widespread killing of innocent persons.
 The South African government con-
 firmed in late September that construc-
 tion has been suspended at two key
 points-Calueque and Ruacana-of the
 joint Angolan - South African Cunene
 hydroelectric project. Work at Calueque
 was halted at the request of the Angolan
 government.                   ,
 The Angolan-Namibian border area is
 likely to become the scene of increasing
 military activity in the months ahead. The
 Neto regime is anxious to extend its
 authority to the border and, with Cuban
 help, has established a number of gar-
 risons in the area.
 SWAPO would like to step up its incur-
 sions into Namibia from Angola, es-
 pecially now that South Africa's control
 over the territory is attracting inter-
 national attention. Until recently,
 SWAPO conducted its limited guerrilla
 operations mainly from Zambia.

 None of the government leaders ap-
 pointed by Prime Minister Thorbjorn
 Falldin last week has ever held a cabinet
 post before, but most have served in
 responsible positions in the federal
 bureaucracy. Initial policy declarations
 by the new government stress continuity
 in Swedish foreign and domestic policy.
 Falldin's own Center Party received
 eight portfolios, the Conservative Party
 six, and the Liberal Party five. Liberal
 46-5,O
 Party leader Per Ahlmark was named to
 the newly created post of deputy prime
 minister, as well as labor minister. The
 Conservative leader, Goesta Bohman, was
 made minister of economy, one of the two
 posts created by splitting the finance
 ministry.
 For the first time, Sweden has a woman
 foreign minister, Karin Soeder. She has
 been the second deputy chairman of the
 Center Party since 1971 and has served on
 the Foreign Relations Committee in
 parliament, the Council of Europe, and on
 the Swedish Foreign Relations Council,
 an advisory body to the prime minister.
 Falldin's most innovative steps may be
 in the nuclear energy field. He created a
 new cabinet post to coordinate energy
 policy and intends to appoint a special
 commission to study the security and en-
 vironmental ramifications of nuclear
 power. The commission will present its
 report to Parliament in 1978, and the
 government will "consider" a referendum
 on further nuclear expansion at that time.
 ,SS NATO: European Program Group Meets
 The arms directors of the European
 Program Group-which consists of the
 ten European members of NATO plus
 France-held their third meeting in Rome
 recently. The purpose of the meeting was
 to review progress made on European
 arms collaboration and to prepare for a
 meeting of the Group to be held in late
 November at the political level.
 Review of work accomplished thus far
 focused on progress made in developing
 opportunities for cooperation in present
 national equipment schedules and future
 equipment  needs.  The representatives
 concluded that the overall progress so far
 was satisfactory and agreed to establish
 new areas for future cooperation.
 The representatives also appeared
 satisfied with the work of a subgroup
 charged with developing political and in-
 dustrial principles to guide European
 arms cooperation. A full assessment of
 the work of this politically oriented group
 was reserved for the November meeting.

 The Europeans attach considerable im-
 portance to the November meeting. An
 Italian official said recently that the
 meeting will specifically address the ques-
 tion of a formal tie to NATO.
 Since the formation of the Group,
 the Europeans have given first priority to
 achieving arms standardization among
 themselves. A formal tie with NATO
 would help lay the groundwork for later
 implementation of a "two-way street"
 in the arms trade with the US.
 The first tentative approaches may in
 fact have already been made. At a

 and the three major European
 powers-France, the UK, and West Ger-

 Sweden's foreign policy is to remain
 relatively unchanged-nonalignment in
 peacetime and neutrality in war. Aid to
 Cuba will be reduced further, and support
 for the liberation movements in southern
 Africa will be increased. The new govern-

 PANAMA
 25X1
 The relatively tame, pro forma obser-
 vance on October 11 of the anniversary of
 the coup that brought strongman Omar
 Torrijos to power in 1968 gave
 Panamanians little to cheer about. Torri-
 jos' speech, centering on the discouraging
 economic outlook, reflected the fact that
 his "revolution" is on the defensive.
 The Panamanian leader's opening
 assertion that the massive crowd refuted
 the contention that the revolution is losing
 support does not stand up to scrutiny. The
 gathering of 20,000 people-many of
 whom were government employees of-
 ficially encouraged to attend-was far
 below official targets.
 Following the student-led protests
 against price increases last month, the
 controlled press only belatedly promoted
 the anniversary.  General Torrijos'
 appearance was greeted with apathy, and
 the mood of the crowd, like the tenor of
 the speeches, was generally uninspired.
 The loudest cheers came when Torrijos
 announced a holiday the following day.
 Torrijos admitted to a difficult
 economic situation, but offered few
 specific solutions. He enumerated such
 urban ills as increased unemployment, the
 rising cost of living, and poor transporta-
 tion. He did promise an emergency
 national public works program, but ad-
 mitted that an unemployment survey had
 yet to be started, suggesting that much
 remains to be done before an effective
 program is implemented.
 The Panamanian leader came close to
 announcing two measures that are certain
 to add to discontent. Asking for sacrifice,
 he said new tax measures "must be
 taken." He also stated that some articles
 in the labor code must be changed. He
 was referring to articles popular with the
 workers that are hurting business. Despite
 his 'effort to pave the way for these
 measures, labor unions especially will be
 disgruntled at the loss of any prerogatives.
 The General's swipes at the US were, in
 the Panamanian context, almost perfunc-
 tory. Torrijos did not set any deadlines in
 the canal negotiations nor repeat past
 Panamanian demands for an end to the
 US presence before the year 2000. He
 even noted that rash actions could cost
 Panama support in the hemisphere.
 PERU  ~Z - 7 ~
 Peruvian President Morales Bermudez
 failed on October 3 to deliver the
 customary "Revolution Day" address; he
 was to have outlined some important
 future government policies.
 No explanation was given for the break
 with tradition, but
 government leaders could not agree
 on one major aspect of policy-a more
 restrictive labor law. Since the law would
 reportedly limit strikes and give manage-
 ment greater latitude in dismissals, it
 would surely have evoked labor protests
 that could have catalyzed discontent
 throughout the country.
 The government hopes to avoid an-
 other outbreak of disorder. Popular back-
 ing for the President seems weak and his
 support within the armed forces is uncer-
 tain. The government, therefore, has be-
 come increasingly sensitive to growing
 domestic criticism of its recent policies;
 leftist opponents charge that the gov-
 ernment has betrayed the revolution.
 Many civilians are calling for the
 restoration of civil liberties that were
 suspended by a state of emergency decree
 imposed in part to prevent labor protests.
 The regime is trying to demonstrate the
 need to continue the state of emergency
 by giving dramatic billing to the recent
 arrest of 17 members of a far-left terrorist
 group, the Peruvian Popular Army. The
 opposition has not yet responded to the
 government's ar ument but will Probably
 not be satisfied.

 a regional army corps commander, is
 almost sure to get the new job.
 The planning minister will coordinate
 the activities of all the other ministries.
 One purpose is to centralize President
 Videla's authority over the government.
 Videla has been criticized by some in the

 and for permitting government policy to

 Videla and others may also judge that it
 is time to devote increased attention to
 other important issues in addition to

 of his day-to-day responsibility as arm
 commander in chief.
 changes in regiona  corps
 commanders may be forthcoming in the

 The unprecedented powers assumed by the executive
 branch under Prime Minister Gandhi will be institutionalized
 this fall when Parliament approves a constitutional amend-
 ment. Few Indians disapprove.
 India: Gandhi's Rule
 The increasingly authoritarian trend
 that has marked Prime Minister Indira
 Gandhi's decade in office will reach a new
 benchmark this fall when Parliament ap-
 proves, as it surely will, a constitutional
 amendment  to  institutionalize un-
 precedented power in the executive
 branch. Future challenges to Gandhi's
 authority from the courts and the
 presidency will be effectively neutralized.
 The most important provisions of the
 omnibus amendment will:
 ? Unequivocally establish the prime
 minister as the supreme authority in
 government.
 ? Institutionalize many repressive
 measures in effect since Gandhi im-
 posed a national emergency in June
 1975.
 ? Sharply  curtail the judiciary's
 power to challenge legislation and ex-
 ecutive actions and to safeguard civil
 liberties.
 Beyond this, the provisions give Gandhi
 carte blanche during the next two years to
 amend the constitution further under the
 pretext of removing "difficulties" that
 stand in the way of implementing the new
 amendment.
 The amendment stems from a com-
 mittee Gandhi appointed last February to
 draft proposals ostensibly aimed at mak-
 ing the constitution a "dynamic in-
 strument" of social and economic change.
 The amendment, however, goes con-
 siderably beyond the committee's
 recommendations, making it clear that
 Gandhi plans to retain all the vast power
 she has held on a temporary basis since
 imposing the emergency.
 Gandhi defends the amendment as a
 necessary updating of India's 26-year-old
 constitution. She says the present dis-
 tribution of power in the constitution,
 which mainly follows the British pattern,
 impedes economic and social reform by
 favoring the rich over the poor. In part,
 this argument provides a scapegoat for
 her administration's failure to improve
 substantially the living standards of In-
 dia's 630 million people.
 Gandhi's Leadership Style
 Gandhi's intolerance of criticism and
 her reluctance to compromise made it
 almost inevitable that her administration
 would  grow  progressively  more
 authoritarian. She has repeatedly sought
 full freedom of action. These traits were
 not visible in 1966 when Congress Party
 leaders, on the death of prime minister
 Shastri, chose Gandhi as his successor
 with the expectation that she would be
 malleable.
 Gandhi's initial uncertainty in office
 gave way within months to self-con-
 fidence, and by the end of 1969 Gandhi
 had outmaneuvered the veteran party
 leaders and gained control of the party.
 She was willing to take political gambles,
 and they usually paid off. By 1972 she had
 won a national election giving her a large
 parliamentary majority and had presided
 over  India's military victory over
 Pakistan in the war for Bangladesh's in-
 dependence.
 Setbacks and Threats
 Economic setbacks and political
 challenges in the following years helped
 nudge Gandhi toward authoritarian con-
 trol. The severe impact of two poor mon-
 soons and worldwide inflation made a
 mockery of her promise in the 1971 cam-
 paign to abolish poverty. Opposition par-
 ties joined to capitalize on mounting
 public discontent, and  in the early
 summer of 1975 Gandhi's opponents were
 planning a national civil disobedience
 campaign demanding her resignation.
 They were further encouraged by a court
 ruling that found Gandhi guilty of cam-
 paign violations and threatened her with
 dismissal from office.
 Gandhi responded resolutely to the
 threat, proclaiming a state of emergency
 on June 26, 1975. Asserting that she was
 acting to halt a threat to national security,
 Gandhi suspended civil liberties, jailed her
 opponents, and muzzled the press-un-
 precedented acts in India during
 peacetime.
 Revising the System
 In the early months of the emergency
 Gandhi reportedly considered adopting a
 strong presidential system, but dropped
 the idea when some of her close advisers
 opposed it. Instead, she opted for a
 redistribution of power within the existing
 parliamentary framework.
 One of Gandhi's major objectives has
 been to curb the judiciary. The courts,
 through their substantial review powers,
 have challenged a number of Gandhi's
 policies. She charges that the judiciary

 the loss of traditional democratic rights.
 Gandhi has used economic pressures and
 other threats to force the once-lively free
 press to conform and to abide by rules
 that restrict criticism of the government
 or exposure of problems that would em-
 barrass the government.
 Popularly elected state officials resent
 the central bureaucracy's powerful role
 under the emergency but are unable to
 prevent the growing concentration of
 power in the central government. The few
 opposition parties are divided and
 demoralized, with some of their leaders
 still in jail.
 India is not, however, a repressive dic-
 tatorship such as those in some third
 world countries. Tens of thousands of In-
 dians have been arrested for political and
 economic offenses since June 1975, but
 many were released after short jail terms.

 The Spanish government has responded

 pressures by announcing strong measures
 to attack inflation and by submitting to
 the Cortes a bill that would effectively
 legalize opposition trade unions.
 The Cortes battles over various reform
 bills this month may be decisive in the
 government's campaign to democratize
 the political system. In a final effort
 to force the government to back down,

 amendments that would cripple the bills.

 are ubiquitous, but no attempt has been
 made to transform them into a per-

 Prospects
 On the basis of her performance in the
 past, it seems unlikely that Gandhi will
 use her enhanced power to implement
 basic social and economic changes. She
 recently stated that reform in the coun-
 tryside must come from education and
 persuasion rather than force.
 Gandhi seems unwilling to face the
 serious political problems that would ac-

 quo through far-reaching policies aimed
 at redressing basic inequities in Indian
 society.

 National Council-the overseeing body
 of Franco's National Movement party.
 The Council's report is nonbinding but
 serves as a clear warning that the right
 will resist when the Cortes debates the
 bills later this month.
 The government still seems likely to
 win the required majority in the
 legislature, unless the military weighs in
 against the reforms-as apparently
 happened over the penal code reform
 bill-or the right is galvanized by a
 charismatic leader.
 The right does seem to be strengthening
 itself politically. Spanish officials have ex-
 pressed concern over the recent formation
 of a rightist alliance by former interior
 minister Fraga and six other former
 ministers who served under Franco.
 Although Fraga drafted the last
 government's reform program, he is con-
 sidered a rightist at heart. The new group,
 the Popular Alliance, also includes several
 diehard opponents of any political reform.
 Fraga, with his seemingly boundless
 drive, talent, and ambition, may be the
 man who can unify the right. His
 successful negotiations with his former
 enemies on the right have already caused
 alarm in the unorganized center of the
 Spanish political spectrum.
 Government concern over military sup-
 port was evident in the cabinet's decision
 to submit the draft law on trade unions to
 the Cortes. The military hierarchy has
 pledged support for the government's

 proclamation. The government's focus
 rather has been on implementing birth-
 control programs, curbing economic
 offenses such as smuggling and hoarding,
 cleaning up the cities, and improving
 government services.
 Gandhi delegates little authority. She
 consults with a small circle of relatives
 and aides, rather than with the cabinet,
 but she makes all important decisions
 herself. There is little opportunity for
 policy debate, open criticism, or in-
 novative ideas.
 As she faces each new challenge,
 Gandhi's sense of mission and self-
 righteousness seem to grow stronger. Her
 assumption of full responsibility for
 government performance and the cer-
 tainty of future economic crises when
 poor monsoons occur, could bode ill for
 Gandhi's future popularity and eventually
 force her to deal again with serious
 political instability.

 political reform program, though
 reportedly with the proviso that the
 reforms must be approved by the
 legislature. Prime Minister Suarez ap-
 parently met stiff resistance to his
 reported plan to bypass rightist
 dominated institutions by issuing decree
 laws to accomplish political reform.
 By handling the labor reform as normal
 legislation, the government risks having
 restrictions attached to it. In particular,
 the Cortes may find a way to exclude the
 Communist-dominated Workers Com-
 missions.  The government  reportedly
 wanted to allow the Communists to par-
 ticipate openly through their trade unions
 in Spain's political evolution in the hope
 that this would ease opposition pressure
 for legalization of the Communist Party.
 The major opposition trade unions have
 already condemned the government's ac-
 tion because it:
 ? Allows the rightist Cortes to sit in
 judgment on labor reforms.
 ? Reportedly sets up a registration
 procedure that will force the trade un-
 9RIVIVI~_

 ions to pass through the "government
 turnstiles" in order to be legalized.
 ? Delays legalization for at least a
 month.
 ? Does not completely eliminate the
 existing state-run labor organization.
 Economic Measures
 The opposition labor unions have also
 rejected the wide-ranging economic
 measures announced by the government
 on October 8, charging that the govern-
 ment was trying to make the workers bear
 the cost of ending the country's economic
 crisis. Labor may be mollified, however, if
 the government can hold the line on
 prices.
 Deputy Prime Minister Osorio an-
 nounced on October 8 the strongest
 measures yet taken by Spain to attack its
 serious inflation problem. Most Spanish
 officials blame inflation-now running at
 a 20-percent annual rate-for continued
 domestic economic stagnation and loss of
 competitiveness abroad.
 The new measures include a price freeze
 on goods and services for the rest of the
 SECRET
 year, followed by controlled price in-
 creases through September 1977. Spain
 will also institute strong wage controls ty-
 ing pay increases to the cost of living.
 These controls will extend through next
 June. A 20-percent import duty surcharge
 may also be imposed. The government
 decided to have the measures put into
 effect immediately by a royal decree to
 avoid normal legislative delays.
 While the wage controls are not new,
 their strict enforcement would be. Spain
 already has provisions limiting pay hikes
 to increases in the cost of living plus 3 per-
 cent, but some recent pay increases have
 been 30 percent. Osorio implied that the
 provision allowing the additional 3 per-
 cent over the cost of living might be
 dropped.
 To further assist firms in maintaining
 profitability during the price freeze,
 the government wants to hold dividend
 payments to 10 percent and has suspended
 the law preventing companies from firing
 unnecessary labor.
 The impact of these policies on the
 economy during the remainder of the year
 will be limited. Wage settlements during
 the fall labor negotiations will be restrain-
 ed by the measures, but beneficial! effects
 will not be felt fully until next year. Ex-
 port sales over the next few months will
 not show much, of an increase.
 Spain will probably still end 1976 with
 a 20-percent rise in prices for the year and
 a  $3-billion  current-account deficit.
 Moreover, the actual jobless rate,
 probably about 10 percent, will be little
 improved by any of the measures so far
 announced.
 The government made no mention of
 plans for fiscal and monetary restraints.
 It probably still wants to postpone a
 rigorous austerity program until after
 next summer's election.
 In setting its sights on improving con-
 ditions by next spring without a major
 overhaul of the economy, the government
 is likely to push for at least one more
 majoreconomic measure this year. A 15-
 to 20-percent depreciation of the peseta

 facto reductions have occurred as a result
 of inflation and the fall in the value of the
 pound from $2.40 in the spring of 1975 to
 the current rate of about $1.65.
 The rationale for the defense cutbacks
 does not flow from a new estimate of the
 Warsaw Pact. The UK still views NATO
 as the cornerstone of its security, and the
 Labor government promises to concen-
 trate its resources in the Alliance.
 The Labor government has tried to con-
 vince NATO that reductions to date have
 not harmed the UK's balanced air, sea,
 and land contribution to the Alliance.
 Britain's argument has been that the cuts
 affect only the tail and not the teeth of its
 military establishment. Britain is now in a
 situation, however, where any further
 economy measures are likely to cut into
 the UK contributions to NATO de-
 fense.
 Allies Worried
 In spite of economic problems and
 military cutbacks, the UK continues to
 provide most of NATO's maritime
 defense of the eastern Atlantic, the
 English Channel, and the supply and rein-
 forcement routes from North America.
 In addition, Britain has some 56,000
 ground troops and a number of tactical
 air force units assigned to the British
 Army of the Rhine. With its four Polaris
 submarines, Britain is the only European
 NATO ally contributing to the strategic
 nuclear deterrent forces,
 Britain's allies are concerned about
 possible future cuts in British defense
 spending, which currently runs at just un-
 der $10 billion annually. West Germany,
 for example, is worried about the UK's
 ability to maintain the British Army of
 the Rhine's current strength.
 The British are aware of the West Ger-
 man concern but appear unable to
 assuage the Germans. In fact, there are
 indications the UK may try to exploit
 German fears. Earlier this year then
 prime minister Wilson tried to negotiate a
 renewal  of the Anglo-German  offset
 arrangements by linking a generous Ger-
 man payment to the maintenance of
 British troop strength in West Germany.
 Recent Cuts
 The UK has announced two major
 defense cuts this year. In February it
 slashed spending through 1980 by over $1
 billion. The second cut, announced in Ju-
 ly, pared an additional $178 million from
 the 1977-1978 defense budget.
 The cuts came on top of the reductions
 announced in March 1975 following a
 major review of British defense policy by
 the Labor government. The goal of that
 review was to bring British defense expen-
 ditures more into line with those of
 France and West Germany, which spend
 about 3.5 to 4 percent of their gross
 national product on defense.
 The UK plans to reduce spending
 gradually from about 5.5 percent of the
 gross national product to about 4.5 per-
 cent by 1984. Comparatively, this decline
 will be aggravated by the rate of British
 economic growth, which continues to lag
 behind those of France and West Ger-
 many.
 The Callaghan government is under
 pressure from the Labor Party left wing to
 make even larger cuts in the defense
 budget.
 Debates in the cabinet over budget
 priorities will be difficult in face of the
 current economic problems, and the left
 wing may find allies among cabinet
 ministers intent on protecting their own
 budget allocations.
 New Defense Minister
 In the cabinet, Callaghan will miss
 former defense minister Roy Mason and
 his top deputy, William Rodgers, both of
 whom were moved to other posts in the re-
 cent cabinet shuffle. Although their
 replacements, Frederick Mulley and John
 Gilbert, are well disposed toward the
 military, they are not likely to be as effec-
 tive in public and private debate.
 Still, the new appointees will be able to
 handle the left. They can argue that ad-

 ditional cutbacks would increase the
 record unemployment rate. Mulley and
 Gilbert presumably will also remind the
 party that any British slippage in conven-
 tional or nuclear defense may cause the
 West Germans to fill the gap. The
 prospect of a strong Germany still
 troubles many Britons.
 The British have little room to save
 further on defense if they continue current
 policies. Over the longer term the UK
 may reduce defense costs through
 partnership  arrangements  on  major
 weapons development programs, but
 these projects offer little help now,
 The July reduction of $178 million, for
 example, was a purely political decision
 and, after the decision, senior defense of-
 ficials had to search for areas where cuts
 could be made. These officials had
 privately indicated before the July an-
 nouncement that there was no fat left in
 the defense budget and that any further
 reductions would have a direct effect on
 front line performance.
 Other British officials have told the
 Alliance the cumulative cuts have not
 damaged the UK contribution to NATO,
 although London's reluctance to consult
 with the Allies suggests there has been
 some impact. The Labor government ob-
 viously fears that NATO criticism would
 give the opposition Conservatives a
 weapon to use against the government in a
 future election campaign.
 If the Conservatives are returned to of-
 fice in the next election, however, their ef-
 forts to rebuild the defense budget would
 also be limited by Britain's economic
 situation.
 Possible Economy Moves
 Britain already has plans to abandon its
 peacetime military presence in the
 Mediterranean and to emphasize the
 defense of northern and central Europe.
 Elimination of the British military
 presence outside Europe would offer only
 marginal savings, Political obstacles
 could even prevent these small economies.
 Britain would probably not want to
 remove the small Hong Kong garrison,
 for instance, and the tense situation
 between Guatemala and the British
 GTS
 colony of Belize would be exacerbated by
 the withdrawal of British forces, which
 have been a stabilizing factor.
 Significant defense cuts will confront
 the UK with a choice between main-
 taining just a facade of balanced armed
 forces or moving toward a specialized
 contribution. Should the British shy away
 from such a decision, the overall quality
 of the UK's balanced force structure
 would be steadily eroded.
 In the event of a serious economic crisis
 and a subsequent urgent review of the
 defense budget, the following options
 would be high on the list of prospective
 cutbacks:
 ? Retiring Britain's only strategic
 bomber, the aging Vulcan B2, six
 squadrons of which are assigned to
 NATO.
 ? Mothballing the Royal Navy's
 two tiger-class cruisers and the UK's
 only remaining aircraft carrier, thus
 weakening NATO forces in the Atlan-
 tic.
 ? Building only two Invincible-class
 cruisers instead of the three now
 planned.
 ? Slashing civilian defense employ-
 ment beyond cuts already called for in
 the 1975 defense review and the 1976
 public expenditure review.
 Stretching out the acquisition period
 for the multirole Tornado aircraft is
 another  possible economy measure.
 Cancellation of this ambitious mul-
 tinational program is highly unlikely,
 since it would add thousands more to the
 unemployment rolls and undermine the
 production efforts of Britain's partners,
 West Germany and Italy.
 The allies would strongly oppose a
 sizable reduction in the British forces
 stationed on the Continent. Such a reduc-
 tion would in effect be a unilateral conces-
 sion at the mutual and balanced force
 reductions talks and further weaken
 NATO's already thin Northern Army
 Group. Before making such a decision,
 the UK will probably try to persuade
 West Germany to continue making sub-
 stantial offset payments.
 The UK could save money by aban-
 doning its ballistic missile submarines.
 The 1975 defense review hedged on this
 issue by prolonging the life of the Polaris

 missile force instead of replacing it with
 the more advanced Poseidon. This deci-
 sion put off the painful choice until the
 1980s, when age and technology will end
 the usefulness of the Polaris.
 Nuclear Debate
 A decision to abandon a strategic
 nuclear capability would not come easily
 to a British government, The capability
 provides the UK with membership in a
 still small international club in Europe
 and gives Britain equality with France and
 superiority over West Germany.
 If Britain can afford a new generation
 of weapons, the decisions it makes on
 weaponry will reveal whether it is
 prepared to end its heavy reliance on the
 US for nuclear hardware and technology
 and move toward collaboration with the
 French.
 Some Britons have renewed the push
 for Anglo-French nuclear cooperation.
 They argue that collaboration with
 France would establish an independent
 nuclear force for Western Europe. These
 proponents also point out that such
 cooperation would effectively combine
 British nuclear technology know-how and
 French delivery system expertise.
 President Marcos, while intent on retaining his
 authoritarian power, is preparing to create a semblance of pop-
 ular participation in government.
 ;~ (     Philippines: Another Referendum
 The referendum President Marcos has
 set for October 16 will allow him to go
 through the motions of re-establishing a
 legislative branch in his government
 without actually reducing his
 authoritarian powers.
 The public poll, the fourth since martial
 law was imposed four years ago, will ask
 Philippine voters whether martial law
 should be continued and whether a par-
 tially elected legislature should be created.
 Marcos expects a strongly favorable
 response to each question.
 The new legislature would be firmly un-
 der the control of the executive, who
 would determine what subjects it could
 discuss and how long it could remain in
 session.
 Marcos obviously is contriving to por-
 tray himself as responsive to public
 opinion. He is counting on the hand-
 picked local councils set up under martial
 law to guide the voters into giving him
 the same strong mandate for martial law
 that he received in the three previous
 referendums.
 Most Filipinos are apparently in-
 different if not content with martial law.
 They tend to look back on the old
 free-wheeling political system as corrupt
 and serving only the privileged. The
 reduction of violence that has resulted
 from martial law means more to them
 than their loss of political rights.
 The effort being made by some
 members of the clergy and former
 politicians to promote a boycott of the
 referendum will probably have little effect
 outside politically conscious Manila.
 Local government councils appear to have
 sufficient power to get out the vote and to
 alter the results should they fall short of
 overwhelming endorsement.
 Regime Strengths
 Marcos has no significant challengers.
 Armed forces of 140,000, led by key sup-
 porters, are the backbone for his rule. The
 40,000-man constabulary provides a per-
 vasive government presence.
 Former political opponents are cowed,
 jailed, or in exile. Former senator Aquino,
 who many think would have won the
 suspended  1973 election, has been in
 prison since martial law was declared in
 1972. He is now on trial for subversion.
 The Philippine press is guided and
 docile. There has been no need for harsh
 censorship because surviving newspapers
 are without exception owned by close
 friends or relatives of the first family.
 Marcos is sufficiently confident to per-
 mit a degree of moderate criticism. A
 number of respected figures occasionally
 speak out against the government. An-
 tigovernment activists are fitfully visible
 in labor and student circles. Some of these
 individuals have communist connections,
 but more are inspired by the Catholic
 Church.
 The church, although basically cautious
 and conservative, harbors some vigorous
 critics of the regime and is the only signifi-
 cant legal institutional base for opposition
 to the government. Marcos is alert to the
 potential danger; at least 83 percent of the
 people are nominally Catholic. Marcos
 frequently warns against the danger of the
 "Christian left" and has served notice on
 activist priests that excessive agitation
 would be met by increased intimidation.
 As Marcos likes to remind his coun-
 trymen, his regime can point to some
 achievements that the discarded political
 system failed to produce. The country has
 an unaccustomed sense of civil order, and
 the government has kept its communist
 insurgency in check. The Muslim in-
 surgency in the south has, little national
 political impact.

 The estimated 1,600 regulars of the
 New People's Army, the military arm of
 the outlawed pro-Chinese communist par-
 ty, have been generally contained and re-
 main basically a police problem. Key
 leaders were recently captured by govern-
 ment forces.
 The government can also take credit for
 such programs as land reform--limited in
 scope but nevertheless considerably more
 far reaching than earlier attempts-ex-
 panded credit to farmers, tax reform, and
 rural electrification. Although Filipinos
 have been disturbed over inflation, the
 government in recent months has been
 able to trim the inflation rate as inter-
 national trade and financial conditions
 have improved.
 Even  though  the  government's
 achievements are generally recognized,
 there is widespread annoyance, especially
 among the middle class, about the visible
 accumulation of great wealth by the Presi-
 dent and Mrs. Marcos. There is some
 general dissatisfaction with the indefinite
 continuation of the theoretically tem-
 porary martial law, but critics are neither
 willing nor able to challenge the regime.
 Marcos believes a guided vote of con-
 fidence will undercut his critics. The
 criticism is increasing, and the President
 has been sensitive to demands by
 churchmen and former politicians for a
 return to constitutional government.
 International press play on the mistreat-
 ment of political prisoners tends to under-
 cut his image of "smiling" martial law,
 and he worries about the effects abroad of
 such criticism, particularly the possibility
 that the US Congress might balk at
 further aid.
 Nominal Democracy
 Against this background, Marcos is
 attempting to devise a system of nominal
 popular participation in a government
 system of easily manipulated assemblies
 at the local and national levels.
 The local governmental mechanism
 which has been in place since the first of
 the year, has worked fairly well from the
 President's point of view. Marcos still
 seems uncertain, however, about how to
 structure a national legislature that would
 provide the same image of legitimacy yet
 not dilute his authority. He has been
 vague about its composition, although it
 would apparently include his hand-picked
 cabinet members. He has also said the
 timing of elections will depend on "how
 things develop."
 Last month,  Marcos appointed a
 legislative advisory council, composed of
 his own cabinet members and hand-
 picked members of village councils. The
 first session of the council showed it to be
 a totally controlled forum. Although the
 President has explained that the council is
 an interim body and not a substitute
 legislature, he probably sees it as a rough
 model for an eventual national legislature.
 Marcos holds a trump card should the
 referendum vote fail to meet his expec-
 tations or should any new assembly
 become too independent. He warns that if
 the election process shows signs of dis-
 honesty, he will revert to a "crisis
 government."

 Despite a prospective bumper grain harvest, we expect the
 Soviets to buy about 14 million tons of foreign grain this year,
 nearly 11 million tons of it from the US.
 USSR: Grain Outlook  25X1
 Prospects remain good for a bumper
 grain harvest in the USSR, although
 various methods of predicting the crop
 and the range of Soviet statements still
 leave room for a fairly wide span of
 possibilities.
 Our current estimate of Soviet grain
 production, based on all-source informa-
 tion on weather and crop conditions, is
 205 million metric tons, up 5 million tons
 from our early September estimate. The
 US Department of Agriculture puts the
 Soviet crop at 215 million tons.
 With a grain crop of 205 million tons,
 plus expected imports, the Soviets' grain
 supplies will be sufficient to maintain
 their momentum in rebuilding the
 livestock sector, improve the quality of
 bread and other consumer products, and
 start restocking depleted grain reserves.
 Predictions by Soviet officials of this
 year's harvest range from 195 million tons
 to a new record that would exceed the
 1973 crop of 222.5 million tons.
 In late August, Soviet Minister of
 Agriculture Mesyats indicated that the
 grain harvest would be over 200 million
 tons. In mid-September, another ministry
 official, in a conversation with the US
 agricultural attache in Moscow, said that
 the harvest should be "more than 200
 million tons, but we must see how much
 more." He then backtracked to say "it
 could also be around 195 million tons."
 General Secretary Brezhnev told Am-
 bassador Harriman on September 22 that
 "the 1976 grain harvest is expected to be
 even better than in 1973, which was a
 record year." On October 5, Brezhnev
 predicted to a French TV interviewer that
 the USSR would enjoy "a very good
 harvest of grain crops."
 Numerous Soviet regional yield and
 production figures have appeared in the
 Soviet press, covering an area of ap-
 proximately 61 million hectares, or 47
 percent of the area sown to grain. In many
 instances these yields exceed those incor-
 porated in our estimate.
 SECRET
 Grain Purchases
 We still believe that the USSR this year
 will purchase abroad about 14 million
 tons, a little more than half the amount
 bought in 1975. This would cost roughly
 $2 to $2.5 billion, compared with the
 nearly $4 billion spent for last year's
 purchases. So far this year, the USSR has
 bought 12.8 million tons of grain-6
 million tons of wheat, and 6.8 million tons
 of feedgrain-and 2 million tons of soy-
 beans.
 Of this amount the US will supply 10.9
 million tons. The USSR has bought 6.7
 million tons under the first year of the
 US-USSR grain agreement and must buy
 355,000 tons more of wheat to satisfy
 the provision that the first 6 million
 tons be equally divided between wheat
 and corn.
 So far, the Soviets have promised little
 grain to their traditional customers. We
 expect that about 2 to 3 million tons of
 grain will be shipped to Eastern Europe.
 Should the Soviet harvest exceed our ex-
 pectations, Eastern Europe might well
 press for additional amounts of grain
 from the Soviets, but will remain depen-

 The government has taken strong measures to stabilize the
 economy, which was unsettled by the recent currency change.
 Mexico: Economic Measures
 Mexico is taking steps to stabilize the
 economy in the wake of the recent 37-per-
 cent drop in the value of the peso. The
 government has imposed harsh new price
 controls, initiated curbs on government
 spending, and granted relatively restrain-
 ed wage increases.
 These moves are likely to have a
 favorable psychological impact on the
 public, which had been losing confidence
 in the government's ability to control the
 effects of the peso float. They will also
 help to ensure that the economy does not
 lose the stimulus to exports normally ex-
 pected from currency devaluation.
 New official price levels decreed by
 President Echeverria mean that most
 prices, which had skyrocketed following
 the devaluation, will be rolled back. The
 government has limited the price increase
 for most basic consumer goods to 10 per-
 cent and has greatly expanded the list of
 regulated goods and services.
 Nearly all basic foodstuffs, clothing,
 chemicals, basic raw materials, construc-
 tion  materials,  household  appliances,
 automobiles, and services such as auto
 repairs and hospital care will now be con-
 trolled. To avoid discouraging tourism,
 hotel rates cannot be increased by more
 than 20 percent and restaurant prices 15
 percent. Prices for petroleum products,
 natural gas, and unrefined sugar-all
 produced from domestic materials-re-
 main frozen.
 Strict Enforcement
 The government intends to enforce its
 price controls strictly. Violators will be
 subject to 3-month jail terms and $2,500
 fines. The government's inspection staff
 probably will concentrate on the larger
 manufacturing and retail concerns. Com-
 panies able to prove their costs have gone
 up more than 10 percent will be permitted
 to petition for additional price increases.
 Prices ultimately may rise l5 to 20 per-
 cent as a consequence of the devaluation,
 but this increase will still leave a substan-
 tial price benefit to exporters.
 Wages for government employees will
 be increased 21 to 23 percent, reportedly
 to cover the rise in the cost of living
 between January and August as well as to
 compensate for the new 10-percent price
 increase. Echeverria also set guidelines for
 private sector wages because of the failure
 to reach a compromise between the
 l0-percent increase offered by manage-
 ment and the 65-percent hike demanded
 by labor under threat of a general strike.
 The guidelines call for a 16- to 23-per-
 cent rise, but companies engaged in
 scheduled annual wage negotiations over
 the next several months probably will be
 forced to pay an additional 10-percent in-
 crease.
 Government Spending Cut
 The government also has imposed
 drastic curbs on government spending, the
 first sign of Echeverria's willingness to
 face up to the mounting government
 deficits of recent years. Government hir-
 ing has been frozen and new investment
 undertakings have been banned.
 Although these curbs probably will
 have little impact on the 1976 deficit, they
 will set the tone for the 1977 budget and
 are expected to have a significant psy-
 chological impact. The government's
 borrowing to finance its deficit has been
 the major source of new money fueling in-
 flation.
 The stabilization measures doubtless
 have the approval of president-elect
 Lopez Portillo, who believes that the
 restoration of financial stability will be
 one of his most important, duties when he
 assumes office in December. While in
 Washington late last month, Lopez Por-
 tillo implied that his fiscal program would
 be  more austere tha       verria's.
