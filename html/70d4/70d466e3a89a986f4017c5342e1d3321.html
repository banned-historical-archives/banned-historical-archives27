 The Aims of Peiping's Foreign Policy
 Communist China's long run objective is the es-
 tablishment of a Communist world patterned on Pei-
 ping's own militant revolutionary brand of Marxism-
 Lenism.   But this is for the present clearly more
 an article of faith--a future condition to be hoped
 for--than an immediate goal of Peiping's foreign policy.
 During the next few years the Chinese Commu-
 nists will strive for intermediate objectives de-
 signed to prepare the way for bolder advances later
 on.   Peiping's current efforts are aimed at eject-
 ing US power from the mainland of East Asia,  increas-
 ing Chinese influence in the underdeveloped world,
 and supplanting Moscow as leader of the world Commu-
 nist movement, in free-world parties and even inside
 the bloc.
 These objectives and the methods by which they
 are pursued are shaped by Maoist ideology, Chinese
 tradition, Peiping's power position, and the personali-
 ties of the Chinese leaders themselves.
 China's Leaders
 Mao and his lieutenants are dedicated,  fanatic mis-
 Communists with tremendous energy.   They have a mes-
 sianic conviction of the righteousness of their
 cause, the correctness of their doctrine and the in-
 evitability of their success.   The Chinese leaders
 exhibit the traditional China-centered view of
 history and civilization marked by an arrogant,
 patronizing attitude toward other nations.   This
 has been intensified by Peiping's success in reas-
 serting Chinese independence and power after nearly
 a century of foreign domination which left deep
 scars and led the Chinese to count themselves among
 the victims of colonialism and racial exploitation.

 The unique experience of the Chinese Communist
 Party (CCP) in fighting its way to power in over two
 decades of guerrilla warfare  against vast odds has
 strongly conditioned the thinking of the Chinese
 leaders.   Mao Tse-tung and his veteran colleagues
 have so adapted communism to reflect Chinese ex-
 perience that in practice the Chinese and Communist
 ingredients are thoroughly mingled.   To a considerable
 extent then, Peiping's foreign policy is a projection
 into the world arena of the principles and concepts
 developed in the prosecution of China's long civil
 war.   Indeed, Communist China's foreign policy is
 primarily a strategy for revolutionary war.   That
 is, it apparently is conceived in terms of conflict
 rather than of adjusting relations with other states
 by negotiations; revolutionary wars against those
 who align themselves with China's opponents are en-
 couraged and supported; and any compromise or con-
 cession, except those made expedient by some tactical
 situation, is viewed as surrender.   International
 politics is viewed as a great guerrilla struggle in
 which the opponent is to be constantly harassed and
 threatened.
 Communist Chinese staying power, the ability
 to concentrate on long-range goals no matter how
 hopeless the odds may seem at the moment, has been
 amply demonstrated.  After the Long March, even
 though Communist forces had dwindled to only about
 25,000 the leaders continued to focus their efforts
 on the time when they would come to control all of
 China.
 The Chinese have been sustained by the con-
 viction that a tightknit, determined group following
 correct Communist principles could in time wear down
 an enemy--no matter how great his initial superiority--
 and eventually reduce him to absolute inferiority.
 A key element in the concept of protracted struggle
 has been Mao's admonition to have contempt for the
 enemy strategically but to respect him tactically.
 In other words, one must have confidence in one's
 own ability and the utmost contempt for the enemy.
 At the same time, however, in actual engagements the
 weaker force must always take into account the im-
 mediately superior strength of its adversary.   Peiping's
 foreign policy. has thus come to have a grand and dangerous
 ambitions but is almost always cautious and realistic
 in practice.

 A degree of caution is also forced on Peiping's
 policymakers by what the Communists term "objective
 circumstances."  Communist China is an underdeveloped
 country and its armed forces are unable to conduct
 the technologically advanced warfare of which the
 US and the USSR are capable; hence China poses a direct
 military threat only in nearby parts of Asia.   Long-
 term economic problems, especially the pressure of
 population on the land, have limited Peiping's capa-
 bility for action outside China's frontiers.  On the
 other hand, the very size of China's population
 enables the regime to accept considerable manpower
 losses, and this along with China's enormous size
 makes Chinese leaders confident that, if necessary,
 China could absorb a tremendous amount of military
 punishment and still in the long run overwhelm an
 invading enemy.   It has even led them to make opti-
 mistic statements about their ability to weather a
 nuclear attack.
 China's Three World View
 China's leaders divide the nations of the world
 into three main groups:   the Communist world, which
 includes China and other bloc states; the capitalist
 world, which includes the US, Western Europe,  the
 white nations of the British Commonwealth, and Japan;
 and the Third World, which includes the underdeveloped,
 ex-colonial, nations.
 The Capitalist World
 For both ideological and nationalistic reasons
 the Chinese regard the US as their number one enemy.
 From the ideological point of view, the US as the
 leading "capitalist imperialist" power must be totally
 discredited to demonstrate the correctness of Chinese
 doctrine.   From the nationalistic point of view, the
 US frustrates Chinese ambitions in Asia and the Ameri-
 can military presence in the Western Pacific appears
 to Peiping to pose a major threat to China's security.
 Immediate security interests and the short reach of
 its military power leads Peiping to concentrate its
 main efforts on changing the balance of forces in the
 Far East, stirring up anti-American feeling and under-
 mining US alliances and military base agreements.
 Elsewhere the Chinese are also intensifying their efforts
 to weaken the American position and to establish the US
 in the eyes of Asians, Africans, and Latin Americans as
 the white imperialist oppressor.

 Approved For Release 200,VktWIPRDP79T00472AO00800010009-1
 Other areas of the capitalist world such as West-
 ern Europe and Japan are conveniently labeled an "in-
 termediate zone" by the Chinese--a means of justifying
 and rationalizing Peiping's efforts to seek economic
 and other contacts.  Here, as elsewhere, the Chinese
 seek to enhance their own power and prestige and under-
 cut US leadership.  Peiping has dispatched wide-ranging
 purchasing missions, and competition for new markets
 leads Western and Japanese industrialists to press for
 improved relations with Peiping.
 The Communist World
 The Soviet Union has recently come to rival the
 US as the main threat to Chinese ambitions.   Well be-
 fore the Sino-Soviet split surfaced in 1960 nationalistic
 and ideological factors combined to produce a growing
 enmity.  Peiping, now struggling with Moscow for lead-
 ership of the world Communist movement, regards Soviet
 "revisionism" as a dangerously degenerate force which
 is leading the movement to destruction.   Ideological
 conflicts are overlayed on traditional anti-Russian
 feeling stemming from Tsarist territorial grabs.  Chi-
 nese leaders are nervously conscious of their long
 common frontier with the USSR and on guard against So-
 viet subversion among border minorities.
 Bitter Chinese attacks on the Soviet leadership
 are conducted throughout the world and at all levels.
 Nonbloc  Communist parties have become major Sino-Soviet
 battlegrounds.  In some countries such as Japan and
 New Zealand the Chinese have captured the local Com-
 munist parties.   In others, especially in Latin America
 and Western Europe, they are promoting dissident fac-
 tions and supporting separate pro-Peiping party organiza-
 tions.   In international Communist front movements the
 Chinese have made a major effort to capture the leader-
 ship and to swing these organizations behind China's
 militant policies.   For example, such forums as the
 World Peace Council and the World Federation of Trade
 Unions have been repeatedly disrupted by polemical
 wrangling.
 Today, both the capitalist and Communist worlds
 are devoting a very considerable effort to coping with
 problems at least in part created by Peiping, and the
 Chinese have come to have a far greater impact-every-
 where than their military or economic power would seem
 to justify.

 This is primarily because large areas of the world
 are peculiarly vulnerable to Chinese troublemaking.  The
 rapid dissolution of colonial empires in Asia and
 Africa has left a political vacuum marked by weak,:in-
 experienced governments and uncertain, shifting na-
 tional alignments.   With large expectations and small
 capabilities, their people often grow frustrated with
 the status quo and are attracted to radical "solutions"
 to tTFe_    icu It ies .
 At the present time most of China's foreign policy
 efforts are being channeled into two basic struggles:
 the drive to achieve great power status, international
 respectability, and world-wide influence and the si-
 multaneous, two-pronged challenge to the US and the
 USSR.  These threads intertwine and pervade all aspects
 of Chinese Communist foreign relations.  However,
 while Peiping has shown a readiness to take on Wash-
 ington and Moscow at the same time, it has cautiously
 sought to avoid a head-on struggle with two adversaries
 of such superior strength and has chosen the Third
 World as the main battleground.
 In the Third World--the underdeveloped nations
 of Asia, Africa, and Latin America--the Chinese aim
 not only to erode US influence but also to displace
 the Soviet leadership of leftist movements.   They
 champion popular causes and seek to establish them-
 selves as the mentors of the newly independent.
 Peiping emphasizes its identity of interests and
 experience with those of have-not nations.   Commu-
 nism,  as such,  often is not stressed but much is
 made of anti-imperialism and national liberation
 struggle.
 Diplomacy, trade and aid, propaganda, subver-
 sion, the implied threat of military force, and the
 specter of an approaching nuclear weapons capability
 are employed simultaneously and in varying propor-
 tions.   Of these propaganda is an instrument particu-
 larly suited to the evangelistic nature of Chinese
 Communism. Peiping, with limited material power, often
 uses it with great skill.
 In the Third World the Chinese also appear to
 lay great store in guerrilla warfare following Mao's
 guidelines,  and they provide moral and material support

 for "wars of liberation" wherever possible.  One of
 the advantages of such support for insurgency is that
 it can be pursued at low cost and little risk to
 Communist China itself.  Peiping supplies training,
 advice, small quantities of weapons, and massive
 propaganda support.   Thus, with a relatively modest
 investment the Chinese have been a major factor in
 the creation of the difficult situations which face
 anti-Communist forces in Africa and Southeast Asia.
 The Communist struggle for control of South Viet-
 nam is of paramount current interest to the Chinese.,
 Peiping's priorities of action are determined by the
 Chinese ability to influence events, and Southeast
 Asia and particularly Vietnam, being in what Peiping
 considers its security zone, are receiving top at-
 tention.  Vietnam is the place where short-term aims,
 long-term ambitions, and most facets of Chinese for-
 eign policy come into focus.   Indeed, a large meas-
 ure of Peiping's concern over developments in Viet-
 nam springs from the effect they can have on Peiping's
 broader struggles with Washington and Moscow.
 It is clear Peiping sees the Vietnam struggle as
 an opportunity to demonstrate the correctness of its
 line that the US is a "paper tiger," and that a
 properly conducted "war of liberation" can be brought
 off in the face of US military power without precipitat-
 ing a major international war.  At the same time Com-
 munist victory would vindicate the Chinese line in
 the Communist dispute over tactics, and Soviet pre-
 tensions to leadership of the world movement would
 be discredited.   US prestige would be seriously dam-
 aged and the US ability to help cope with local guer-
 rilla warfare would be placed in doubt.  At the same
 time Peiping's stature throughout the world would be
 enhanced. On the other hand, a Communist failure in
 Vietnam would tend to discredit Peiping and to check
 the momentum of China's drive for greater international
 influence.   Thus,  the stakes in Vietnam are clearly
 high for China's leaders.
 Nevertheless,  they wish to avoid escalation of
 the struggle into a major Sino-American war, which
 might bring about the destruction of China's industrial
 and advanced weapons facilities.   While Peiping's

 leaders may be optimistic that a wider war can be
 avoided, they have been making preparations against
 the possibility of at least a limited engagement
 growing out of US attacks against North Vietnam.
 Thus far, they have avoided risky countermoves to
 limit the northward extension of US air strikes
 against targets in North Vietnam.   It is likely,
 however, that, the Chinese leaders would be prepared
 to risk a major military conflict with the US
 should they feel their vital security interests
 threatened.
 The Communists almost certainly believe that
 the tide is running strongly in their favor in
 South Vietnam.   They therefore are encouraging the
 Viet Cong and Hanoi to hold on and,to step up their
 pressures in the South.   In the meanwhile they are
 trying to generate international pressures for a ces-
 sation of US bombings and a complete American with-
 drawal.
 In the rest of Southeast Asia, unless the situa-
 tion alters drastically, the Chinese appear content
 to continue their current policies.   They will en-
 courage Sukarno's aggressive anti-Western actions
 and give strong backing to the pro-Peiping Indonesian
 Communist Party.   They will fan the Indonesia-
 Malaysia confrontation, probably estimating that
 British and American influence in the region can
 be weakened at little cost to China.   In Thailand
 they are likely to encourage increased dissident
 activity, while in Cambodia they will do what they
 can to further Sihanouk's chronic distrust of his
 neighbors and the US.   Their guarded tolerance of
 Ne Win's Burma will probably continue.
 In Northeast Asia, Peiping is evidently forced
 to take a long view.   Its objective of a Communist
 regime in prosperous Japan is a faraway goal at
 best, and for the present the Chinese appear'dontent
 to stir up discord in Tokyo's relations with the US
 as well as with Nationalist China and South Korea.
 Acting through the Japanese Communist Party,  in which
 they are the dominant influence, the Chinese will
 abet nationalist and leftist agitation for the scrapping
 of the US-Japanese Defense treaty and the removal of
 US bases from Japan and Okinawa.

 In South Asia, Peiping will continue to court
 the Pakistanis and fan Karachi's fears of India and
 the effects of US military aid to India.   Little
 improvement in Sino-Indian relations appears likely,
 but Peiping will probably seek to avoid another major
 flare-up in border fighting.   The small Himalayan
 kingdoms, however, will be the targets of increased
 pressure designed to bring them more under Communist
 influence.   In Ceylon, Peiping has less influence
 with the Senanayake government than it had under the
 Bandaranaike administration, and through Communist
 supporters, it may promote strikes and other demon-
 strations of opposition.
 In Africa, considering that Peiping's serious
 bid for significant influence is scarcely three
 years old, its impact has been remarkable.   Commu-
 nist China has succeeded in winning recognition
 from many of.the new nations and will probably win
 over still others.   The Chinese have made considerable
 political mileage out of economic aid offers extended
 on a no-strings basis, and high-level personal diplo-
 macy appears to have paid dividends.   Chou En-lai has
 visited Africa three times in the past year and a
 large number of African leaders have been flattered
 by spectacular receptions in Peiping.   In the search
 for close political friends and revolutionary allies,
 however, the Chinese also employ clandestine means.
 Africans are brought to China for training in sub-
 version and guerrilla warfare and arms are secretly
 supplied to active and potential revolutionaries on
 the continent.
 In Latin America,  Communist China's official
 presence is still very small--one embassy and two
 trade offices--but Peiping is working to strengthen
 ties with its supporters, and the hemisphere has be-
 come a Sino-Soviet battleground of major importance.
 In Latin American Communist parties Peiping's ex-
 hortations to head-on revolutionary struggle strike
 a sympathetic chord among dissident elements eager to
 wrest power from the Moscow-oriented old guard lead-
 ership.  A new complicating factor for the Chinese,
 however, may be the sharp deterioration of Sino-Cuban
 relations over the past year.   If this trend continues,
 Peiping's Latin American ambitions may be impeded by
 Castroite as well as Soviet opposition.

 International Organizations
 The UN poses a dilemma for Peiping.   On the
 one hand, the Communist Chinese feel they deserve
 one of the big five seats, and they will continue
 to welcome international support for their member-
 ship and attempt to exploit US opposition.  On the
 other hand, however, they resent the annual humilia-
 tion of being rejected for membership.  The UN effort
 against them in Korea still rankles, and they have
 continued to display particular annoyance at all UN
 peacekeeping operations, which are aimed at damping
 down the very type of disorder the Chinese are
 anxious to promote.
 They currently excoriate the world organization
 as a tool of the US and apparently have no desire to
 be a part of an effective international body.  Rather
 they continue to press for a drastic reorganization
 in hopes that it will facilitate the exploitation
 and eventual destruction of the UN.  At present, they
 are clearly unwilling to pay a price for admission
 and prefer to sit tight, stubbornly demanding the
 expulsion of Nationalist China.  Peiping's leaders
 seem to believe that, although they can continue
 to get along outside the UN, the UN will be hard
 pressed to function while a nuclear power controlling
 nearly a quarter of the world's population remains
