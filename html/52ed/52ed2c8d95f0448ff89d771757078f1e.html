 Inefficiency in Italian industry and the Commu-

 reorganizing important segments of industry owned by
 the state.   The proposal provides an important test
 of the Scelba government's ability to push through
 socio-economic reforms in the face of stiff opposi-
 tion.

 NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN SOVIET RURAL ADMINISTRATION .  .  . Page 14
 The immediate objective of recent changes in
 Soviet rural administration is to increase agricul-
 tural production, but the new measures were also
 formed with an eye to bringing the Russian peasant
 under greater state control and ultimately trans-
 forming him into a laborer working for wages like
 the industrial worker..

 The ninth UN General Assembly, which opens on

 West problems such as Korea and disarmament, as well
 as two new colonial issues--Cyprus and New Guinea--
 which could lead to serious discord among non-Communist
 members.  While antagonism and pique toward the United
 States will probably be reflected in some of the voting,
 a majority of the UN members are likely to support
 Washington on cold-war matters.

 The Orbit campaign to develop broad European opposition
 to German rearmament, highlighted by the Soviet Foreign
 Ministry statement of 9 September, has continued to gather
 momentum.   The statement contained no new formula for solving
 the German problem, but made abundantly clear the USSR's
 opposition to any form of West German rearmament and inclusion
 in a Western defense system.   Allegations that German rearma-
 ment would increase the danger of war and deprive France of
 its status as a great power were directed at Paris, while a
 threat that rearmament would indefinitely postpone German
 unity was obviously aimed at German ears.
 East German premier Grotewohl, meanwhile, called for
 "united action of the German working class" against rearmament,
 and appealed especially to the West German Social Democratic
 Party.   Grotewohl also emphasized the "bonds of brotherhood"
 with the French Communist Party and the French working masses.
 Pravda's strong attack on British Labor Party leader
 Attlee on 9 September also appeared to be part of the campaign
 against German rearmament since it was clearly an attempt to
 influence the forthcoming Labor Party conference.   Moscow has
 recently devoted much attention to a Bevanite pamphlet,   It
 Need Not Happen--The Alternative to German Rearmament.    Recent
 information on the Moscow reception in August for the British
 Labor delegation has revealed that Soviet leaders concentrated
 their attention on Bevan and almost completely ignored Attlee.
 The USSR, feeling secure in its control of the European
 Satellites, is apparently trying to reduce what may now be an
 excessive number of "advisers."  A "sizable number" of Soviet
 civilian administrators and technicians in Hungary are reported
 to be preparing to return to the USSR, possibly as a result of
 the reduction in Hungarian government spending and the cutback
 in the size of the bureaucracy.  Other recent reports describe      25X1
 withdrawals of Soviet technicians from the Polish shipyards in
 Gdansk and in Stettin, where the Soviet Union allegedly plans       25X1
 to relinquish its administration of part of the  or  area.
 most of the Soviet advisers in Czech agriculture were
 withdrawn by'the summer of 1953.   Moscow may require the ser-
 vices of these experts in the USSR or may be motivated by a
 desire to reduce public awareness of Soviet control.  No re-
 duction has been reported in the number of Soviet advisers
 attached to Satellite military or security organizations.

 The official interpreters of the British Labor Party dele-
 gation, Lord and Lady Lindsay, who know China and its Communist
 leaders from Yenan days, have stated that their recent visit
 did nothing to dispel their theory that Peiping's leaders live
 in a sort of "dogmatic dream world."  Lady Lindsay thought the
 Chinese people had been rallied  to the point where they would
 support military action against Formosa.  Lord Lindsay said
 there was no appreciation at all of the population problem,
 with the Ministry of Agriculture taking the attitude of "more
 hands, more output."
 Evidence of the enhanced stature of Mao Tse-tung in the
 Communist world is contained in the 1953 edition of the Soviet
 Encyclopedia.   In contrast to the 1936 edition it transfers
 credit from Stalin to Mao as the chief architect of Chinese
 revolutionary theory and practice.   Mao's more radical writings
 and his 1927 practices--for which he was dismissed from the
 Chinese politburo--are rationalized in the new work as a
 "creative application" of Marxist-Leninist principles to the
 "peculiar situation" in China.
 Mao is portrayed in the new volume as the leading proponent
 of "correct" Marxism who was thwarted by "deviationists."  This
 snubbing of Stalin's controversial 1926-1928 policies and purifi-
 cation  of Mao represent Soviet acknowledgment of and accommoda-
 tion to Mao's victory in China.   The Soviet Union would seem to
 be accepting Mao as the major living contributor to Marxist
 theory.
 Further evidence of the improved status of China in the
 Communist world was suggested in the exchange of greetings
 between Malenkov and Mao on the 2 September anniversary of the
 Japanese surrender.   Malenkov's message contained a more gen-
 erous acknowledgment than in the past of the role of the "heroic
 Chinese people" who "have made outstanding contributions to the
 defeat of imperialist Japan."   In contrast, Mao's greeting to
 the Soviet leaders omitted previous standard references to the
 specific role of the USSR in entering the Pacific war and neg-
 lected to include last year's note of gratitude for postwar
 "fraternal assistance" from the Soviet Union.

 SOUTH KOREA PROVOKING DISPUTE WITH JAPAN OVER LIANCOURT ROCKS
 South Korea's armed occupation of disputed Liancourt Rocks--
 called Takeshima by Japan and Toktb by South Korea--is another
 artificially created but highly volatile episode in the larger
 sphere of Korean-Japanese conflicts.   There is the possibility
 of an armed incident which either government, for prestige pur-
 poses, may exploit far beyond its actual importance.
 Both Seoul and Tokyo have laid historical and geographical
 claims to the normally uninhabited Liancourt Rocks (see map,
 p.   7).   Early this year, South Korea asserted that Japanese
 defense measures in the Tsushima Strait  endangered the South
 Korean coast guard patrolling the "Rhee line," a zone in inter-
 national waters off Korea Irom which Seoul arbitrarily excludes
 Japanese fishermen.   In April, President Rhee created a "Lian-
 court Self-Defense Force" to protect the island against a
 "Japanese invasion."
 In June, Japanese officials stated that Japan must be
 ready "to protect its right to Liancourt against South Korea,"
 but an attempt by Japanese legislators to visit the island was
 stopped by the South Korean coast guard.   After protesting that
 Japan had strafed,  photographed,  surveyed and landed armed
 police on the island, South Korea in August settled a number
 of fishermen and erected a lighthouse there.   In early September,
 Seoul dispatched a garrison of what the press called "hundreds
 of police" to Liancourt.
 Since Rhee returned from his Washington visit, during which
 he failed to attain his objective of changing America's "pro-
 Japanese" policies, his vilification of Japan has greatly
 increased.   The Korean press announcement of the Liancourt
 occupation was deliberately provocative.   South Korea's
 activities involving the Liancourt Rocks, therefore, at once
 reflect Rhee's ingrained hostility toward Japan, an effort to
 regain lost prestige at home, and an intent to generate tension
 with Japan as a bargaining maneuver in his negotiations with
 the United States.
 The Japanese government has branded the armed occupation
 as "illegal entry into Japanese territory."  In the face of the
 government's announcement that it does not at present plan to
 use its navy to dislodge the Koreans, demands are already being
 heard in Diet committees for a stronger policy toward Korea.  By
 the time the Diet reconvenes in November, sufficient pressure
 may have been built up to force the government into action.

 EGYPTIAN ATTITUDES TOWARD NEAR EASTERN DEFENSE
 Prime Minister Nasr's statements and maneuvers on defense
 plans in the month following the Suez settlement pose a serious
 problem for American efforts to obtain an adequate defense ar-
 rangement in the Near East.   The regime appears to have little
 concern for strategic considerations, and seems to be primarily
 interested in assuring Egyptian leadership of any defense organ-
 ization which includes the Arab states.   To this end, the Egyp-
 tian government is currently exerting every effort to prevent
 Iraq from joining the Turkish-Pakistani Pact and thereby weak-
 ening Nasr's bargaining position with the West.
 The American embassy in Cairo has commented on the diffi-
 culty in dealing with the Egyptian leaders because of their in-
 experience and immaturity in matters of international affairs.
 This is particularly the case on the question of area defense
 on which the regime's position is determined by popular miscon-
 ceptions of Arab capabilities and the nature of modern war.
 Nasr's insistence, in an interview with American correspondents
 on 9 August, that the Arabs are capable of defending the area
 without Western assistance and that the Egyptians do-not need
 foreign training missions but can learn to use jets and other
 modern equipment "from reading books" dramatizes the unrealis-
 tic attitude of this group toward the problem of defense.
 The regime is opposed to any formal defense alignment with
 the West for what Nasr terms "psychological" reasons.   These
 he describes as the Arab "complex" toward Western domination
 and the fear that any pact with the West would end in new "ex-
 ploitations,"  Nasr, accordingly, seeks a purely Arab defense
 arrangement based on the three-year-old and still unimplemented
 Arab Collective Security Pact.   The organization would be based
 on the Arab League and thus include such military vacuums as
 Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Lebanon.   Such a grouping is
 without military capability or potential.   Judging from past
 Arab efforts at military co-operation, it could be expected to
 result in nothing but wrangling and ineffectual discussion.
 The confusion surrounding Egypt's efforts to forestall pos-
 sible Iraqi adherence to the Turkish-Pakistani Pact emerged in
 the regime's handling of the talks with Iraq in late August.
 It was immediately apparent from official accounts'that'."the
 youthful Major Salim, the Egyptian regime's expert on foreign
 affairs, and the veteran Iraqi premier, Nuri Said, differed
 substantially in their interpretations of their agreement on

 defense plans.   Nuri indicated to Western officials that the
 agreement provided for an approach to the United States and
 Britain for co-ordinated defense planniny_
 un e y to lessen its opposition to Iraqi par-
 ticipation in the Turkish-Pakistani Pact or to accept Western
 strategic appraisals which do not offer Egypt a dominant role.
 The regime may, accordingly, be expected to engage in a series
 of delaying maneuvers among the Arab. states to prevent early
 action to implement Western defense requirements in the Near
 East.

 The Communist campaign of subversion and "selective terror-
 ism" has been hampered by improved government intelligence and
 military operations, by the resettlement of Chinese squatters--
 who constituted an important source of food--from the jungle
 fringes to enclosed,  guarded villages,  and to a slight extent
 by government psychological warfare.
 In adjusting to government pressures and their own change
 in strategy,  the Communists have perceptibly tightened their
 security,  improved their military tactics, and stressed
 selection of military targets which they know are within their
 capabilities.   Some of their military personnel are believed to
 have been "demobilized," and others to have been relegated to
 food cultivation, still the Communists' chief operational prob-
 lem.   Great stress has been placed on the development of
 efficient "armed work forces."   These groups constitute a merger
 of elements of the party's military and civilian organizations
 and provide the principal link with the "masses."   The party,
 which is composed principally of Malayan-born Chinese, is also
 increasing its activity among Malays and Indians.   The polit-
 buro is believed to have moved north from the state of Pahang
 in central Malaya to the Thai border area, both for reasons of
 security and to facilitate communications with the Thai and
 other Communist movements.
 Progress in subversion has been noted particularly among
 small capitalists,  one of the main Communist targets.   In
 Johore,  the principal rubber producing state,  where the Commu-
 nists have displayed their greatest strength,                        party contacts
 or members are now found in higher strata of society than
 previously, and government authorities are finding increasing
 evidence of greater sympathy among small holders, shopkeepers,
 and other minor capitalists for the Communist cause.   Since
 such persons frequently participate in village government,
 the Communists can use them to influence village affairs.

 Communist subversion of special constables and home guards
 continues.   Both organizations consist of individuals recruited
 locally to guard estates, mines, and villages.   In a number of
 instances, they are known to have supplied the Communists with
 arms, ammunition,  information, and supplies.   Of 56 reported
 cases of home guard assistance to the terrorists over a 12-month
 period in the state of Kelantan, 10 persons were revealed as
 motivated by sympathy and 15 others by bribery; the remaining
 cases apparently resulted from coercion.
 The Communists now take selected individuals to jungle
 camps for indoctrination courses and then return them to their
 homes for underground activity.   "Armed work forces" increas-
 ingly,enter villages and rubber-tapping areas to deliver
 political lectures.   Cells are increasing in resettled villages
 and small towns, and they continue to flourish in Chinese
 schools.   The number of Chinese students traveling to Communist
 China this year for higher education is three times as great as
 the number during the preceding year.   Communist influence among
 labor is believed still to be largely confined to employees on
 small holdings and Asian-owned estates.
 Militarily the Communists' continued success in guerrilla
 warfare permits them to stage ambushes when and where they
 choose.  An example is the ambush-murder of C. N. Godwin, the
 senior police officer for the states of Kedah and Perlis, last
 May.   Moreover, the Communists' prospects in Malaya, although
 long-range, have been improved by events in Indochina.  Their
 morale, as reflected in the decreased number of terrorist
 surrenders, appears to be on the upswing following Viet Minh
 successes.
 In their efforts to infiltrate the increasingly articulate
 independence movement, the Communists are chiefly using their
 contacts among members of the outlawed and Communist-influenced
 Malay Nationalist Party.   Communist documents emphasize that
 former members of the Nationalist Party and its affiliated youth
 and women's organizations are more readily susceptible to the
 united front idea than any other group in Malaya.   Ex-Nationalist
 members have joined the principal Malay political organization,
 the United Malay Nationalist Organization.  The Communist Party
 itself is reportedly following a propaganda line in its work
 among the Malays to the effect that Malays, Chinese,  and
 Communists should consolidate their efforts. in the common
 struggle against the British.

 IMPLICATIONS OF THE PASTORE PROPOSAL
 FOR REORGANIZING ITALIAN INDUSTRY
 Inefficiency in Italian industry and the Communists'
 hold over labor are the targets of a proposal, approved by
 the Chamber of Deputies on 3 August, for reorganizing important
 segments of industry owned by the state,  The proposal, put
 forward by Christian Democratic labor leader Uiulio Pastore,
 has aroused strong opposition from vested interests.   Action on
 it may determine the success of the Scelba government's whole
 program of socio-economic reform.
 Of Italy's serious economic difficulties, one of the few
 subject to attack by Italy alone is the inability of many
 industries to compete in world markets.   The effects of obso-
 lescent equipment and other technological factors have been
 aggravated by restrictive business practices  maintained by
 Confindustria, the powerful association representing manage-
 ment.   Many firms have been kept in business only by government
 subsidies.
 Among the more inefficient enterprises are those owned
 by the government but privately operated under the loose super-
 vision of the Institute for Industrial Reconstruction (IRI),
 which was created in the early 1930's to put the nation.'s
 banks and industrial enterprises on their feet.   The present
 IRI complex probably employs less than 10 percent of the
 2,000,000 in Confindustria firms as a whole, but dominates
 certain basic industries such as iron and steel, machinery,
 and shipbuilding.
 With general industrial reform his avowed purpose, Giulio
 Pastore, head of the Christian Democratic-oriented labor con-
 federation (CISL), persuaded the Chamber of Deputies to pass
 a motion calling on the government to detach the IRI firms from
 Confindustria and make IRI a public instrument of industrial
 policy to spur the modernization of factories, improve labor
 relations, and help labor to participate in management's deci-
 sions.   He is reported to envisage the return of some 70 per-
 cent of the IRI companies to private ownership over the next
 six or seven years and the reorganization of the remainder
 under closer government control to serve, among other things,
 as a  yardstick of efficient industrial management.
 Probably the most immediate aim of Pastore's motion was
 to improve his own labor organization's bargaining position
 in competition with the much larger Communist-dominated General

 Labor Confederation (CGIL)o   A large sector of Confindustria
 now prefers to deal with CGIL as the strongest and most respon-
 sible spokesman for the workers.  Under government direction,
 however, IRI firms would presumably give preference to CISL,
 particularly since this would help make eligible for American
 offshore procurement contracts various factories now regarded
 as security risks.   Concessions won by CISL in IRI firms would
 in turn strengthen the free unions vis-a-vis the Communists
 elsewhere in Italian industry.
 The present organization of Italian industry has provoked
 efforts at reform from such diverse sources as the original
 ECA mission and Nenni Socialist officials in CGIL, and the
 Pastore proposal initially attracted widespread support.  The
 Christian Democrats'  national congress endorsed it in June,
 the Scelba cabinet approved it in early July, and only the
 Liberals, Monarchists and neo-Fascists opposed it in the 3
 August vote.
 Since then, however, opposition to the measure has grown.
 The present IRI management and other interested parties in
 Confindustria have raised various technical objections and are
 exerting powerful political and economic influence against the
 proposal.  Confindustria, which draws much of its funds from
 IRI,is in turn a major source of funds for the center parties,
 and there have been threats that these contributions might be
 switched to the right-wing parties.   The Communists have not
 yet attacked the Pastore proposal but probably will as soon
 as they see means of exploiting the controversy for their own
 purposes.
 Christian Democratic leaders have grown worried about
 party unity and some of them, including party secretary Fanfani,
 induced the government, prior to the chamber vote, to announce
 that implementation of the Pastore motion must wait until the
 commission which has been studying the IRI complex for the
 past year makes its report some time this fall.
 In the long run, the Pastore proposal appears to offer--
 despite certain questionable technical features--a means of
 correcting basic weaknesses of the Italian economy.   To the
 extent that it would strengthen the free trade unions, it would
 also substantially aid the government?s anti-Communist program.
 In the short run, the proposal provides an important test of
 the Scelba government's ability to push through its program of
 socio-economic reform in the face of stiff opposition.

 NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN SOVIET RURAL ADMINISTRATION
 Developments in Soviet rural administration during the
 past year reveal that the Communist leaders have not abandoned
 their 35-year battle to bring the Russian peasant under greater
 state control and ultimately transform him into a laborer
 working for wages like the industrial worker,  While the im-
 mediate objective of the recent changes is to increase farm
 production and in particular to obtain greater deliveries to
 the state9 the new measures were also framed with an eye to
 the long-term goal of a "classless society."
 The measures of greatest long-run significance are those
 designed to tighten state control over the peasant and his
 agricultural operations.   This control has been strengthened
 by placing a district party secretary in each machine tractor
 station and making him responsible for unified political con-
 trol over the entire zone serviced by that station.   In addi-
 tion, the directing fuaictioai of the tractor stations in the
 day-to-day administration of the collective farms has been
 broadened to such an extent that the stations virtually run
 the kolkhozes which they service.  Further party control has
 also been instituted by the assignment to agricultural areas
 of "plenipotentiary representatives" of the party's central
 committee,
 The most recent move of an institutional nature has been
 the amalgamation of rural soviets  (local units of government
 administration)  in June, July and August, reducing their num-
 ber by about one third.  This amalgamation will have a two-
 fold effect: rural administration will be more closely geared
 to the collective farm, since the boundaries of the new rural
 soviets will conform to the boundaries of the larger collec-
 tive farms created in the amalgamation of 1950, and a number
 of trained administrators will be available for other work.
 There is evidence that some ofg'these, at least, will be utilized
 as collective farm chairmen.
 As the units of rural administration become larger and
 more remote from the peasant, as machine tractor station plan-
 ning and direction increase and as more trained administrators
 are brought in from outside the kolkhoz for agricultural work,
 a further depersonalization in the peasant's attitude toward
 work may gradually set in and make him  more accustomed to a
 wage labor type of existence,

 An area in which the peasant is already being transferred
 to wage labor is in the machine tractor stations, whose perma-
 nent staff has been swelled by the addition of tractor drivers,
 foremen, bookkeepers and the like.   These were formerly mem-
 bers of a kolkhoz who worked only part time for the station.
 As agricultural operations become more and more mechanized,
 the transfer of an even larger number of peasants to this type
 of wage labor will be possible.
 One result of the August decree of the party's central
 committee relating to the expansion of the "new lands" pro-
 gram in Kazakhstan and Siberia will be an increase in the num-
 ber of peasants working for wages rather than sharing in the
 income of the farms.  Most of the land to be reclaimed after
 1955 is to be worked by state farms where wages are paid,
 rather than collective farms where the farmer's pay is a share
 in the farm's income.
 With regard to the immediate objective of increasing agri-
 cultural production, there has been an attempt to improve
 peasant morale and make work in the collective fields of kolk-
 hozes more attractive.   A series of decrees was issued wiping
 out past debts to the state, reducing current obligatory de-
 liveries and taxes, abolishing the practice of reaching planned
 targets by increasing levies on the more productive farms over
 and above their fair share, and re-emphasizing and adjusting
 the system of bonuses to give more substantial rewards for
 overfulfiliment of norms.
 These inducements, possibly because the peasants were
 simultaneously encouraged to improve their private plot
 operations, apparently did not prove sufficient to increase
 work on the collective lands, since the government has recently
 pressed collective farms to set new and higher norms for the
 minimum number of workdays their members must work for the
 kolkhoz.   This action, designed to force the sluggards and those
 who prefer to work their private plots to contribute their fair
 share to the collective, may affect a sizable minority of the
 peasants who in the past worked less than the new minimums will
 require.
 The ultimate aim of the government is to induce or force
 the peasant to work more of his time for the collective rather
 than on his personal plot, and eventually to eliminate the
 personal plot so that the state can directly control all agri-
 cultural output.  This remains the long-range goal of the adminis-
 trative and institutional changes introduced by the regime over
 the past year,  in spite of the limited encouragement presently
 given to private plots.

 SPECIAL ARTICLE
 PROSPECTS FOR THE NINTH UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY
 The agenda of the ninth UN General Assembly, which opens
 on 21 September, includes the usual East-West problems as well
 as some new issues which could lead to serious discord among
 non-Communist members.         While antagonism and pique toward the
 United States will probably be reflected in some of the voting,
 a majority of UN members are likely to support Washington on
 cold-war matters,
 In addition to such East-West perennials as Korea, global
 disarmament, and Chinese representation, the entire Indochina
 question may be aired.  Conflicts among the Western powers over
 colonial issues, previously evident in the North African dis-
 cussions, may be aggravated with the introduction of the Cyprus
 and West New Guinea questions,  A further tightening of Arab-
 Asian bloc voting seems likely, with more abstentions on East-
 West issues and a stronger   anticolonial stand.  Latin American
 support for the United States' position on major East-West
 issues will continue.
 The eighth General Assembly, which recessed on 9 December
 1953, deferred detailed discussion of the Korean question be-
 cause the Panmunjom talks were then in progress.   The ninth
 session will consider this question against the background of
 the Korean impasse and the Indochina settlement reached at Geneva.
 The American position that no useful purpose would be served
 now by.discussing Korean unification will probably receive
 majority support.   The report by the 16 participants on the UN
 side at Geneva stressed the USSR's opposition to UN supervision
 of genuinely free elections in Korea,
 the annua
 1--J
 on may contain some unfavorable criti-
 cisms of American actions.   South Korea's public threats to
 "march north" may prompt a move by some UN members to call
 on the Republic of Korea and the parties to the Armistice
 Agreement to keep the peace.
 Although the United States would like to see the Neutral
 Nations Supervisory Commission dissolved prior to the assembly
 meeting, the British believe the least objectionable way to
 achieve dissolution of the commission is to have Sweden initi-
 ate a discussion in the assembly of the commission's ineffec-
 tiveness.   South Korea has been insisting that the UN-appointed

 commission leave Korea prior to the assembly's opening, and
 American officials in Korea fear that failure of the Swiss
 and Swedes to make. an early decision to withdraw will result
 in officially inspired violence against the commission members.
 The American. delegation expects an attempt at this session
 to lift the UN embargo against Communist China imposed in 1951
 following the Chinese intervention in Korea.  The delegation
 believes that this idea is gaining favor in the UN.
 Disarmament
 The disarmament discussions held this summer in London
 among the "powers principally  .involved"--called for by a
 resolution of the eighth General Assembly--resulted in a stale-
 mate.   The Soviet demand for an immediate and unconditional
 ban on weapons of mass destruction, but without adequate pro-
 visions for enforcement, precluded any compromise solution.
 The USSR is expected to maintain this position, stressinu
 the Japanese report to the UN on the radiation incident and the
 complaint of the Marshallese to the Trusteeship Council on the
 effects of nuclear tests in their area.   It is likely that no
 Soviet-sponsored resolution will muster the necessary support
 and that the ninth General Assembly will call for a continua-
 tion of disarmament talks.   The growing neutralism among some
 UN members may, however, cause them to urge some compromise
 solution incompatible with the present American position.
 Chinese Representation
 Support for the seating of Communist China has slowly
 grown since the Korean armistice, and the number of UN members
 likely to abstain on this issue has increased.  A growing
 number of officials of various member states have publicly
 stated that the Peiping regime must eventually be represented
 in the UN.  New Zealand external affairs minister Webb so
 stated in a parliamentary debate on 8 July, and on 31 August
 the foreign ministers of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Iceland
 publicly took the same position.
 It is unlikely, however, that Communist China will be
 seated at the coming session.  A large majority of members is
 expected to support a procedural resolution to defer the issue,
 as in the past.  Britain and others among the 15 UN members
 which recognize the Peiping regime strongly favor this maneuver.

 Indochina
 The British UN delegation has expressed fear that any
 General Assembly discussion of the Indochina settlement reached
 at Geneva would publicize Western divergence of views on the
 issue.   It was for this reason that Britain induced Thailand
 last month to shelve its appeal to the General Assembly for a
 peace observation commission for the area.
 Australia, without consulting the United States, has
 introduced an item on the agenda entitled "Admission of Laos
 and Cambodia."  While the eligibility of these states for
 admission to the United Nations is strongly supported by the
 United States, and was affirmed by an overwhelming majority
 of the 1952 General Assembly, discussion of this item runs
 the same risk of opening up the Indochina issue.  The Soviet
 bloc would use it to repeat its assertions that inclusion of
 Laos and Cambodia in the Manila protocol violates the Geneva
 settlement,
 North Africa
 The Moroccan and Tunisian questions have again been placed
 on the agenda by the Arab-Asian bloc.  Discussion was bitter
 last year.  Lack of a two-thirds majority prevented passage of
 resolutions critical of French conduct in these perennial prob-
 lem                      areas.   This year,.lhowever., the reforms announced by the
 Mendes-France government may have a moderating influence
 on the debated
 West New Guinea
 The Indonesian request that the ninth General Assembly
 call upon the Netherlands to reopen negotiations over the
 status of Western New Guinea will probably involve the UN in
 a bitter discussion covering the whole field of colonialism
 and self-determination.   Indonesian claims to the territory,
 the status of which was left unsettled in the 1949 Indonesian
 settlement, are likely to receive the support of most of the
 Arab-Asian bloc,  Traditional Arab-Asian and Latin American
 bias against colonialism probably will not be tempered by the
 United States' "hands-off" policy.
 The Netherlands will most likely have the strong support
 of the other colonial powers in a protracted and bitter fight
 to prevent any General Assembly discussion of the issue.  The
 Dutch may attempt to keep the question within the Security
 Council by raising before that body alleged Indonesian viola-
 tions of the original 1949 agreement.

 Cyprus
 Greece's introduction of the Cyprus question into the
 UN has caused much consternation among the other NATO powers.
 Britain and Turkey oppose any UN discussion, but demarches to
 the Papagos'government designed to-prevent introduction of the
 item failed.
 Britain has indicated that it will absent itself from any
 committee discussion.   The British have also hinted that their
 support for the United States on other issues may be affected
 by Washington's stand on Cyprus.  The Western colonial powers
 most likely will support the British position actively, but it
 is unlikely that inscription of the item can be prevented.
 Administrative Problems
 Elections of officers at the forthcoming meeting present
 no serious problem for American interests.   The most contested
 election will be for the presidency of the ninth assembly.
 American support of Prince Wan of Thailand has greatly dis-
 appointed the Dutch,who were under the impression that the
 United States would support their candidate, former foreign
 minister Van Kleffens.  Under the geographic rotation prin-
 ciple the office would go to a Western European country this
 year since an Asian, Madame Pandit, was president of the
 eighth assembly.
