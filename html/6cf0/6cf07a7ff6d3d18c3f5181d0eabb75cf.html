 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 TAIWAN STRAIT SITUATION .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . Page  1
 The increasingly belligerent statements by Chinese
 Communist leaders and Premier Khrushchev's blunt warning
 to the United States are intended to serve notice that
 the bloc is prepared for a showdown over the offshore
 islands.   Bloc leaders may believe, 'however, that their
 present tactics will enable them to progress toward po-
 litical goals without major hostilities.   The USSR will
 probably raise the issue of "American provocations"
 against Communist China in the forthcoming UN General
 Assembly session, where a major debate over the question
 of Chinese representation appears in the making. Although
 Peiping has agreed to resume ambassadorial talks with the
 United States, if these talks fail to progress, the Com-
 munists will probably press for multilateral negotiations
 on a higher level.  Militarily the Chinese Communist naval
 build-up in the strait area continues.   Bombardment of the
 Kinmens has been light except for 8 September, when some
 50,000 rounds were fired against the islands.   The Chi-
 nese Nationalists have had difficulty in supplying Kin-
 men, even with American naval escorts.                    The dominant re-
 action throughout the free world to the prospect of Sino-
 American negotiations was one of relief, although there
 was no expectation that any permanent solution would be
 achieved,

 surances of noninterference in Jordan desired by King
 Husayn before the King agrees to the withdrawal of Brit-
 ish troops.   Jordanian officials consider the Hammarskjold
 mission has failed, and it is likely that Jordan will again
 place its complaint against UAR interference before the
 next UN General Assembly session.  Cairo is striving to in-
 crease its influence in the Iraqi armed forces, presumably
 to strengthen the faction, led by Deputy Prime Minister
 Arif, which favors membership in the UAR.

 PART II
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 USSR SCHEDULES 21ST PARTY CONGRESS FOR JANUARY .  .  .  .  .  . Page   1
 The Soviet party central committee on 5 September
 decided to convene an "extraordinary" 21st party con-
 gress on 27 January to discuss economic goals under
 the Seven-Year Plan (1959-65).   While the agenda does
 not provide for the election of a new central commit-
 tee, changes may be made in that body; it is also likely
 that membership changes in the party presidium and secre-
 tariat will be made in furtherance of Khrushchev's polit-
 ical control. The congress is expected to extol Khrushchev's
 economic policies in such appealing terms as to obscure the
 likelihood that a slower rate of improvement in living stand-
 ards will be necessary if the present rate of industrial
 growth is to be maintained.
 EAST GERMANY CONCERNED OVER REFUGEE FLIGHTS TO WEST  .  .  . Page   2
 East German officials are greatly concerned over
 the mass refugee flights to West Germany which have
 continued despite severe control measures in East Ger-
 many and East Berlin. The situation has also caused
 all the West German political parties to condemn strong-
 ly the political oppression in East German  which has             25X1
 caused this exodus.
 CZECH WAGE REFORM .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  . . Page 4
 A campaign is under way in Czechoslovakia to popu-
 larize wage reform measures and work norm revisions
 which will affect approximately two million industrial
 workers.   The regime hopes to lower costs and increase
 industrial output by raising labor productivity propor-
 tionately more than wages and by redistributing wage
 funds among workers.   While the regime plans to institute
 reforms cautiously, any rise in work norms is bound to
 antagonize labor and could hamper the regime's program
 for continued economic expansion.
 CAMBODIA .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . Page
 Premier Sihanouk seems likely to become even more
 uncompromising than in the past in handling Cambodia's
 border and other disputes with neighboring South Viet-
 nam and Thailand.                       His attempts to use Peiping as a
 counterweight to Saigon and Bangkok will probably ac-

 PART II (continued)
 May when government-staged demonstrations called for
 "volunteers" to aid the insurgents.   The present atti-
 tude may in part result from President Rhee's waning
 dynamism and gradual withdrawal from day-to-day politics.
 The poor health of Rhee's chief political lieutenant, Yi
 Ki-pung, who may have to step down as chief of the gov-
 erning Liberal party, is further weakening the administra-
 tion leadership.   These factors reduce the possibility of
 an orderly and constitutional succession when Rhee dies.

 NORTH AFRICA .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . Page
 Morocco and Tunisia are committed to support Al-
 gerian independence, but are beset by internal diffi-
 culties and apparently have given little more than lip
 service to their agreement of last June to coordinate
 foreign policies and collaborate closely in other
 spheres.   Tunisia's decision to join the Arab League,
 following similar action by Morocco, was more an ef-
 fort to avoid isolation from the rest of the Arab gov-
 ernments than a gesture of North African solidarity.
 A recent meeting  of the Maghreb Secretariat--composed
 of Algerian, Moroccan, and Tunisian political lead-
 ers--indicated only superficial harmony a on  the
 North African leaders.
 CYPRUS .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  . Page
 EOKA's announcement on 7 September of the termina-
 tion of its month-old, self-imposed "truce" may presage
 a resumption of terrorism on a major scale.   Greek and
 British officials expect all-out attacks by 1 October,
 when the British plan is to be implemented.   These at-
 tacks may include an attempt on the life of the Turkish
 representative appointed to advise Governor Foot or vio-
 lence against Turkish Cypriots in an effort to gain
 prompt UN intervention to "restore peace" on Cyprus.

 FRENCH CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . Page  8
 The new French constitution is virtually assured
 of approval on 28 September by a substantial majority
 of voters in metropolitan France, where most political
 leaders are rallying to support it;   in tropical Africa,
 where the option of independence has won it wide back-
 ing; and in Algeria, where the army is expected to get
 out a favorable vote.   Most of the traditional parties
 and the recently organized political groupings are now
 maneuvering with an eye to parliamentary elections
 which probably will be scheduled for November.

 ITALIAN GOVERNMENT PROBLEMS                                       Page
 When the Italian Chamber of Deputies convenes on
 16 September, Premier Fanfani's shaky coalition may
 be threatened by a financial scandal which allegedly
 involves members of his own Christian Democratic party.
 Fanfani is depending on his diplomatic initiatives in
 Middle Eastern affairs to bolster his government's pres-
 tige, but possible defections from right-wing Christian
 Democrats who object to his socio-economic reform pro-
 gram could deprive him of'his present three-vote ma-
 jority and force him to       broader parliamentary sup-            25X1

 CHILE'S PRESIDENTIAL CHOICE .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . Page 10
 Prominent Chilean industrialist Jorge Alessandri,who
 won a slim plurality over leftist candidate Allende
 in the 4 September presidential election, will probably
 be ratified by the Chilean Congress on 24 October.             He
 hopes to solve Chile's long-standing economic diffi-
 culties by a program of economic austerity and by re-
 storing competitive enterprise with a minimum of state
 intervention, but will  rob          uire substantial
 foreign aid.

 ENEZUELA      N     .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . Page 12
 The attempted military coup in Venezuela on 7 Sep-
 tember failed in part because the civilians' defense
 against a return to military rule was well organized
 and most of the divided armed forces continued their
 support of junta president Larrazabal.       An effective
 general strike on 8 September, in which the Communists
 were particularly active, further demonstrated civilian
 strength.   The military may still unite for a showdown,
 if it feels its role in the government is further en-
 dangered or if the  junta beconer                             aptive of periodic
 mob action.                                                            25X1

 Sino-Soviet bloc assistance to Indonesia has been
 marked this year by Djakarta's activation of the long-
 standing Soviet $100,000,000 economic credit, a Chinese
 Communist $40,000,000 loan, and an arms deal possibly
 amounting to as much as $200,000,000.   The aid is in
 the form of essential items, such as rice, textiles,
 ships,.and industrial machinery, and also provides for
 technicians, including military specialists.   Bloc

 trade promotion activities, reinforced with liberal

 ISRAEL AND THE MIDDLE EASTERN CRISES .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . Page  4
 Israel has reacted to the Middle East's latest
 crises with intensive diplomatic activity including
 consultations with French, British, and Italian gov-
 ernment leaders.   Israel is seeking late-model arma-
 ments and a guarantee of Israel's territorial integri-
 ty.                   Israel fears that Nasir's influence may be extended
 over Jordan and Lebanon.   Concern over such encirclement
 might lead the Israelis to take a military initiative
 at a time and place of their own choosing.
 POLISH ECONOMIC DEPENDENCE ON THE BLOC .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . Page 7
 The Soviet bloc accounted for 59 percent of Po-
 land's foreign trade in 1957, a figure which probably
 will not change significantly during the next two years.
 The extent of Warsaw's ties with the bloc puts the So-
 viet Union in a strong position to influence Polish ac-
 tions.   Basic political concessions probably could not
 be forced on the Polish Government through economic means
 alone, however, since Poland after first suffering consid-
 erable losses could reorient its economy from the bloc to

 BRAZIL'S FINANCIAL SITUATION ...  .  .  .  .  .  *  .  ,  .  .  .  .  . Page 10
 Brazil has undertaken a number of emergency meas-
 ures in recent weeks designed to head off a foreign ex-
 change crisis in 1959.   Even if these measures are fully
 carried out, Brazil will continue for some years to suf-
 fer severe balance-of-payments difficulties.   These dif-
 ficulties result from its continued dependence on the
 fluctuating coffee market for 60 to 70 percent of its
 exports and the increasing demands of its booming in-
 dustrial complex for imports of oil, machinery, and
 parts.   Repayments on foreign loans will require 15
 to 20 percent of export earnings for the next several             25X1

 The increasingly belliger-

 Communist leaders      and     Khru-
 shchev's blunt warning to the
 United States during the past
 week were intended to serve

 Bloc leaders are probably con-
 fident, however, that their
 tactics will enable  them to
 achieve progress toward politi-
 cal goals without major hostili-
 ties.
 Premier Chou En-lai, in
 agreeing on 6 September to a
 resumption of talks with the
 United States on the ambassado-
 rial level, reaffirmed Commu-
 nist China's "absolute right"
 to take the "necessary military
 action" against Chinese Nation-
 alist forces on the offshore
 islands.   On 7 September polit-
 buro member Peng Chen declared
 at the largest mass rally. ever
 held in Peiping. that China is
 "determined" to take Taiwan is
 well as the offshore islands.
 In the sharpest warning to
 date from Communist China, the
 People's Daily stated on 9 Sep-
 tember that convoying activity
 by American forces will place
 the United States in a "most
 precarious situation involving
 direct armed conflict with China
 at any moment."
 Khrushchev's letter of 7
 September to President Eisen-
 hower--the first official Soviet
 pronouncement on the present
 Taiwan Strait crisis--contained
 the strongest statement of So-
 viet support for the Chinese
 Communists to date. After point-
 edly warning against the danger
 of miscalculation, the Soviet
 premier declared:   "An attack
 on the Chinese People's Republic
 ...is an attack on the Soviet
 Union."  Although he did not
 specify the conditions under
 which the Soviet commitment would
 take effect or its precise form,

 sist Peiping with direct mili-

 in conversations with Asian dip-
 lomats, have also contributed
 to the picture of strengthened
 confidence which the bloc  is
 presenting to the world..,

 Nationalists, are also intended
 to assist attainment of politi-
 cal objectives.   In particular,
 the Communists probably feel
 that by further stimulating ap-
 prehension throughout the world
 over the prospect of large-scale
 hostilities, America's allies
 and neutral governments may be
 induced to bring pressure on
 the United States to avoid ac-
 tions which might lead to  a
 large-scale clash.
 Bloc leaders apparently are
 seeking to secure  a  greater
 voice for Communist China  in
 world affairs and its acceptance
 by other states as  a  "great
 power."  Other Communist polit-
 ical goals are to diminish Amer-
 ican prestige, discredit Amer-
 ican policy toward China, and
 to demoralize and weaken  the
 Nationalist regime in order to
 lay the groundwork for eventual
 acquisition of all Nationalist-
 held territory.
 Chou En-lai stated on 6
 September that Peiping is ready
 to resume  the  ambassadorial
 talks suspended last December.
 Two days later Mao Tse-tung made
 a firmer commitment to  resume
 the talks, and Ambassador Wang
 Ping-nan has left Peiping to re-
 turn to his post in Warsaw,
 evidently  prepared  to  begin
 negotiations.
 The Chinese decision has
 been underplayed  in the Commu-
 nist press, indicating that the
 Chinese leaders intend to sus-
 tain the atmosphere of crisis
 throughout China and maintain
 military as well as psychological
 pressures during the  prospec-
 tive negotiations.
 Communist China at the talks
 will probably demand the with-
 drawal of Chinese Nationalist
 troops from the offshore islands,
 particularly the Kinmen and Matsu
 islands.   Peiping's propaganda
 stresses the "immediate threat"
 posed  by  these  two  island
 groups and  places Taiwan and
 the Penghus in the category of
 territory which will be "re-
 stored sooner or later," sug-
 gescing that the Taiwan issue
 will not be pressed as force-
 fully at this time.
 Peiping's declaration on
 4 September extending its ter-
 ritorial waters to a distance
 of 12 miles was intended  to
 emphasize the proximity of the
 Kinmen and Matsu groups to the
 mainland; both are well within
 the new limit.
 The Chinese Communist nego-
 tiator will also propose that
 the discussions consider such
 questions as "American provoca-
 tions" and "invasion" of ter-
 ritorial waters.   In any event,
 Peiping will try to gain con-
 cessions, but will probably re-
 fuse to agree to any declaration
 or commitment which would com-
 promise its position that the
 "liberation" of Taiwan, as well
 as the offshore islands, is an
 "internal" problem.
 If the negotiations fail
 to progress, the Chinese Com-
 munists may propose that the
 ambassadors confine their ef-
 forts to a preliminary airing of
 views and the establishing of
 ground rules, and demand that
 substantive negotiations  be
 transferred to the foreign min-
 ister level or to a heads-of-
 government meeting with Chinese
 Communist participation.  Khru-
 shchev hinted on 7 September
 that he may call for high-level
 negotiations  by  the  United
 States,  the   USSR, Communist
 China, and "other countries" on
 ways of resolving the crisis
 through "common efforts."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 11 September 1958
 Peiping's ambassador in
 Warsaw, Wang Ping-nan, will con-
 tinue in the role assigned to
 him in 1955 as negotiator for
 the Chinese side.   A protegd of
 Chou En-lai,  Wang is considered
 one of Peiping.'s top diplomatic
 technicians and has been used
 for many years as a contact man
 with foreigners.
 Military Developments
 The Communists could con-
 centrate about 100 torpedo boats
 near the offshore islands within
 48 hours.   Landing craft have
 been collecting in the strait
 area which,  in conjunction with
 the 5,000 or more junks already
 present, give the Chinese Com-
 munists the capability to quick-
 ly assemble sufficient
 sea lift for an as-
 sault on the offshore
 islands.
 On 8 September
 12 MIG's clashed with
 12 'Nationalist F-86F
 jets
 (Na-
 tionalists claim that
 five MIG's were shot
 down and two were dam-
 aged in the resulting
 engagement with one
 F-86F damaged.   Al-
 though some F-86's
 are now equipped with
 Sidewinder air-to-air
 missiles, they were
 not involved in this
 Bombardment of the Kinmen
 Islands group was light on 5,
 6, and 7 September, but the Com-
 munists fired about 50,000 rounds
 on 8 September in what they
 termed a punitive bombardment;
 the firing continued through 11
 September but at a reduced level.
 Command and supply facilities
 and US-escorted Nationalist con-
 voys continued to be the prin-
 cipal targets for Communist fire.
 Nationalist Developments
 Many high-level Chinese Na-
 tionalists fear'that any renun-
 ciation of the use of force in
 the Taiwan Strait area by Pei-
 ping and Washington would indef-
 initely defer a showdown fight
 with the Communists which they
 have anticipated might grow out
 of the offshore islands situation.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 11 September 1958
 These Nationalists have been
 dismayed by the American offer
 to resume negotiations with Com-
 munist China, and they may try
 to take provocative actions,
 such as air attacks on Commu-
 nist airfields and artillery
 positions,  in an attempt to ex-
 pand the area of conflict to
 the mainland.
 estimated 30 to 60 days in ma-
 jor items.   There are no crit-
 ical shortages yet, and damage
 to Nationalist supply dumps by
 artillery fire has been negli-
 gible.   The Nationalists have
 initiated air drops but their
 logistical capability is in-
 sufficient to resupply the
 Kinmens by this means.
 Taipei's public line con-
 tends that a Communist assault
 on the offshore islands is im-
 minent.   An indication that the
 real estimate of the Foreign
 Ministry differs has been re-
 vealed by the Nationalist mili-
 tary attache in Ankara.   He told
 the American naval attachd there
 that the Foreign Ministry had
 informed its embassies that Com-
 munist intentions regarding the
 offshore islands were political
 rather than military.
 Chinese Nationalist han-
 dling of the resupply convoys
 to the Kinmens on 7 and 8 Sep-
 tember was marked by lack of
 coordination and preparedness
 at the beaches by the Kinmen
 Defense Command.   Neither con-
 voy unloaded all of its sup-
 plies,  and an LSM was lost from
 the second convoy.   No smoke
 screen was laid to shield the
 landing ships on the beach, and
 counterbattery fire suffered
 from improper positioning of
 Nationalist guns as well as lack
 of precise knowledge of the Com-
 munist gun positions.
 Another major resupply at-
 tempt was made on 11 September,
 when two convoys were sent from
 Taiwan.    The first,  consisting
 of an escort vessel,  two tugs,
 and three landing ships,  suc-
 cessfully evacuated wounded,  but
 the second convoy,  which was to
 land supplies,  was driven off
 by artillery fire from the main-
 land.
 Supplies now available on
 the Kinmens are adequate for an
 Free-World Reaction
 Free-world reaction to re-
 cent developments in the Taiwan
 Strait situation was predominat-
 ly one of relief at the prospect
 of negotiations, although there
 was no expectation that any
 permanent solution  would  be
 achieved.   Chou's offer to nego-
 tiate was attributed by many
 Western observers to US "firm-
 ness," but there continues to
 be strong opposition to any
 American military action to pre-
 serve the status quo of the is-
 lands.   The threatening tone of
 Khrushchev's letter to President
 Eisenhower was roundly condemned.
 The British Government ap-
 pears increasingly apprehensive
 at the prospect that the United
 States intends to defend the off-
 shore islands, as most influen-
 tial British opinion doubts their
 importance to free-world securi-
 ty.   Opposition leader Gaitskell,
 assuming emphatic labor and Lib-
 eral opposition to American poli-
 cy,believes the government may
 have serious trouble in holding
 its own supporters.
 Comment from other NATO
 countries has generally been fa-
 vorable,                                                               and Greek,  Turkish,  and
 West German officials have ap-
 proved the firm line taken by
 the United States as necessary
 to free-world security.
 In line with President
 Nasir's accusation of "direct
 aggression" by the United States,
 the Cairo press continues to
 support Peiping's case,  holding

 the United States responsible
 and giving Khrushchev's warn-
 ing full play.
 Southeast Asian governments
 have  reacted  with          moderation
 and along expected lines.   South
 Vietnam and the Philippines have
 expressed the hope for continued
 American firmness.           Burma has
 drafted a policy statement de-
 ploring the use of force in the
 strait as a violation of the
 Five Principles, and has pri-
 vately indicated that it wel-
 comed resistance to further
 Chinese  Communist  expansion.
 Indonesia, declaring it was
 "not neutral" on the China is-
 sue, has reasserted its recog-
 nition of Peiping.                     Cambodian
 Prince Sihanouk, without com-
 mitting his country, has acted
 as a publicist for the Chinese
 Communist leaders' statements.
 Indian Prime Minister Nehru
 on 7 September reiterated sup-
 port for Peiping's claim to the
 offshore islands, but urged that
 the matter be solved peacefully.
 Several leading Indian papers
 have criticized Peiping's bel-
 licosity.
 The prospect of resumed
 ambassadorial talks was warmly
 applauded in Japan, although
 Foreign Ministry sources are
 pessimistic over-chances of
 agreement.  The  Tokyo  press
 criticized Khrushchev's letter
 to President Eisenhower as "men-
 acing, unrealistic, and unhelp-
 ful."
 UN Representation Issue
 Prior to the present crisis
 in the Taiwan Strait, a majority
 of UN members seemed ready to
 keep Taipei in the Chinese seat
 at the General Assembly session
 opening on 16 September.  Recent
 events, however, may lead many
 members to reassess their pol-
 icies in order  to bring UN in-
 fluence to bear on the situation.
 Peiping's previous attempts
 to gain China's seat in the UN
 have met with little response,
 largely because no formula for
 the future of Taiwan has been
 presented which is sufficiently
 attractive to weaken Western
 support for Taipei.   National-
 ist China's seat in the UN has
 been upheld for the past six
 years by the moratorium device--
 which postpones substantive
 discussion of the question and
 requires only a simple majority
 vote.  Most UN members, however,
 believe Peiping must eventually
 be admitted and have supported
 the moratoriur largely on grounds
 of expediency.   Taipei's majori-
 ties have decreased each year.
 At this session,  India for
 the third time will ask the
 General Assembly to discuss the
 issue substantively.   An actual
 vote on which of the two Chinas
 should be seated would require
 a  two-thirds majority--which
 neither Taipei nor Peiping seems
 at this point likely to attain.
 Such a vote, however, would re-
 quire UN members to choose openly
 for the first time between the
 two governments.
 Even if the General Assem-
 bly should support Taipei at the
 beginning of this session,: it
 could reopen the question at
 any time.  Nationalist China's
 UN membership could be seriously
 jeopardized by any action by
 Taipei to provoke hostilities
 involving the United States or
 a diplomatic offensive by Peiping,
 particularly if in response to
 any UN efforts to ensure peace
 in the area.

 MIDDLE EAST DEVELOPMENTS
 Despite the easing since
 4 September of the rebel-en-
 forced general strike, most op-
 position forces in Lebanon still
 stress that the rebellion will
 continue until their demands
 for political "reform" are met
 by the government to be installed
 by President-elect Shihab on 24
 September.   The gradual lifting
 of the strike reportedly re-
 sulted from Shihab's agreement
 to several opposition demands,
 possibly including appointment
 of Tripoli rebel leader Rashid
 Karame as prime  minister in
 the next cabinet.   The opposi-
 tion also insists that Shihab
 after inauguration take steps
 to amend the constitution to
 limit presidential powers.
 Factional squabbling has
 broken out among the  rebels,
 primarily as a result of unwill-
 ingness on the part of the ex-
 tremists to cooperate with the
 rebel majority in making a ges-
 ture which would enable Shihab
 to expedite the withdrawal of
 American troops.
 pro-Chamoun extremists may at-
 tempt to prolong the crisis in
 order to prevent the withdrawal
 of American forces.   By the re-
 cent formation of the National
 Liberal  party,   Chamoun  has
 created a personal   political
 organization with which he hopes
 to continue participation in
 Lebanese affairs after he leaves
 the presidency on 23 September.

 Meanwhile, dissatisfaction among
 some army officers with the pro-

 of plotting to organize a coun-

 beset by increasing unemployment
 and labor unrest.

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 USSR SCHEDULES 21ST PARTY CONGRESS FOR JANUARY
 The Soviet party central
 committee decided in a plenary
 session on 5 September to con-
 vene an "extraordinary" 21st
 party congress on 27 January.
 The only item on the agenda,
 discussion led by Khrushchev
 on the goals for the economy
 under the Seven-Year Plan (1959-
 65), will be based on a set of
 "theses" to be published prior
 to the congress.   Although long
 provided for in the party stat-
 utes, an "extraordinary" con-
 gress is unique in Soviet histo-
 ry.  The forthcoming session
 has probably been designated
 as "extraordinary" because it
 has been called to discuss one
 special topic instead of an ar-
 ray of problems facing the par-
 ty.  According to the statutes,
 an ordinary congress would have
 been convened not later than
 February 1960.
 The only other business an-
 nounced  by the one-day plenum
 was the removal  of  former
 Premier Bulganin  from  the
 presidium.
 The party congress will
 not necessarily be limited to
 its agenda.   It may change the
 membership of the central com-
 mittee, which in turn may affect
 the composition of the party
 presidium and secretariat in
 such a way as to further Khru-
 shchev's political dominance.
 Besides the failure to pub-
 lish the plan before now, there
 are other suggestions of high-
 level conflict over the growth
 capabilities of the USSR.   This
 might explain the decision to
 issue more flexible and tenta-
 tive "theses" for public discus-
 sion prior to the party congress
 rather  than  the  traditional
 "draft directives."  This possi-
 ble conflict may involve the
 rate of improvement in living
 standards.   If the 1955-57 an-
 nual rate of increase in total
 investment (13 percent) is not
 maintained, as seems likely, the
 continuation of an annual 10-
 percent rate  of  industrial
 growth--which the leadership ap-
 pears determined to maintain--
 may require that the necessary
 additional funds, materials, and
 labor for industrial expansion
 be diverted from housing and
 other consumer-oriented invest-
 ment.   Khrushchev may bow to
 this necessity in order to "catch
 up" with the West more quickly.
 The "theses" may put forth
 new proposals, possibly includ-
 ing increased authority over in-
 vestment funds for the regional
 economic councils, modifications
 of prices and pricing systems,
 and perhaps additional changes
 in agricultural organization.
 In any case, one theme of the
 congress will be the continuing
 high rate of socialist economic
 growth compared with that of
 capitalism, and particularly
 the fast  rate "at  which the
 USSR  will be  overtaking  the
 United    States"         e next
 seven     years.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY PUMMARY
 11 September 1958
 EAST GERMANY CONCERNED OVER REFUGEE FLIGHTS TO WEST
 East German       officials are
 greatly concerned over the mass
 refugee flights to West Germany
 which have continued despite
 severe control measures in East
 Germany and East Berlin.   The
 current exodus--highlighted by
 the escape of leading German in-
 tellectuals--apparently results
 from the relentless implementa-
 tion of new hard-line policies
 in the cultural and economic
 fields and an apparent belief
 that no diminution in political
 oppression or improvement in
 living standards is in the off-
 ing.
 Some 4,300 refugees reached
 West Berlin during the week end-
 ing 2 September--a seasonal
 peak--while in approximately the
 same period more than 1,800 fled
 over the interzonal border to
 REFUGEES REPORTING TO
 WEST BERLIN AND WEST GERMANY
 West Germany.   This brings the
 total number of escapees to more
 than 140,000 during the first
 eight months of 1958; more than
 two million persons have fled
 East Germany since mid-1949. The
 total number of refugees since
 1 January falls below the 1957
 figure of 166,000 for the cor-
 responding period but includes
 a much higher proportion of es-
 sential "brainworkers"--doctors,
 scientists, technicians, and
 teachers--many of whom are re-
 ported to be party members.
 Moreover, this total includes
 more-'than 10,000 males of mili-
 tary age--the equivalent of one
 line division.
 As East German authorities
 have intensified security meas-
 ures along the interzonal border
 between East and West Germany,
 a much larger proportion of es-
 capees have fled through West
 Berlin than in past years.   In
 August almost 65 percent came
 into this city, whereas until
 this summer approximately 50
 percent crossed the interzonal
 frontier.
 The East German Government
 believes it cannot permit the
 country "to bleed to death through'
 the refugee flow," but East Ger-
 man officials appear to be in a
 quandary over what measures to adopt.
 Party boss Walter Ulbricht re-
 portedly favors taking even
 harsher steps to cut down on
 travel between East and West Ber-

 the Bundestag reconvenes on 1
 October for its traditional
 opening session in West Berlin.
 Such a resolution would empha-
 size the injustice that forces
 the refugees to leave their
 homes.   A part of the West Ger-
 man press has demanded that Bonn
 bring the issue to the United
 Nations.   Christian Democratic
 officials, however, feel it is
 important not to promote fur-
 ther unrest in the Soviet Zone.
 The continuing heavy in-
 flux of refugees into West Ber-
 lin has strained reception fa
 cilities, and some West German
 states have become reluctant to
 accept their refugee quotas.
 In response to appeals from West
 Berlin authorities, Bonn has    25X1
 ordered evacuation flights of
 refugee
 The sudden sharp drop in
 the number of refugees entering
 West Berlin in the week ending
 9 September--3,128, a decrease
 of 1,204 from the preceding
 week--may have been due in part
 to the spreading   in  East Ger

 A campaign is under way
 in Czechoslovakia to popularize
 wage reform measures and work
 norm revisions which will af-
 fect approximately two million
 industrial workers.   The regime
 hopes to lower costs and 'in-
 crease industrial output by
 raising labor productivity pro-
 portionately more than wages
 and by redistributing wage funds
 among workers.  The reform, to
 be fully in effect by 1960, is
 closely, allied to the reorgani-
 zation of industry and planning
 now under way.  While the regime
 plans to institute reforms
 cautiously, any rise in work
 norms is bound to antagonize
 labor and could hamper the re-
 gime's program for continued
 economic expansion.
 Czechoslovakia will suffer
 a declining rate of growth for
 industrial production unless
 extraordinary measures are taken
 to increase labor productivity.
 Czech wage funds have advanced
 faster than labor productivity
 in recent years, but the regime
 now plans to reverse this ratio
 by cutting into the worker's
 share of the growing gross
 national product and diverting
 these funds to capital invest-
 ment.   Because of the relatively
 few additions to the labor
 force, the regime has for some
 time drawn on marginal labor--
 for   example, women and pen-
 sioners, who have relatively
 high absentee rates--but such
 labor raises production costs.
 During the past year, as
 part of a scheme for reorganiz-
 ing industry, administrative
 personnel have been dismissed
 in large numbers and salary
 schedules for such personnel as
 were retained, as well as for
 technicians and engineers, have
 been revised: basic payments
 were raised and bonuses dras-
 tically curtailed.   The average
 take-home pay is now roughly,
 the same as previously, but the
 total number of workers is few-
 er, with a resultant lower total

 salary bill to the regime. It
 was hoped that discharged per-
 sonnel could be channeled into
 production jobs where they were
 needed, but in this the regime
 admits only limited success to
 date.
 The wage reform for indus-
 trial workers, originally to be
 experimentally introduced in
 selected enterprises next month
 but apparently already under
 way, will similarly raise basic
 payments but reduce bonuses..
 from about 50 to 15 percent of
 take-home pay without lowering
 average wages, according to the
 regime.
 An accompanying comprehen-
 sive change in the system of
 job classifications and work
 norms will,  however,  lower take-
 home pay for some workers while
 it raises that of others, be-
 cause present wage schedules
 are "out of date" and the in-
 dividual workers are often com-
 pensated far above the value
 of work performed.   In addition,
 the reform will re-evaluate
 wage schedules according to the
 branch of industry in order to
 ensure greater compensation for
 workers in "priority" industries
 such as mining and metallurgy.
 Even though the absolute
 wages of most Czech workers are
 not lowered, as the regime c
 claims, workers will in the long
 run be working more for the same
 amount of money under the system
 of higher work norms, and this
 gradual speed-up will become in-
 creasingly apparent to the work-
 ers.   Reportedly, passive re-
 sistance has already occurred
 in one factory in Pilzen, where
 elements of the wage reform were
 introduced and where reassigned
 administrative personnel were
 obliged to work for wages con-
 siderably below their previous
 salaries.
 The combination of an un-
 popular increase in norms and
 a knot of disgruntled former
 white-collar workers in the
 factories poses a threat to re-
 25X1
 gime hopes of increasing  ro-
 duction  by there r f orms.

 Premier  Sihanouk seems
 likely to become even more un-
 compromising than in the past
 in handling Cambodia's border
 and other disputes with neigh-
 boring South Vietnam and Thai-
 land.   Sihanouk is en route to
 New York for the regular session
 of the United Nations General
 Assembly, where he may try to
 portray "small, neutral" Cambo-
 dia as the aggrieved victim of
 the "militant" Vietnamese and
 Thais.   Phnom Penh's ignoring
 of an offer by Saigon to re-
 move the controversial boundary
 marker erected by Vietnamese
 troops last June inside the old
 Cambodian frontier indicates
 Sihanouk is unwilling to dispose
 readily of this handy symbol of
 Vietnamese "expansionism."

 essentially to deflate any Cam-
 bodian charges at the United
 Nations of Vietnam's unyielding
 attitude.
 Despite Sihanouk'.s praise
 of the Peiping regime's economic
 progress and general policies,
 he remains opposed to the spread
 of Communist influence within
 Cambodia.   However, subversive
 inroads are already perceptible
 as a result of Cambodia's eco-
 nomic and political contacts
 with the Sino-Soviet bloc.   For
 example,  the Cambodian Informa-
 tion Ministry and the local
 press have become orientated to
 the left, while Communist in-
 fluence among the nation's youth
 and the influential Overseas
 Chinese population is a growing
 problem for the government.
 There is considerable danger
 that Sihanouk may accelerate
 this trend by attempting to use
 Peiping as a counterweight to
 Saigon and Bangkok.

 The relatively moderate
 reaction in South Korea to the
 Taiwan'.Strait developments con-
 trasts with the lively interest
 shown in the Indonesian situa-
 tion last May, when government-
 staged demonstrations called for
 "volunteers" to aid the insur-
 gents.   The present attitude may
 in part result from President
 Rhee's waning dynamism and grad-
 ual withdrawal from day-to-day
 politics.   The development of a
 critical void in the adminis-
 tration leadership is further
 suggested by the possibility
 that Rhee's chief political
 lieutenant, Yi Ki-pung, may have
 to step down as leader of the
 governing Liberal
 party because
 of poor health.
 Yi's political effective-
 ness
 has been at a low
 ebb since
 May
 and a recent rest
 apparently
 has
 failed to restore
 his physi-
 cal
 and mental vigor.
 Should Yi
 be forced to withdraw, it might
 set the stage for an internal
 power struggle which could re-
 duce the possibility of an order-
 ly and constitutional succession
 when Rhee dies.
 The lack of leadership
 evidenced by the uncoordinated
 Liberal party efforts to over-
 come Democratic party obstruc-
 tionist tactics in the recent
 National Assembly session may
 have resulted in part from Yi's
 poor health.  Also, he has not
 assumed the added responsibili-
 ties necessary to fill the gap
 left in the Liberal leadership
 last June when a number of his
 experienced subordinates were
 replaced by less able politicians;
 as the result of factional maneu-
 vering.
 Rhee's numerous purges of
 subordinate political leaders in
 the past will make it difficult-
 to find a qualified successor to
 Yi.   Most of the possible can-
 didates are obviously incompe

 Ambassador Dowling feels the
 only obvious alternatives to Yi
 are aged  incompetents         under
 whose leadership party organ-

 Korean politicians are not

 Tunisia's decision to join
 the Arab League,  following simi-
 lar action by Morocco, was more
 an effort to avoid isolation
 than a gesture of North African
 solidarity.     A meeting from 30
 August to l September of the
 Maghreb Secretariat--composed
 of Algerian, Moroccan, and Tuni-
 sian political leaders--,indi-
 cated only superficial harmony
 among North Africans.   Morocco
 and Tunisia are committed to
 support Algerian independence,
 but are beset by internal dif-
 ficulties and apparently have
 given little more than lip serv-
 ice to their agreement of last
 June to coordinate foreign pol-
 icies.
 Under strong pressure from
 the left wing of the dominant
 Istiqlal party, the moderate
 Moroccan Government was ap-
 parently persuaded during the
 recent visit of Iraqi Foreign
 Minister Joumard of the advan-
 tages of Arab solidarity.
 The Moroccan decision to
 join the league was made with-
 out consulting Tunisia.   Presi-
 dent Bourguiba is annoyed with
 Morocco's action but nonethe-
 less considered that Tunisia
 could not afford to remain out-
 side the league.   He seems to
 hope Tunisia can exert a moderat-
 ing , influence,  a possibility
 which might be enhanced if Tuni-
 sia is elected to the UN Securi-
 ty Council.   Bourguiba has been
 outspokenly anti-Nasir and his
 relations with the UAR probably
 will not improve materially with
 league membership, as he will
 continue to combat' Egyptian sub-
 version in Tunisia.
 The Maghreb Secretariat
 meeting in Tunis was apparently
 only superficially concerned
 with major policy issues.   It
 seems to.have directed its ef-
 forts primarily toward drafting
 a final communique denouncing
 the French constitutional ref-
 erendum and announcing agreement
 to collaborate during the forth-
 coming UN debate on Algeria.  It
 made no progress toward forming
 a Maghreb Consultative Assembly,
 desired by the FLN, and scheduled
 another meeting for Rabat on 6
 October.
 Probably dissatisfied
 with the lack of substantive
 progress at Tunis,  the FLN may
 be weighing the possibility of
 overriding Moroccan-Tunisian
 objections and declaring its
 executive committee--reorganized
 along governmental lines some
 months  ago--to    be  the pro-
 visional government  of   an
 Algerian republic.   It would
 then seek membership in the
 Arab League.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 11 September 1958
 EOKA's announcement on 7
 September of the termination of
 its month-old, self-imposed
 "truce" on Cyprus follows a re-
 cent increase in clashes between
 EOKA and the security forces.
 It may presage a resumption of
 terrorism on a major scale.
 Both Greek and British offi-
 cials expect all-out attacks
 on the British by 1 October
 when Turkey's official repre-
 sentative, appointed to advise
 Governor Foot as the first step
 in implementing the new British
 plan for Cyprus, is expected to
 arrive in Nicosia.   Turkish par-
 ticipation in the administra-
 tion of the island--even on a
 consultative basis--is violent-
 ly opposed by Greek-Cypriot
 leaders as well as the govern-
 ment of Greece as a move toward
 partition and violation of the
 Treaty of Lausanne.
 In addition to stepping :up
 its attacks on the British,EOKA
 may launch attacks against Turk-
 ish                    Cypriots or make an attempt
 on the life of the Turkish rep-
 resentative.   Attacks against
 the Turks would embroil EOKA in
 fighting on two fronts, but the
 Greek Cypriots might deem them
 necessary in order to obtain  _
 prompt UN intervention to "re-
 store peace" on Cyprus.                      Arch-
 bishop Makarios on 28 August
 called on the UN to intervene
 for that purpose.   An attempt
 on the life of the Turkish rep-
 resentative or new intercommunal
 violence on Cyprus would also
 lead to a severe crisis in rela-
 tions between Greece and Turkey,
 Greek Foreign Minister Aver-
 off favors breaking diplomatic
 relations with Britain and Tur-
 key acid possibly withdrawing
 from NATO if the British plan
 is implemented.   Averoff has
 been warning for some time that
 Greece must  make  "drastic
 changes" in its foreign policy
 if the Cyprus issue is not re-
 solved along lines acceptable
 to Athens,  but his views may be
 modified by Premier Karamanlis.
 Governor Foot recently
 visited London for discussions
 which concerned in part the pos-
 sible return of  the  exiled
 Makarios to Cyprus.   Makarios
 has previously been forbidden
 to return until all violence
 ceased on Cyprus for an extended
 period of time. A change in
 the British attitude toward his
 return would be based on the hope
 that his presence could be used
 to restrain EOKA.   Recent state-
 ments by Makarios indicate, how-
 ever,   that  he   remains   ada-
 mant in  his      opposition to the
 British plan for    Cyprus, and
 his return to   the island  at
 this time might not lead' to
 an end  of violence.
 The new French constitu-
 tion is virtually assured of ap-
 proval in the 28 September ref-
 erendum as most political lead-
 ers in metropolitan France and
 France's overseas possessions
 rally to back it.   Socialist
 leader Guy Mollet's plea for
 broad support to thwart any
 rightist claim to "an exclusive.
 mandate to build a new France"
 is expected to swing his party,
 which will adopt an official
 stand at its 11-14 September
 party congress.   Most of the
 leaders at the Radical party
 congress, meeting during the
 same period, are also expected
 to back De Gaulle.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 11 September 1958
 The Popular Republicans
 have already voted to back the
 constitution, and most right-of-
 center leaders, despite reserva-
 tions, will do the same.   Ex-
 treme rightist Poujade and his
 Peasant party ally Antier, how-
 ever, are opposed.   Practically
 all of the dozen or so new po-
 litical groups support the con-
 stitution except Daniel Mayer's
 leftist Union of Democratic
 Forces and General Chassin's
 rightist organization of "Com-
 mittees of Public Safety," which
 may have ties with Poujade and
 Antier.
 In view of De Gaulle's
 last-minute revisions in the
 text of the constitution to rec-
 ognize the right of overseas
 territories to opt for independ-
 ence, it now appears likely that
 the territories will vote fa-
 vorably.   A large favorable ma-
 jority seems assured in Algeria
 despite De Gaulle's deliberate
 vagueness concerning the area's
 future, which has disgruntled
 many settlers, and despite con-
 tinuing FLN efforts to force
 Moslem abstention.
 The Communists. will provide
 the most active opposition, but
 minority leaders in both Social-
 ist and Radical circles are also
 expected to campaign against De
 Gaulle.   They.argue that the
 referendum has become a plebi-
 scite on De Gaulle rather than
 on the merits of the proposed
 constitution, which they con-
 sider too authoritarian.  Wheth-
 er they succeed in rallying a
 sizable negative "republican"
 vote or not, Pierre Mendes-France,
 Christian Pineau, and Daniel
 Mayer will probably form the
 nucleus for a new political
 grouping in the subsequent par-
 liamentary elections.  They will
 try to consolidate the non-Com-
 munist left in the hope of de-
 veloping a loyal opposition.
 On the right, three of the
 new political formations, in-
 cluding Information Minister
 Soustelle's Union for the Res-
 toration  of  France,   have com-
 bined under the leadership of
 the  secretary  of  the Gaull-

 ITALIAN GOVERNMENT PROBLEMS
 When the Italian Chamber
 of Deputies convenes on 16 Sep-
 tember, Premier Fanfani's shaky
 coalition may be threatened by
 a financial scandal which al-
 legedly involves members of his
 own Christian Democratic party.
 Fanfani is depending on foreign
 issues to bolster his govern"
 ment's prestige, but may have
 to seek broader parliamentary
 support.
 Finance Minister Preti, a
 Democratic Socialist, is press-
 ing an investigation of "Bankers
 Anonymous," a financial group
 which has been engaged for eight
 years in "administering" huge
 sums contributed by small in-
 vestors who received from 30
 to 100 percent interest on their
 investment.   The Republican
 party--on whose abstention the
 government depends for its three-
 vote majority--charges through
 its newspaper that the treasury
 minister, a right-wing Christian
 Democrat, and a Catholic Action
 leader are also involved.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 11 September 1958
 THE ABORTIVE MILITARY COUP IN VENEZUELA
 The failure of a military
 coup attempt in Venezuela on 7
 September demonstrates the ef-
 fectiveness of civilian strength
 as a check against a return to
 military rule and  continuing
 support by most of the divided
 armed forces for junta presi-
 dent Larrazabal.                   A  general
 strike of 8 September, in which
 the Communists were particular-
 ly active, ended when the junta
 acceded  to  demands  that the
 coup  leaders be punished.   Nei-
 ther the civilian nor the mili-
 tary elements appear satisfied
 with the junta's  handling of
 the situation. The armed forces
 may still face a showdown with
 civilian elements over control
 of the government, perhaps even
 before the scheduled November
 elections.
 The abortive revolt was
 quickly suppressed, but fight-
 ing between civilians and the
 military rebels resulted in
 several casualties in Caracas.
 The action was led by officers
 allegedly involved with former
 Defense Minister Castro Leon,
 who was reportedly planning a
 coup at the time of his ouster
 from the cabinet on 23 July.
 The attempt climaxed a period
 of tension over the recent re-
 assignment of the chief of the
 Combined Staff, a close asso-
 ciate of Castro.
 The elaborate civilian or-
 ganization, which called the
 strike on 8, September, has been
 developed since the ouster of
 dictator Perez last January
 primarily to guard against the
 continuing threat of a military
 coup and to ensure the restora-
 tion of constitutional govern-
 ment.                                                        It includes political,
 student, and labor groups, some
 of which are armed and most of
 which can be mobilized rapidly
 for a general strike or similar
 display of force.   The respon-
 sible leaders in this civilian
 structure, however, may not in
 the future be able to exercise
 control over the radical ele-
 ments, which could convert the
 organization into an instru-
 ment of violence.
 The armed forces, divided
 among themselves, have been re-
 luctant to use force  against
 civilians to bolster their wan-
 ing political power,  because
 such action would probably lead
 to widespread unrest or possi-
 bly civil war.   The military may
 still unite for a showdown if
 it feels its role in government
 is further endangered -or 'if' the
 junta becomes a captive of peri-
 odic mob action.
 Moreover,  in the present
 atmosphere :charged with tension
 and rumor, armed civilian groups
 might provoke serious incidents
 with the military, which is be-
 coming a symbol of reaction in
 the public mind.   Meanwhile,
 any breakdown in the political
 unity program, endorsed by all
 parties but now under consider-
 able strain, is likely to en-
 courage  continued                                                                  military
 plotting.

 'PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 BLOC ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN INDONESIA
 The Sino-Soviet bloc has
 extended liberal assistance to
 Indonesia this year, particular-
 ly a Soviet $100,000,000 eco-
 nomic credit, a Chinese Commu-
 nist $40,000,000.loan, and an
 arms deal possibly amounting
 to as much as $200,000,000. The
 aid is in the form of essential
 items, such as rice, textiles,
 ships,  and industrial machinery,
 and also  provides ' for .tech-
 nicians,                      including military
 specialists.  Bloc trade pro-
 motion activities,  reinforced
 with liberal credit offers,
 probably will result
 in an increase in
 bloc-Indonesian trade
 in 1958 to above the
 1955 peak of $74,
 000,000.
 Economic Aid
 The Soviet $100,-
 000,000 economic
 loan, offered first
 in 1956, was not ac-
 cepted until early
 this year.   In March
 and April, ten So-
 viet cargo vessels
 costing about $11,-
 500,000 were pur-
 chased under the
 loan and, subsequent-
 ly,  two tankers cost-
 ing about $3,300,000.
 Other Soviet commit-
 ments under the cred-
 it include a foreign
 exchange loan of
 $25,000,000,  textiles
 worth $600,000, and
 possibly the sale of some fish-
 ing trawlers estimated at about
 $12,600,000.   A highway which
 has been surveyed by Soviet
 technicians may be constructed
 in Borneo at an estimated cost
 of $8,000,000 for the machinery
 alone.
 In addition to the $100,-
 000,000 loan,  the USSR has of-
 fered to carry out a mineral
 and uranium survey for Indonesia
 and to exploit any deposits
 found.   It has also offered to
 cooperate  with Djakarta on a
 research program for developing
 peaceful uses for atomic energy
 and to aid  the  country's ed-
 ucational system with $10,000,-
 000 worth of projects.   .Indo-.

 Poland.
 Aside,.from these offers of
 assistance to the Indonesian
 Government, Moscow has offered
 to extend unlimited credit with
 easy repayment terms to private
 organizations.   As a-result,
 a $2,500,000 glass factory is
 under construction near Djakarta
 and another firm has signed a
 contract  for   the  delivery
 of $800,000 worth of electrical
 equipment.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 11 September 1958
 Of the $40,000,000 econom-
 ic aid offer from Communist
 China, $11,200,000 is being
 used to import 20,000 tons of
 rice and 74,000,000 yards of
 textiles.  The proceeds from
 the sale of these goods are'to
 be used for meeting local con-
 struction costs incurred in the
 building of textile factories.
 The purchase of factory equip-
 ment is to be financed under
 the remainder of the Chinese
 credit.   Peiping, in addition,
 has offered to purchase  oil
 from the North Sumatran fields,
 The European satellites
 also are contributing to the
 bloc's economic program in In-
 donesia.   Poland contracted in
 June to deliver to Indonesia
 during the next three years 24
 ships worth an estimated $39,-
 000,000, under a  liberal 13-
 year credit  with a 2-percent
 down  payment.  East  Germany
 completed in June a $7,900,000
 sugar refinery at Jogjakarta,
 which, because of several break-
 downs, is not expected to be
 in operation until 1959. Other
 East German offers of credit
 in the fields of mining, road
 building, shipping, and commer-
 cial air lines have been made.
 Czechoslovakia is probably
 the most active of the European
 satellites in efforts to develop
 a wide,  variety  of  economic
 contacts in Indonesia.   It has
 completed construction   of a
 small enamelware factory in
 Djakarta and'is-financing under
 a five-year credit the Brantas
 irrigation canal project  now
 under construction in east-cen-
 tral Java.   A $1,500,000 rubber-
 tire factory in Djakarta built
 by Czech engineers is scheduled
 to open soon.  A $4,900,000 con-
 tract for equipment to generate
 hydroelectric power was signed
 in April 1958 and additional
 contracts are expected to fol-
 low shortly.                  In addition to
 these projects, Prague has ex-
 tended several other offers, in-
 cluding construction of a $25,-
 000,000 thermopower  plant, a
 $6,000,000-power plant, and a
 $4,500,000 tractor deal.
 The Communist bloc  con-
 cluded arms deals with Indonesia
 early this year amounting to at
 least $100,000,000 and possibly
 as much as $200,000,000.   The
 Indonesian Government has stated
 that its arms mission was given
 the authority to purchase up to
 $250,000,000 worth of arms--
 $50,000,000 for the army and
 $100,000,000 each for the air
 force and the navy.
 The army group apparently
 purchased about $20,000,000
 worth of hardware in  Poland
 and Czechoslovakia.   In 1957
 the army and air force together
 purchased 4,000 jeeps from the
 USSR at a cost of over $7,000,-
 000.
 The air force contingent
 met its requirements within the
 bloc--allegedly in Czechoslovakia
 --purchasing aircraft and sup-
 plementary equipment  worth
 about $63,000,000--about 35 MIG-
 17 jet fighters, 20 to 30 IL-28  25X1
 jet bombers, 20 IL-14 transports,25X1
 20 MIG-15 jet trainers, and

 with offers of liberal credit
 to both government and private
 organizations.   Bloc trade was
 small in 1957, however, amount-
 ing to only $68,000,000, about
 4 percent of Indonesia's total
 foreign trade.   Communist China's
 share of  the bloc's trade with
 Indonesia rose to about 78 per-
 cent last year.   Trade with the
 USSR in 1957 was only about 1
 percent of total bloc trade,
 but this trade has increased
 this year.
 Trade agreements are being
 renegotiated with some of the
 European satellites.   One was
 signed with  Czechoslovakia
 in  May  and another   was con-
 cluded  with Poland  in August.
 Delegations  from Communist

 North Vietnam recently pur-
 chased  at least $500,000 worth
 of  Indonesian  rubber for
 transshipment  to Eastern
 Europe.   It is  probable  that
 bloc   trade with  Indonesia
 in  1958  will  rise  above-
 the  previous                                                           $74,000,000     peak

 ISRAEL AND THE MIDDLE EASTERN CRISES
 Israel has reacted to the
 Middle East's latest  crises
 with intensive diplomatic ac-
 tivity involving  conferences
 between Foreign Minister Golda
 Moir and French, British, and
 Italian  government leaders.
 This busy diplomacy reflects
 increased Israeli anxiety over
 the effect of events in Iraq,
 Lebanon, and Jordan on Israel's
 isolated position amid hostile
 Arab neighbors.
 The Israelis apparently
 feel recent events have hastened
 an Arab-Israeli showdown.   A
 settlement with UAR President
 Nasir seems as remote as ever,
 and the Israelis very likely as-
 sume that radical Arab nation-
 alism, as symbolized and led
 by him, by its very nature must
 eventually attempt an all-out
 assault on Israel.   The prospect
 that such an assault would be
 better coordinated than in 1948,
 in addition to being waged with
 modern Soviet weapons, emphasizes
 the seriousness of Israel's
 problem.   The travels of Mrs.
 Meir and Ben-Gurion have aimed
 at meeting this longer range
 contingency.   They have sought
 essentially .:late-model `arms-
 ments and a guarantee of Israel's
 territorial integrity.
 Results of Israeli Diplomacy
 In Paris, Mrs. Meir hoped
 to reconfirm close   French-
 Israeli ties with the De Gaulle
 government and effect a possible
 alliance.   Premier de Gaulle,

 size the relationship
 between the two coun-

 facilitate his policy
 of seeking  :a  rap.

 possibility of a for-
 mal French-Israeli
 alliance therefore
 probably is remote,
 but Israel may be
 able to obtain addi-

 France.
 Despite   De
 Gaulle's reticence
 on political      rela-
 tions, a close rela-
 tionship  between the
 armed forces of the two coun-
 tries very likely still exists.
 On 4 August, the subdirector
 for Levant affairs in the French
 Foreign Ministry, while telling
 an American  official  that
 French-Israeli relations had
 become "more reserved and objec-
 tive," conceded that strictly
 military relations remained ex-
 tremely close but that even
 working-level officials at the
 Foreign Ministry did not know
 exactly what form of agreement
 existed between the services of
 the two countries.
 In London, Mrs. Meir ap-
 parently received some encourage-
 ment.   Foreign Secretary Lloyd
 assured her  his government no
 longer intends to suggest any
 Israeli territorial sacrifices
 as it previously had proposed
 in seeking to promote an Arab-
 Israeli settlement.   Earlier,

 The Israelis probably see in
 Great Britain a  power  which
 might well consider  close co-

 to the protection of  British
 interests in  the  Middle East.
 The on-and-off status of Israel's

 part an effort to obtain British

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 11 September 1958
 passage of Israeli trade through
 the Suez Canal, and the Arab
 states as a whole cooperate in
 an economic boycott of Israel.
 This has prevented the Israelis
 from integrating their economy
 with that of the Middle East
 as a whole and has kept their
 ports from.,becoming commercial
 centers for the area.   Israel
 accordingly has been forced to
 seek commercial partners abroad.
 A particular endeavor has been
 made to establish trade rela-
 tions with African and Asian
 states, an effort to which the
 development of Eilat port on
 the Gulf of Aqaba and the main-
 tenance of  ::transit  rights
 through. the gulf are linked
 Israel sees another possi-
 ble means of increasing its
 earnings by becoming a passage-
 way for Middle Eastern oil
 bound for Europe.  After Nasir
 blockaded the Suez Canal in
 1956, the Israelis attempted to
 obtain Western support for con-
 struction of a 32-inch pipeline
 across Israel.   During the re-
 cent crisis, the Israelis again
 seized on the apparent threat
 to establish oil routes as an
 argument for Western sponsorship
 of  such  a   pipeline.   They
 achieved partial success in
 late August, when two interna-
 tional banking firms reportedly
 agreed to lend $15,000,000 to-
 ward completion of a 16-inch
 line linking Eilat and Haifa.
 Iranian oil, which Israel al-
 ready-obtains for domestic con-
 sumption, probably will be
 available for the new pipeline.
 Israel hopes European utiliza-
 tion of a trans-Israeli oil
 route would increase Western
 interest in its territorial in-
 tegrity.
 Israel,  with a population
 of slightly over 2,000,000, ex-
 fists amid an Arab Middle East of
 over 55,000,000 inhabitants.
 Nevertheless, the Israeli armed
 forces probably still could de-
 feat the combined Arab forces
 in a localized conflict, al-
 though their advantage in.train-
 ing and leadership is being in-
 creasingly countered by the
 quality and quantity of the So-
 viet-bloc arms and training the
 UAR has received.   The Israelis
 are fearful that as the Arab
 forces achieve proficiency in
 handling their new weapons,
 Israel's advantage will soon be
 overtaken.
 Moreover, the expansion of
 Nasir's influence this summer
 contributes to Israel's convic-
 tion that it must also obtain
 new weapons and equipment.   One
 of Foreign Minister Meir's prin-
 cipal tasks during her European
 visit in August was to lay the
 groundwork for such procure-
 ment.   In London,  she announced
 Israel's opposition to a Mid-
 dle Eastern arms embargo on
 grounds that it would benefit
 only the Arabs, who already have
 late-model weapons.
 An intensified Arab-Israeli
 arms race accordingly has begun.
 Shimon Peres, director general
 of the Israeli Ministry of De-
 fense, has presented Western
 countries with a detailed list
 of Israel's armament needs.
 A settlement of Arab dif-
 ferences in accordance-' with
 the UN General Assembly resolu-
 tion of 21 July would only re-
 move deterrents to coordinating
 Arab hostility against Israel.
 Heretofore, intra-Arab differ-
 ences have mitigated the effec-
 tiveness of the collective Arab
 threat to Israel;  Arab disunity
 was a considerable factor in
 Israel's success in the Arab-
 Israeli war of 1948 and per-
 mitted the Israelis to engage

 Nuri Said regime in Iraq,.-how-
 ever, eliminated Nasir's prin-

 therennhave been important modi-

 the  legacy  of  the Stalinist
 period and present party goals
 for economic development will
 tend to preserve this depend-
 ence,   at  least  through  the
 present Five-Year Plan (1956-

 While the West's share in
 Polish foreign trade has in-

 the    Poles  are  clearly  making
 strong  efforts  to  diversify
 their  foreign  markets  and
 sources of supply--both for the
 direct economic benefits and
 for the bargaining power such
 diversification provides in
 negotiation with the bloc--the
 Polish Government still considers
 most of its trade with the bloc
 vital to the achievement of its
 economic objectives.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 11 September 1958
 Soviet Economic Pressures
 The closeness of Poland's
 economic ties with the bloc
 puts the Soviet Union in a
 strong position to influence
 Polish actions in other spheres.
 Soviet economic pressures are
 likely to be most effective when
 employed in moderation in bar-
 gaining on limited issues.
 Political concessions could
 be exacted, for example, by of-
 fering economic aid or better
 terms of trade, or by withhold-
 ing credits or temporarily slow-
 ing the flow of selected raw
 materials.   There are indica-
 tions that the Soviet Union re-
 sorts to this tactic at times
 now.   However, basic concessions
 probably could not be exacted
 from the Polish Government by
 economic dictation, that is, by
 repeated small pressures which
 at some point would make the
 present economic relationship
 unfavorable to Poland, or by a
 partial or complete embargo on
 bloc trade with Poland.
 It appears that, if nec-
 essary, Poland could adjust its
 production structure sufficient-
 ly to make practicable a shift
 of trade to the West.   Such an
 adjustment was made by  Yugo-
 slavia after 1948 and by Poland
 after World War I when the new-
 ly formed nation had not only
 to create a pattern of foreign
 trade but also to develop do-
 mestic trade almost from scratch.
 After World War II, Poland
 shifted most of its trade from
 the West to the bloc.
 Economic sanctions leveled
 against Poland by the bloc would
 not greatly reduce supplies of
 essential consumer goods in the
 short run, since Poland  is
 practically self-sufficient
 agriculturally and a large share
 of its imports for light in-
 dustry comes from outside the
 bloc.
 Poland nevertheless would
 certainly suffer heavy economic
 losses from a bloc embargo.
 The metallurgical and machinery
 industries would be affected
 immediately and most severely
 for lack of supplies of ferrous
 raw materials and machine parts.
 Investments would in turn  be
 greatly reduced, and there would
 be severe unemployment in cer-
 tain  industries.   Yet                                                               given
 the necessary  foreign exchange,
 Poland  could  obtain  from
 the West an adequate quantity
 of nearly all goods now imported
 from the bloc,   and  without
 delay if the present buyers'
 market for most raw materials
 persists.
 The greatest difficulty
 would lie not in obtaining im-
 ports, but in shifting exports
 from bloc to Western  markets
 within a reasonably  short time
 and on a  large  scale.   For
 the  country's largest export
 commodity,   coal,   the shift
 could  be made  only at  sub-
 stantially                                                                       lower prices and
 in reduced quantities;   for
 machinery, the second    most
 important export  at present,
 the shift could probably  not
 be made for many  years, if at
 all.  Without large-scale West-
 ern aid,                                                           the      necessary ad-
 justments                                                                in production       and
 trade would  be extremely slow
 and painful.   In the long run,
 Poland could  profitably ex-
 pand                                                                its  exports to the West
 of processed      foods, textiles,
 fine  ceramics,  various handi-
 craft                                                                  products, and certain
 types of steel, machinery, and
 chemicals.
 The Soviet Union can exer-
 cise considerable influence on
 Polish policies through economic
 negotiations, but is unlikely
 to make extensive use of eco-
 nomic sanctions.   Such sanctions
 would probably accomplish noth-
 ing that could not be done by
 political means or by the threat
 of military action.   They would
 tend to bring about conditions
 inimical to Soviet interests--
 a shift in Poland's economic
 orientation to the West, and
 possibly enhanced popular sup-
 port for the Gomulka regime.

 manganese and high-grade iron
 ore, but this effort has been
 undercut by the decline during
 the past year in world demand
 for these products.
 Coffee and the Economy
 Coffee, although account-
 ing for only 5 percent of Bra-
 zil's GNP, has largely financed
 its vast postwar industrial ex-
 pansion by providing E60 to 70
 percent of the country's for-
 eign exchange and an even great-
 er percentage of its dollars.
 This dependence on a single
 commodity has made Brazil es-
 pecially vulnerable to the vi-
 cissitudes of the world mar-
 ket,  in which prices have fluc-
 tuated from 88 to 45 cents per
 pound over the past five years.
 Under the terms
 of this agreement,
 Brazil is to withhold
 40 percent of its
 marketable crop, com-
 pared with 15 percent
 for Colombia and 5-
 10 percent for other
 producers.   For the
 first six months of
 1958, Brazil's coffee
 exports were down al-
 most 10 percent over
 the same period last
 year.   In addition,
 the price of Brazil-
 ian coffee had dropped
 from 55 to 45 cents
 per pound by early
 September.
 Foreign Exchange Commitments
 Despite the serious drop
 in coffee prices and sales,
 Brazil's trade balance was fa-
 vorable in the early months of
 1958, and the drain on foreign
 exchange appeared primarily the
 result of payments on foreign
 loans and investment.   Such pay-
 ments amounted to $170,000,000
 in 1957 and are scheduled at
 $305,000,000 for 1958--or more
 than 20 percent of the country's
 total 1957 exchange earnings.
 This schedule of repayments con-
 tinues to balloon through 1959
 and 1960 and will be extremely
 heavy even should Brazil succeed
 in making arrangements to post-
 pone payments on the US private
 consortium loan of $200,000,000
 that falls due in those years.

 in early May of this year,
 Brazil's dollar holdings had
 virtually reached the zero mark
 and continued imports were pos-
 sible only through emergency
 loans from private American
 banks.   Subsequent loans from
 the IMF and the Export-Import
 Bank have brought total emer-
 gency assistance for
 the year to more than
 $250,000,000, but
 even this may be in-
 sufficient to meet
 Brazil's needs.
 Hope of New Investment
 The extent to
 which new foreign in-
 vestment can be ex-:
 pected to remedy the
 foreign exchange im-      809083B
 balance is question-
 able.   Although the Kubitschek
 regime has actively solicited
 foreign investment in all fields
 except oil, the vast inflow of
 the past decades--which brought
 US investment to $1.2 billion--
 has begun to taper off and,  in
 the past five years, profit
 remittances have exceeded new
 investment by between $100,000,-
 000 and $150,000,000 annually.
 The most ambitious new invest-
 ments are being made by Japan
 and Germany.   Some large new
 US operations may be undertaken
 in iron, should the world mar-
 ket improve, but such operations
 would for the short run bring
 mainly equipment from the US
 and not dollar funds.
 In the longer run, however,
 such investment--especially in
 the now-taboo field of oil--is
 considered one of the key solu-
 tions to Brazil's dollar prob-
 lem.   Oil imports cost Brazil
 between $250,000,000 and $270,-
 000,000 annually, mostly in
 dollars, and comprise about 20
 percent of the value of total.
 imports.   Brazil was reported
 "shaken to its roots" by the
 news in July that Argentina had
 reached agreements with private
 oil companies willing to invest
 almost $1 billion there--on a
 Brazil's national oil mo-
 noply, Petrobras, has been wide-
 ly praised over government radio
 stations in recent weeks for
 its success in having doubled
 production for  the  second
 straight year.  It is now produc-
 ing about 20 percent of nation-
 al demand, but this is the re-
 sult of transportation improve-
 ments?and not of new discoveries.
 The administration's recent
 strong praise for the government
 oil monopoly is probably dictated
 in part by the approach of the
 3 October congressional and
 gubernatorial elections.   Within
 Kubitschek's shaky congression-
 al coalition, the leftist Labor
 party and the  allied'  Social
 Progressive party are expected
 to gain at the expense of his
 own Social Democratic party.
 Some gains may also be made by
 the leading opposition party,
 the National.   Democratic ! Un-

 A number of the emergency
 measures taken to head off a
 foreign exchange crisis  are
 necessarily unpopular.  That

 is particularly  subject  to

 risking -any - compromise with pri-
 vate investment in'this field.-

 NIGERIA'S PRE-INDEPENDENCE PROBLEMS
 African regional leaders
 in Nigeria  will meet with Brit-
 ish representatives at a con-
 ference scheduled to begin in
 London on 29 September to estab-
 lish the date for Nigeria's in-
 dependence within the Common-
 wealth and to consider the re-
 ports of commissions which have
 been studying financial and po-
 litical problems.   They have
 unilaterally set April 1960 as
 the date, even though the coun-
 try still lacks national unity.
 Nigeria,  the largest unit
 in the British colonial empire,
 has a population of over 35,-
 000,000.   Under a 1957 consti-
 tutional arrangement with Brit-
 ain,                    there are a central govern-
 ment having carefully defined
 powers and four regional gov-
 ernments with local self-govern-
 ment except for such matters
 as defense,  police,  transporta-
 tion,            and currency.   The central
 government embraces the office
 of the federal prime minister,
 who is assisted by a cabinet
 which is representative of the
 leading party of each region,
 and a federal House of Repre-
 sentatives.   During the past
 year, Nigeria and Britain have
 reached agreement on Nigeria's
 responsibility for its armed
 forces,  a central bank and cur-
 rency, and arrangements to train
 Nigerians for the diplomatic
 service..
 Federal Prime Minister Abu
 Bakr Tafawa Balewa believes the
 country is in a dangerous mood
 because of the widespread na-
 tionalist feeling.   He feels
 London must recognize the 1960
 date for Nigeria's independence
 even though the political lead-
 ers have not been able to rise
 above regional religious and
 tribal differences.   Similarly,
 the British governor general be-
 lieves Britain must either grant
 independence by mid-1960 or move
 in troops.
 The forthcoming conference
 is a follow-up to a meeting in
 May-June 1957 at which Nigeria's
 future status was discussed.
 Commissions were set up to study
 problems such as allocation of
 revenue between the central gov-
 ernment and the regions,  control
 of the police, and recognition
 of the rights of tribal minori-
 ties by the creation of new po-
 litical subdivisions.   At that
 time British officials also prom-
 ised to give sympathetic consid-
 eration to early independence
 for Nigeria.   Subsequently, how-
 ever,  the Nigerian leaders uni-
 laterally set 2 April 1960 as
 the date for independence.
 The leaders now are report-
 ed dissatisfied with the Minori-
 ties Commission's proposal that
 no new regions be created,  some
 federal control be extended over
 the  minority' -tribal  areas;

 Representatives.                               Each leader
 wants to carve up the regional
 bailiwick of opposing politi-
 cians in order to weaken their
 influence and destroy their op-
 portunity to achieve the com-
 manding national position.   In
 view of Nigeria's heterogeneous
 tribal situation, any national
 leader must form a coalition
 with his counterpart in another
 region.   There are constant ru-
 mors of political deals but no
 firm alignments thus far.
 A united Nigeria has no
 historic precedent.   In 1914,
 Britain joined its separate pro-
 tectorates of Northern and South-
 ern Nigeria into one administra-
 tion;                    since then London has tried
 to develop Nigerian unity while
 gradually increasing self-govern-
 ment.   This approach has spurred
 regional demands for greater
 autonomy,  to which London has

 Regional Breakdown
 At present there are four
 regions--each with its own prime
 minister and legislature.   The
 Northern Region contains over
 half of the country's population
 but a smaller proportion' of the
 wealth.   Culturally distinct,
 the Northern Region is overwhelm-
 ingly Moslem and politically
 backward.   It is controlled by
 emirs who rely heavily on Brit-
 ish guidance.   During the 19th
 century,  the emirs and their
 armies were a threat to the more
 advanced Christians and pagans
 of the south. In recent years,
 however, the Moslems have feared
 that Nigerian independence would

 lead to an influx of southern
 administrators,  clerks,     and
 technicians.   Northern politi-
 cians therefore have resisted
 the drive toward early independ-
 ence.   Their leader,  the Sardauna
 of Sokoto, however, recently
 joined the other Nigerian lead-
 ers in their demand for inde-
 pendence.
 Southern Nigeria,  divided
 into the Eastern and Western
 Regions on the basis of distinct
 tribal groups,  now is the scene
 of the bitterest political skir-
 mishing.   Each region has an am-
 bitious, foreign-educated prime
 minister who aspires to dominate
 a united Nigeria--Obafemi Awolowo
 in the west,  Nnamdi Azikiwe in
 the east. The governing parties
 are formed from the dominat trib-
 al   groups,  while the opposi-
 tion's strength is drawn from
 the minorities.
 The political situation in
 the Eastern Region--described
 by the federal prime minister
 as virtually "a shambles"--has
 become increasingly unstable.
 In June 1958,  regional Prime
 Minister Azikiwe's control was
 seriously challenged by 31 im-
 portant members of his party,
 and the federal prime minister
 and the Western Region's prime
 minister are apparently increas-
 ing their intervention in the
 affairs of the Eastern Region.
 If regional opposition to Azikiwe's
 questionable methods grows,  he
 will probably not become an ef-
 fective influence on the nation-
 al scene.
 The Southern Cameroons is
 the fourth and smallest region.
 Its politicians,  however,  are
 preoccupied with the question
 of reunification with the French
 trust territory of Cameroun and
 do not play a significant role
 in Nigeria's political develop-
 ments.
 Political. disunity in Ni-
 geria is:h.virig an adverse effect
 on the nation's economy,  par-
 ticularly on economic develop-
 ment.   Disagreement over econom-
 ic policies and a shortage of
 competent personnel have already
 forced an extension of the orig-
 inal 1955-60 development program
 to 1962.   These factors have also
 restricted the country's rate
 of economic growth.   Nigeria's
 gross-national product has grown
 annually by about 5 percent since
 1951, but half of this may rep-
 resent an inflationary rise in
 prices.
 The relatively limited for-
 eign investment in Nigeria is
 largely British,  and Britain ac-
 counts for about 55 percent of
 Nigeria's annual trade of $770,-
 000,000.   This pattern of heavy
 reliance on the sterling area
 is not likely to be seriously
 changed following independence.
 Falling world commodity
 prices are having an increasing-
 ly adverse effect on the economic
 structure.   Restrictions on tin
 production have caused the lay-
 off of about 18,000 miners in
 the Northern Region, while fall-
 ing rubber prices have destroyed
 much of the incentive for the
 peasant rubber producers in the
 Western Region.   A 45-percent
 decline this year in the cocoa
 crop--the region's economic main-
 stay--also damaged the economy,
 although prospects for the forth-
 coming crop season appear bright-
 er.
 The Eastern Region may suf-
 fer from a reappraisal of its
 oil potential now being hinted
 at by some Shell - British Pe-
 troleum  officials.   Considerable
 development has taken place along
 the coast, but the high cost of
 transporting oil to ships and
 less favorable indications of
 oil are dampening earlier opti-
 mism.
 Despite an estimated $600,-
 000,000 in sterling reserves in
 London, Nigeria may also experi-
 ence balance-of-payments diffi-
 culties soon.   This is primarily
