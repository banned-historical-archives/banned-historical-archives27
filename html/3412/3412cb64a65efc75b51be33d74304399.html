CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
12 April 1956 
THE WEEK IN BRIEF 
PART I 
OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST 
ARAB-ISRAELI SITUATION   Page 1 
The pattern of Israeli reaction to last week's 
Egyptian commando raids in the Gaza area, and the fact 
that Egypt failed to give a direct answer to Israel's 
demand for a cease-fire, leave open the possililitv of an 
Israeli retaliatory raid of substantial size. 
SOVIET TACTICS 
IN THE ARAB-ISRAELI SITUATION   Page 3 
The USSR appears to regard the present situation in 
the Middle East as offering an ?unprecedented opportunity 
to widen the split between the Egypt-baudi-Syrian bloc 
and the West. In the UN Security Council deliberations 
last week, Soviet maneuvers were designed to cause the 
Arabs to question the motives behind the American reso-
lution and to reduce the scope of the secretary general's 
mission to the Middle East. 
BAGHDAD PACT MEETING   Page 4 
When the council of ministers of the Baghdad pact 
convenes in Tehran on 16 April, the four Middle East 
members can be expected to demand some tangible evidence 
of the usefulness of the pact. Disappointed over their 
failure to obtain any direct advantages from the alliance, 
the Middle East members probably will consider making 
the pact an instrument of economic planning and develop-
ment. Attempts will probably be renewed to obtain formal 
American adherence, and the United States may also be 
pressed to take a leading role in  the economic develop-
ment of the northern tier area. 
CEYLON ELECTION 
0 0 ? 0 ? 
?S C ............ 
S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, who became Ceylon's prime 
minister as a result of the victory of his united front 
coalition in this week's national elections, will find 
most other Ceylonese political parties supporting his 
announced socialist-neutralist policies. His government 
will find it difficult to deal with differences of 
opinion in parliament on the issue of one or  two national 
languages for Ceylon.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
12 April 1956 
SOVIET EXPECTATIONS 
FOR VISIT TO BRITAIN   Page 6 
During their visit to Britain, starting on 18 April, 
Khrushchev and Bulganin will probably engage in conver-
sations on trade and disarmament, perhaps propose a 
friendship treaty with Britain, as well as restate the 
Soviet desire to take part in a conference on the Middle 
East. A 9 April Pravda statement expressing the dis-
appointment of the Soviet leaders that the British were 
limiting the opportunities for contacts with British 
people suggests that a major goal of the trip is to make 
a favorable impression on the population as Malenkov did 
during his recent trip. 
PART II 
NOTES AND COMMENTS 
MAO'S STANDING IN CHINA 
UNIMPAIRED BY ATTACK ON STALIN   . . . Page 1 
Although the Chinese Communists have joined in the 
attack on the cult of personality, they are not disposed 
to detract from the stature of Mao Tse-tung. The USSR 
does not appear willing to make an issue of the special 
treatment given Mao, although it would probably prefer 
to see less adulatory references to the Chinese leader. 
SATELLITES EXONERATE 
HIGH-LEVEL PURGE VICTIMS  ? 1  Page 2 
The Soviet Communist Party's public disavowal of the 
last two decades of Stalin's one-man rule has opened the 
way to complete the program, begun in 1953, of reversing 
or modifying the charges brought against top-level 
Satellite Communists purged during the Stalin era. The 
degree of exoneration, however, will apparently vary. It 
will probably be complete only in those Satellites 
neighboring Yugoslavia where the charges were primarily 
nationalism and conspiracy with Tito, and the major 
victims, like Rajk, were executed.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
12 April 1956 
BULGARIAN PREMIER'S POSITION 
IMPERILED   . . ? ? ? Page, 
The Bulgarian central committee's criticism of 
Premier Vulko Chervenkov augurs severe limitation on 
his powers, if not removal from his position as number-
one Bulgarian political leader. The secretariat of 
the party has already been enlarged, and the central 
committee is reported to have voted to "rehabilitate" 
Chervenkov's former rival Traicho Kostov, executed as 
a "Titoist" in 1949. An extraordinary session of the 
Bulgarian National Assembly has been set for  16 Anvil  
probably to consider changes in government.] 
NEW "LIBERALISM" IN POLAND   Page 5 
Poland has officially gone further than any other 
Satellite in its interpretation of the downgrading of 
Stalin. Polish public information media regard the 
Soviet 20th Party Congress as "a denial of slavish 
adherence to formula" and as promoting a new liberalism 
in numerous fields. The abundance and intensity of the 
Polish comment probably reflect Polish nationalist re-
sentment of Stalin and the Warsaw government's eagerness 
to place the blame elsewhere for measures which have 
proven unpopular. In propagating the new liberalism 
the Warsaw regime must exercise caution to keep  Polish 
nationalist sentiment in bounds. I  
MIXOYAN IN COMMUNIST ASIA 
? a S ? ? . ........ 
Soviet first deputy premier Anastas I. Mikoyan 
completed his trip through Asia with stops in Peiping 
and Ulan Bator. The trip was highlighted by the signing 
of an aid agreement with China which committed the USSR 
to further support of Chinese Communist economic 
25X1 development. 
LAOS   Page 7 
In the expected absence of any solution to the Pathet 
Lao problem resulting from this month's meeting of the 
Geneva co-chairmen, the Laotian government may decide to 
see what a direct meeting with the Viet Minh could pro-
duce.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
12 April 1956 
JAPANESE-SOVIET RELATIONS Page 
The USSR, in response to a Japanese request, has 
agreed to talks on the fisheries problem either in Tokyo 
or Moscow. Japanese foreign minister Shig3mitsu prefers 
Moscow and has selected a delegation of government 
officials and private fisheries representatives. Mean-
while, Japan's chief delegate at the London peace treaty 
talks publicly hinted that Japan's weak position may 
force it to make some unpopular concessions to obtain an 
over-all settlement with the USSR. 
SCANDINAVIAN-SOVIET AIR AGREEMENTS   Page 8 
The bilateral civil air agreements between the 
Soviet Union and Sweden, Norway and Denmark signed on 
31 March are the USSR's latest move in tbe establishment 
of direct scheduled air flights between Moscow and the 
West. The USSR, by virtue of its geographic position, 
offers the shortest air route from Europe to the Orient, 
which it can use as a bargaining point for further air 
agreements with Western countries. 
LYSENKO'S REPLACEMENT 
Lysenko's replacement by Lobanov as head of the 
USSR's Agricultural Aeademy amounts to repudiation of 
Lysenko's theories in the field of biology and will 
probably accelerate a return by Soviet scientists to 
established beliefs hnd techniques in biology and 
agriculture. 
Page 10 
SOVIET IMPORTS OF ALUMINUM ORE   Page 11 
Current Soviet efforts to obtain gubstantial amounts 
of bauxite from Greece and Yugoslavia suggest that in 
the future the USSR may become partially dependent on 
alumillum ore from outside the Sino-Soviet bloc. Unless 
new iiiternal sources of bauXtte are developed soon, 
Soviet bloc supplies by 1960 will be inadequate to 
support the USSR's planned aluminum production.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
12 April 1956 
. ? ? 
? ............. 
Military operations have been stepped up in Algeria7 
In Morocco, a joint 
Moroccan-Spanish statement accepted, in principle, 
independence for the Spanish zone, but left unsolved 
several pressing issues. ' In Tunisia, Neo-Destour 
president Habib Bourghiba is assuming formal governmental 
responsibilities. 
TURKEY'S ECONOMIC SITUATION 
? ? ...... 
Turkey's.worsening eronomic situation is characterized 
by serious inflation and lack of essential goods and raw 
materials. The government is apparently divided on 
whether to devalue the currency, and a new cabinet crisis 
may develop over the issue. 
EFFECT OF STALIN REPUDIATION 
ON THE ITALIAN LEFT ,  
The Soviet leaders' repudiation of Stalin appears 
to have had more impact on the Italian left than on 
other left-wing groups outside the Sino-Soviet bloc. 
The turmoil within the Communist and Nonni Socialist 
Parties has threatened unity within both parties and may 
be weakening their alliance. Communal and provincial 
elections, to be held throughout Italy on 27-28 May, are 
likely to find Togliatti and Nenni competing with each 
other for leadership of the Italian left. 
WEST GERMANS FEAR DISARMAMENT 
MAY OVERRIDE UNIFICATION ISSUE . . .. . ..... ? ? ? 
West German officials and the press are displaying 
sensitivity to statements suggesting that agreement can 
be reached on disarmament or any other important East-
West issue on the basis of a continuing division of 
Germany. The 3onn government has protested recent 
remarks by French premier  Mollet And Soviet Communist 
Party chief Khrushchev..

PART III 
PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES 
BRITISH POLICY TOWARD THE USSR ON THE EVE OF THE BULGANIN-
KNRUSHCHEVVISIT ..... ? ? . ....... . .... 
The British government, which has for some months 
shown increasing concern over the new tactics of Soviet 
foreign policy, is treating the 18-27 April visit of 
Bulganin and Khrushchev primarily as an opportunity to 
probe Russian intentions, particularly with reference to 
the Middle East. Britain would be interested in any 
Soviet overtures that would appear to lessen the 
prospects of war between Israel and the Arab states. 
INDIAN ATTACKS AGAINST PAKISTAN SYMPTOMATIC OF NEHRU'S 
HOSTILITY TO SEATO AND BAGHDAD PACT   
Indian prime minister Nehru's antagonism to 
Western-sponsored defense alliances in Asia appears to 
be expressing itself in a tougher policy toward Pakistan--
a member of both SEATO and the Baghdad pact. Increased 
Indian pressure on Pakistan--especially over the ex-
plosive Kashmir issue--may intensify Pakistan's efforts 
to force the West to choose between it and India.

Page 3 
JAPAN COMPETES FOR ROLE IN ASIAN DEVELOPMENT   Page 5 
The Japanese government has well-defined plans for 
the economic development of South and Southeast Asia--
a region where Communist economic penetration is be-
ginning to have an impact,but where 'Iritain and West 
Germany still offer Japan its stiffest competition. 
Tokyo's plans are to open new sources of supply for 
cheap raw materials and to stimulate the Asian market 
for Japanese goods. But these plans are likely to fall 
short of their potential unless the government is willing 
to devote greater financial resources to developing such 
trade than it has in the past.

PEIPING ATTEMPTS TO OVERCOME PETROLEUM DEFICIENCY . . Page 9 
Communist China's First Five-Year Plan (1953-1957) 
places great emphasis on the development of petroleum 
resources. Production of crude oil increased from 
120,000 tons in 1949 to 980,000 tons in 1955. This is 
equal to one day's United States production and five 
days' Soviet production. Sharply rising consumption 
forced China to import 57 percent of its requirements 
last year. This dependence on imports has been a 
major military vulnerability and has tied up some 
overland transport from the USSR. 
BRAZIL'S FOREIGN POLICY UNDER KUBITSCHEK   Page 12 
President Kubitschek's first 60 days as head of 
the Brazilian government have revealed his intentions 
to expand commercial relations with Western Europe and 
the Soviet bloc. There are indications that he will 
seek at the same time to strengthen Brazil's tradi-
tional ties with the United States.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
12 April 1956 
against Egyptian forces, there 
would be very strong pressure 
on Egyptian prime minister Nasr 
to reply in kind, but the pres-
ence and activity of UN secre-
tary general-Hammarskjold may. 
exercise a restraining influence 
on both parties and may even be 
used as an excuse for postponing 
new actions. 
By sending in terrorists, 
Nasr apparently hoped to have 
again, without incurring a full-
scale reprisal from the Is-
raelis, the success this kind 
of operation enjoyed last fall. 
Although last fall's successes 
have not been -f--t-s 
he Egyptian press, 
y quo ng e Tel Aviv radio, 
has again been able to claim 
that the Arabs have struck 
terror into Israeli hearts. 
Israeli Reaction  
The pattern of Israeli 
reaction would appear to call 
for a retaliatory raid of sub-
stantial size. However, the 
Israelis seem to realize the 
advantage they now have--with 
the highest UN official on the 
scene--as the most recently 
injured party. Hammarskjold 
was disappointed with the 
Egyptian response to Israel's 
request for a cease-fire,,and 
asked for a less equivocal 
statemedt from -Cairo. 
Coupled with this factor 
is the ability of the Israeli 
security forces to limit the 
scope of the terrorist incur-
sions. The success of the 
Israeli government's security 
measures is believed to have 
led to some relaxation in the 
tension among the population 
and possibly to have stolen 
some thunder from Israeli ex-
tremist groups which probably 
are calling for forceful re-
taliation. 
Air Battle 
Frequent overflights by 
both sides resulted in an air 
battle on 12 April in which 
an Egyptian Vampire jet fighter 
was shot down over Israeli ter-
ritory. Egypt had previously

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
12 April 1956 
SOVIET TACTICS 
IN THE ARAB-ISRAELI SITUATION 
The USSR appears to regard 
the present situation in the 
Middle East as offering it an 
unprecedented opportunity to 
widen the split between the 
Egyptian-led Arab bloc and the 
West. Fully aware of Egypt's 
growing isolation from the 
Western powers--especially 
France and Britain--and its 
determination to alter the 
present Middle Eastern balance 
of power in favor of the Arabs, 
Moscow has shown its intention 
to give the Egyptian-led Arab 
bloc political, economic, and 
limited military support until 
the entire situation is reopened 
in the UN Security Council or 
a special conference is con-
vened at which the Soviet Union 
can press its campaign for a 
permanent voice in the Middle 
East. 
Moscow probably believes 
that by capitalizing on deep-
seated Arab antagonisms toward 
Israel and taking an active 
anti-West, pro-Arab position in 
the tangled diplomatic maneuvers 
that will be forthcoming on 
Middle Eastern problems, it can 
pry the Egyptian-led Arab bloc 
still further away from its re-
maining ties with the West and 
bring it permanently into align-
ment with the Asian neutralists. 
PART I 
In the Security Council's 
deliberations last week, Soviet 
maneuvers were designed to sup-
port Arab questioning of the 
motives behind the US resolu-
tion and to limit the scope of 
the secretary general's mission 
to the Middle East. Although 
the USSR's pro-Arab amendments 
were rejected, they emphasized 
to the Arabs that the USSR was 
taking seriously  its role as  
their champion.  
Although the Soviet posi-
tion has been openly pro-Arab 
for some time, it has not been 
violently anti-Israeli. In-
stead, Moscow's primary criti-
cisms have been directed 
against the Western Big Three 
powers. 
Moscow has maintained the 
West intends to send troops

is for this reason that Moscow

BAGHDAD PACT MEETING 
The secona meeting oi the 
Baghdad pact council of min-
isters opens in Tehran on 16 
April. The prime ministers of 
the four Middle Eastern member 
countries will be present: 
Adnan Menderes for Turkey, Nuri 
Said for Iraq, Hussain Ala for 
Iran and Chaudhri Mohammad 
All for Pakistan. Britain will 
be represented by Minister of  
War Sir Walter Monckton. 
The major items to be dis-
cussed will be the reports of 
the various committees--mili-
tary, economic, counter-sub-
versive and liaison--which have 
been meeting almost steadily 
since the first meeting of the 
council of ministers in November 
1955. Discussion is expectdd 
to be particularly extensive on 
economic problems, as the mem-
bers appear to be giving greater 
consideration to making the 
pact an instrument of economic 
planning and development. 
Britain has already announced 
PART I 
action that might serve its 
objective of bringing the Arabs, 
closer to the USSR. 
If open conflict between 
the Arabs and the Israelis does 
not force the Security Council 
to reopen the problem before Ham-
marskjold returns, Moscow probably 
will wait for his report before 
pressing the problem further. 
that it is allotting $700,000 
for economic projects. 
The Middle East members 
are discouraged at the lack 
of progress and feel that the 
pact may not survive if vig-
orous action is not taken at 
this meeting. Secretary-General 
Awni Khalidi has said that the 
pact had to reach down to the 
common man for support "even 
if for no more than a Baghdad 
pact malaria team," adding 
that the pact's days would be 
numbered if it continued to 
be supported only by the govern-
ment leaders. 
Although the pact members 
are pleased that the United 
States will be represented by 
a high-level delegation of 
observers, further attempts 
will probably be made to se-
cure formal American adherence. 
The members will also press 
the United States to take a 
leading role in financing the 
economic development of the 
northern tier area.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
12 April 1956 
CEYLON ELECTION 
. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, who 
became Ceylon's new prime min-
ister after the smashing upset 
scored by his united front 
coalition in the three-day 
elections held on 5, 7, and 10 
April, should find most other 
Ceylonese political parties 
supporting his announced so-
cialist-neutralist policies. 
It is possible, however, that 
before his government can imple-
ment these policies it will be 
seriously embarrassed by dif-
ferences of opinion in parlia-
ment on the issue of one or two 
national languages for Ceylon. 
Party Strengths  
Bandaranaike's united 
front won 51 of 95 contested 
seats in the lower house of 
parliament, His own Sri Lanka 
Freedom Party won 40 of these, 
the Trotskyite Viplavikara 
Lanka Sama Samaja 5, and as-
sociated independents 6. Out-
side the front, the Trotskyite 
Nava Lanka Sama Samaja won 14 
seats, Tamil parties 13, Sir 
John Kotelawala's United Na-
tional Party 8, Independents 6, 
and Communists 3. 
Prime Minister Kotelawala's 
resignation on 11 April paved 
the way for Bandaranaike to as-
sume the premiership almost im-
mediately. His united front 
holds an absolute majority of 
one seat in the 101-man lower 
house and will presumably be 
strengthened by 6 more votes 
when Bandaranaike appoints 6 . 
additional members representing 
special interests as he is en-
titled to do. Thus, if the 
front remains united, it will 
continue to hold a majority 
even after the house has been 
raised to its full new strength 
of 105, following special 
elections for four seats al-
located to registered Ceylonese 
citizens of Indian and Pakistani 
descent. 
In parliament, the 14 
Trotskyite Nava Lanka Sama 
Samaja members, the majority 
of the 13 members from Tamil 
parties, the three Communists, 
and some independents would 
probably support Bandaranaike's 
announced policies of national-
ization of foreign business 
holdings, Ceylonization of 
trade (a policy commenced by 
the ousted UNP), dissociation 
from power blocs, elimination 
of British bases and troops 
from Ceylon, and the establish-
ment of diplomatic relations 
with tile USSR and Communist 
China. 
It is possible, however, 
that before Bandaranaike has 
the opportunity to implement 
these policies he will be seri-
ously embarrassed,by differ-
ences of opinion on the national 
language question. 
The Language Issue  
Under pressure from the 
Sinhalese-speaking Buddhist 
population of Ceylon, which 
constitutes between 70 and 80 
percent of the total population 
and which was primarily respon-
sible for Bandaranaike's eleva-
tion to power, Bandaranaike as 
one of his first items of busi-
ness will probably have to seek 
a constitutional amendment 
making Sinhalese the sole na-
tional language. A two-thirds 
majority is required to effect 
such an amendment. 
Since Zandaranaike's own 
Sri. Lanka Freedom party controls

saril have considerable outside

support to carry an amendment. 
The 13 Tamil members of parlia-
ment will be automatically op-
posed to any policy which does 
not recognize both Tamil and 
Sinhalese as national languages. 
The Trotskyite Nava Lanka Sama 
Samaja and Communist parties, 
represented by 17 members, 
campaigned on a two-language 
platform. Some independents 
probably also favor two lan-
guages. 
The 8 members of the de-
feated United National Party, 
who would probably seize any 
opportunity to cause Bandara-
naike's downfall, might well 
oppose him on thig, point despite 
their party's one-language 
stand. Finally, the loyalty 
of the other members of Bandara-
naike's united front is some-
what uncertain. Bandaranaike 
may therefore be faced with a 
bloc of at least 38 opposing 
votes, making it impossible 
for him to win the required 68. 
Bandaranaike's only real 
opportunity to obtain a two-
thirds majority would seem to 
lie in his altering the two-
language stand of the 14 Nava 
SOVIET EXPECTATIONS 
FOR VISIT TO BRITAIN 
During their visit to 
Britain, starting on 18 April, 
Khrushchev and Bulganin will 
prubably want to hold conversa-
tions on trade and disarmament 
and will perhaps propose a 
friendship treaty with Britain, 
as well as restate the Soviet 
desire to take part in a con-
ference on the Middle East. 
A Pravda statement of 9 April 
expressing the disappointment 
of the Soviet leaders that the 
British were limiting their 
Lanka Sama Samaja members. His 
best chance to do so would be 
to offer the party at least 
two posts in his cabinet. It 
is doubtful whether Bandara-
naike would be willing to pay 
this price or whether the Nava 
Lanka Sama Samaja party would 
agree to participate in his 
government. 
Other Issues 
Considering his weakness 
on the language issue, Bandara-
naike may move slowly until he 
has thoroughly tested senti-
ment in parliament, and he may 
not press immediately for meas-
ures nationalizing foreign 
holdings and ousting British 
forces from Ceylon. He may 
soon declare Ceylon a republic. 
However, he may for some time 
retain its Commonwealth status 
in view of widespread Ceylonese 
fears that India would attempt 
to fill the gap left by the 
British. He may also be slowed 
somewhat by recognition that 
Trotskyite, Communist and dis-
sident Tamil members constitute 
one third of the total parlia-
ment strength. 
opportunities for contacts with 
British people suggests that a 
major goal of the trip is to 
make a favorable impression on 
the population as Malenkov did 
during his recent trip. 
Soviet resentment over the 
British arrangements, which 
will keep to a minimum the 
number of cities and institu-
tions the Soviet leaders will 
visit, had led Bulganin to sug-
gest on 3 April that the trip

12 April 1956 
be postponed. The next day, 
however, he agreed to Prime 
Minister Eden's request that 
he come as scheduled. 
Topics for Discussion  
The British have scheduled 
much of Bulganin's and Khru-
shchev's time for substantive 
discussions. Moscow, while 
expressing a desire for such 
talks, has given few clues as 
to the subjects it favors for 
discussion. 
Disarmament will probably 
be the major topic stressed by 
the Soviet leaders. They will 
presumably seek to prove that 
the USSR's position has been 
brought close to the British 
stand, emphasizing particularly 
the similarity of the Soviet 
plan for a zone in central 
Europe subject to armaments 
limitation and inspection and 
the Eden plan presented at the 
summit conference. The Soviet 
plan assumes the continued 
division of Germany, and has 
been rejected by Britain as well 
as the United States on this 
ground. The Soviet leaders 
may use the occasion to make 
some additions to the 27 March 
Soviet disarmament proposal. 
Bulganin and Khrushchev 
are likely to take a cautious 
attitude toward most of the 
issues that come up, being 
careful not to antagonize the 
British on such matters as 
colonialism and probably not 
making obvious efforts to 
weaken the Great Britain-United 
States alliance. Their interest 
In discussing various issues 
may be limited because of a 
belief that such divisive tac-
tics would not be particular-
ly profitable at this time. 
With respect to the Middle 
East, one of the subjects the 
British particularly want to 
discuss, the Soviet leaders will 
probably do little more than 
reaffirm their eagerness to take 
part in a conference on the area 
and their belief that the Bagh-
dad pact is the real cause of 
tension there. 
Possibly in preparation 
for discussions of the problem 
of Vietnam elections, a meeting 
was scheduled on 11 April be-
tween A. A. Gromyko and Lord 
Reading, representing the co-
chairmen of the 1954 Geneva 
conference. The USSR has re-
portedly agreed to postpone the 
July 1956 date for all-Vietnam 
elections while pushing for a 
new Geneva conference on Indo-
china. 
Bilateral Issues 
There are few outstanding 
bilateral issues between Brit-
ain and the USSR. Premier Bul 
ganin, in an interview on 11 
April, said that the USSR was 
Interested in expanding trade 
with Britain considerably, and 
in particular stressed the advan-
tages that would result if 
Britain was willing to abandon 
strategic trade controls. Bul-
ganin is likely to propose a 
friendship treaty such as that 
which he suggested to President 
Eisenhower. His second letter 
to the President on 1 February 
stated that the USSR was williqg 
to conclude similar treaties 
with Britain and France. 
The two sides should have 
no trouble in agreeing to in-
creased cultural exchanges, al-
though the USSR will probably 
resist, as it did at Geneva, any 
agreement to remove obstacles to 
the free flow of information 
such as the jamming of broad-
casts. (Also see PART III,.

NOTES AND COMMENTS 
MAO'S STANDING IN CHINA UNIM-
PAIRED BY ATTACK ON STALIN 
Although the Chinese Com-
munists have joined in the at-
tack on the cult of personality, 
they are not disposed to detract 
from the stature of of Mao Tse-
tung. The USSR does not appear 
willing to make an issue of the 
special treatment,given Mao, al-
though it. would probably prefer 
to see less,adulatory references 
to the Chinese ieader. 
A Chinese Communist edi-
torial of 4 April, reprinted 
in part in Pravda on 7 April, 
flni=. first non-Soviet comment 
on Stalin to be published in the 
USSii, although astern European 
comments were available much 
earlier. This may reflect Soviet 
sensitivity to the Chinese at-
titude on the re-evaluation of 
the former Soviet leader. The 
Soviet leaders are probably 
aware of Western speculation on 
a Sino-Soviet difference on the 
question of Stalin and "collec-
tive leadership" and used this 
means to indicate unanimity. 
While Peiping's explanation 
of the reasons for and the na-
ture of Stalin's errors has 
generally followed Soviet prop-
aganda treatment, the Chinese 
editorial implied that a com-
parable situation did not exist 
in China. The re-evaluation of 
Stalin was presented as primarily 
a Soviet problem without direct 
effect either on Mao Tse-tung's 
position or on fundamental 
Chinese Communist Party policies. 
Importance of Individual Leaders  
The Chinese editorial, while 
criticizing Stalin for putting 
himself above the masses, af-
firmed the importance of indi-
vidual leaders. Peiping has 
justified its preferential 
PART II 
treatment of Mao in recent 
months on the ground that he 
above all other Chinese leaders 
"feels the pulse of the broad 
masses." 
Since the Soviet 20th Party 
Congress in February, Peiping 
has almost completely elimi-
nated references to Stalin and 
has divorced certain theories 
from his name and attributed 
them to Mao Tse-tung as the 
"outstanding leader in our 
party's theoretical work." 
This will almost certainly in-
crease the great prestige which 
Mao already enjeys in China and 
among Asian Communists. 
While devaluating Stalin, 
the Chinese Communist editorial, 
in some respects, treats Stalin 
more gently than the Russians 
have themselves. For example, 
the Chinese have emphasized 
more than the Russians the idea 
that Stalin and his teachings 
should not be condemned in tato. 
The Chinese editorial explic-
itly calls for "serious" study 
of the works of Stalin, es-
pecially those "correctly sum-
marizing Soviet experience in 
construction." 
Whereas Soviet speakers 
at the 20th Party Congress 
spoke of the achievements of 
the "Chinese Communist Party," 
the Chinese Communists continue 
to credit these achievements to 
the "directives of Mao Tse-
tung" and speak of the Chinese 
party's central committee, 
"headed by Mao Tse-tung." At 
the reception given in Peiping 
on 7 April for visiting Soviet 
leader Mikoyan, Vice Chairman 
Chu Teh referred to "Mao Tse-
tung and other leading per-
sonages of China." In his

SATELLITES EXONERATE HIGH-LEVEL 
PURGE VICTIMS 
The Soviet Communist Party's 
public disavowal of the last 
two decades of Stalin's one-man 
rule has opened the way to com-
plete the program, begun in 1953, 
of reversing or modifying the 
charges brought against top-
level Satellite Communists 
purged during the Stalin era. 
The degree of exoneration, how-
ever, will apparently vary. It 
will probably be complete only 
in those Satellites neighboring 
Yugoslavia, where the charges 
were primarily nationalism and 
conspiracy with Tito, and the 
major victims, like Rajk, were 
executed. 
The Hungarian goverdment 
announced on 29 March the com-
plete exoneration of former 
foreign minister Laszlo Rajk 
and, according to unconfirmed 
reports, the Bulgarian central 
committee has exonerated former 
politburo member Traicho Kostov. 
Both men were tried and executed 
for nationalist deviation in 
1949. In Poland, however, where 
the major victim, former party 
secretary general Wladyslaw 
Gomulka, is still alive, and in 
Czechoslovakia, where Titoism 
was a secondary charge against 
former secretary general Slansky, 
the regimes have already indi-
cated that the victims will not 
be politically rehabilitated. 
Effects in Satellites  
This Moscow-inspired pro-
gram will have a number of ef-
fects. Within the bloc, it 
adds a semblance of credibility 
to Communist claims that justice

the Chinesepeople." 
an legality are being sincerely 
pursued in the post-Stalin era. 
Iti also intended to encourage 
initiative among party members 
and to Win greater popular sup-
port for the regimes. Exter-
nalry, it supports Soviet ob-
jectives of making Communism 
more appealing to the non-
Communist world, and is es-
pecially useful in encouraging 
Tito to increase his ties with 
the Soviet bloc. 
While the original charges 
in the Satellite purges were 
contrived to meet Soviet propa-
ganda needs at the time, in most 
cases the purges appear to have 
been at least in part the out-
growth of serious factionalism 
or struggle for power within the 
parties. This was almost cer-
tainly true of the major purges in 
Albania,'Bulgalria, Czechoslovakia, 
and East Germany, and probably 
was an important factor in the 
Hungarian, Polish and Rumanian 
purges. 
The trend of eVents in the 
last few months has already 
Stimulated renewed factionalism 
within the parties. The regimes' 
repudiation of their past actions 
against former "nationalist" 
leaders is likely to give further 
encouragement to nationalist 
elements within the parties and 
complicate the present leaders' 
problems in setting limits on the 
criticism now being permitted.' 
The rehabilitations will 
increase unrest, particularly 
in the East German, Polish, and 
Hungarian parties where

rank-and-file members are already 
confused over the recent at-
tacks on Stalin. 
In Hungary, where there 
was already strong nationalist 
opposition to party first secre-
tary Rakosi's leadership, rumors 
are widespread that the "reha-
bilitation" of Rajk has caused 
prominent Communists to join in 
the increasing criticism of 
BULGARIAN PREMIER'S POSITION 
IMPERILED 
The Bulgarian Communist 
Party central committee's 
criticism of Premier Chervenkov 
augurs severe limitation on his 
powers, if not removal from his 
position as number-one Bulgarian 
political leader. The party 
secretariat has already been 
enlarged, and unconfirmed 
reports claim the central com-
mittee has voted to "rehabil-
itate" Traicho Kostov, a rival 
of Chervenkov's who was executed 
as a "Titoist" in 1949. 
CHERVENKOV 
Rakosi. Rakosi apparently still 
retains Moscow's support, how-
ever. In their message of greet-
ings to the Hungarian leader-
ship on the eleventh anniversary 
of the Hungarian liberation on 
4 April, Khrushchev and Bulganin 
praised Rakosi as a "tested 
veteran of the revolutionary 
movement responsible for a num-
ber of important measures."' 
Any derogation of Cherven-
kov will please Tito. The Yugo-
slays have long considered 
Chervenkov one of the most 
Stalinist of the Eastern Euro-
pean leaders. It has often 
been rumored that one of Bel-
grade's prices for further 
reconciliation with the Soviet 
bloc has been the political 
"heads" of such men as Cher-
venkov, and that Moscow is 
willing to pay this price. 
Official Criticism  
The Bulgarian party central 
committee resolution adopted 
during a plenum held from 2 
to 6 April and announced on 
8 April said that "the cult 
surrounding the person of 
comrade Vulko Chervenkov changed 
to a great extent the traditional 
and tested methods of work of the 
Bulgarian Communist Party, 
namely, internal party democracy 
and collective leadership." It 
said thatttis had at times led 
to unilateral decisions and 
hurt the "organizational, ideo-
logical, and economic work of 
the party and state."

parties in discussing the Soviet

that the cult of personality 
had extended into their coun-
tries, the Bulgarians are the 
only ones to associate these 
admissions directly with their 
present top leader. 
Present Leadershi 
After Stalin's death in 
1953, the individual Satellite 
leaders who in most cases head-
ed both the government and the 
party divested themselves of 
one post or the other in con-
formity with Moscow's line of 
instituting collective leader-
ship. Most of them resigned 
as premier and retained party 
leadership, but Chervenkov pre-
ferred to exercise his authority 
formally as premier rather than 
as party first secretary, boss-
ing the party from behind the 
scenes 
At the Bulgarian party 
congress in February 1954, 
Chervenkov formally relinquished 
the post of party secretary gen-
eral and Todor Zhivkov, a rela-
tive nonentity, took over in 
the position. Chervenkov ap-
peared to keep the party reins 
in his own hands, and he led 
the Bulgarian delegation to 
the Soviet 20th Party Congress 
in Moscow. However, Zhivkov, 
who did not even go to the con-
gress, was the one to report on 
it at the recent Bulgarian cen-
tral committee meeting. Although 
considered a Chervenkov man at 
the time of his appointment, 
Zhivkov may be used now as a 
relatively "neutral" element to 
modify Chervenkov's predomi-
nance in the regime. 
One of the two new appoint-
ees to the secretariat, Encho 
Staikov, a politburo member, 
reportedly holds dual Soviet-
Bulgarian citizenship and has 
had a background in police and 
political indoctrination work. 
He may have been appointed to 
assure Moscow a check on future 
activity in the party, even 
though Chervenkov himself has 
always been known as a good, 
loyal "Muscovite." The other 
new member, Boyan Bulgaranov, 
apparently represents the other 
major Bulgarian party group, 
the "nativiSts," who spent the 
war years in Bulgarian partisan 
activity rather than in Moscow. 
The choice of these two men, 
therefore, appears in part to 
be an attempt to please each 
of the two basic groups within 
the party. 
Problems of Succession 
Chervenkov may, of course, 
be completely demoted. An ex-
traordinary session of the Bul-
garian National Assembly, set 
for 16 April, will probably 
approve some changes in the 
government structure and may be 
used to effect Chervenkov's 
ouster. 
In this event, the exist-
ence of factions in the Bulgar-
ian party might complicate the 
problems of finding a successor 
for Chervenkov. The present 
number-two man, Deputy Premier 
Anton Yugov, is a "nativist." 
Moscow and the Moscow-oriented 
elements of the Bulgarian party 
may feel that making him pre-
mier would encourage "nativist" 
elements to set an overly inde-
pendent course for Bulgaria. 
To keep this group within bounds 
an attempt may be made to set 
up a "collegial" system spread-
ing power among several inplud-
ing Yugov and possibly "re-
formed" Chervenkov. I

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
12 April 1956 
NEW "LIBERALISM" IN POLAND 
Poland has officially gone 
further than any other Satellite 
in its interpretation of the 
downgrading of Stalin. Polish 
public information media regard 
the Soviet 20th Party Congress 
as "a denial of slavish ad-
herence to formula" and as 
promoting a new liberalism in 
numerous fields. The abundance 
and intensity of the Polish 
comment probably reflect Polish 
nationalist resentment of Stalin 
and the regime's eagerness to 
place the blame elsewhere for 
measures which have proven un-
popular. 
The Poles, in their en-
thusiasm to cast off the re-
strictions of Stalinism, have 
called for: "youth...thinking 
independently," public debate, 
especially in parliament, and 
greater freedom and independence 
in the arts. Premier Cryankie-
wicz, calling for a new period 
of "bold and creative ferment" 
at a national conference of 
architects, stated that "the 
past two decades have been 
fatally weighted down by the 
painful distortions which grew 
...from the omnipotence of 
Stalin, who usurped the position 
of final authority in all fieldq 
not only. architecture, but also 
science, literature and art." 
Laws and Enforcement 
Another call for more 
creative activity and independ-
ent thought was made in sev-
eral recent broadcasts which 
criticized the unanimity of 
voting in the Polish parliament 
(Sejm) and demanded public 
discussions and clashes of view 
in order to reach correct con-
clussions. Jerzy Rawicz, writ-
ing on 31 March in Trybuna Ludu, 
the official organ of the P-61-Tgh 
United Workers (Communist) Party, 
attacked the formula that since 
"there are no fundamental 
antagonisms in the Sejm, all 
the deputies should not discuss, 
but vote unanimously." 
In an article on the trade 
unions, Trybuna Ludu deplored 
the fact that "the labor laws 
in our country are systematical-
ly violated." 
The new liberalism also 
has called for a return to the 
rule of law to replace "the 
lack of supervision over organs 
of government." 
Another example of the 
criticism of the regime was an 
open letter, published in Zycie 
Warszawy on 28 March, whitE----
stated that many people who had 
been sentenced to long prison 
terms for high treason were 
being released without the 
public being informed of their 
"rehabilitation in the eyes of 
justice." The letter called on 
the minister of justice to 
remedy the situation so that 
these men would be rehabilitated 
in the eyes of society as well. 
This letter set the stage 
for the regime's announcement 
on 6 April that former party 
secretary general Gomulka, 
purged in 1949 for "nationalist 
deviations," has been cleared 
of "unfounded accusations," 
though no change has been made 
in "the correct thesis of 
political and ideological 
struggle which the party... 
continues to conduct against 
the false ideological con-
ceptions represented by Gomulka." 
In addition, other purged of-
ficials, including Generals 
Komar and Spychalski, have been 
exonerated. 
Problems for the Leaders 
The Polish regime is faced 
with the task of curbing the 
Poles, who have always been

MIKOYAN IN COMMUNIST ASIA 
Soviet first deputy pre-
mier Anastas I. Mikoyan com-
pleted his trip through Asia 
with brief stops in Peiping and 
Ulan Bator, arriving back in 
Moscow on 10 April where he 
will probably take over while 
Bulganin and Khrushchev are in 
London. Mikoyan, as number-
three man in the Soviet hier-
archy, once before "tended the 
farm"--as Bulganin put it--
while Bulganin and Khrushchev 
were at the Geneva conference 
last year. 
The last phase of the 
trip was highlighted by the 
signing of agreements with 
China which committed the USSR 
to further support of Chinese 
Communist economic development. 
These agreements had been 
initially negotiated in Moscow 
and were probably completed 
before he arrived. They sup-
plement those signed in 1953 
and 1954. 
One calls for the con-
struction and equipping of 55 
new industrial enterprises in 
China in addition to the 156 
enterprises for which the 
USSR is already committed. 
Among these new enterprises 
are metallurgical plants, 
machine-building plants, 
synthetic fiber and plastics 
factories, enterprises for 
"electrical technique and 
radio technique industries,"

is said to have been gaining

only serve to bolster opposi-
tion to the present leadership. 
fantortes producing synthetic 
liquid fuel, power stations, 
and "scientific research insti-
tutions for the aeronautical 
industry." 
The other agreement pro-
vides for the opening in 1960 
of a new railroad linking 
China and the USSR--the 2,000-
mile Lanchow-Aktogai railroad 
through northwest China. 
The total value of new 
Soviet assistance is equivalent 
to 2.5 billion rubles. No loan 
appears,to have been granted to 
finance this sum, which is to 
be defrayed "through trade pro-
cedures." The new commitments, 
while not increasing the annual 
level of Soviet support to 
China, will extend support well 
into China's Second Five-Year 
Plan (1958-1962). 
The Soviet-Mongolian 
communique signed by Mikoyan 
on 8 April provides for "long-
term credits on easy terms" to 
Outer Mongolia. Soviet aid is 
to include assistance in 
residential construction and 
the construction of public 
Utility and other enterprises. 
Agreement was also reached on 
the transfer of two narrow-
gauge ,railroads to the Soviet-
MongoliOn Joint Stock Company 
of the Ulan Bator railroad and 
on joint geological surveys.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
12 April 1956 
LAOS 
In the expected absence 
of any solution to the Pathet 
Lao problem resulting from this 
month's meeting of the Geneva 
co-chairmen?Britain and the 
USSR--the Laotian government 
may decide to see what a direct 
meeting with the Viet Minh can 
produce. 
The Indian charge in 
Vientiane has been trying to 
arrange for Premier Souvanna 
Phouma to make a courtesy visit 
to Hanoi. He feels the Viet 
Minh might 'persuade" the 
Pathets to accept the govern-
ment's authority in the two 
northern provinces in return 
for a pledge not to enter any 
military alliances or to admit 
any foreign military personnel 
into Laos. Viet Minh terms 
would presumably include the 
elimination of American influ-
ence. 
Souvanna Phouma has de-
clared he will treat with 
"great circumspection" any 
Communist approach, but he is 
apparently pleased by the 
triendly treatment of his 
JAPANESE-SOVIET RELATIONS 
The USSR, in response to 
a Japanese request, has agreed 
to talks on the fisheries prob-
lem either in Tokyo or Moscow. 
Foreign Minister Shigemitsu 
expects the negotiations to 
begin shortly in Moscow and 
has selected a delegation of 
government officials and pri-
vate fisheries representatives. 
Interim Agreement Possible 
The USSR will probably 
limit the talks to the question 
of its restrictions on salmon 
fishing which become effective 
govetnftent in Chinese Communist 
and Viet Minh propaganda. More-
over, he has agreed in principle 
to a Pathet Lao proposal to re-
open political negotiations, 
thus backing away from the 
government's previous position 
that negotiations must be pre-
ceded by Pathet Lao acceptance 
of the control spmmission's 7 
January resolution, which 
called for prompt restoration 
of the government's autllority 
in Phong Saly and Sam Neua 
Provinces. 
Meanwhile, intensified 
military action may occur at 
an isolated government post in 
Sam Neua Province. The pres-
ence of a truce team at the 
post since last June has served 
to protect it, but Polish mem-
bers of the team have withdrawn 
after being threatened by 
government troops. If they do 
not return, the Indian and 
Canadian members will have no 
basis under the Geneva agree-
ment for staying. The govern-
ment has alerted commando units 
to reinferce the post, a symbol 
of its determination to maintain 
a foothold in the north.

Moscow has consistently made a 
general fisheries settlement 
conditional on the conclusion 
of a peace treaty. The USSR 
will probably be prepared to 
present an interim regulation 
agreement on salmon fishing in 
terms, that will be extremely 
adverse to Japan.

relations. Any temporary ar-
rangement would reduce somewhat 
the pressure on the Tokyo gov-
ernment from Japanese fishing 
interests for an early peace 
treaty, but the unilateral na-
ture of the Soviet restrictions 
is likely to remain a source of 
dissatisfaction for the Japanese. 
In view of Moscow's resist-
ance on the repatriation issue, 
which the Hatoyama government 
has proposed also be discussed 
apart from the peace talks, 
there may be some disposition 
in Tokyo to soften Japanese 
territorial demands to obtain 
a settlement on fishing and 
repatriation. 
Japan May Be Conciliatory 
Meanwhile, Japanese chief 
negotiator Matsumoto, whore-
turned to Tokyo following the 
SCANDINAVIAN-SOVIET 
AIR AGREEMENTS 
The bilateral civil air 
agreements between the Soviet 
Union and Sweden, Norway and 
Denmark signed on 31 March are 
the USSR's latest move in the 
establishment of direct sched-
uled air flights between Moscow 
and the West. A concurrent 
agreement was reached between 
the Scandinavian Airlines System 
(SAS) and Aeroflot, the Soviet 
civil air organization, pre-
sumably implementing the bi-
lateral agreements0 
suspension of the London talks, 
has publicly hinted that it 
may be desirable to take a 
"practical view" of the situa-
tion. He has referred to 
Japan's weak power position, 
the improbability of American 
support or of further Soviet 
concessions on the territorial 
issue, and the Soviet refusal 
to settle the fishing and 
repatriation problems without 
a peace treaty. 
The Japanese negotiator 
stated, "We may have to do some 
things even more unpopular than 
Jutaro Komatsu once did," a 
reference to concessions by the 
Japanese negotiator at the peace 
conference after the Russo-
Japanese War of 1904-1905. 
Matsumoto says he is willing to 
wait for a "very powerful leader-
ship" to "reshape public opinion 
and carefully align the public 
attitude toward the negotia-
tions." 
Details concerning rates 
and flight schedules will be 
worked out in a forthcoming con-
ference between SAS and Aeroflot 
representatives. An SAS spokes-
man said his company may provide 
daily connections with Moscow 
beginning in May, although the 
American embassy in Stockholm 
reported that the agreement 
called for SAS to operate two 
flights weekly in each direc-
tion. Apparently, the agree-
ment provides for flight service

which will result in a rough 
balance of seating capacity 
between Aeroflot and SAS. 
Both lines will use two-
engine conventional-powered 
aircraft. Riga, the only stop 
en route to and from Moscow, is 
to be a "technical" stop for 
purposes of maintenance and re-
fueling only. SAS representa-
tives will be located in Riga 
and Moscow and an SAS commer-
cial office- in Moscow is 
planned. 
The volume of traffic is 
uncertain despite the SAS con-
tention that the traffic with 
Russia is"increasing rapidly 
both ways:' The Finnish airline, 
currently the only non-Orbit 
line operating into Moscow, has 
found that the traffic between 
Helsinki and Moscow will sup-
port no more than token flights. 
Besides Finland, three 
other non-Orbit countries--
Yugoslavia, Austria and Afghan-
istan--have negotiated civil 
air agreements with Moscow. 
However, these countries either 
do not have aircraft capable 
of making regular passenger 
flights into Moscow or have 
made no moves to implement the 
agreements. 
Advantages for USSR 
The agreement with SAS has 
given the USSR access to civil' 
air routes outside the Orbit 
which will enable Soviet pilots 
to gain valuable experience. In 
return it has given to SAS--an 
airline with major world air 
routes--rights for overflights 
of Soviet territory. As it 
gains experience and adds new 
equipment, the USSR will be in 
a position to capture more pas-
senger traffic and to expand 
its services to more routes. 
Moreover, the USSR controls the 
shortest air route from Europe 
to the Orient, which it can use 
as a bargaining poiut for fur-
ther agreements with Western 
countries. 
The route from London 
to Tokyo via Moscow, for ex-
ample, is over 1,000 miles 
shorter than the polar route 
via Greenland and the North 
American continent and some 
3,000 miles shorter than the 
India-Pakistan route.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
12 April 1956 
LYSENKO'S REPLACEMENT 
The release of T. D. 
Lysenko from his post as presi-
dent of the All-Union Academy 
of Agricultural Sciences "at 
his own request" would appear 
to administer the coup de grace 
to Lysenko's biological and 
agricultural theories, the best 
known of which claimed that 
changes in environmental con-
ditions could alter hereditary 
characteristics of plants. The 
latter hypothesis, which re-
ceived Stalin's wholehearted 
approval because it appeared to 
confirm Marxist doctrine, has 
long been denounced by Western 
geneticists and has been of-
ficially discounted in the 
Soviet Union since Stalin's 
death. 
Lysenko himself has been 
the target of frequent Soviet 
criticism over the past three 
years but appeared to be sur-
viving the downgrading of his 
theories. He still retains his 
post as director of the Insti-
tute of Genetics, as well as 
membership in the Academy of 
Sciences and the Academy of 
Agricultural Sciences, but it 
is clear that his over-all 
influence in the agricultural 
field has been broken. 
Lysenko's doctrines have 
had a profound influence on 
Soviet biological and agri-
cultural research for more 
than a decade, and even though 
these doctrines may now be 
abandoned, considerable harm 
has been done to the generation 
of scientists trained according 
to his precepts. The appli-
cation of his theories un-
doubtedly hindered the develop-
ment of improved varieties of 
agriculturally important plants. 
Soviet geneticist N. P. Dubinin 
recently blamed Lysenko for 
blocking earlier Soviet attempts 
to carry out a hybrid corn 
breeding program and now the 
USSR has officially requested 
permission to send a delegation 
of scientists to study American 
corn breeding techniques. Ly-
senko's removal will probably 
accelerate a return by Soviet 
scientists to beliefs and tech-
niques in the fields of biology 
and agriculture generally ac-
cepted in the West. 
Personnel Shifts 
Lysenko was succeeded in 
the agricultural academy post 
by P. P. Lovanov, former minis-
ter of agriculture in the Rus-
sian Republic (RSFSR), who was 
promoted to USSR deputy premier 
in the post-Malenkov reorgani-
zation in February 1955. He 
acted as Khrushchev's principal 
assistant in agricultural mat-
ters until after Matskevich was 
appointed Soviet minister of agri-
culture in October 1955. Since 
then Lovanov's political for-
tunes have waned; he was the 
only deputy premier not elected 
a full member of the party's 
central committee at the 20th 
Party Congress in February 1956. 
Lobanov is not a scientist 
by training and his career has 
been almost exclusively in the 
field of agricultural adminis-
tration. In a speech in April 
1955, Lobanov described the 
mission of agricultural scien-
tific institutes as improvement 
of practical work rather than 
abstract theorizing. He has 
been particularly active in the 
past three years in connection 
with the Soviet party and 
government efforts to increase 
agricultural production. His 
public statements and articles 
reflect a special knowledge of 
and concern for the problems of 
agricultural mechanization.

SOVIET IMPORTS OF ALUMINUM ORE 
Current Soviet efforts to 
obtain substantial amounts Of 
bauxite from Greece and Yugo-
slavia suggest that in the 
future the USSR may become par-
tially dependent on aluminum 
ore from outside the Sino-soviet 
bloc. Unless new internal 
sources of bauxite are developed 
soon, Soviet bloc supplies will 
be inadequate by AW?O to support the 
USSR b planned aluminum production. 
The Sixth Five-Year Plan 
calls for Soviet production of 
an estimated 1,100,000 metric 
tons of aluminum a year by 1960 
--about double 1955 :production. 
This will require at least 
4,500,000 tons of bauxite an-
nually. 
The USSR will produce an 
estimated 1,200,000 tons of 
bauxite in 1960, and will prob-
ably be able to import about 
1,600,000 tons from Hungary and 
another 200l0o0 tons from Ru-
mania, leavihea deficit of 
about 1,500,000 tons a year. 
The USSR is now using only about 
2,000,000 tons a year, but it 
is attempting to cope with 
the anticipated deficit in three 
ways. It is engaged in inten-
sive exploration for new de-
posits of bauxite; in a large-
opinion of the US agricultural 
attache in Moscow, Matskevich 
will probably be a stronger and 
more dynamic agricultural over-
lord than Lobanov.

and in efforts to increase im-

The USSR had obtained only 
negligible quantities from 
Greece until last year. In the 
second h lf of 1955, however, 
it took delivery on 100,000 tons, 
and asked permission of the 
Greek government to purchase 
an additional 300,000 tons dur-
ing a 17-month period beginning 
in August 1955. It has indicated 
a willingness to purchase from 
400,000 to 800,000 tons a year 
for the next three years. 
Under the terms of the

signed on 6 January, Moscow 
will import 100,000 tons Of

NORTH AFRICA 
Algeria 
Military operations in Al-
geria are increasing in scope 
and intensity as the build-up 
of French security forces con-
tinues. 
the rebels in recent en-
gagements have revealed better 
arms and discipline than in the 
previous hit-and-run fighting. 
In the western area, France 
has evacuated 5,000 persons 
from a "no- man's land," in an 
effort to control more effec-
tively rebel traffic across the 
Moroccan border. 
Meanwhile, France is trans-
ferring to Algeria up to 40,000 
men from units in Germany and 
French West Africa. These re-
inforcements, it is estimated, 
will boost French ground strength 
to approximately 230,000 men be-
fore the end of April. 
On 11 April the French cab-
inet endorsed Minister Lacoste's 
request for still more substan-
tial reinforcements by approving 
a decree permitting military 
authorities to recall up to 
200,000 men from the "ready 
reserve" as needed. Reportedly, 
the initial orders will go out 
immediately in order to get re-
inforcements of 70,000 to 80,000 
to Algeria by the end of May. 
Naval forces in North African

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
12 April 1956 
French Morocco 
Moroccan negotiations 
witL the French to define the 
terms of "interdependence 
between two countries are 
likely to be complicated by 
an increasing Moroccan involve-
ment in Algerian matters. The 
issue of aid to Algerian 
nationalists will probably 
arise in connection with the 
formation of a Moroccan army, 
which is the most immediate 
issue facing Moroccan and 
French negotiators. France has 
proposed an army of 20,000 
soldiers, formed largely by 
the transfer of Moroccan units 
now in the French army and 
staffed and trained by France. 
Spain wants to participate in 
staffing and training this 
army and the Moroccans insist 
that the few Moroccan officers 
occupy key posts. 
The increasing number of 
countries which have recognized 
Moroccan independence was 
swelled this week by the Chi-
nese People's Republic and 
Iraq. The sultan, who has not 
yet named a foreign minister, 
is expected to appoint Abder-
rahim Bouabid, prominent Isti-
qlal leader and now minister

ment, to head a foreign min-
istry. Because there are few 
Moroccans qualified to staff 
diplomatic posts, as well as 
for budgetary reasons, the 
number of such establishments 
will initially be small, pos-
sibly limited to Paris, Wash-
ington, London, Cairo, and 
Madrid. 
A three-day strike of sev-
eral thousand Moroccan and 
European workers at the four 
American air force bases al-
legedly had the full endorse-
ment of the Istiqlal party and 
the sultan, who believed it 
necessary to demonstrate to the 
United States tae urgency of 
Moroccan labor demands. The 
strike was ended on 11 April, 
however, without the fulfill-
ment of any of the 14 demands 
of the pronationalist Moroccan 
Union or Labor (UMT). 
Spanish Morocco 
The Madrid conversations 
resulting in the 7 April 
declaration proclaiming the 
independence of the Spanish 
protectorate of Morocco were 
reported to have been "stormy." 
Many troublesome issues were 
left unsettled, including the 
future of the Spanish enclaves 
of Ceuta and Melilla, whose 
return was requested by the 
Moroccans. The Spaniards tried 
unsuccessfully to obtain Moroc-
can agreement to a condition 
that the transfer to Morocco 
of full powers in the Spanish 
zone follow the achievement of 
"genuine independence" of the 
French zone. 
All indications point to 
further rough going when 
negotiations are resumed on 7 
May. Spain will make every 
effort to have a voice in 
Moroccan affairs and a position 
in a united Morocco equal to 
that of France.

government to succeed the care-
taker cabinet of Premier Tahar 
ben Ammar, which resigned on 
9 April. 
By emerging from the wings 
to the center of the stage of 
Tunisian politics, Bourghiba 
may hope both to recapture the 
elements of the Neo-Destour 
party which have looked to 
extremist Salah ben Youssef for 
leadership and to play a more 
dominant role in current nego-

TURKEY'S ECONOMIC SITUATION 
Turkey's worsening eco-
nomic situation is characterized 
by serious inflation and a des-
perate lack of essential goods 
and raw materials. The govern-
ment is apparently divided on 
whether to devalue the currency, 
and a new cabinet crisis may 
develop over the issue. 
The public debt has passed 
the billion-dollar markt and 
foreign trade has reverted to 
its usual deficit position fol-
lowing a small surplus in Jan-
uary. The cost of living, which 
rose 5 percent during the last 
quarter of 1955, continues to 
climb, reflected especially in 
food prices. Shortages of raw 
materials and spare parts have 
forced many industries to lower 
production. Metallurgical 
industries have been operating 
at 10-20 percent of capacity, 
and textiles and cement, at 
about 80 percent0 
independence, and is now likely 
to press harder for more favor-
able terms for Tunisia when 
negotiations with France are 
resumed in mid-April. 
Tunisian minister of in-
terior Mongi Slim has been con-
ferring in Paris with Minister 
of State Savary on the transfer 
of internal security powers to 
the Tunisians. The French cite 
the need for protecting French 
nationals in Tunisia as the 
main objection to transferring 
control over security matters 
to the Tunisians. The acting 
high commissioner in Tunis re-
cently informed the American 
consul general that terrorist 
activities in the south and 
west may soon reach such pro-
portions that French inhabitants 
will have to be evacuated. 
Prime Minister Menderes, 
Secretary General for Economic 
Affairs Esenbel, and Ambassador 
Gork are still pushing for a 
large US loa, which they re-
gard as a badly needed "shot 
in the arm" because of the 
country's critical cash position 
and inability to meet demands 
for consumer goods. These 
officials continue to oppose 
devaluation, although there 
is growing support within the 
government for taking some 
action on the exchange rate. 
American representatives in 
Ankara believe immediate 
action on devaluation and 
debt funding is essential.

continues to rebuff Soviet 
economic aid offers, but it is

EFFECT OF STALIN REPUDIATION 
ON THE ITALIAN LEFT 
The Soviet leaders' re-
pudiation of Stalin appears to 
have had more impact on the 
Italian left than on any other 
left-wing group outside the 
Sino-Soviet bloc. The turmoil 
within the Communist and Nenni 
Socialist parties has threat-
ened unity within both parties 
and may be weakening their 
alliance. The Italian local 
elections on 27 and 28 May are 
likely to find party leaders 
Togliatti and Nenni competing 
with each other for leadership 
of the left. 
Togliatti's Problems  
Togliatti, challenged by 
his colleagues for subservience 
to Moscow, appears to be on 
the defensive, and the American 
embassy in Rome reported on 23 
March that the Communist Party 
was undergoing a real crisis. 
Although Togliatti has since 
secured a somewhat equivocal 
retraction of criticism from 
his prominent party colleague, 
Senator Terrapini, and has 
apparently brought other 
critics badk into line, the 
embassy comments that Togli-
atti's attempts to control the 
party may well lead to new 
dissatisfaction.

vulnerable to Soviet blandish-
ments and propaganda. 
Possible Cabinet Crisis 
The reported resignation 
of Minister of Economy Ulas in 
protest against Menderes' 
Interference in the affairs of 
his ministry may presage another 
cabinet crisis over the economic 
situation. Unusual political 
activity throughout Turkey 
during the past month suggests 
the possibility of a new po-
litical alifnment. 
25X1 
Nenni's Tactics 
Togliatti's problems have 
been further complicated by the 
statements of Nenni, who is 
striving to reconcile the pro-
and anti-Stalin elements within 
his own parIty. In the 26 March 
issue of the Socialist Party 
organ Avanti!, Nenni commended 
Togliatti as the only Com-
munist leader defending those 
aspects of Stalin which made 
him a histbric and heroic 
figure. ,At the same time, how-
ever, Nenni emphasized that 
his own party, contrary to the 
CommuniSts, had consistently 
expressed reservations with 
regard to certain of Stalin's 
policies. 
In an earlier Avanti!  
article, shortly after Togli-
atti's return from the Soviet 
20th Party Congress, Nenni 
in effect invited the Com-
munists to debate the causes 
which had led to the "cult of 
personality" in the USSR. In 
the same article, Nenni said 
that "Communist errors" were 
responsible for the split in 
the Socialist movement during 
the early 1920's. 
Togliatti has apparently 
tried to side-step such a de-
bate, and did his best,according

WEST GERMANS FEAR DISARMAMENT 
MAY OVERRIDE UNIFICATION ISSUE 
West German officials and 
the press are displaying sen-
sitivity to statements suggest-
ing that agreement can be 
reached on disarmament or any 
other important East-West issue 
on the basis of a continuing 
division of Germany. 
Prior to the opening of 
the UN subcommittee meetings 
on disarmament in London on 
19 March, both the government 
and opposition in Bonn approved 
of disarmament as a possible 
road to German unification. 
The press, however, was already 
voicing concern that "German 
unification might be sacrificed 
on the altar of disarmament." 
In recognition of these fears, 
the Bonn government arranged to 
be kept fully informed if issues 
concerning Germany were discussed 
in London. 
Mollet's "US News" Interview 
On 3 April, the Bonn 
government was unpleasantly 
surprised by French premier 
to the Nenni Socialists, and 
Togliatti evidently considered 
it necessary to urge his fol-
lowers on 3 April not to shift 
to Nenni. 
Meanwhile, center and left-
of-center parties are concen-
trating their attention on 
Nenni. Republican deputy La 
Malfa has suggested to his 
party that a meeting ground 
between the center and the 
Nenni Socialist Party, "which 
cannot be regarded as a total-
itarian party" may now exist. 
The Social Democratic directo-
rate published a statement on 
31 March challenging Nenni to 
break with the Communists and 
subscribe to the principles of 
the Socialist International. 
Mollet's statements in US News 
and World Report criticizing 
Western policy and proposing 
that disarmament be put on the 
list of international business 
ahead of German unification. 
The next day Soviet leader 
Khrushchev publicly endorsed 
Mollet's remarks, and expressed 
the view that German unifi-
cation was not necessary to 
world peace. 
Bonn issued a statement 
protesting Mollet's remarks and 
declared that "no German govern-
ment will be prepared to discuss 
seriously proposals for the re-
laxation of tensions based on 
even the temporary division of 
Germany." The German ambassa-
dor in Paris pointed out to 
Mollet that such serious matters 
should be co-ordinated in ad-
vance among the Allies. Bonn 
described Khrushchev's views 
as "completely unrealistic." 
On this last point, the opposi-
tion Social Democrats, who had 
professed to see in Mollet's 
position a "way out of the blind 
alley," expressed complete 
agreement.

General Gruenther Misquoted  
Bonn's apprehensions a-

supreme Allied commander in 
Europe, was incorrectly quoted 
in the West German press as 
having said that NATO strategy 
was based on an initial with-

event of attack. Responsible 
West German papers asserted 
that if this report was correct, 
"Allied headquarters will have 
to think of a new plan." 
Although Mallet has since 
assured Bonn there is no change 
in French policy and he feels 
there can be no secure peace 
without German unification, 
Chancellor Adenauer apparently 
is anxious for a meeting with 
the French premier to seek 
further reassurance of Western 
solidarity on this issue.

PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES 
BRITISH POLICY TOWARD THE USSR 
ON THE EVE OF THE BULGANIN-KHRUSHCHEV VISIT 
The British government, 
which has for some months shown 
increasing concern over the new 
tactics of Soviet foreign 
policy, is treating the 18-27 
April visit of Bulganin and 
Khrushchev as primarily an op-
portunity to probe Russian in-
tentions, particularly with 
reference to the Middle East. 
The recently concluded tour 
of ex-premier Malenkov and the 
preparations for the Bulganin-
Khrushchev visit have focused 
the British public's attention 
to an unusual extent on rela-
tions with the USSR. Advance 
arrangements have been exten-
sively debated in the press and 
by the public; but except among 
fellow travelers and some Bevan-
ite elements, there so far ap-
pears to be no inclination to 
assume that Soviet policy has 
undergone more than a tactical 
change. The arrival of security 
chief Serov to make advance 
preparations for the visit was 
generally considered as confirm-
ing this. 
The efforts of certain 
Eastern European refugee groups 
to organize hostile demonstra-
tions have received no important 
support from either Labor or 
Conservative Party circles, how-
ever, and the US Information 
Service in London believes 
Malenkbv's performance as good-
will ambassador, which occa-
sioned favorable press comment 
at a ratio of more than two to 
one, greatly smoothed the way 
for Bulganin and Khrushchev. 
Re-examination of USSR Policy  
This surge of public in-
terest in relations with the 
USSR has been paralleled in 
government circles by an ex-
tensive re-examination of Soviet 
policy, starting with the Czech-
Egyptian arms deals last Sep-
tember and becoming more in-
tensive after the 20th Party 
Congress in February. 
The Foreign Office was 
particularly disturbed by the 
Soviet entry into areas of tra-
ditional British influence as 
signalized by the Middle Eastern 
arms deals and the Bulganin-
Khrushchev visit to India and 
Burma. It saw these moves as 
meaning that Moscow, though re-
pudiating full-scale war as an 
instrument of national policy, 
was still bent on Communist ex-
pansion through ways that might, 
lead to war. 
The Soviet policy of com-
petitive coexistence through 
the use of economic enticements 
to underdeveloped areas is seen 
by London as offering a special 
threat to its own position in 
these areas because of Brtain's 
present economic inability to 
compete in kind. As a result, 
Britain has been informally 
trying to interest the United 
States in expanding economic 
aid programs, particularly to 
the Baghdad pact countries. 
British officials have also 
been seeking ways in which Lon-
don can regain the initiative 
on the diplomatic front. 
Several aspects of the 
20th Party Congress caused 
British officials special con-
cern. One was the statement 
that there was more than one 
way of achieving socialism--
and indeed the emphasis on 
"socialism" rather than "com-
munism." This line, British 
officials fear, will be partic-
ularly seductive in colonial 
areas and in neutral or un-
committed countries. 
Another aspect was the 
de-emphasis of Stalin in favor

12 April 1956 
of Leninist collective leader-
ship. One official saw this 
line as likely to delude seg-
ments of the British public, 
and stated that the Foreign 
Office planned a campaign to 
expose the dangers of Leninism. 
Prime Minister Eden evi-
dently shares the Foreign Of-
fice worries. In mid-March 
he reportedly gave French pre-
mier Mollet his "personal esti-
mate" that the present Soviet 
diplomatic and economic tactics 
are even more dangerous than 
those in use when NATO was 
established. 
Attitude Toward the Visit  
Against this background, 
the British government evidently 
sees the Bulganin-Khrushchev 
visit, initiated at the summit 
conference last July, as both 
a diplomatic opportunity and a 
propaganda hazard. 
Every effort is being made 
to keep the visit as much as 
possible in a purely diplomatic 
context, avoiding the "triumphal 
tour" aspects which character-
ized Bulganin's and Khruschev's 
visit to India and Burma and 
Malenkov's trip to Britain. Of 
the eight full days in their 
scheduled stay, three provide 
for talks at 10 Downing Street 
and two others for dining with 
Eden--one of them including an 
overnight stay at the Chequers 
estate. A trip to only one im-
portant industrial center, 
Birmingham, will be made. At 
the same time, the Foreign Of-
fice has endeavored to dissuade 
the leaders of Eastern European 
refugee groups from causing any 
disturbances, and London twice 
soughisszto dissuade Moscow from 
sending Serov to superintend 
the security arrangements. 
Diplomatically, on the 
other hand, Britain has evi-
dently tried to capitalize to 
some extent on the fact that it 
is the first Western country to 
receive the top Soviet leaders. 
Possibly seeing some parallel 
with the 1954 Geneva conference 
where he won great prestige as 
a "bridge" between East and 
West, Prime Minister Eden dis-
cussed the impending visit with 
French premier Mollet during 
their 10-11 March conference. 
Foreign Secretary Lloyd will 
report on it afterward to Mol-
let and Foreign Minister Pineau 
before they undertake their 
own trip to Moscow. 
Conduct of the Talks 
In the talks themselves, 
Eden and other top leaders seem 
to see mainly an opportunity to 
probe the intentions and mutual 
relationships of the top Soviet 
leaders. This idea was an im-
portant part of Churchill's orig-
inal 1953 proposal for summit 
talks and has appeared again 
In the comments of some of the 
British leaders--mainly on the 
Labor side--who talked with 
Malenkov. There is also a 
general British hope of correct-
ing at least some of the Soviet 
leaders' dangerous misconcep-
tions about the West. 
The agenda for substantive 
discussions is extremely loose, 
and the British have emphasized 
that they have no intention of 
turning the "serious talks" in-
to negotiations on any question 
of multilateral interest. Topics 
of bilateral concern mentioned 
by the Foreign Office official 
arranging the details of the 
visit include such matters as 
radio jamming and cultural ex-
changes. 
British officials have 
made clear, however, that they 
hope for an exchange of views 
on several matters of key im-
portance, presumably including 
the Middle East situation. 
While Britain apparently 
has no proposals to offer, it 
would be interested in any

Soviet overtures that would ap-
pear to lessen the prospects of 
war between Israel and the Arab 
States. 
The British also anticipate 
a serious eXChanie of views on 
disarmament. As of late Feb-
ruary, the Foreign Office ex-
pected the Russians to offer a 
new friendship treaty--which 
Britain planned to reject on 
the grounds that there had been 
insufficient time since their 
1955 abrogation of the 1942 
pact, to see how coexistence 
worked. 
Nervousness About US Attitude  
Several recent remarks by 
British officials about the 
Bulganin-Khrushchev visit have 
indicated some anxiety lest 
Anglo-American co-operation be 
imperiled by too great an aura 
of "good will" toward the Soviet 
guests. The British ambassador 
in Moscow, for example, in tell-
ing his American colleagues of 
London's advice that Serov be 
kept at home, remarked that he 
hoped the Russians would send 
Serov anyway as a "grim reminder" 
of Soviet reality. 
Foreign Office officials 
have expressed to the American 
embassy in London a hope for 
some "clumsy" Khrushchev re-
mark that would serve to 
further cement Anglo-Ameri-
can solidarity. They have even 
suggested that Eden intends to 
receive the Russians as leaders 
of a hostile state--a plan 
scarcely compatible with the 
schedule prepared for them. 
INDIAN ATTACKS AGAINST PAKISTAN 
SYMPTOMATIC OF NEHRU'S HOSTILITY TO SEATO AND BAGHDAD PACT 
Indian prime minister 
Nehru's antagonism to Western-
sponsored defense alliances in 
Asia appears to be expressing 
itself in a tougher policy to-
ward Pakistan, a member of both 
SEATO and the Baghdad pact. 
Increased Indian pressure on 
Pakistan--especially over the 
explosive Kashmir issue--may 
result in intensified efforts 
by Pakistan to force the West 
to choose between it and India. 
The Tough Policy  
Nehru has from the begin-
ning campaigned vigorously 
against Western defense align-
ments in Asia. Although he 
made it clear in 1954 that he 
felt American military assist-
ance to Pakistan had "introduced 
a new element' into Indian-
Pakistani negotiations on Kash-
mir, he did not until recently 
translate his anger into action. 
In the first three months 
of 1956, India apparently in-
itiated a series of incidents 
along its borders with Pakistan. 
The incidents were timed to 
coincide with the SEATO council 
meeting in Karachi between 6 
and 8 March and were followed 
by Indian charges that Ameri-
can weapons were being used by 
the Pakistani forces involved. 
On 29 March, Nehru made a 
blistering 90-minute speech 
in the Indian parliament attack-
ing SEATO and the Baghdad pact 
and denouncing Pakistan's claims 
to Kashmir.

that there are also political 
disadvantages. Thus, Nehru can

against the pacts without as-

Meanwhile, India has en-

The Indian Objective 
From New Delhi's point of 
view, pressure on Pakistan is 
a conservative means of ex-
pressing Indian anger at Western 
policy in the area. Public 
sentiment against Pakistan is 
strong and Kashmir has long 
been a local issue between the 
two countries. India is, and 
can expect to remain, dominant 
in its efforts against the 
Baghdad pact and promoting op-
position to SEATO in Cambodia. 
Pakistan's Reaction 
Pakistan's reaction to 
India's tactics may result in 
the United States and USSR lin-
ing up on opposite sides on 
the Kashmir issue. Nehru's 
closing of the door on Kashmir 
has already resulted in Paki-
stan's deciding to return the 
Kashmir issue to the UN Se-
curity Council. There India, 
probably backed by the USSR, 
will face Pakistan, which will 
probably consider the amount 
of Western support as an index 
to its future relations with 
the West.

clear on 6 April in the National 
Assembly. Facing a barrage of 
criticism on his handling of 
Indian moves against Pakistan, 
he said simply: "I am sure our 
friends, the Americans ,are 
quite capable of dealing with 
such tactics." 
The border incidents pro-
voked by a militarily more 
powerful India will almost cer-
tainly inspire Pakistani leaders 
to greater efforts to turn 
American military assistance 
into channels designed to pro-
mote strength against India 
rather than the USSR. 
Pakistani officials have 
said they intend to bring up 
the Kashmir question at the 16 
April meeting of the Baghdad 
pact in Tehran. The amount of 
support for Pakistani aims given 
there by the West 1411 probably 
be looked upon as another indi-
cator of future relations. 
Mohammad All has already indi-
cated that he does not intend 
to act on the long-pending 
Treaty of Friendship, Commerce 
and Navigation with the US 
until he returns from Tehran. 
JAPAN COMPETES FOR SOLE 
The Japanese government 
has well-defined plans for the 
economic development of South 
and Southeast Asia--a region 
:where Communist economic pene-
tration is beginning to have 
an impact, but where Britain 
and West Germany still offer 
Japan its stiffest competition. 
Tokyo's plans are to open new 
sources of supply for cheap raw 
materials and to stimulate the 
Asian market for Japanese goods. 
But these plans are likely to 
fall far short of their poten-
tial unless the government is 
willing to devote greater fi-
nancial resources to developing 
such trade than in the past. 
The Future 
In the current atmosphere 
of disillusion and doubt over 
the future of SEATO and the 
Baghdad pact, failure of the 
West to "produce" as Pakistan 
and other interested states 
feel it should could result 
in the Asian members of the 
pacts abandoning any sincere 
effort to achieve the aim of 
the pacts--defense against 
Communism. 
If Nehru finds that his 
policy of talking against the 
pacts to the West and making 
his opposition to them felt in 
action against Pakistan is 
frustrated by strong Western 
support for Pakistan on Kash-
mir, he may, as he has in the 
past, attempt to evolve a new 
approach in line with his 
neutralist principles. How-
ever, he will also be greatly 
tempted to undertake a policy 
of closer economic and political 
co-operation with the USSR, pos-
sibly including purchase of 
Soviet arms. 
IN ASIAN DEVELOPMENT 
Financing 
A prime problem exists in 
how to pay for the large re-
quired imports of raw materials, 
plus construction, installation 
and other costs in the countries 
which receive aid from Tokyo. 
Japan would be financially able 
to support technical assistance 
projects and an increased vol-
ume of long-term loans and in-
vestments if the Hatoyama gov-
ernment were willing to lessen 
its present high priority for 
social welfare and other domes-
tic programs.

Japanese businessmen are 
neither willing nor able to in-
vest in South and Southeast Asia 
in any great numbers without 
political and economic stability 
in those countries, guarantees 
against expropriations, repatri-
ation of profits and participa-
tion in management. Rates of 
return on loans and investments 
must be more nearly commensurate 
with those in Japan, where rates 
are high, unless government as-
sistance is forthcoming. 
Tokyo's Plans 
Current trade: Tokyo's 
agreement to pay certain repara-
tions and embark on a program 
of economic co-operation with 
underdeveloped Asian countries 
stems from the view that trade 
between Japan and the rest of 
Asia has about reached the max-
imum under present conditions. 
In the Japanese fiscal 
year 1954-55, South 
and Southeast Asia 
bought only $46,000,-
000 of Japan's total 
capital goods exports 
of $167,000,000. The 
Japanese estimate that 
they could increase 
capital goods output 
by $633,000,000 over 
the 1954 level with-
out having to expand 
existing capacity.

has not moved much 
beyond the planning 
stage. In formulating 
its plans, moreover, 
Tokyo counts first of 
all on a large Ameri-
can dollar contribu-
tion. In addition, 
it hopes payments to 
the United States for 
postwar economic aid 
(GARIOA) and yen funds 
from the sale of US sur-
plus agricultural com-
modities will be 
loaned back to Japan 
or used directly by 
the United States to procure 
Japanese goods for Smith and 
Southeast Asia. 
Reparations: Reparations 
payments are likely to be the 
government's principal contri-
bution to Asian economic devel-
opment. A $250,000,000-agree-
ment with Burma, a $27,000,000-
debt settlement with Thailand, 
and an impending $800,000,000-
agreement with the Philippines 
are all payable in goods and 
services, a portion of which is 
to consist of Japanese long-
term loans and investments. In 
addition, a substantial settle-
ment will eventually have to be 
made with Indonesia and a lesser 
one with South Vietnam. In Ja-
pan's fiscal 1956-57 budget, 
$42,000,000 has already been set 
aside for reparations, most of 
it earmarked for Burma.

for reparations, the Japanese 
government has placed primary

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
12 April 1956 
efforts are likely to be con-
fined to less costly industrial 
projects for which financing is 
available on terms competitive 
with those of Britain and West 
Germany. 
Communist competition in 
the Indian market has not yet 
affected the Japanese seriously. 
Last year, India's trade with 
the Soviet Union reportedly 
amounted to only one third of 
India's trade with Japan. Brit-
ain and West Germany were in 
fact the more formidable com-
petitors. There are strong 
indications, however, that 
Communist economic penetration 
will increase. 
Burma: Rice is the key 
to foF5TER competition in the 
Burmese market. It comprises 
80 percent of Burma's exports. 
With Moscow's recent agreement 
to increase its purchases to 
400,000 tons this year, the 
Sino-Soviet bloc will take at 
least one third of Burma's total 
rice exports. This figure may 
even become as high as one half 
in succeeding years. Communist 
countries are thus in a posi-
tion to gain a major share of 
Burma's capital goods' market 
despite Burma's preference for 
dealing with the West. 
Communist deliveries to 
date have been minimal, but are 
expected to gather momentum this 
year. In addition to making 
token payments of rice for such 
Soviet gifts as a technological 
institute and a medical center, 
the Burmese government tenta-
-tively plans to procure $40,-
000,000 worth of capital goods 
from the bloc in 1956. This is 
about one half of itS total 
planned public capital imports. 
It has already accepted a Chi-
nese Communist offer to expand 
a textile mill near Rangoon. 
The details of Burma's 
utilization of its barter cred-
its with the USSR will be worked 
Out when a high-level Soviet 
planning mission visits Rangoon 
in May. The Burmese may seek 
Russian aid for the establish-
ment of a tractor factory and 
truck assembly plant and for 
the enlargement of a steel mill. 
The Chinese and Soviet programs 
may be supplemented to a lesser 
extent by the Satellites, which 
have also purchased Burmese 
rice. 
Other Countries: In other 
count=a-br$buth and South-
east Asia, Communist economic 
penetration is still just a 
black cloud on Japan's horizon. 
The chief source of anxiety 
for Japan is Chinese Communist 
exports of light consumer goods. 
Many Asian governments, partic-
ularly those having declining 
agricultural and raw materials 
prices, are becoming increas:. 
ingly tempted to strike a neu-
tralist pose to obtain economic 
assistance from both sides. 
In all cases, ability to 
pay for imports in foodstuffs 
and raw materials and the will-
ingness of foreign nations to 
extend credit on liberal terms 
are the determining factors in 
Asian economic planning. The 
ideological factor plays,' at 
most, a minor role. Communist 
technicians and trade represent-
atives have so far behaved 
correctly and given no cause 
for complaint on political 
grounds. 
Western Competition 
..,,Britain and West Germany 
still offer Japan its stiffest 
competition in most of Asia, 
both as to price and quality. 
Their reluctance or inability 
to extend latge credits has . 
helped Tokyo to retain its lead 
1711 total trade, except against 
Britain in formerly British-
controlled areas. 
The Hatoyama government's 
proposal for an Asian develop-
ment corporation and its posi-
tive attitude on reparations 
should assure the Japanese a 
more important economic role

'PEIPING ATTEMPTS TO OVERCOME 
Communist China's First 
Five-Year Plan (1953-1957) 
places great emphasis on the 
development of petroleum re-
sources. Annual production 
of crude oil increased from 
120,000 tons in 1949 to 980,-
000 tons in 1955, but sharply 
rising consumption still forced 
China to import 57 percent of 
its requirements last year. 
This dependence on imports has 
been a major military vulner-
ability and a strain on over-
land transport from the USSR. 
Reserves  
Peiping has undertaken an 
ambitious program of prospect-
ing and exploration, optimis-
tically Lloping to locate a 
total petroleum reserve of 
55,000,000 tons by 1957. This 
quantity, which is far larger 
than previous estimates of 
proved reserves, would probably 
meet refinery demands for 
several decades in China, even 
though it would be only nine 
months' supply for the USSR 
and two months' for the United 
States. 
PART III 
PETROLEUM DEFICIENCY 
Considerable publicity 
has attended the search for 
oil in the remote Tsaidam 
Basin of Tsinghai Province, 
where crude oil of good quality 
reportedly has been discovered. 
The recent decision to build 
a 930-mile railroad from Lan-
chow into the Tsaidam Basin 
may have been prompted by oil 
discoveries.

annual production of 980,000 
tons of crude oil in 1955 is 
slightly more than the average 
daily production in the United 
States. 
Considerable effort has 
been expended to rehabilitate 
the Manchurian synthetic oil 
facilities, most of which were 
looted by the Soviet army in 
1945. In 1955 crude shale oil 
accounted for about 95 percent 
of the total production of 
synthetic crude oil and over 
40 percent of the total crude 
oil production in China. In 
view of the abundant resources 
of oil shale at Fushun, some 
further expansion of oil shale 
processing plants is expected. 
Because of their high operating 
costs, however, greater emphasis

and tneir proportionate con-

Development of the Yumen 
oil field, China's only im-
portant producer of natural 
crude oil, has been delayed 
by poor communications with 
markets in eastern China. How-
ever, the Lanchow-Sinkiang 
railroad will probably reach 
Yumen in mid-1956. By 1960 
production may be double the 
1955 output of 480,000 tons.

Imports and Consumption 
About half of Communist 
China's petroleum imports in 
1955 were delivered thousands 
of miles via the Trans-Siberian 
Railroad, the remainder origi-
nating in Soviet Far East re-
fineries or coming by tanker 
from the Black Sea. These 
imports, constituting about 30 
percent of the volume of all 
60409 3 
Chinese imports, are a signifi-
cant strategic liability and 
a heavy cost to the Sino-Soviet 
bloc. 
In the first few years 
of the Communist regime, con-
sumption of petroleum products 
was drastically restricted by 
severe rationing and use of 
substitute fuels wherever pos-
sible. In recent years, as 
the supply has improved, ra-
tioning has been eased and 
prices reduced. Industry and 
transportation has sharply 
increased their use of petroleum, 
and Peiping has announced that 
users of lamp kerosene increased 
from 90,000,000 in 1950 to 380,-
000,000 in 1953. 
Because of the limitation 
to greatly increased imports 
and difficulties in expanding 
the petroleum industry, con-
sumption is still closely con-
trolled, and petroleum will con-
tinue for the foreseeable future 
to be a much less prominent 
source of energy for the Chi-
nese economy than it is for 
the USSR or the United States.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
12 April 1956 
BRAZILS?  FOREIGN POLICY 
President Kubitschek's 
first 60 days as head of the 
Brazilian government have re-
vealed his intention to ex-
pand commercial relations with 
Western Europe and the Soviet 
bloc. There are indications 
that he will seek at the same 
time to strengthen Brazil's 
traditional ties with the 
United States. 
Kubitschek's failure dur-
ing? his election campaign to 
disclaim support of the corrupt 
Vargas machine and of certain 
Communist elements had aroused 
such strong antagonisms in 
Brazil that for several months 
before and after the 3 October 
presidential election there 
were persistent reports of prep-
arations for a military coup. 
Since his inauguration on 31 
January, rumors of impending 
coups have been far fewer. 
Relations With US  
During the campaign, 
Kubitschek had promised an 
extensive economic development 
program for Brazil--"50 years 
of progress in five." His 
major foreign policy objectives 
seem to be to obtain the eco-
nomic assistance to make good 
this promise. In this, he 
seems likely to turn to those 
countries offering the most 
help in tackling Brazil's 
enormous foreign exchange and 
development problems. 
Although Kubitschek is 
considered more Europe-oriented 
than were presidents Dutra and 
Vargas, he looks to the United 
States as his major source of 
economic assistance. He has 
already asked Washington's 
help in expanding agricultural 
production and storage facili-
ties, in refunding Brazil's 
external debt, and in meeting 
investment goals totaling over 
a billion dollars. To smooth 
his relations with the United 
UNDER KUBITSCHEK 
States, Kubitschek apparently 
intends to move as far as pos-
sible from the ultranational-
istic policies of Vargas. 
Kubitschek's foreign min-
ister is regarded as strongly 
pro-US, but the degree of his 
own support for American poli-
cies in international affairs 
is not yet clear. However, he 
agreed to oppose the seating of 
a Chinese Communist delegation 
at the International Parlia-
mentary Union meeting in Yugo-
slavia. 
Relations With Europe 
While looking to the United 
States as his major source of 
aid, Kubitschek hopes to tap 
Western European sources as 
well. This was illustrated by 
his pre-inaugural tour of 
Europe following his visit to 
the US. Kubitschek also ap-
pears eager to expand the 
"limited convertibility area" 
trading arrangement now in ef-
fect between Brazil and a Euro-
pean group composed of Britain, 
West Germany, Belgium and the 
Netherlands. 
In late March, Kubitschek 
followed up earlier conversa-
tions in Bonn with West German 
industrialists by negotiating 
the establishment of a large 
Krupp subsidiary and four Bayer 
chemical plants and the expan-
sion of a Brazilian steel mill 
by Ferrostaal. Krupp has 
agreed to co-operate with 
Kubitschek in his transporta-
tion and power programs by 
constructing locomotives, trucks, 
buses, tractors and turbines. 
The American embassy in Rio de 
Janeiro believes West German 
investment in Brazil in 1956 
might outstrip new American 
investment activity. 
The West German government 
has agreed to supply geologists 
for Brazil's still ineffective

national petroleum monopoly, 
Petrobras. Although Kubitschek 
is believed by some observers 
to be willing to throw petro-
leum open to private investment, 
the step is considered politi-
cally risky at present. Foreign 
involvement in this important 
field will probably continue 
to be limited to loans and 
technical aid. French interests 
have already supplied equipment 
for one Petrobras refinery and 
are considering financing 
another in conjunction with 
Belgian and Italian interests. 
Relations With Soviet Bloc  
Kubitschek has been under 
mounting public pressure to ex-
pand trade with the Soviet bloc. 
This pressure has increased 
since Bulganin's overtures to 
Latin America in January and 
the US announcement of its 
surplus cotton disposal program. 
The subject of Soviet trade and 
diplomatic relations has become 
a major Communist-front theme, 
in which over 20 non-Communist 
deputies have become involved. 
Kubitschek has publicly 
stated his desire to use trade 
with the Soviet bloc as a means 
to solve pressing surplus and 
foreign exchange problems. 
Diplomatic ties, however--ex-
cept those that exist with 
Czechoslovakia and Poland--will 
depend on congress, according to 
Kubitschek. He told newsmen in 
February that relations with 
other bloc countries would be 
"a step I will not initiate." 
Soon after Kubitschek's 
inauguration, the Soviet 
embassy in London asked to 
meet the Brazilian ambassador 
there to "clear up any past 
misunderstandings." This was 
interpreted as a Soviet move to 
resume relations which Brazil 
broke off in 1948. The Brazilian 
ambassador was instructed to 
confine himself to listening, 
according to Foreign Ministry 
officials. 
The Czechs and Poles both 
sent delegations to the inaugu-
ration,and Prague is reliably 
reported to have laid plans to 
exploit Kubitschek's ancestral 
ties to improve relations. 
The plan was abandoned, however, 
when it was learned that he 
had no sentimental attachment 
for Czechoslovakia. 
Kubitschek's Foreign Min-
istry appointees appear grati-
fied by the Soviet bloc offers 
but aware that past arrange-
ments have not always improved 
Brazil's trade position. They 
recently denounced an official 
trade agreement with Czech-
oslovakia in order to revise 
unfavorable exchange rates. 
Nevertheless, new trade 
agreements are under considera-
tion. / 
preliminary trade talks with 
the Soviet Union are being 
carried on between Brazilian 
and Soviet diplomats in Argen-
tina. Poland, Hungary and 
East Germany have offered to 
buy surplus cotton and coffee 
In exchange for needed indus-
trial equipment.
