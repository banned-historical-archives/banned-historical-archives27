 ARAB-ISRAELI  ISSUE
 MOSCOW TAKES CAUTIOUS STANCE ON HEIGHTENED MIDEAST TENSION
 Soviet media kept a low profile in treating the increased tension
 in the Middle East late last week after Western and Arab news
 reports of partial Israeli mobilization to face unspecified
 Syrian moves.   Moscow's behavior suggested a strong element of
 Soviet concern about a possible outbreak of hostilities.   Thus,
 while TASS on the 16th did acknowledge reports of the Israeli
 mobilization, reportage was kept to a minimum and Soviet media
 refrained from comment until the 18th,  as tension was subsiding.
 On the other hand, Moscow has reacted to recent Israeli attacks on
 Lebanon with the usual routine charges of premeditated aggression,
 in effect implicitly suggesting that such raids would not
 demonstrably affect the Arab-Israeli status quo.
 SOVIET COMMENT      Moscow's first comment on the tense situation
 last week came in a foreign-language commentary
 by Zholkver on the 18th which predictably accused Israel of
 heightening tension by mobilizing reserves anc'. "massing troops"
 on the Syrian-Israeli cease-fire line.   Zholkver claimed that one
 Israeli objecti.ve was to use the alleged threat of Syrian attack
 as a convenient excuse for its own military preparations.   But
 the commentator did not directly assert that these moves meant an
 Israeli attack, instead professing to see as a second objective
 the desire to attract more foreign military aid and to distract
 public opinion from the UNGA debate on the Palestinian question
 and from the "serious economic and political upheaval at home."
 Moscow press comment on the 19th, as reviewed by TASS, took much
 the same tack:   RED STAR asserted that Israel wished to cover up
 "preparations for another war" and to divert attention from domestic
 problems, and TRUD saw the latest Israeli "provocations and threats"
 as timed for the UNGA debate.   IZVESTIYA's Beirut correspondent
 attributed to "local political observers" the view that Israeli
 leaders had decided to settle external and internal problems through
 "tension and war."
 The same IZVESTIYA dispatch said that Arab capitals were taking
 seriously the possibility of an Israeli preemptive strike, chiefly
 against Syria.   Going somewhat beyond this, a Timoshkin commentary
 broadcast to Arab audiences on the 18th called it important, as
 the Arab press put it, "not to allow Israel to take the Arabs by
 surprise."   Timoshkin said it was necessary to maintain vigilance

 and preparedness "to give a decisive reply" to the "likely
 aggression."  But at the same time, he urged that the Arabs and
 their friends also continue efforts for a peaceful settlement
 within the framework of the Geneva conference, and he reiterated
 previous Soviet criticism of "so-called quiet diplomacy or
 partial solutions."
 Moscow responded only at the lowest propaganda level--a Radio
 Peace and Progress broadcast in Arabic on the 18th--to Israeli
 Prime Minister Rabin's "accusation that the Soviet Union is
 playing with fire" in continuing "comprehensive assistance" to
 the Arab countries. The commentary portrayed Israel as concerned
 over Soviet support for the Arabs and thus attempting to disrupt
 Arab-Soviet friendship, and in turn charged that through the
 flow of American arms to Israel "certain U.S. quarters" were
 encouraging Israel to new military adventures.
 REPORTAGE ON      Moscow typically gave no publicity to its diplomatic
 DEVELOPMENTS      approaches, reported by Egypt's MIDDLE EAST NEWS
 AGENCY.  MENA reported on the 16th that President
 as-Sadat had replied to messages from Brezhnevand from President
 Ford, and other MENA dispatches noted chat Syrian President al-Asap'
 had received the Soviet ambassador on the 16th and was handed a
 message from Brezhnev on the following evening.
 Initial TASS and Moscow radio accounts of Secretary Kissinger's
 15 November press conference gave no indication that he had
 responded to questions about the possibility of new hostilities
 in the Middle East, but a subsequent TASS report on the 16th did
 note that he said the situation remained serious.  TASS cited him
 as pointing out that the United States could not agree with the
 idea that the problems of the area could be solved by military
 means, and that the United States would use its influence to prevent
 the increase of military activity.  TASS did not report his remark
 that the United States expected other countries "that have any
 influence" to use it to restrain belligerents in the region.   But it
 did note that the Secretary expressed the opinion that the forthcoming
 Brezhnev-Ford meeting in Vladivostok would have "a favorable influence"
 on the Middle East situation.
 Events in the area were summed up in a TASS dispatch from Beirut
 later on the 16th which was replayed in abbreviated form in Moscow
 radio domestic and Arabic-language newscasts.   The TASS item picked
 up Lebanese press charges of Israeli military actions h;:ightening

 tension on both the Lebanese and Syrian borders.*  The same
 dispatch, under a New York dateline, attributed to U.S. newt
 agencies the report of a partial mobilization in Israel, noted
 "threats" by Israeli Prime Minister Rabin against Syria, and
 not unexpectedly drew attention to American press reports of
 "i+ninterrupted deliveries of offensive armaments" by the United
 Scates to Israel.
 A broadcast in Arabic the same day claimed that Rabin had said
 in a speech that Israel would take preemptive measures against
 Syria, but the newscast seemed to soften this somewt.at by citing
 "many observers" as believing this "whipping up of military
 tysteria" was due to the Palestinian debate in the United Nations.
 On the 17th another multi-datelined TASS dispatch--from Damascus,
 Beirut, Cairo and New York--rounded up the situation.   From
 Damascus, TASS noted Syrian Foreign Minister Khaddam's statement
 that Israel in the past 24 hours had unleashed a "vicious campaign"
 to cover up its "intended aggression" and that Syria reiterated
 its commitment regarding the cease-fire, and would repel any
 Israeli aggression.  Noting that Egyptian President as-Sadat had
 met with top advisers to discuss the situation, TASS said it was
 believed in Cairo that Israel's "massive" troop concentrations and
 callup of "a great number of reservists" indicated an Israeli
 intent to begin a new aggression.
 UNDOF MANDATE,      Moscow has not touched on the question of Syrian
 GENEVA TALKS        intentions with regard to renewing the UNDOF--UN
 Disengagement Observer Force--mandate on the Golan
 Heights at the end of the month, which Israeli spokesmen have made
 clear they regard as a critical issue.   The Beirut daily AN-NAHAR on
 the 18th reported "diplomatic sources" as saying Syria would agree to
 UNDOF extension for three to six months under three conditions:
 resumption of the Geneva conference with no political negotiations
 outside its framework; adoption of a timetable for Israeli
 *  Since it is not. uncommon for Moscow to pass along Lebanese press
 accusations of alleged Israeli actions of aggressive intent, the
 appearance of such reports at times of increased tension would not
 necessarily constitute indicators of imminent hostilities.  As
 recently as 9 November TASS was citing the Lebanese press for reports
 that Israel was intensifying military preparations on both Lhe
 Lebanese and Syrian borders, and had not yet withdrawn reserve
 troops which had participated in recent  Israeli exercises on the Golan
 Heights.

 withdrawal; and guarantee of the Palestinians' legitimate rights.
 Moscow has apparently not picked up this report, but TASS on the
 18th noted without comment that Egyptian Foreign Minister Fahmi,
 in an interview with the Cairo weekly ROSE AL-YUSUF, reportedly
 said that Egypt considered the Geneva conference "the only possible
 forum" for discussions and would adhere to this stand "in all its
 forthcoming diplomatic contacts."
 USSR PRAISES "CONSTRUCTIVE PROGRAM" OFFERED BY PLO AT UNGA
 Soviet comment on the current UNGA debate of the Palestinian
 question has stressed the significance of the PLO delegation's
 appearance at the United Nations and has been virtually unanimous
 in emphasizing that PLO Chairman Iasi;: 'Arafat presented a
 "constructive program" for solving the issue in his 13 November
 speech opening the scheduled two-week debate.  At the same time,
 however, Moscow has conveyed its continued reservations on some
 points in the PLO "program," principally the advisability of using
 terror as a political weapon and the practicality of the nature and
 boundaries of a new Palestinian state.*
 Soviet media have stressed the general theme that the PLO has gained
 increa3ed international prestige and stature through the UNGA
 decisions to debate the Palestinian question as a political issue--not
 a refugee problem, as in the past--and to invite the PLO to attend
 the debate and address the General Assembly in plenary session,
 thus breaking with'the precedent. that had limited such appearances
 to representatives of recognized governments.  Comment has also
 pointed out that recent PLO diplomatic successes were made possible
 by external political support, primarily from the USSR, and by the
 PLO's own development of a "realistic approach" to achieving its
 goals.
 Typifying this line, a 14 November IZVESTIYA article by V. Shmarov
 hailed the UNGA debate as a "portentous event" reflecting a "new
 approach" to the Palestinian aspect of a Mideast settlement.  Claiming
 *  Given its current insistence on the PLO's "realistic" approach, and
 its past expressions of disapproval of Palestinian "extremist" actions,
 Moscow presumably was embarrassed over the Palestinian terrorist
 operation in Bet She'an on the 19th.  The sole Soviet reference thus far,
 a New York-datelined TASS dispatch on the 19th, cited a PLO delegation
 spokesman as expressing indignation over "the murder of four Palestine
 Arabs by the occupants of Bet She'an," with no explanation of the
 circumstances.

 to cite Arab press sources, Shmarov asserted that the Palestinian
 question had been included on the UNGA agenda "only" because of
 Soviet efforts.   In an apparent reference to PLO acceptance of the
 UNGA invitation, as well as to increased PLO willingness in recent
 months to use diplomatic leverage in its conflict with Israel,
 Shma ov praised the PLO for "attentively listening to the voice of
 world opinion" and for "formulating a realistic approach to political
 solutions," noting in this context that "this inner evolution of
 the PLO is contributing" to its growing international prestige and
 acceptance.
 PLO "PROGRAM"      Soviet comment has professed to see the PLO's
 new "realistic approach" as being exemplified
 by 'Arafat's "constructive program," principally the three major
 appeals at the conclusion of his speech, asking for international
 support to assure the Palestinians' right "to determine their own
 fate," "to return from their compulsory exile" to their homelan~,
 and "to establish their independent national authority and found
 their national entity on their land."  At the same time, however,
 Moscow has reiterated its position that a final Mideast settlement
 will have to include the satisfaction of the interests of "all the
 states and peoples" in this region.  Moscow Ii,--is thus not extended
 its public support to the PLO's frequently expressed "ultimate
 aim"--reiterated implicitly in 'Arafat's speech--of replacing
 present-day Israel with a restored Palestine of pre-partition
 (November 1947) days and establishing, in 'Arafat's words, a
 "single democratic and progressive state" for Moslems, Christians,
 and "all the Jews who now live in Palestine."
 Indications that Moscow stands by its long-expressed support for
 Israel's existence as a state have appeared in remarks by PRAVDA
 and IZVESTIYA commentators.   On Ifoscow radio's "International
 Situation" program on 16 November, PRAVDA political observer
 Mayevskiy noted that the Arab countries have been divided over the
 questicn of "what sort of administration the territories west of
 the Jordan River should have after their liberation from Israeli
 occupation," as well as the question of whether Jordan or the PLO
 should represent the Palestinians.  Citing the "unanimous" decision
 of the Rabat Arab summit conference that the Palestinians "have the
 right to their own national home on the West Bank of the Jordan
 River and in the Gaza Strip," Mayevskiy said the Soviet Union
 supported the Rabat decisions.  Mayevskiy seemed to be making the
 point that the USSR accepts the notion of a Palestinian entity only
 within the confines of the West Bank and Gaza.   In going on to
 discuss 'Arafat's "constructive program," "Iayevskiy pointedly made
 no mention of the last point on national authority and national  entity,
 referring only to the right to self-determination and to return to
 their native land.

 20 NOVEMBER 1974
 Also suggestive was IZVESTIYA commentator Mikhaylov's  remark,
 on the 17 November Moscow radio observers' roundtable.  In the
 course of refuting "slander" spread about the character of the
 Palestine liberation movement, he cryptically noted that aims had
 been attributed to it "which it has not and is not setting
 itself"--perhaps an oblique reference to the PLO call for a
 democratic and progressive state in all Palestine.  Mikhaylov also
 complained that the Palestinian movement had been equated with
 "tha terrorist actions of extremist groups."
 Other comment has also charged Israel with slandering the Palestinians
 in the course of pointing up Israel's hostile reaction to the PLO
 appearance at the United Nations and Tel Aviv's refusal to talk
 with the PLO "except on the battlefield."  Soviet media have
 accused Israel of failing to accept "the reality" of the Mideast
 situation and of doing everything possible to prevent a peaceful
 solution.  As a result of its unrealis*ic and "aggressive" policies,
 Moscow claims that Israel, is locking itself into a state of
 political isolation and severe economic difficulties.

 SC-\%1ET ROCKET TROOPS CONWIANDER DENIES SALT DECEPTION
 Asserting that "not a single silo" has been constructed in the Soviet
 Union since May 1972, General Ivan Tolubko, Commander-in-Chief of the
 Soviet Strategic Missile Forces, has strongly denied that the Soviet
 Union has violated the strategic arms limitation agreement.  Responding
 to charges reportedly made in the United States recently, Tolubko de-
 clared, in an interview published in the 11-17 November issue of
 NEDELYA, that the Soviet Union has never violated its obligations
 and will certainly not do so on such an "important political issue"
 as the interim agreement on the limitation of strategic offensive
 arms.
 U.S. CHARGES     Although the denial was purportedly prompted by
 recent statements in the United States, including--
 as Tolubko himself specified--a speech by Senator James L. Buckley
 to the Overseas Prt..s Club on 31 October,  it is clear that broader
 considerations were also involved.  For some two years now, accord-
 ing to an article by Michael Getter in the WASHINGTON POST on
 1 November, there has been a controversy among Western experts over
 the purpose of certain structures which the Soviets have been in-
 stalling at some missile sites.  Recently,                                General George S. Brown,
 chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and William Beecher, DOD
 press spokesman, took note of this controversy and publicly denied
 that the Soviet Union was violating the SALT agreements.
 Tolubko referred to this controversy obliquely in a statement which
 seemed intended to absolve the U.S. Government of blame for encourag-
 ing suspicions of Soviet intentions.  Describing such suspicions as
 the "fabrications" of the "enemies of detente," he pointed out that
 the "representatives of the Pentagon, Brown and Beecher" had specifical-
 ly refuted them.  He immediately took away whatever magnanimity this
 acknowledgement was intended to convey, however, by adding acerbicly
 that this was the first time "in over two years" that such a refutation
 had been volunteered by U.S. authorities.
 OTHER ISSUES      Elsewhere Tolubko struck. a generally optimistic note
 in his references to U.S.-Soviet relations.  Although
 he did charge that the purposes of the anti--Soviet accusations being
 made in the United States were to undermine the Soviet peace policy
 and to justify U.S. arms programs, he ir.dicatLd, by his reference to
 the Brown and Beecher statements, that these purposes were not shared

 by the U.S. Government.   He went on to refer approvingly to the
 forthcoming meeting between President Ford and Brezhnev at
 Vladivostok, and he stated that "all the Soviet people" were
 behind the detente policy and believed that it should be made
 an "irreversible" process.
 Tolubko refrained from commenting in detail -on other.specific
 charges which he said had been made against the Soviet Union.
 Apart from his denial that the Soviet Union had constructed new
 silos, he made only one other specific denial--that the Soviet
 Union was "conducting any tests of new mobile intercontinental
 systems."  For the rest, he treated the charges as not worth
 dignifying with specific rebuttals.
 On other military issues, to which the interview as a whole was
 addressed, Tolubko made two rather expansive claims.  One was that
 the Soviet missile forces were kept in a state of "constant combat
 readiness" which enabled them to launch weapons within seconds or
 even fractions of a second after receiving a battle order.  The
 other was that "all" combat training launches over the last few
 years had been completed with marks of either "excellent" or "good."

 EAST-NEST                     RELATIONS
 BL.OC'S CALL FOR INITIAL TROOP CUT IN 1975 CALLED "REASONABLE"
 In an obvious effcrt to put public pressure on the NATO states at
 the Vienna force reduction negotiations, Moscow and its East
 European allies have insistently argued that NATu should negotiate
 on the basis of the new Warsaw Pact "initial step" force reduction
 proposal offered in Vienna on 31 October.   Comment has stressed
 the reasonableness and readiness for compromise on the part of
 the East European states in their attempt to unlock the stalemated
 MBFR talks, contrasting this with the announcement by Secretary
 Schlesinger during his recent visit to the FRG that the United
 States would be increasing the combat strength of its forces in
 West Germany.
 An article by the chief GDR delegate to the Vienna talks explicitly
 pointed out that the new proposal need set no precedent for any
 future agreements, and that it allows the NATO states to retain
 the basic provisions of their negotiating posir-on.  Other authorita-
 tive statements, by Moscow and Warsaw spokesmen, have reiterated
 the linkage between MBFR and CSCE which Gromyko broached in his
 October Revolution anniversary speech on 6 November.
 OESER iIORIZONT ARTICLE:  NO      The article by the head of the GDR
 RENUNCIATION OF PRINCIPLES        delegation in Vienna, Ingo Oeser,
 in the East Berlin weekly HORIZONT
 (Nc. 47,  signed to press -11. November), included the longest apologia
 for the new Fact proposal to date.  After a detailed review of the
 standing NATO and Pact proposals, Oeser wrote that the Pact, with
 its new ;proposal, was suggesting "an independei,t agreement on an
 initial step" for reducing forces and arms in 1975, an agreement of
 "limited scope" and one that would "make some allowance" for the
 negotiating position of the Western states.   OeseL? listed only two
 conditions for the Pact's limited agreement:   first, the vague,
 but customary, Pact stipulation that no agreement giving the NATO
 states one-sided advantages would be permissible; and second, all
 11 negotiating Vienna participants "must" contribute to the mutual
 reduction.
 Continuing, Oeser pointed out that an initial reduction agreement
 would include a commitment by all participants to work toward a
 more comprehensive agreement.  Appealing to Western proponents of

 immediate force red"-tions, while reassuring them that initial
 steps would not p --,:JLce fundamental positions, Oeser declared:
 Moreover, it [the limited agreement] must expressly
 stipulate that through its provisions no precedent
 will be set for future agreements.  Thus the
 socialist states uphold their just basic positions
 on an overall settlement, as contained in their
 draft agreement, and do not make it a precondition
 for the agreement of an initial step that the
 capitalist participating states renounce their
 overall position.
 Concluding, Oeser observed that the "important" Pact initiative
 displayed "great flexibility" and "made allowance--within the
 scope of what was feasible--for a number of elements" in the
 West's position.  He called upon the West now to demonstrate
 "an accommodating attitude" toward the new initiative and to
 declare its readiness to work out an initial agreement.   "The
 socialist states are ready for discussion," Oeser rema:-ked,
 perhaps implying a Pact willingness for compromise even on the
 new proposal.
 Notably, in the context of his discussion on the new proposal,
 Oeser made no explicit reference to either the inclusion of air
 and nuclear-armed forces or to the Pact demand that after any
 future reduction all 11 participating states could no longer
 exceed the then established strength of their forces and arms in
 central Europe--the stipulation which in effect precludes any
 future reorganization or regrouping of forces among the NATO
 states or in any possible future West European defense organiza-
 tion.  But as Oeser made clear, these basic elements of the Pact's
 original proposal would not be-excluded at this time from the
 formal Pact position in working out a more comprehensive agreement.
 STRULAK INTERVIEW;        In another authoritative assessment of the
 MBFR-CSCE LINKAGE         new initiative, Warsaw's delegate to
 Vienna, Tadeusz Strulak, who has acted in
 the past as the chief public spokesman for the East on this issue,
 argued in an interview published in the Vienna daily KURIER on
 the 9th that the Pact was not trying to sell dead stock under a
 new label with its first step proposal; he observed that "we
 thought it advisable to now give our consent to first [step]
 reductions."  But more significantly, Strulak went on to make an
 unusual statement on the motives behind the recent Vienna

 initiative.   In response to a question on the reciprocal relation-
 ship between MBFR and CSCE made by Gromyko on the 6th, Strulak
 went beyond Gromyko's remarks in clearly pointing out that the
 recent Pact initiative in Vienna was part of an overall strategy.
 Strulak said:   "Yes.   One motive of our proposal was the considera-
 tion that progress at the Vienna talks could also lead to a
 success in Geneva--just as, in turn, progress in Geneva would
 certainly positively affect the negotiations in Vienna."  Strulak
 added that "both conferences must be viewed in context of the
 global efforts of the two great powers."
 The Pact's new MBFR proposal and Strulak's remark-, at a mimimum,
 clearly set the stage for Moscow to argues that, on the one hand,
 the socialist states have made an effort to meet certain i'ATO
 demands at Vienna and thus it is now the West 's turn for some
 "give" either at MBFR or the Geneva CSCE negotiations; and on the
 other, that Moscow has now offered a proposal which can bolster
 the policy of detente in the military field.
 NATO REACTION "CONDEMNED"      As for the NATO reaction to the new
 Pact initiative at the MBFR plenary
 sessions on the 7th and 14th, Prague media have apparently been
 assigned the role of reporting publicly the. West's negative
 response.   RUDE PRAVO on the 8th, in a CTK dispatch from Vienna,
 reported that the British representative had declared that "the
 West has not found" in the new proposal "any new elements."  The
 Czechoslovak delegate, R. Klein, was reported as saying that it
 was impossible "to ignore the significant new elements" of the
 proposal, that the vJest's reaction demonstrates the lack of
 "necessary realism and flexibility," and that the West continues
 to insist upon an "unrealistic" and "unacceptable" basis for the
 negotiations.  The vehemence of the Warsaw Pact's reaction to
 the West's response was intensified on the 14th when.Prague radio
 reported that the Hungarijn delegate in Vienna, Janos Petran,
 "condemned" the rejection by the West of the new initiative as
 expressed by the Belgian delegate at that day's plenum.  Then on
 the 15th, in the first signed commentary in the Soviet central press
 on the new Pact proposal, I. Melnikov in PRAVDA wrote that "it has
 become known" that the West "has not yet shown any concrete
 readiness for an agreement on the basis" of the new initiative.
 Melnikov then went on to criticize Secretary Schlesinger's state-
 ments in Bonn, saying that they were "cle- ly at variance with a
 constrictive approach toward the Vienna talks."  Other Soviet and
 East European commentators have similarly criticized Schlesinger's
 remarks.

 BELGRADE CONDEMNS NATO ADRIATIC EXERCISE AS THREAT TO STABILITY
 Yugoslavia has manifested sharp disapproval of the 9-16 November
 NATO maneuvers in the Adriatic.  According to TANJUG, the ranking
 diplomatic envoys of the United States,. Italy, Turkey and Great
 Britain were called in to the Foreign Affairs Secretariat on
 15 November to receive "firm and sharp" protests.  Yugoslav
 media, in the meantime, have backed up the protests with strongly
 critical continent.
 This reaction stands in some contrast to the attitude Yugoslavia
 adopted toward the last NATO exercise in the area--the joint
 U.S.-Italian maneuvers held from 29 March to 5 April this year.
 Although Yugoslavia condemned those maneuvers at the time,  it
 seemed mainly concerned with their hearing on Yugoslav-Italian
 relations, rather than on their implications for general East-
 West relations.   It portrayed the United States as providing
 moral support to Rome in its dispute with Belgrade during a
 flare-up over the recurring Trieste issue..   The current maneuvers,
 on the other hand, have been depicted as a dangerous escalation of
 bloc confrontation, involving for the "first time" a naval
 exercise of a "group" of NATO states in the Adriatic.  TANJUG
 diplomatic editor Budimir, writing on the 16th, scored NATO for
 failing to keep its military activities within accepted boundaries
 rather than expanding to "new areas."
 Predictably, Belgrade assessed the maneuvers as NATO "pressure"
 against Yugoslavia's nonalined position.  Budimir, however,
 introduced a new note in concluding that the maneuvers could also
 be interpreted as pressure on Albania as well.   This adds to the
 evidence that the 4-month old diplomatic flirtation between the
 two countries is continuing.   In the single monitored Tirana comment
 on the maneuvers, ZERI I POPULLIT, according to ATA on the 19th,
 leveled a standard attack against both NATO and the Warsaw Pact,
 failing to mention Yugoslavia by name but expressing concern for
 the "sovereign countries" of the region,

 BLOC MEDIA CONVEY MOSCOW'S REBUFF OF NEW PRC BORDER STANCE
 Moscow itself has not yet acknowledged the PRC's altered public
 stand on the Sino-Soviet border issue contained in the 6 November
 Chinese greetings messag_ to Moscow on the Soviet October Revolution
 anniversary.*  But Soviet disapproval has been communicated
 indirectly in a recent seriss of reports by Moscow's allies that
 publicized refutation of the Chinese position by unnamed Soviet
 officials.   A half dozen reports in Hungarian, Czechoslovak,  and
 GDR media from 13 to 16 November noted that "official circles in
 Moscow" had found the PRC stand merely a "reiteration" of the
 standard Chinese position that has blocked progress in the border
 talks for the past five years and that it is "completely unacceptable
 from the Soviet point of view."  The reports have attacked the
 Chinese motives in publicizing the revised border terms and have
 endeavored to portray the USSR as the truly forthcoming party in
 the border dispute, noting that past Soviet offers were turned
 down by Peking.  In so doing, they have provided the first public
 reference in communist media to a March 1973 Soviet proposal to
 adjust border river boundaries on the eastern part of the frontier
 in a way advantageous to China.
 The bloc reports, denying "sensational" Western press claims that
 the 6 November Chinese greetings represented a new demarche on the
 border issue,  focused on the Soviet officials' objections to the
 linkage implied in the Peking message--that the Chinese were willing
 to consider a Sino-Soviet nonuse of force and nonaggression pact
 together with China's longstanding demand for a withdrawal of
 forces from disputed frontier areas.
 The reports cited Soviet officials as saying that Peking in effect
 was demanding that Pioscow first "give up its present borders"
 under terms of the disputed territories question in exchange for
 Chinese agreement to conclude a nonaggression and nonuse of force
 agreement.   The Moscow correspondent of the Hungarian daily
 NEPSZABADSAG on the 13th said that "Soviet national territory of
 1.5 million square kilometers" would be involved, and tie Moscow
 correspondent of the GDR radio said on the 15th that Peking's demand
 would mean that the border would be moved into the Soviet interior a
 distance of "100 or 200 kilometers."

 the TRENDS of 13 November 1974, pages 3-5.

 The reports have carefully reiterated the Soviet position that
 the present frontier is generally valid and subject only to
 minor adjustments, and have rejected the Chinese claim that
 Kosygin reached an understanding with Chou in SepLember 1969 on
 withdrawal from disputed regions.  The Moscow correspondent
 for the Hungarian news agency MTI reported on the 14th that
 "eyewitnesses" to the Sino-Soviet summit told him no such
 agreement was reached during the September 1969 meeting, adding
 that even though Chou raised a claim in this connection, Kosygin
 did not bargain on the issue.
 To shore up an image contrasting Moscow reasonableness and Peking
 intransigence over the border dispute, the reports have complained
 of Chinese refusal to respond pcsitively to Moscow's   "Fers of
 a nonuse of force pact and nona.gLression agreement, as well as to
 ? Harch 1973 Soviet offer to adjusc the border river boundary on
 the eastern frontier in a way that would give China ownership of
 several hundred disputed border river islands.   The 14 November
 MTI report and a 16 November article in Prague's MLADA FRONTA
 said that Moscow offered to adjust the river boundary "in a way
 customary in international practice" and "by taking into consideration
 the changed river beds" so that the USSR would r1-,-l.re "several
 hundred smaller islands as Chinese territory.'   The reports suggested
 this forthcoming Soviet gesture was "contrary to the treaties
 concluded in the last century between China and Tsarist Russia, "which
 Moscow has held drew the boundary generally along the Chinese bank
 of the river.  However, the reports indicate that the Soviet
 proposal stopped short of endorsing the PRC claim that the riverine
 border should follow the main channel, with MLADA FRONTA asserting
 that Moscow's proposal said that "in disputed areas the frontier
 should lie along the rivers in those places where the rivers can be
 navigated, as usual in international practice."  Since there
 are stretches in the border rivers with more than one navigable
 channel, some islands--including the strategic isle opposite
 Khabarovsk--would still be in dispute.
 The reports accused the Chinese of publicizing their border stance
 at this time as part of an "operation of deceit" brought on by
 Peking's increasing international isolation as a result of its
 strident opposition to detei:tte and international relaxation.  They
 also pointed out Peking's inconsistency in not reporting the
 message to the Chinese domestic audience.  Most of the comment
 indicated that Peking should show its good intentions by responding
 positively to the tiarious Soviet offers over the border issue, but
 the C d radio on the 15th said that Soviet foreign ministry sources
 feel that "if Peking really honestly wished to improve relations" i,:
 should release the Soviet helicopter crew detained since their capture
 in China last March,

 USSR ON PRC      Despite official Soviet silence on the altered PRC
 PRECEDENT         stance, a 15 November Vasilyev commentary broadcast
 in Mandarin to  China  disclosed a past instance in
 which Peking had attempted to link its demand for withdrawal from
 disputed territories with Moscow's offer of a nonuse of force pact.
 Noting that Moscow on 15 January 1971 proposed a nonuse of force
 pact, Vasilyev added that Peking countered with an offer that the
 provisions be included in an agreement to maintain the status quo
 on the border.   "To cater to the Chinese side," Vasilyev said,
 "the Soviet side agreed to this suggestion and discussed the
 wording of corresponding provisions."  He alleged that progress
 in the talks had thus appeared likely, until the Chinese "suddenly
 asked the Soviet side to accept their concept about so-called
 'disputed areas,"' which he said amosnted to "putting forward a
 prerequisite unacceptable to any sovereign country in order to
 hamper settlement of the nonuse of force issue."

 TITO-HONECKER JOINT STATEMENT STRESSES EQUALITY, INDEPENDENCE
 Yugoslav  President Tito's 12-??15 November "official friendly" visit
 to the GDR was his first visit to East Germany since 1965, and the
 first meeting between the top leaders of the LCY and SED since
 June 1967, when Ulbricht spent a two-week "vacation" in Yugoslavia
 at Tito's invitation.   In hosting the Tito visit now, the East
 Germans have somewhat belatedly joined the series of meetings
 between Tito and Soviec bloc party leaders that followed Brezhnev's
 landmark visit to Belgrade in September 1971.   Only Bulgaria's
 Zhivkov--at odds with the Yugoslavs over the Macedonia issue--?had
 failed to meet with Tito since the Brezhnev visit.*  groin the
 Yugoslav standpoint, Tito's visit to the GDR served to further under-
 score Belgrade's nonalinement, coming in the wake of the Yugoslav
 leader's visit to the FRG in June.  It also served to project an
 image of recovered health and vigor for the aging LCY leader, who
 since his illness in February has successively visited Hungary,
 the FRG, Romania, Denmark, and now the GDR.
 The joint statement issued at the conclusion of Tito's visit
 underlined the concept of "equality" governing Yugoslav-GDR. state
 and party relations, as well as relations among the parties of the
 world communist movement--such equality, of course, being a perennial
 Yugoslav concern.  In noting that cooperation between Yugoslavia
 and the GDR had been "successfully developing" in recent years, the
 statement declared that this cooperation was based on "respecting
 the specific features of their internal development ano the specific
 features of the two countries' international positions."  The
 significance of the GDR's recognition of Yugoslavia's independent
 course was stressed on the eve of Tito's visit by Zagreb radio
 commentator Sund:ic, who added that while such recognition "does
 not mean that Yugoslavia's position is also always supported; this
 still represents progress considering some ea_lier views on the
 Yugoslav path to socialism."
 The tenuous state of Belgrade's support for the conference of
 European communist parties, planned for next year, was reflected
 in the absence of any reference in the joint statement to the

 planned conference or to the "consultarive meeting" of European
 CP's last month in Warsaw, which both the LCY and SED had attended.
 The omission is the more noteworthy in view of the broad support
 voiced at the Warsaw meeting for convening the European CP conclave
 soon of te:., the conclusion of the European security conference--a
 conference strongly supported in the present document.   On the
 score of economic cooperation, the joint statement followed the
 practice of past joint documents involving the Yugoslavs in omitting
 any reference to CEMA, despite Pt1grade's ten-year-long "participa-
 tion" in the activities of the Soviet bloc economic organization.
 TASS late on the 15th reported the Tito-Honecker statement as
 highlighting the contribution of "socialist, nonalined and other
 countries," and "all democratic and progressive forces" to the
 reduction of international tensions and the promotion of "equal"
 international cooperation.
 The statement's qualified reference to "agreement or similarity of
 views" on major international issues was reflected in the public
 statements by Tito and Honeclcer during the visit.  Thus, Tito, in
 an interview on East German TV on the 15th, said he and Honeclcer
 had reached "joint or approaching standpoints" in their talks.   The
 SED leader, in hi.s dinner toast on. the 12th, similarly noted only
 "a high degree of correspondence" of views on international develop-
 ments.                   In his toasts both on the 12th and 14th Honecker reminded
 his guest of the GDR's firm identification with the Soviet bloc,
 stressing in the latter speech that the GDR was "in an unshakable
 alliance with the main force of socialism--the Soviet Union--and
 firmly integrated in the community of socialist states."
 In his toast on the 12th, Tito included what could be construed as
 a veiled reference to Soviet pressures as exemplified in the
 Comintormist affair.   In noting the progress in relaxation of
 tensions "particularly" in Europe, he added that "a great number
 of countries, particularly nonalined ones, are subject to various
 pressures and crude attacks on their freedom and independence."

 LE DUC THO VWP DELEGATION LEAVES FOR PARIS TO VISIT FRENCH CP
 Hanoi reported on 19 November that a Vietnam Workers Party delegation
 headed by Le Duc Tho and Xuan Thuy had left for a visit in Paris
 at the invitation of the French Communist Party.   The ostensible
 purpose of the visit is to reciprocate the 10-1.7 November 1973
 visit to the DRV by a French CP delegation headed by Secretary
 General Georges Marchais.
 Despite speculation by APP  that the visit might lead to a meeting
 of the DRV officials with Secretary Kissinger, the brief, identical
 Hanoi radio and VNA accounts place the visit in a purely party
 context, list-ing delegation head Tho and deputy head Thuy only by
 their party titles, as member of the VWP Central Committee
 Politburo and Central Committee Secretary, respectively.   Both Le Duc
 Tho and Xuan Thuy figured prominently in the French CP delegation's
 1973 DRV visit, with Xuan Thuy accompanying the French on their
 visits outside Hanoi, as would be expected of the head of the VWP
 Central Committee external relations board.  Both he and Le Duc Tho
 also participated in discussions with the French delegation that
 were led by First Secretary Le Duan.  The VWP visit invitation had
 been noted in the 19 November 1973 communique on the French party
 delegation's visit, which said that Le Duari had accepted Marchais'
 invitation on behalf of the French CP.
 The only other members of the VWP delegation bound for France announced
 by Hanoi media were Tran Quang Huy, alternate member of the Central
 Committee, and NHAN DAN deputy chief editor Nguyen Thanh Le.  Western
 agencies reported the delegation consisted of 10 members.  Hanoi media
 named only two of the DRV leaders at the airport to say farewell to the
 Tho delegation--Politburo member Le Thaiih Nghi (who also is DRV foreign
 minister), and VWP Central Committee Secretary Nguyen Van Tran.

 Hanoi said farewell to Duc.   No special DRV delegation was reported to
 have attended the 1973, nondecennial observances in Tirana, but the

 PEKING STRESSES THAT ARMY MUST SUBMIT TO PARTY AUTHORITY
 A 13 November PEOPLE'S DAILY article indicating that some military
 leaders still resist party leadership has warned that "there has
 never been any change in the position of the absolute leadership
 of the party over the army, and no such change will be permitted."
 The article, entitled "The Gun Must Forever Be Kept in the Hands
 of the Party and the People," stated that army units must obey
 civilian party organs at all levels, and that within the PLA the
 party committee must exercise collective leadership.
 The article seemed to be aimed especially at military commanders,
 poini:edly noting that commanders must share responsibilities
 "under the collective leadership of the party committee."  The
 article argued that "only by exercising collective leadership
 can we expose in time the antiparty features of certain individual
 careerists" and "smash their criminal acts in.. setting up sects
 and forming factions for selfish ends."  Lin Piao was the ostensible
 target of the piece, which attacked his attempt to wrest "direct
 command" of the PLA from Mao and the party and his effort to
 assert the principle of individual authority, "ousting the
 political commissars."
 While using unusually frank language to focus public attention on
 Lin's attempt to usurp the military authority of the party, the
 article was careful to reaffirm the party loyalty of the PLA as
 a whole.  The article noted that Mao's principles on army building
 have "struck deep roots" among fighters a;id commanders throughout
 the country and could "by Rio means be sabotaged" by any conspirator.
 It also praised the army's contributions to the cultural revolution
 "under the leadership of the party," ascribing to Lin alone attempts
 during that period to control the party with the gun.  The recent
 anti-Lii. campaign was credited with miking the army "even more
 united."
 PROVINCIAL      The'need to improve party-army relations has been a
 REPORTS         standard theme in the campaign against Lin, and
 several provincial radios recently have claimed that
 progress has been made in strengthening the party's authority over
 the army.  1-luhehot radio on 19 November, for example, reported or
 a provincial PLA meeting for exchanging experiences in studying Mao's
 works on military affairs and in criticizing Lin's military line.

 Local border defense units were lauded for successfully criticizing
 Liii's crime of "undermining the unity between the army and the
 government" and for improving "the quality of their military and
 political work."  The report claimed that commanders and fighters
 of border defense units now "consciously submit themselves to the
 centralized leadership of local party commit;-~e_."  Nanchang radio
 on 14 November hailed a local PLA. unit for correctly und_'rstanding
 that the army is subordinate tc the party.  The broadcast denounced
 Lin for failing to ask higher 1,.vel party authorities for prior
 instruction and for failing to submit reports after actions had
 been taken.  And a 9 November Hofei report on a provincial, meeting
 on militia work praised local party committees for carrying forward
 "the glorious tradition of the party taking care of the armed forces"
 by strengthening their leadership over militia work.

 USSR
 IDEOLOGY SECRETARY DEMICHEV DENOTED TO CULTURE MINISTER
 In a demotion apparently reflecting the ascendancy of the
 conservatives in the current ideological crackdown, TASS on
 14 November announced the appointment of P.N. Demichev, Central
 Committee Secretary in charge of ideology, to the post of
 minister of culture, vacant since the death of Ye. A. Furtseva
 in late October.  This is a clear step down for Demichev, since
 Soviet practice requires that he now give up his secretariat
 position.  Although Demichev may be permitted to retain his
 rank as Politburo candidate member (other ministers such as
 Polyanskiy, Gromyko and Grechko hold Politburo membership),
 he will lose his party position as top administrator of the
 Soviet ideological system, becoming the first victim of the
 ideological crackdown.
 Demichev's demotion in the midst of the current crackdown
 suggests that he was regarded as too soft or as responsible
 for the shortcomings being criticized.  111s ouster may open
 the door for the appointment of a more hardline ideological
 supervisor.  Although Demichev has helped direct the repressive
 Soviet cultural policy over the past nine years, hic infrequent
 statements on ideology have not been as strident or extreme
 as those of many other ideological leaders.  He has been caught
 between his conservative superiors, Brezhnev and Suslov, and
 his influential hardline subordinates, Brezhnev protege S.P.
 Trapeznikov, head of the Central Committee's science and
 educational institutions section, and Mazurov protege V.F.
 Shauro, head of the Central Committee's culture section, who
 have advocated more repression.
 Demichev has labored under the additional disadvantage of not
 being a clear Brezhnev protege, and his demotion fits in with
 the recent undercutting of other idependent figures.  Conservative
 Belorussian and Moscow leaders had been charged with failing to
 keep their own bailiwicks ideologically pure  in recent Central
 Committee decrees which initiated the crackdown.*

 Demichev' F replacement as        ideology ser.retary will probably be
 named at a Central Committee plenum in mid-December.  A Supreme
 Soviet session is to open on 18 December, and such December
 sessions on the annual plan and budget are customarily preceded
 by a Central Committee plenum.
 AGRICULTURE MINISTRY RESISTANCE TO LINKS APPEARS TO CONTINUE
 The long-standing controversy over the link system of agricultural
 organization has been revived in recent Soviet press articles
 arguing that the system is incompatible with the national goal
 of increased specialization and mechanization of agriculture.
 This renewed criticism comes at a time when opposition to the
 system by the Ministry of.  Agriculture had seemed to have been
 overcome and the links solidly established as an accepted form
 of farm organization.    Circumstantial evidence suggests that
 the Ministry of Agriculture itself, or elements within it, is
 encouraging the new criticism.
 One critical article, written by Penza Ohkom Secretary V. Ogarev
 in the 26 August 1974 SOVIET RUSSIA, argued that while all-purpose
 brigades and mechanized links had looked very promising several years
 ago, they were losing their importance now with the trend toward
 specialization.  Although the author has not previously played an
 important role in the controversy, the chief editor of SOVIET
 RUSSIA, P.F. Alekseyev, had a clear record of opposition to links
 while chief editor'of RURAL LIFE in the late 1960's.  He declared
 in the Lay 1969 ZHURNALIST that links tended to disrupt the work
 of brigades, hindered correct use of equipment, and furthermore,
 that it was incorrect to recommend one form of labor organization
 for all farms.
 The most detailed current attack on links appeared in the October 1974
 issue of the ministry's organ ECONOMICS OF AGRICULTURE.  Entitled
 "From Links to Mechanized Units," the article by Bryansk Agricultural
 Equipment Association chief A. Illarionov argued that all-purpose
 brigades and mechanized links did not use equipment efficiently
 and should be replaced with specialized tractor brigades and
 mechanized units bigger than links.  He wrote that his oblast
 already had 1,500 mechanized links which, while they have advantages,
 also have important drawbacks.  Since links are assigned responsi-
 bility for certain fields,  the output of which determines their
 income, they lack interest in the farm's other fields and resist
 being called upon to work other fields.   Since the links' fields

 are zoo small to keep their equipment busy all the time, and
 since they resist having their equipment taken away for use on
 other fields, equipment is underused and the farm is unable to
 maneuver its resources with maximum efficiency.   Illarionov
 argued that bigger mechanized "units" (otryady), first introduced
 in his oblast in 1965, are needed to overcome the links' overly
 narrow attitude and to give the farm more control.  He explained
 that these "units" work areas of 1,200-1,500 hectares, while
 links in his oblast usually work under 50-100 hectares.
 Although he claimed such units had the same advantages as links--long-
 term responsibility for specific sections of land and pay based on
 the final result--it seems unlikely that the much larger units could
 avoid the loss of personal responsibility and initiative involved
 in assigning daily work and maneuvering people about characteristic
 of traditional brigades.  One of the main and most controversial
 features of unregulated mechanized links is their similarity to
 private farming--they are very small groups (often only two or three
 tractor drivers) with their own equipment, long-term responsibility
 for their own section of land, freedom to organize their own work,
 and with pay based on their ability to use that land and equipment
 most productively.
 In recent years links have become wir  spread, and articles criticizing
 them are rare.  Even the Agriculture Ministry's resistance had
 appeared broken in 1973.  Polyanskiy, whose silence on links had
 suggested lack of enthusiasm, had been demoted in early 1973 from
 First Deputy Premier in charge of agriculture to agriculture
 minister.   In June 1973 a.PRAVDA article attacked the Agriculture
 Ministry for delay in issuing recommendations on links.   The
 10 June article complained that V. Zhurikov, chief of the ministry's
 administration for organization, norms and wages, had conceded
 only to prepare a draft of recommendations by the end of 1973,
 whereas the recommendations should have been issued at the beginning
 of 1971, the article stated.  PRAVDA on 15 August 1973 reported a
 reply by Deputy Agriculture Minister A.P. Chubarov, agreeing
 with the article's criticisms of Zhurikov's administration and
 stating that recommendations had now been finished and would soon
 be issued.
 Nevertheless, no recommendations have yet appeared, and Zhurikov
 cautiously reaffirmed his doubts about the links in a December 1973
 article in the ministry journal ECONOMICS OF AGRICULTURE.  Although
 praising the incentive-oriented mechanized links as efficient, he
 pointed out that they do only part of the work, while the rest is
 done by brigade workers not working on an incentive basis, thus causing
 difficulties.    Further, he reasserted that a single form of organiza-
 tion cannot be recommended for everyone and must not be forced on farms.

 NOTES
 FORD VISIT TO JAPAN:  The Japan Communist Party (JCP) greeted
 President Ford's 18 November Tokyo arrival with a statement and
 an  AKAHATA editorial protesting the visit, claiming it was in-
 tended to open the way for overt introduction of U.S. nuclear
 weapons into Japan and to aid the beleaguered Tanaka government.
 The editorial made an "urgent appeal" for the mobilization of
 forces to "resolutely oppose" the visit.  Nevertheless, the JCP
 has been careful to publicly disassociate itself from "Trotskyite"
 groups the party claims are plotting violent activities.   Soviet
 media coverage of the President's Japan visit thus far has been
 limited to reports highlighting strains in U.S.-Japanese relations.
 On 17 November, before the President's arrival in Tokyo, TASS
 carried a dispatch by PRAVDA's Tokyo correspondent noting general
 "economic and political contradictions" between the two countries,
 as well as specific policies opposed by forces in Japan struggling
 against Japan's rearmament and its participation in "U.S. military
 blocs."  Monitored Soviet media have not acknowledged that there
 were demonstrations against the visit; in fact, on 17 November
 TASS reported a Tokyo "workers" rally protesting economic condi-
 tions but failed to note anti-U.S. speeches and slogans.  Peking
 media have not yet mentioned the President's visit.  Vietnamese
 communist media thus far have characterized the President's
 visit as an effort to prop up the "extremely reactionary impe-
 rialist alliai.re" still dominated by the "Nixon doctrine" in
 the face of widespread opposition among Japanese and South Koreans.
 Several commentaries by Hanoi and Liberation radios and NHAN DAN
 articles stress the large protest demonstrations in Japan, adding
 that Prime Ministec Tanaka is expected to resign after the visit.
 Thus far both Hanoi and Liberation media have generally treated the
 Presidential visit as though it were confined to Japan and Korea,
 although Liberation Radio once noted that Ford would visit "a
 number of countries," including those two, without mentioning
 the planned Vladivostok meeting wi;h Brezhnev.

 VLADIVOSTOK SUMMIT:  Soviet advance publicity for the forthcoming
 summit at Vladivostok has been low-level but constant since the
 plans for the meeting were first announced at the conclusion of
 Secretary Kissinger's visit to Moscow on 27 October.   The media
 have provided reports of President Ford's and Secretary Kissinger's
 press conference remar'hs on the meeting, roundups of J.S. press
 comment, reports of cit-'.zens' reactions in Vladivostok, and so
 on.  The tone of the reportage and comment has been upbeat,
 althoug'. there have been occasional references to the opponents
 of detente in the West.  Except for predictions that the meeting
 will contribute to further progress on strategic arms limitation
 issues, there has been little attempt to define the substantive
 purpose of the meeting beyond vague generalities about detente.
 ABORTIVE COUP IN BOLIVIA:   Moscow, in commenting on the 7 Novem'3er
 unsuccessful coup in. Bolivia and subsequent events, has accused
 "extreme right elements" within the armed forces of provoking t'
 coup in order to justify the cancellation of elections schedu:
 for 1975.   In the days '..-mediately following the abortive coup, it
 was given scant coverage:, possibly because Moscow media equated as
 "rightwing" boti; the government and the coup leaders--the latter
 being disaffectee' members of the cabinet and the Bolivian Socialist
 Falange, which foxr.sed part of the civilian coalition supporting
 President Hugo Baazer's government.   Howe\Ter, Soviet media reacted
 str )ugly to the 1.0 November La Paz ani.cuncement that a "new" military
 government, retaining Banzer as president, would remain in power until
 1980, with political and labor activities suspended indefinitely.
 TASS commentator Peter Tamarin said on the 18th that the post-coup
 measures amounted to a "legalization of military dictatorship" and
 reported that a "stormy protest" had been set off in the country--an
 apparent reference to student unrest.  Moscov radio commentator
 Leonid Levchenko asserted that sectors-of the military had planned
 the revolt in order to justify their "repressive measures" and
 predicted that the government would have to face the "determf.ned
 resistance of the Bol ;'an people."  Havana, which has shown decreased
 interest in the government of Bolivia since the overthrow of the
 leftist Torres regime by Banzer forces in 1971, has not commented
 on recent events in Bolivia, and PRENSA LATINA did not distribute
 a 12 November report submitted by its Lima office on a Bolivian
 official's denial that the coup 'as staged.
