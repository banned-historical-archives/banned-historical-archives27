 AMERICAN-ASIAN EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGE, INCORPORATED
 17 PARK AVENUE  ?  NEW YORK 16. N. Y.
 May 7, 1958
 Dr. Stanley K. Hornbeck, former U.S. Special Assistant
 Secretary of State and outstanding American authority on China,
 has written a brief but definitive article on "Communism At Work
 In'China."  The American-Asian Educational Exchange, Inc. is proud
 to begin its work with the publication of this article in pamphlet
 form and is happy to enclose a copy for your information.  We hope
 that the pamphlet will be translated into Japanese, Korean, Viet-
 namese, Chinese, Burmese and the other languages of Asia.
 My associates and myself have undertaken the difficult
 task of creating an organization to promote and foster the ex-
 change and circulation of educational and informational material
 between our country and Asia as it relates to our common struggle
 for freedom against totalitarian oppression.  The American-Asian
 Educational Exchange was organized to accomplish this purpose and
 to foster mutual understanding between the American and Asian
 peoples based on knowledge of approaches toward achieving our
 common aspiration - individual freedom and dignity which is
 threatened by communist tyranny in Asia and throughout the world.
 The communists have made effective use of the circulation
 of scholarly material in Asia on questions concerning the polit-
 ical and economic future of the independent nations of that
 continent.  The Free World has not begun to match this output,
 either in quantity or quality.  We hope that it will be possible
 for the American-Asian Educational Exchange to help fill this
 vacuum, not only in terms of circulating material in Asia but
 also in bringing the point of view of Asians to our people.
 The future extent of our program will be completely
 dependent on the financing we are able to secure and on the
 cooperation of such individuals as yourself.  We will keep you
 informed of our progress and look forward to receiving any sug-
 gestions or advice you may have.  With all best wishes,
 Walter H. Ju
 Vice-Chairman
 P S.  We have a limited quantity of "Communism At Work In China"
 which we will be happy to make available at your request.

 INTRODUCTION
 by
 STANLEY K. HORNBECK
 The American-Asian Educational Exchange, Incorporated is proud
 to formally begin its work with the publication of "Communism At
 Work In China" by Hon. Stanley K. Hornbeck, outstanding American
 diplomat and scholar.
 The American-Asian Educational Exchange was organized to fill
 the serious vacuum which exists in the exchange of information and
 literature between the United States and the independent nations of
 Asia insofar as they refer to our common struggle for freedom against
 totalitarian oppression. To be sure, there are other distinguished and
 worthy organizations in the United States and in Asia who work to-
 gether to achieve mutual understanding and friendship. Most of this
 work, however, is concerned with either philanthropic endeavors or
 cultural exchanges. There is little being done in the area which directly
 affects us all - the advances made by communist aggression and totali.
 tarianism and the efforts made to counter these advances.
 The specter of communism is ever present in Asia and to ignore
 this is to defeat any possibility of promoting general understanding
 between the peoples of the United States and Asia. The American-
 Asian Educational Exchange, Inc. hopes to bring our peoples closer
 together through the publication, translation and exchange of material
 in this country and in Asia so as to forge a bond which will have the
 strength to block and defeat the forces of tyranny which threaten our
 very existence.
 The officers and Advisory Board Members of the American-Asian
 Educational Exchange, Inc. consist of distinguished Americans with a
 knowledge of Asia who respect and sympathize with the aspirations
 of the peoples of that continent. An example of this type of representa-
 tion is Dr. Stanley K. Hornbeck, the author of this pamphlet. Dr.
 Hornbeck spent years in the Far East as a teacher. In addition to lec-
 turing and writing, he served as Chief of the Division of Far Eastern
 Affairs of the United States State Department from 1928-37 and as
 Special Assistant Secretary of State in 1944.
 Too many people believe, and many too many are told, that what
 has happened to and in China since VJ Day has been and is acceptable
 to the Chinese people because it is in keeping with their history and
 their traditions.
 As a matter of simple fact, the Chinese are a people who, when
 "Communism" descended upon them, had no history, no tradition
 and no living experience of anything comparable to or resembling the
 totalitarian system which the Communist Party in China and the
 government which that Party created have imposed upon them.
 The Communist Party in China had grown from seeds imported
 from Moscow in 1920. It had attempted in 1927 to seize control of
 the Nationalist movement. Thwarted in that effort, it thereafter had
 operated for twenty years as an armed and militant opposition. Finally,
 after VJ Day, with-Soviet moral and physical support, it defeated the
 National Government in battle after battle. In 1949 it set up in Peking
 (Peiping) a new government, the "Central People's Government of
 the People's Republic of China."
 The Promise Of Utopia
 China was at that moment a land that had been ravaged by war-
 fare during most of more than 20 years. Its economy was in ruins.
 Its government was overburdened and weary. Most of its people and
 most of its foreign residents and their affiliates were ready to welcome
 anything in the guise or the form of a "new deal." And that was what
 the Communists-blaming for the ills that prevailed, first the Nation.
 alists, second the Japanese, and finally all of the foreign powers except
 the Soviet Union and its satellites-promised: a new deal, a great new
 deal, a Utopia.
 What then was Communism? Well, whatever may have been the
 concepts and intentions of the founders, Communism had become by
 1949 a device for despotism, a system powered by and radiating an
 ideology, an instrument employed and adapted, in each of many
 countries, by a few leaders and a small percentage of the local popu-
 lation-for acquisition and exercise of political control. Incidentally,
 Yalta had contributed to its having become that.
 The first conspicuous and unmistakable result of the Communist
 victory in China was the retreat of the National Government to the
 island province, Taiwan (Formosa), and the beginning of the new

 phase in which, although China, the country, remains China there are
 in China two governments each exercizing authority over a part of.
 the country and each claiming to be the government of the whole.
 The Imposition Of Totalitarianism
 The government on the mainland, i.e. the Communist regime, has
 since 1949 made effective its jurisdiction over all parts-except only
 Outer Mongolia and Formosa-of what had been in the days of the
 Manchus the Chinese Empire; and it has given this domain the first
 truly totalitarian organization and administration that the peoples
 within its boundaries ever have known.
 In the course of eight years plus, it has made of its domain a Land
 wherein the central authorities make decisions which, implemented
 by a huge bureaucracy, directly affect almost every aspect of the life
 and livelihood of the people-men, women and children, individually
 and collectively. With an elaborate system of physical and psycho-
 logical controls, the Party and the Government exalt the "state",
 preach "Communism", tolerate no opposition or dissent, and prepare
 the nation for what they call a "Socialist" order.
 At the outset-while establishing order, the new rulers for some
 time showed respect for principles and procedures of justice. But once
 they were well in control they caused all agencies, including the courts,
 to function as instruments of state policy.
 Peiping Wars On Chinese People
 To cause the nation to accept an authoritarian and totalitarian
 regime, the Party and the Government set out to impose their own
 version of the Soviet version of "Communism." So they have made
 war-hot and cold-upon the old culture and its manifestations. In
 that process, they have done their utmost to extirpate all religions and
 all creeds-except the creed which they themselves preach. They have
 persecuted priests and teachers. They have expelled or imprisoned
 missionaries and foreign business men. They have forced the closing
 of foreign diplomatic and related establishments. They have burned
 and censored books. They have liquidated millions of their own
 people. They have enslaved many other millions. And, right and left
 and up and down, they have confiscated the properties of their victims.
 Early and conspicuous was their carrying out of "agrarian reform."
 First, landlords were denounced. Next they were turned over to the
 populace for trial and execution. Then their lands were divided among
 the peasants. Next the peasants were taxed, and they soon found the
 taxes more of a burden than had been the rentals which they had paid
 before-whereas from the paying of the taxes there was and is no way
 of escape. In that context, and in others, the regime has demonstrated
 -strikingly that power to tax can indeed be power to destroy.
 While destroying, the new rulers have also created. One of their
 first constructive achievements was that of establishing a stable cur-
 rency. Early, too, was their enactment of a new Marriage Law-which
 greatly improved the legal status of women but was very damaging,
 as it was intended to be, to the old social order.
 Emphasis On Communist "Education"
 They have emphasized education-Communist education. Schools,
 faculties, students, text books and their authors and their publishers-
 all-they have brought under government control. They have made
 Russian a second language. They employ Russians-some-as instruc-
 tors in many of the universities. They feature, as do the Russians,
 technical studies.
 In place of the old books, they have published and distributed
 more newly printed matter-officially approved, of course-than had
 ever before been circulated in China. Toward teaching, informing
 and propagandizing all, and for the illiterate in particular, official
 agencies turn out radio material, place loudspeakers on the streets,
 and distribute vast quantities of pictorial material-extending those
 services even to the villages. They have studied-as had their predeces-
 sors-various plans and proposals for either simplifying the Chinese
 language or romanizing it or both; but they have not thus far put
 into effect any of these.
 Of "Art", Chairman Mao Tse-tung has declared: "There is no such
 thing as art for art's sake; all work should serve the interests of the
 workers, peasants and soldiers." So-Art, in all its forms, is made to
 conform to official concepts and to serve the purposes of the State.
 In that framework, authors and artists glorify the laboring man, feature
 the Communist struggle for peace, and with one accord anathematize
 the United States.
 The Abasement Of The Intellectuals
 In all the fields they have endeavored to eliminate Western in-
 fluence, except that of the Soviet Union. They have made the experi-
 ence, the practices, the theories and the products of the Soviet Union
 their patterns and guides. They have emphasized conformity. They
 have engineered "anti" campaigns and "remodelling" movements, with
 processes of mob trial, of self criticism and of confession. They have
 used everywhere the procedures of spying, informing, accusing, con-
 demning and penalizing. They have compelled the people-especially
 4    Approved For Release 2002/05/07 : CIA-RDP80BO1676R003800100018 3
 pproved For Release 2002/05/07 : CIA-RDP80BO1676R003800100018-3
 the intellectuals-to abase themselves and to denounce one another.
 And these things they continue to do.
 They staged in 1957 a "Rectification Campaign", directed toward
 liquidation or suppression of critics of the regime. Mao Tse-tung had
 in February expressed himself in terms of a classic: "Let the hundred
 flowers bloom." The government had later invited criticism. There
 had ensued a month in which many intellectuals and many student
 groups indulged fervently in freedom of speech. And then the regime
 clamped down, in terms of "weeding the garden" or "suppression of
 rightists." Sad has been the fate, the brainwashing and orthodoxing,
 of many of the men-and some women-who in this context had ex-
 pressed themselves in words disagreeable to the regime.
 Deportation Called "Relocation"
 The very latest manifestation of the regime's will to dictate is
 being afforded in the so-called "relocation movement." Announce-
 ment was made last November that several hundred thousand students
 and likewise large numbers of government employees, urban workers,
 professional men and intellectuals were "volunteering" to go forth,
 settle in rural areas, and serve the cause of agriculture. "Volunteer-
 ing" was, of course, a euphonious rendering of "being sent"-just as
 it had been in relation to the soldiers sent by Peking into Korea in
 and after 1950.
 Thus has Communism, authoritarian totalitarianism, dealt with
 the people in mainland China. A few Communist leaders and some
 millions of Communist Party members, a "People's Government",
 dispose as they see fit of the lives and property of 500,000,000 people,
 their subjects.
 Among their purposes, the Communist leaders have of course had
 that of making China prosperous and powerful.
 In the economic field, on the constructive side, they have pro-
 ceeded with a program modeled upon that devised and already far
 advanced in the Soviet Union. The objectives and methods have been:
 agricultural reorganization and improvement; industrial rehabilita-
 tion and expansion; enlargement and improvement of communica-
 tions; exploitation of mineral resources; and collectivization.
 Soviet Five Year Plan For China
 Toward implementing its program the regime launched in 1953
 a Five Year Plan. That Plan is understood to have been prepared by
 Soviet experts. It called among other things for doubling the gross
 industrial output. Its techniques have been Soviet in concept and in
 form. T.he means for proceeding with it-including financing, equip-
 ment and instruction-have come largely from the Soviet Union.
 Remainders from it are now being carried forward in a second Five
 Year Plan.
 In what it has done with the programs thus far, the regime has
 greatly improved the physical face of the country. It has emphasized the
 interests of the state rather than the betterment of the lot of its people.
 Incidentally, yet pertinently, it has employed on projects directed
 toward agricultural improvement millions of men, women and children
 recruited in large part from the peasantry, and more millions from
 the slave labor concentrations. In the realms of industrial expansion,
 of improvement of communications, and of exploitation of mineral
 wealth, it has added substantially to the state's capabilities.
 The most venturesome of the politico-economic undertakings has
 been and is that of the agricultural collectivization. This has called
 for organizing of cooperatives within the Chinese farming pattern and
 for creation of large mechanized farms in areas where that is practic-
 able. It has been implemented widely and at a fast pace. It gives rise
 to, and it still leaves open a question: whether the regime can deal
 successfully with the human factor, can cause several hundred million
 peasants to cooperate in an undertaking which calls for abandonment
 of their traditional aspiration to land ownership and of their accus-
 tomed manner of tilling each his little plot of ground. To reconcile the
 peasants to this it will have to be shown them as individuals that they
 profit by it. Otherwise, each can offer resistance-at least in its pas-
 sive form.
 Chinese Resistance To Communism
 There has been from the outset some forceful resistance, in some
 places, to some of the regime's efforts. There is disagreement as to its
 character and extent. The Communists themselves have reported from
 time to time on "liquidation of subversive armed forces," in terms
 invariably of not less than "tens of thousands." Those reports signify
 only that there is some overt resistance and that where it occurs it is
 stamped out. That there can be much-in the absence of leaders, of
 organization and of weapons-is not likely. Mass suffering and popular
 resentment do not of themselves produce formidable revolt.
 There could develop a conflict within the Party. There could come
 disaffection within the armed forces. There might occur the long
 planned assault from Formosa. In the event of any one or more of such
 conceivable developments there might ensue a widespread popular
 6    Approved For Release 2002/05/07 : CIA-RDP80B01676R00380010001'-3
 Approved For Release 2002/05107 : CIA-RDP80BO1676R003800100018-3
 rebellion. There is, however, no indication that any of these; is im-
 minently likely.
 The Problem Of Food
 Probably greatest among Communist China's internal problems is
 that of food for its already huge and fast increasing population. China
 has more land than is now under cultivation, but it also has too many
 people in and clinging to the most favorable areas, and the trend of
 population movement recently has been from the land to the cities
 rather than the reverse. The regime is working on that problem. It is,
 with engineering, selection of crops, etc., bringing hitherto unculti-
 vated or long neglected areas into production. It has destroyed many
 grave sites and cemeteries. The population, though, is increasing at
 a rate which outruns that of the processes of reclamation. The answer
 would be: slow down the birth rate and speed up the agriculture. Birth
 control, though, while much talked about, is not sweeping the country.
 In the realm of mineral resources, China is in terms of absolute
 amounts reasonably well endowed, but in terms of relative amounts
 and of advantageous juxtapositions is less well off than are several
 other countries. What she is known to have is enough to support an
 extensive but a not a "super" industrialization.
 The Fallacy Of China Trade
 In the realm of foreign trade, there has been and is in some quarters
 much wishful talking about the possibilities of China as a market.
 If one looks at figures of world trade, historical and actual, one finds
 that the China market never has amounted to really much. Nor is it
 likely to in the near future. China has not much to export, and, there-
 fore, not much with which to pay for imports. There may come a time
 when she will have the wherewithal-but that time is probably a long
 way off. Currently, what the Communist regime most wants from
 abroad is strategic goods; what it gives most of in return is raw
 materials and food stuffs; and most of what trading it does is with
 the Soviet Union and other Communist countries.
 Communist China's armed forces-ground and air-are the founda-
 tion and guarantors of the regime's authority. They add up to a large
 establishment. Organized on the Soviet model and with Soviet assis-
 tance, they draw heavily upon Russian sources for equipment.
 Outstanding is the abiding fact that the Communist regime in the
 Soviet Union has supplied the inspiration, the pattern, the guidance
 and much of the equipment and funds that have made possible first
 ? the existence, second the victory, and third the thus-far-successful post-
 victory functioning of (a) the Communist Party in China and (b) the
 regime which now is implementing that Party's purposes and plans.
 Sino-Russian Solidarity
 Whether Communist China now is a satellite or is a partner of the
 Soviet Union is a question of no very great importance. The two are
 allies. Communist China is in many respects dependent on the Soviet
 Union; the Soviet Union has in turn need of and uses for Communist
 China's assets; and the leaders in the two countries have in common
 several portentous objectives. For the present, those leaders cause the
 Bear and the Dragon to lie down together, lie abroad together, stand
 together, forage together, and profit together, in a climate of-for

 them-convenient and advantageous
 day-quarrel and go apart; but not now.
 Together, they are encouraging the Peking Government to essay
 a role in world affairs utterly unfamiliar in modern times to the Chi-
 nese state, that of an affirmative heavy-weight contender. In this, some
 features of the foreign policy, the strategy and the tactics of China's
 Communist leaders are obvious: Among these are: acceptance of
 Soviet leadership; support of positions taken internationally by the
 Soviet Government; effort to make secure the newly re-established
 Chinese imperial domain; effort to achieve for that domain a great
 power status, with universal diplomatic recognition of its Government
 and occupation by that government of China's seats in the United
 Nations; and, in general, effort to enlarge the influence of the Com-
 munist bloc.
 What plans the Peking authorities may have, if any, for forceful
 external adventuring they alone know. They are emphasing prepared-
 ness. They are expressing opinions and giving advice abroad-in sup-
 port of Soviet opinions, advice or action. They presumably will be
 guided by their and Moscow's reading of developments and opportuni-
 ties in the "cold" war. Meanwhile, they propagate at home and abroad
 the thought that China is again a great power, that it must "liberate"
 Formosa, and that it must and will defy the United States.
 Peiping Beset By Internal Problems
 However, it seems reasonable to believe that for the present the
 regime is fully preoccupied with its program and its problems at home.
 It is not true that "all is well along the Yangtze." It is not true that
 in mainland China's cities "there no longer are flies." It is not true that

 the people have enough to eat and enough to wear and are happy.
 Qualified observers note with one accord that the programmers and
 implementers are now encountering grim realities in terms of short-
 ages. One such who, having known the old China, has travelled ex-
 tensively in the new, remarks nostalgically that in the new-he hears
 no laughter and he seldom glimpses a smile. Reports currently (in
 February 1958) being made in Peking by officials of the regime show
 clearly that there has been and is widespread discontent.
 The regime is certainly in no position now to continue the pace at
 which it thus far has exploited the people and the land in the interests
 of the Party, the Government and the State. Nor are the mood of the
 people, the capabilities of the Land, and the relations between those
 who govern and those who are governed such as would warrant pursuit
 by Communist China of a foreign policy involving a risk of war with
 a power capable of bombing its industrial and military concentrations
 and blockading its ports. The regime can, however, and does make
 trouble for and among its neighbors and in the forum of world affairs.
 The victory of the Communist Party in China in 1949 and the juris-
 dictional dichotomy which ensued gave rise to many problems in the
 relations of other countries with China. All other Communist states
 and several non-Communist states promptly transferred their diplo-
 matic recognition from the National Government to the newly created
 Communist Government in Peking. As of today, the United States,
 and with it a majority of other countries, still abide by the recognition
 accorded over the years since - 1928 to the National Government.
 U. S. China Policy Unwavering
 On several occasions, once very recently (in January 1958), this
 country's Secretary of State, Mr. Dulles, has' declared that it is the
 policy of the United States in this context: to continue our recognition
 and support of the National Government; to continue our withholding
 of diplomatic recognition of the Communist "People's Government";
 and to continue our opposing of admission of the latter to the United
 Nations. (Mr. Dulles also has explained why, has shown that we do
 not ignore Communist China, and has added to the effect that "no"
 does not necessarily mean "never.")
 That policy takes appropriate account of the record and the atti-
 tude of the National Government and it shows respect for our obliga-
 tion and our commitment to that Government. It takes account like-
 wise of the record and the attitude of the Communist regime on the
 mainland. It is in line with the over-all purposes and efforts of Ameri-
 can foreign policy in defense and promotion of freedom, peace, security
 and justice.
 Communists United In Spreading System
 The Communist Government in Peking follows the lead of the
 Soviet Government in Moscow in the war which the Communist world
 is making upon the free world. They too work hand in hand toward
 victory for "Communism"' throughout the world. They make use of a
 great variety of weapons and, with many methods, press their attack
 on many fronts. They demand concessions but they make no conces-
 sions. They talk of "peaceful co-existence"-but those words do not
 mean to them what they mean to us. Nor does "Communism" mean
 "communism": it is simply a name, the name of a system devised and
 employed toward enslavement and exploitation of the many by a few.
 The United States is the world's most powerful and most
 committed champion of freedom. In defense of freedom-our
 own and that of other peoples-it is simple common sense that
 we be prepared and be determined to use many weapons and many
 methods, both positive and negative. Surely we should not give
 militant Communism aid and comfort. Surely we should refrain
 from any action implying that we assent to its purposes and efforts
 to consolidate and extend its gains. Surely we should not accom-
 modate it at the expense of any of our allies. Surely we should
 make difficulties for it. Surely we must be prepared to counter
 with effective force if, when and wherever it resorts to use of force
 against any free people. And we must make clear to it and to all
 concerned that we can be relied upon.
