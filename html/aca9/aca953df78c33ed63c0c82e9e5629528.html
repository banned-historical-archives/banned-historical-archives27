HIGHLIGHTS 
The Schuman proposal for pooling steel and 
coal resources continued to hold the attention of 
Western Europe this week following the recpnt British 
Labor Party statement expressing doubts about the value 
of the plan for Britain. Although the statement will have 
little decisive effect on Western Europe's generally favor-
able attitude toward the plan, it has caused widespread 
disappointment and even annoyance and will complicate 
any future negotiations for British participation (see page 2). 
In the Far East, present French efforts to achieve a 
political settlement in Indochina hang in the balance in view 
of the possibility that Bao Dai's decision to visit France 
may develop into a "stay-awar strike to extract French 
concessions, as well as the likelihood that the 27 June inter-
state conference between French and Indochinese representa-
tives will contribute little toward an over-all solution of 
outstanding political differences (see page 10).

WESTERN EUROPE 
Schuman Plan Although the recent British Labor Party 
statement rejecting the Schuman Plan has 
caused widespread disappointment and even annoyance among 
West European nations, there is little indication that it will 
have any decisive effect upon the generally favorable attitude 
of those nations toward the plan, The British Labor statement 
may even temporarily stimulate French and German efforts 
toward continental unity. Some revival of anglophobia in 
Italy and France may take place. The Socialist parties of the 
several countries, for reasons of party solidarity, have gen-
erally avoided any outright condemnation of the British Labor 
Party, but it is doubtful that they will follow the British lead. 
Only the Luxembourg Socialists have reportedly registered 
full concurrence with the UK Labor Party's statement. 
Export Controls The attitudes of both Denmark and Sweden 
toward joint Western controls on exports 
to Eastern Europe are a major obstacle to the establishment 
of a common front on export controls. Denmark, while it has 
been participating in the Consultative Group, has from the 
beginning opposed the concept of controls and is now request-
ing a special reservation on tankers if their export is indis-
pensable to the conclusion of Danish trade agreements with 
the Soviet orbit. This request may lead to similar reservations 
by other countries. Sweden's adherence to neutrality and the 
importance it attaches to its trade with EaStern Europe render 
Swedish participation in combined Western control of strategic 
commodities extremely doubtful. Although Sweden has indicated 
that it would take unilateral action to reduce or prohibit its sub-
stantial exports of such vital ball and roller bearings as are 
placed on the 1-A list, the UK has opposed the inclusion of these 
items on the list because it feels that unless Sweden joins in 
multilateral controls, such controls would not prevent bearings 
from reaching the Soviet orbit.

UNITED KINGDOM 
Foreign Trade As the UK continues its crucial campaign 
to balance its foreign trade, last month's 
record-breaking daily export rate, coupled with an attendant 
sharp rise in dollar income, probably enabled the UK to 
achieve an over-all balance of payments for May. The 
value of imports, reflecting the rising prices of raw mate-
rials, reached an all-time high, and the UK's dollar deficit, 
though reduced, continues. Exports and re-exports totaled 
189 million pounds while imports exceeded 229 million, leav-
ing a deficit of 40 million pounds which was probably cancelled 
by invisible earnings. Meanwhile, the UK increased its exports 
to dollar areas, with Canada purchasing $10 million and the 
US $8 million more than in April. 
FRANCE 
Economic Trends The gradual transition of the French 
economy from scarcity in virtually 
all products to an actual surplus in many lines may create 
temporary inconsistencies in the French attitude toward im-
plementation of the ECA program. Marketing difficulties in 
many production lines have brought about a mild deflationary 
situation as contrasted to the pronounced inflationary pressure 
which had prevailed from the end of the war in 1945. The pro-
duction groups most directly affected are becoming concerned 
with the prospects for their immediate economic welfare. For 
example, large sectors of labor,fearing unemployment, are 
more suspicious of ECA -sponsored projects designed to increase 
industrial productivity. Agricultural producers hesitate to en-
large their plantings, as encouraged by ECA representatives, un-
til assured of stable foreign markets or a government subsidy to

make up losses. Contrary to ECA recommendations, the 
government has made some concessions to industrial pro-
ducers by: (1) tolerating some cartelization; (2) accelerating 
its program for restoring prewar tariff restrictions; and 
(3) agreeing to abandon some projected raises in taxes. 
Despite these concessions to domestic pressure groups, how-
ever, the French Government sympathizes with the broad 
objectives of the US for France and Western Europe and is 
quietly taking steps which may ultimately result in the adop-
tion of measures substantially in agreement with the ECA 
program. Thus, though winking at cartels, it has been slowly 
preparing the country for its first anti-trust legislation; while 
temporarily sacrificing adequate tax revenues, it has -pushed 
ahead with a comprehensive tax reform; and, though restoring 
some tariffs, it has been removing quota restrictions on trade, 
and has been working toward a resumption of multilateral 
payments.

L. increase of up to 30 percent over last 
year's military expenditures by carrying the military 
item in the 1950 budget at virtually the same number of 
rubles used in 1949. The 1950 planned revenue is about 
5 billion below 1949's actual revenue, expenditures ex-
ceed 1949 by about 20 million rubles, and expenditures 
for military purposes exceed 1949 by a relatively in-
fl 200 million rubles. The budget message, 
however, stresses the fact that the 1950 budget was made 
up with due consideration of the revalued ruble (appreci-
ated by 32.5 percent) and of the reduction in wholesale 
prices of heavy industry goods and freight rates as of 
fl  
resources to be devoted directly and indirectly to mill-
i January 1950. This means that the amount of physical 
tary purposes will be about 30 percent higher in 1950 than 
in 1949. Another place where increased military expendi-
Li tures may be concealed is under the capital construction 
item, which was raised by more than one-fourth for 1950.

NEAR EAST - AFRICA 
PALESTINE 
Peace Prospects Two recent developments pointedly under-
line the failure of the UN to achieve any 
progress toward a Palestine settlement: (1) the decision of 
the Trusteeship Council. (TC) to return the statute for inter-
nationalization of Jerusalem to the General Assembly; and 
(2) Egypt's recall of its representative to the UN Palestine 
Conciliation Commission (PCC). The TC decision was made 
because of recognition of the impractibability' of implementing 
the GA resolution. The action by the Egyptian Government is 
further indication that the Arab states, with the possible 
exception of Jordan, have no desire to negotiate a settlement 
with Israel at this time, and withdrawals of other Arab repre-
sentatives to the PCC may follow. Meanwhile, border incidents 
In the Hebron area south of Jerusalem are disturbing Israeli-
Jordan relations and delaying still further the reopening of 
peace negotiations between these two countries. 
EFtAN 
US-UK Differences Although several recent differences in 
US and UK policy in Iran will probably 
be ironed out, they play into the hands of both the USSR and 
hostile elements within Iran which are frying to convince 
public opinion that rivalry exists between the US and UK over 
Iran. The British have given a demonstration of jet planes in 
Tehran, presumably to encourage Iran to buy such planes, and 
have attempted to sell oil-burning steam locomotives to Iranian 
railways despite recommendations against such purchases by 
US advisers to the Iranian Army and the Seven Year Plan

Organization. In addition, the UK's opposition to further 
revision of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company concession 
agreement is contrary to the US view that the British 
should make some gesture, however small, in order to 
secure public support for Iranian ratification of the agree-
ment. British reluctance to convert certain Iranian 
sterling holdings into dollars for the servicing of an out-
standing dollar loan is also disturbing to US interest in 
encouraging development loans to Iran to further the Seven 
Year Plan for economic reconstruction. 
INDIA 
Nehru and Communism Prime Minister Nelut, during 
his recent visit to Indonesia, 
failed to justify fears that the emotional atress of the 
occasion might induce him to ignore the dangers of inter-
national Communism in Asia. Nehru appeared to recog-
nize clearly that Communist tactics of violence were 
dangerous in neighboring states as well as in India itself. 
There is still no real reason to believe that Nehru will 
now align his country firmly against Communism as such 
or cooperate more closely with the West. Presumably 
still committed to the concept of Asia as a third force, 
Nehru might instead balance any possible offensive 
against the tactics of international Communism with a 
parallel attack on the tactics of the West. Nehru's stand 
against the Communist Party of India has never been such 
as to preclude future cooperation if the Communists would 
abandon destructive tactics and work under his leadership 
for the advancement of common domestic objectives. 
Nevertheless, it is apparent that for the time being his 
power will be used against strong-arm tactics by the Com-
munists whether in India or elsewhere in Asia.

FAR EAST 
CHINA 
Communist Policy The Chinese Communists' latest 
major policy statement, a report 
delivered by Mao Tse-tung to the Central Committee of the 
Party on 6 June, reflects the Chinese Communists' confidence 
in the security of their position in the face of both serious 
economic problems and a recent growth of popular hostility 
to the regime. Although economic hardships have been the 
principal cause of popular discontent, Mao promised neither 
early Communist-achieved prosperity nor outside aid from 
any quarter. Instead, the report encouraged the more enter-
prising and productive elements of Chinese society, such as 
prosperous peasants and businessmen, by calling for changes 
favorable to their interests and by reaffirming the doctrine 
of "New Democracy," which claims that Chinese socialism is 
a distant, not an early, goal. 
Mao's statement indicates that the Communists are 
keenly aware of their administrative weaknesses, which have 
impeded the smooth implementation of the Communist "take-
over), program and have played no small role in the recent 
decline in the regime's popularity. There will probably not 
be a major Party purge, however, at this time. The screening 
of "careerist" elements within the party probably will not 
affect more than a small proportion of the present member-
ship; and continued recruiting is likely to restore the losses. 
Mao s speech indicated that although the estimated 400,000 
bandits still to be suppressed by the Communists are a nui-
sance of considerable magnitude in some areas, they offer no 
real threat to Communist control of the mainland. Mao referred 
to the "liberation" of Taiwan as "still a serious task," but did 
not commit the Communists to any deadline for its capture.

INDOCHINA 
Bao's Plans Emperor Bao Dal's decision to visit Paris 
may develop into a "stay-away" strike 
designed to induce the French to expand the "limited 
in-
dependence" granted Vietnam within the French Union. Bao 
Dai believes not only that the French are losing ground mili-
tarily and have abandoned all plans for a political solution of 
the Indochina dispute but that close French control of finances 
makes it impossible for any genuine Vietnamese Government 
to function or to develop popular support. The Emperor insists 
that the French are afraid to take any real steps toward re-
solving Indochinese problems, and feels that only trivial results 
can be expected from the forthcoming conference of delegates 
from the three Indochinese states and France. 
Deeply dissatisfied with the French, Bao Dai is probably 
deliberately exaggerating the extent of his discouragement in an 
effort to bring US pressure to bear on France. Nevertheless, 
his protracted absence from Vietnam at this time would severely 
weaken chances for the development of a stable non-Communist 
regime in Indochina. 
Conference Prospects The long-awaited interstate conference 
between Trench representatives and 
delegates of the three Indochinese states, which will begin at 
Pau in Southern France on 27 June, is not likely to contribute 
materially to a solution of the political problems in Indochina. 
The French will make every effort to restrict the agenda to a 
technical discussion of the extent of participation by the govern-
ments of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia in the administration of 
Indochina's currency, customs, immigration, and communications. 
The Indochinese representatives will have little success in using 
the conference to increase their national prerogatives in these

over Vietnam's customs revenue. In addition to slight 
prospects for major French concessions on the technical 
aspects of the conference, no far-reaching decisions are 
likely regarding over-all Franco-Vietnamese relations, 
in view of: (1) the apparent acceptance of the French plan 
for the conference by Vietnamese Premier Tran Van Huu; 
(2) the tentative appointment of Albert Sarraut?an elderly 
former Minister or Colonies--as head of the French delega-
tion; and (3) the failure to date of the French to assign to 
their delegation a representative of the French Foreign 
Ministry, which professes to advocate a more liberal Indo-
china policy than the status quo line taken by the Ministry 
of Overseas France.

en Tension Persists Tension stemming from the recent 
, unsuccessful Arequipa revolt continues 
r and further outbreaks of violence are possible. General Odria, 
b the sole presidential candidate, has been losing the little 
personal popularity he possessed; and many leaders both in

Li to postpone the elections scheduled for 2 July. Acting Junta 
President Noriega (who turned against President Bustamante 
1-1 in 1948 only a day after dramatic protestions of loyalty) may 
u well seize upon even minor disturbances to declare martial

BRAZILIAN ANTI -US SENTIMENT 
The growing anti-US sentiment in Brazil, which has 
become more marked in the press and among some high 
government officials and officers of the armed forces since 
the announcement of the US loan to Argentina and the publica-
tibi. of the Gillette'subcommittee'o eport On coffee prIces, may 
complicate the problem of nr flt.i.ining'the traditionally cbopera-
tive relations between the US and Brazil. Underlying this recently 
increased criticism of the US and its policies is the feeling of 
many Brazilians that the US is not granting them the special con-
sideration they feel is warranted by Brazil's record of cooperation 
in World Wars I and II and since 1945. Many high Brazilian officials, 
both civilian and military, are convinced that Brazil's contribution as 
an ally of the US in World War H was so much greater than that of 
any other Latin American country that the US should favor Brazil 
above all Other Latin American nations. These officials see the US 
loan to Argentina as a denial of Brazil's deserved preferential posi-
tion. Similarly, Brazilian military leaders do not appreciate the 
present US Soviet-containment policy in Europe under which European 
countries, including former enemies of both the US and Brazil, re-
ceive US military equipment free while Brazil must pay high prices 
for it. These circumstances provide ammunition for thorie who favor 
striving in every way to reduce Brazil's peculiar dependence on the 
US and may lead to Brazilian reluctance to continue to cooperate 
fully with the US. 
The Brazilians, for example, may become intransigent 
in their negotiations of a friendship, navigation, and commerce 
treaty with the US; or they may decide to continue "to study" 
US Steel's application to exploit the large manganese deposits 
in the State of Matto Grosso and thus delay the flow of manganese

ore to the US. The growing anti-US feeling may also 
stimulate the nationalistic attitude reflected in the "Brazil 
for the Brazilians" slogan which, along with the pressure 
of politicans seeking the votes of nationalists and Communists 
for the important October elections, may force passage of 
a bill now before Congress that could curtail the flow of 
critical and strategic minerals to the US. Brazil will probably 
also make every effort to support the present high price of 
coffee through subsidies to the producers and through including 
larger amounts of coffee in barter agreements with European 
nations.
