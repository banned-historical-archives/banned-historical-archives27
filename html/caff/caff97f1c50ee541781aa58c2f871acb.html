 As a number of us here in Congress
 have contended for years, when the chips
 are down the Polish Communists, the
 captors of the longsuffering Polish peo-
 ple, will be right in there pitching with
 the Soviet Communists. What better
 proof do we need that all the talk about
 winning the Polish Communists away
 from the Soviets is nothing but danger-
 ous daydreaming.
 It is time for the American people to
 demand  an explanation from  those
 unrealistic officials who have been push-

 the East European Communist leaders.

 Congress and in the Nation's news media
 about the proper role of the Federal
 Government in regulating the content
 of radio and television programs and

 vanced and sophisticated an aggregate of
 societies as those which compose the whole
 of western Europe. The gap between this
 country and Europe, if it really exists to any
 significant degree, is evidently only a tem-
 porary one and, in fact, probably does not
 exist in certain areas of technology at all. As
 worst, we may not expect Europe to fall sig-
 nificantly  and  permanently  behind  the
 United States. More serious, however, is the
 position of large areas of the non-European
 world where a gap between them and the
 more advanced countries appears to be open-
 ing rapidly, ominously, and possibly per-
 manently.
 When one ponders the implications of
 these present circumstances, one is likely to
 feel an inward uncertainty about the large
 and easy solutions so frequently offered for
 the problems of human poverty at home or
 abroad. It may be that not all men under all
 conditions can respond as a large part of our
 own society responded to the massive social
 investment of the post World War II period.
 It may even be that we will have to face up
 to some sort of permanent subsidy, both for-
 eign and domestic, for those who lack the
 skills or education to respond to larger op-
 portunity as our own population has re-
 sponded. At best, however, such a solution is
 only a palliative, for it does not erase the un-
 happiness and resentment which must arise
 among those who will still see a marked dif-
 ference between their own position in the
 social order and the position of those whose
 expertise of one kind or another enables
 them to enjoy greater amenities without be-
 ing subsidized. The great problem-and per-
 haps the great mystery-of our time is clear-
 ly delineated in this dilemma. No amount of
 expropriation, redistribution of wealth, or
 subsidization  will  resolve  it  alone.  Men
 must find a way to strike the sparks of inner
 motivation. If the task seems impossible, we
 may still find some measure of hope in the
 great postwar educational experiment of this
 society. rYi p   01
 AN API; EAL yr CONSCIENCE TO MR.
 KOSYGIN
 (Mr. MULTER (at the request of Mr.
 VANIK) was granted permission to extend
 his remarks at this point in the RECORD
 and to include extraneous matter.)
 Mr. MULTER. Mr. Speaker, ever since
 the defeat of the Arabs, and in effect,
 of the Soviet dream of dominating the
 Middle East, Russia has repeatedly ac-
 cused Israel of "aggression" and Hitler-
 ite atrocities and war crimes.
 It is unthinkable that Russia, which
 has dominated Eastern Europe  and
 which knowingly practices anti-Semit-
 ism, should accuse another people of be-
 ing inhumane, especially one which has
 known the destruction of one-third of
 its number by these "Hitlerite atrocities."
 I commend to the attention of our
 colleagues "An appeal of Conscience to
 Mr. Kosygin," by the Conference of
 Presidents of Major American Jewish
 Organizations. The conference asks the
 representative of the Soviet Union to
 concentrate on attaining a lasting peace
 in the Middle East, instead of making
 false accusations.
 The appeal follows:
 AN APPEAL OF CONSCIENCE TO MR. KosYGIN
 In statement after statement since the col-
 lapse of Russia's Arab allies in the Middle
 East, the Soviet Union has made repeated
 charges in the United Nations that Israel has
 committed  "Hitlerite  atrocities  and  war
 crimes."
 The Soviet representatives and their sup-
 porters have indulged in vilification and
 abuse to represent as Nazi aggression Israel's
 successful defense against an enemy which
 has sworn to destroy her in a "Holy War."
 The Soviet Government has sent insulting
 and threatening notes to the Government of
 Israel, a fellow member of the Uinted Na-
 tions, which it insists on describing as "the
 Tel Aviv authorities." The Soviet Govern-
 ment newspaper Izvestia has made the lying
 charge that Israeli troops have shot down
 women and children in public executions.
 This vicious and unscrupulous propaganda
 is a potentially explosive form of warfare.
 Under Soviet Incitement the Arabs initiated
 and lost the hot war for Soviet Influence In
 the Middle East. Now the USSR has taken
 upon itself the full responsibility for verbal
 aggression.  This  is  supported  by renewed
 arms shipments to the Arabs.
 This powerful country, the USSR, has
 never published a word of criticism about the
 Nazi war criminals who are actively mobilized
 in Cairo and Damascus in the war against the
 Jews. The Soviet Government has given un-
 stinting support to the Arab States which
 disseminate the crude anti-Semitism of the
 "Protocols of the Elders of Zion."
 The very country which is preventing the
 development of Jewish life within its own
 borders,  does  not hesitate  to  fasten  the
 hideous label of Nazism on the survivors of
 a small Jewish nation which lost a third of
 its members in Nazi atrocities.
 The accent of present Soviet propaganda
 is the accent of the Stalinist doctors' plot
 and the destruction of Soviet Jewish society.
 It is the accent of Soviet anti-Semitic propa-
 ganda against Judaism, of the fever of Jew-
 hatred  that periodically seizes the  Soviet
 press. It means that the incorrigible anti-
 Semites who infest Russian society are again
 being given their hour.
 It is not the first time in this century
 that a major power has accused Jews of sub-
 human crimes and threatened dire punish-
 ment for imaginary evils. The world knows
 the terrible price the Jewish people have
 paid for such monstrous accusations. The
 Soviet Union should think again before it
 follows the appalling example of the power
 whose pathological hatred of Jews was the
 beginning of a process that brought death
 and destruction to many nations.
 The undersigned, representing the Jewish
 community of the United States call upon
 the Soviet Union to put aside the delusion
 of quick and facile propaganda victories. Let
 it strive for a lasting peace in the Middle
 East, recognizing that Israel, like the Arab
 States, has every right to exist and prosper.
 The Soviet Union should consider carefully
 whether it indeed wishes to follow in the
 footsteps of those whose hatred of Jews led
 to the cataclysm of twenty-five years ago.

 CONGRESSMAN  LESTER WOLFPP'S
 REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL
 AIR SHOW
 (Mr. KARTH (at the request of Mr.
 VANIK) was granted permission to ex-
 tend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. KARTH. Mr. Speaker, as a charter
 member of the House Committee on Sci-
 ence and Astronautics, I have attempted
 over the years to keep myself and the
 Congress informed on what the United
 States and other countries are doing in
 research and the technological develop-
 ment in the broad field of aerospace re-
 search.
 As part of that effort, I have tried to
 attend meetings and functions where
 there was a possibility that I might en-
 hance this knowledge.
 Mr. Speaker, this year I was unable to
 attend the International Air Show re-
 cently held in Paris. As chairman of the
 Subcommittee on Space Science and Ap-
 plications, I did encourage our colleague,
 LESTER WOLFF, of New York, to attend
 if possible and make a report to me on
 what he saw and what he found. So
 often I have found this information to
 be of great value during subcommittee
 hearings.
 Since the value of these kinds of meet-
 ings is sometimes questioned by the news
 media, I feel it important that a sum-
 mary of these findings be printed in the
 RECORD for everyone to see.
 Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the
 gentleman from New York for having
 done an excellent job and submit for the
 RECORD a synopsis of that report, as fol-
 lows:
 CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES,
 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
 Washington, D.C., June 22, 1967.
 Hon. JOSEPH E. KARTH,
 Chairman, Subcommittee on Space Science
 and Applications, Committee on Science
 and Astronautics.
 DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN:  As you know I re-
 cently had the privilege of attending the In-
 ternational Air Show as a representative of
 the Committee on Science as Astronautics,
 Subcommittee on Space Science and Appli-
 cations.
 It is with pride that I can report on the
 trip. The United States exhibitions were ex-
 cellent. The  Congressional delegation had
 valuable and potentially profitable discus-
 sions with foreign officials and business ex-
 ecutives.
 Permit me to turn first to the American
 space and aviation exhibits. These displays,
 which showed a marked improvement over
 our displays during the 1965 International
 Air Show, were certainly the best of this
 year's show.  The  exhibits  by  the United
 States  Government  and -private  industry
 were far more impressive than the exhibits
 of all the other competitors including the
 Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
 While Russia  and other nations, were
 content to display hardware without 'giving
 it meaning or purpose, the United States
 exhibits diplayed much more. Yes, certainly
 our finest hardware was there. But with it
 were competent guides with complete dis-
 play explanations for the interested visitors.
 The hardware was brought to life; the nuts
 and bolts became the work of men to achieve
 ago-old dreams of men.
 An example of our excellence In this re-
 gard was the heavy and positive emphasis on
 our unmanned technical programs in space.
 These very important and difficult feats,

 which do not capture the headlines in the
 manner of manned flights, were brought
 into proper perspective. The high level of
 achievement we have had in our unmanned
 flights  and  the  invaluable  data  gathered
 were clearly and interestingly portrayed.
 In addition to our displays the United
 States provided the outstanding flying ex-
 hibitions of the show. The TFX flight was
 acknowledged by people from every country
 as a high point of the week. Our acrobatic
 teams also excelled-with-their demonstration
 of expertly executed disciplined flying.
 Another significant contribution by the
 United States to the Air Show was the first
 commercial  trans-Atlantic  flight  of  the
 Douglas DC-8--61, the enlarged passenger jet.
 The Congressional delegation was privileged
 to fly to Le Bourget on the Inaugural flight
 of this aircraft which created a sensation at.
 the Air Show. Every day we were there thou-
 sands queued up to view this new luxury
 aircraft. Compared to the mock-ups of the
 Concorde and the Russian commercial jet
 aircraft, the Douglas plane was the star of
 the show. The quality of this plane, com-
 bined with the fact that it is in actual serv-
 ice, give us reason to believe the United
 States can maintain the lead in the interna-
 tional race for major aircraft business. I am
 optimistic that this will prove highly bene-
 ficial, as it has in the past, in overcoming
 our balance of payments deficit.
 The Congressional delegation, Mr. Chair-
 man, besides viewing all the exhibits and
 representing our country at various official
 functions also met with foreign representa-
 tives of our  government and the private
 sector. We discussed with these Americans,
 who spend most of their time abroad, their
 problems in dealing with  foreign govern-
 ments. These meetings will provide us with
 valuable information in assisting in the work
 of these technical ambassadors-of-good-will.
 All of the points I have discussed thus far,
 Mr. Chairman, are quite important and re-
 quired our presence at the Air Show. But
 we were fortunate enough to add a very sig-
 nificant bit of diplomatic activity to "our
 trip.
 I had, early in our stay, the opportunity to
 arrange a meeting between some members of
 the French Chamber of Deputies and our
 delegation headed by Chairman Miller. After
 our- first meeting we were invited- to and
 visited the Chamber of Deputies where we
 had the invaluable opportunity to view the
 Chamber in session and meet many Deputies.
 We were able  to  exchange  opinions with
 these Deputies.                             -
 Onegoal of our discussions, Mr. Chairman,
 was to find out if there is a basis for a
 rapproachment  between  France   and      the
 United States. Although our discussions were
 In the area of space science and aviation the
 excellent relationship our delegation estab-
 lished with the Deputies proved that there
 Is a basis for sound partnership between
 France and the United States- if we can cir-
 cumvent De Gaulle and correct some mis-
 conceptions on the Deputies' part.
 We discussed with the Deputies the prob-
 lems of overflight and sonic boominvolved
 in their Concorde and our Supersonic Trans-
 port. They had little background in these
 important areas and we had the opportunity
 to share our knowledge and experiences with
 them.
 If I appear optimistic about the long-term
 effect of our visit, Mr. Chairman, I have rea-
 son to. There will be a meeting in September
 between a group of Deputies, led by a leading
 Gaullist, Charles de Chambrun, and several
 representatives of our space committee. The
 purpose of the meeting will be to hold pre-
 liminary discussions on questions of mutual
 interest to both countries. This is just an
 example of many important areas in which
 the United States and France can cooperate.
 Mr. Chairman, the Congressional delega-
 tion to the International Air Show returned
 proud and optimistic. Our country Is the
 world leader in aviation and In space. Our fu-
 ture is bright. And that future may enjoy
 the additional benefit of increased coopera-
 tion between the United States and an old
 friend, France, on matters of mutual interest.
 Respectfully,
 LESTER L. WOLFF,
 Member of Congress.
 BANK CRIMES
 (Mr. FASCELL (at the request of Mr.
 VANIK)  was granted permission to ex-
 tend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. FASCELL. Mr. Speaker, on May 25,
 1967, I called the attention of the House_
 to an article which appeared in the
 American Banker by Mr. J. Edgar Hoover
 on the subject of crimes against banking
 institutions.
 These crimes have been a subject of
 continuing concern to the Subcommittee
 on Legal and Monetary Affairs of the
 House Committee on Government Opera-
 tions, of which subcommittee I am chair-
 man. In my statement on May 25 I men-
 tioned the hearings we held in 1963 on
 the problem of bank crimes and reported
 some of the findings and recommenda-
 tions we made at that time.
 Two events in the Washington area
 this week have dramatically underscored
 the continuing validity of the findings,
 conclusions, and recommendations of the
 subcommittees. These two events have
 impressed me once again with the ur-
 gency of our need for improved security
 in our banking institutions.
 On Monday. June 19, 1967, a man
 walked into the Wildwood Center branch
 of the Bank of Bethesda carrying a paper
 bag. He threatened that the bag con-
 tained dynamite and that he would blow
 up the building if the employees did not
 give him access to the vault. He walked
 out of the bank carrying $78,700 and he
 remains at large.
 The Washington Post for Wednedsay,
 June 21, 1967, carried an article on the
 closure of the Oxon Hill branch of the
 Southern Maryland Bank & Trust Co.
 Bank officials state that the closing of
 this branch is due to conditions beyond
 their control. The "conditions" were
 identified as five armed holdups in the
 18 months since December 1965.
 These two examples are merely isolat-
 ed cases originating in the same general
 area but, according to articles in the
 June 1967 issues of Protective Bulletin-
 issued by the Insurance and Protective
 Committee of the American Bankers As-
 sociation-and Banking: Journal of the
 American Bankers Association, the num-
 bers                                                  of  burglaries,  robberies,  and
 larcenies affecting banking institutions
 have been rising steadily throughout the
 nation during the last few years.
 Mr. J. Edgar Hoover's answers to ques-
 tions incorporated in the article in the
 June 1967 issue of Banking indicate his
 belief- that the increase in bank crimes
 is partially due to increased numbers of
 branch banks in suburban areas.
 Mr. Hoover said:
 Such banks, by the nature of their locality
 and design, are easier to rob and burglarize.
 The buildings generally have fewer security
 features; they areeasier to "case" and scout
 prior to the job; police protection is less
 concentrated; and escape routes are more
 accessible and better concealed.
 The Protective Bulletin of June 1967
 states:
 There are certain external and internal
 conditions about a bank which can either
 favor or discourage an after dark attack.
 In addition, the bulletin says:
 The initial line of defense against
 burglars is the bank building itself.
 Especially important is the design of
 doors, windows, ventilation ducts, and
 other openings into the building which
 could be utilized for entrance.
 The report of the Legal and Monetary
 Affairs - - Subcommittee which was ap-
 proved and published on February 20,
 1964, includedthe following findings and
 conclusions:          -
 Modern bank design and the increase in
 outlying branches have contributed to the
 increase in bank holdups. -
 There is a direct relationship between the
 lack of security and the incidence of external
 crimes.
 There is ample information available on
 the means of preventing both internal and
 external crimes. There are numerous aids and
 devices available for use in the prevention
 of crimes and for the apprehension of crimi-
 nals. However, many bankers- resist the use
 of these means and devices.
 Practically all losses by banking institu-
 tions resulting from crimes are covered by
 insurance. While insurance protects the in-
 stitutions, its existence has had a tendency
 in some cases to make bank management lax
 as regards security against banking crimes.
 The incidence of these crimes con-
 tinues to increase despite repeated warn-
 ings and persuasion from Congress, the
 trade journals, responsible bankers, Fed-
 eral and State regulatory agencies, and
 banking associations; in spite of bank
 examiners' interest and emphasis on
 security measures; in spite of full co-
 operation by the  FBI and local law
 enforcement agencies; and in spite of
 increasing reluctance of insurance com-
 panies to underwrite low security banks.
 I find it very discouraging that bank-
 ing institutions, the backbone of the
 business community and the pillar of
 dependability, have not taken sufficient
 precautions to reduce these crimes sig-
 nificantly. The burden of responsibility
 for the continued vulnerability of banks
 and jeopardy to customers' accounts and
 valuables lies squarely and undisputably
 on bank management. Over the years
 bank management, with the concurrence
 of the regulatory agencies and banking
 associations, has taken the position that
 it is management's responsibility to de-
 termine what security measures are to
 be utilized in each individual bank.
 In 1964 the Legal and Monetary Af-
 fairs Subcommittee made a number of
 recommendations designed to prevent
 these crimes. We believe that if our rec-
 ommendations had been completely ac-
 cepted and fully implemented by positive
 action on the part of the regulatory
 agencies  and  the individual bankers
 there would have been no increase in the
 number of bank crimes. There could have
 been a decrease. Furthermore, we be-
 lieve that the  recommendations con-
 tained In our report are still applicable

 such as those in Central Park cannot be
 tolerated just. as murder is not tolerated.
 It is tragic that H.R. 10480 was ever
 needed, but the lack of patriotism by
 some few Americans made this bill
 mandatory. It is time that we consider
 what caused this loss of patriotism in
 America, and I think the first place we
 should look is to some of the recent
 Federal Court decisions.

 (Mr. HATHAWAY (at the request of

 Mr. HATHAWAY. Mr. Speaker, much
 has been said on the floor of the House
 during the past 2 years about the Dickey-
 Lincoln School hydroelectric project in
 appeared concerning an Appropriatio s
 Committee staff study.of this project It
 is with great pleasure that I brin  to
 your attention today an editorial from
 the Evening Bulletin of Providence R.I.
 This article shares my belief tha  the
 committee staff study report is favo able
 to the project, and that the construe ion
 of the Dickey-Lincoln School hydroel -
 tric  project  should proceed withou
 further delay.
 The editorial follows:
 A SENSIBLE PROJECT
 Congress is in a sound position to proceed
 with the Dickey-Lincoln public power proj-
 ect in Maine now that the thicket of con-
 tradictory statements  about  its  economic
 value has been cut away.
 Tho  controversial hydroelectric project
 conceived to relieve New Englanders from
 the highest power rates in the country was
 authorized in 1965, but getting planning ap-
 propriations through Congress has been like
 pulling teeth.
 The reason was that Congress did not
 know whom to believe. Federal agencies like
 the Federal Power Commission and the Army
 Corps of Engineers have said right along
 that the project is economically feasible,
 whereas the Electric Coordinating Council

 completed    !view of studies by public and
 private   encies concerning the potential of
 Dick~~SS:Lincoln. In the process, it has dis-
 crited many statistics submitted by the
 groups opposing the project.
 The staff reports that federally financed
 nuclear or fossil-fuel plants in Boston and
 Maine would produce cheaper power than
 Dickey-Lincoln, but that privately financed
 sources of power-subject as they are to
 higher debt costs and taxes-would not. On
 the other hand, says the staff, the Dickey
 project would afford flood protection and
 create new recreation centers which would
 not be the case with either federally or pri-
 vately                                             financed  nuclear  or  conventional

 reached the opposite conclusion-that cost
 would exceed the value of benefits-but the
 staff contends the council erred in that con-
 clusion by figuring the life of the project at
 50 years instead of 100 years.
 Clearing up the point is vital because
 Congress puts much weight on benefit-cost
 ratio in helping it decide which public proj-
 ects to undertake. In the last four years, it

 ANNUNZIO cat the request of Mr.

 and to include extraneous matter.)
 - Mr. ANNUNZIO. Mr. Speaker, I would
 like to call to the attention of my col-
 leagues a news release issued by the arch-
 diocese of New York on June 19, 1967,
 stating that the archdiocese will join
 the American Bar Association this sum-'
 mer in a program aimed at disseminating
 greater knowledge about the differences
 between democracy and communism.
 I commend the distinguished and
 'great American, Francis Cardinal Spell-
 ma i --fQr the forthright position he has
 taken on this g?articular problem and for
 relenting war against      unism being
 waged by all freedom-lovin   mericans.
 Recently, Cardinal Spellman declared
 that when students read Lenin,   o Tse-
 tung, and others, "they can                                                        e for
 themselves that class war, deceptio , sub-
 version and the strategy of terror re not
 outworn myths butthe preferred nstru-
 ments Of the Communist Party."
 It is important, therefore, th t we ac-
 quaint ourselves with the facts, of totali-
 tarian life, in order that we may become
 better equipped to protect any encroach-
 ment on our prgcious liberties and on the
 Francis Cardinal Spellman announced to-
 day (June 19) that the Archdiocese of New
 York will join with the American Bar Asso-
 ciation this summer to equip social studies
 teachers throughout the archdiocesan school
 system with greater knowledge of the differ-
 ences between Democracy and Communism.
 A program developed by the ABA's Stand-
 ing Committee on Education About Com-
 munism and its Contrast With Liberty Under
 Law will be telecast via the Archdiocesan In-
 structional Television Network to some 200
 teachers in 90 Catholic high schools over a
 15-week period.
 The ABA Committee instituted the pro-
 gram five years ago when it discovered that
 U.S. school teachers as a whole were "woe-
 fully lacking" In the background needed to
 acquaint students with the facts of totali-
 tarian life, according to ABA president, Ori-
 son Marden, who also attended the meeting
 at Cardinal Spellman's residence.
 Mr. Marden, a senior partner in the New
 York firm of White and Case, said the Com-
 mittee since  1962 has furnished lecturers
 nea     10,000 high  school  teachers  in  45
 states, who in turn have reached an esti-
 mated                                                                                                                              ,000,000 students.
 These   institutes,  normally offering aca-
 demic c edit, have been held, he said, at such
 center  of learning as the universities of
 Colo  do, Miami, Southern California and
 V  derbilt, demonstrating "to the satisfac-
 Communism is no longer controversial"
 Cardinal Spellman said that three inter-
 acting historical trends make it timely to
 add this type of program to the social studies
 curriculum of the Archdiocese: the ecumen-
 ical movement with its emphasis on per-
 spective; the growing responsibility of the
 U.S. to preserve stability in world affairs;
 and the increasing importance of electron-
 ics communications media as aids to edu-
 cation.
 The Archdiocese of New York is composed
 of  ten  counties:  Manhattan,  Richmond,
 Bronx, Westchester, Rockland, Orange, Put-
 nam, Sullivan, Dutchess and Ulster.
 "While America cherishes the right to dis-
 sent," Cardinal Spellman said, "debate is al-
 ways improved if the participants have done
 their homework. When students read Lenin,
 Mao Tse-Tung, Stalin and :Lin Piao, they
 can see for themselves that class war, de-
 ception, subversion and the strategy of terror
 are not outworn myths but the preferred
 instruments of the Communist Party.
 "In our revolutionary world it is vital that
 understanding of social justice, individual
 responsibilities and threats to world order
 keep pace with rapid scientific discovery.
 Young Americans are idealists, looking for
 meaning in their own lives and for good
 causes to serve. The freedom and well-be-
 ing of people all over the world for years
 to come may depend in no small measure
 on the wisdom and competence of ascend-
 ing generations in this nation."
 The ABA program, it was explained, fea-
 tures, academic experts, journalists and con-
 sultants to government on such subjects as:
 (1) The Principles and Potential of Modern
 Democracy; (2) Permanent Factors in Soviet
 Foreign and Defense. Policy; (3) Soviet and
 Chinese Youth Today; (4) Communist Prop-
 aganda Techniques; (5) Schisms in the Em-
 pire of Marx; and (6) Modern Capitalism
 and the Economic Dogma of Marx.
 Each lecturer or panelist is cross-examined
 by a team of  outstanding teachers who
 relate problems in the  classroom to the
 expertise of the scholar.

 In an atmosphere of mounting tension,

 likely to continue in both places. It still
 may go forward anyway, but the Johnson-

 a little time to discuss whether it is in any-
 body's interest to continue along this same
 costly military journey.
 Similarly, Moscow and Washington are on
 the verge of a spectacular new phase of the
 arms race. The President and particularly
 Secretary McNamara have been extremely
 reluctant to get into the development of an
 anti-balistic  missile  system,  which  would
 cost about $60 billion in the next seven
 years, but the more the tension mounts and
 spreads from Vietnam to the Middle East,
 the more likely it is that this upward spiral
 of rearmament will continue.
 The question now is not whether Johnson
 and Kosygin have been able to deal with the
 details of these questions-obviously they
 have not-but whether they can get at the
 heart of the problem, which is the dominion
 of fear on both sides, and whether they can

 FCC "Fairness" Rule on Cigarettes Seems
 Ominous
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. BOB WILSON
 OF CALIFORNIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, June 26,. 1967
 Mr. BOB WILSON. Mr. Speaker, under
 leave to extend my remarks in the REC-
 ORD, I include the following:
 FCC "FAIRNEs$" RULE ON CIGARETTES SEEMS
 OMINOUS
 There's no particular panic among broad-
 casters over the Federal Communications
 Commission's recent statement on cigarette
 advertising, but there is plenty of long-term
 concern. It isn't the statement itself that has
 them worried, it's the questions posed by the
 extension of the so-called "fairness doctrine"
 into the area of advertising.
 _ TV already carries specials on smoking and
 has  tagged  commercials  as  controversial
 broadcasts within the meaning of the "doc-
 trine," and this raises some very involved
 questions.
 A primary question, of course, is the pos-
 sibility that this ruling may be further ex-
 tended to other advertising-beer commer-
 cials, for example-which some viewer may
 consider controversial. For the present, at
 least, the FCC's intention apparently is to
 limit the ruling to cigarettes on the grounds
 that they have been rated a possible health
 hazard. But the precedent has been set.
 Second, what it adequate airing of the
 other side? Unlike the "equal time" provi-
 sion, the "fairness doctrine" does not require
 a minute-for-minute rebuttal it lets the
 station decide what's "fair." When it comes
 to commercials, this may be difficult to assess.
 who can trace their lineage back, are of
 slave ancestry. There are many who
 worked their way through college and
 law school as have many whites.
 But there are also Negro lawyers who
 are - morally and professionally honest
 and dedicated to the American constitu-
 tional Government under which the
 United States will survive, or without
 which our country will perish. Marshall's
 appointment must, then, have been for
 some other consideration than that he
 was a deserving Negro.
 The record of Thurgood Marshall as
 a scamp, a cheat, and user of false evi-
 dence in the Brown case was restated in
 port at page 13. What a minute     a of
 difference between Marsh! _U'   emeanor
 in the Brown case fr    the crime of
 bribing judges, g Ate use of a bought
 witness with   rjured testimony at a
 trial. Is n   he witnesses' oath to "tell
 the tr   , the whole truth, and nothing
 but  e truth"?
 e bought his verdict and now the
 appointment to the Supreme Court.
 Cheating dare not prosper-for if it
 prosper none dare call it cheating. His
 record and past deeds offer more basis
 for removal from office than for eleva-
 tion to the bench.
 Mr. Speaker, I include the U.S. News
 World Report article following my com-
 ANsIDE STORY OF THE MARSHALL ROLE IN
 T  E SCHOOL-DESEGREGATION DECISION
 Insight into theattitude of Thurgood Mar-
 shall toward the Constitution and the law is
 revealed in a speech that was made on Dec.
 28, 1961, by a history professor.
 This speech is getting attention of Sen-
 ators. It was made by Alfred H. Kelly, pro-
 fessor of history at Wayne State University,
 Detroit, before the American Historical--As-
 sociation in Washington, D.C.
 In July, 1953, Thurgood Marshall, as coun-
 sel for the National Association for the Ad-
 vancement of Colored People, had asked Mr.
 Kelly--among others-to prepare a research
 paper on the intent of framers of the Four-
 teenth Amendment with respect to constitu-
 tionality of segregated schools.     -
 LE" CASE
 for argument before the Supreme Court. Aim
 of the brief, said Mr. Kelly, was to provide a
 "plausible" historical case for ruling that the
 Fourteenth Amendment was intended by its
 framers to forbid racial segregation.
 Mr. Kelly joined the research group, which
 included 125 historians, political scientists
 ,
 constitutional lawyers and educators. Their
 conference was held in September of 1953.
 "Ten days later, early in October," Mr.
 Kelly told the Historical Association, "I was
 surprised to receive a phone call from Thur-
 good Marshall.... My help, he said with
 careful flattery, was needed very badly on the
 brief. My vanity thus touched to the quick,
 I came."
 This time there was a group of 12. The
 result of their work was a paper based, Mr.
 Kelly said, "on the theory that it would not
 do to get too far involved in specific historical
 detail with respect to framer intent, and that
 the association's case might best be- cast, in
 very  generalized  terms  with  a  deliberate
 avoidance of the particular."
 Mr. Kelly continued in his address:
 "This tactic, Marshall now -informed us,
 might get past two or three of the Justices,
 tices] Fra      ter or Douglas. 'I gotta argue
 these cases,' Th    ood said, 'and- if I try this
 approach, those fel    s will shoot me down
 "I am very much air    that for the next
 few days I ceased to func 'on as a historian
 and, instead, took up the pro ti e of law with-
 out a license. The problem    faced was not
 the historian's discovery of the truth, the
 whole truth and nothing b the truth; the
 problem instead was the f ulation of an
 adequate gloss on the fa  ful events of 1866
 sufficient to convince   e Court that we had
 something of a h    rival case.
 "It is no     at we were engaged in for-
 mulate      es; there was nothing as crude
 sliding off facts, quietly ignoring facts, and,
 above all, interpreting facts in a way to do
 what Marshall said we had to do-'get by
 those boys down there.'
 "There was one optimistic element in all
 this, as Marshallpointed out: It was obvious
 that the Court was looking for a plausible
 historical answer....
 "In other words, Marshall said, we didn't
 need to win a historical argument hands
 down-all we needed was a face-saving draw.
 'A nothing-to-nothing score,' Marshall put it,
 'means we win the ball game.' I believe, by
 the way, that this was a correct interpreta-
 tion of the Court's mood....
 "gradually,  in the next three  days,  we
 hammered out a strategy....
 "The Fourteenth Amendment, we told our-
 selves, had been necessary to accomplish a
 vast sweep of purpose far beyond the Civil
 Rights Act. Here we came down hard on
 [Senator Jacob Merritt] Howard's announce-
 ment that the purpose of the Amendment
 had been to abolish all class and caste in the
 United States. And we pounced on a phrase
 Jay Graham [a constitutional historian] had
 dug up: Bingham [Represents;ive John A.
 Bingham], in defending the Amendment in
 the House, had indeed said Congress now
 was writing a constitutional provision, not
 drafting a statute;  that statutes are writ
 sharp and narrow and specific but constitu-
 tions are writ broad for ages yet unborn... ,
 "This is the argument, essentially, that
 you will find incorporated in the historical
 portions of the NAACP brief as it went to
 the Court. This is the argument Marshall
 used in oral argument in answer to questions
 from the Justices... ,

 Finally, there's some feeling that the com-
 mission may have staged an end-run around
 Congress, which had the option of laying
 down conditions for broadcast advertising for
 cigarettes and didn't exercise it.
 All these points have to be weighs

 Mr. RARICK. M. Speaker, whatever

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. JACK EDWARDS
 OF ALABAMA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, June 26, 1967
 Mr.    EDWARDS  of  Alabama.  Mr.
 Speaker, in matters of foreign policy, we
 as Americans have been advised that we
 must "think the unthinkable" as a means
 of breaking new ground in the solution
 of great and grave problems.
 Perhaps one of the assumptions we
 should challenge is the assumption that
 we must be everybody's pal-that U.S.
 foreign policy must be geared to popu-
 larity on a comprehensive worldwide
 basis.
 This has special significance at this
 time in the wake of the Johnson-Kosygin
 meeting and the maneuverings relating
 to the Middle East. And at this point in
 my remarks I want to call attention to
 a newspaper column by Jenkin Lloyd
 Jones of June 24, 1967: ,
 IT'S TIME To BE STIFFLY CORRECT
 (By Jenkin Lloyd Jones)
 The time may have arrived when the Amer-
 ican                            people  should  quit  trying  to  be so
 puppy-dog friendly to the world and assume
 a more dignified posture of "correctness."
 Americans are, perhaps, the friendliest peo-
 ple on earth. Part of it comes from our
 bigness and isolation. At home we see few
 foreigners. An alien accent intrigues us. In
 any erudite cocktail party the crowd is gen-
 erally thickest around the foreign visitor.
 the heathen. They had their heroic mission-
 aries and teachers who went forth Into the
 pools of ignorance and fever to discourage
 infanticide,  stop  cannibalism and outlaw
 suttee. But hard on their heels came the
 flag and the traders.
 As the Basuto chief bitterly told one of
 my old anthropology professors, "When the
 white man came here he had the Bible and
 we had the land. Now we've got the Bible
 and he's got the land."
 Among the more recent colonial powers you
 might classify, in descending order of hu-
 manity, the French, the Dutch, the Belgians,
 the Germans and the Japanese. The Russians
 were never well enough organized in the 18th
 and 19th  centuries to seize distant lands
 from primitive peoples. But in their conquest
 and treatment of the European satellites they
 would go to the bottom of the list.
 Only the Americans were haunted by their
 strength and nervous about their prosperity.
 Only the Americans set forth wistfully to
 make the world love them.
 Funny thing. The Israelis bombed a U.N.
 force in the Gaza Strip and nine Indian and
 two Brazilian soldiers were killed. The diplo-
 mats in the U.N. Security Council all tried
 to top each other in expressions of regret
 and grief. But 54,000 Americans died in what
 was billed as an official U.N. action in Korea.
 How much weeping did the United Nations
 do for our boys?
 There is the human inclination to make
 the friend of your enemy your enemy. All
 our largesse to India was forgotten the mo-
 ment we gave arms to Pakistan. And the
 Pakistanis damned us for our aid to India.
 For many years Americans tried to make
 themselves loved in the Near East. The Amer-
 ican University in Beirut has educated gen-
 erations of Arab leaders. We were lavish with
 Fulbright scholarships. We poured tremen-
 dous aid funds into Arab nations, including
 those whose oil-rich sheiks bought Cadillacs
 by the shipload and rented whole hotels in
 Switzerland.
 But because America has promoted Israel
 we  were  hated.  And  when  Gamal  Abdel
 Nasser, in the bleak early hours of June 6,
 tried to alibi the collapse of his air force by
 claiming that American and British planes
 had shot  it  down,  the  whole  Near East
 bought it immediately. Mobs converged on
 the American embassies. The American li-
 braries went up in flames.
 Maybe we ought to relax. Maybe we should
 quit trying to be loved. Maybe we should
 assume that we will be spit on. America is
 a complacent dragon, a fine beast on which
 to beat with wooden swords and have one's
 picture taken standing on its back. Hatred
 of it is a huge convenience for a government
 entangled in Its own stupidity.
 So be it. If we expect to be hated we will
 be freer to do intelligent things. We won't
 have to keep shoring up corrupt regimes in
 the  hope  that  they will  become reliable
 friends. We can spend our foreign aid more
 wisely. We can seal  off some famous rat
 holes.
 We can say, "Look, your excellency. Your
 mob burnt our free library, which happens
 to be the biggest and best in your country.
 If you want it back, jail the leaders and
 We have, for a long time, suffered from a           build us a building. We'll just replace the

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. FRED SCHWENGEL
 OF IOWA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, June 26, 1967
 Mr. SCHWENGEL. Mr. Speaker, re-
 cently Bob Waterman assumed the presi-
 dency of the Davenport Chamber of
 Commerce. He will provide forward and
 constructive leadership in a growing and
 rapidly developing community.
 A writer for the Davenport Times-
 Democrat interviewed Mr. Waterman
 and wrote the following story about him:
 RIVER IS A  TREMENDOUS  ADVANTAGE-CHAL-
 LENGES AHEAD FOR CHAMBER CHIEF
 (By Julie Jensen)
 The  first  mountain Robert Van Patten
 Waterman ever climbed was the Matterhorn,
 and this response to challenge augurs well
 for the Davenport Chamber of Commerce,
 which has elevated the Davenport attorney
 to its presidency.
 Waterman stands out in a crowd with an
 imposing height of six-foot-three. Brown-
 eyed with silver-touched dark hair and a
 robust complexion, he radiates elan.
 He is a general partner in a law firm of
 nine partners and associates, including his
 two older brothers, Larned, and C. D. Water-
 man Jr. His father and grandfather were
 lawyers before him. '
 His executive duties for the Chamber will
 be demanding, and Waterman says, "I'll have
 to find more hours in the day. I don't want
 to reduce my time in the legal profession,
 so I suppose it means less leisure and more
 weekend work."
 "I have been involved with the Chamber of
 Commerce for about eight years," he says.
 "The Chamber is commiting itself to some
 form  of  urban  re-development  to     make
 Davenport competitive with other cities. This
 takes   money-either   private   or   public
 funds-and there is a departure from earlier
 thinking  that  federal funds   are  tainted
 per se.
 "The philosophy now is that federal funds
 for a useful purpose are acceptable, and there
 is nothing morally wrong with attempting to
 regain some of our tax dollars."
 Rebuilding the city's sewer system, dealing
 with substandard housing problems, and pro-
 viding an expressway from Interstate 80 to
 the heart of downtown are Davenport's pri-
 ority concerns, Waterman believes.
 "Cities  of  lesser size  are making  great
 strides in development," he says, "and we
 cannot lag behind. We do need help. There
 isn't enough private capital, and we're paying
 such high taxes that we should have some of
 that money back. If we make plans, we can
 maintain local control.
 "We  are  in  a fact-facing  era,  and the
 philosophy of the past is changing to the
 practical idealism of the present."
 The downtown business area faces slow
 strangulation without a quick, convenient in-
 gress to its core, Waterman holds.
 "Enlightened self-interest calls for some
 kind of an expressway to the downtown area,"
 he says.
 Keeping up with the working of 21 Cham-
 ber committees may keep the new president
 off the golf course, but he says he really
 doesn't mind.

 of 16 and 18," he says, "and I've never re-
 covered my former glory!"

 It was May 2, 1958, and it was high noon.
 Soon, one of the two Unknowns of World
 War II would be selected as the Unknown
 to represent all the American dead of the
 war.  The  other would  be hurried  at sea
 with full military honors.

 sons, our brothers, our fathers, our friends,
 and for all of us they gave 'that last full
 measure of devotion'."
 A wreath of red and white carnations rested
 inboard of the caskets. It would serve as the
 badge of distinction to denote which of the
 two Unknowns would be selected for the
 singular honor being bestowed that day.
 PICKED  BY NAVY  HERO
 The choice was to be made by William
 R. Charette, a Navy hospital corpsman first
 class, who won the Medal of Honor for su-
 preme heroism on the battlefields of Korea.
 There  was  high  drama            in  the  air  as
 Charette came forward and picked up the
 wreath with deliberate precision.
 He walked slowly with it back around the
 three caskets, then stopped facing the one
 in the center, the one holding the body of
 the Unknown of Korea.
 Which of the World War II Unknowns
 would be selected to represent them all?
 For several moments Charette stood abso-
 lutely still, almost rigid, as though he'd been
 painted there by some great artist preserving
 a moment in time no one wanted repeatpdr'
 Charette was contemplative, tight-lipped.
 The rain that had pocketed the day in
 grey suddenly lifted and the-seas around us
 quieted somewhat.
 The moment had come. The choice was
 made.
 "I DON'T KNOW WHY"
 Charette turned, then gently, with rever-
 ence for the occasion, placed the wreath on
 the casket on the right. He had started to
 place it on the one on the left, but sud-
 denly changed his mind. "I don't know why,
 I just turned to the right," he said later.

 Is the United Nations Still Useful?
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. ABRAHAM J. MULTER
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, June 26, 1967
 Mr. MULTER. Mr. Speaker, due to re-
 cent actions taken by Secretary General
 U Thant in the Middle East crisis, the
 usefulness of the Secretary General and
 of the United Nations itself, has come in-
 to question.
 Two columns recently appearing in
 the Washington Star, dealt with, first,
 U Thant's illegal assumption of author-
 ity to unilaterally remove the Emer-
 gency Force from the Middle East, and
 second, the future of the United Nations
 as an effective peacekeeping organiza-
 tion.
 I commend to the attention of our col-
 leagues the following columns written
 by David Lawrence and Ralph McGill,
 which appeared in the June 21, 1967, edi-
 tion of the Washington Star.
 The articles follow:
 THANT'S USEFULNESS QUESTIONED
 The usefulness of U Thant as secretary-
 general of the United Nations has come into
 question, Without placing the matter before
 the        U.N.  General  Assembly,  he  granted
 promptly last month President Nasser's re-
 quest that the U.N. peace-keeping force be
 withdrawn from the armistice line on the
 Israel border. This .led to the outbreak of
 hostilities in the Middle East.
 Two pertinent documents now have been
 made public. One plainly sets forth the views
 of the late Dag Hammarskjold, who, as sec-
 retary-general in 1956, arranged with Presi-
 dent Nasser for the U.N. force to go on duty
 at the armistice line and-stay there "until the
 task of the force was completed." The other
 Is the reply just made by Thant to the Ham-
 marskjold memorandum.
 It Is clear that Hammarskjold knew there
 was a delicate point involved, and he left
 for future guidance a carefully written record
 and analysis of the whole subject. Thant now
 brushes this aside as an Interpretation not
 binding upon him.
 But there is a difference between an argu-
 ment over the right of Egypt to ask for the
 withdrawal of the U.N.'s peace-keeping force
 and the obligation of the secretary-general
 to submit the whole matter to the General
 Assembly for its consideration and decision.
 The real Issue is what Secretary-General
 Thant should have done about Egypt's re-
 quest. He consulted on May 17 with the
 members of the advisory committee of the
 United Nations Emergency Force-represent-
 atives of India, Norway, Sweden, Denmark,
 Brazil, Yugoslavia and Canada. Some of these
 envoys warned  him that  he  should take
 the matter up with the General Assembly.
 Unfortunately,  however,  the  secretary-
 geileral had already advised Egypt that, if it
 formally requested withdrawal of the peace-
 keeping force, this would be granted. It was
 really not too late even then for a special
 meeting of the General Assembly to be called
 to deal with the problem, but Thant took no
 such steps and said that "it is not within
 the competence of the General Assembly to
 act," He felt that he himself had no choice
 but to grant the request from Nasser for the
 withdrawal. This he did on May 18.
 The Hammarskjold memorandum of Au-
 gust 1957, on the other hand, argued these
 same points and emphasized that Egypt had
 made a "good faith" agreement not to with-
 draw its "consent" to the presence of the
 peace-keeping force without submitting the
 matter to the General Assembly, The late
 secretary-general wrote:
 "My starting point in the consideration of
 this last-mentioned problem-the limitation
 of Egypt's sovereign-right In the interest of
 political balance and stability in the United
 Nations Emergency Force operation-was the
 fact that Egypt had spontaneously endorsed
 the General Assembly resolution of Nov. 5,
 1956 (creating the force)  and by endorsing
 that resolution had consented to the pres-
 ence of the United Nations Emergency Force
 for certain tasks. They could thus not ask
 the UNEF to withdraw before the completion
 of the tasks without running up against
 their own acceptance of the resolution on
 the force and its tasks."
 Hammarskjold also mentions that he put
 squarely to President Nasser the necessity
 for an "agreement on withdrawal" with re-
 spect to the peace-keeping force, and told
 him that, "unless an agreement of this type
 was made," the secretary-general would rec-
 ommend to the General Assembly the im-
 mediate withdrawal of troops which had just
 been sent In to police the armistice. Egypt's
 president was so anxious to have the peace-
 keeping force established that he acquiesced
 in the agreement.
 The  present  secretary-general  now  says
 that, while he was aware of the Hammar-
 skjold memorandum, it was not an "Official
 document." But the points made cannot be
 erased. For the duty of the secretary-general
 is not to resolve such an important issue
 himself but to leave this to the United Na-
 tions, of which he is merely an administra-
 tive official.
 The making of vital decisions is the func-
 tion of the Security Council or of the Gen-
 eral Assembly as set forth in the Charter
 itself. As it turned out, the one-man ruling
 gave   encouragement   to  Egypt,  which
 promptly mobilized its forces on the borders
 of  Israel,  and  war  ensued. Certainly the
 United Nations should provide against a
 recurrence of such blunders,
 FUTURE  OF UNITED NATIONS SEEN IN PERIL
 What is the future of the United Nations?
 Is the Middle Eastern crisis the beginning
 of a renaissance? Or is the U.N. sun setting?
 The Soviet Union has been making much
 use of the U.N. Security Council. It was a
 somewhat abrasive and critical Nikolai Fedo-
 renko who demanded a hurried, immediate
 "emergency" session of the council on that
 fateful Wednesday, June 7, when the Israeli
 successes in the Sinai deeprt and against
 Jordan were confirmed.
 Yet, this was the same Fedorenko who on
 Monday before that Wednesday brusquely
 had refused the U.S. recommendation that a
 cease-fire be sought.
 Again, on Thursday, June 8, the Security
 Council was summonded back. Once more
 the pleasant-looking, bow-tie wearing, pipe-
 smoking Fedorenko used the session to con-
 demn the United States, and to demand the
 Israelis return all they had gained in war.
 It was possible, sitting there in the press
 section of the council chamber to feel the
 almost tangible Irony, the cynical brazenness
 of the situation.
 It Is chiefly the Russians, though not en-
 tirely so, who have not paid their financial
 allotments due the United Nations. It is
 largely their financial neglect, followed by
 others in their block,  that has kept the
 United Nations close to the abyss of bank-
 ruptcy and substantially reduced the or-
 ganization's prestige and potential for ac-
 tion. That the Russians should have so vig-
 orously sought to use the United Nations
 only when, and after the Arab allies had
 made their war thrust and been defeated-
 serve merely to etch deeper the irony of that
 neglect.
 A 3249
 With the U.N. prestige and potential thus
 minimized, the international arena was, of
 necessity, reduced to power operations.
 The Middle East buildup was open. There
 was no secret about it. Nasser mobilized his
 troops, Nasser demanded that United Nations
 security troops be withdrawn from the Gaza
 strip. The alacrity with which Secretary Gen-
 eral U Thant complied has damaged him
 and the United Nations. The Israelis are un-
 comfortably  right  in  charging  that  U.N.
 actions had encouraged the Arabs to war.
 There was undenied escalation of raids into
 Israel by Shukeiry's "Palestine Legion" and
 by the Al Assifa (the Storm)  guerillas of
 Syria. It Is members of these groups who
 have maintained sniping since the accept-
 ance of the cease-fire.
 The Soviet Union holds the solution to the
 future of the Middle East. The Russians can
 proceed to rearm the Arabs with tanks, MIG
 aircraft and weapons. They can, in and out
 of the United Nations, promote discord rather
 than a settlement the Arabs can reluctantly
 accept. The Israelis will not want to keep the
 Sinai. They have a right to hold the high
 ground along the borders of Syria from which
 came the mortar and shell are aaginst valley
 and  villages-and,  of  course,  against  the
 guerilla raids of Al Assifa. The Gulf of Aqaba
 must be open to all shipping, The United
 Nations-and the Russians-were silent when
 Egypt blockaded Aqaba as a part of the pre-
 war preparations by Nasser.
 Jerusalem might be internationalized-if
 the United Nations is made viable by Soviet
 support and cooperation.
 Soviet "interest" In Africa remains higher
 than commitment to the United Nations,
 Nasser had Soviet aid In Aden, at the en-
 trance to the Red Sea. The Somalis had Soviet
 help across from Aden at the Red Sea en-
 trance. Algeria is the latest "Interest" in
 Africa-and the Middle East.
 The outlook is complex and, at best, hidden
 by intrigues, feuds, angers and ambitions,
 The United Nations could be entering a new
 phase of usefulness. Or, it could be under-
 going cynical "use" for non-peaceful objec-
 tives. If so, the United Nations, God forbid,
 may be on its way out.

 HON: DONALD J. IRWIN

 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, June 26, 1967
 Mr. IRWIN. Mr. Speaker, in a com-
 mencement address last month to the
 graduating class of the State University
 of New York at Buffalo, President King-
 man Brewster, Jr., of Yale University,
 discussed dissent in a democratic society.
 The newspaper coverage intrigued me
 and, now that I have read the speech in
 its entirety, I find my curiosity well
 rewarded.
 Seldom have I seen a more succinct
 analysis of the politics of polarization
 and accommodation; or a more eloquent
 plea for the restraint and tolerance
 which permit a democratic society to en-
 joy freedom and grow through diversity.
 President Brewster advocated no easy
 solution to our involvement in Vietnam,
 which is the subject of much of today's
 agonizing debate. But he emphasized
 that the terms of that debate are of crit-

 still falls on the Israeli side of the scales,
 why, that is where it falls.
 Mr. Eban in the General Assembly gave
 Israel's case in full, and eloquently. Speak-
 ing after Premier Kosygin, he laid upon the
 Soviet Union a heavy responsibility for the
 war its proteges lost, and rejected as totally
 inacceptable to Israel a return to the situ-
 ation of June 5, as called for by Russia and
 the Arabs. To return, he said, would be to
 try to "reconstruct a broken egg." Beyond
 that, he suggested concessions to the Arabs,
 with Jordanian access to the Mediterranean
 as an example, but made it plain that peace
 in the region Arabs and Israelis are "destined

 should, of course, do what they can to re-

 It is perhaps a small base from which to
 build a useful dialogue, but Mr. Johnson and
 Kosygin did agree on one point: that Israel
 has the right to a national life. Kosygin's
 U.N. speech was not constructive, and his
 walkout  during  Eban's  reply  cannot  be
 ignored or excused. Yet the speech was de-
 livered in a restrained manner, without any
 shoe-banging or other pyrotechnic effects.
 Some think Kosygin's comparative restraint
 left the door open for a meeting with Presi-
 dent Johnson. Perhaps it did. And possibly
 talks  between  the two men could  be of
 value at this time.
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. EDWARD A. GARMATZ
 OF MARYLAND        .
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, June 26, 1967
 Mr. GARMATZ. Mr. Speaker, I am
 glad to report that the Nation's press is
 paying a deserved tribute to President
 Johnson's handling of the Middle East
 crisis. There is almost unanimous agree-
 ment that our President has followed a
 responsible,  prudent,  and  reasonable
 course in the Middle East-a course that
 certainly contrasts sharply with that of
 the Soviet Union.
 I believe this editorial opinion reflects
 the overwhelming support the Presi-
 dent's policy enjoys with the American
 people. As the Baltimore Sun noted in an
 editorial :

 It is clear that President Johnson can
 look to the future with the knowledge
 that the American people stand solidly
 with him on our Government's policy
 in the dangerous and turbulent Middle
 East area. This fact will give the Presi-
 dent enormous strength and confidence.
 I insert into the RECORD two editorials
 that represent the kind of positive re-
 action that the President has received on
 his enunciation of American policy in
 the Middle East:
 [From the Baltimore (Md.) Sun,
 June 20, 1967]
 THREE SPEECHES
 The state of the world was pretty well set
 forth yesterday in three speeches, one in
 Washington, by President Johnson, and two
 in New York, where Premier Kosygin of the
 Soviet Union and Abba Eban, Foreign Min-
 ister of Israel addressed the General Assem-
 bly of the United Nations. The state of the
 world is not hopeless, but it is not good.
 Specifically as to the Middle East:
 President  Johnson's  statement  of  the
 American position was one that can be sub-
 scribed to by anyone who genuinely wants
 a peaceful Middle East. The points are quite
 clear. As the "first and greatest principle,"
 every nation in the area has a fundamental
 right to live. International maritime rights
 forthcoming.
 [From the Boston (Mass.) Herald,
 June 20, 1967]
 A POSITIVE MIDEAST PROGRAM
 President  Johnson  and  Israeli  Foreign
 Minister Abba Eban, in agreement on several
 points, have offered constructive approaches
 to peace in the Middle East. What Soviet
 Premier Aleksei N. Kosygin has offered is no
 approach at all, but a retreat from peace.
 Besides inflaming the question of who was
 the aggressor, Kosygin's demand that Israel
 withdraw from Arab territory immediately
 and pay full war damages to the Arab na-
 tions would merely set the stage for renewed
 conflict. Kosygin is asking- nothing less than
 a return to the status quo-back to the old
 boundaries, back to the old tensions, back
 to a situation in which the Arabs can rearm.
 In short, back to the conditions that led
 to war in the first place. Kosygin's demands
 are inconsistent with his warning that con-
 flict in the Mideast could lead to nuclear war.
 By contrast, President Johnson, in his five
 principles for peace, recognizes that a key
 need is limiting the "destructive arms race."
 Eban recognies it, too, and further realizes
