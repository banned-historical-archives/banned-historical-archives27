 THE SUEZ SITUATION .     .    .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .     Page  1
 Egypt's Position: President Nasr is maintaining the
 position he adopted at the outset of the Suez crisis.                        He
 sees the principle of Egyptian control of the operations
 of the canal and guarantees of freedom of navigation as
 two distinct issues; he has been unwilling to compromise
 on the first, but is willing to negotiate on the second.
 Despite their public insistence that they are fully
 prepared to defend the country, Egyptian military
 authorities appear privately to be pessmistic about the
 capabilities of their forces.
 British and French Moves: The British and French
 are continuing military preparations in the evident be-
 lief that the meetings between Nasr and the Menzies
 mission may not succeed.  No decision has apparently
 been taken on a plan or date for a joint British-French
 military move against Egypt.
 Soviet Tactics:  The USSR is following a cautious
 course, apparently convinced that time is on Egypt's
 side.  Moscow has been attempting to discourage Western
 military action against Egypt, while not committing the
 USSR to any course of action.

 The French government has apparently concluded
 that it cannot achieve victory over the rebels in
 Algeria this autumn.  Considering the related problem
 of dealing with Nasr of more immediate importance,
 Premier Mollet, in conversations on 8-9 September, will
 urge his minister residing in Algeria, Robert Lacoste,
 to undertake early negotiations with the Algerian rebels,
 a move which reportedly now would receive rightist
 support.

 The Moroccan government crisis apparently has abated,
 and the sultan continues in firm control of the govern-
 ment.           The Moroccan government is wary of becoming
 closely tied with Egypt.  The sultan, nevertheless, has
 indicated that Morocco would join the Arab League.
 GREEK GOVERNMENT DISCOURAGED
 OVER CYPRUS   . .  .  . .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  . . .  .  . .     Page  3
 The position of the Greek government is precarious
 as a result of recent developments concerning Cyprus.
 The surrender ultimatum issued by the British in answer
 to the truce called by the Cypriot guerrillas, and
 Britain's publication of captured documents connecting
 Archbishop Makarios and the late prime minister of
 Greece, Marshal Papagos, with violence on the island
 have contributed to the difficult position of the
 Karamanlis government.
 POLITICAL CRISIS IN JAPAN   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .     Page  3
 The Hatoyama government is undergoing an internal
 struggle over whether to send the prime minister to
 Moscow to seek a compromise on Soviet peace treaty terms.
 The dispute is intensified by political maneuvering
 for control of the governing party in the event of
 Hatoyama's long-expected retirement.  The most likely
 prospect is a cabinet reshuffle, although a party
 split is a possibilit  when the issue comes to a head.

 Laotian prime minister Souvanna Phouma is "most
 disturbed" over the Pathet Lao's frequent violations of
 the cease-fire agreement and its delay in sending repre-
 sentatives to negotiate the detailed form of the final
 settlement.  The Pathets may use stalling tactics to
 extort additional concessions from Souvanna, whose
 political position depends on his ability to reach a
 settlement.  Meanwhile, Souvanna is trying to reduce
 the unfavorable effects on the West of his recent trip
 25X1      to Peiping and Hanoi.

 PEIPING HEDGING
 ON BORDER DISPUTE WITH BURMA .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .     Page 5
 Faced with a resolute Burmese position on the border
 issue, the Chinese Communists have announced they are
 willing to withdraw troops from the disputed territory
 in the Wa States, according to Burmese press reports.
 Peiping proposed, however,!that Burmese troops be with-
 drawn from the disputed boundary in the Kacbin State
 area--a condition which Burma will almost certainly
 reject.  Continued Chinese intransigence may cause
 Rangoon to bring the weight of other neutral nations
 bear on the Chinese for a final settlement.
 INITIAL OPERATIONS
 OF THE TRANS-MONGOLIAN RAILROAD  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .     Page 6
 During the first five months of its operations--
 January through May 1956--the Trans-Mongolian Railroad
 carried 652,000 tons of goods.  At this rate, the line
 would carry about 2,000,000 tons of goods in its first
 year of operation.  This is about one half the esti-
 mated capability of the line and is equal to one third
 the goods moving between the USSR and China.
 BIRTH CONTROL BEING ADVOCATED
 IN COMMUNIST CHINA .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .     Page
 Communist China is the only Sino-Soviet bloc
 country which has permitted an educational and propa-
 ganda campaign to popularize the practice of birth
 control.  The campaign is taking place despite the
 standard Marxist dogma that poverty is attributable
 not to population pressure on the economy but to "pre-
 "
 Socialist
 forms of social organization.
 SOVIET-WEST GERMAN RELATIONS .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
 Controversies over the status of Soviet nationals
 in West Germany and German nationals in the USSR, to-
 gether with the banning of the West German Communist
 Party, have further damaged the already poor relations
 between the two states, but neither government is
 likely to move now to break diplomatic relations.

 WEST GERMANS WEIGH SHIFT
 IN MILITARY DEFENSE STRATEGY .  .  .  .  .  .  .  ..  .  .  .  .  .  . .   Page 10
 A growing dispute over the nature of West Germany's
 new defense forces is likely to come to a head in the
 Bundestag soon after it reconvenes in mid-September.
 Chancellor Adenauer, who deplores signs of a shift in
 Western defense strategy from conventional to nuclear
 weapons, hopes to find support for his view--that
 Allied manpower in West Germany should not be reduced--
 at a meeting of the Ministerial Council of the Western
 European Union scheduled at his request for 15 September
 25X1     in Paris.
 EAST GERMAN LIVING STANDARDS . .  .  .  . . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .     Page 11
 The people of East Germany are increasingly dis-
 satisfied with their standard of living which, though
 higher than that of most of the Satellites, remains
 below the prewar German level.  Despite Soviet economic
 aid to East Germany scheduled for the period 1957-60;
 which is designed to improve living conditions, standards
 as high as those of West Germany almost certainly will
 25X1     not be attained.
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES

 THE FORTHCOMING CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY CONGRESS .  .  .  .     Page  1
 The Chinese Communist Party's 8th Congress, sched-
 uled to open in Peiping on 15 September, is likely to
 start the party moving in the direction of a "collective
 leadership," but Mao will almost certainly continue as
 the dominant figure.  The proceedings at the congress--
 the first since 1945--will throw further light on Mao's
 intentions with regard to his succession, and may re-
 flect the relative strength of Mao's lieutenants in any
 maneuvering following Mao's departure from the scene.
 The congress will elect a new and probably larger central
 committee, hear reports adjusting the party constitution
 to the latest Soviet party statutes, and will be pre-
 sented with an ambitious five-year plan for the period

 SOUTH VIETNAM FEARS NEW COMMUNIST PRESSURE .  . . .  . . . .   Page  5
 The government of South Vietnam is increasingly
 concerned over what President Diem calls the "rampant
 growth of neutralism" in Asia.  In particular, South
 Vietnam fears that the Laotian government's rap-
 prochement with the Pathet Lao will undermine Diem's
 own efforts to resist Communism.  It anticipates re-
 newed Communist efforts to develop international
 pressure for holding unification elections.

 GRANTS UNDER THE SOVIET FOREIGN AID PROGRAM                       Page  7
 The USSR has granted countries outside the Sino-
 Soviet bloc loans and credits totaling at least
 $500,000,000 for economic purposes since launching its
 "trade and aid" campaign early in 1955.  In the same
 period, credits for the purchase of military equipment
 extended indirectly by the USSR to the Middle Eastern
 nations totaled $300,000,000.  In contrast, countries
 belonging to the bloc have received only $100,000,000
 for economic purposes since early 1955, while $500,000,000
 was granted in military credits--all to Communist China.
 From 1946 through 1954, the USSR had advanced $4.7
 billion to Communist-controlled countries for all pur-
 oses  and made no significant loans to other countries.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 6 September 1956
 THE SUEZ SITUATION
 Egypt's Position
 Egypt's President Nasr is
 maintaining the position he
 adopted at the outset of the
 Suez crisis.   He sees the prin-
 ciple of Egyptian control of
 the operations of the canal
 and guarantees of freedom of
 navigation as two distinct is-
 sues; he has been unwilling
 to compromise on the first,
 but is fully willing to nego-
 tiate on the second.
 Cairo and the Middle East
 generally are reported to be
 tense, awaiting the outcome of
 the talks.
 Manifestations of support
 for Nasr continue both in and
 outside Egypt    Rallies on 3
 September in Cairo contributed
 to the tension but remained
 orderly.
 On 4 September, Jordan
 was reported preparing a pro-
 test against British and French
 troop  movements.   Syrian presi-
 dent Quwatli has reaffirmed his
 country's solidarity with Egypt.
 Despite their public in-
 sistence that they are fully
 prepared to defend the country,
 Egyptian military authorities
 appear privately to be very
 pessimistic about the capa-
 bilities of their forces.
 I regu-
 lar army officers have expressed
 a low opinion of the national
 guard, units of which have been
 put in forward positions along
 the beaches near Alexandria.
 A certain air of depres-
 sion among the military may
 have led to Nasr's alleged plan
 to resign his presidential func-
 tions in case his colleagues
 refuse to support him in his
 stand against a compromise of
 what he sees as the basic is-
 sue in the canal dispute.
 .  The canal itself has con-
 tinued to carry about the same
 number of vessels daily as it
 did before nationalization.
 However, discontent among the
 pilots is becoming conspicuous..
 The Egyptian au-
 thorities are believed to be
 more seriously concerned about
 this aspect of the situation
 than any other, since they
 recognize that an interruption
 of the flow of traffic through
 the canal could provide France
 and Britain with an excuse to
 use force.
 The British are continu-
 ing military preparations to

 meet any eventuality in the
 Suez situation in the evident
 belief that the Cairo meetings
 between Nasr and the Menzies
 mission may not succeed. Lon-
 don is apparently proceeding
 on the assumption that its
 demonstrative preparations
 are essential to maintain pres-
 sure on Nasr to come to a set-
 tlement.  Parliament ,has been
 recalled for 12 September.
 According to press reports,
 the reactivation of certain re-
 serve naval units and the move-
 ment of landing craft and mine
 sweepers to the Mediterranean
 is continuing.
 Public opinion in Britain.
 continues divided on the govern-
 ment's policy to date.  The
 American embassy in London be-
 lieves that, while popular sup-
 port for the use of force has
 undoubtedly waned, the Con-
 servative Party "probably solidly
 supports" the government's policy,
 including possible military
 action to assure international
 control of the canal. The power-
 ful Trades Union Congress; how-
 ever, representing some 8,000,000
 trade unionists, in its annual
 conference this week demanded
 that Britain not use force
 against Egypt without the ap-
 proval of the UN.   It was in
 recognition of the state of
 public opinion that the Eden
 government decided to recall
 Parliament.

 coup has become stronger in

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 6 September 1956
 Soviet Tactics
 The USSR is continuing to
 play a cautious role in the
 Suez dispute, apparently still
 convinced that time is on
 Egypt's side.  Moscow probably
 believes its best course is to
 avoid unnecessary entanglement
 in view of what it considers to
 be a possibility of Western
 military action.
 Although Soviet propaganda
 calls the French movement of
 forces to Cyprus an "instru-
 ment of pressure'," Moscow ap-
 prec,iates the seriousness of
 the Suez dispute.   Soviet
 foreign minister Semenov, after
 his return from the London
 conference, told French ambas-
 sador Dejean that if the 18
 powers attempted to impose their
 plan on Nasr, "it would mean
 war."  Foreign Ministry offi-
 cials said that Dejean was un-
 clear as to whether Semenov
 intended the remark to be in-
 Jt?erpreted literally.
 Semenov's statement re-
 flects a further Soviet attempt
 to discourage Western military
 action.against Egypt, without
 committing the USSR to any
 course of action.   While there
 have-been repeated Soviet warn-
 ings to the West about the
 dangers of military action
 against Egypt, these warnings
 have not been accompanied by
 any indications'that the USSR
 intends to intervene directly
 with Soviet forces in the event
 the West does initiate military
 action against Egypt.
 Moscow is demonstrating
 its willingness to give eco-
 nomic and military assistance
 to Egypt.   On 4 September a
 new Soviet-Egyptian wheat agree-
 ment was announced providing
 for 200,000 tons of. Soviet
 wheat in the near future.  This
 would assure Egypt of receiving
 400,000 tons out of some 600,000
 believed needed during the next
 year.
 Soviet shipments of arms
 purchased in 1955 and early 1956
 are still arriving in Alex-
 andria.
 Moscow radio has also
 broadcasted reports that Soviet
 and East German ship pilots are
 already preparing to leave for
 the Suez Canal.
 Nasr's independent line
 might cause Moscow to move
 slower in its involvement at
 this time.   Shepilov's diffi-
 culties in London and the after-
 math of the conference have
 pointed to the Soviet inability
 to influence to an appreciable
 degree the actions of either of
 the chief ants onists.

 consideration of a new status
 for Algeria.
 Despite the indications
 of support from the right and
 right-center for a policy
 change, Mollet still runs a
 risk of clashing with his fel-
 low Socialist, Lacoste, whose
 resignation from the government
 would entail at least a major
 cabinet reshuffle.  Lacoste had
 planned to promulgate broad
 new reforms in about a month,
 but such plans are dependent
 on a setback for Nasr.
 The Moroccan government
 crisis apparently has abated,
 but tensions remain high and
 no action has been initiated
 to lessen basic dissatisfac-
 tions..   The moderate faction of
 the Istiglal party seems to
 have dissuaded the extremist
 faction from pressing for the
 immediate resignation of the
 ten Istiglal cabinet ministers.
 This extremist demand which had
 precipitated the crisis was de-
 signed to force the installation
 of an all-Istiglal cabinet.
 Although the sultan con-
 tinues in firm control of the
 government, some reorientation
 of the cabinet is inevitable if
 the strife between the dominant
 Istiglal party and the small
 Shoura party is. to diminish.
 Replacement of some Shoura and
 independent ministers, possibly
 including Premier Bekkai, by
 Istiglal leaders is likely.
 Meanwhile, Egyptian blan-
 dishmert:s continue. The Egyptian
 ambassador-designate has not
 yet arrived in Rabat, however,
 nor has the sultan yet named
 ,an ambassador to Cairo.  \      I
 Mollet may hope that his
 firmness on the Suez issue will
 gain Lacoste's support for
 early negotiations in Algeria.
 He might argue that it would
 be best to move quickly to
 avoid a prolonged debate.on
 Algerian policy when the Na-
 tional Assembly reconvenes on
 2 October, and that early nego-
 tiations would weaken the
 anticipated renewal of Arab
 criticism of France when the
 UN General Assembly meets in
 November.                             25X1
 Negotiations are under way for
 the establishment of an Egyptian
 cultural center and high school.
 The school is tied in with an
 earlier Egyptian offer of 15
 teachers at practically no cost
 to the Moroccan government and
 50 scholarships for study in
 Cairo.   These negotiations may
 be prolonged, as the Moroccan
 government is wary of becoming
 too closely tied to Egypt.
 No steps are known to have
 been taken with regard to Mo-
 roccan membership in the Arab
 League, but the sultan recently
 told an American correspondent
 that Morocco would join the
 league.  He added that he does
 not consider such membership in
 conflict with his desire for
 close ties with the Western
 world, as he views Morocco
 as a bridge between East and
 West.  Entry into the league
 probably will be postponed un-
 til after the UN General Assem-
 bly approved Morocco's appli-
 cation for membership in the
 United Nations.

 GREEK GOVERNMENT DISCOURAGED
 OVER CYPRUS
 The position of Greek
 prime minister Karamanlis'
 government is becoming pre-
 carious as a result of recent
 developments concerning Cyprus.
 The surrender ultimatum issued
 by the British in answer to
 the truce called by EOKA, the
 Cypriot guerrilla organization,
 dashed the cautious optimism
 that had been developing in
 Athens, and EOKA has resumed
 its campaign of violence on
 the island. Subsequent publica-
 tion in London of captured EOKA
 documents allegedly linking
 exiled Archbishop Makarios
 and the late Greek prime min-
 ister, Papagos, to violence
 on Cyprus have further strength-
 ened the Greek conviction that
 Britain does not desire a set-
 tlement of the issue and seeks
 the overthrow of the Karamanlis
 government.
 At the same time, the
 build-up of British and French
 forces on Cyprus in connection
 with the Suez crisis under-
 scores Britain's claim of the
 island's strategic importance
 to the protection of its
 POLITICAL CRISIS IN JAPAN
 Foreign Minister Shigemit-
 su's return to Tokyo this week
 to report on the deadlocked
 Japan-USSR treaty negotiations
 produced the expected political
 storm,.., and presented the Hato-
 yama government with a serious
 crisis which threatened to split
 the conservative Liberal-Demo-
 cratic Party.
 Negotiations With. USSR
 The debate centered on
 whether to accept the present
 Soviet terms, reject them, or to
 send Prime Minister Hatoyama to
 Moscow. in an attempt to reach a
 compromise solution.  With Some
 elements in the party seeing an
 opportunity to bring about what
 they regard as Hatoyama's long-
 interests in the Middle East
 and suggests a further stiffen-
 ing in London's attitude toward
 the Cypriot claim for self-de-
 termination.  Also, Turkish
 president Bayar recently re-
 iterated Ankara's determined
 opposition to any concession
 to Greek-Cypriot nationalists
 and insisted that the only
 solution to the problem is to
 maintain the status quo.
 The preoccupation of the
 Greek public with the Cyprus is-
 sue has forced the government to
 devote most of its energies and
 resources to that problem, to the
 exclusion of needed economic
 planning and development. Greek
 popular impatience with Kara-
 manlis' moderation in promoting
 Cypriot claims is causing A weak-
 ening of party discipline among
 the prime minister's followers
 in parliament. If the government
 should fall, it would almost cer-
 tainly be succeeded by one sus-
 ceptible to Communist influence
 and inclined to promote the
 Cypriot cause regardless of
 Greece's ties with its Western
 allies.
 overdue retirement, the con-
 troversy has revived deep-
 seated factional rivalries, and
 a struggle for control of the
 government is under way.
 Hatoyama, is still deter-
 mined to make the trip, but is
 apparently supported only by
 his own faction of the party.
 While Hatoyama's opponents fear
 that, in his eagerness to re-
 store relations with the USSR,
 he might accept terms unfavor-
 able to Japan, their major con-
 cern is that he would be suc-
 cessful in effecting a compro-
 mise which could be favorably
 presented to the Japanese pub-
 lic.                                                        This would inevitably en-

 presumably would. accompany the
 weak and ailing premier.
 A majority of the Iconserv-
 atitre :'leaders are _._probably now
 convinced, along with .Shigemitsu,
 that further negotiations with
 the USSR would be futile.
 Some of them are pressing for
 an immediate rupture in the'
 talks, to be followed by Hato-
 yama's resignation, and a re-
 newal of negotiations at some
 future date by the new govern-
 mente
 Others believe that while,

 USSR on the , southern Kuril
 question, a skillful negotiator,
 fortified by the regent.American
 statement which strengthened
 Japan's position on the terri-

 the formula contained in the
 San Francisco treaty which re-
 nounced Japan's sovereignty over
 the Kurils but did not admit to
 Soviet sovereignty, or which sets
 aside  the issue for future
 settlement.
 Power, Struggle
 Hatoyama's proposed trip
 has other implications in the
 power struggle.  The prime min-
 ister has often asserted that
 a restoration of diplomatic
 relations with the USSR, with or
 without a peace, treaty, would
 crown his career, and that he
 would then be willing to retire.

 The various party factions
 also apparently feel that who-

 The inability of the party to

 Hatoyama in power,. although con-

 acknowledged that his weak and
 inept leadership has become a
 political liability.  The prob-

 the political maneuvering.

 The American embassy in
 Vientiane reports that the
 Pathet Lao violations of the
 cease-fire agreement of 5
 August in the two disputed
 provinces of Phong Saly and
 Sam Neua have caused the
 Laotian army chief of staff to
 doubt Pathet "good faith."
 Souvanna, who is worried
 about these skirmishes, has
 "summoned" Souphannouvong to
 come to Vientiane at once with
 his negotiating teams to settle
 the details covering the impo-
 sition of royal  authority over
 the disputed provinces and the
 integration of Pathet forces
 into the :arm .
 Since becoming premier,
 Souvanna's chief objective has
 been to reunite Laos.   To
 achieve this objective he has
 banked heavily on Pathet
 "patriotism," has promised ex-
 tensive concessions to the Com-
 munists, and may be vulnerable
 to pressure to make further
 accommodations.   The Pathets'
 intransigence seems to be aimed
 at extorting a settlement that

 The Chinese proposal ap-

 China a counterweight on the
 Wa States',   Burma's case for the

 less clear-cut.  Peiping appar-
 ently hopes to prolong any ne-
 gotiations in order to postpone
 a choice between abandoning its
 territorial claims and offending
 Burma by demanding cession of
 the disputed areas.
 Burma's Prime Minister Ba

 been forcing Peiping's hand,
 probably would meet any continu-

 create pressure on Communist
 China through the intercession

 Nation called for India and In-

 Burma and an influential Indo-

 In the event that any
 neutral countries intercede with
 Peiping on Burma's behalf,the
 Chinese Communists are likely
 to try to convince them that
 China's claim to the disputed
 areas is at least equally valid.
 They will probably continue to

 Chinese exports
 over the railway con-
 sisted mainly of
 agricultural products
 and industrial raw
 materials, relieving
 traffic over the
 Manchurian line, for-
 merly China's only
 rail link with the

 Chinese imports
 consisted of plant

 petroleum products,

 equipment.
 On the basis of
 freight-carried be-

 the line will carry
 about 2,000,000 tons
 in its first year of
 operation.  This is
 about one half the
 estimated capacity

 one third the volume of goods
 moving between the USSR and
 China.   Specific details of
 grain cargoes reveal that
 freight cars have been lightly
 loaded.  This practice will
 probably continue at least
 through 1956 to prevent major
 damage to the roadbed,, which
 has not yet settled.
 In addition to reducing
 freight costs, the railway pro-

 SOVIET-WEST GERMAN RELATIONS
 Controversies over the
 status of Soviet nationals in
 West Germany and German nation-
 als in the USSR, together with
 the banning of the West German
 Communist Party, have further
 damaged the already poor rela-
 tions between the two states,
 but neither government is likely
 to move now to break diplomatic
 relations.
 Status of Nationals
 In a note delivered on 28
 August, the Soviet government
 denied that the tens of thou-
 sands of Soviet citizens which
 it said were in West Germany
 were actually refugees who de-
 sired to remain. there.   It
 charged that Soviet citizens,
 particularly certain ones who
 have been in prison, were being
 bullied into avoiding contacting
 the Soviet embassy to seek re-
 patriation.   This is the latest
 in a series of recent Soviet
 notes charging that Soviet
 citizens were being held in
 West Germany against their will,.

 similar charges by Bonn con-
 cerning:the treatment of German
 nationals in the USSR.

 their.contracts, on the grounds
 that their interests were being

 bassy.
 The West German government
 has had difficulty in obtaining
 the return of other German na-
 tionals.  The USSR has claimed
 that mafy on the first list of
 1,000 names submitted in March
 have died, have previously been

 Soviet citizens.   This last
 point in particular is likely
 to be a source of continuing

 contends that it has the sole

 recalled as a countermove.   He
 has returned to Moscow following
 talks in Bonn.  Bonn is unlike-
 ly to break diplomatic rela-
 tions with the USSR at this
 time, when the opposition par-
 ties could exploit such a move
 against Adenauer in the'1957
 election campaign.
 The West German Foreign
 Ministry hopes to initiate an
 exchange of ideas on reunifica-
 tion and other questions
 through a note which it has
 let be known would be sent this
 week to the four former occupa-
 tion powers.  The note, ad-
 dressed primarily to the Soviet
 Union, will set forth a hypoth-
 esis for a new move on reunifi-
 cation, which Bonn hopes will
 allay Soviet mistrust of the
 Federal Republic and relieve
 present tension between the
 two countries.
 Reaction to Party Ban
 On 29 August the barrage
 of Orbit propaganda attacking
 the banning of the West German
 Communist Party was climaxed
 by the publication of a state-
 ment of.the central committee
 of the Soviet Communist Party.
 In unusually harsh tones, it
 charged that Bonn was following
 in the footsteps of Hitler and
 that its ''arbitrary and terror-
 istic" actions showed it was
 aiming at a "forced reunifica-
 tion of Germany through a new
 war.."  It said the ban renders
 peaceful reunification impos-
 sible and talk of free elec-
 tions meaningless.  The Bonn
 government called the Soviet
 party statement a "gross inter-
 ference in West German internal
 affairs."
 The American embassy in
 Moscow has pointed out that the
 USSR is particularly sensitive
 to the ban of the West German
 Communist Party because it re-
 flects on Soviet efforts to
 cloak foreign Communist parties
 with respectability.   Moscow
 may expect its statement to off-
 set the effect of the forth-
 coming West German note on uni-
 fication.    In view of the
 widespread criticism of Bonn's
 action by the opposition par-
 ties and by the European press,
 the Soviet leaders probably be-
 lieve their sharp attack will
 help to discredit the Adenauer
 regime, and-;put the blame on it
 for the lack of progress toward
 unification.                         25X1
 WEST GERMANS WEIGH SHIFT
 IN MILITARY DEFENSE STRATEGY
 A growing controversy over
 the nature of West Germany's
 new defense forces is likely
 to come to a head in the
 Bundestag soon-after it recon-
 venes in mid-September.   Chan-
 cellor Adenauer, who deplores.

 defense strategy from conven-

 view,that Allied'mannower in West
 Germany should not be reduced,
 at a meeting.of the Ministerial
 Council of the Western European
 Union scheduled--at Bonn's re-
 quest--for 15 September in Paris.
 Since the meeting was
 called on 25 July, the Germans
 also have become worried over
 the withdrawal of some British
 forces from West Germany as a
 result of the Suez crisis.

 defense forces has gained new
 momentum from an official ar-

 armament is impractical until
 the USSR manifests a genuine
 change in attitude.           He argues
 that the shift of emphasis in.re-
 armament to.atomic weapons would
 be a mistake and lessen the chance
 of avoiding global atomic war,
 Deputy Chairman Mellies
 of the opposition Social Demo-
 cratic Party (SPD) at once re-
 plied that the SPD intended to
 have this subject taken up in
 the Bundestag during the 'debate
 on the length of service for
 draftees.  Mellies attacked. the
 chancellor's views-, saying that
 the Western powers had already
 decided to concentrate on atomic
 weapons.   He claimed Adenauer
 was making a fatal error in be-
 lieving that ,a war in Europe
 could be nonato iic or localized
 and concluded that.the only
 solution for Bonn ,was a small
 army of highly trained techni-
 cians.
 Meanwhile, Bonn officials
 have stated that the Germans'
 main objective at the WEU meet-
 ing will be to reach some agree-
 ment among member countries as
 to the political importance of
 maintaining conventional forces.
 EAST GERMAN LIVING STANDARDS
 The people of East Germany
 are increasingly dissatisfied
 with their standard of living,
 which though higher than that
 of most of the Satellites, re-
 mains below the prewar German
 level.  The Soviet-East German
 agreement of mid-July which is
 to make available 7.5 billion
 rubles (1.8 billion dollars) to
 East Germany for the period
 1957-60, is designed to improve
 living conditions.   However,
 standards as high as those of
 West Germany will almost cer-
 tainly not be attained.
 PART I I
 They fear that reducing Western
 forces in. Europe and placing
 less.stress on conventional
 weapons would leave the West
 dangerously exposed to Soviet
 bloc actions short of all-out
 atomic war.  Chancellor Adenauer
 apparently hopes that any sup-
 port he obtains for this line
 of argument at the WEU meeting
 will strengthen his position for
 the later Bundestag debates and
 help him "sell" the whole pro-
 gram of rearmament and conscrip-
 tion to the public before the
 crucial 1957 federal election.
 Bonn expects considerable
 support from the Benelux
 countries.  The British, how-
 ever,  appear to regard the
 matter of troop cuts in West
 Germany as a question to
 be taken up by NATO, and
 do not see what can be "de-
 cided" at the. WEU meeting.
 There are indications that
 the French, while sharing

 not strongly support the

 During present conditions
 of full employment, when labor
 productivity has been lower
 than planned and overtime work
 has been considerable, the worker
 has accumulated excess purchas-
 ing power.   This has created
 inflationary pressure and stimu-
 lated black markets, to the
 worker's disadvantage.  Pres-
 sure on the worker to increase
 his output, has heightened his
 discontent.   The regime recently
 canceled the application of new
 output norms because of adverse
 worker reaction.
 Housing continues to be
 inadequate, and during the
 severe weather of last winter,
 shortages of coal and electric-
 ity                 caused considerable suf-
 fering and a reduction in in-
 dustrial output.
 In agriculture, there was
 no appreciable increase in out-
 put between 1951 and 1956.   Rea-
 sons include the neglect of agri-
 cultural investment, pressure

 from the regime for farm col-
 lectivization, loss of farmers
 to industry, and defection of
 farm workers to the West.
 The average consumption of
 food, in calories, during 1955-
 56 was lower than in any Satel-
 lite except Albania.  The quality
 of the diet, however, generally
 ranks above that in most Satel-
 lites.  Fats, meat products
 and sugar are strictly rationed
 to ensure that the industrial
 force is favored.   Shortages
 of meat and butter have'apparent-
 ly been more serious than normal
 this summer.
 Agricultural output is
 scheduled to expand only 25 per-
 cent during the Five-Year Plan
 (1956-60) and production of all
 consumer goods only 40 percent.
 Thus, it is virtually certain
 that East Germany will not at-
 tain a standard of living as
 high as that of Vest Germany
 during this period.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 6 September 1956
 The Chinese Communist Par-
 ty's 8th Congress, scheduled
 to open in Peiping on 15 Sep-
 tember, is likely to start the
 party moving in the direction
 of a "collective leadership,"
 but Mao Tse-tung will almost
 certainly continue as the
 dominant figure.  The proceed-
 ings of the congress--the first
 since 1945--will throw further
 light on Mao's intentions with
 regard to his succession, and
 may reflect the relative
 .strength of Mao's lieutenants
 in any maneuvering following
 Mao's departure from the scene.
 The congress will elect a new
 and probably larger central
 committee, hear reports adjust-
 ing the party constitution to
 the latest Soviet party stat-
 utes, and be presented with an
 ambitious five-year plan for
 the period 1958-62.
 The party's 7th Congress
 in 1945, like the Soviet party
 congresses since the 1920's,
 was clearly a rubber-stamp for
 the party leadership, enthu-
 siastically approving its poli-
 cies and electing its choices
 to the central committee. This
 is expected to be essentially
 the case again, although there
 will be an appearance of earnest
 discussion and a mild show of
 "criticism and self-criticism."
 In line with similar develop-
 ments in several bloc countries
 since Stalin's death, such
 criticism was expressed during
 the government's National Peo-
 ple's Congress last June and
 has been encouraged in local
 party congresses in recent
 months.
 Mao Tse-tung probably will
 give the welcoming speech. The
 approximately 1,000 delegates
 then will probably elect a
 temporary presidium and secre-
 tariat to guide the congress.
 The 15-man presidium elected
 at the 1945 congress included
 12 persons who were subsequently
 elected to the politburo.  The
 guiding organs at the forth-
 coming congress, similarly,
 will probably include all mem-
 bers of the politburo which
 will emerge from the congress.
 The Central Committee Report
 If the Chinese follow
 Soviet practice, the report of
 the party central committee,
 the first item on the published
 agenda, will be the major feature
 of the congress, with an elabo-
 rate review of the world situa-
 tion, China's internal position,
 and the condition of the party.
 If this procedure is fol-
 lowed, Mao himself would proba-
 bly make the report, just as
 Khrushchev made the central
 committee report to the Soviet
 party congress in February.
 Mao might delegate the job,
 however, in order to emphasize
 collective leadership and to
 give a fresh indication of his
 choice as to the second-ranking
 man in the collective.  Liu
 Shao-chi has been Mao's top
 lieutenant and his foremost
 spokesman in party affairs
 since 1945, while third-rank-
 ing Chou En-lai has covered
 both foreign and domestic af-
 fairs many times in his periodic
 reports as premier.
 Alternatively, the congress
 may restrict the central commit-
 tee report to a review of party
 affairs and surround it with
 other major addresses, thus in
 effect breaking up a Soviet-
 style report into several com-
 ponents.  For example, Mao
 might make a report outlining
 party policies in the "transi-
 tion to socialism," while sev-
 eral lieutenants might report
 on their areas of responsibil-
 ity.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 6 September 1956
 In any case, the Chinese
 are expected to make the same
 generalities about the world
 situation as Khrushchev did at
 the Soviet party congress, to
 the effect that the Socialist
 camp will triumph in a long-
 term peaceful competition.
 With regard to domestic
 affairs, the central committee
 report is expected to assert
 principally that China remains
 on the "high tide of Socialist
 revolution," that this can be
 completed "in the main," as Mao
 has said, in three years or less,
 and that five-year plan goals
 will be met ahead of schedule
 or surpassed.
 In describing party affairs,
 the central committee report
 is expected to assert that the
 party leadership is faithful
 to Leninism, and that the party
 must lead in opposing "conserva-
 tism" in all phases of the "tran-
 sition to socialism."
 The central committee re-
 port and any other major speeches
 will probably be followed by
 "discussion."  Central and pro-
 vincial party leaders may ex-
 press minor criticisms but are
 expected to give greater atten-
 tion to shortcomings in their
 own spheres of responsibility.
 Revision of Party Constitution
 The next item on the agenda
 is a report on a revision of the
 party's constitution, last re-
 vised in 1945.  The 1945 re-
 port was given by Liu Shao-chi,
 credited with the largest role
 in drafting the constitution
 and generally believed to be the
 principal supervisor of the
 central committee's major de-
 partments.  Liu or one of his
 deputies is expected to make
 the report on constitutional
 revision again.  Liu appears
 to have held on to his position
 in the party hierarchy--second
 only to Mao--despite the em-
 barrassment caused him in 1954
 by Jao Shu-shihr Jao, apparently
 a protege of Liu and director
 of the organization department
 of the central committee, was
 broken for conspiracy with
 politburo member Kao Kang.
 The constitution adopted
 in 1945 was modeled on the
 Soviet party statutes of 1939,
 embodying the basic Leninist
 concepts of party organization--
 centralism, authoritarianism
 and rigid discipline.  As
 usual, however, the Chinese
 Communist Party "adapted" the
 model to Chinese conditions,
 in particular the dominance
 of the party by Mao and the
 party's effort to present its
 program as "new democracy."
 The new constitution will
 probably resemble in many re-
 spects the latest Soviet model
 of 1952.  Of the Chinese fea-
 tures, Mao's personal leader-
 ship will probably no longer
 be emphasized, and the party's
 tasks will be updated to stress
 ,the "transition to socialism."
 Of particular interest is
 the possibility that the number
 of pasts held by the head of
 the party will be reduced.  Mao
 is chairman of the central
 committee, the politburo, and
 the secretariat which directs
 the daily operations of the
 party.   If one or more of his
 posts were eliminated, the party
 would present an appearance of
 greater collective leadership
 and would in fact have taken
 a step toward such a collective.
 The party might at the same time
 provide for a leader of the
 post-Mao collective by creating
 the post of vice chairman under
 whichever chairmanship Mao re-
 tains.
 The constitution may also
 be revised to expand the role
 of the secretariat in organiza-
 tional work, in line with Soviet
 practice.  With the elimination
 of the organization department
 or restriction of its functions,
 the top handful of party leaders
 would get a tighter grip on the

 key function of assigning party
 personnel.
 Other revisions are expect-
 ed to include a stiffening of
 qualifications and procedures
 for party membership, a defini-
 tion of the role of the Central
 Control Committee set up last
 year, and a provision for some
 equivalent of the Soviet party's
 Central Auditing Commission.
 Second Five-Year Plan
 After discussion of the
 report on the party constitu-
 tion,  the directive on the
 Second Five-Year Plan, the third
 agenda item, will be presented.
 The speaker may be, following
 Soviet practice, Premier Chou
 En-lai, but is more likely to
 be one of his two top lieuten-
 ,nts for economic affairs:  Li
 1u-chun, the chief economic
 negotiator with the USSR and
 chairman of the State Planning
 Commission, which has primary
 responsibility for drawing up
 the five-year plans; or Chen
 Yun, the senior vice premier
 and the regime's principal
 spokesman for economic matters
 in general,
 The Second Five-Year Plan
 in many respects will be China's
 first co-ordinated long-term
 plan.   In the period 1953-57,
 officially that of the first
 plan, controls over the economy
 and statistical reporting or-
 ganizations were in process of
 organization, and most of agri-
 culture, food distribution and
 other commerce was in private
 handsand only indirectly sub-
 ject to centralized planning,
 ,Socialization of agriculture,
 industry and trade will probably
 be essentially completed in the
 second plan period.
 Unlike the USSR, Peiping
 has not published a draft of
 the new plan prior to the con-
 gress.  Announcements to date
 have made clear that it will
 emphasize heavy industry, pro-
 vide for increased investment
 in light industry, and call for
 a great increase in agricultural
 output.

 Clues as to specific goals
 may be found in various 12-
 year plans published by the re-
 gime.  These have appeared to be
 early and rough plans--intended
 in party to dramatize Peiping's
 expected successes.  The planned
 increase.in grain output in
 particular seems unrealistic.
 Election of Central Committee
 The final item on the
 agenda is the election of a
 new central committee.  The
 present central committee--
 41 full members and 27 non-
 voting members--has been of
 little importance as a body in
 recent years.  The composition
 of the new membership, never-
 theless, will be significant--
 primarily because it will have
 been decided on beforehand by
 the party's top leaders and
 may reveal their relative
 strengths.
 It seems likely that the
 membership will be roughly
 doubled, to between 120 and 150.
 Most of the 68 present members
 will probably be named again.
 New members will probably in-
 clude leading officials of the
 central committee's central
 departments, government and
 military officials in Peiping,
 ambassadors and leaders of mass
 organizations, first secretaries
 of the party's provincial and
 muncipal committees, and com-
 manders and political commis-
 sars of major military areas
 and operational commands.
 The high levels of the
 party and government in Commu-
 nist China in recent years have
 clearly represented Mao Tse-
 tung's own team.   That is, al-
 most all members of the polit-
 buro and secretariat, and most
 of the top two dozen officials
 of the government (including
 the principal military leaders)
 are known or believed to owe
 their position to Mao more than
 anyone else.  Many of Mao's
 favorites occupy top party and
 government posts concurrently.
 The central committee elec-
 tions and appointments will
 almost certainly continue to
 reflect Mao's domination of the
 party, and will throw further
 light on Mao's preferences as
 to his heirs.
 It is be no means assured
 that Mao'.s arrangements will
 survive him:   some of his lieu-
 tenants may well have plans of
 their own.  Many of them have
 acquired proteges and their
 success in installing their
 personal followers in key party
 positions may have a profound
 effect on the leadership picture
 following Mao's departure from
 the scene.
 Personalities
 Mao's two most powerful
 lieutenants have long seemed
 to be Liu Shao-chi and. Chou
 En-lai.     Other centers of power
 seem to be Peng Te-huai, the
 defense minister, Peng Chen,
 mayor and party boss of Peiping,
 and Kang Sheng,long reported
 as the party's secret police

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 6 September 1956
 Among these lieutenants,
 Liu Shao-chi's hand is expected
 to show most clearly in the
 selection of new central commit-
 ee. members from the committee's
 present apparatus.   In the se-
 lection of new members from per-
 sons.important primarily as
 government officials, Chou En-
 lai's. influence will probably
 be most apparent,.:The'military
 group to be named will probably
 reflect most sharply the rise
 in recent years of.Peng Te-
 huai, who has been surrounding
 himself at the top of the
 military establishment with his
 earlier deputies.
 Few of the party leaders
 outside Peiping can be plausibly,
 aligned with any one of the top
 handful, although some of them
 may have been appointed by
 Liu.    Those elected to the
 central committee will probably
 have had substantial associa-
 tion with the onetime  regional
 leaders. now just below the top
 level of power, such as Teng
 Hsiao-ping,.Lin Piao, Chen I
 Teng Tzu-hui  Li Fu-chun and
 Po I-po.                                25X1
 SOUTH VIETNAM FEARS NEW COMMUNIST PRESSURE
 The government of South
 Vietnam, having achieved a
 measure of internal stability
 and security, is increasingly
 concerned over what President
 Diem calls the "rampant growth
 of neutralism" in Asia, par-
 ticularly in Laos and Cambodia.
 Threat From Laos and Cambodia
 South Vietnam fears that
 the Laotian government's
 rapprochement with the Pathet
 Lao foreshadows an anti-Western
 administration in Laos, which
 would undermine its own efforts
 to resist Communism.   With
 Cambodia already strongly
 neutralist and antagonistic
 toward Saigon, such a  develop-
 ment in Laos would complete
 South Vietnam's physical
 isolation from sympathetic al-
 lies and further expose it to
 Communist encroachment.
 More immediately, the Diem
 government fears that the set-
 tlement in Laos will provide the
 Communists with fresh propaganda
 to revitalize their  long-
 standing, but lagging, campaign
 to develop international pres-
 sure on South Vietnam to accede
 to unification elections.
 Saigon feels that British sup-
 port of, and India's acquiesence
 to, Diem's anti-Geneva stand
 will be adversely affected,
 since both these countries have
 tended to consider that a set-
 tlement in Vietnam would be
 dependent on Communist willing-
 ness to come to terms in Laos.
 Cambodia and Laos, more-
 over, have both recently signed
 joint communiques with bloc
 nations formally endorsing the
 full implementation of the
 Geneva accords in Vietnam,
 whereas previously they had re-
 fused to become involved in
 Vietnamese affairs.  Hanoi radio
 has already noted Saigon's
 concern over developments in
 Laos, and pointedly predicted
 that "the success of the Vien-
 tiane talks has heightened the
 confidence and spirit of struggle
 of the Vietnamese people for the
 peaceful reunification of their
 country."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 6 September 1956
 South-Vietnam's Tactics
 To protect its position
 externally, Saigon has rushed
 an envoy to Laos to counter-
 act the arrival of any Commu-
 nist representation in Vien-
 tiane that seems likely to re-
 sult from Laotian premier
 Souvanna Phouma's visit to
 Peiping and Hanoi.  The.envoy's
 thinly veiled threat to Laotian
 leaders prior to their depar-
 ture for Peiping, however, to
 the effect that Laos' outlets
 through South Vietnam might
 be closed unless Vientiane
 abandoned its neutralism, ap-
 pears only to have irritated
 the Laotians.
 Similarly, the South Viet-
 namese representative in Cam-
 bodia has been instructed to
 "stand and fight it outs" in
 the event Viet Minh diplomats
 show up in Phnom Penh.   In ad-
 dition, Saigon has decided to
 continue its disadvantageous
 trade and payments agreement
 with Cambodia in order not to
 push the Cambodians toward
 closer relations with the
 Communists.
 Saigon is also attempting
 to convince New Delhi that
 Indian interests can best be
 served in Indochina by keeping
 South Vietnam independent.  To
 this end, the influential
 secretary.of state for the
 presidency, Nguyen Huu Chau,
 went to New Delhi with a trade
 delegation for talks    th Prime
 Minister Nehru and other Indian
 officials.  Chau appears to
 have had some success, as he
 has quoted Nehru as saying,
 "The Red Chinese--they must
 not absorb Vietnam," an indica-
 tion that India is becoming
 apprehensive of growing Chinese
 Communist influence in the
 Indochinese peninsula, despite
 its official position that the
 early unification of Vietnam
 would help relax international
 tensions.
 Internal Situation
 Meanwhile, Diem is con-
 tinuing efforts to shore up
 South Vietnam's internal de-
 fenses against Communism.
 Constant military and police
 pressure is being maintained
 on Viet Minh cadres.  Army
 units are also conducting a
 major security sweep to elimi-
 nate all significant Viet Minh
 paramilitary forces in the
 southern part of the country.
 As part of the antisubversive
 program, Dien issued a tough
 antiespionage and treason de-
 cree on 21 August establishing
 the death penalty for any
 Vietnamese taking up arms
 against the state.
 Diem recognizes that al-
 though the danger of overt
 Viet Minh aggression seems to
 have receded for the present,
 he will have'to deal with the
 more subtle long-range problem
 of political and economic sub-
 version.   Spiraling living
 costs, periodic  shortages of
 commodities and labor agitation
 are sources of potentially
 serious unrest. In addition,
 travelers on the highways have
 been subjected to lengthy
 harangues by Communist agents
 concerning the South's impov-
 erishment and lack of hope for
 the future, an indication that
 the Viet Minh is actively ex-
 ploiting economic conditions
 in South Vietnam.
 Diem blames much of the
 recent labor trouble and food
 shortages on corrupt adminis-
 trators.  Accordingly, he has

 measure of stability has come
 to South Vietnam, he intends to
 concentrate on rooting out venal
 elements in the government.
 Stiff punishment has already
 been meted out to high-ranking
 officials convicted in the
 black-market sales of government-
 distributed rice, while the
 "brains" of this swindle--a
 former cabinet member--faces a
 possible death sentence under
 last Octobez's antispeculation
 decree.   Despite the involve-
 ment of high officials, the full
 publicity given these trials
 will probably enhance the gov-
 ernment's prestige.

 trially, if it is to compete
 successfully with North Vietnam
 in the long run.   Efforts for
 a large-scale expansion of the
 South Vietnamese economy, how-
 ever, are still largely in the
 planning stage, although there
 are some signs of progress, such
 as the prospects for a modest
 resumption of rice exports next
 year.   During 1957, the South
 Vietnamese plan to give top at-

 promising quick results for
 large numbers of people, but
 the establishment of certain
 light industries such as tex-
 tile, glassware, sugar and jute
 will also have a high priority.

 FOREIGN AID PROGRAM
 The USSR has granted coun-
 tries outside the Sino-Soviet
 bloc loans and credits totaling
 at least $500,000,000 for eco-
 nomic purposes since launching
 its "trade and'aid" campaign
 early in 1955.   In the same peri-
 od, credits for the purchase of
 military equipment extended in-
 directly by the USSR to the Mid-
 dle Eastern nations totaled
 $300,000,000.   In contrast,
 countries belonging to the bloc
 have received only $100,000,000*
 for economic purposes since
 early 1955, while $500,000,000
 was granted in military credits--
 all to Communist China.   From
 1946 through 1954, the USSR had
 advanced $4.7 billion tc Commu-
 nist controlled countries for all
 purposes, and made nc signifi-
 cant loans to other countries.
 Credits to Sino-Soviet Bloc
 Soviet aid to bloc coun-
 tries since 1946 totals $5.3
 -The USSR has recently of-
 fered economic aid to East Ger-
 many, including a loan of un-
 known amount, but apparently
 less than $250,000,000.
 billion.   Of this, over $2 bil-
 lion has been granted for eco-
 nomic development and for food-
 stuffs and raw materials.   The
 major beneficiaries of this
 part of the program have been
 Poland, East Germany, China,
 North Korea and North Vietnam
 A like amount of Soviet credits
 has been extended for the pur-
 chase of Soviet-owned properties
 in East Germany, Rumania, Hungary,
 Bulgaria and Communist China.
 These so-called "joint stock
 companies" were largely composed
 of Soviet-seized assets of Nazi
 Germany and Japan.
 Military aid, totaling
 $1.2 billion, accounts for the
 remainder of Soviet financial
 assistance to the Sino-Soviet
 bloc since 1946.
 Of the $5.3 billion total,
 only $600,000,000 has been granted
 since January 1955:   Communist
 China received a military credit
 of $500,000,000 for the pur-
 chase of Soviet-held equipment
 and installation in Manchuria,
 and Bulgaria received about
 $100,000,000 worth of economic

 assistance in 1956 to mechanize
 and develop agricultural land.
 In most cases, repayment
 of loans and credits and pay-
 ment of interest charges are
 made in the form of commodities,
 frequently the output of facil-
 ities built with the credits
 granted.   Interest charges on
 loans and credits to the bloc
 range from one to three percent
 with repayment over periods up
 to ten years.
 The Soviet aid arrangements
 have been beneficial to both
 sides.  They enabled the Euro-
 pean Satellites to acquire ur-
 gently. needed grain and raw
 materials in the immediate post-
 war years, and have assisted
 them in the development of a
 vastly expanded industrial
 capacity,
 The USSR, on the other
 hand, increased its control over
 the economies of the Satellites.
 In particular, by specifying
 the commodities to be sent in
 repayment, the USSR has been
 able to some extent to direct
 investment within the bloc.
 Free World Credits
 During the past
 year,         about $500,000-
 000 in Soviet economic
 credits--equal to
 about one quarter of
 the economic develop-
 ment funds the USSR
 granted to bloc coun.-
 tries since 1946--have
 been made available to
 countries outside the
 bloc.   About 95 per-
 cent of this sum went
 to Yugoslavia, India
 and Afghanistan for
 capital goods and
 technical services.
 Interest charges have
 ranged from 2 to 2.5
 percent with repayment
 periods up to 30 years.
 The USSR has expresses
 a willingness to accept commodi-
 ties and local currencies in
 repayment.   In some cases, it
 will receive products from the
 installations to be built with
 Soviet aid.
 Of $200,000,000 in economic
 credits advanced to nonbloc coun-
 tries by the European Satellites,
 90 percent has gone to Yugo-
 slavia.   Token :roans by Czecho-
 slovakia and East Germany have
 been made to Indonesia and Af-
 ghanistan.   A gift of $22,000-
 000 from Communist China to Cam-
 bodia in June was the first out-
 right grant by any bloc nation
 to a non-Communist country.
 On the military side, the
 Soviet bloc since late 1955
 has extended to Middle Eastern
 countries about $300,000,000
 in credits for the purchase
 of arms on extremely attractive
 terms.  These credits are being
 met by shipments of large sur-
 pluses of cotton, for which
 Egypt--the major recipient of
 the arms--could not readily
 find a Western market,
