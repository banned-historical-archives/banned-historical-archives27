Unmask the Forces of War -- Aid the Cause of Peace 
Millions of people all over the world are asking: Is it possible 
to avert war, to avoid the spilling of blood, the destruction of enormous 
material, spiritual and cultural values accumulated by the labor of many 
generations: 
The Soviet Union gives a direct answer to this question: Yes, there 
is sucli a possibility. It is based on the Leninist principle of the 
peaceful coexistence of states with different social and political systems, 
which is the foundation of the foreign policy of the Soviet state. 
The Leninist idea of peaceful coexistence and cooperation between 
states is winning more and more supporters. In the capitalist world it 
is supported not only by the toilers, on whom is laid all the burden of 
war, but also the most sober circles of the national bourgeoisie who 
understand what a mortal danger a new war offers for them. 
The idea of peaceful coexistence is rejected only by the monopo-
listic circles of the U. S. and their allies. In the chase after profit 
which presages new bloody conflicts, these monopolistic circles strive to 
hinder the development of cooperation between peoples, to hinder reduc-
tionpf tension in international relations. Enriching themselves in the 
arms race', they do not even want to hear about banning atomic and other 
types of weapons of mass destruction, about the reduction of armed forces. 
Hatching aggressive plans, the imperialist organizers of bloody 
wars and conflicts count on the peoples not rendering serious resistance 
to. them. But the times when the peoples looked upon war as an inevitable 
evil have vanished eternally. The peoples have acquired enormous politi-
cal experience. They no longer want to make sacrifices for the sake of 
the enrichment of a clique of magnates of capital. 
The movement offighters for peace is placing a mighty obstacle in 
the path of the warmongers. This movement is achieving newer and. newer 
'Victories, is drawing into its ranks millions of peace partisans in all 
countries. 
The unmasking of the aggressive policy of the imperialist powers, 
and above all, the American imperialism, has great significance in this 
struggle. To show the roots of this policy, to reveal its moving forces, 
to show those to whom a war is necessary and who are preparing it -- this 
is the goal which the publishing house placed before itself in publishing 
the present collection.

The facts cited in the book are taken from varied international 
life. All of them were cited in the foreign press. These facts confirm 
the depth of the danger which the aggressive policy of the imperialists 
of the U. S., England, France, and other assistants of American imperial-
ism reprents. The articles, essays, and pamphlets cited show the power 
of the monopolies and their responsibility for the policy of unleashing 
war. 
A number of articles, essays, and pamphlets depict the antipopular 
activity of the most notorious, most typical eervants of monopolistic 
capital. 
The striving of US monopolies to hide their activity from the 
masses, the severe, if unseen, censorship, limits the factual material 
at the disposal of the authors. Many facts are still unknown. But even 
those materials which are cited in the collection make it possible for 
the reader to obtain an answer to the question of Who is against peace, 
Who is preparing a new imperialist war.

"They speak pompous words about a

...December 1952. In one of the most fashionable hotels in New York 
there is being held a regular annual congress of the association of American 
factory and plant owners -- the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM). 
While the delegates of the congress -- solid businessmen -- listen to the 
speeches of the mighty representatives of large-scale monopoly capital of 
the US, or of their proteges, an editorial commission is working out the 
draft of 'orders to the new government Which is to take into its hands the 
reins of state rule in Washington. 
The government of the Republican Party, Which received a majority 
in the eleptions of November 1952, had not yet been formed -- the change 
of. authority did not take place officially until two months after the

presidential elections, but the representatives of the largest groupings 
of monopolistic capital of the United States of America had already been 
placed at the head of the various departments (ministries). 
Neither had American businessmen been at a disadvantage under the 
government of the Democratic Party headed by President Truman. However, 
_ 
in the Truman cabinet, if one does not count Harriman, monopolistic 
capital was represented only through secondary lackies. But now, the 
most .powerful representatives of the American "billionaires' club" had 
come to power. 
At the congress of the National Association of Manufacturers, the 
new cabinet officers made speeches presenting their programs. The congress 
approved the program set forth by them of an arms race, an aggressive 
foreign policy "from positions of strength," of a further attack on the 
working class, and of an intensification of reaction within the country. 
...Opposite the iron fence of the White House in Washington, behind 
narrow Lafayette Square stands a four-story building. A fantastic mixture 
of the ancient Greek style with the modern, a massive balustrade, and 
marble columns give the building a solid appearance. Here is located the 
American Chamber of Commerce (ACC). 
The internal adornment of the building resembles its external appear-
anceg oak panels, marble staircases, broad corridors. On one of the 
upper floors is located a hall with a queer concave ceiling and an in-
genious cornice. At a table resembling two horseshoes meets the Council 
of the Chamber -- representatives of the largest financial, industrial 
and trade. monopolies. Here are decided the important questions of the 
state policy of the US. 
The residence of the Chamber of Commerce is located in the political 
capital of the country, Washington; the headquarters of the National 
Association of Manufacturers is placed in the financial and business capi-
tal of the US, New York. This symbolizes and confirms the fact that the 
NAM and the ACC, these staffs of the imperialist monopolies, occupy ruling 
positions both in the political and in the economic life of the American 
state. The declaration of the NAM that "the Association supports close 
contact with the government in the execution of its measures" ts a reflec-
tion, even if not afull one, of that role Which the National Association 
of Manufacturers plays in the administration of the country. 
The Chamber of Commerce describes its role more openly. "The special 
staff of the Chamber of Commerce In Washington," it says in the report of 
the 001321,94W thq.,9410er to its annual congress, "follows the work of 
Congress closely... The workers of this staff continually keep on the alert 
not only with regard to what is taking place in Congress at the given mo-
ment, but also in regard to everything that can testify to possible Changes..."

The National Association of Manufacturers was created in the period 
when capitalism in the US, as in a number of other countries, was entering 
its higher and final phase, imperialism. The American state, being an 
instrument of the dictatorship of finance capital, began to carry out the 
broad plans of the imperialistic plunderers beyond the borders of the 
country. Powerful monopolistic associations grew up on the basis of un-
restrained exploitation. The lack of rights of the workers spread the 
doctrine of revolution among the proletarian masses, broadened the workers' 
movement. The year preceding the creation of the NAM went down in the 
history of the American labor movement as a period of the high upsurge of 
the class struggle in the United States of America of the nineteenth 
century. 
:In this period of the stormy rise of American imperialism and of the 
growth of the labor movement, 600 of the largest industrialists of the US 
gathered on 22 January 1895 at a conference in the capital of the state 
of OhioxtbeelAy ofCancimati[siel. It was at this conference that the 
National Association of Manufacturers was created. In 1912 the NAM 
organized the American Chamber of Commerce. 
The propaganda of the American monopolies loves to preach about the 
"representative" nature of these two staffs of large capital. Thereby, 
allusion is made to the tact that there are 21,000 concerns, trusts', and 
corporations in the NAM, from the very largest to the very smallest. 
Seventy-five percent of all the workers of the country are employed in 
corporations belonging to the NAM, Which put out up to 80% of industrial 
production. Advertising brochures invariably mention the fact that the 
American_Chamber of Commerce unites 500 trade associations and 2,600 
local Chambers of Commerce, that in it, together with the most important 
executives, there are thousands of small businessmen. 
However, the decisive voice in these two organizations belongs to a 
small clique of the largest magnates of capital. In the NAM and the ' 
American Chamber of Commerce there is the undivided rule of the "billion-
aires1 c1ab" -- the largest concerns and banks of the country, Whose 
capital exceeds billions of'dollars. 
The_organization of the American economists -- the Aosociation for 
Research in. Problems of Labor in the United States -- reckons there to 
be 127 of the largest monopolists within the narrow circle of the ruling 
upper clique of the present day United States of America. People of the 
"billionaires' club" hold directors? posts on the boards of powerful con-
cerns, banks, and insurance companies. To them, indeed, belong the 
ruling posts on the staffs of large capital -- the National Association 
of Manufacturers and the Chamber of Commerce.

The most important executives of American business are represented 
on eighteen committees of the NAM, and in twenty-one "'specialized depart-
ments" and other organs of the Chamber of Commerce. These committees and 
departments were created in accordance with the image and likeness of 
the government and Congress of the US. Among these are committees and 
departments on foreign policy, international political and social prob-
lems, foreign trade, national defense, finances, legislative proposals, 
labor policy, government contracts, budget, taxes, and so forth. There 
are even organs called on to watch over the activity of the go ernment.. 
In the Chamber of Commerce, for example, there is a department for govern. 
ment affairs and for the organization and structure of the government 
apparatus. In the NAM, there exists a special committee on governmental 
expenditures. 
In all these committees and departments, the decisive voice belongs 
to the representatives of the largest monopolies. 
In the Council of Directors of the Association and the Chamber there 
are represented -- through their presidents or vice-presidents -- such 
gigantic concerns, which are the largest in the world, as the military-
industrial and electrotechnical General Electric concern (the Morgans); 
the automobile and military-industrial corporation, General Motors (the 
DuPazts); the oil trust, Standard Oil of New Jersey (the Rockefellers); 
the aluminum monopoly, the Aluminum Company of America (the Mellons)3 
the international atomic-dynamite and chemical trust,Du Pont de Nemours 
(theDuPonts ); the agricultural machinery company, International Har-
vester (a Chicago monopolistic group), and so forth. 
If one takes the NAM committee on foreign policy, then it tarns 
out that, active in it are the representatives of almost all the monopo-
listic plunderers in the category of billionaire corporationsg the Chase 
Manhattan Company Bank (the Rockefellers);Du Pont de Nemours, Standard 
Oil Company of New Jersey, General Motors, that giant of the steel indus-
try, the United States Steel Corporation (the Morgans), the Morgan bank,

Only rarely do scant data penetrate into the American press about 
the still narrower circle of financial bigwigs Who are in control behind 
the scenes of the NAM and the Chamber of Commerce. We have in mind the 
so-oallekspecial consultative committee, to which belongs a small group 
of concerns tied in with the most powerful monopolistic groupings of 
the US. Even in the report of one of the Senate committees (on the activ-

sentatives of the corporations belonging to it met to "select a common 
line of conduct... The majority of the concerns that are members of the

special consultative committee are simultaneously members of the inner 
leading group of the National Association of Manufacturers. They play a 
,guiding role among American industrial giants in the appropriate fields, 
uniting in secret coalition..." 
Robert A. Brady, a Columbia University professor, noted in one of 
his research works that "nowhere is displayed more clearly the ruling 
position of these concerns, the members of the special consultative com-
mittee, than in the National Association of Manufacturers."

The chief managers of business who figure in the capacity of direc-
tors, vice-presidents, and also as members of the majority of the corn

institutions, ruling the roost in the Senate and in the House of Rep-

Secretary of State John Foster Dulles is an extremely important 
jurist of the monopolies and partner in the legal firm of Sullivan and 
Cromwell, vihich serves many of the magnates of American capital and in 
particular, the oil empire of the Rockefeller and the Morgan corpora-
tions. He, indeed, was a director of the International Nickel Company 
and was chairman of the board of the Rockefeller Fund. Representatives 
of the Rockefeller trusts and the Morgan companies are distributed in a 
powerful flock in the Council of Directors and in the majority of the 
other organs of the NAM and the Chamber of Commerce.

Dulles had to admit this openly, when, in January 1957, he explained to 
the members of the Congress why the US was burning with desire to proclaim 
the "Eisenhower Doctrine," that immediate plan of foreign political ex-
pansion intended to hold the countries of the Near and Middle East within 
the system of colonial rale of the imperialist powers. Senator Langer 
permitted himself to ask Dulles about the capital investments of Sullivan 
and Cromwell in the oil industry, about the foreign states where that 
firm has capital, about the concerns which took part in forming the inter-
national oil consortium, and about the role of Dulles?_ deputy, Hoover, in 
this matter. There was nothing left for Dulles to do but acknowledge that 
his "offspring," Sullivan and Cromwell, "perhaps indeed has capital in-
vested in oil." 
The former Secretaryof Defense Charles Wilson came to the Pentagon 
from the post of president of the General Motors concern, representatives 
of which sit in thecommittees and departments of the Association and the

most influential voice in the rale of these two organizations.

both in the Association and in the Chamber of Commerce. 
.Many deputy secretaries, ambassadors, and high ranking Persons in the 
Ministries and the various governmental institutions are connected in one 
degree or another with the National Association of Manufacturers, and the 
Chamber of Commerce. 
Thus, Nelson Rockefeller, son of the oil magnate John Rockefeller --
the actual owner of Standard Oil -- from time to time occupies different 
governmental posts, including such posts as, that of special adviser to

and covert observers at the United' Nations Organization. Representatives 
of the NAM and the Chamber of Commerce were invited by the State Depart-
ment to the conference in San Francisco convened in 1945 to complete the 
preparations for and to sign the charter of the UN. 
The "brain centers" of the American monopolists attentively follow 
the activity of this organization, persistently striving to tarn it into 
a branch of the American State Department. It is they Who, with all their 
strength, are striving to revise the UN charter, trying to undermine its 
most fundamental basis -- the principle of the unanimity of the great 
powers in deciding the most important questions of maintaining peace and 
security throughout the world. In its annual report for 1953, the Chamber 
even emphasized that it was the Chamber which had "laid the basis for a 
study of the problems connected with the UN, for the preparation of American 
proposals for a revision of the charter." 
Control of the monopolies of the NAM and the Chamber of Commerce 
over the legislative organs of the country -- the Senate and the Rouse of 
Representatives -- is no less firm than that over the government. 
This is testified to, above all, by the social makeup of the Congress. 
Thus, according to the estimates of the American press, in the 83rd Congress 
(1952-1954) there were 279 lawyers closely connected with capitalist monopo-
lies (they represent their bosses in courts, and they also represent them 
in Congress), 138 businessmen, 37 professional politicians, 18 journalists, 
18 landowners, 8 military men, and 33 other persons. In the last two 
Congresses, as before, businessmen and lawyers of large-scale business 
predominate. In them there has not been and there is not a single worker 
or a single toiling farmer. 
It is such a makeup of Congress which permits the Chamber of Commerce 
to declare, like something self-evident, that "for the adoption of laws... 
Congress needs the arrangements and recommendations of business.... The 
Chamber of Commerce informs Congress of its point of view by two means; 
by sending directly to Congress the recommendations of business about bills; 
and by advising business people in localities to influence, with their ideas, 
Congressmen representing their election districts." 
Besides the open henchmen of the Association and the Chamber, numerous 
"lobbyists" act in Congress -- special agents of capitalist monopolies 
striving for the adoption or defeat in Congress of one bill or another by 
means of Corridor deals and bribes, and by winning over those Congressmen 
who are not directly in the service of the monopolies or Who, indeed, per-
mit themselves to play at democracy. The American journalists Allen and 
Shannon write that "the scope of the lobbies, their influence, capacity 
to do evil, greed, machinations, deceit, and falsification have reached 
such a scale...that they threaten the government itself." The Most power-
ful, naturally, are the "lobbies" of the National Association of Manufac-
turers and the Chamber of Commerce.

The existence and activity_of the National Association of Manufac-
turersand the Chamber of Commerce -- the staffs of US, large finance 
capital -- does not mean, of course, a weakening of the extremely sharp 
etruggle among the monopolists. On the contrary, the struggle among them 
for sources of raw materials and markets, for spheres of influence, for 
power in the country, for pr fitable governmental orders -- above all, 
military orders for .in and profit, is becoming ever more persistent 
and merciless, In all this, in these conflicts, robbers take part, Whose 
loot is.reckoned-not by the hundreds of thousands and millions, but by the 
hundreds of millions and billions of dollars. 
Anexa4ple of each a struggle is the fight for the largest trans-
portation arteries of the country, which has developed in recent years 
between, the magnates of the Middle West (Chicago and Cleveland monopolistic 
groups) and an association of financiers representing the power and in-
fluence of Wall Street. As a result of this struggle, the Cleveland rail-
road king Robert Young, having formed an alliance with a number of monopo-
lists.of the 1444le West and "nouveau riche" millionaires from the state 
of Texas in 1954, tore away from the Morgans the New York Central System, 
the, second railroad in size in the 7L whose assets exceed 2.5 billion 
dollars, and established his control over it. 
Discussing the ins and outs of this struggle, one of the most well 
informed.US press organs, the newspaper The New York Times, wrote that 
"a_financia1 wax has broken out on a scale such as has rarely been observed 
in this century.... On the horizon, conflicts are drawing near, in comparison

with Which the fight for the New York Central system possibly will seem 
only a duel with pistols. The financial and industrial capital of the 
Middle West..., apparently, is testing its strength for a decisive con-
flict with the eastern groups..." 
In the bitter struggle with the other groupings of Wall Street, the 
Rockefeller Masse National Bank in January 1955 &allowed up the Bank of 
Manhattan Company, which had been controlled by the Kuhn-Loeb family. 
Having gained Control of the assets of this bank, the Rockefellers turned 
their bank, now under the name of the Chase Manhattan Company, into one 
of the largest banks of the capitalist world. 
Throughout the period 1954-1957, even experienced American observers 
were perplexed by a series of "mergers", "absorptions", and failures in 
the competitive struggle of the largest enterprises of the country in all 
branches of industry and spheres of economic and financial activity. In 
January 1957, the magazines kVA and Look destroyed their long-standing 
competitor, the magazine Colliers. They thus compelled one of the oldest 
American magazines, with a circulation of 4.5 million copies, to cease 
existence. The magazine IAA inherited all of Colliers business, and, 
of course, its subscribers. 
The unrestrained struggle of the magnates of large capital for power 
in the country finds its reflection also in their striving to strengthen 
their influence in the two main coordinating centers of the monopolies 
the National Association of Manufacturers and the Chamber of Commerce. 
The distribution of forces of the monopolies within these organizations 
and the influence in them dependi on those positions which the monopolies 
occupy in the economy of the country. The Association and the Chamber of 
Commerce are cartels of a certain type, roles in which are distributed 
In conformity with the real balance of forces. inasmuch as all the monopo-
lies are striving to change this balance to their own advantage, the role 
of one monopolistic group or another in the HAM and the Chamber of Commerce 
does not remain. unchanged. 
With every year, imperialist contradictions become more and more pro-
found, and intensify the competitive battle for the expansion of the sphere 
of monopolistic rule, for the conquest of ruling positions in the economic 
and political life of the country. But in such questions of foreign and 
domestic policy as the militarization of the economy, preparation for war, 
opposition to peace-loving forces and to democracy throughout the world, 
as well as to the labor movement within the US -- in all these extremely 
important questions the various groupings of monopolistic capital act 
with closed ranks. They dictate their reactionary, aggressive policy 
to the upper Cliques of both main bourgeois parties of the US -- the 
Republican and Democratic parties. Congress acts according to their in-
structions. Satisfaction of their interests is the law for the apparatus 
of state administration of the country.

If 0.210u takes the constitution (by-laws) of the National Association 
offrianufacturers, which is often dhanged and amended in conformity with 
the demands of the moment, we see that in one of its variants, adopted in 
1950, there Is inscribed the following official goale of this organiza-
tion; "Securing the indaetrial apd financial interests of the USA"; 
joint action for the development of foreign trade"; "securing the interests 
of capital in its struggle against the labor movement"; the struggle. for 
the preservation of the foundations of private property"; "propaganda of 
ideasTAnd,dissemination of information" having as their purpose the 
defense of the interests of American imperialism; "support of legislative 
acts" aimed at carrying out these purposes, and "checking upon. their im 
plementation by the state apparatus." 
However, the activity of the NAM and the Chamber of Commerce goes 
far beyond the bounds of even these officially proclaimed-programmatic 
provisions... Both staffs of American monopolistic capital keep under their 
unsleckening observation all sides of the activity of the present-day Amer-
ican state. 
From the 'very first days of the existence of the NAM and the Chamber 
of Commerce, their activity had an imperialist character. They displayed 
exceptional activity in working out and executing numerous expansionist 
"programs" and "plans" which so persistently bind the United States of 
America to. the other countries of the capitalist world. 
Yithin_thehsart of the Association and the Chamber were worked out 
_ . 
the "Truman Doctrine," the "Marshall Plan," the program for rendering 
"aid" to the so-called underdeveloped countries, and the "Eisenhower 
Doctrine". ,For example, it is. pointed. out, in the programmatic document 
of the Chamber of Commerce devoted to setting forth its "position in 
questions of world policy," that the Chamber had Approved the "Truman 
Doctrine", 7- that plan for military and economic seizure of new territories 
and colonies in the eastern portion of the Mediterranean Sea -- even before 
it "became an object of examination by both houses of Congress." 
As far as the "Marshall Plan" is concerned, the NAM has boasted that 
it was the "first organization in the US which Wholly supported the crea-
tion and principles of action of the Economic Cooperation Administration: 
many recommendations advanced by the NAM were made the basis of the activity 
of this Administration; and people were supplied by the Association for 
leading posts." The Chamber of Commerce published a statement which set 
forth the goals and tasks?. methods and means of carrying out this "aid." 
In 1952, the Chamber noted that "Congress has used many of its principles 
in legislative activity on the given question."

The "Eisenhower Doctrine," that child, of the imperialist policy of 
the US, is just such a product of the activity of the Chamber and the 
Association as the rest of the "doctrines," "plans" and "programs" kindred 
to it. Eisenhower, the President'of the country, presented his doctrine 
to the Congress on 5 January 1957. But prior to him-, clear demands on 
this question had been noisily formulated by two other presidents who 
were no less influential: Henry Alexander, president of the J. P. Morgan 
and Company, and. Rathbone, the president of the Standard Oil Company of 
New Jersey. These are the heads of two concerns playing "first fiddle" 
in the NAM and the Chamber. On 7 December 1956, that is, almost a month 
before the official proclamation of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," Alexander, 
speaking in Chicago at a meeting of businessmen who were leaders of enter-
prises, demanded that the government carry out a more decisive policy 
in the Near and Middle East, and defined the bases of this "doctrine." 
"We cannot," he declared, "disavow what is our own...An American doctrine 
Is necessary for the Near and Middle East, precisely in the same way that 
there exists an American doctrine for Greece and Turkey and an American 
doctrine for Formosa (that is Taiwan -- D. A.), Quemoy and Matsu." Within 
a short time, Rathbone spoke before the Chamber of Commerce of the state 
of Oklahoma, giving advice -- sounding like an order -- to carry out a 
"firm policy" in the Arab East: "The United States should exercise 
leadership for the restoration of peace and stability in this region... 
This, without doubt, is a problem from which we shall not be able to 
separate ourselves easily... We shall go forWard prudently and decisively..." 
The activity of the NAM and the Chamber of Commerce, the speeches of these 
two presidents, the adoption by the government and the Congress of the 
course proposed by the monopolies, pre-determined the adoption of the 
"Eisenhower Doctrine." The USA took one more adventuristic step in its 
irrational and dangerous game directed at establishing its world rule. 
One day the ruling circles of the US felt the need of carrying out 
a special check on the states receiving American "aid." The goal of the 
check was to establish whether the "aid" rendered these countries answers 
the interests of American capital sufficiently. A group of 55 employers 
and financiers -- in essence fully controlled by the NAM and the Chamber 
of Commerce -- was designated to carry out the check. At the head Of the 
group of investigators was placed the chairman of the board of directors 
of Morgan's General Foods Corporation. As it turned out, the represents, 
tive of this "General Foods," C. M. Chester, is honorary vice-president 
of the Association. The sub-group for checking England was headed by 
Henning Prentis, honorary vice-president of the NAM and head of a number 
of departments of the Chamber of Commerce. The sub-group for checking 
France was led by Joseph Spang, vice-president of the NAM. At the head of 
the group of investigators in Italy was placed Frederick Crawford, an hon-
orary vice-president of the National Association of Manufacturers.

In recent years, a number of conferences of magnates of large capital 
have been held by the association and the chamber for the purpose of 
strengthening the positions of American capital in the world market. One 
of these meetings was the attentively prepared conference of industrialists 
of the USA and the countries of Western Europe, held in Paris in 1954. The 
decisions of this conference were not published. But even the reactionary 
press admitted that the basic purpose of this gathering of imperialists 
was "the strengthening of the struggle against the USSR." 
In February 1955, in New Orleans, at the initiative of the associa-
tion and chamber, and with the assistance of the American ruling circles, 
a convocation of industrialists of Western hemisphere countries was held. 
Four hundred. representatives of the comprador bourgeoisie of the Latin 
American countries met with .400 of the largest American businessmen. The 
tasks of this convocation included the creation, for the monopolists of 
the USA, of still more favorable conditions for the investment of their 
capital in the countries of Latin America. 
In 1957, the second such convocation of leaders of industrial and 
financial capital of the countries of the American continent was held 
in Caracas.

The Second World Wer was a genuine orgy of profit for the American 
monopolists. From June 1940 through September 1944 the value of the 
fundamental military orders issued by the American government to the 
monopolists amounted to 175 billion dollars. One hundred of the largest 
concerns received 117 billion dollars in military orders. The profits of 
these concerns rose 370 percent by 1944, in comparison with 1939. 
During the period of the war, the businessmen of the monopolies, the 
NAM, and. the Chamber of Commerce seized all the key positions in the state 
apparatus, They dictated conditions. 
In the fall of 1942, representatives of one of the leading organs 
of the National Association of Manufacturers gathered at the Pennsylvania 
Rotel in New York to work out their program. Lammot Du Pontl,a vice-
president of the NAM, made a speech. "Toward the government and toward 
all squawkers," he said, we must conduct ourselves as we do toward buyers 
of goods in short supply. We dictate the prices. They need our goods. 
Fine; Let them pay in flail" 
The well-known liberal American journalist William Allen White 
ironically noted that the representatives of the monopolies, having im-
planted themselves in the state apparatus of the USA, had the firm inten-
tion of "profiting by this war for their own benefit," at any price.

The arms were stacked. The peoples who had borne upon their Shoulders 
all the misfortunes of war demanded the establishment of a firm, lasting 
peace. But how did the Imperialist monopolies, the NAM, the Chamber of 
Commerce behave toward this great and important task? 
As early as November 1945, the Association and the Chamber convened 
a meeting of pe, magnates of American finance capital, in order to work 
out a common line among the US monopolies on opestions of foreign and 
domestic policy. Among those who took part in the conference, which was 
held in strict secrecy in the small town of Absecon, were W. Aldrich, 
president of Rockefeller?s Chase National Bank, LammottuIbnt and J. 
Dupont from the Eurbnt do Nemours concern, the leaders of such monopolies 
as General Motors, General Electric, and others. The result of the con-
ference was the proclamation of a "tough policy" and the beginning of the 
"cold war" against the USSR. 
This directive of the meeting was carried out precisely by the Truman 
government. At the annual congress of the NAM in 1945, [RobertR.1 Was on, 
its president at that time, proclaimed the imperialist doctrine of the 
"American era": "The United States has become a leading world power," he 
declared. "The 20th century is the century of America." Right after this, 
Truman, the President of the country, officially declared the US's pre-
tension to "leadership of the world." 
The entire postwar policy of the ruling circles of the US has con-
slated of attempts to put this aggressive doctrine into effect. In the 
execution of the course laid down by the EAR and the Chamber of Commerce, 
laws were approved and principles of policy were declared which placed 
the peoples of the entire world under a threat to their peace and security; 
the forces of international imperialist reaction were consolidated against 
the countries of the socialist camp. 
400n after the start of the war in Korea, the NAM and. the Chamber 
of Commerce proposed to the government to demand of its allies in the 
Atlantic Bloc an intensification of the arms race, a reorganization of 
their armed forces. This course was planned in documents of the Associa-
tion and the Chamber adopted as early as July 1950. The official organ 
of the Association, The 1AM News, emphasized that "as a result of the 
events in the Par East, the basic buttress to the foreign policy of the 
US has been transferred from economic pressure to the use of armed force. 
We should decisively re-examine our plan, and hasten to the maximum the 
rearming of the countries of the Atlantic Bloc ... Now the buttress is 
being formed in the creation of armed forces..." 
Soon afterward, resolutions of the Council of Directors of the NAM 
and the Chamber of Commerce appeared, in which it was cynically pointed 
out; "The West European countries should make heavy sacrifices in the 
interest of the creation of armed forces... The American government 
should receive firm assurances from these countries with regard to the 
effective mobilization by them of popular and materiel resources."

'This was the policy of the unleashing of local wars and the prepara-
tion of a "large" third world War. 
The enthusiasm with Which the executives of the NAM and the Chamber 
of Commerce welcomed the war in Korea is understandable. The total sum 
of allocations for the production of arms and for military construction 
during the two and one-half years of the war in Korea reached, according 
to the official data of theDepartammtof Defense, 169.7 billion dollars. 
This was almost equal to the cost of the basic military orders in the US 
daring the Second World War. As a result, the profits of the cannon 
kings and, concerns working for the war rose sharply. The profits of the 
US monopolies daring the war reached 118 billion dollars. 
The NAM, together with the D6p9drtniembof Defense, informed the monopo-
lies in detail how and by what means government orders would be granted. 
"In order not to create chaos in Washington," the NAM prepared special 
drafts regulating the order and sequence of the issuance of contracts. 
Immediately after the beginning of military operations a meeting was 
held between the leaders of the Association and members of the government. 
Putnam, president of the Association, sent President Truman a telegram 
which revealed with cynical frankness the NAM9s readiness to work even 
further together with the government toward the unleashing of a general 
armed cOnflicts "American industry with its productive might publicly 
assumes the obligation of fully satisfying the needs of the United States 
and its allies"... If Korea leads to a general war...American industry is 
ready for this, too." 
Making ,profit out of the war in Korea, the American monopolies 
hindered its ending in every way. In a special memorandum of the NAM 
sent to the government, it was pointed out that the war in Korea had 
deferred .a sharp economic crisis on whose threshold the US had been in 
1950. The cessation of military operations and removal of American 
troops from Korea, it was pointed out in this memorandum, would have "a 
pernicious influence" on the economy of the USA. In December 1950, Putnam, 
the president of the NAM, declared in the name of the NAM8s members that 
the condition of the US economy depended on how long military operations 
would continue in Korea and Viet Nam, and how much longer government 
military expenditures would be made. 
The magnates of American finance capital, the NAM and the Chamber 
of Commerce, used the Korea War as a pretext to shunt the economy of the 
US onto military rails. A military economy became the source of further 
enrichment for the directors of monopolistic capital, and a necessary 
condition for the receipt of the maximum possible profits. The arms race 
in the US took on a scope unprecedented in history. In the ten years 
following the completion of the. Second World War (from 1946 - 1955), direct 
military expenditures of the US reached astronomical figures -- 303 billion 
dollars. This exceeds the entire "gross national product" of the country

for 1954. The state apparatus of the USA was converted into a gigantic 
press, squeezing enormous taxes out of the workers. These funds were 
sent into the safes of the largest monopolies In the form of payments 
for military orders and as various sorts of subsidies. At the present 
time military production constitutes about 20 percent of the entire value 
of US industrial production. That is why the National Association of 
Manufacturers and the hamber of Commerce are trying to tarn the arms 
race and the "cold war" policy into a permanent factor. 
In the declaration "on the policy of the Chamber of Commerce," 
adopted at its congress in 1954, it is said that, in planning their 
policy and their expenditures, the ruling circles dhould base themselves 
on the fact that "the existing state of tension throughout the world will 
continue indefinitely." In this same declaration, the Chamber approvingly 
pats the government circles on the back for the policy conducted by them 
of "creating strong offensive and defensive armed forces, calculated for 
undetermined periods of time." In the interests of the execution of this 
policy the congress of the Chamber adopted a series of resolutions -- on 
the principles of mobilization of the economy, on the number of men in 
the armed forces, and so forth. 
The decisions of the congress on questions of foreign policy touch 
on all aspects of the official political course maintained by the American 
ruling circles. Here are "the merciless struggle against communism," 
the blockade of the People's Republic of China, the organization of sub-
versive activity in the countries of the democratic camp, the embargo on 
trade with the USSR and the plans of rearming West Germany. It is in-
structive that US Vice,President Nixon, the earrentSecretauof Defense 
Wilson, and other state leaders made speeches at the congress. Wilson 
devoted hiss?peeCh to a description of the "new military policy of the US." 
He assured the Chamber that; the ruling circles were ready to give that 
policy an even more bellicose character in. .the event of "critical" events 
in Europe and Asia. 
* * * 
While working out and dictating a policy to the American state --
a policy completely alien to the interests of the common people of America 
the National Association of Manufacturers and the Chamber of Commerce 
simultaneously carry out furious propaganda, striving to exercise the in-
fluence necessary to them on public opinion in the country. Hundreds of 
transmitters broadcast and televise special programs prepared by the NAM 
and the Chamber. They distribute millions of books, brochures, pamphlets, 
and informational materials; they create special films, and organize 
numerous conferences, meetings, and gatherings. The NAM alone supplies 
"guidance information to 20700 leading journalists, Washington capitol 
correspondents, and columnists. News, cartoons and other materials are 
sent out free to 5,540 newspapers and journals. The NAM daily spends one

million dollars in order to Compel tbe American people to believe a direct 
lie -- to believe that the imperialist monopolies are the "benefactors' 
of the US. A significant portion:otthe funds allocated by the EAM to 
educational institutions is designed to form the consciousness of youth 
in a spirit beneficial to the forces of reaction. 
The Chamber of Commerce also conducts advertising and. propaganda 
activity on the same enormous scale. It publishes about 20 press organs, 
including the monthly journal N? whOse circulation is 
800,000 copies. The press service of the Chamber serves 1,400 daily said. 
more than a thousand weekly US newspapers. Just as the NAM does, the 
Chamber of Commerce provides journalists .and radio commentators with 
"guidance" information. 
.111ekindling of enmity for the Soviet Union and for the people's 
democracies is a common note in all the propaganda of the association and 
the Chamber. Day after day, the thought is instilled in readers that the 
arms race ts "neceseary," that war is supposedly inevitable, and peaceful 
coexistence 0 countries and peoples allegedly impossible. "There ,can 
be to compromise Whatever between the USSR and the USA," asserts the NAM 
in one of J4e144meraus brochures. "We stand for a pitiless struggle, 
against communism," ,reads a declaration of a recent congress of the 
Chamber of Commerce, And in his report to the 61st Congress of the NAM 
held iniPecember 1956, -- Parker, a former president of the Association,. 
called. for re-examination of the question of breaking off diplomatic rela-
tions between the USA and the USSR. The striving to_blacken:the Soviet 
Union drives the leaders of the EAR and the Chamber of Commerce to the 
wildest fabrications and slanders. 
T.. 
A Senate Committee which carried out an investigation of the 
activity of the Association in 1940 was obliged literally, tO declare 
the following:- "The National Association of Manufacturers has deluged: 
the country with anonymous propaganda for the purpose of disorienting and 
deceiving public opinion.... That propaganda, Whose origin Within tho-EIM 
is almost completely hidden from public opinion, is persistently displayed 
from day to day with the aid of all means of press, radio, schools, 
lectures, and so forth... The NAM contrives to carry on its propaganda 
through subsidiary organizations, in order to disorient public opinion 
and to :convince it that this propaganda eminates from independent sources.: 
The leaders of the Association boast that their propagandaAnfluences the - 
political views of millions of citizens and their choice of candidates 
for etateposts." 
The. unbridled, aad open, or subtle and hidden -- depending On circiat-
stancea propaganda carried on by the EAM and the Chamber of Commerce 
represents a complex of ideas and principles, the operative goal of which 
is to corrupt the consciousness of the ordinary American, to subordinate 
him to the interests of the riling groups, to poison him with the preaching

of "class harmony," with the chauvinistic venom of "Americanism," with 
hatred, for the ideas of socialism and. toward the countries which are 
putting these ideas into effect. All actual class relations are made con-
fused, Profit is proclaimed the highest meaning of human existence. The 
close ties between the Association and the Chamber with the press, radio, 
information agencies, and publishing concerns make the scope of this propa-
ganda flooding the American people indeed ominous. 
Many of the executives of the leading organs of press and radio and 
publishing concerns are members of committees of the Association and of 
departments of the Chamber. Some of them have fought their way up to the 
higher leading posts. Walter Fuller, chairman of the board of directors 
of the Curtis Publishing Company, which issues the magazine Saturday  
Evening Post, known for its extremely reactionary nature, has been a 
president of the NAM. Fuller is now an honorary vice president of the 
Association. One of the directors of the Chamber of Commerce and leader 
of its department of foreign trade is Arthur Motley, vice president of the 
Crowell-Collier Publishing Company, a large publishing concern. A vice 
president of the NAM committee for foreign policy questions is James 
McGraw, one of the owners of the McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, and of 
the journal Business Week. [Charles] Douglas, publisher of the journal 
Fortune, who for a long time was President Eisenhower's assistance for 
the planning of the "cold war," also is a member of this committee. In 
the various departments of the Chamber of Commerce one can find the pub-
lishers of each journals and newspapers as Look, Readers Digest, The 
Christian_n_vloitor, and many others. 
At the NAM Congress in December 1956, together with other plans of 
political activity of the monopolies, there was approved the new, grandiose 
program for the intensification of propaganda set forth in the report of 
the Managing Director of the NAM, Kenneth Miller. Addressing the delegates 
of the congress, he stated literally the following: "Our task consists in 
obtaining the loyalty and good-will of the American people, their faith 
in the leadership of manufacturers... In conformity with our program 
of influencing the public, we constantly maintain working contact with 
the press, radio, and. television, with magazines distributed throughout 
the country, with economic newspapers, and with all the other organs of 
the printed word. Week after week and month after month the number of 
pages depicting the goals and intentions of industry is becoming more and 
more imposing... We penetrate clubs and military organizations. With 
the aid of our educational and training programs, we act in closer and 
closer cooperation with schools and colleges. Our departments for work 
among women not only maintain close ties with women's organizations and 
groups, but also cover women in everyday life through the publication of 
materials which interest them in magazines and newspapers, as well as in 
radio and television broadcasts.

"By making use of our program for ties between industry and the church, 
we bring acquaintance with the affairs of industry to the dhurdh -goers, 
whose interest in economic matters and in the factors leading to economic 
progress has been rapidly growing in recent years.

of 'success in our work of influencing the Ameriean People, using for this 
purpose every channel and every Means leading to the masses. However, 
the only way that all this expanded activity can be successful Is for 
businessmen to take part in the battle for the Minds of people everywhere 
they live and act. That battle must be carried on constantly, not only 
with the aid of money, but also on a still greater scale devoting 
personal time and attention to It.

What the NAM and the Chamber of Commerce are striving for within 
their, country, what policy they are following with regard to the American 
workers, can be 80031 especially vividly from the activity of these organiza, 
tions_d4ring the economic crises of the 1930s, daring the Second World 
Wax, and especially in the postwar period. 
When:the 000nomic crisis was raging in the USA in 1929 to 1933 and 
the revolutionary movement was expanding, plans were being prepared within 
thejte4r:cf, tbe NAM and the Chamber for establishing a fascist dictator... 
ship within the USA in the image and likeness of Nazi Germany. 
The fact that such plans were seriously being prepared is testified 
to by the evidence Which General Smedley Butler gave at one time to the 
committeeothe US Congress known under the name of the MacCormack, 
Dickstetn Committee. The GeneralreIatadthat Gerald JeretulahDe suet?] Maguire, 6. 
certain banker ar theMprgaa grpuRtriedto persuade him to become the head of

dictatorship in the US. The organizers of this black adventure proposed 
to create a fascist army of 500,000 soldiers. It was planned to obtain 
arms for the army from the Du Font armaments firm, the Remington Arms 
Company. Mavire spoke in the name of the fascist organization "The 
League of Preedom, enjoying the support of the largest magnates of 
capital. 
1938, that is, in the period When the USA was falling intt a new 
econozto crisis, and into the period of intensive preparation by the im-
perialist powers for the unleashing of the Second World War, the Chamber 
of :Commerce convened a meeting of 200 of the largest industrialists. At 
this meeting, H. Prentis, head of the Armstrong Cork Company Who was 
one of the directors of the NAM and the Chamber of Commerce, and Who was 
subsequently president and honorary vide-president of the NAM, declared 
to those gathered that the necessity of resorting to "some form of hidden 
dictatorship..." was rising before the employers.

About a year before Munich, on 23 November 1937 -- that is, soon 
after the meeting at which Hitler acquainted his military chiefs with the 
plans for aggression against Austria and Czechoslovakia (the genuine 
record of this meeting was furnished to the Nurenburg tribunal which tried 
the chief Nazi criminals) -- there took place in the USA a secret meeting 
of representatives of American "big business" and German fascism. "Big 
business" was represented by several eminent leaders of the NAM, including 
Lammot DuPont, former president of General Motors and one of the chief 
executives of the Association. At this meeting, which was described in 
detail in the $0 August 1942 reports of Congress, representatives of the 
American monopolists and the German fascists Von Killinger, German 
Gonsul,General in San Francisco, and Tlppelkitch,, Consul General in 
Boston, disaassed the question of joint activity directed against the 
USSR, the question of the division of spheres of influence in the world, 
and of the possibility of applying German-fascist methods in the internal 
affairs of the USA. 
In 1939, the Second World War, fostered by international imperialist 
reaction, broke out, Within two years, the USA was obliged to become 
one of its direct participants. And immediately, the groups of maganates 
of capital ruling within the USA, fearing the consequences of the war on 
internal political life, and recalling with fright the sharp strengthening 
of the labor movement within the country after the end of World War I, 
planned an unbridled program for curbing the labor movement. That program 
was worked out by Lammot DuPont, vice president of the National Associa-
tion of Manufacturers, and adopted in 1942 at a closed session of the 
committee on resolutions. 
.As soon as the war ended, the program of struggle against the labor 
movement was developed further. Broad measures began to be carried out 
toubring order" into the state apparatus, Congress, the trade unions, and 
into the personal and public life of the common American people. 
Within the very shortest period, all those who had more or less 
soberly Judged existing international conditions, and the paths of 
development of Soviet-American relations in particular, all those who 
appealed for caution in the execution of foreign policy, were expelled 
from the government of President Truman, that "provincial politician . 
from the state of Missouri," as American journalists christened him. 
Assiduous preparation was began for the elections to the 80th Congress, 
as a result of 14hich a legislative organ was elected in 1946, which was 
called "a Congress of Businessmen." This congress was literally flooded 
with bills directed. against the workers. Hundreds of anti-labor bills, 
one after another, were advanced for its examination. There began in the 
country the still-continuing "witch-hunt" -- the campaign of destruction 
of the progressive and democratic forces of the American people, with the 
purpose of consolidating the control of the monopolists over the labor

movement. And it was not seldom that textual similarities were observed 
between decisions issued by American state organs and the recommendations 
worked out by the lAM and the Chamber of Commerce for a struggle against 
the "red danger." 
When the Association and the Chamber obtained the adoption in 1947 
of the draconic Taft-Hartley law, Congressman O'Toole of the House of 
Representatives openly testified that this law "was phrase for phrase, 
point for point, page for page, written by the National Association of 
Manufacturers." The anti-democratic program of the Chamber of Commerce 
and the NAM found its refleotion also in the extraordinary order of 
President Truman on testing loyalty; in the "internal security" law 
(McCatran-Pyrd Act adopted in 1950); in the law on immigration and 
naturalization (McCarran-Walter Act, adopted in 1952); and in the decision 
placing the American Communist Party outside the law (the BrownellBUtler 
Act, adopted in 1954). These laws, together with the Taft-Hartley law, 
become ominous landmarks of the era of police terror and political oppres-
sion in present-day America. 
Por the struggle against the labor movement, the rulers of the 
Association and the Chamber made wide use not only Of a number of terroris-
tic organizations of monopolistic capital, but also of the reactionary 
upper clique of the largest association of American trade unions, the 
American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations: Mieny, 
Carey, and the other servants of the magnates of Wall Street like them. 
The reformists within the labor movements, as well as the broad network 
of spies, informers, and provocateurs spread by the monopolists throughout 
the country, helped the monopolists to a considerable degree in carrying 
out their plans for the still greater economic and political enslavement 
of the people. 
The NAM and the Chamber of Commerce finance such organizations as 
the American Legion, the black-hundred band of the Ku Klux Klan, and 
many other fascist organizations. In the year 1951 alone, a group of 
the largest monopolies which held command in the NAM and the Chamber of 
Commerce allocated 350 million dollars to various reactionary organiza-
tions occupied in provocatory activity among the American workers and 
conducting subversive work in.foreign states. 
- The ChaMber and the Association, in trying to hinder the growth of 
the labor movement and seeking to place it under the complete, control of 
the monopolies, makes use of numerous detachments of professional spies, 
informers, and provocateurs. According to the evidence of the bourgeois 
journalist Gunther, the worker "never knows Who his neighbor on the con-
veyor belt is -- a spy or an honest man."

:In 1954 a new monstrous plot of the NAM and the Chamber of Commerce 
against the workers became known. One American trade union journal 
succeeded in obtaining and publishing the secret "Report No. 60," 
en-
titled "On Security in Indastry" prepared by the NAM and distributed only 
to "cooperating companies" and "for the information" of a small circle of 
reactionary journalists. This was .a carefully worked out plan for the 
further development of the. capitalist_incraisition in the country, for the 
creation_ef, a still wider netwerk of detectives and professional informers 
to spy on the ordinary American. In "Report No, 60" the companies are in-
structed how to create_ special "committees of security" and how to direct 
their activity. Among the tasks of these committees, "Which are under 
the supervision of the higher admiaistratiqn-g the enterprise," is 
included the denouncing of all "nnfnitl4nr. Workers with, the purpose of 
isolat.ing them and persecuting then further. In this connection, it is 
recommended, :or example, that the fingerprints of all workers be taken, 
that a, "loyalty oath" be extracted from them, and that a "system of 
obeel7Vatien of ,Werkere W.Oreated. That '!system" provided for the 
organilation? in each shop, of secret groups to which persons should be 
drawn "who enjoy trust" among the workers and who would, therefore, have 
more opportunity "to carry on observations of the actions and.conduct" 
of.the4x comrades. At the aame_time? it is suggested that the companies 
compile "files" on each worker, bringing into them all materials "com-
promising" him; to record what a worker has said in a locker room or at 
a,trade-union meeting, Whom he has met, to what organizations he belongs, 
and so_forth, 
A =Aber of_oonoerns, including the billionaire corporation General 
Electric, have already announced that any worker accused of being a "Red," 
or refusing to betray anyone at all to investigating committees oeaupied 
with hunting down democratically-minded persons, will be fired. 
In the spring of 1954, the Chamber of Commerce adopted, at its 
annual congress, a 27-page program on the trade union and labor movement, 
in which it openly demanded the banning of "solidarity strikes" and 
"picketing with the purpose of gaining recognition of the rights of trade 
unions," and also:the adoption by the American Congress of other measures 
aimed at depriving the workers of the most elementary rights in defense 
of their interests. George Armstrong, a representative of the National 
Association of Manufacturers, spoke before Congress -- the Committee 
on Labor Affairecf the. 'louse of Representatives -- with analogous demands. 
At the am time in, their press organs Washington Revort and Washington  
Bulletin, the NAA and the Chamber deman4ads4',Congress the adoption of 
"tougher" anti-lator legislation than:the Taft-Hartley Law. 
The U. S. Congress did not delay in satisfying these demands. A 
number of bills were presented in the House of Representatives and Senate 
during both sessions of the 83rd Congress, including those of Butler, 
Miller, Goldwater-Rhodes, Veldte, Benson and Brownell. These bills found

their fulfillment in the :Brownell-putler Law, adopted by the Congressmen. 
In appraising this activity of Congress, the trade-union press emphasized 
that the adoption of anti-labor laws by Congress "is exactly what the 
National Association of Manufacturers and the American Chamber of Commerce 
had demanded." 
Industry is ceasing rear guard battles and is Shifting to mass 
attack" thus did NAM director Miller describe yet another program of 
the rulers of American capital advanced by the 61st congress of the in-
dustrialists in 1956. The congress announced a new campaign against the 
workers and ,toilers to secure the interests of the monopolies. At the 
congress a five-year plan was advanced for the reduction of taxes on 
corporations; the execution of this plan would permit such taxes to be 
lowered about one-half. Inasmuch as no reduction in expenditures by the 
government was simultaneously envisaged, it becomes clear that the working 
people were supposed to compensate to the state treasury for this half. 
At the same time, social legislation was subjected to ferocious attacks 
by the industrialists. Parker, the president of the Association, called 
social security, pensions, unemployment aid, trade-union rights secured 
by law, and even.., hot breakfasts for school children "an alien body in 
the social svstem of America" Which Should be eliminated in order "to 
save the USA from creeping socialiSm." A demand was put forward for the 
adoption of "the toughest measures" and for the use of "police clubs" to 
curb the workers and the trade unions, for the application of the Taft-
Hartley law against strikers on a still wider scale, for the use of the 
"anti-trust" laws against trade unions (although those laws are intended 
to battle the arbitrary rale of the monopolies), for the mass applica-
tion of so-called "labor laws" setting forth the "right" of strike-
breakers to work, and for a number of other draconic measures. In dis-
cussing ways of putting the planned anti-popular measures into effect, 
the orators at the congress unanimously noted that the climate for this 
His now more favorable in Washington than at any other time", and that 
the voice of the industrialists would be listened to there with great 
attention. 
One day one of the aUxilliary organs of the NAM, the so-called 
National Council of Industrial Conferences, held a special convocation to 
discuss .ways and means to fight the trade unions. 
There spoke the convocation Colonel John F. Moran, the head of the 
division for questions of security in industry under the main chief of 
military police. "Industrialists," he declared, "should be ready to 
adept police measures -- to surround plants with dual barbed wire fences, 
electrically charged, to set up steel towers. with guards possessing fire-
arms, to take Use fingerprints of all workers." One of the industrialists 
attending the meeting displayed vivid interest in the experience of the 
Hitlerites; "What did the Germans do under Hitler to prevent the

interference of the communists?" he asked.. "They put them in concentra-
tion camps. They uncovered them with the aid of the secret policy. They 
did precisely what I have advised you to do this morning," answered 
Moran. 
This is the fate which is being prepared for the American workers 
by the magnates of large capital in the US -- the Morgans, the Rocke-
fellers, the Du,Ponts? the Fords, and the like. Into concentration camps! 
Behind bars: Behind electrified barbed wire! 
Against this the best of the American people are fighting now. The 
toilers are rebuffing the all-powerful monopolies. This is testified to 
by the growth of the strike movement, by the stubborn character of the 
strike battle of the workers. 
The American plutocracy is striving to suppress this valiant struggle. 
It ts,persecuting the militant organizations of the American working class. 
It whips itself into a fury, lies, slanders, deceives, undertakes desperate 
adventures, trying, with the help of a terroristic dictatorship, to support 
the foundations of capitalism. 
But there are no forces in the world that can halt the forward de-
velopment_ of mankind, or prevent the common people of all countries, in,-
eluding the American people as well, from taking the path of freedom, 
progress, universal happiness and prosperity.

Here, in Wall Street is the center of American finance capital, the

A, few decades ago, this was the only center of power in the USA. 
But later, other groupings of American finance capital also became stronger. 
La _Salle Street in the business district of Chicago has long become a cen-
ter of capital rivaling and competing with Wall Street and conducting a 
bitter struggle against it. In America, eight groups of finance capital 
can be counted. One of the mightiest of them is the oligarchy of the 
Morgans.

In the editorial office of one of the "respectable" American bourgeois 
newspapers, they stowed a visiting Soviet journalist the research section. 
In high iron cabinets stood meticulous files supplied with dividers and 
indices. In them was gathered everything which had been printed at any 
time about the heroes of the day of America -- financiers, politicians, 
gangeiters. A special "file" was devoted to each. From the number of 
newspaper and magazine clippings existing in them one can judge how 
famous is one or another "hero" of contemporary America. The "files" of 
the most well-known figures, who are now in their declining years, contain 
prepared obituaries to which there only remains to add two or three lines 
in case of need. 
The journalist asked them to dhow him the "files" of the most well-
known. people in the USA. They brought him dozens of swollen files. A 
renowned baseball player, half a dozen motion picture actors, two or 
three boxers. 
nut is it impossible to see what you have about the Morgan financiers?" 
the journalist asked the workers in the editorial office. Within a minute, 
there lay on the table a thin cardboard file. In it there turned out to 
be no more than, two or three dozen yellowing newspaper clippings. These 
were notes of the most innocent, chronicle-type nature. 
Attempts to clarify the causes of such "modesty" by the American press 
in depicting the activity of the uncrowned kings of America did not lead . 
to anything -- the workers of the editorial office did not desire to reveal 
their secrete. 
Everything that concerns the magnates of American monopolistic capital 
is sUbjected to the strictest invisible censorship in the largest American 
newspapers and magazines. There is nothing surprising here -- it is rare 
for one of these organs of the American press not to be dependent on 
finanCe capital. Burning incense of the most delicate flattery to them, 
depicting them in the role of "philanthropists" and "benefactors," the 
bourgeois press at the same time carefully masks and hides their real 
business. And only in a few progressive newspapers, which experience 
continual financial difficulties and which are baited by the "large" capi-
talist press and by the entire apparatus of subtle, dangerous and pernicious 
propaganda, is it possible to find unmasking words of truth about the dic-
tatorship of financial monopolistic capital of the US and about its most 
influential representatives, the Morgans. 
The dynasty of the Morgans is represented now by two brothers. On 
the board of the bank of J. P. Morgan and Company in Wall Street sits the 
vice president of this bank, Junius Spencer Morgan. His brother Henry 
Sturgis has, since 1928, been a partner in another Morgan bank, Morgan,

Stanley and Company, and a director in the huge concern of General Electric. 
The present-day sprouts of the oligarchic empire of Morgan, evidently, 
:do not shine with talents ,- they strive to keep themselves in the shadow 
and occupy secondary posts in their banks. The posts of presidents and 
chairmen of the board of the Morgan banks are held by more experienced 
executives of Wall Street0 each as Whitney, Leffingwell, Alexander, and 
others. 
For the purposes of advertising, the press agents of the Morgans have 
spread_ a_nromantic," legend about their origin. They assert that these 
magnates of Wall Street trace their ancestry to the pirate Henry Morgan, 
who a,century and a half ago plundered English and Spanish Ships in the 
Gulf of Mexico and. the Carribbean Sea. One of the Morgans, John Pierpoint 
the younger, even named his steam yacht -- to all appearance recalling a 
miniature ormiser -- "The Corsair" (The Pirate). 
More objective research has dispelled this legend. It has turned 
out that the founder of the banking dynasty, Joseph Morgan, was only an 
owner of taverns, inns, and stagecoach lines in Hartford (state of 
Connecticut). The first insurance company in the USA was created by this 
Morgan. His son, Junius Spencer Morgan, entered trade; the stores and 
factories of his firm were located in New York and. Boston. In 1853, the 
young Junius Morgan took all of his capital with him to London. There, 
he soon became a partner in the banking house of Peabody and Company. 
Within ten years the American newcomer had forced out his English patron; 
the banking firm began to be called "J. P. Morgan." It exists to this 
day as a branch of the New York beak of the Morgans and is called Morgan, 
Greenfell and Company. 
The first executive of the basic American branch of the dynasty of 
the Morgans was John Pierpont Morgan I. His father, Junius Spencer, sent 
John Pierpont to New 'York not long before the start of the civil war in 
the USA.. 
The bank of tbe Morgans in New York was created in 1863. Wars sup-
plied this bank with "primary accumulation." During the period of the 
civil war between North and South the Morgan bank, through corrupt persons, 
purchased from the government rifles rejected by the war department, and 
then sold them to the very same government. This led to a noisy scandal, 
but it did not touch the Morgan profits. One of Morgan?s biographers 
wrote about this activity of his daring a difficult time for the American 
people: "During the trying days of the civil war, the young Morgan, con-
centrating strictly on his own affairs, advanced himself slowly but surely. 
In 1863 he speculated in gold in an extremely unpatriotic way."

The young banker's complete lack of patriotism was felt not only in 
this. In 1863, after a number of heavy defeats of the Northern troops, 
the US Congress passed a law on military conscription. The businessmen 
and their lackeys seated in Congress introduced into this law a special 
article permitting rich men of conscription age to supply other recruits 
in place of themselves. Enterprising businessmen immediately created 
special offices to seek out young Americans whom need or other misfortunes 
compelled to undergo the fire of the southern racists for a comparatively 
small aim, John Pierpont Morgan was also released from military service --
for 300 dollars one of these offices found A lad who was Sent into the 
army in place of the young banker. 
. :More than one young employer who bought himself off in this way --
wrote R. Boyer and G. Moreys, historians of the American labor movement --
discovered that he was fully reimbursed. Looking through the lists pub-
lished in the newspapers, many of them learned that the poor lads who 
had gone into the army in their place had laid down their lives on the 
fields of battle. Three hundred dollars was not high payment for preserving 
one's life, particularly under conditions when life brought greater and 
greater profits with every day, to the extent that millions of dollars were 
spent in the form of military orders. 
In. 1890, the center of the Morgan financial empire was finally trans-
ferred from London to New York, to 23 Wall Street. The crude, powerful, 
and aggressive John Pierpont Morgan, with a massive head, an enormous 
mastache, and deeply inset eyes, behaved scornfully toward people. He had 
almost no friends. Even the paid biographers of Morgan said that he had 
a "feudal tarn of mind." 
Expanding his financial empire, Morgan pitilessly destroyed his rivals 
and competitors. "He fought with the financial pirates of his time, using 
their own weapons, and, sustaining a victory over them, acquired great 
influence," one of his biographers wrote about Morgan. Morgan seized the 
Albany and. Susquehanna Railroad from D. Gould and James Fish, great mag-
nates of that time. Making use of a normal economic crisis, he ruined 
another magnate of Wall Street, a certain Jay Cooke. 
By the end of the last century, Morgan had already become a force 
which was far from small. Granting the American government a private 
loan of 50 million dollars, he helped it to stabilize state finances. 
The government has come under the power of private financiers," American 
newspapers wrote at that time. Morgan. refused to inform the press how 
madh he profited by this operation. 
More dollars, more might, more power. Morgan ruins Carnegie, Moore, 
Gates -- among the largest capitalists of that time. He tears the Northern 
Pacific Railroad away from Edward Harriman. When, in 1907, a cruel crisis 
broke out, Morgan, with the aid of complex operations, saved the state

finances which were invested in private banks. In gratitude for this, the 
government silently consented to his seizure of his recent competitor, 
the Tennessee Coal and Iron Company. Theodore Roosevelt, the President 
at the time, approved this transaction, although it represented a clear 
violation of the so-called "antitrust laws.!' 
*eying seized the?OOmmanAing heights of the American economy, Morgangs 
banking house was the first of the American banks to begin to invest capi-
tal outside the USA, As early as 1870, when the workers of Paris were 
raising the ideals of the commune in France in a straggle for their rights, 
and the government fled from Paris to Tours, Junius Spencer Morgan I or-
ganized a loan to the French government. After the end of the Franco-
Prassian. war the bank of J. P. Morgan took part in an international syn-
dicate which profited from the payment of many millions in war indemnities 
by Prance, 
Since the turn of the century, Morgan?s dollars have poured in a 
broad stream abroad -- into Argentina, Honduras, Bolivia, and Peru. They 
have penetrated into Europe and. Asia. The labor of thousands of people 
and t4e. natural riches of these countries have become sources of um.-
precedented enrichment for the American magnates of finance capital. 
Not organizational talents, not capacity for invention, not great 
scientific discoveries, but money, the power of the dollar placed the 
Morgans at the helm of the administration of entire branches of industry. 
American economists calculated in 1957 that the three Chief Morgan 
financial concerns alone -- J. P. Morgan and Co., Oaarantee Trust, and 
Bankers Trust -- now control hundreds of industrial concerns, trusts and 
companies with a total capital of 106 billion dollars -- about one-tenth 
of the: entire national wealth of the USA. The financial "empire" was 
created by the Morgans in a bitter struggle for sources of new profits, 
for new means of exploitation of the toilers. In this struggle their 
rivals and competitors are inflicting painful blows on them. The Hooke-
feller, bank, Chase Manhattan, through unknown means has acquired part 
ownership in Morganos General Electric, and Rockefellerus capital is 
oozing into the holy of holies of the Morgans -- the 14 billion dollar 
concern, American Telephone and Telegraph (ATT). 
Bat the Morgans, too, are not behindhand. Their capital is oozing 
into the Mellon machine-building trust, Westinghouse Electric, into 
DuPont's General Motors, and even...into the patrimony of the Rockefellers, 
Standard Oil of New Jersey. 
A brawl has not ceased, either, for rule within the apparatus of the 
state administration of the USA. Representatives of the Rockefeller oil 
monopolies have expelled Morgan representatives from many government posts 
in Washington.

But the last decisive word in this struggle has not yet been said. 
The Morgans in essence have engulfed the Boston financial grouping, they 
are approatbing the Giannini banking system (Bank of America, on the West 
Coast), and they have no intention of yielding the reins of state rule 
to their competitors. 
The financial empire of the Morgans 'contains industrial concerns, 
and railroads, municipal trusts (mainly electric power and gas), banks 
and insurance companies. Three-quarter of them belong to the 250 largest 
concerns of the US. The banking oligarchy of the Morgans uses its con-
trol for the brutal exploitation of millions of Americans, which bringb 
it fabulous profits. 
The Morgan trusts and concerns, in a number of cases-, almost wholly 
embrace entire branches of industry, United States Steel, the steel 
trust of the Morgans, produce more than 35 percent of all the steel in 
the USA. At the disposal of the trust are two shipping companies and 
107 ships. The steel trust possesses four railroads and the largest 
COmpany for cement production in the USA. To it belong the largest iron 
ore beds in the US. -- Mesabi (state of Minnesota). Nowadays this Morgan 
trust is closing in on the reserves of iron Ore in Venezuela (Cerro-
Bolivar Mountain), and the ore of Canadian Labrador. 
The first president of United States Steel was a judge by the name 
of E. Gary. The workers hated him; they said of him that he "saw a blast 
furnace for the first time only after his death -- in hell." Gary was 
replaced by Myron Taylor who was subsequently the personal envoy of the 
President of the US to the Vatican; Taylor was replaced by Edward 
Stettinius, Jr., who at one time held the post of US Secretary of State. 
At the time of the creation of the steel trust in 1901, its capital 
amounted to over one billion dollars. Nowadays that capital exceeds 3.5 
billion dollars. This was the first billionaire concern, which laid the 
foundation of the "billionaire& club" to which 77 of the largest banks 
and industrial concerns now belong. 
. -Savage terror has always reined in the plants of United States Steel. 
Company epic's and hired criminals have expelled progressive workers and 
trade-union organizers, have expelled all those who have tried to unite 
the workers to rally them for a straggle against savage exploitation. 
But as early as 1919 American metallurgical workers began to organize 
themselves into trade unions. In that year, under the leadership of 
William Z. Poster (subsequently the eminent leader of the Communist Party 
of the UV) the first general metallurgists strike unfolded, laying the 
basis for the unification of the workers into a trade union of steel 
workers.

To this day they remember that strike in America; it has gone down 
in the history of the US labor movement as the "great strike." Three 
hundred and sixty-five thousand workers struck in 50 cities; 1,5 million 
Americans, together with their families, entered into a difficult, tense 
struggle against the capitalist exploiters. In all, 4,0000000 workers 
struck in the USA during that year. 
For the suppression of the strike, the Morgans threw against the 
workers troops willingly furnished them by the authorities of the states 
and, the government. At the center of the strike -- the city of Gary in 
the state a Indiana, which has almost merged now with the suburbs of 
Chicago -- government troops sent to suppress the strike were commanded 
by Major General Wood. Hundreds of strikers were beaten and wounded, 
thousands arrested, and 22 American workers gave their lives in this 
struggle. 
* Gary, president of, United States Steel, frightened by the events 
of the Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia, asserted that the 
goal of the strike was. allegedly "the Sovietization of the US metallurgical 
industry." In. answer, the workers cited facts: the unbearable 12-hour 
working day, and the high prices for objects of primary necessity, prices 
which had leaped by two times on the average during the participation of 
the US in the first world war. 
Three months of bitter strike straggle brought the workers the main 
and most valuable thing -- organization, the ability to fight the class 
enemy in strike battles. The present-day strikes of the steel workers 
are the most. decisive class battles, of labor against capital in America. 
The present president of the company, Benjamin Fairless, is famous 
for his savage violence against the workers. During one of the strikes 
at the, plant in Massillon, Fairless drove 500 strike-breakers to the plant, 
and led. them himself in an attack on the strikers. His name is hateful 
to every worker in the plants of the steel trust of the Morgans. 
The electric machine-building trust General Electric, and the grain.. 
milling plants of Genera]. Mills, the enterprises of the food industry 
(General Foods), and the enormous system of electrical communications 
(American Telephone and Telegraph) have plants in Japan, Germany, France, 
Italy, Morocco, England, Austria, Belgium, Chili, Spain, Turkey, Sweden, 
Rolland, Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, and Uruguay. Maxy hundreds of thou-
sands of persons labor in these plants, multiplying the wealth of the 
Morgans, 
The Morgans have long invested their capital in the production of 
military and strategic raw materials. Their company Kennecott Copper, 
together with Phelps Dodge and Anaconda Copper Mining, hold in their

hands one third of the copper extracted in the capitalist countries. To 
the bank of J, P. Morgan and Co. belongs 16 director's posts in trusts 
of the copper industry. And this is no accident. It is evident that 
copper has long had enormous significance for military production. 
The appearance of a new type of weapon -- atomic -- has opened a 
new source of enrichment for the Morgans. 
The oligarchic group of the Morgans, from the very beginning occupied 
a ruling position in the development of the atomic armament industry. 
Together with the concerns of the Du Pots and the Rockefellers, the Morgans 
"administer" the enterprises of the atomic industry of the USA. 
The system of this "administration" represents a cunning device of 
the American monopolies, with the aid of Which they kill at least three 
birds with one stone. Understanding what enormous responsibility they 
would bear in unleashing the armament race, the rulers of the American 
monopolies managed to have the enterprises of the atomic industry (in 
which more than 12 billion dollars are already invested) declared the 
"property of the state." The private capitalist monopolies took on them-
selves only the "administration" of them. Thus, the atomic armament indus-
try has been built with funds of the American taxpayers, and the monopolies 
have not had to risk their own capital. The concerns "administering" these 
plants nominally receive, in all, only one symbolic dollar a-Year. However, 
enormous profits fall to them in the guise of payment of expenses of 
"administration.," through the transfer to them of rights to patents to 
individual processes of atomic production, patents to apparatus, equipment, 
and so forth. Responsibility for the production of atomic weapons and for 
the consequences connected with its application is borne by the government, 
but only formally. 
In the field of US atomic armament, the Morgans act not only as 
suppliers, but also as bosses. The recommendation to use atomic weapons 
against Japan was adopted by a special committee created under the US War 
DepartmentinMarch 1945. The leading role in this committee was played 
by George Harrison and James Byrnes, Who later held the post alas Secre-
tary of State. Harrison at that time was president of the Morgan insurance 
company, New York Life Insurance. Byrnes, both then and now, is closely 
connected with the Morgan Newmont Mining Company, occupied in prospecting 
for uranium and the exploitation of uranium beds. Sedrettry of War Stimson, 
who headed that special committee, was closely connected with firms in 
which Morganis capital was invested -- the legal firm headed by him had 
fulfilled important tasks for this banking house and received large fees 
from it. This is on Whom lies the genuine, and not the formal responsi-
bility, for the fate of the victims of Nagasaki and Hiroshima%

A strong chain of Morgan financial ties binds the companies extracting 
uranium. nn4 the government organs for control over atomic raw materials 
with the banking house of J. P. Morgan and Company. These ties have been 
partially shown by James Allen, a well-known specialist on American monopo-
listic associations. 
When, in the United States, there was created a government organ --
the Commission on Atomic Energy -- to Which the "state" atomic enterprises 
were subordinated, then a certain John Gustafson, a representative of the 
Morgan company Newmont Mining, was named director of the atomic raw mate-
rials division in this commission. Six out of the eight members of a 
consultative committee created somewhat later by the government to handle 
questions of prospecting and extracting atomic raw materials were employees 
of the Morgans. These were a certain Fred. Searles (president of Newmont 
Mining). A. Gray (the Morgan copper mining company Kennecott Copper), 
T. Brtdgeman (the firm Guggenheim Brothers, closely connected with the 
Morgan banks), R. McConnell .(with ties with Morgan capital through the 
firm RoxanpaGarporation), W. Judson (director of the company Texas Gulf 
Sulphur, belonging to Newmont Mining and to the Mellons jointly), and 
also german garnPho.diPectOr of one of the Morgan mining companies and 
brotlieT_CI the well-known Morgan financier Bernard Baruch. 
Within the very shortest period the Morgan monopolies have grasped 
within their.han40 the riChest,sources of atomic raw material. Now they 
are striving for control over uraniUM ore beds throughout the entire capi-
talist A.main weapon of theirs in this straggle is the interna-
tional concern International Nickel Company, in which the Morgans rule 
jointly with the financial groups of the DaPonts, the Rockefellers, the 
Mellons, and the British Imperial Chemical Trust. The interests of the

on the board of International Nickel Company, Bell Telephone System. The 
head of, the nickel-uranium concern International Nickel, R. Stanley, is 
simultaneously a director of Morgan?0 United States Steel and General

The greedy hands of the Morgans stretch out Also toward the mineral 
riches of Africa. The "Anglo-American Corporation of South Africa," in 
which a prominent role belongs to the capital of the Morgans, through 
dozens of smaller mining companies Which are subordinate to it financially, 
holds in its hands a considerable part of the mineral riches of the Congo, 
including uranium deposits. Moreover, the raw materials division of the 
government commission on atomic energy, in which, as has been shown above, 
the representatives of the Morgan monopolies rule, has concluded an agree-
ment with the government of the South African Union granting the monopolies 
of the US., and above all the Morgans, a considerable portion of control 
over South African uranium deposits.

The monopolistic position of the Morgans in the field of atomic prodne-
tion, a position Which they Share with only a small number of the other of 
the largest monopolistic groupings of the US, has permitted them to 
seize the commanding heights in other fields of atomic energy as well. 
The chief representative of the Morgans in this field is their electro-
machine-building company, General Electric, Which "manages" a plant for 
the production of plutonium in Hanford with 'a value of 350 million dollars. 
General Electric has spent another 400 million dollars on additional con-
struction and expansion of this plant. George kraut, vice-president of 
General Electric and manager of the atomic plant in Hanford, his set forth 
the Morgan program in the field of atomic armament as follows; to put 
an end to handicraft methods in the production of atomic weapons, and to 
place that production on a modern industrial basis. 
To the Morgans there belongs also the renowned Knowle Laboratory, 
which is concerned with experiments in the field of adapting atomic 
engines for military purposes (for submarines, military airplanes, and 
so forth). The Morgans are also using their ruling position in this 
field to establish their monopoly in the field of peaceful ayplication of 
atomic energy, Which they are hindering, inasmuch as the electric power 
companies are in their hands. 
It is therefore not surprising that the representatives of the Morgans 
have a place on all the committees named by the government Of the USA to 
work out Plans of "international control" (in essence, the rule of the 
American monopolies) in the field of atomic weapons and atomic energy.

dent of Newmont Mining, was on the US delegation in the UN for negotia, 
tions on questions of atomic energy. Bernard Baruch who headed the 
delegation, had long been connected with the Morgan mining companies. 
That delegation tried to drag through the UN plans for the creation 
of an "international organ" possessing all the atomic enterprises in the 
world, an organ in which American -- above all Morgan ?.monopolies would 
rale. Such plans are still being advanced in order to torpedo the estab-
lishment of genuine international control over atomic energy, and to 
obstruct the banning of the use of atomic weapons; the American monopolies 
categorically object to such banning.

Like other magnates of finance capital of the US, the Morgans are 
not content with their role Of Manufacturers, industrialists, and bankers, 
In order to secure the greatest possible profits for themselves, they

Both parties of the American bourgeoisie -- the Republican and the 
Democratic parties -- secure the political power of the monopolistic 
capital of the USA. The leading hierarchy of these parties is in the 
service of he largest financial oligarchies of the USA. It is precisely 
they Who rule in these parties, Who determine their policy, and who 
advance their own henchmen. to the highest posts in the state. 
Morgan's capital has brought more than one politician into the White 
_ _ 
Rause, to the post of president of the US. Theodore Roosevelt -- who was 
virtually the most aggressive representative of the American monopolies 
to occupy the White Rouse,7-_was a henchman of the Morgans. To him be.-
longs the swing; "Speak softly and carry a big stick.." These catchwords 
have long become the motto_of the foreign policy of American imperialism. 
The well-known American journalist Landberg wrote; "Theodore Roosevelt 
was raised by the Morgan clique from the first stages to the very height 
of .,140 political career... When one studies Theodore Roosevelt's two terms 
at president it becomes obvious that, thanks to his assistance, this period 
was*periOd of the greatest flourishing of the firm J. P. Morgan and Co., 
and of As clients.., The evidence of this is irrefutable." 
, 
To deceive the voters, Theodore Roosevelt made demagogic speeches 
in which he "destroyed" the magnates of Wall Street. But to strengthen 
his tied with finance capital, he gave secret dinners for Morgan in the 
White Rouse, 
President Coolidge was, according to the testimony of the American 
journalist Landberg, "simply a marionette," a "henchman of John Pierpont 
Morgan." In 1933, one of the committees of the American Senate estab-
lished. that Coo1idge enjoyed great privileges in the bank of J. P. Morgan 
and Co. With the aid of that bank, the man who was then President bought 
stock of different companies at large discounts, Thus was bought the 
influence of the banks of Wall Street over the entire policy of the coun-
try, foreign and domestic.

The Republican President Herbert Hoover was also a henchman of Morgan 
in the White House, Hoover was placed in the government apparatus of the 
USA after the first world war on the recommendation of one of Morgan's 
partners, a oertainThompson. In the government headed by Hoover were 
representatives of the banking house of J. P. Morgan and Co, Among them 
wereHenry_Stimson,,Secretary of State, and S. Adams, Secretary of the 
Navy. Hooyees chief advisers on questions of foreign policy were 
Morgan's associates in his bank, D. Morrow and T. Lamont, 
The White House in Washington was linked with Morgan's office at 
23 Wall Street in New York by a direct telephone connection. Through 
this telephone line there came to the White House "advice" which eounded 
like orders. 
Sherman Adams, a very cloie relative of Henry Sturgis Morgan, director 
of many trusts and concerns connected through the Boston group with the 
Morgans, is presently one of the Chief political advisers of the White 
House. 
Many direct representatives of the banking house of the Morgans 
occupy leading posts in the apparatus administering the machine of American 
diplomacy. US Assistant Secretary of State John Perkins is the son of a 
Morn partner. For a long time the post of US Ambassador to England was 
held by Gifford, a Morgan partner. The textile manufacturer Robert 
Stevens, fOnnerSeczetarythe ArraY,,. is connected with the Morgan concerns, 
and ep on4. Carrying out the will of the largest oligarchic groups of 
US finance capital, these people lead the country Along the path of reac-
tion, the path of an armament race and preparation of a new war. 
In order to plunge the people into the abyss of military adventures, 
it is, necessary to deceive them, to make them senseless through malicious 
propaganda. For this, the Morgans need not only police, courts, prisOns 
and soldiers. They need skilful demagogues and deceivers, people propa-
gandizing their "ideas," people capable of creating in Americans the 
nOtions, ideas, tastes and aspirations necessary to Wall Street. ,A wide-
spread system of hired propaganda serves this purpose, existing on the 
money of the monopolies and acting according to its order. 
In the USA there are no large radio companies, publishing houses, or 
newspapers which are not tied in with the monopolies of Wall Street or 
wiliCh could be independent.of them. Here are a few facts. Within the 
sphere of Morgan capital is the publishing house, Curtis Publishing 
Company,, and the publishing company, McCall Corporation. John Cowles, 
the publisher of the magazine Look, is a director of the Morgan concern 
General Eleotric., H. Luce's publishing concern, which puts out the 
ardhreactionary magazines Time, Life, and Fortune, was created with the

The largest American companies in radio broadcasting (Radio Corpora-
tion Of America) and in motion pictures (RK0 -- "Radio Keith-Orpheum", 
Warner Brothers, and others) are controlled by the Morgan and Rocke-
feller banks and are financially dependent on them. 
Row Wall Streets conducts propaganda for reaction, fascism, and war 
is clearly visible, from the example of, say, the magazine Colliers. 
This magazine in a "special issue", in October 1951, depicted the 
fantastic details of an armed occupation of the Soviet Union by American 
neo4(albruckians; they dream about such an occupation both asleep and 
awake in Wall Street. 
The filthy dish of the editors of Colliers aroused enormous indigna-
tion throughout the entire world. It compelled even those who at times 
have silently listened to the militaristic propaganda of the Morgan 
literary day laborers to say a word of protest.

The great American satirist Mark Twain, who hated American imperialism 
with all the strength of his great soul, and Who boldly unmasked its 
monstrouverimes, ironically wrote, unmasking the wretched ideology of 
capital, an ideology of bloody profit: 
";Let us pray. Oh God, help us tear their soldiers to pieces with 
our shells, help um sow their flowering fields with the bodies of their 
patriots, help us destroy their peaceful homes with a hurricane of fire: 
help us break with inconsolable grief the hearts of widows who are not 
guilty of anything; help us deprive them of shelter and compel them to 
wander With their children in rags, without refuge, across the ravaged 
land, suffering from hunger and thirst." 
And this is what Thomas W. Lamont, Morgan's chief partner, said in 
his speech at the American Academy of Political and Social Sciences in 
Philadelphia in 1915: 
"If the war continues so long that we Shall come to occupy such a 
position," (under which the USA "would be turned into a creditor of the 
entire world" -- V. M.), "and if we have safficient resources to cope 
with this task, then we inevitably would be turned from a debtor country 
into a creditor country, aad such growth will sooner or later result in 
the fact that the dollar, insteadofthepoundstlitgoallbpatmejnterriaticrial 
exchange unit." Lamont cynically declared that protraction of the war 
has "the most important financial significance for the country." 
War and imperialist aggression have always served as a source of 
enormous gain, of monstrous enrichment for the mOnopolies of Wall Street.

When,one of the most bloody pages in the history of imperialism 
opened, and the deadly thunder of weapons of the first world war resounded 
in the fields of Europe, an atmosphere Of joyful excitement ruled in Wall 
Street. A time of military business had arrived -- the most profitable 
business for the Morgans and their colleagues -- bankers, industrialists, 
landowners. 
As early as the first few months after the start of the war, the 
banking house,of J. P. Morgan and Co. sent to Europe Morgan's partner, 
Henry Davison, 'bo negotiate the financing of military orders. . 
The banking house of Morgan became the main trade representative of the 
Entente countries in America. Morgan's agents bought up everything that 
could be needed by the warring powers -- from munitions and ammunition 
to provisions and canned meat -- thus gaining enormous commissions. 
Sixty. Wall Street banks took part in these operations of the Morgans. 
During the period. preceding the entry of the US into the first world war, 
the banking house of Morgan granted loans of 1.5 billion dollars to 
England and France alone. 
In America they say: the heart of a banker is where his money is. 
The magnates of Wall Street, their henchmen and their agents attentively 
followed the fate of their loans, percentages, and dividends. When con-
ditions on the fronts were not going well for England and Prance -- the 
main debtors to Wall Street -- and the billions of dollars invested by 
the American financiers in the war appeared to be threatened. Wall 
Street decided to intervene. All the more, since direct participation 
in the war opened perspectives for still greater profit. 
Walter Haynes Page the US Ambassador to England, telegraphed 
President. Wilson on 5 March 1917z "The international financial situation 
is threatening for the financial and industrial prospects of the United 
States. The danger of a complete breach of Prance-American exchange is 
approaching. An inevitable consequence would be the sharp reduction of 
orders by all the allied governments and the practically complete Cessa-
tion of transatlantic trade. As a result, a crisis would begin in the 
USA... If the United States declares war on Germany, then...the USA 
waaldcontinue to receive profit continuously, and would expand its trade 
for a number of years..." "The only way of preserving the present 
advantageous position of the US in trade, and of averting a crisis, is in 
, declaring war on GerMany," Page concluded. The ambassador was connected 
with the Morgan banks in the closest way. 
To make the dollar the master of the world -- this is the task which 
Wall Street posed for itself even then. Under the roofs of the Wall 
Street skyscrapers they dreamed not of peace, but of a long, profitable 
war, calculated to establish the world rule of the American bankers.

"We are entering the war at the order of the 'golden calf'," 
declared. Senator Norris. "Soon, we shall place the dollar sign on the 
American flag." 
To Washington streamed bankers, industrialists, factory-owners, 
speculators and. camp followers in. frock coats and dress shirts. Govern-
ment posts were seized. by bankers from Wall Street, captains of industry, 
and. enterprising businessmen. They were helped by ties with leaders of 
the political parties, who well understood from whom and. in what sums the 
checks came to them to carry on election campaigns. 
The leadership of the war industry apparatus was in the hands of 
the Morgan henchman Bernard Baruch. Leading posts in the system of the 
administration of war industry were occupied by Walter Gifford, vice-
president of Morgan's American Telephone and Telegraph Company, D. A. 
Pixel', president of Morgan's United States Steel, John Ryan, president 
of Anaconda Copper Corporation, and others. Edward Stetinius Sr., a 
partner of J. P. Morgan, was Assistant Secretary of War. Another Morgan 
associate ? Russell Leffingwell ? was until very recently president of 
the bank of J. P. Morgan and Co., and. during the first world war was 
named Assistant Secretary of the Treasury. Dozens of other representa-
tives of the greatest financial oligarchies of the US have held. the most 
important posts in the governmental apparatus. 
These merchants from Wall Street controlled the entire war industry 
of the United States. They distributed profitable war orders. On them 
depended the distribution of short-supply raw materials, fuel, and. labor. 
Wall Street threw ten billion dollars of the taxpayers' money annually 
into the cauldron of war. 
Wall Street profited from the first world. war as from no other war 
before that time. Direct military expenditures of the US from April 
_ 
1917 through November 1919 amounted to 35.5 billion dollars. Prom January 
1916, when Wall Street began to prepare itself for entry into the war, 
through July 1921, when military production was stopped in the US, the 
profits of the corporations amounted. to 38 billion dollars. 
Enormous sums accrued to the largest imperialist plunderers. The 
government o:f the USA paid out 400 million dollars to Morgan's bank to 
cover loans issued by Morgan to the English government. The Morgan con-
cern United States Steel increased its profits by twelve times in the first 
two years of the war. The blood profits of other monopolies of Wall 
Street also grew sharply. 
Hundreds of millionaires appeared in the USA during the first world 
war. ?n America they called them the "war millionaires."

The United States, Which at one time had owed money to Europe, now 
became a?warld creditors by 19210 European countries owed it 15 billion 
dollars. America alone gained from the war. It turned from -a country 
having a mass of debts to a country to Whom all were indebted. The 
billionaires of Wall Street profited from the war more than anybodY. 
The arms were stacked, the first world war had ended. Included in , 
the American delegation, emissaries of Morgan were sent to the Versailles 
Conference. Baruch and Thomas Lamont took active part in working out the 
Versailles treaty. The American press blundered one day, revealing that 
the text of the peace treaty had came to the bank of J. P. Morgan and Co. 
for approval before it was presented for ratification to the US Senate. 
The ink had not winpiced to dry on this treaty when American banks, 
and eajp? all 11)e. bank of J. P. Morgan, undertook the restoration of the 
military and Industrial potential of Germany. 
J. P. Morgan himself took part in the working out the "Young plan," 
as a member of the international committee of experts. This plan, which 
received. its tit1e from the name of its authar.-- Owen D. 'Twang, chairman 
of the board of Margan?s General Electric -, provided for the financing 
of the rebirth of the German military machine. Prom 1924 through 1929, 
Wall Street granted Germany loans and credits of four billion dollars 
for these purposes. A. considerable part of these funds was granted by 
the Mprgan banks. The preparation of war, of new profit on mass killings, 
death.and,destraction, went an at full speed. 
The second. world war brought the Morgans and the other financial 
oligarchs of the USA new profits. At once, into Washington there streamed 
representatives of the largest monopolies; at once, they seized the 
apparatus of administration of the war industry; at once, a bitter struggle 
began for war orders, for profit. The profit carve at once began to creep 
upward sharply. 
It is not surprising therefore that the end of the second world 
war was greeted in Wall Street as a deadly threat to the profits of the 
monopolies. Large capital decreed a "cold war" an armaments race, and 
preparation for a now slaughter. 
* * * 
The American working class does not calmly put up with the policy 
which Wall Street dictates. It fights against this policy. 
_ . 
T4eiwave of the strike. movement reached its greatest height (two 
million strikers) precisely in 1952, when the drawn,-out war in Korea had 
sharply. worsened tension in international relations and had increased the 
danger of war.

The rulers of Wall Street know of these sentiments of the American 
people and fear them. They strengthen reactionary terror. The Morgans 
and their agents and representatives play a considerable role in this. 
At the beginning of the 1930s, there had been created in the House 
of Representatives of the American Congress a committee for the investiga-
tion of so-called "Un-American activities." The committee paid almost 
no attention at all to investigating the truly un-American activity of the 
Hitlerite fascist underground in the USA during the war.' But it became 
the center of bitter persecution of all organizations that were in any 
way progressive, and of individual social and political leaders. When, 
after the War, Karl Mundt, a member of the House of Representatives from 
the state of South Dakota, entered this committee, he turned for instruc-
tions -- according to the words of the American journal The New Republic --
to John W. Davis. In a special letter Mundt asked that he be given 
precise instructions as to what the committee dhould concern itself with. 
The instructions Which Mundt received from Davis formed the basis of the 
work of the committee. 
Who is this John W. Davis, and why is it precisely to him that the 
American gaper-reactionaries tarn for advice and schooling? 
He is the chief legal consultant of Morgan's bank. By the grace of 
the Morgans, he waa at one time placed in the post of Assistant Attorney 
General, and then was US Ambassador to Great Britain. This is what Davis 
said of himself: "Vire have an excellent clientele. What lawyer does not 
envy me? In the list of py clients are included J. P. Morgan and Co., 
(the Erie Railroad, the Guaranty Trust Company, Standard Oil Company, 
and others of the most eminent American concerns. These are the greatest 
organizations, and I am happy to work for them... We are for large capi-
tal." Davis is one of the chief authors of the anti-labor Taft-Hartley 
law. 
The assistants of the American monopolies are trying -- not for the 
first time -- to inflict a regime of black reaction on the American 
people. They have always supported pro-fascist organizations in the USA. 
On the eve of the second world war there were 109 of these in the US, and 
five million Americans were connected with them. H. V. Prentis, then 
president of the National Association of Manufacturers, indeed admitted --
revealing the plans of the large monopolies -- that American capital 
possibly "would tarn to some variety of disguised fascist dictatorship." 
The henchmen of the Morgan monopolies take active part in subversive 
diversionary activity directed against the countries of the camp of peace, 
democracy and socialism. One of the organizers of the notorious com-
mittee "Crusade for Freedom," on which the radio transmitters of the 
"Voice of Free Europe" relies for support, was the not-unknown General 
Lucius Clay, president of Morgan's Continental Can Company. These

organizers led the "crusade" of the monopolies for the restoration of 
the power of the capitalists and landowners in the socialist countries; 
together with other. emissaries and agents of American intelligence, they 
provoked the fascist putsch against the people's authority in Hungary. 
On then: fell the blood of the patriots of new, free Hungary, spilled, by 
the Hungarian fascists who were agents of the American espionage services. 
* * * 
The hired propagandists of the imperialist monopolies of the US 
knock themselves out to disguise the true reactionary role of large 
monopolistic capital, to hide the rags of the bourgeois democratic dicta-
torehip of this capital ruling in the USA. But life and daily reality do 
not leave one Stone of these false assertions standing. Facts -- stubborn, 
unalterable facts -- unmask the rule of the uncrowned kings of America 
and. their responsibility for that path, dangerous for the American people 
and. for the cause of peace, along Which the lords of capital are leading 
the TJSA. 
Oil. Rlookand Dollars O. Peofanov 
When American bombers rise into the heaven and American tanks creep 
along foreign soil, dollars pour into the safes of the Rockefellers. 
When in the oil-refining plants of Arabia workers perish under the 
weight of hard labor, in another hemisphere, it New York, in the office 
of the Rockefellers, they count up the dividends without any emotion. 
When the American fleet ploughs the waters of the Taiwan Straits, 
insolently trampling on the rights of the Chinese people to the territory 
which has been theirs since time immemorial -- the island of Taiwan --
into the current account of the Rockefellers are entered new profits. 
Oil and war are business for the Rockefellers.

In the center of New York, in a narrow strip of Manhattan between 
West 48th and West 51st Streets and Fifth and Sixth Avenues, there rises 
a group of skyscrapers erected with the money of John D. Rockefeller Jr. 
Itis no accident that these skyscrapers are called "Rockefeller Center": 
here is the residence of the American "oil king." The black shadow of 
the Rockefeller palaces extends far beyond the bounds of the United States 
of Americas

gere, at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, is located the center of administra-
tion,Of the six largest companies, controlling more than half the oil 
industry, headed by the renowned Standard Oil of New Jersey. Prom here 
the greedy hands of the Rodkefellers stretch out to Arabia and Venezuela, 
to Iran and Canada, 
Here too, in the center of New. York, the transactions of the family 
banking house of the Rockefellers, the Chase Manhattan Bank, are carried 
out in quiet offices. This beak, with a capital of almost 8 billion 
dollars, is one of the largest in the capitalist world. 
Included in the financial empire of the "oil kings," besides the 
Chase Manhattan Bank, are also the insurance companies Metropolitan Life 
Insurance and Equitable Life Insurance. The operations of these companies 
are extremely varied -- from the renting of railroad cars, to machinations 
ruining farmers of the South Who have been obliged to mortgage their lands. 
The Rockefellers make profit also on the daily needs of Americans. 
If an American smokes a cigarette, bays a sandwich or a package of meat, 
or drinks a glass of Coca-Cola, he increases the wealth of the "oil king" 
of America. Many other trusts and concerns in the USA are linked to the 
throne of the "oil king" with a dollar chain. They all serve one and the 
same goal of the uncrowned autocrats of America -- unrestrained profit 
through the exploitation, robbery, and deceit of the workers. 
1 
Bow did the dynasty of the "oil kings" arise? What does it represent? 
Where did its infinite wealth dome from? Why does it -- together with a 
little group of other oligarchs of Wall Street -- rale America, and propel 
the affiars of the capitalist world? 
The founder of the dynasty, John Davison Rockefeller I, at one time 
a government clerk, and later a cashier in a private firm, always --
accordineto his own admission -- thirsted "to make money." Much later 
When the income of this oil magnate exceeded the fortune of the English 
royal family, he said to reporters, "I believe that the capacity to make 
money is a gift from above, like a capability in art, music, or litera-
ture... Being gifted with this capacity, I consider it my duty to make 
more and more money..." 
* * * 
In 1859, the first oil. well was drilled in the USA. Soon after this, 
Rockefeller organized the Standard Oil Company in the state of Ohio. A 
monopolistic position in the oil business, securing for him the title of 
"oil king," did not come at once. It was brought about by the cold-
blooded ruining of rivals and competitors, by money-grabbing which had 
become the purpose of life, by the ability to profit from the labor of

others. By the time Rockefeller had become the first billionaire in the 
world, an entire clique of "robber barons" had become firmly consolidated 
behind him. That clique follows the Rockefellers from generation to 
generation, 
John Davison Rockefeller Jr. resembles his father not only in name, 
but also in habit. Be persistently continnes to multiply the Rockefeller 
capital. 
In the bitter struggle for profitable economic positions, the un-
crowned autocrats of America are guided by the laws of the jangles the 
victor devours the vanquished.. In Wall Street such means of destroying 
competitors is diffidently called "merger." The bloodless but cruel 
struggle among the monopolies of the US does not cease for an instant. 
The journal Fortune, organ of American large capital, wrote in November 
1954 that there takes place in the USA on the average of 45 mergers of 
American industrial concerns per month, and that annually dozens of small 
companies are engulfed by larger competitors in the country. 
In recent years, the Rodkefellers and the groups connected with them 
have considerably expanded their positions at the expense of Morgan, 
their most da.ngerous rival and competitor. 
In economics -- writes V. Perlo, an expert on the American monopolies, 
in his new book The Empire of Large Finance Capital, published. in Naw York 
in August 1957 -- this displacement is related to the flourishing of the 
oil oartel, and its conversion into the largest, ruling source of profits 
in the world. In politics, this displacement is associated with the con-
version of the government of the USA into the most militarized aad geo-
graphically expansionist force, as a new, disguised form of colonial 
empire. 
While half a century ago the steel trusts (Morgan) possessed 30.8 
percent of all the capital of the 100 largest trusts aad concerns of the 
US, and the oil trusts (Rockefeller) only 7.4 percent, forty years later 
28 percent of the capital has already become the share of the oil com-
panies, and 11.9 percent that of steel. In 1954, reckoned among the 
largest concerns of the US were 14 oil concerns with a total capital of 
23 billion dollars, 8 steel-processing concerns (capital of 9 billion 
dollars), three automobile (8 billion) and six chemical (5.5 billion 
dollars). 
The growth of the capital of the Rockefeller group is accompanied by 
a strengthening of its political influence. Its henchmen and emissaries 
now rale in the high governmental apparatus of the US. But the Morgans 
do not intend to yield their positions without a battle. Experts on the 
American monopolies predict new, bitter encounters between these largest 
monopolistic oligarchies of the US,

In 1967, the Rockefeller oligarchy of American oil industrialists 
controlled a capital of 61.4 billion dollars. The precise size of the 
Rockefeller fortune is a state secret of America; the American press . 
noted at one time that special measures are taken so that data concerning 
the largest fortunes of the US are not published. 
; The,Rockefellers do not buy yachts worth many millions, like the 
Vanderbilt magnates; they do not install doorknobs and water faucets of 
pure gold in their palaces. But love for luxury is not alien to them. 
The play house where the Children of the Rodkefellers frolic cost a half 
million dollars. Bourgeois newspapers, willingly "forgetting" about such 
"trifles," relate with tears of sympathy how the children of the billionaire 
earn pocket money by raising rabbits, cleaning boots, and even by destroying 
flies at ten cents per hundred. 
The Rodkefellers do not like to speak of their capital. But no one 
hap long since believed the words of Rockefeller the elder, "God gave 
me money." The people want to know the truth. And the truth about the 
wealth of the Rockefellers consists of dark deeds, thousands of rained 
families, hundreds of thousands of workers in many countries of the world 
tormented by work beyond their strength. The truth is the concealed history 
of many wars -- it is oil stained with blood. 
John Do Rockefeller II does not direct his wide empire along. He has 
five sons -- John D. III, Lawrence, David, Winthrop, and Nelson. They 
are all large capitalists. Each has his role, his department. Only 
Winthrop has not become famous for anything, unless one counts a scandalous 
divorce case. 
The task of John III is to personify the imaginery "philanthropists" 
of the family. Bourgeois newspapers paint him as the embodiment of 
"modesty" and even "shyness." So that he may consolidate his reputation 
for "philanthropy," John III heads a council of guardians of a Rockefeller 
philanthropic fund- From time to time he is entrusted with more responsible 
missions. 
Not as a tourist, bat as a very large creditor, John D. III was 
present in the American delegation at the signing of the San Francisco 
treaty with Japan; it is evident that this country is enveloped by a net-
work of branches of the Chase Manhattan Bank. 
Lawrence Rockefeller, a middle-aged gentleman with a square beard, 
is well-known at the. New York Stock Exchange. He is one of the directors 
of the Chase Manhattan Bank. 
In this same bank, in the capacity of a vice president, the fourth 
offspring, David is striving. Behind the concrete walls of the bank the 
Rockefeller brothers jealously guard the interests of their oil dynasty.

David Rockefeller directs the international operations of this bank, 
The bourgeois press advertises him as the owner of the best collection 
of insects in the world, and as possessing extremely gentlemanlymanners. 
But When he enters the office of the bank and the steel doors close behind 
his back, the lover of butterflies turns into a greedy seeker after dollars. 
The hired biographers have every basis for calling him "the personifica-
tion of the virtues of Wall Street." 
The American press advertises Nelson, the fifth and most active of 
the young Rockefellers, as an "entrepreneur of aalture" and a "patron of 
the muses". He is one of the directors of the Museum of Modern Art in 
New York. But considerably better known is his activity in the diplomatic 
field. Included in the American delegation to the conference organizing 
the UN in San Francisco in 1945, he did everything, even then, to worsen 
relations between the USA and the USSR. When former US President Traman 
proclaimed the notorious "four point" program, with its purpose of 
strengthening the penetration of American capital into the colonial and 
dependent countries, Nelson Rockefeller became a leader of the government 
organ to carry out this program. Should one be surprised at the fact 
that the Rockefeller bank held first place on the list of 54 American 
banks which received financial jobs from the government for US operations 
abroad? 
Half of all private foreign capital investments made after the Second 
Wbrld,Wkr have long been those of the American oil companies. In 1953, 
more than half of all foreign profits received by American private? in-
vestors entered the safes of the oil companies. This, of course, to a 
considerable degree has been the1 doing of that same Nelson Rockefeller. 
The Rockefellers have long nourished an irresistible attraction for 
the countries of Latin America: the provocatory smell of oil reaches 
them from the South American continent. Therefore, Nelson Rockefeller, 
who had long been trying to turn South America into his family estate, 
was at one time placed at the head of the so-called "Bureau of Inter-
American Affairs." 
For a long time Nelson Rockefeller held the post of special assistant 
to the President for foreign policy matters. He took part in cabinet 
meetings and meetings of the most important US government organ, the 
National Security Council. This council works out and directs the entire 
policy of the United States. 
,Nelson is not the only "arm" of the oil magnates in the American 
government.

henchman of the "oil king." At his order, a court suit against the oil 
monopolies of the US, accused of violating the Sherman Antitrust Act, was

discontinued., Brownell has labored much to unleash, in the Gauntry, 
baiting of the Communist Party and of many progressive and liberal or-
ganizations in the USA. 
Lewis D. Straus,the head of the Atomic Energy Commission, is a 
financial adviser and director of tbe "Rockefeller Brothers" firm, 
John Foster Dulles, who holds the post of U. S. Secretary of State, 
is a co-partner in the law firm of Sullivan and Cromwell. That firm has 
long upecialized in defending the interests of the largest monopolies of 
WaIl Street in general, and of the "oil king" of America in particular. 
And can it be otherwise? It is evident that John Poster Dulles was at 
one time, 4 member of the board of Rockefeller's Standard Oil of New 
Jersey,. The attractionof.the post of Secretary of State (Minister of 
Foreign Affairs) for the Rockefellers is understandable. This post makes 
it possible for them to interfere in the foreign policy of the USA, to 
give it the direction necessary for them. Edwin Johnson, a senator from 
the state of Colorado, indeed declared in 1947 in Congress that the 
' oil companies of the US are making broad use of the State Department to 
obtain oil concessions in the Middle East. 
"The policy of the State Department," the newspaper Daily Compass  
wrote in this regard several years ago, "is born in the offices of 
Standard,Oil. Prom .there it Is transmitted to the Department of Defense, 
Where the_heads of the Army and Navy approve it. When this policy gets

oil kings comes from the Rockefeller dynasty itself, the entire Congresss 
from the small to the great -- comes to "attention" and does what the 
bosses order it to do." 
Recently Senator 0?Mahoney confirmed this impartial truth about 
America. With the purpose of placing his rivals -- the Republicans --
in an unfavorable light, 0?Mahoney, a representative of the Democratic 
Party in Congress, undertook an investigation of the influence of the US 
monopolies on the foreign policy of the country. On 22 February 1957 
he made an extremely eloquent statement to a correspondent of one of the 
newspaper trusts of America, the essence of which amounted to an admis-
siOn,Of 0,0 40,0 that the: large oil companies of the USA determineUS 
policy in the Near East. 
The Senator related, for example, that on 13 August 1956, that is, 
three days before the start of the London meeting on the Suez question, 
Secretary of State Dulles and his assistant at that time, R. Hoover Jr, 
consulted in the State Department in Washington with representatives of 
the large, American oil companies on the position of the USA at the meeting 
in London, _Dulles gave, at this consultation, firm guarantees that the

interests of these companies would determine the policy of the State 
Department in the Suez question. Present at the consultation were 
representatives of Rockefeller 's Standard Oil of New Jersey, ARAMOO, 
Standard Oil of California,, and others. In his conversation with the 
correspondent, 00Mahoney was obliged to admit the existence of "a close 
alliance between the leaders of the oil corporations that operate in the 
Middle East and the State Department in carrying out foreign policy in 
this region."

- In recent years the Rockefellers have been taking hold of ever newer 
sources of oil. Rockefeller's oil companies are unceremoniously crowding 
out their English colleagaes in the Near East. They have already deprived 
them of domination in the extraction of Near Eastern oil. 
The heavy hand of the "oil king" of America is also stretched over 
the French possessions in Africa. When, in; 1949, representatives of the 
largest American banks created a special committee for the "stimulation 
and facilitation of the development of the overseas territories of France," 
Winthrop Aldrich, a close relative of John D. Rockefeller Jr., was at 
the head of the committee. In subsequent years the Rockefellers have 
taken over one more important post -- that of Ambassador to England, rep-
resented by that same Aldrich, Who was replaced in this post by another 
henchman of the Rodkefellers, D. H. Whitney. Before Aldrich, this post 
was held by 7,Leis - Douglas,, a representative of Morgan. 
,The "oil king" is consolidating his rale in Latin America, from 
whence the USA receives up to ninety percent of its oil imports. In 
Venezuela alone, almost three-fourths of the extracted oil belongs to 
Americans, Who have obtained almost a billion dollars in profit there 
in six years. The Rodkefellers are strengthening their penetration into 
West Germany. The share of American capital in the extraction of oil 
in that country reached 62 percent in 1950. In the year 1951 alone, 
American capital in the oil industry of West Germany amounted to 172 
million marks. The capital of the Rockefeller companies also plays a 
significant tole in the oil industry of Japan. 
One of the basic methods of knocking out profits used by the Rodke-
fellers is that of openly predatory speculation. Here is an examples 
the net cost of one barrel of oil in the countries of the Near East does 
not exceed ten cents; in the USA it amounts to about 80 cents. The oil 
is sold, however, at a price of $1.75 per barrel. This makes it possible 
for the oil profiteers to put hundreds of millions of dollars into their 
'pockets annually. The one oil company of ARAMCO alone, in Arabia, 
received about 425 million dollars of profit in 1952, or about 1.4 dollars 
of profit from each barrel of oil. This is undisguised robbery, not only 
of the countries of the Near and Middle East, Where the Rockefellers obtain 
the free oil, bat also of the European countries, where the oil monopolists 
supply oil at fabulous prices.

The oligarchy of oil industrialists is continually perfecting the 
process of squeezing out profits. In enterprises of Rockefeller's 
ARAMCO, less than two percent of the amount received from the sale of 
oil goes for the wages of the workers. In Venezuela, Standard Oil pays 
the oil workers five times less than workers in the USA. Therefore its 
profits per company worker in Venezuela are over four times greater 
than those in the USA. 
At one time, when seeking a confidential assistant for himself, 
John D. Rockefeller I cynically declared that he needed a man capable 
of "ruining thousands of families." "In one word," he boastfully added, 
"I am seeking a second Rockefeller." It is difficult to define the 
predatory essence of capitalism more precisely and more cynically. 
The American people hate the plunderer billionaires. The Rocke-
fellers know this and fear the people's anger. Therefore, they spend 
enormOus sums on special advertising agents- The capitalist press 
assidnously spreads the myth of the Rockefellers as benefactors. The 
bourgeois press depicts with tears of compassion the sacrifices of the 
"oil king" for philanthropic purposes. They speak, write, and all bit 
sing songs in the US about the Rockefeller "philanthropic funds." Bat 
the motives of the ostentatious Rockefeller "unselfiShness" are extremely 
selfieh The dynasties of the "oil kings" are annoyed by taxes on their 
doldasal profits. Moreover, in the USA, inheritance taxes also exist. 
And lo, the inventive lawyers of the monopolies found a way out for their 
bosses. They proposed to create a philanthropic fund, free of taxes. 
This hypocritical artifice of the "oil king" has evoked a storm of praise 
in the corrupt press. 
The Rockefeller "philanthropic fund" is nothing other than his own 
purse, in Which the "oil king" can keep part of his capital without paying 
taxes. 
The money in the fund is managed by a "council of trustees" con, 
slating of representatives of the largest monopolies -- mainly Rocke-
feller's. Among them are John McCloy, former American High Commissioner 
in West Germany, Robert Lovett, former Secretary of Defense, and others. 
In 1950 John Foster. Dulles, Who had been a member of this council since 
1926, became chairman of the "council of trustees". Row heading the fund 
is the oldest son of the "oil king" of America. 
Out of the Rookefellers' philanthropic fund are financed jobs involving 
the creation of new types of armament. The "oil, kings" display special 
interest in the atomic bomb. "Without the aid of Rockefeller," the magazine 
Colliers wrote in 1951, "the United States would have been without the 
atomic bomb daring the second world war or even now." As the American 
press has stated, the most important research connected with the creation 
of the atomic weapon was conducted at Columbia, Princeton, and other

American universities, financed by Rockefeller. At California University, 
work on the splitting of the atom was conducted with Rockefelleris money. 
According to the-testimony of Colliers, an important discovery in the 
field of the atomic weapon was made at Chicago University, which was 
founded by Rockefeller and which received considerable swine from him 
for work in the field Of atomic weapons. 
In 1950, John D. Rockefeller II travelled to West Germany for negotia-
tions with the German concern I. G. Farben Industrie on drawing up a con-
tract; for research in the field of atomic energy. In 1953, the Rockefellers 
bought up the stock of the largest uranium mines in the Belgian Congo. 
Hidden behind the payments from the philanthropic Rockefeller fund 
into the tills of the universities, are avaricious calculations. With 
the aid of these payments, the system of higher education is subordinated 
to the interests of large capital. 
The Rockefellers display considerable interest in higher educational 
institutions. Within their walls, the Wall Street moneybags Want to train 
for themselves servants of monopolistic capital. For this, they name 
their own representatives as "trustees" of the universities. 
"The trustees," it is said in the Charter of Columbia University, 
"always keep complete authority in the field of the direction and guidance 
of the entire educational process.. They choose the president of the 
university...they name the professors and teachers..." 
Columbia University in New York has long enjoyed donations from the 
Rockefellers. Its "trustees" are henchmen of the "oil king": Thomas 
Parkinson, the president of the Rockefeller insurance firm EquitabI&Life 
Insurance, and Marcellus Hartley Dodge, son-in-law of the "oil king" and 
the chairman of the board of directors of the military concern, Remington 
Arms Company. 
An object of special concern for the Rockefellers is the 86-Called 
Russian Institute of Columbia University, created in 1946. This "educe, 
tional institution" has an extremely distant relation with science and 
education. It is characterizedby the closest ties with the intelligence 
organs of the State Department, for which the "institute" prepares cadres 
of "specialists on Russia." The overwhelming majority of the students 
of the "Russian Institute" are officials of the State Department, cadets 
of the military school at West Point, and students of the naval academy. 
Since the "institute" was created, its director has been Gerold 
Robinson, a "specialist on Russian affairs". During the war, Robinson 
was chief of the "Russian section" of strategic intelligence of the 
American Army. Under his direction, there worked: in: the "Ruesian Institute"

Through AHAMOO in Arabia he supplies the so-called "school of eastern 
studies" in Jerusalem with money. In this "school" American officers are

and the same chain -- the preparation of a new war of the monopolies 
against the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism,

*-* * 
The first fortune of.Rodkefeller, the "oil king," was occasioned by 
the war ,boom evoked by the civil war in UK, USA. 
The first world war brought Standard Oil unheard-of profits. 
After the end of this bloody slaughter, the dollars of the "oil 
king," like those of other American monopolies, facilitated the revival 
of the Germany war machine and its preparation of the second world war, 
Rockefeller's Standard Oil had long been connected with the German con,-
cernj, G. Farben Industrie', which reared Eitlerism, that monstrous 
offspring of German imperialism. Without this industry of the weapons 
of war, faec145.74. aggression Wad have been impossible. I. G. Farben 
Iu-
dustrie filled Eitler's shells with TNT, supplied mechanized and air 
force units with rubber and fuel, and finally, supplied the poison gases 
for the mass .murders of people in the camps of death ?Auschwitz and 
Majdanek. This concern was the only producer of synthetic rubber and 
gasoline in the country; in its factories 95 percent of the German 
poison gas and 84 percent of the explosives were produced. 
The Standard Oil Company was an ally and partner of I. G. Farben 
Industrie._ The cartel agreement of 1938 concluded between them granted 
I. G. Farb= Industrie the opportunity to create enormous reserves of 
aviation gasoline for, the war being prepared by German imperialism. In 
addition, this agreement granted I. G. Farben Industrie a share in the 
profits from the production of aviation gasoline in the USA. 
T#0 Second World War did not break these cartel ties, it only 
temporarily weakened them, drove them underground. Thanks to them, the 
Hitlerites received secret technical information from the USA even during 
the war, and with the aid of their agents in South America, they bought 
aviation gasoline from Standard Oil. 
It is not surprising that only two out of the 55 enterprises of 
I. G. Farben Industrie ouffere4 from the Anglo-.American bombings.

? While the people's of the world were celebrating the victory over ' 
fascism, alarm was ruling in Wall Street; a threat to the enormous profits 
of wartime had arisen. 
But the New York stock profiteers did not intend to give Up their 
fabulaue profits. The "cold war" was one of the main factors of profit. 
The AmeriCan oil co4anies received over four and a half billion dollars 
in'profits in the very first years of the cold war. :Half of these profits 
were the share of the Rockefeller concerns. Dollars flowed in a still 
broader stream into the safes of the "oil king" after the start of the 
war in Korea. 
By as early as the first quarter of 1951, the profits of 23 oil 
companies of the US had risen one and a half times. The cessation of the 
Korean War did not stop the stream of profits -- it was evident that the 
arMs rade continued With unrelenting force. And while, during the last 
year of the iar in Korea, the profits of Rockefeller ?9 Standard Oil 
reached a hitherto unprecedented level -- 553 million dollars, in 1955 
the profits topped 700 million dollars, and they continue to grow. 
HThe EoCketellers are once again profiting from the arms race from 
war 'preparations. 
-The bloody events in the Near East in the fall of 1956, the war 
against Egypt begun by England,' France and Israel with the silent protec-
tion and secret instigation of the US monopolies, brought new profits 
to the American oil monopolies. In February 1957, Rathbone, president of 
RoCkefelleres Standard. Oil of New Jersey, told a committee of Congress 
that the increase in oil prices evoked by the Suez crisis Would increase 
the profits of the American oil companies by 100 million dollars in 1957, 
would bring those profits up to a fabulous gam -- 900 million dollars 
This, it appears, was Why the houses of Port Said burned, why the blood 
of Arab women and children was spi1led1 
* * * 
,Now much ink has been spilled by the propagandists of the American 
monopolies in attempts to assure the entire world that American "aid" is 
rendered "unselfishly" to the countries receiving it, with the only purpose 
being that of facilitating a raise in the standard of living of their 
peoples. But then in February 1957 a secret letter of Nelson Rockefeller, 
one of the representatives of the dynasty of the "oil kings" of the US, 
became the property of world public opinion; Rockefeller, to this day, 
enjoys great influence in the White Nouse. In this letter, 4 broad program 
is set forth for the use of the so-called economic "aid" of the USA for 
the political and military enslavement of underdeveloped countries by 
American imperialism.

With the ultimate in cynicism, the "oil king" of the US proposes a 
"total" foreign policy Which would unite political, psychological, economic, 
military, and special methods into one Whole. The author cites Iran as an 
example of the application of such methods. "By rendering economic aid," 
he writes, "we have succeeded in obtaining access to Iranian oil, and 
now we have already firmly consolidated ourselves in the economy of this 
country. Consolidation of our economic positions in Iran has made it 
possible for us to place its entire foreign policy under control, and, in 
particular, to persuade Iran to enter the Bagdad Pact." 
Nelson Rockefeller calls for a strengthening of American military 
alliances with the help of a "large program of economic development."... 
basic _part of our (that is, US -- 0. F.) economic aid," he declares,

serve thaeagse_of our military alliances." The Rockefeller program sets 
forth a plan .for. the utilization of private capital investments with the 
purpose of securing the political rale of the USA in the countries 
receiving aid.. For what ;reason? 
In order, it is said in Rockefeller' s letter, that "the development 
of economic, relations with these countries" may give the USA "the oppor-
tunity to take into its own hands the key positions in the economies of 
these countries." This is where the plans for imperialist enslavement 
of the !landerdeVeloped" states, for their subordination to the mercenary 
Interests of the ,monopolies of the. US, for their plundering by the in-
satiable 04 trgets and other trusts of the United States of America 
originate. .The,etruggle against these plans of the imperialist monopo-
lies is an important part of the straggle against a new world war, which 
is being prepared by the American magnates of capital.

When the advertising agents of theDul'ont family of billionaires 
want to demonstrate the might of this dynasty, they relate how once 
US President F. Roosevelt, in one of his personal meetings with Irenee 
Du Paot, invited him to visit the White House. "This invitation was never 
accepted," the magazine The Saturday Evening Post, an organ of large US 
capital, wrote subsequently, not without self-satisfaction. 
The American press breathlessly describes the luxurious estates of 
the DuPont, scattered throughout the territory of the state of Delaware, 
which has _long been nicknamed in the US as the_"dukedom of the Du Pont." 
More than a, few newspaper and magazine pages have been devoted to a 
description of the fabulous estate of the Du Pouts, "Longwood," located 
on the ,outskirts of Wilmington.

This, as the biographers of theDU.Ponts testify, in a medieval 
castle, surrounded by a thousand acres of attentively cultivated land. 
In the greenhouses of"Longwooduare grown all year round oranges, lemons, 
peaches, and also all possible sorts of exotic fruits. The owner of the 
estate dare?or his greenhouses: during the 1930s he spent $25,000 for 
one cultivated bash alone, which was supplied teLongwooe.. 
Besidestongwoog Which, according to careful estimates of investi-
gators of the American way of life, is valued at about fifteen million 
dollars, another 23 suburban castles of theDu Ponts are located near 
Wilmington. 
? Each 9f them is famous for its sights. At "Nemur," the residence 
of Henry I. [llenryFianpia?] DuPont, fo,r example, there esepld at taken at one time 
from the. medieval English estate of Wimbleton. Here, too, there are 
luxurious gardens, located. below the level of the sea... 
The state of Delaware is called the "dukedom of theDu Pants" pot 
only because the estates of theDu.Ponts exceed, in their magnificence, 
the castles of medieval feudal lords. This state is in essence their 
feudal dominion. TheDu Pontshere own everything: schools, hospitals, 
bridges and roads. The local newspapers belong to them, the courts and 
the authorities of the state serve them. They establish the rules that 
are suitable to them. TheDu Pontshere are masters in the full meaning 
of this word. Their luxurious palaces, valued at 150 million dollars, 
are only insignificant grains of sand in the sea of their wealth. The 
capital controlled by theDu Pont oligarchy now amounts to 16 billion 
dollars. 
Their power -- the power of the dollar -- extends far beyond the 
boundaries of the state of Delaware, and even beyond the boundaries of 
America. 
Back in 1934, John Jacob Rascob, the chief assistant of Pierre S. 
Du Por4Ithe owner oftongwood: boasted: "TheDra Pont group, with the aid 
of joint-stock capital, controls a larger share of industry than any 
other group in the US. Not one of the groups, including those of Rocke-
feller, Morgan, Mellon, or any other, controls industry on such a scale 
or bears such responsibility for it as does theDu Pont company." 
Since that time, more than twenty years have passed. Daring those 
years the might of theDu.Pont group has grown still farther. They can 
rightfully be called the kings of American Chemistry and automobile 
,building.

At the present time, three enormous monopolistic associations of the 
US are under the control of the Du Fonts; the gigantic chemical concern 
Du.P.0.3b, de Nemours, the United States Rubber Company, and the largest 
military-industrial enterprise of the capitalist world, General Motors 
Corporation. In order to disguise their control over these associations, 
the Du yonts have created the holding companies, Christiana Securities and 
Delaware Trust. All the stock in them belong to the Du Potts themselves 
or to members of their enormous family. 
Formally, the concerns Du Pont de Nemours, United States Rubber, and 
General Motors are also joint stock enterprises, that is, any businessman 
can participate in them with his capital. However, in fact all power in 
the boards of these companies belongs to the Du Ponts. It is sufficient 
for these gentlemen, for example, to own 17 percent of the stock of 
United States Rubber Company, in order to dictate their will within the 
company, since all the other stock is distributed -- more accurately, 
atomized -- among 14,000 small stock-traders and other lovers of profit... 
The Du.Pontos have turned the companies controlled by them into markets 
for the sale of their own products. They compel United States Rubber, for 
example, to buy raw material from the concern E. I. Du Pont de Nemours. 
It stands to reason that the prices for that raw material are established 
by the Du pOnts themselves. Part of the production of United States Rubber 
is sold to General Motors, and the Du Polite again dictate the prices in 
just #10.same way. And those who acquire the products -- the consumers --
pay for these prices. Thus enormous profits grow, permitting the Du Pouts 
as they admitted in the advertising brochure This isDu Pont, which they 
published for the stockholders -- to subsidize its own expansion." 
For the sake of what is this unending expansion carried out? For 
the sake of what is the artful mechanism of the stocks established, the 
complex, disguised control of the holding and stock companies, the 
lowered and increased prices, the hidden monopolistic market? What is 
the moving force of the growth of the industrial empire of theDu Ponts? 
In the. same brochure, This isDu Pont, they themselves answer this question; 
"The impelling motive..., without doubt, is the attractive force of profits." 
The force of profits. TheDu Pants do not exist in order to grow 
peaches in the state of Delaware. The meaning of their existence is in 
the incessant chase after profits. 
With the Du Ponta, everything is subordinated to an increase in 
profits. In the enterprises of Du Pont de Nemours and United States Rubber, 
a bestial speed-up system is established. This is that scientific system 
of "squeezing out the sweat" from the worker about which V. I. Lenin wrote 
with such anger; but a system still more highly perfected, carried to

genuine fanaticism. While in 1929 the worker in the DU,Tont concern 
produced, in a nine-hour working day, 250 pounds of zinc Paint, now, 
a shorter time," his production -- 3,000 pounds -- is twelve times 
greater. And at enterprises of General Motors, according to the testimony 
of the American trade-union press, the conveyors are moved at such speed 
that people often faint away and die at the conveyor. But what is a man 
to theDu, Ponts They count profits... And the profits of General Motors. 
grow with every passing year, with every day. While, for example, in 
1954 profits had grown to the fabulous sum of 806 million dollars, in 
1955 they reached figures never been seen in the hist ry of the American 
monopolies -- more than one billion dollars. The Du. Ponts had. exceeded 
themselves. 
r 
In. their unquenchable thirst for profits, theDu Ponts do not content 
themselves with the exploitation of the American workers chained by need 
to the conveyor belts. People work for them also in Canada, where their 
firm. E., I.Du Pont de Eemaurs owns enterprises that extract pyrites; in 
Mexico; and. in Chili, where enterprises of the processing industry belong 
to theR9' The. . Ponts have plants in. Argentina and Brazil. Du Pontls 
General Motors directly or indirectly controls 36 branch companies abroad. 
Among them are the plants of the "Opel-Werke" company in West Germany, 
and the "Velox," rTalden," and "Wevern" automobile plants in England. 
Du 1,9TA! )!Futt 04 ,States Rubber Company has branches in. Argentina, Columbia, 
Vener1,44 Scotland, Cuba, and Mexico. Rubber plantations on Sumatra 
and in Naive belong to it. The press calculated one day that about one 
million !/91*Prs in various parts of the world work for the enrichment 
of the Du Ponts. 
* * * 
In America they call the Du Ponts the "hereditary merchants of 
death." And indeed, the greatest profits are brought to them by death, 
destruction, and wars. It was precisely due to war orders during the 
period of the First World War that the compankyDu. Pont de Nemours was 
turned from. a comparatively small dynamite and gunpowder firm into one 
of the gigantic world trusts. The enormous profits realized by the 
DpPontedurizig the First World War permitted them to own General Motors 
from the beginning, and then, also, the United States Rubber Company. 
If the income of the Du T'onts during the period of the First World 
Wax was enormous, then the profits they acquired during the Second World 
War,were fabulous.. DuFing the years of. the First World War the entire 
turnover of theDu,.Pont dynamite and gunpowder concern amounted to a 
billion,dollars. During:the years of the Second %rid. War, just one of 
theDu I3.ont concerns General Motors -- received war orders of 14.6 
billion dollars from the US government.

Reared by war, the Du Pontsfear peace. If several years of the 
postwar peace were "lost years" for the kings of dynamite and gunpowder, 
they cheered up in 1950, when the war began in Korea. Orders worth 
billions at once flowed into the bulky safes of the owners of General 
Motors; during the years of the Korean war that concern received some 
seven billion dollars in war orders. Behind these dry figures was the 
roar of the motors of American bombers over peaceful Korean cities, and 
the thousands of tons of deadly load thrown down by them upon the heads 
of women, old men, and children. 
The name of the Du Pouts is inseparably connected with the most 
sinister activity of4.merican monopolistic capital -- with the produc-
tion of American atomic and hydrogen weapons. The Du Pont gentlemen with 
light hearts profit by many millions of dollars from this black business. 
No one but the Du Fonts was given the task of building the first 
complex American atomic enterprises for the production of plutonium in 
Hanford (state of Washington), enterprises Which were subsequently 
transferred to the Morgans. The main atomic plant at Oak Ridge (state 
of Tennessee), where the atomic bombs are produced, was also built 
precisely by theDu Pouts' concern. When Truman gave an order to the 
Atomic Energy Commission in 1950 to begin creating hydrogen bombs, the 
Du Pomba once again were right on the spot. The commission immediately 
concluded a contract with them entrusting them with the construction of 
a plant for the production of deutertum (a constituent part of the hydro-
gen bomb) at the Savannah River (state of South Carolina). The rulers 
of the US knew to Whom to entrust this black business. 
* * * 
In order to direct the policy of the government along paths 
profitable to themselves, the monopolies need state power. Together 
with the other oligarchic groups of US finance capital, the Du Ponts 
guarantee themselves ruling positions in the apparatus of state adminis-
tration of the USA. They maintain close ties with the ruling hierarchy 
of the Republican party, making large contributions to its treasury during 
the period of election campaigns. Thus securing for themselves decisive 
influence in the leadership of this party, the Du Ponts send their direct 
agents and henchmen into the apparatus of state administration of the US. 
Representatives of the Du Pont concerns hold cabinet posts in the 
government of the US. The policy of the Du Pont henchmen in the government 
is fully subordinated to the interests of the industrial and financial 
oligarchy, as well as to the interests of US monopolistic capital as a 
whole.

It is therefore not difficult to understand why the USA so per-
sistently, opposes the redaction of armaments and armed forces, the 
banning of the production, testing and use of weapons of mass destruction. 
It is evident that tanks, planes, and nuclear weapons are business for 
the American monopolies. The Du Fonts are assigned an honored place in 
the general staff of the American monopolies -- the National Association 
of Manufacturers. LammotDu Pont has long been a vice-president of this 
association. The representatives of theDu.Ponts belong to many of the 
secret organizations of large capital, rendering determining influence 
on the course of state administration in the country. 
At one time, one of the committees of the Senate, under the pressure 
of the indignant public opinion of America, published data on the secret 
forces of Wall Street that finance the most reactionary organizations 
of the US -- the "League of Freedom," the "Crusaders," the "Defenders 
of the Eepublic," the "Economic Council of the State of New York," and 
others. /t appeared that out of about one million dollars paid into the 
funds of these organizations by the largest industrialists and bankers 
of America, 356,000 was the contribution of theDu.Ponts and their agents. 
TheDulponts rale in the so-called "National Economic Council," Which is 
occupied with reactionary propaganda and with active secret activity in 
circles of the US Congress. It is precisely that organization Which 
strives for the adoption of the arch-reactionary bills aimed at under-
mining and destroying the trade unions and the organized labor movement 
in the United States of America. 
TheDu Ponts. finance the American Legion, out of Whose.ranks the 
monopolies of Wall Street prepare American storm troopers to make Short 
shrift of progressive workers organizations and trade unions. The 
kings of the dynamite and atom business do not stint their dollars 
it is evident that in these detachments of American reaction they see 
one of the chief means of suppressing the democratic forces of the 
American people. 
Like the other magnates of large US capital, theDu.Ponts fear that 
the truth about the activity of their concerns will reach the common 
people, arousing anger and indignation in them. Therefore, they hire 
dozens of paid journalists, commentators and writers to spread myths 
and legends about their "philanthropy," "kindness," and "sympathy," 
At one time a tearful legend made the rounds of the American press 
about how a certain feeble old woman hobbled up totongwoodt the estate 
of the Du, Ponts, and, turning, at the entrance of the park, to an old man 
whom she. took for a gardener, asked him to dhow her the strange plants. 
This little old man supposedly seated the old woman in a mobile armchair 
and wheeled her for several hours around the lanes of the park, telling 
her all sorts of facts and fables about the Du_Pottorchids, rhododendrons, 
palms and cacti. The legend had it that the inquisitive old woman thus

did not recognize that the master of the castle, Pierre S. Du Pont, was 
wheeling her around the lanes. If the old woman had come to the gates 
of the hydrogen weapon plant at the Savannah River, a few minutes would 
have been enough for her to understand who and what the Du Portgentlemen 
are. 
Plunderer First Class 
:A Gigantic Octopus 
M. Andreyev 
A swift elevator noiselessly lifted the correspondent of Time 
magazine to the fourteenth floor of a large, glass and metal building 
located on the Great West Boulevard of Detroit. On the massive front 
supported by marble columns glittered the name "General Motors." The 
.correspondent enteTed a large, carpeted room finished in oak paneling. 
On a wall beside a writing table hangs the photograph of the President 
of the United States, animatedly conversing with Curtis, the president 
of General Motors. Alongside it hangs a comical drawing in which a 
father, seated in a chair, is telling a seven-year-old tomboy-son of 
"the great and free country of America" Where "anyone can become 
president." "I do not want to be.president of the United States" 
answers the,boy. "I want to become president of General Motors." 
Viewing this room, the correspondent experienced mixed feelings 
of usual respect, apprehension, and pride. Apprehension would not 
please the man who heads the largest concern in the world, nor would 
pride of one's missions. The correspondent was sent to interview 
Curtis, whom Time selected as "the most outstanding man of 19550 from 
among hundreds of other honorable buslnessmen. 
The interview was Short. The president of General Motors or GM, 
as this concern is familiarly and at the same time respectfully called 
in the United States, was Short-spoken. It was not necessary for him to 
persuade Or convince the representative of the press. Henry Luce, pub-
lisher,ofliat and other journals, himself a great businessman, not only 
does not tolerate that his brother in business and class be spoken of 
disrespectfully in the press, but even takes steps in order that all 
Which Curtis says and has in mind to pay is published on the pages of 
his magazine in a most favorable light. In addition, and this is 
paramount, both Curtis and the correspondent know well that profite of 
American newspapers and magazines from advertisements are significantly 
greater than from subscriptions. More than $30 million is received each 
year from General Motors alone for this purpose. Advertising is the 
motive, power of trade, the straitjacket and means of bribery of the 
American "free press," which serves as a slave to monopolies including 
the richest Detroit, client, General Motors.

Noweverinot only.Time, but even all organs of the capitalist press of 
the UnAted:States have attempted to whitewash and ennoble the activities 
of American, monopolies in recent years. Not only the press is involved 
in this effort, but also those people who are paid by monopolies to di-
rectly or indirectly represent their interests; government and political 
figures, members of Congress, economists, historians, jurists, and even 
, 
somp,ofthe leader! of American trade unions, Which is not strange. This 
whitewashing is done to conceal from the workers the conversion of American 
monopolies into a gigantic amalgamation and to veil their anti,national 
activities which are becoming even more criminal in nature. 
The blood and deprivation of the nation's masses, the suffering and 
tears cf millions of workers have created these vast monopolistic amalgams, 
tionsand,that invisible slicysoraper in which the "multi-millionaire club" 
is qaartered! Invisible because such an organization does not formally 
exist in the United States. American industrialists, with envy, and the 
people, with Abhorrence, attached the nickname "multi-millionaire club" 
to those,carporations and concerns Which amassed capital exceeding the 
vast plmcf_one billion dollars. 
. ,?., , 
, 40,991 the first malti-millionaire corporation appeared in the 
United States --.Korgan?0 "United States Steel,." which absorbed its com-
petitors including "Carnegie Steel," one of the oldest steel companies. 
Soon after the first world war six malti-millionaire corporations appeared 
.1,mthe United States. 
The second world war and the course of preparing for a new war and 
the militarization of the economy, accompanied by the impudent robbery 
of the AmeriCan,people and the peoples of other countries, gave rise to 
newl,large-scale plunderers. In January 1953, the number of maiti-
milli9naire:concerns rose to 66, and their capital -- to $173.4.billion. 
In 1955 there were 77 multi-millionaire concerns with a capital of $224 
billion. 
P.941,Prel Motors, the largest military-industrial corporation in the 
world entered this "multi-millionaire club." Its capital at the beginning 
of 196.3 was estimated at the astronomical figure of $4 billion. Toward the 
middle of 1956 this had increased to $6.3 billion.

The corporation has 157 plants, of Which more than 30 are abroad. 
The tentacles of this gigantic octopus extend into 20 countries of Europe, 
Latin America, Asia, Africa, including England, West Germany, France, 
Pakistan, Australia, and other countries. In 1955, 624,000 blue and white 
collar workers were employed in its enterprises. In 1941, when the United 
States entered the war, the value of all products sold by this corporation 
was $2.4 billion. In 1955 it reached $12.4 billion and its gross profits 
before deducting taxes were $2.6 billion. For the first time in the 
entire history of the United States this concern earned a pure profit of 
more than one billion dollars, occupying first place among all other 
industrial concerns. 
The largest mechanized transportation concern in the capitalist world, 
General Motors manufactures not only automobiles, but airplanes, powerful 
tractors, airplane engines (including jet engines), railroad diesel 
locomotives, diesel engines for heavy machinery, mechanisms, and naval 
craft, road-building machines (power shovels, scrapers, etc.), mobile 
electric-power stations, refrigerating plants, and refrigerators, etc. 
. , 
The company organized a research group for work in the field of 
atomic energy to Which until recently, only the elect, the largest 
corporations -- plunderers Who jealously guard this golden source of 
enormOUs profits -- were admitted. 
Military orders or "defense" work played and are playing a special 
role in enriching General Motors as well as other large monopolistic 
amalgamations. In the United States this practice is hypocritically 
termed criminal use of the government treasury by monopolies, which is 
made up of the hard-earned pennies of the American people. General 
Motors' d4arg in government military orders during the second world war, 
the Sprean aggression, and the militarization imposed on the American 
people has varied between ten and twenty percent, depending on the proddings 
of its representatives in Washington and the market conditions of its civil-
ian production. 
How did this, concern achieve its wealth and power? Perhaps the 
Curtices andtheir brothers in business actively achieved power and glory 
by persistent, honorable labor and legal means, as corrupt scribblers 
and bourgeois scientific and political figures reiterate? Bourgeois his-
torians and economists, and especially the Curtices themselves have 
reluctantly revealed the secrets of their profit. The entire origin, 
development, and activities of General Motors demonstrate convincingly 
enough that the history of American monopolies is a disgrace and an Un?
broken chain of crimes against the people of the United States and other 
countries.

Spiders in the Bank 
4ung1es, dark jungles, where the strong devour the weak, Where no 
lawaxiits but force -- such is the kingdom of capital. At the end of 
the 19th and the beginning Of the 20th century., imperialism -- monopolistic 
capitalism -- finally matured and the struggle for profit acquired gigantic 
proportions. It became more violent and universal; methods of this struggle 
became more refined. Gigantic monopolies, whose supremacy is the main 
distinguishing feature of the monopolistic stage of capitalism, entered 
the melee. This struggle was led by well-educated but calculating, well-
mannered .but unfeeling, cleanly dressed but with corrupt conscience, 
handsome and at the same time criminal and brutal gentlemen Who comprised 
the aggressive circles of imperialistic countries. 
In the first decade of the 20th century the industrialist William 
Durant waewell-known not only in the closely neighboring cities of 
Detroit and Flint, bat in the district as well. Carriages, vans, coaches, 
and bicycles manufactured in his plants were known far beyond the borders 
of the state of Michigan. The production of railroad cars was an espe-
cially profitable undertaking. During one of the difficult crises Durant 
bought enterprises and shares of his rained competitors cheaply. Unsm, 
ployed European immigrants and negroes from the South consented to work 
for any beggarly wage, Which created very favorable conditions for the 
profit which Durant and his friends were seeking. 
In 1905, exploiting the grievous situation of the Buick Company 
Which, not long before had began to produce automobiles, Durant bought 
its plant in the city of Flint for $10 million. By this time the experi-
enced plunderer began the merciless struggle, typical of monopolies, for 
supremacy in the automobile industry which, though young, still promised 
large profits. The Ford Company barely escaped falling into the traps 
arranged by Durant. Henry Ford was already on the verge of aggressing to 
sell his plant to him for $8 million, but the more cautious bankers, Whose 
capital he controlled, did not support Durant. Together with Ford, Durant 
utterly ruined four other automobile companies; Oldsmobile, Cadillac, 
Norsway, and Oakland. Almagamating them with the Buick company, he 
founded a new concern in 1908 -- General Motors. But When the concernos 
profits achieved considerable proportions, big-shot Detroit bankers came 
to replace the comparatively small plunderer. They acquired his concern 
by unceremoniously chucking out -blirill-starred competitor. 
Many crimes were committed by American businessmen in pursuit of 
profit. But their most terrible crime against mankind was war. During 
this-first world war, Durant became rich. His striving to regain General 
Motors increased proportionately as the profits of this concern grew. 
Durant founded a new automobile company -- Chevrolet, Whose capital before 
the, war reached $94 million, an enormous gam for those times. The straggle 
for General Motors entered a new phase. By enlisting the support of banks

Approved For Release 2001/07/28 : CIA-RDP65-00756R000300270001-9 
associated at this point with the Du Pontplunderers, Durant again acquired 
a portion of the GM Shares by means of various intrigues. Joining to 
these Shares the capital and plants of the Chevrolet company, he stood 
at the head of a mach larger concern, whose capital and profits galloped 
-Sharply upwards during the First World War. However, attracted by the 
prospect of unprecedented profit, still greater plunderers of the dynamite-
powder clan of Du Pontfollowed Durant and General Motors. They lay in 
wait for Darant during one of his shady operations in the jungles of 
big business. Making use of the crisis of 1920, they forced him to sell 
his shares to ,the businessmen of Du Po/Ade Nemours. Owning 23 percent 
of the General Motors shares, they began to dominate this concern. The 
remaining Shares were diaper sed among a great-number of companies and 
individuals. 
Thus did the General Motors monopoly grow fat in the brutal struggle 
with its competitors, swindling, profiteering, resorting to unlawful 
actions, and cruelly exploiting the workers. 
In 1927 its capital was $1,227 million, and in 1956 constituted 
$6.6 billion ($10 billion including branch enterprises). The profits of 
General Motors rose from $154 million to $2.6 billion in 1955. 
With, the growth of the GM coneern?s financial power, the scale of 
its intrigues in the United States and abroad and its impudent inter-
ference in the economic and political life of countries increased. The 
number of companies absorbed and forcibly annexed by General Motors began 
to increase by tens. 
In 1890 the United States Congress passed the so-called Sherman Law, 
supplemented later by "antitrust" laws. But capitalism would cease to 
be capitalism were these laws not constantly violated. Since 1952 the 
large monopolistic sharks swallowed on the average of 800 small companies 
a-P.011.year, ensuring them a dominant position in related industrial fields. 
By ruining, ousting, or subduing other competitors, General Motors now 
became a monopolist in the manufacture of motorized transportation. 
TA 1921, General Motors manufactured 12 percent of all motor vehicles 
produced in the United States. More than 50 percent of this production 
was manufactured by Ford Motors. In addition, there were another 86 
small companies engaged in the manufacture of automobiles. Their share 
[of the total 1921 motor vehicle production] comprised 33 percent. In the 
first half of 1956 General Motors delivered 54 percent of tall] motor 
vehicles. After a desperate fight, Ford was compelled to be satisfied 
with 27 percent, while the small automobile manufacturers ceased to exist. 
General Motors graciously conceded to the activities of three other com-
panies. Nineteen percent of the motor vehicles manufactured in the United 
States remained their Share. They were left only in order that lawyers 
and legal advisers of GM could Jesuitically repudiate the charge of its 
ruined competitors that this octopus-.concern was a monopolist.

The patter of legitimate plundering and destruction of concerns was 
handled in General Motors= one, "scientific basis." A special section 
eiisted in. its Management Whose sole purpose was to study the Yields of 
profitable application of capital and to discover ways and means of 
invading these areas. Highly-Paid economists, engineers, and. lawyers 
from this' section developed new methods of usurpation. ,The morale and 
lawfulness of these experts was unquestioned: every means is suitable 
in the Struggle for profit. It is_interesting that in the course Of 
ten years (from 1928 to 1939). the then-vice-president of GM, Charles 
Wilson', directly supervised this section. His activities in this field 
Vital to the concern were so fruitful that he later became president of

locomotive over the steam engine. Thus', when technical progress. premised

such "trifles" as ruining plants Which competed with them did not worry 
them. What were laws of ethics and simple human conscience to them: 
They paid no attention to this. This is how Wilson and his section 
operated. In accordance with a plan of sabotage painstakingly conceived 
by them in 1929 and 1930, 'two petty companies which manufactured a small 
number of diesel locomotives ceased to exist. In 1941 General Motors 
turned Out 13 percent Of all diesels. In 1956 the trade-mark of CM

America to chastise those atheists outside the United States who term 
these Miraculous conversions crimes? 
If these lines ever catch the eye of some well-educated gentleman

of this corporation who dream of a:"great mission," he will respond with 
a curt, angry "That's ridiculous!" Curtic,preeident of GM, replied

Thls was' in the 19th century; but in the 20th the Unsightly pictare 
of political dispositions painted by this great poet bedame-still gloomier* 
In the report of the Central Committee of the OPSU to the 20th Party 
Congress, N. S. IhradhChev stated that "monopolistic capital directly Sab-
ordinates government organs to it by sending its representatives into it 
and by forcing the government Ito regulate' the economy of the country 
in the interests of monopolies." 
' Even before the first world. war, on 13 Pebraary 1913 at article by 
Woodrow Wilson was published in the Forttightly Review on the eve of his 
-assumption of the post of President of the United States, At the height 
of a bitter controversy, Wilson made the following interesting admission: 
"The real masters of the United States government are the amalgamated 
bankers and industrialists. This is apparent from every page of Congress' 
decisions and from all meetings in the White Rouse._ the people from Whom 
the government seeks advice concerning its policy are the large bankers, 
industrialists, and leaders of the trade, railroad, and steamship com, 
panies. The United States government at the present time is the off-
spring of monopolies. 
Senator Morse recently expressed this opinion concisely bat no less 
eloquently. Paraphrasing the words of Lincoln, he said that the Eisen, 
:hower government is a government of bankers, selected by bankers for 
bankers* 
In November 19559 senators in one of the commissions of the American 
Congress demonstrated unusual spirit. They set about the "study" of 
General Motorst,as Senator O'Mahoney announced, not without bragging. 
The reasons for this Zeal will be explained. below0 At this point it is

companies for their profits, on which large monopolies were encroaching,

This concept is quite openly expressed by the millionaire Sloan, who

for 20.yeare until April l956! Sloan defined_the tasks of the _"peoples"

the, largest division of General Motors in the sale of automobiles, was 
promoted to chairman of the National CoMmittee of the Republican 
Party. Of the two aspirants to the post of president at the 1952 conven-
tion of the 'Republican Party, Taft and General Eisenhower, the Du Pohts 
and General Motors preferred the latter. The son of the president of 
GM, Wilson, headed one of the committees for the election of Eisenhower. 
He was supported by the vast empire of General Motors with its divisions 
situated :in a majority of the United States. Wilson, the president of 
GM, and. his assistants played an important role in promoting Eisenhower's 
nomination for the post of president daring the Republican Party Convention. 
It is quite astonishing then that in January 1953 Wilson was appeinted 
Secretary of Defense and SuMmerfield -- Postmaster General? Douglas McKay, 
director of a division of General Motors in Oregon, was confirmed as 
Secretary of the Interior, and Robert Stevens, former director of this 
and other CorpOrationb L.- the Secretary Of the Army. Roger Keyes, a 
former vice-president of General Motors, became Assistant Secretary of 
Defense. When GM was assured of profitable government contracts, Keyes, 
who retired in May 1954, returned to his office in General Motors, for 
the government really had began to resemble a Washington division of 
General Motors, 
What Is Good for the United States 
The Department of Defense and other commanding heights of the'govern-
ment-apparatus of the United States were controlled by the General' Motors 
concern; but not without difficulties.' It was not because this operation 
was illegal, but because it was oondudted in the interests of this 
monopoly and not the masses of people. The difficulties were engendered 
by the fact that many other concerns besides General Motors reached for 
,..the government treasury and power. This was demonstrated with great 
clarity when the United States Senate appointed Wilson secretary. 
This appointment was a simple formality for Wilson. The enormous 
capital of General Motors was quite a sufficient recommendation for this 
important post. However, senators connected with those firms who had 
been dealt with unfairly in the distribution of military contracts timidly 
and respectfully raised the question concerning the legality of Wilson"s 
appointment. Back in the good. old days when monopolies were still not so 
all-powerfal, a law was passed which forbade Persons in government service 
from doing business with those companies in which these government offi-
cials had capital invested. 
The question posed to Wilson was quite timely. Everyone knew that 
General Motors had long used the Department of Defense for indrea6ing 
its own capital. Prom the moment of Wilson's appointMent'it waS Clear-
that-he Owned aock in General Motors valued at-least $2.5 million. 
In addition, he had invested money in theDu,PontNational Bank of Detroit

and also in a company exploiting oil-bearing land in Texas and Colorado. 
It also became,well-known that his wife's capital was invested in a 
number of companies, including General Motors. This woman also acquired 
"In all only" 7,500 shares of the Greyhound Bus Company whose lines cover 
a major portion of the United States. 
- The question of Wilson's appointment was a polite hint that General 
Motors and Wilson :himself were using the government treasure in their own 
self-interest. Nonetheless, the punctilious senators were still able to 
e moderately reconciled, with this factq quite recently former Attorney 
General Biddle lamented the fact that Americans "forget what public dis-
lionesty always creates." The senators Were more indignant over the fact 
?that GeneralMotorvwas 'W) high-handed in driving its competitors away 
from the government feed box. Voicing their interests, Johnson, leader 
of the ,Democrats in the .Senate? declared that "no one privately owned 
enterprise is more important to the Department of Defense than General 
Motors. On the,other.han4 no One government institution is more im-
portant to General Motors than the Department of Defense," 
Wilson decided that the senators' hints were improper ahd that the 
parliamentarians must be put in their place. In the beginning he 
menacingly declared that he intended to retain his stock. It was implied 
that he reserved the post of Secretary of Defense for himself. The 
senators stood their ground. The incensed Wilson hurled a catch-phrase 
at_a?meeting of the commission: "What is good for General Motors is also 
good for the United States." Who knows how this Whole affair would. have. 
ended had.19.1son not announced that he_would sacrifice and sell all his 
ahares. It remains only to point out that he recovered his share holdings 
with interest as soon as he left the Pentagon. 
The satisfied senators approved Wilson as secretary. The appreciative 
Du Pont3estalaiShed a.life "pension" of $40,000 a year for him as com-
pensation for his "sacrifices" and "distressing experiences." In addition, 
by agreement with General Motors, he retained the right to a bonus of the 
vast pam of $800,000 for three years. 
Wilson did not remain under obligation to the bosses of the concern. 
By September 1953 General Motors had sliced off a thick piece of govern-
ment pie. The Department of Defense (Wilson) signed a contract with G14 
(friends and colleagneeof Wilson) for $204 million for the delivery of 
medium tankg, to the American Army. Following this, the government en-
trusted General Motors with the production and delivery of army trucks. 
The concern received $85 million more. And the contracts kept growing, 
4 one point General Motors declared, not without self-satisfaction, 
that 4.19q (4e, firSt,year'of Wilson's "selfless" activities in govern-
ment) its gross profits (before paying taxes) amounted to $1,716,341,000.

In that same year 557,260 white and blue collar workers were employed 
at enterprises of this concern. Prom each worker the company received a 
gross PrOfit of $3,080. 
A Kowtowing Revolt 
An unusual event took place on 8'November 1955 in the building of the 
United States Congress. Many correspondents of American and foreign news-
papers, photographers, cameramen, associates of radio and TV broadcasting 
stations, government figures, members of Congress, and representatives of 
the largest industrial Companies and banks crowded the halls. This day 
marked the first meeting of the long-threatened commission for "examining 
the activities of monopolies." Some people expected a sensational expose. 
At last, they said triumphantly, a commission is engaged in the study of 
the activities of that gigantic monopoly, General Motors, the largest 
military-indUstrial concern in the world. Ctrtice, president of the con-
dern the 80-Year-old Sloan, chairman of its board and one of America's 
richest businessmen, two first vice-presidents, 14 "ordinary" vice-presi-
dents, and experienced lawyers and economists of this monopoly were invited 
to appear before the commission. 
-.People uninformed of the secret interrelationships of this monopoly 
with the government and Congress, naively believed that the day of reckon-
ing had come. There was no end to the intrigues and crimes of General 
Motors. The concern's guilt could easily have been proven on every point 
of the charge: the seizure of government posts and their use for personal 
enrichment; unlawful establishment of a monopoly in a number of fields 
of industry, displacement from these fields of other companies, and their 
ruin; exploitation of the difficulties of other countries to penetrate 
their markets and force out local companies; criminal connections with 
Ritlerite Germany; use of the second world war and the war in Korea for 
personal enrichment; complicity in formulating a policy of militarization 
and imposition of fascist methods upon the United States and use of this 
policy for purposes of profit; bribery of the American press by means of 
advertisements, etc. A special charge could have been made that the con-
cern had Used a significant portion Of the value produced by the workers 
of its enterprises for purposes of personal enrichment, and that the con-
cern was waging a systematic attack on the elementary rights of workers 
through its use of the government apparatus. 
The Congressional =mission began its work. Senators 00Mahoney, 
Wiley, and Langer made their opening speeches before the objective 
scrutiny of the movie and TV cameras and photographers. Their statements, 
however, immediately Showed that the long-planned "investigation" of the 
activities of General Motors was a Shameful farce. The address of Senator 
OlMahoney, acting chairman of the commission, had a strange effect. One 
would have thought that the charge was being impuned against the commission 
-69-

Approved For Release 2001/07/28 : CIA-RDP65-00756R000300270001-9 
and not against General Motors. The senator began by refuting reports in 
newspapers that the concern would be made to answer. He assured its 
directors that the commission was convened merely to study and not to 
hold an inquiry. He declared that there would be neither defendants nor 
accusers at meetings of the commission. The remainder of his speech was 
reminiscent of a report of the chairman of the board of UM on the successes 
of the concern. At the end of his Address 01Mahoney rebUked the company 
for its monopolistic position in several fields of industry and for dis-
lodging its competitors. 
The commission met for more than a month. Specially selected 
IIwitnesses" appeared. They spoke on Whatever they liked, but not about 
the lawlessness of General Motors. ,Representatives of trade unions were 
not invite0o appear before the commission. 
A report on the results of the "study" was published in April 1956. 
The mountain bad. brought forth a mouse. The suggestions of the commission 
represented no danger whatsoever to the concern. It recommended that the 
question of restricting the expansion of activities of this monopoly 
be again studied and examined anew. 
The American press maliciously noted that the kowtowing revolt was 
undertaken by members of Congress manifestly for pre-election purposes, 
to fool voters, and we add, to create the appearance of contending with 
a big monopoly. 
For these same purposes the government joined in "battle" with 
General Motors. The speech of Brownell, Attorney General of the United 
States, Which loudly proclaimed that the General Motors monopoly had 
been made to answer was advertised in every possible way before the 1956 
elections. "At last:" Americans exclaimed. But this time also dis-
appointment befell them. Proceedings were actively begun against the 
corporationc but only for the fraudulent seizure of motor bus manufac-
turing, for one-thousandth part of all the lawlessness Which this monopoly 
had perpetrated. It would also seem that the demands of Attorney General 
Brownell Were ridiculously modest. He wanted neither the return of capital 
to ,ruined companies, nor the imposition of a fine, nor any other punish-
ment,. Outwardly currying the favor of the monopolistic plunderers, Brownell 
turned to the corporation with the loyal appeal that it reduce its Share 
in the manufacture of motor buses from 85 to 50 percent. 
The shyness which the Attorney General displayed with regard to 
General Motors, is completely understandable. He well remembered the 
history of his assistant who, whether as a result of remorse ox' because 
hehadulot unravelled the simple question of Who his boss was, came out, 
nevertheless, with a number of quite reserved "friendly warnings" 
addressed to General Motors in connection with its violations of laws on 
monopolies, In answer to these statements it was sufficient for GM

president Ourticeto hurl bitterly a single word, "Bidiculoust" The 
44eietant Attorney General vas relieved of his responsibilities and sent 
far away to the West as a judge. Let us keep in mind that the Chief 
activity of the Attorney General of the American government is reprisal 
against and. the persecution of workers and progressive organizations and 
figures and not monopolies and the reverend gentlemen of corporations. 
In its almost 50 years of existence General Motors was brought to court 
only five times for violation of anti-trust laws; in three of these 
eases, proCeedings against it were discontinued. In capitalistic America 
GM can calmly continue its activities with fear that its crimes will be 
discovered. 
A Conspiracy Against the People 
Dhr1.n4;the second world war Downey, a representative of General 
Motors, cynically declared that mwar is a struggle for control over the 
world. It undoubtedly represents one of a series of wars, the first of 
which occurred 1311914.1918. The Anglo-Saxons must rale the world." 
,Along with the directors of other monopolies the businessmen of 
General Motors bear a portion of the responsibility for unleashing the 
second "mad war. 
The criminal ties between the Hitlerites and the directors of this 
concern were uninterrupted right up to the beginning of this war. In 
1937, Sloan, representing the board of directors of the concern, together 
With Senator Vandenburg. of Michigan, Who in the United States is called 
the Senator -.roln General Motors, and other figures conferred with the 
Hitlerites concerning important economic and political questions. A year 
later, after Musaich,Knudsen, former president of the concern, sent Hitler 
a congratulatory telegram. In 1938 Hitler awarded a medal to Mooney, 
vice-president of General Motors. As for back as 1929 the concern estab-
lished its control over the German automobile company Adam Opel. Thus, 
it happened that the production of half of all automobiles manufactured 
by fascist Germany before the war was in the hands of GM. Apparently, 
considering this the American government in 1949 invited Charles D. 
Wilson, president of the corporation, to take part in the work of the 
commission on reparations. With suspicious unanimity the commission 
came to the conclusion that it was 5inexpedient" to dismantle German 
military plants in which not only Wilson and his concern, but also his 
partners in big business were interested. 
After the second world war the monopolies dictated to the American 
government an aggressive course of preparation for a new war, for artifi. 
eta]. aggravation of international relations. This was done to insure 
vast Profits from military contracts by again militarizing the economy. 
or these very purposes the American monopolies prepared and unleashed 
the war in Korea with the appearance of the first signs of economic 
crisis in 1948-1949.

the war in Korea.

often than.the others. Of the companies working for the war, General

(19504953) it received contracts for more than WM= billion dollars.

it was necessary to obtain more military contracts from the government 
treasury. For this it was necessary to juggle the military budget 
throats* Congress, and if there was no war, then a budget for "defense.' 
Members of Congress would not object. If the taxpayers Objected, it would 
b. neceseary to intimidate them with a fictitious 'threat of aggression' 
on_the part of the USSR and China. And if words were not effective, the 
monopolies of the United States, through their servitors in American 
Amtelligence, would arrange provocations not unlike the Hungarian situa-
'tion.-
-And Wilson is doing his best. In 1954 he declared that "militant 
Communism is a military, political, social, and economic threat.". In 
1955 he threatened the American man in the street with the statement that 
the Soviet Union, in his words, represented "the main threat to peace 
throughout the entire world." In 1956 Wilson, =confused by the complete 
lack of logic, declared, "The United States in the next years intends 
to retain the present size of its Armed Forces and provide them with the 
best weapons, in spite of talk about lessening international tensions.' 
Incidentally, the, number of United States troops in the middle of 1956 
was 2,285,000 soldiers and officers. This is the largest Army the United 
States has maintained at any period in peace time. Wilson achieved new 
heights of hypocrisy and dissimulation in 1957. Trying to convince the 
American taxpayer of the "necessity" of voluntary sacrifices in connec-
tion.with Congress? examination of the military budget, and the approach 
of actual military expenditures to $43.5 billion, he declared that 'events

in Hungary and shutting their eyes to the aggression of their partners 
in the Middle East, American ruling circles are forcing Americans to pay 
for the profits of monopolies. 
Such is the role which the General Motors corporation and its 
representatives in the government of today's America play in the United 
States., 
The Financipl "Empire" of the Mellons I. Lapitekiy 
On that very cold wintry day in the beginning of 1953 when the 
Republican Party again returned to power in Washington after a twenty-year 
interruption, a little-noticed but quite Significant event took place in 
the separate, massive, granite building of the Treasury Department on the 
corner of 15th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington. The portrait 
of Andrew Mellon, which had hung for 20 years in a reception room, had 
been moved over to a more prominent spot. Hy instructions of the new 
Secretary of the Treasury, George Humphrey, it was displayed in the 
office of the Secretary. 
The new Secretary knew What he was doing. He was director of more 
than 30 industrial companies and chairman of the board of directors of 
the Mellon coal concern,Pittsburg Consolidated -- one of the largest 
coal companies in America. The re-positioning of the portrait was sym-
bolic. It bore witness to the firm resolve of millionaires of the new 
government to follow the methods of the head of one of the largest finan-
cial-industrial empires of the United States, Who ran the American 
treasury under three presidents: Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover. 
Andrew Mellon, who held the post of Secretary of Treasury for ten 
years at a stretch, admittedly created "standards" -- until recently con-
sidered. classics -- of manipulating the financial and taxation policies 
in the interests of the largest monopolies of the United States. The 
American publisher F. Landberg wrote this about Mellon in his hook, 
Sixty American Families: "Immediately after the inauguration of the 
President (Harding), the piratic team of poker players, seizing the ship 
of state, began a struggle for the strong-box with the faultless instinct 
of burglars searching for family jewels." 
Historians have calculated that during Mellon's tenure as Secretary 
of the Treasury, income tax collected from millionaires and billionaires 
was reduced by $6 billion. Mellon perfected the art of shady intrigues 
which the Treasury Departments Skillfully developed during his tenure in 
office.

, Bow did the Melons enter the tight circle of rulers of modern 
An04.00, and. how was the dynasty of aluminum kings of the United States 
created? 
The Melons laid the basis for their fortune by speculating in real 
estate ii Pittsburg and its environs. Then their capital entered banks 
and subsequently the coal, metallurgical, oil, aluminum, electrotechnical, 
and glass industries of this rapidly developing industrial region. 
Merciless exploitation of American laborers and of the Cheap labor of 
immigrants, especially from countries of Eastern Europe, wars, and crises 
enriched the Mellon family. 
Dozens of banks and vast land tracts still comprise a significant 
part of the Mellon wealth. it the largest profits are made in the large 
scale monopolies controlled by the Mellons, such as Aluminum Company of 
America (ALMA), Gulf Oil Corporation, Westinghoase Electric Corpora, 
tion, Koppers and Company, Jones and Laflin, and dozens of other concerns, 
truets and corporations in the coal, electric, gas, copper, chemical, and 
aircraft indastries, and also railroad transportation, municipal services, 
the insurance business, etc. By the beginning of 1957 the financial 
group of Mellons had amassed capital amounting to $10.5 billion. 
A. progressive American newspaper once carried a caricature: a fat 
gentlemen calming a crying woman: 
"Someone mast bear the sacrifice, madam," he said. "In time of war 
we lose song, in time of peace -- profits." 
War and its preparation always brou&t enormous profits to the 
Mellons. /t was not accident that the capital of the Mellons was invested 
in fields of industry tied with the production of weapons of war -- in 
the manufacture of aluminum and steel, in the production of oil, electri-
cal machinery building, atomic production. 
The basic modern industrial empire of the Mellons is ALCOA, a 
monopoly in the strict meaning of the word. It was able to seize control 
of the sources of raw material (bauxite) and the patents to the basic 
production process of this important field of industry. For 50 years 
ALCOA was the sole supplier of aluminum in the United States. The first 
world war led to a vast increase in the demand for aluminum. ALCOA. did 
not sail to exploit this demand. In the period of 1914-1916 it tripled 
the price of aluminum. The war gilded Aura, that is, the Mellons with 
gold. After the war ALCOA paid out as a dividend one thousand percent 
of:its initial capital. Thin company, which held controlling shares in 
many large electric power companies, provided itself with cheap sources 
of electrical energy needed for production of aluminum.

The sphere of ALCOLIs influence extended far beyond the limits of 
the United States. It enveloped Canada (the entire aluminum industry) 
and the bauxite mines of countries of Latin America, Britain, Dutch 
Guinea, and the Gold Coast. In addition, ALCOA controls many trusts and 
enterprises in. France, Italy, England, Germany, Switzerland, India, and 
other countries. 
Autu rules in world aluminum market. It closes cartel agreements 
with all large producers of aluminum in other capitalistic countries. 
At one time it signed such an agreement with the German concern I. G. 
Farben. This gave the Mellon monopoly the opportunity of seizing the 
patents for the production of magnesium and its alloys. nou gained con-
trol over the Dow Chemical Company -- the sole producer of magnesium in 
the United States. 
The second world war, the postwar arms race, and the war in Korea 
brought now riches to the Mellon aluminum monopoly, which is closely 
connected with the aircraft industry and the production of radar equip-
ment in the United States. These fields of military production now yield 
the greatest profits. 
James Kindalberger, representative of the aircraft company North 
American Aviation philosophized several years ago, "One can compare an 
airplane to an egg. It is necessary to sell it while it is fresh..." 
So reason the owners of ALCOA, which sells more than three-fourths 
of its production to the aviation industry. 
The profits of the aircraft industry monopolies in the past years 
acquired such incredible proportions that in 1956, in the United States, 
demands were heard to investigate the sources of these superprofits as 
well as the suspicious activities of a large number of retired generals 
and admirals Who migrated from different military departments into 
offices Of aircraft corporations. 
Speaking before one of the Congressional subcommittees, William 
Allen, president of Boeing, the largest aircraft monopoly, declared 
plainly, "Congress must not ponder whether we are earning too much; it 
must be concerned whether we are earning enough..." 
And the subcommittee agreed with him. 
Despite lessening of international tension, appropriations for 
military needs in the United States were again increased in the 1956/1957 
budgetary year. United States News and World Report again declared tri-
umphantly, "The Armed Forces are the largest business of America." The 
enemies of disarmament and the advocates of maintaining international 
tension again won the upper hand.

One can judge that cOnclasion the directors of Mellon's ALCOA drew 
from all this, from the statement of its president Wilson, Who reported 
in the summer of 1956 that his company intended to Spend $600,000,000 in 
expanding its production during the next five years. Of course, nom 
is basing its plans on continued vast military appropriations and very 
profitable military contracts. Exploiting its monopolistic position, 
ALCOA continues to inflate its production prices. It instituted a 
regular price increase on aluminum in March 1956; two months later its 
president spoke of a new price increase. 
'"But in the United States a special law against monopolies exists --
the so-called Sherman Antitrust Law," says a reader. "In such a case how 
can ODA -a tYpical monopoly as ALCOA continue to operate with impunity?"' 
Actually, the monopolistic practices of ALCOA have acquired ea& a 
scandalous nature and caused so mach harm to the national interests of 
the country, that in 1937, under public pressure, the United States 
goVertkett undertook "antitrust" judicial action against the aluminum 
nempany. But this "action" is dragging out up to the present day. In 
1954 the court affirmed that ALGOL is a monopoly; in 1956 the government 
confirmed that despite the appearance of several small, new companies, 
ALCOA as before rules the aluminum market. The Wall Street Journal  
Trete in 1956, "The officials conducting the antitrust action for Uncle 
Sam (i.e., the United States government) decided that they needed five 
more years to. determine how to deal with the Aluminum Company of 
America. The investigation of the ALCOA action was again postponed, 
this time until 1961. 
This is the way the "antitrust" law "operates" in the United States. 
The Melons began to demonstrate an interest in oil at the end of 
the last century. The Mellon oil company, Gulf Oil Corporation, was 
born and raised in the bitter competitive struggle against Rockefeller's 
Standard Oil. 
Golf Oil acquired oil deposits in Latin America, Canada, the Near 
Bast and the Philippines. It penetrated into Italy, Spain and Denmark. 
Gulf Oil actively interferes in the internal affairs of other coun-
tries. One of the greatest scandals of its time was the gross inter-
ference of American ruling circles in the affairs of Columbia for the 
purpose of ensuring the transfer of rich oil concessions in this country 
to the Mellon Oil trust. Ear obvious .purposes of extortion, Ameridan 
bankers introduced a, financial embargo against Columbia which provoke a 
political and economic crisis in this country. They forced Columbia to 
adopt a new law on exploitation of oil deposits Which allowed the Mellon 
condom: to obtain the right to work the largest oil deposits in the world 
for 50 years.

The activity of Gulf Oil outside the United States was especially 
intensified after the second world war. It demanded a re-examination of 
Brazilian laws to facilitate seizure of Brazilis oil industry. In this 
period Gulf Oil obtained a concession in Portugese East Africa involving 
an over-all acreage of 45,000 square miles, and in 1956 -- a concession 
for prospecting and extracting oil in Bolivia covering a territory of 
1.6 million hectares for a period of 40 years. Gulf Oil cruelly exploits 
the workers of many countries at its numerous enterprises situated through-
out the entire world, especially in the Near and Middle last and In Latin 
America. It invariably encourages feudal-serf relations and the most 
reactionary forces. These serve to support it and help to extort profits. 
The Gulf Oil Corporation is an active participant in the interna-
tional oil cartel in which American monopolies run the show. Joined with 
four other American and two English corporations, the cartel actually 
controls all extraction of oil in the capitalist world outside the United. 
States. According to data in Busin_x_i_al_kiee, daring the six:postwar 
years these seven corporations received $12 billion in super-profits from 
their foreign operations. (Super-profits, as interpreted by the magazine, 
is that surplus over the profit the corporations would have received had 
they invested capital in their own countries.) 
It is difficult to find a field of defense industry in which Mellon 
capital has not been invested. The atomic arms race and the prodaction 
of mass destructive weapons have brought it even greater profits. ,The 
Mellon-Rockefeller Westinghouse Electric Company wages a persistent 
struggle against Morgan's General Electric for control over the atomic 
industry. This large-scale (second to Morgan's General Electric) 
American electrical concern manufactures more than 8,000 different types 
of articles, valued generally at one and one-half billion dollars a year, 
in its 87 plants throughout the United States. Among these products are 
equipment for atomic plants, jet engines for the air force and the Navy, 
and many other military products. 
"We place the highest priority on atomic production now," says 
president Price of Westinghouse Electric. 
In this connection, the magazine Time remarked that "atomic produc-
tion is_the favorite child of Price. It grows not by days but by the 
hour..) 
The owners of Westinghouse, as well as other monopolies who profit 
from atomic and hydrogen weapons, impede the use of atomic energy for 
peaceful purposes not only in their own country but in other capitalist 
states. They are successful in this in particular, because over the past 
decade concerns controlled by Morgan, the Mellons, the Bockefellers, and 
Du Pont, lad their hands on the most important deposits of uranium in 
the capitalist world.

rae.Mellons are seizing the command positions in the industry of many 
countries. The Westinghouse concern owns shares of the West German 
electrical mamhine7b4ilding trust of Siemens. After the war it bought 
Many Shares cheaply of the Japanese concern of Mitsubishi and encroached 
on the4ndastry of Italy and other West Nuropean countries. 
The Westinghouse _concern has become interested in a most direct way 
in maintaining the American occupation of the Chinese island of Taiwan. 
Westinghouse contraeover thirty electric power stations there. In 
order to make sure that the flow of military contracts does not cease, 
American monopolies need tension .in international relations. Per many 
years the Mellons have liberally financed a number of newspapers in 
Pittsburg and other cities of Pennsylvania, dictating a propaganda line 
to them. They seized control over a whole series of newspapers, magazines, 
radio stations, and television centers outside of Pennsylvania. 
Pahl Mellon, one of the representatives of this dynasty, acquired 
Aa large number of shares of the magazine Newsweek, which occupies itself 
with systematic propaganda for war and malicious slandering of countries 
of the camp of peace and democracy, Many Mellon monopolies directly own 
means of propaganda. The Westinghouse concern alone owns six large radio 
stations and two television stations. 
The financial empire of the Melions is powerful. But the workers' 
movement, which is growing and becoming stronger in the bitter skirmishes 
with its, mortal enemy -- monopolistic capital, is shaking the Mellon 
empire and other oligarchies of big capital to their foundation.

These are the words of Steve Nelson, leader of the steel workers 
and miners of Pennsylvania. Nelson has spent many years of his life 
struggling against the yoke of monopolies. His childhood was spent in 
need and deprivation. As a youth, he worked as a carpenter and Later , 
as steel worker in a plant of the Jones and Laflin company in Pittsburg, 
where he fought for the creation of a trade union with other comrades, 
mmarter of a century ago, Nelson, together with a group of young unem-
ployed workers, was arrested by police for demanding work and bread. 
Five days later he again marched in a number of demonstrations staged by 
the unemployed. These were black years of crisis, mass unemployment,

bleek: hunger, and. misery. But they were also the years of the rise of the 
workers 1 movement. Nilson organized the then unemployed in a struggle 
for their rights, for grants-in-aid, an for work. The police beat him 
mercilessly and threw him in jail. But again he joined the ranks of the 
fighters for the cause of the working class. 
The course of the struggle against the oppressors of the people 
brought Nelson into the glorious ranks of the International Brigade which 
fought against German-Italian fascism on the battlefields of Spain. A 
determined, selfless fighter, he enjoyed the general confidence and love 
of his comrades. Nilson was a lieutenant colonel in the Abrabant Lincoln 
(15th) Brigade. There were 3,000 American compatriots in that brigade; 
1,800 of them died bravely in battles with fascism. Nilson modestly 
tells of this heroic period in his life in the book Volunteers. He returned 
from Spalswith a deep scar; a fascist bullet had passe& several inches 
from the spot where, all his life, he retained reminders of the bludgeons 
of the Chicago police. 
But let us return to the Pittsburg court building. Nilson is on 
crutches: he had received serious injuries in an automobile accident. 
They dragged him directly into court from a hospital, where they attempted 
to "take care" of him by sending in a hired killer. But presence of mind 
and courage did not fail Nelson. He had disarmed the bandit.... 
Agents of monopolies judged Nelson. Edward Boyle spike as the chief 
accuser. He was charged to let Nilson and. his comrades rot in prison. 
The purpose was to terrorize workers and their organizations in the largest 
center of the defense industry, the state of Pennsylvania. 
This happened at the height of the wax in Korea. Plants in Pittsburg 
labored over fulfillment of large military contracts. Into the safes of 
the Hellons and other manufacturers flowed many billions in profits. 
With violent malice the cannon kings of America pounced on those who 
demanded a termination of the war and a renunciation of the arms race. 
In search of means to mete out punishment to active proponents of peace, 
they._grasped the so-called law on "incitement to revolt," adopted in 
Pennsylvania in 1919 daring the period of the powerful rise of the strike 
movement., The Stockholm Appeal for banning atomic weapons, and brochures 
calling for a struggle for peace against the unleashing of a third world 
war figures as "material evidence" at the trial, together with the classical 
works of Marxism-Leninism. 
.Net. one of the 700 lawyers in Pittsburg and neighboring cities decided 
to undertake the defense of Nelson. They feared persecution and repres-
sion. The experienced anti-fascist was forced to defend himself.

OM the head. of his judges Belson appealed to the people. He 
related_how_Mellon and -other monopolists profited from war, how they were 
attempting to undermine and crush the growing movement of the advocates 
of4sace -- the insuperable movement of our time. They repeatedly inter-
rupted him and tried to silence him. But Nelson, a Communist-revolu-
tionary, angrily unmasked the enemies of peace and democracy, those who 
want to fling mankind into the gulf of a new world war. 
"We are,victims of legal frame up organized by large monopolies 
profiting from U28 war in Urea," said Nelson. "Look out the window of 
the. courtroom. No matter Where you look, you. will see the buildings of 
large Monopolies. You will see the building of the Mellon oil company --
GulLOil, the building of the Mellon aluminum company, the building of an

concealed the ttempt to check the huge M8V88 of the strike movement

, 
-11The chief criminals in this judicial farce," said Nelson, "are 
Mellon and Morgan, and the rich men of Pittsburg.... They are making 
millions from the war..-. They say: 'If you interfere in our plans, you 
land behind bars.' They bear the responsibility for high prices and

this. brutal sentence, to liberate this courageous fighter for peace. 
.Angry protests came from every corner of the earth. Judge Montgomery, 
who passed the sentence, was compelled to admit that "so many telegrams 
and. letters had been received that Nelson's prison cell could be filled 
with them." According to information of the Congress of the Struggle 
for Defense of Civil Rights, 10,000 letters and telegrams demanding Nelson's 
liberation on bond were sent to Pittsburg. Under public pressure, the 
state supreme court was compelled to satisfy the petition to set a bond 
and to liberate Nelson temporarily after 239 days of imprisonment. Four 
days later, he was again dragged into court, this time accused of violating 
the reactionary Smith Law. Nelson was sentenced, in all, to 25 years'

imprisonment. The campaign for Nelson's release broke out with new force. 
Reaction was forced to recede. The Pennsylvania State Supreme Court 
admitted that Nelson's conviction for 20 years on the basis of the local 
law of 1919 on "incitement to revolt" was improper, tut the sentence for 
violation of the Smith Law remained in force. In the spring of 1956 
a federal court was obliged to set aside the execution of this sentence 
also. 
The State of Pennsylvania has long been the arena of the most bitter 
battles of the United States proletariat against its oppressors. An old 
man grey with age sat among the spectators in that Pittsburg court room. 
A wrinkled face, a firm jaw, eyes that shown angrily beneath busby eye-
brows. The old man intently followed the trial of Nelson and his comrades 
James Dolson, the 68-year-old correspondent for the Daily Worker in Western 
Pennsylvania, and Walter Lowenfels -- a correspondent for the same news-
paper in Eastern Pennsylvania. 
Pat Cash is 85 years old, bat he has a lucid mind and perfect 
memory. Cast is one of the veterans of the straggle of the American 
working class. He took part in the famous strike of steel workers of 
Homestead (near Pittsburg) in 1892 And since that time tad not ceased 
the straggle in behalf of the working-people. He began working at the 
age of ten after his father was cradhed to death by a ranaway freight ear. 
Pat was proud that his father -- an immigrant-worker Who fled from Ireland 
during the potato famine -- was one of the pioneers of the Sons of the 
Vulcan, the first trade union of workers of the metallurgical industry 
of the United States. Pat recalled how, on 21 June 1877, ten Miners in 
Pottsville and Mauch Chunk: were hanged because they refused to tolerate 
unbearable working conditions. Later, When the indignation of workers 
had become still more intensified, Mellon agents hanged ten more miners. 
The fortune of the Mellons is founded on the blood of workers, 
monstrous exploitation, and bloody terror. 
"It is impossible to control coal miners without machine-gans," 
asserted. Richard Mellon. 
Brutal exploitation and violent terror was the Mellon policy toward 
workers. If reprisals against workers acquired an especially scandalous 
nature which provoked public indignation, the Mellons took steps to con-
ceal evidence of their crimes. When the Senate was compelled to set up 
an investigatory commission to pacify the public daring the 1927-1928 
strike of Pennsylvania miners, the Mellon Pittsburg Coal Company sent 
the following instructions to its manaeerss 
"The United States Senate investigatory commission is now travelling 
in the Pittsburg area. Cover up eterytbing that is unsightly. Restrain 
the police somewhat; try not to resort to arrests; instruct everyone to

present to them those Who will give proper answers to their questions. 
It the commission interrogates you personally, do not answer questions 
which In your opinion could damage our interests. The company will 
protect You..." 
The militant speeches of the workers and their craving for organiza-
tion did not cease. The strike movement in the United States assumed 
peat proportions after the first world var and the Great October Socialist 
Revolution in Rassia. In 1918-1919, more than a qaarter of a million 
steel votkers and nearly half a million coal miners, railroad and other 
workers -- in all, over a million people -- went on strike. The Pittsburg 
steel workers were among the first ranks of the working class. They 
were led by William roster, a prominent figure of the left-wing socialist 
movement who later became one of the organizers and leaders of the Communist 
Party of the United States. 
The difficult coarse of the straggle brought Pat Cash into the ranks 
of the Communist Party. He joined it When he was 60 years old. "I could 
not do otherwisei" he said. "I was born into the straggle..." Cash 
was not alone. Sons of the working class of America enter their Communist 
Party to fight among its tanks for their rights, for peace, and against 
Wit and. Capitalistic oppression.

The steel workers and miners of Pennsylvania are keenly aware of the 
attack on living conditions and rights of American workers Which became 
intensified after the second world war. In pursuit of maximum profits, 
the Morgans, Mellons, and other uncrowned kings of America converted the 
country into a military economy. They increased taxes, inflated prices, 
and engineered a reduction in wages. The sweatshop system of labor was 
becoming stronger. The number of workers killed from year to year in 
industry is figured in five-digit numbers and those maimed -- in seven,-
digits. 
kkeime,j...teek wrote, "Workers must labor for longer periods and with 
greater intensity. But instead of better pay they must be satisfied 
with lese...The die is cast. This time nothing remains but the Whip." 
The latter, phrase was underlined by the magazine. 
'Life completely corroborated the sinister prophecy of this organ of 
big capital. A worker of a Pittsburg metallurgical plant declared to a 
correspondent of the Daily Worker, "The owners have set a killing pace of 
work. Many workers cannot bear it. Pensions and social security are as 
:available to workers as a lark in the Sky. Workers are dying before they 
can deant on receiving a pension."

But the workers refused. to tolerate such a situation. They launched 
a counterattack. The strike movement in the years after the Second World 
War assumed. unprecedented proportions in the United States. Statistics 
bear witness to this fact. In the prewar decade (1931-1940), no more 
than 22,000 strikes were registered. in the United. States; 9.5 million 
workers took part and 145 million man-hours were lost. In the postwar 
years (1946-1955), the number of strikes increased to 43,000. More than 
26.5 million people took part and. more than 434 million man-hours were 
lost. 
4 keen class struggle has been developing in the United States 
during these years. The New York World Telegram and Sun wrote in 1955 
that the United States had. entered. a new "period of war on the labor 
front." The great heat of the strike struggle gloved. brightly in 1956 
when. the strike of 54,000 workers of the Westinghouse company, begun 
the year before, continued and 650,000 metallurgical workers, 60,000 
dock workers, 27,000 workers of aluminum plants, and many others went on 
strike in. the first national strike in the history of the United States. 
1957 was marked by a great number of strikes. In the first half of that 
year alone, 2,075 strikes occurred, many of them of considerable size. 
The workers of America., struggling for their daily economic demands, 
come out more often against the oppression of monopolies, against the 
aggressive foreign and reactionary internal policy of the ruling circles 
of the country, and for peace and. lasting democracy.

A swearing-in ceremony was taking place in one of the offices of 
the White House in Washington. Placing his left hand. on the Bible and

,the Office of Defense_Mobilization, just created, had had. concentrated. 
In his hands the control levers of the American indusrtry for the purpose 
of controlling the growing armaments rice. 
Wilson's appointment did not surprise anyone. 1950 was coming to 
an end.. On Wall Street, there were expressions of dissatisfaction over 
the "sluggishness" with which the American economy was converting itself 
into a military one daring the military ventury in Korea. Banks and. 
monopolies tried. to step up the armaments race sharply, to speed. the 
militarization of the United. States economy. The first steps in this 
direction had. already been taken. On _orders from Wall Street, Truman 
declared. a "state of emergency" in the country. In the salons of 
luxurious clubs, to which access was denied even for many "beginning" 
millionaires* it was decided. that leadership of the armaments race _should 
be entrupted._to a re1iab3.e man. It was considered on Wall Street that 
an iron band, an economic dictator was.. needed. Who could. fit this post 
better than Wilson of the Morgan General Electric, whom American news-
papers with respectful familiarity call "Electric Charlie"? 
It was for this very reason that the telephone rang on a December 
&Ander of 1950 in the, leJakrious, twelve-room private residence of Wilson. 
The Whit.e,goupe was 
Truman was on the phone. Respectfully inquiring after the health 
of the president of General Electric, the President of the United. States 
declared. that he needed Wilson for a very important and urgent business. 
He asked him to fly to Washington quickly. 
On Monday the massive figure of Wilson appeared in the White House. 
As the Washington newspapers reported, Wilson confronted. Truman with stiff 
conditions, --- ,completa freedom of action. subordination (in essence only 
ormal) on,1,7 to the President, complete power in economic questions, and 
the right to give orders directly to the secretaries and members of the 
Cabinet.. Truman asked. bim to grant one day for consideration. The next 
d,ay all, of Wilson? s conditions were accepted. 
When the President' aI'lexecutive order" granting dictatorial powers 
to Wilson in the military mobilization of the United States economy was 
published in the o.ewspapers, even the worldly-wise Washingtonians gasped. 
:It was stated in the order. _that Wilson would "manage, control, and coordi-
nate all activities of the government in the field. of mobilization... 
Ze can realize such functions through such officials and such organs and 
in such a manner as he sees fit..." Any previous order or directive of 
the President which conflicted with this order, was superceded.

to him that it was proper in this manner "to lash the country With a whip 
In order to place it in a position Where it could wage war." "The powers 
conceded to Wilson," wrote the magazine, "permit him to interfere in 
qmestions of taxation, foreign policy, an even leadership of military 
operations (in Korea V.), so far as questions of military supply 
are Concerned." 
The Morgan press did not conceal its jubilation. Morgan's com-
petitors were passed over; the distribution of military contracts fell 
into the hands of "his own man." The Morgan magazine Life was delighted. 
It wrote that Wilson received "the broadest powers ever conceded a United 
States civilian, outside of the President himself." "The Office of 
Defense Mobilization," the magazine observed, "Is a super-secretariat 
whose task is to expand sharply industrial production for war. It will 
operate as a council which develops policy and issues orders to all other 
organs connected with defense." 
In blurting out the innermost secrets of the American governmental 
machine, which consists of serving the monopolies, the Morgan magazine 
revealed the secret of government leadership in America. "Members of 
government over Whom Wilson has certain power" it wrote, "will act as 
directors of corporations with Wilson as head of the board. Directors 
of governmental organs will represent vice-presidents of companies, each 
of Whom answers for his particular department and all of Whom are 
accountable to Wilson. Thus, the Morgan magazine compared the United 
States government to a concern at the complete disposal of the magnates 
of financial capital. The comparison is a fully legitimate one. 
Armaments production, which was not curtailed by Wall Street after 
the war, was now sharply increased. From now on, everything in the country 
was subordinate to the general plan of monopolistic capital of the United 
States; gnus, guns, and more guns. This program left its mark on every 
field of public and political life in the country. One of the Washington 
magazines declared in plain terms that Wilson headed a machine, "which 
will control the daily life of every person" in the United States. 
* * * 
Opposite the left wing of the White House is an old-fashioned building 
ornamented with pretentious flourishes. In former days there was located 
here the State Department, in Whose many offices sat the diplomatic hench-
men of Wall Street. Here Wilson resided with his numerous bureaus and 
committees. The empty corridors and vestibules were filled with hundreds 
of officials. Many did not have sufficient room, so anterooms and hall-
ways were subdivided by numerous partitions.

Over the,bastling, noisy crowd reigned the voice of Wilson, Who 
spoke by telephone to one or another office. Gruff, unrestrained in his 
expressions, Wilson often used words which even the impertinent American' 
press could not repeat. He issued orders, demanded, threatened, and 
berated: The machine of military production, Whose tentacles covered the 
entire United States economy, was turned upside down and gathered momentum. 
Newspapers published diagrams of the new system of administration 
of the United States war industry. From a portrait of the new "economic 
dictator" in the center of the diagram stretched thick, black threads 
of control, like a spider's web, to countless circles, squares, and 
rectamees depleting the different fields of the American economy. 
Morgan's deputy seised machins-tools, ray materials, and the labor force 
and Concentrated them in his mina greedy, tenacious hands. 
The administrative apparatus of the "industrial mobilization" became 
known in Washington as "the second Cabinet." Wilson appointed more than 
100 representatives of the largest monopolies on Wall Street to the most 
important posts in this cabinet. Twenty of them formed a tight, internal 
circle representing the Morgan "government within a government" and 
directing affairs in Washington. 
,Allhot were these people? Whom did they represent? Whose interests 
did they uphold? Whose business did they promote? For Whose sake did 
they come to Washington, forsaking profitable, plush jobs on the boards 
of banks and.. industrial concerns? 
Wilson entrusted the selection of "his people" for the most important 
posts in his off100 to banker Sidney Weinberg. It was said in Washington 
.abeut_thisamall:Hactive, lively man with bustling mannerisms and hurried 
speech, that he is not only a symbol throughout all large businesses of

appointed representatives of large Morgan companies to magiAiportant 
posts in the system of the Office of Industrial Mobilization. When the 
:American press, prompted by Morgan's resentful competitors, raised a 
fuss over this question and Weinberg was forced to retire, all the chief 
pests of Wilson's office were filled by direct representatives of the 
Morgans. The Morgan Moor had done his duty.

Copper increased its profits by 102.9 percent. Yearly profits of monopolies 
in:theiJnited States reached an incredible level, exceeding $50 billion. 
Here is where the genuine roots of the frenzied arms race lay, and where 
the initial causes of the aggressive ventures of the United States beyond 
its borders profits -- are found.

What does Wilson, this former powerful boss in Washington, represent? 
According to Time, his father died When Wilson was three years old. The 
family lived in the western port area of Lower Manhattan in New York --
in wretChed slums which recetwed the curt nickname among the people of 
Kitchen." Great physical strength and a gruff, aggressive nature 
helped young Wilson to become ringleader in one of the many gangs which 
prepared neighborhood youths, transformed into inveterate criminals by 
capitalist conditions, for gangster "business." According to Time, many 
childhood friends of "the second. President" of Ulf:United States, as the 
press subserviently called Wilson, are now serving lengthy prison 
sentences in famous Sing Sing Prison. 
Wilson never made a secret of the fact that striving to get rich and 
make a fortune was the basis of his living philosophy. 
"I always wanted to make more money," he later related cynically in 
his biography. "And as quickly as possible." 
possessing great practical gumption, Wilson decided that the 
gangster business can bring only temporary profits. Either land in 
prison or, what is truer, be destroyed by a competitor in overt robbery. 
Wilson decided to undertake completely "legal" robbery, and where more 
profitable than Wall Street, located next to "Hell's Kitchen." 
At the beginning of the century, When Wilson went to work at the 
Sprague plant, later turned over to Morgan's General Electric, the 
workers sought to stick together to repulse their bosses and their 
watchdogs -- the foremen. This did not sait Wilson. He decided to deal 
with the boss by, himself. 
In plants, shops, and mines of America, workers waged a tense 
straggle to Organize trade unions. Plant and factory-owners replied to 
this struggle with cruel repressions and secret murders of trade-union 
organizers. Shots often rang out in narrow alleys at night. Leaders of 
workers engaged in the one-sided battle with monopolists were felled by 
police bullets.

of GeneraIElectric, Who had long noticed Wilson, appointed him chief 
engineir'et'a plant of thisMorgan company in. Bridgeport (Connecticut). 
AioOnifiXson_became assistant vice-president of this company and in 1930 --

Or President of Genera]. Electric, At the same time, he became a member 
Ofte board's of the Morgan rubber company Goodyear Tire and Rabber and 
the Morgan bank Guaranty Trust. He became owner of 2,698 shares of
General Electric. His galaxy reached $200,000 a year, not counting 
different gratuities. The young assistant boss of the Sprague plant had 
become a partner to the largest imperialist plunderers in profits and 
exploitation of workers. 
Profit was the chief motive for all Wilson's actions in the service 
of the 'Mar:genii. 
Th intrusive businessman had only approached the top of the hierarchy 
in GeneralXeCtrio When be developed an increasing interest in government 
polite in Washington ,This matter, of course, was not his sole personal, 
interest. '71heritorgans needed mailed fists similar to Wilson in government 
posts. Even in 1933 Wilson held the post of deputy director of the National 
Recovery Administration, created by Roosevelt. . 
-Wilson was ordered to Washington for the second time in 1942. His 
secret task was to provide his firm and other Morgan companies with the 
largest possible number of military contracts and scarce raw materials. 
Being in ..the War Production Board, he .quickly started a noigy-' 
squabble with the deputy director of the Board, ,Eberstadta 
banker, who managed the distribution of raw materials and who represented 
the interests of the banking house of Dillon, Read, and Company. When 
the skirmish had ended, Eberstadt had been driven into retirement and 
WilioilladHbeen appointed in his place. 
, 
Relating this commonplace episode from the point of view of the Wall 
Street morals, Wilson's biography states that while occupying Eberstadt's 
position,.. the Morgan henchman "directed materials where they were most 
needed." One can imagine that they were "most needed" by Morgan companies. 
In Washington the Morgan henchman behaved like an all-powerful boss. 
At one of the meetings of the Aircraft Industry Committee, the chief of 
the Servicesof Material Supply of the United States Army, General Brehon 
Somery,41 (now president of the Mellon Koppers Company), forgetting 
that 4t was the chief of American militarists and ,not their servant Who 
sat before him4 attempted to raise his voice to Wilson. Wilson jumped up 
from his place, rem over to the general, and seizing his collar, began 
shaking wish such force that the medals and badges of excellence on his 
breast began to jingle. Growling something and reddening, Somervell 
humbly remained in his place. Since that time the general has displayed

the greatest respect in dealing with the deputy of Well Street. But, 
In the words of the newspapers, "Of the many nicknames conferred on Wilson 
In Washington, there were many Which were unprintable.! 
The ambitious efforts of Wilson were not hampered by the War Produc-
tion Brd. e waved inupu J.ntruesegel4et'Aild .-numercua 
rivals and competitors. Washington newspapers reported at this time that 
Wilson had. arranged for the wire-tapping of telephone conversations in 
the office of his chief rival and competitor, the then Secretary of the 
Navy, James Forrestal of the bank of Dillon, Bead, and Company. 
A noisy scandal broke out. Nothing remained for Wilson it to 
deny the accusation. The newspapers published a refutation conveying 
their spologies to Wilson. There were few-people in Washington Who 
doubted that Wilson simply compelled the newspapers to "eat their words" 
in order to shield himself from the unpleasant incident in Which he had 
become involved. 
While in Washington, Wilson energetically increased the profits of 
the Morgan General Electric or GE, as the American press sometimes called 
it for short. During Wilson's tenure in the post of director of aircraft 
production, the industrial empire of the Morgans increased by 35 plants 
and the number of workers rose to 94,000. Physical output of the indus-
trial production of GE increased five times. Does not this testify to 
how the imperialist monopolies of the United States grew rich and profited 
from war? 
The second world war was nearing an end. Wilson's task was completed --
GE had picked up many billions of dollars of military contracts and had 
been transformed into one of the largest "dealers in death." Wilson 
retired from government affairs. In 1944 he was again "elected" president 
of General Electric. 
* * * 
If Charles E. Wilson had been inclined to reminisce While sitting 
once again on the board of the Morgan concern of General Electric in 
Schenectady, New York, he could have recalled several incidents of great 
value to the concern. During the first 50 years of its existence, this 
Morgan concern (four representatives of Morgan banks sat on its board) 
achieved a monopolistic position in the capitalistic world. Sixty per-
cent of all American electrical machine-building production belong to it. 
Even at the beginning of the century General Electric, together with the 
German :Universal Electrical Company (AEG) exercised almost complete rale 
of electronic equipment in the world market. Toward the end of the second 
world war, the Morgan giant of the electrotechnical industry proceeded 
to seize the productive might of all its rivals and competitors. After 
the war General Electric gained large amounts of stook (from 15 to 49

James Allen, an eminent American economist and expert on monopolies in 
the United States, almost one quarter of a million workers are employed 
in. firms under the control of the General Electric concern or connected 
with it outeide of the_Dnited States. Within the United States, While the 
incalallable profits of the Morgans multiply, more than a quarter of a 
million workers toil in 153 plants of the concern. The production of 
the General Electric concern is worth mom than $3 billion. 
An analysis of the profits received by this Morgan concern showed 
that its yearly profits were approximately 19 percent of the capital 
invested within the United States and 94 percent of the capital invested 
abroad. 
The arms race and production of weapons for the destruction of 
people has always been a source of enormous profits for General Electric. 
After the second world war the bosses of GE, the Morgans, displayed no 
intention of abandoning profits in the war business.

connected with this production.

After 1946 when the Morgan General 'Electric won out after a lengthy 
competitive struggle with theDaPon-Wover the production of plutonium 
in Hanford, Gil became a monopolist in the manufacture of the main integral 
component of atomic and hydrogen weapons. In truth, the Hanford plant 
formally belongs to the American government. GB only "manages" it. 
This, however, does not prevent it frti obtaining solid profits disguised 
as expenses in the management of thieplant. In 1949 this concern 
received from the government commission on atomic energy Which directs 
all atomic enterprises in the United States. $120 million to defray its 
empenses in producing plutonium. 
Naturally, the Horgan monopoly has not lost sight of the vast 
opportunities Which the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes creates 
in the way of profits for capitalist concerns. In his thorough study, 
Atomic Imperialism, James Allen presents a rather indicative statement 
by the vice-president of General Electric, Winne., to the Joint Commission 
of t4e, Congress on Atomic Energy. 
Chairman: Doctor Winner, General Electric will naturally enjoy great 
advantages in comparison to any other firm which is active in the produc-
tion of electronic equipment when it becomes possible to use atomic 
energy for peaceful purposes. 
Winne: In My opinion the basic consideration Which we are guided 
by generally in this matter (Atomic energy), is the fact that atomic 
energy to a lesser degree is fully capable of becoming a contributing 
factor in the production of electrical power in the future with greater 
ease, its dissemination over much wider areas, and at much lower prices 
than at the present. Any work of such a nature is of interest to General 
Electric... 
But let us return to Wilson. This sworn enemy of the organized 
labor movement in the United States went at one time, on behalf of the 
employers-of the staff of the so-called National 3LabOr RelatiOnsI

to unwrap the American military machine, to prepare for a now arms race 
and a new war. 
Together with his numerous partners, Wilson increased reactionary 
terror against all progressive organizations, against the American people 
who abhor monopolies and their policy of the arms race, aggression, and 
war. In different committees of the National Association of Manufacturers, 
in which large monopolies of the United States rule, directives were 
worked out in the struggle not only against Communism, but against all 
progressive, anti-military sentiments of workers. In August 1954, a law 
went into effect which banned the Communist Party of the United States. 
Another step was taken by the will of big capital on the road to reaction 
and fascism.

Several years ago the Morgan General Electric stepped up its attack 
on the progressive trade-union of workers of the electronic and radio 
industries, attempting to disrupt and destroy it. The notorious Senate 
Subcommittee on investigations was summoned to Schenectady, New York 
where large General Electric plants are located and to Albany, New York. 
,:li:717:9'The commission immediately got down to work: it summoned the trade-
union bosses and the rank-andr-file workers and subjected them to an 
inquisitorial cross-examination. To each was posed the same question.: 
"Are you not a mentor of the Communist Party of the United States?' 
Even before the meeting began, the General Electric concern announced 
that everyone Who refused to answer the questions of the commission would 
be fired.

But workers gave the inquisitors a fitting rebuff at the meeting in 
Albany. Amid the storm of applause of workers in the audience, A. L. 
Owens, a welder, angrily retorted to the notorious obscurantist Joe

loafer, undertake an investigation of the activities of General Electric

Just as before, henchmen of monopolies grab military contracts from 
each other; just as before, they create international conflicts and 
strengthen tension in international relations. And the straggle against 
their criminal activities is, as before, the chief task of the people and, 
above all, of the people of America. 
The Bank of the Dillons and Its International Ventures- V. Morey 
Once, in one of the buildings of the French Council of the Republic 
in Luxembourg Palace in Paris, a verbal inquiry was made to then Prime 
Minister of France, Mendes-France. The prime minister was asked whether 
he deemed it necessary to protest immediately "against announcements and 
speeches of government figures and ambassadors with whose aid leaders 
and representatives of the allied governments -- England and America --
in defiance of international law and customs, unhesitatingly and openly 
exert pressure on the government, the parliament, and public opinion of 
our country by recommending to the parliament that it approve a treaty 
which it did not sign itself and Which is so poorly conceived and composed 
that no one at the present time can doubt its ruinous effect on all of 
Europe." 
Let us elucidate. The speech concerned the usual American maneuver 
designed to compel France to ratify a treaty for the creation of a so-
called "European army." Unprecedented pressure was exerted by Douglas 
Dillon, then American ambassador in Paris, speaking before the Associa-
tion of the American Press in Paris on 29 Jane 1954. Recalling quite 
unceremoniously the dollars Prance received through the Marshall Plan, 
the American diplomat intimidated the French, threatening them with un-
restrained arming of West Germany. Arming for What? In France this was 
well understood, too well. 
Those who knew the hidden circumstances of the matter were not ear-
prised at the statement. Douglas Dillon represented in France not only, 
or perhaps, not so mach the United States as the famous investment bank 
of Dillon, Reed, and Company which has long been connected with the 
German military-industrial machine, financing it and pushing mobilization 
for its OVA capital. Douglas Dillon has given long service to this bank. 
As early as the age of 22 he was a member of the New York Stock Exchange 
and at 29 -- vice-president and member of the board of Dillon, Read, and 
Company, From January 1946 until January 1953, he was its president. 
Receiving the appointment of ambassador to France, he left the bank, 
but maintained close ties with it. In all his activities Dillon was 
governed by its interests.

into What it is today -- a bank which exerts influence on the foreign 
policy of the United States and engages in large-scale internatiOnal 
ventures directed toward the preparation and launching of new world wars. 
According to an American magazine Avert World War III the William 
Reed banking house, located. on Wall Street in New York, quite recently 
wai-eaected from among ten other banks for its significant capital and 
influence on the large financial hierarchies of the United States. Its 
coiveriiOnlnto a plunderer of the first magnitude reverts to that time 
which Clarence Dillon was in the bank. Read entrusted to Dillon the sale 
of Stook at the largest industrial center of the country -- Chicago. 
Dillon zealously undertook thisbrokerage job. A cunning dealer and 
expert 1n the psychology of the American wealthy Who are prepared to go 
to any length for profit, be engaged in several speculations which netted 
large profits not only for, the bank but for himself. Resourcefulness 
and the ability to make a profit under any circumstances were Clarence

. 
lead -bank in New York as its vice-president. The profits of the William 
Readiminking house grew. And Dillon grew. Soon he gained such great 
influence in the bank's affairs that he became its president. 
On the eve of the 1929-1933 crisis the banking house -- now called 
Dillon, Read, and Company -- took the first step on Wall Street in 
spreading out its brokerage operations, whose volume was $3 billion a 
year; 
The Dillon bank quickly found the most profitable field for its 
activities -- it reinvested practically all of its capital abroad. This 
was the bestmethod to penetrate the economies of foreign states, to place 
them at the service of its own mercenary interests, and to assure itself 
fabulous profits. The bank offered loans to Brazil, Holland, and Japan. 
For a Short period it became enmeshed in promissory notes of nearly a 
dozen Latin. AseriCan countries. 
The Dillon, Read, and Company banking house was one of those which 
financed the German military machine revitalized after World War I. On 
5 January 1932 Dillon boastfully declared, "During the postwar period 
the slim total of loans executed through us -- I do not include loans 
executed by other banking houses or in Which we placed small sums -- was 
equal to $1,491,228,549." The statement concerned loans and credit for 
revitalizing the military-industrial potential of Germany. 
The Dillon, Read, and Company bank, together with the National City 
Bank Which belonged to the group of big bosses on Wall Street, served as 
the basic channels through which American financial magnates were in-
vesting in German industry profits made during World War I. Prior to 
1932, these two banks floated 20 German loans in the United States.

HPenetrating into the German economy, whose conversion to a military 
economy had been prepared by Krupp, Stinnes, Thyssen, andSChaeh, the 
banking house of Dillon, Read, and Company together with the Morgans, 
Rockefellers, and other American magnates exerted decisive influence on 
thaTolicy of German monopolies. It is no accident that the head of 
Ferman metallurgical concern, Fritz Thyssen, once declared in answer to 
a question concerning his attitude toward the notorious Dawes Plan kl); 
"My position was determined Chiefly by What an American banker told me. 
I have in mind Clarence Dillon, Who represents the banking house of 
Dillon, Reed, and Company, with which we had quite friendly relations." 
Some time later the same Thyssen published a book in which he related 
with cynical frankness how German monopolies cultivated Hitlerism and 
brought Hitler into power. The book was boastfully entitled "I Paid 
Hitler." 
Not only did Thyssen and Krupp pay Hitler, but also his followers. 
Wall Street monopolists reared fascism and aggression. The financial 
suppOrt of the ruling circles of the United States, by rehabilitating and 
renewing the heavy and military industries of Germany, was the most im-
portant prerequisite to fascist aggression. The Morgans, Rockefellers, 
and Dillons paid Thyssen. Thyssen paid Hitler. Hitler prepared for a 
bloody war of nations.

Several days after the end of World War II two gentlemen appeared 
on the board of directors of the German ferrous metal concern, Pereinigte 
Stalverke in Dusseldorf. One of them with a short, passerine nose and a 
crude haircut with a part, was Paul 1Rite, vice-president of Dillon,

Americaa organization, officially created to determine the extent of 
damages inflicted on German and Japanese industry by Anglo-American 
"strategic" bombers and, essentially, to establish to What degree the 
capital investments of American bankers in these countries suffered.. 
Nitze was vice-chairman of this organization, which was called the 
"Strategic Bombing Survey" (Study of Results of Strategic Bombing). It 
is opportune to point out that this organization affirmed that only 15 
percent of the industrial power of the Fereinigte Stalverke was destroyed 
by bombers. American generals knew where not to drop bombs:

and Company bank had close business connections before the war. As 
his closest advisor he appointed the German financier A. Kreiter, who for 
many years headed the German Credit and Investment Corporation, estab-
lished in 1920 through American loans and Whose obligations were held in 
the United States by the Dillon, Read, and Company bank. 
It is quite interesting that the Kreiter corporation, which was 
closely connected with the Dillon, Read, and Company bank, organized a 
special banking syndicate in 1942 to plunder European countries occupied 
by German Hitlerite armies. Although the snydicate-maraader, which was 
called Societe. du Credit Internationale, was located in Vichy, banks of 
Hitlerite Germany were active in it. 
But let us return to the postwar period. . With the aid of a group 
of people selected by him, Draper entered upon the realization of a Wall 
Street program aimed at disrupting decisions of the Berlin Three-Power 
Conference, which was committed to liquidate Nazi cartels and the German 
military-industrial potential. 
The story of all the intrigues of Draper, Wall Street's deputy, 
would take mach space. We shall limit ourselves to merely a few, of them. 
Omm_of Draper's first moves was the rescue of German war criminals --
leaders of large German financial and industrial monopolies. .How was 
jaie 4onP3 First of all, Draper saw to it that Judges were chosen Who 
:were obedient to Wall Street. Robert Jackson served as chief prosecutor 
At the trials of_ war criminals at Nuremburg. He was a member of the 
United, States?Suprene Court, the same man about whom the famous American 
journalist George Marion wrote: he advised former President of the United 
States Truman ''not to conduct trials of war criminals Who were industrial-
ists in common with Russians, Englishmen, and Frenchmen," because "the 
Russians are unmasking the role of big capital in war and aggression." 
On Jackson's advice, the President announced that the United States would 
conduct this trial separately.

13y that time the selection of judges had. been undertaken by the then 
Assietant Secretary of War, Patterson, who had direct connections with the 
occupation government of West Germany. He was closely connected with the 
ksifilmlafennadildeGaisdadr,[8wEdnel and Wood, which represented., at that 
time in the United States, the interests of the omnipresent German monopoly 
of I. G. Parben and. received large fees for services rendered to it. 
4!, 
Is it no wonder that the American judges selected in such a way 
attempted to relieve their German Wall Street partners of responsibility 
for profiting from wars and imperialistic usarpationl 
In the spring of 1948 the trial of 1RqmaxISchmidt, George von 
Schnitzler, Karl Krauch, Max Ilgner, and others, directors of the I. G. 
Farb= monopoly-octopus, ended. 
The people who headed IGF completely admitted their responsibility 
for the policy of war and aggression conducted by the Hitlerites. Never-
theless, they were adjudged innocent "of crimes against peace and criminal 
conspiracy to wage aggressive war." Merely to calm public opinion, 13 of 
the 22 accused were sentenced to short prison terms. 
How did Draper and his apprentices from Wall Street disrupt the 
program established at Potsdam to liquidate Nazi cartels? 
4 
In September 1947 Martin, former director of the department of so-
called decartelization of the American Military Government in Germany, 
published a series of articles in the New York Post in which he presented 
interesting information on Draper's activities. Martin asserted that 
"reorganisation ?cartels in Germany has been cancelled and an opporta 
nity has been given to Basis to resume their old posts." /t is hard to 
believe, reported the Hay York Post on 8 December 1950, that 20 large 
German steel concerns have become "stronger than ever before." 
Here, for example, is how American monopolists have "revived" the 
German cartel of Robert Bosch, which produces electrical equipment for 
automobiles and aircraft engines. The Daily Compass gave an account of 
this history on I March 1950, 
The Hertsos brothers, who representedBosch's concern in Athena before 
the war, opened the Industrial Products Trading Company in Switzerland. 
Although the Hertsos brothers maintained that they had founded the company 
on their own capital, it was clear that they were dummies.Bdaehv had loaned 
them the basic capital. Thelfosch commercial traTelers permitted Americans 
to take part in this company. Upon the recommendation of one of the offi-
cials of the American, Military Government in Germany, whose name the news-
paper did not give, they enlisted Major General Wilson into the company. 
One-,third of all the company's stock was transferred to him without 
charge. Actually, this was a poorly disguised bribe.

One of the numerous Washington commissions Which investigated the 
activities of the American Military Government in the United States 
summed Wilson for qaestioning in connection with this affair. "How-
ever," wrote the Daily Compass, "the fact was that the general was very 
intimate with Clay (then American deputy in West Germany) and his deputy 
General Hayes." Moreover, Wilson was also intimate with another general, 
Vaughn, aide to former President Truman. His shady transaction was left 
unpunished. 
With the loyal collaboration of German monopolies, who were prepared 
to betray the national interests of the Germany people, American capital 
rushed into the West German economy, capturing its most important sectors. 
The New York Times in November 1949 wrote that the foreign affairs ministers 
of the United States, England, and France received a memorandum from West 
German circles appealing for strengthening of foreign (i.e., American) 
capital in the German steel trust of Fereinigte Stalverke. 
Negotiations were quickly began concerning the transfer to American 
companies ?Du.Pont's General Motors, Morgan's General Electric, and the 
Ford company -- of stock in the Fereinigte Stalverke steel trust in 
Dusseldorf, essential plants of Knapp, the machine building concern of 
Mannesmang,the Otto Wolf concern, and others. 
While Draper and ..Nitze- operated "locally" in the name of profit 
for the Dillon, Read, and Company bank, James Forrestal, former president 
of this bank, ruled in Washington. 
Forrestal obtained viick promotions in the bank. In 1923, seven 
years after his joining this bank, he was joint owner of it. Forrestal 
played a prominent role in credit operations for German heavy industry, 
the basis of the German military.-industrial potential. 
In 1937, he became president of the bank, replacing Clarence Dillon, 
who had temporarily retired from this post. Forrestal used transactions 
with German monopolies to take part in the direction of these monopolies 
and share in their profits. 
In 1941 and 1942 Forrestal, being Assistant Secretary of the Envy 
of the United States, was a member of the board of an American affiliate 
of I. G. Farben -- a company called General Aniline and Film Corporation. 
Before the end of the war Forrestal became one of the chief repre-
sentatives ofAinll Street in Washington who directed the United States 
policy of renouncing international collaborations. In May 1944 he 
decieively opposed ideas for establishing an international organization 
of peace and security, about which negotiations were then being conducted 
which would lead subsequently to the founding of the UN. Forrestal 
declared plainly that "the basis of any new international system ... 
must be the naval and air power of the United States Navy."

Attempting to provide a "theoretical" basis for his aggressive 
activities, Forrestal openly advocated the Hitler "theory" that war 
supposedly represents "the normal state of mankind." 
Such statements were mere hollow declarations. Attempting to 
realize quickly the general plans of Wall Street for militarizing the 
country, Forrestal promoted feverish activity aimed at reorganizing the 
armed forces. Hie efforts to a significant degree made possible the 
creation of the so-called Department of Defense -- the unified center 
which directs the aggressive military machine of the United States. 
James Forrestal was appointed Secretary of 'Defense." In. March 1947, 
urging the Senate Armed Services Committee's swift adoption of a. project 
to combine the armed forces, Forrestal declared that this project "will 
enable the United States to use its entire defensive force against any 
future enemy.. .to insure the agreement of foreign and internal policy, 
the civilian economy, and military demands, and will foresee the cease-
less fulfillment of United States needs for raw materials." 
The international public estimated the true worth of Forrestal's 
feverish activity, which was aimed at militarizing the country, When it 
nicknamed it the "Forrestal war." 
The Dillon, lead, and Company investment bank, with which Forrestal 
Constantly maintained close ties throughout his stay in the Pentagon, 
had long since fulfilled numerous missions for the Rockefellers, the 
American "oil kings." When the Rockefellers organized the Arabian 
American Oil Company (ARMCO) to steal oil riches from Saudi Arabia, a 
company in which there was only one Arabian name, the Dillon, Read, and 
Company bank floated several loans for the Rockefeller oil companies on 
the New York Stock Exchange for $185 million. In one year alone (by 
far not the most profitable) ARANO paid the two Rockefeller companies 
$22 million in profits. At this time a large sum found its may to the 
Forrestal bank of Dillon, Read, and Company. It is not surprising then 
that all of Forrestal's activities smelled strongly of oil. 
While still Amsistant Secretary of the Navy, and later as Secretary 
Forrestal bought oil for the United States Navy from Rockefeller's ARMCO 
at $1.05 a barrel, When it could have been purchased at $0.40 a barrel. 
How mama of this money found its way to the personal account of Forrestal 
remains a secret. 
Forrestalls shady oil transactions caused quite a sensation. Com-
petitors of Rockefeller oil companies opened a campaign arOand these trans-
actions. But, as the New York Post reported on 22 May 1948, Forrestal 
hushed up the affair in the end. It is quite characteristic that statements, 
as a decisive argument against such investigations, were expressed to the 
effect that an investigation leads to the secret sources of American policy

In Bethesda, one of Washington's suburbs, not far from aibreadlhighmay 
rises the sombre, tall, narrow, like an elevator, building of the Naval 
Hospital., Here on a Kay morning in 1949 on the veranda of the third floor 
was' found the body of James Vincent Forrestal. Be had jumped at night 
from an eleventh-story window. Thus did the former president of the 
Dillon, Bead, and Company bank, the great leader of Wall Street, the 
inveterate enemy of peace, the initiator of numerous imperialistic 
ventures of American monopolies end his life. But Forrestalti colleagues 
in the Dillon, Read, and Company bank are continuing his activities, which 
were inimical to the interests of the people. 
The diplomatic office-: of Douglas Dillon in Paris bearing the sign 
"United States Embassy in Paris" is operated in grand style. According 
to an August 1956 issue of United States News and World Revort, the 
staff of this embassy consists of 2,465 people (It). It is located in 
seven buildings and $11.5 million are expended each year for its mainte-
nance. Special telegraph lines connect it directly with American 
0,311;0413stef4 in London, Rome, Brussels1, The Hague, the Scandinavian coun-
tries, Bonn, Tunis, and even Karachi. "The communications system," the 
magazine wrote, "testifies to the scale and complexity of the functions 
of the United States embassy in Paris, which are partially dictated by 
its geographical location in the center of Western Europe. This network 
was created ata time When Paris was the regional headquarters for ful-
fillment of the Marshall Plan, When the United States was expending up 
to $5 billion a year in aid to many European countries. This network 
was expanded when D. Eisenhower directed his activities from Paris While 
creating the KATO army with the aid of billions of American dollars and 
weapons." The magazine noted that many small American missions are also 
found. in Paris, representing 15 US government establishments and organiza-
tions, which fulfill obligations abroad Which the development of events 
demands as, for instance, strengthening American military power in the 
world. "Ambassador Dillon," the magazine concluded, "coordinates the 
activities of all American representatives in Paris." 
The Dillon, Read, and Company bank and its agents weave their in-
trigues throughout the entire world. But the democratic people of the 
entire world keep a vigilant watch over this mischievous activity.

on the -morning of 6 Angust 1945 an American heavy bomber dropped an 
atom bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima. Later a second atom bomb 
was exploded, this time over the city of Nagasaki. Tens of thousands of 
peaceal citizens were killed and maimed. Harry Tram, then President 
of the United States, gave the order for the atom bombing of these 
lapfanfs'i 
course, the barbaric maps killings in, Nagasaki and Hiroshima were 
not provoked. by any military necessity. The bombs were not dropped for 
the purpose of speeding the war's end. There was another purpose here --
to set the stage for atomic blackmail and to intimidate those who opposed 
American plans- to establish the world sapremacy of Wall Street imperialists, 
monbpoly in the field of atomic weapons was viewed by ruling circles 
in the United States as a reliable guarantee that these plans would be 
crowned.with success. But this monopoly had been in existence for only 
a short time, In 1949 the whole world learned that the Soviet Union had 
atomic weapons at its disposal. Soon everyone was convinced that the 
USSR was not only not lagging behind the United States in the production 
of new types of weapons -- atomic and hydrogen -- bat in some respects 
had'OaiStriPped it. 
'-However, this indisputable fact did not sober the American imperial-
ists. They, stubbornly pursued the hazardous "policy of force," the 
strategy of lightning atomic war. Aircraft and weapons of mass annihila-
tion are assigned the role of the striking force. The "air doctrine" of 
war has now become the official doctrine in the United States. "The 
doctrine of the future has been created," wrote Brigadier General D. 0. 
Smith of the United States Air Force in his book Mllitarv Doctrine of the  
Un.t.ted States. '"For the first time in our history the decisive role of 
the Air force has received official acknowledgement." Admiral Bedford, 
former chairman of the American Joint Chiefs of Staff, says that at the 
present iiie-inpdamental emphasis has been placed on the maintenance and 
Ute-Oi6dern aircraft Which is needed above all to perform offensive 
and 6feigive-operations and to sapport other forces. 
, 
Adoption of this doctrine by American imperialism is no accident; 
on the contrary, it reflects the current stage of its development, when, 
for the sake of its own excess profits, American monopolies are prepared 
- 
to commit serious crimes against all mankind. 
"The transition to a strategy of atomic air war," Herschel Meyer, 
a progressive American publisher, wrote in this connection, "completely 
agrees by accident' with efforts of large monopolies to obtain still 
higher profits. Monopolists have discovered that production of ordinary 
munitions provides, a mach lower rate of profit than experimentation,

research, and production of superpower weapons...High military authorities 
in Washington recognize that the Soviet Union cannot be cowered, and 
that it is impossible to hamper four-fifths of mankind living in. Europe 
and Asia and alter their social systems, with guns alone. For this reason 
their aim ts to bring life itself to a standstill by calling forth vast 
destruction by means of hydrogen bombs which can destroy Whole cities in 
an instant. 
? "They hope that war, resulting in vast destruction, will not only 
retard the material growth of socialist countries, but will halt the 
advance of other countries toward socialism; it will secure the preserva-
tion of a status quo; and it will 'convince' mankind that henceforth 
those governments which follow the road to socialism will be plunged 
into war to their. destruction. 
Wall Street's plans for World War III and its decision not to   
par-
ticipate_in land wars and 'not to place great emphasis on infantry,' 
reflect the historical fact that imperialism is losing power on land 
and. therefore entrusts its last hopes to ruling the world from the air." 
The essence of the modern military doctrine of the United States 
443 absolutely clear. In the system of military blocs of modern im-
perialism, the United States has concentrated.in its hands the producT-
tion of powerful strategic aviation and aircraft for delivering atom 
bombs. They plan to use them chiefly from air bases situated around the 
Soviet Union. To their partners in the military blocs the United States 
has entrusted the creation of ground troops, combat or front aviation, 
auxiliary troops, placing greatest emphasis upon the development of 
West German .armed forces. 
.-:Often. repeated in statements of American political and military 
leaders there Is the opinion that American strategy must be based on the 
use of. atomic weapons, as they say, "for tactical purposes," that is, 
wtthin_the limits of battle fields and theaters of military operations. 
What is concealed behind such arguments? Considering the geographic 
remoteness of America, these rulers have considered the fact that atomic 
weapons would find their chief use above all on the territory of Europe 
and certainly far from the industrial centers of America. 
Mexican monopolists seemingly understand the reality of atomic 
counterattacka. and do not object if, in the course of armed conflict, 
millions of people and much that is valuable in countries to Which they 
are allied -- West Germany, Italy, France, England, and others -- are 
destroyed by these death-dealing weapons. 
Can these schemes oft "cunning strategists" be realized? EC, they 
cannot, It is now impossible to wage war without exposing oneself to 
counter blows, If one wants to strike atomic blows on an enemy, then he 
should be prepared to receive the same and perhaps more powerful blows.

The chief threat to peace now comes from the United States. Aggres-
sive circles in the United States do not want peaceful coexistence and 
collaboration among nations, They foster the reckless dream of world 
domination and therefore oppose any disarmament and feverishly prepare 
for var. Their chief stake now lies in building up atomic-aviation arms 
with which they hope to win in a fature war. 
But this stake of aggressive American imperialism can be considered 
nullified, for the Soviet Union, apart from all its other advantages, is 
not only not lagging behind in the field of armaments of this type, but, 
in many respects, has outstripped the United States. The decisive in-
nuance of air forces and antiair defense troops has increased signifi-
cantly with the Soviet Armed Forces. The Soviet Armed Forces now possess 
a sufficiency of different types of atomic and thermonuclear weapons, 
powerful rocket and jet arms of different types, and also long-range 
rockets. The party and government are directing special attention to the 
development of the armed forces as the most important means of ensuring 
the security of our motherland. The first-rate jet aircraft of the USSR 
is capable of solving any tasks which would confront it in the event of 
an, aggressor's attack. 
In spite of everything, however, American monopolists and the military 
clique in the Pentagon by no means want to part with their impossible 
dream of achieving "air superiority." As usual, Senator Richard Russell 
demanded of the United States Congress the creation in the coming years 
of "the strongest air force in the world." With each year, the United 
States government and Congress assign greater appropriations to military 
aviation and different atomic weapons, including intercontinental ballastic 
missiles with atomic warheads. Through the demands of atomic maniacs in 
the Pentagon and the Congress, the post of Assistant Secretary to the 
Secretary of Defense for Guided Missiles was even established, to which 
Edgar Murphy, president of the Esso Research and Engineering Company, was 
appointed. Atomic aviation generals now occupy dominating positions in 
the Pentagon. They cooly formulate plans of atomic war which threatens 
the mass annihilation of people and vast destruction in all countries of 
the world. These generals, closely connected with military-industrial 
monopolies, have gained mach greater influence in the policy of the United 
States. 
Who are these leaders of this "assault" atomic-aviation force which 
is preparing to repeat the crimes committed at Hiroshima and Nagasaki 
for the sake of profits of American monopolistic capital? 
General Twining. General LeMay? General Worsted.

The Pentagon in Washington, Room No 0-929. Behind a desk sits a 
"mem with four gold stars on his Shoulders, with greying hair, but dark-
browed, with a square nose and a large jaw." Such, according to Time, 
is the appearance of General Nathan Twining, chief of staff of the American 
Air Forces. Be did not achieve this high post without reflection: the 
60-year-old professional militarist enjoys the special confidence of Ameri-
can monopolies. The son of a rich banker from the city of Monroe, Wisconsing 
Twining is committed to his class body and soul. A graduate of the United 
States Military Academy at West Point, Twining devoted almost 40 years 
of his life to a military career, of Which 30 were in the air force. 
It is said that the American pilot who dropped the atomic bomb decided 
to end his days at a monastery. But Twining, commander of this operation, 
has seemingly experienced no such pangs of conscience. Arguing furiously, 
he propagandizes atomic war as usual. 
In his first public address (in Dallas, Texas) after his appointment 
as chief of the Air Force, Twining stated that "strategic aviation bombard-
ment of Soviet Russia is more expedient than operations against it from 
the East." 
Like other leaders of the Pentagon, Twining is an ardent proponent 
of the strategy of surprise attack andtka"strike't6tfirst.bldw"With nuclear 
weapons. "Striking-atAlintblole now promises much greater advantages to 
the attacker than ever before," declared Twining in his speech atthe 
congress of the Association for the Air Force in the city of Omaha, 
Nebraska. 
Neither the Soviet Union, nor China, nor other countries of the 
socialist camp have any intention, as is well-known, of attacking the 
United States. They have not built military bases around. America. HY 
talking about the "defensive" mission of American bases on foreign 
territory and about the readiness of the United States to "counterattack," 
American ideologists of atomic aggression want to delude the American 
people and other nations of the capitalist world. 
Twining considers American air bases on foreign soil an important 
weapon for realizing the aggressive plans of the United States. Here is 
what he said in an interview published in United States News and World 
Report: 
"Question: Do you consider it absolutely necessary to have bases 
situated quite close to the territory of the enemy for the purpose of 
performing frequent raids? 
Answer: I consider this highly advisable. 
Question: Does this mean that long-range bombers cannot cope with 
their missions?

Answer; Jaw m,iesion will be more difficult and demand. more time

within aur own, hemisphere." 
The growing defensive might of the Soviet Dili= and the entire camp 
Of democracy will not let the bellicose chief of the American Air Forces 
sleep placidly. Be is compelled to consider this power. His statements 
on this Consideration are quite typical. 
"We, of course, do not know everything about the Soviets," he said 
in the above interview, "but we do know that they are not lagging. If 
they want something and know firmly that they want, in ey opinion, they 
are prepared to go to any length to get it... We of course moist not 
assxne that they are not progressing in the field of long-range aviation, 
too.0 
It amid seem that there is present here a telling, Persuasive 
argument in favor of giving up a "policy of force" and the arms race which 
is ruinous for nations. But no, for Twining and his chiefs this is only 
grounds for farther, more intensive military preparations and continua-
tion of a feverish pursuit after a spectral "military superiority." 
Attempting to convince the peoples of countries in the North Atlantic 
bloc that 4 superior military force ostensibly remains, nevertheless, 
on the side of the United States, atomic-aviation strategists advertise 
such "new" means as gnided atomic missiles. In Twiningls words, work is 
underway in the United States to create an "intercontinental ballistic 
missile" capable of travelling at 10,000 miles an hour. "We must achieve 
the creation of suCh a missile before the Communists." But on 27 August 
1957 4 T464 announcement published in the Soviet press told of the success-
ful testing in the usa of an intercontinental ballistic rocket as well as 
the explosion of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons. 
' Theglight of the rocket," said the announcement, "occurred at a 
very great altitude which, until recently, had not been reached. Traveling 
a tremendous distance in a short time, the rocket fell in an appointed 
area., 
T 
received allowed. :that it is possible to send rockets to any 
region on the earth. The solution of problems in the creation of inter-
continental ballistic rockets makes it possible to reach remote regions 
without resorting to strategic aviation..." 
Atomic war is extremely dangerous for western countries with their 
heavily populated industrial centers concentrated in comparatively limited 
areas. This is fully relevant to the United States, General Twining knows 
this. But he does not care for the people or their interests. The atomic

maniac who dreams of a "push-button war" which he could wage sitting in 
his office, is prepared to sacrifice millions of lives of his compatriots 
to his greedy bosses on Wall Street, who consider war as a means of 
escaping from ruinous economic crises. 
"Even an attack on our large cities," declared Twining, NW matter 
bow terrible, cannot break us. We plan to win the war no matter how 
many Americans might be killed..." 
"This gives little consolation to people living and working in Boston, 
Chicago, Detroit, Washington, and other large American cities," dolefully 
observed the American journalist Shriner, to whom Twining expounded these 
delirious ideas in an interview. 
But these ideas provided General Twining new advancement. On 15 
August 1957, he assumed the post of chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
of tbe United States, that is, the actual leader of all three branches of 
American armed forces.

May and Jane of each year, when the American Congress discusses and 
adopts a budget for the new fiscal year, is a period of especially 
frenzied military hullabaloo in the United States. Especially loud calls 
for strengthening the arms race are raised from the rostrums of both houses 
of Congress and their commissions, and from the pages of newspapers and 
magazines. Air force and other generals, Who distribute government con-
tracts to industrial monopolies for military aircraft, atomic weapons, 
etc., have played a most active role in this propaganda in recent years. 
A significant number of American generals have been transformed over 
recent_years into direct agents of monopolies and their "lobbyists", 
with Whose aid Wall Street receives large military appropriations from 
year to year. Monopolies pay generously for these services. They appoint 
retiring generals to high-paying positions in industrial concerns. 
Examples are not hard to find. All top military leaders of the United 
States Who retired in recent years -- G. Marshall, Douglas MacArthur, 
Bradley, Ridgway,, Van Fleet, Clay, and many others -- now hold "cushy" 
jobs on the boards of the largest industrial monopolies in the United 
States. The incredible salaries Which the monopolies pay them is compen-
sation for valuable services rendered. 
"A?,pew phenomenon after the second world war," wrote the liberal 
Aperican_weekly Nation, "was the mass movement of high-ranking military 
figures, even four-and five-star generals, to private industry, where 
high-paying administrative posts have been prepared for them. Companies 
have done this to hire their influence in military circles.... Thus, such 
a case is possible: an officer on the General Staff of the Air Force

concern, although the airplane, perhaps, has provoked many arguments among 
the experts. Then, two years later, you find that same four-star general, 
now retired, in the post of a hieji-payed president of the corporation 
which manufactures this airplane..." This is one of the examples reported 
in the American press in October 1955. 
Thel4walldr(Xne concluded a contract for delivery of Fai jet 
fighters from the McDonnell Aircraft Corporation and Westinghouse. Al-
though 11 of these airplanes crashed, killing several fighter pilots, 
the contract was continued for some time. An official investigation 
showed. that Rear Admiral Lloyd Inc son, former deputy chief of the Aero-
tantics Administration of the Navy, (now retired) had been opposed to 
revoking the contract, despite the accidents involving the airplanes. 
Re explained that the opinions concerning the production of the companies 
involved were !mad. Bat then, one pleasant day in September 1955, Lloyd 
Nricaon went into retirement and assumed the position of vice-president 
of the McDonnell Aircraft Company. Before a Congressional committee he 
admitted that this position had been offered to him in. March 1955, 
approximately five months before his retirement. 
Just as the now retired generals once strove for monopolies, so 
generals now holding leading positions in the Pentagon are striving, 
with the Air Force generals headed by Twining taking first place. Congress 
appropriated $16.9 billion for the United States Air Force in 1956-1957. 
But for General Twining this was a small mnount. He called this budget 
gstingy." Outfitting 137 regiments of the Air Forces with modern equip-
ment, he declared, requires a significant increase in appropriations for 
aviation, 
Of course, atom-monger-generals who fight for continuation of the 
arms VACS by order of the monopolies are not along. Senators, members 
of the House of Representatives, and also numerous press organs assist 
them. 
Take, for example, such a magazine as United States News and World  
Report. The inveterate wax-monger, D. Lawrence, owns it and is its 
editor. The magazine is closely associated with both the leaders in 
Washington and military-industrial companies, in particular, aircraft 
firms. Tbe latter generously finance this magazine, by publishing adver-
tisements of their own products in it. Being at the same time a foreign 
political reviewer for the New 'York Herald Tribune, Lawrence, like many 
other journalists such as the Alsop brothers and Talbert, who is the 
special military reviewer for that newspaper, eystematically intimidates 
Americans with the threat, fabricated by himself, of a "Soviet air attack" 
and demands greater and greater increases in government expenditures for 
military aviation, atomic weapons, and "intercontinental missiles."

General Curtis LeMay has served in American military aviation for 
over a qmarter of a century. The first seven years he flew in fighters 
and in 1937 selected bombers as his specialty. LeMay commanded a bomber 
squadron of the 8th Air Regiment of the United States in England and 
later was transferred to the Far East theater. It the age of 38 be 
became a major general (this rank correspond to lieutenant general in 
European armies). With the end of the war be commanded the Air Forces 
of the United States in Western Europe. From the end of 1948 until 1957 
LeMay commanded the strategic air force of the United States. Now he is 
deputy Chief of the American Air Forces. 
'rl'he headquarters of the Strategic Air Command is located at Offut 
_Air Base near the city of Omaha. From here the headquarters directs a 
bread network of American bomber bases situated on United. States territory 
aid. abroad, on the territory of countries dependent on the United States. 
American pilots and crews of medium and heavy bombers are trained on 
these bases. 
:Time stated that the American air force is preparing for bombing 
raids. 
? It turns oat that crews of airplanes of the Strategic Air Command 
"describe. arcs of greater circles around the earth every day, in any 
weather, at altitudes of 12 kilometers and more, training and increasing 
tbeir 
"Once every three months," wrote Time, "the crew of each airplane 
performs a fatiguing training flight over a distance equal to that between 
the United States and Russia, and back. This is a realistic exercise to 
test the condition of flight personnel.... Each of the crews now has a 
definite objective assigned to him in Russia or in other countries. The 
pilots mast know by heart and to the smallest detail everything which con-
cerns the fulfillment of their future mission in bombing these objectives 
and in returning the airplane to one of the American bases. Like his 
chief, Twining, LeMay is an advocate of the theory of the "strike the 
first blow." 
.A correspondent of the British newspaper Daily Mirror, who visited 
the Offut Air Base in February 1955 told about the atmosphere of war 
hysteria rihich reigns in the headquarters of the Strategic Air Command. 
and about the frantic war propaganda which is spread among pilots. He 
wrote, "The headquarters of the Strategic Air Command is located in 
Omaha in the very center of America.... Here doctrines supporting world 
superiority by means of aviation are studied, developed, and boldly 
enunciated... The first and most important responsibility of the 
Strategic Air Command is that it be in a state of readiness at any moment 
to begin a full atomic war. It could begin operations against Russia with-
in two hours....

?."1,1t has never ,occurred to American pilots to doubt who their enemy 
might be in time of war. It is Communiet Russia, Communist Russia, and 
0ACtleOre ComMUnist Russia. They are absolutely concentrating their 
attention_q4 the SovittJanion and speak out against the Soviet Union." 
,The Britt& correspondent might easily be convinced that in General 
LeMay he is dealing with one of the most zealous advocates of "preventive" 
war. 
LeMayls blunt calls for unleashing atomic aggression jarred even 
this worldly-wise journalist of a bourgeois British newspaper. "I told 
him," wrote the correspondent later. "that many of us in England consider 
that 10 hydrogen bombs dropped on 10 of our largest cities will undoubtedly 
destroy us, and we will be out of the war for good. I further said that, 
in our opinion, as soon as nuclear weapons are used we will be drawn into 
the war and that such a prospect is hardly attractive." 
" 
The uneasiness expressed by this British journalist, and shared by 
the wide masses of British people, is completely valid. England is now 
one of the chief centers of concentration of Strategic Air Command bases. 
More than 24 air bases, on which are deployed two Air Force divisions and 
other similar units totaling 45,000 soldiers and officers, are located 
in the British Isles. Brigadier General Stevenson, commander of one of 
these divisions (the 49th), declared in 1954 that his division was 
equipped with bombers designated for atomic strikes on the Soviet Union 
and that this mission was assigned to the division two and one-half years 
before. 
Otevensonts admission attracted the attention of the British public 
to the throat lihich .the presence of the Mr Force bases of the American 
aggressors Om their soil represented to the security of England. The 
BritiehMilitary writer, Liddell Hart, who has no special sympathy for 
the Soviet Pailla, gave this wise advice: "If American leaders want to 
start hurling atom bombs, our leaders must demonstrate greater wisdom 
in order to-Xeetraim them from this ... He who lives in a glass house 
should not throw stones." 
The network of American Air Force bases is expanding each year not 
only in England but in other countries of Western Europe. While the 
impudent frankness of the ZeMays, Stevensons, and other American militarists 
have 40.tunmasIced it, American propaganda is prone to depict these bases as 
a harmless means of 4ofonoo", against mythical threats. 
Thispropaanda is spread for purposes of deceiving the people. Every 
sensible person understands that United States Military bases situated 
around the USSR, China, and countries of the people?s democracy were not

created, for defense because they are situated for mew from the Objectives 
which they must defend. These bases were created., of course, for purposes 
of aggressive strategy and for delivering blows with atomic aviation. 
According to information which is far from complete, the United 
States has no less than 100 air bases on foreign soil. There are espe-
-dially.mamy bases in Western Europe. Within the blessing of the council 
-6f the aggressive North Atlantic Bloc (NATO), which adopted a decision 
in December 1954 on preparing for atomic operations in a future war, all 
these bases and the air units stationed on them have now been rebuilt 
in conformity with "atomic," that is aggressive, offensive strategy 
founded on the use of mass annihilation weapons. These American bases 
and; their airplanes were aimed at preparing for atomic war long before 
the NATO council's decision was made. It was no accident that the ruling 
circles in Washington entrusted the command of all these bases to a third --
after Twining and LaKay -- inveterate atom-monger from among the Air Force 
generals -- Lauris Norstad. 
* * * 
The bloody atomic slaughter, Which cost the lives of thousands of 
peaceful Japanese citizens, brought satisfaction to the ambitious efforts 
of 50-year-old General Norstad. "Tall, lean, with the appearance of a 
Hollywood film actor, Norstad was a first lieutenant when the Basis in-
vaded. Poland. By the end of the war he was a major general," wrote 
Newsweek. Now Norstad wears the four stars of a full general. Until 
recently he occupied the position of deputy supreme commander-in-chief 
of the Air Forces, and now he is supreme commander-in-chief of NATO armed 
forces in Europe. 
Located at his headquarters in Wiesbaden, West Germany, Earstad 
took an active part in putting together an aggressive military bloc in 
Western Europe, and in. preparing West Germany's involvement in it. Each 
year he conducted large-scale maneuvers of air units of the United States 
and its West European satellites, achieving coordination of operations 
among them and their eventual consolidation into one air army under the 
American command. His chief demand was "More basest" "The construction 
of new bases and the modernization of those now in existence is the chief 
task which stands before me," Norstad declared in 1951. The general 
lamented that the creation of a network of bases was still proceeding 
"very slowly." "He considers that the chief fault lies in politics," 
wrote Newsweek in a feature story devoted to Norstad's activities, meaning 
by "politics" the resentment of social circles in Western European coun-
tries against American occupation. Narstad admits, the magazine dis-
closed, .that there is a very strong sentiment in Prance against any type 
of system of "European command."

For this Peas= orstad demanded that American diplomacy exert greater 
pressure on the governments of Western European countries in order to 
break the resigtauce of their peoples to the building of American bases. 
Washington pressured, and more circles with symbolic images of airplanes 
appeared on the map of Western Europe. The French, West German, and 
Belgian peasants left their homes of many years, tore down their villages, 
and conxerted their fields and pastures into airfields to which the newest 
American planes, together with maintenance personnel, soldiers, and officers, 
came from the United States. 
The replacement of General Gruenther in the post of supreme commander-
in-chief of NATO armed forces in Europe by General Norstad is new evidence 
that American strategists are shifting their chief emphasis to an atomic-
hrdrogen war. 
Norstad. had hardly received his new appointment when he demanded 
"further strengthening of NATO's military might." Speaking at a press 
conference in Key 1956, he welcomed the decision of the United States 
to *apply armed forces of the North Atlantic bloc with new atomic weapons 
and emphasized that he considers the accelerated rearmament of West 
Germany one of NATO's Chief tasks. "It is vitally important," he declared, 
"that Germany fulfill her military obligations as soon as possible. The 
slow rate of rearming Germany is one of the weak points in the military 
might of NATO." Norstad belittled in every possible way the new peaceful 
act of the US54 -- the reduction of the Soviet Union's armed forces by 
1,840,000 men. 
In contract to tbe coerce martinet LeMay, General Norstad at times 
loves to discuss his "ideological principles." He once said that "modern 
wars are waged not over boundary lines or economies, but over philosophical 
principles." Victories, he declared, are gained not by armed forces alone 
and, although economic aud military power "can be a basic ideological knock-
out, the only weapon against any idea is a better idea." Norstad, never-
thelessuissilept about what kind.of "philosophical principles" or ideas 
he holds 
TheAdeas,which inspire the people of our times are well-known: 
ideas of peace, cessation of the "cold war," and revival of international 
confidenceiy ending the arms race, liquidating foreign military bases 
on foreign salt and banning atomic and thermonuclear weapons. The realiza-
tion of these 'ideas is now being achieved by the governments of the Soviet 
Union, China, and other countries of the democratic camp. 
The "ideas" of Norstad and other American militarists, together 
with ruling circles in the United States, are unremitting international 
tension, a "policy of force," brandishing an atomic bludgeon, inter-
ference in the internal affairs of other countries, and subordinating them 
to American. monopolies. American generals are trying to educate American 
soldiers and officers in the spirit of these "philosophical principles" of 
international robbery.

The American command is more afraid of ideas which reign Over the

"is the simultaneous state of mind and precious qualities which Nat 
Twining tries with all his might to develop in pilots. A good pilot is 
a tiger; a very good pilot -- a hungry tiger. At one of the flying

But the habit of American "aces", as Time irreverently calls them, 
is still not an indication of a high fighting capacity, 'Which is ineon, 
04iyabli without deep ideological conviction, Without unshakable trust 
in the righteousness of onels cause. And thisis the very thing:Which 
American pilots or the American Armed Forces as a whole, do not and can-
not have. American pilots committed unprecedented atrocities in Korea, 
but this did not save them from defeat. For this reason even the American 
press, in all its attempts to provide a strong advertisement for the 
American Armed Forces and above all the Air Force, was compelled time 
after time to admit that the "morale" of American troops is very low. 
Baldwin-, Military reviewer of the New York Times, acknowledged that ."there 
is not enough enthusiasm" even among military cadres. Luring the war 
in Korea, he dolefully narrated, it was revealed that 200 officers of 
the American Air Force, rebelling, refused to take part in combat 
sorties. Military service in the United States, Baldwin admitted, "is 
ideal for only a very small number of young men." In this regard, Time 
bitterly lamented the shortage of cadres in the Air Force. It cited 
the follOWing comment of General LeMay concerning the Strategic Air 
Command; "This entire machine can fall to pieces and fly off in every 
direotion in two Weeks." The reason? "People," the general answered 
bluntly. 
The policy pursued by the rUling circles of the United States of 
preparing for a new atomic war is unpopular among the American people. 
Like other peoples, American Workers Want peace; they know that atomic 
war Wthild bring them incredible disaster. Millions of Simple People 
around the world, including America, are firmly resolved to snare insti-
gators of a new war and prevent them from putting their bloody projects

activity hides the hand of Allen Dalles. This is the business of his 
accomplices from the Central Intelligence Agency which he heads in 
Washington. 
An enormous staff of spies of the most varied specialties and masters 
of diversion and sabotage are active within the system of CIA. 
The activities of this headquarters of the American intelligence are 
Shrouded in deep secrecy. For purposes of conspiracy, the agency is 
located in 34 small, isolated buildings in Washington and 22 email 
buildings in New 'fork. As evidenced in Ameridan newspapers, the names 
of not only supervisors of separate services and Dulles' deputies, bit 
even the rank and file employees of the Central Intelligence Agency, are 
kept secret. 
Row many agents, large and small, work in CIA is not known. In the 
opinion of the more informed US newspapers this agency has 15,000 people 
at its disposal, including employees at headquarters and agents in the 
foreign network -- an entire division of spied. Information concerning 
the budget of this sinister agency is not published. But several US news-
papers have reported that secret appropriations for its operations reach 
one billion dollars a year. Hundreds of millions of dollars Are officially 
and specifically earmarked for financing espionage, sabotage, and subversive 
activities in countries of the aapp of peace, democracy, and socialism. 
A. the US press has reported, for purposes of concealment, appropriations 
for "activities" of CIA are allocated by Congress within the badgets of

In January 1953 the Washington Post, disturbed by comments unfavorable 
to US policy which were stirred by provocative activities of CIA abroad, 
published an article which sharply criticized its methods. The newspaper 
declared in plain terms that CIA was engaged in "black," that is, false 
provocative propaganda. "CIA serves as a refuge for dare-devel cutthroats... 
Through their activities these masters of their trade," the Washington Post, 
pointed out, "are able to start the ball rolling in the field. of foreign 
policy -- to cause trouble and even involve a country in war." These are 
the affairs of Allen Dulles' agency.

Intensifying preparations of the US military machine for a new world 
war, .of Which banks and military-industrial concerns are dreaming, the 
US Congress is 1947 passed the so-called law on national security. Then 
:and there the narrow-minded military cabinet, the Rational Security Coun-
cil. Was created. 
What does this cabinet do? What state matters does it settle? In 
October 1950 the Council examined the general problem of the five-Tear 
program of the "Cold War" against the Soviet Union and Countries of the 
people's democracy. As newspapers then reported, it was decided that the 
US would spend 200-250 billion dollars over a five-year period on armaments, 
assist in the creation of a "European argryn of 75 divisions, and supply 
arms to countries located on the borders of the "Soviet zone." 
? Here, based on the information from the US press, is snot of prob-
lems on Which the Council labored during 1953: an embargo on maritime 
shipments to the Chinese People's Republic; a complete ban on trade with 
"Communist countries"; plans to interfere in the war in Indonesia; And the 
military budget. According to reports by the American press, the decision 
concerning the anti-national revolution in Guatemala was made at a meeting 
Of the National Security Council on 17 June 1954. The Council ratified 
a program for sharply expanding the US armed forces. 
Many aggressive plans have been approved at meetings of the National 
Security Council. In May 1954 the New York Post told of a meeting of the 
Council at Which the plan for US operations in Indochina was discussed. 
At this very meeting the decision was made to create an aggressive military 
coalition of colonial powers (the so-called "South-east Asia Pact -- SEATO"). 
In the beginning of June of that year plans for expending and continuing 
the. war in Indochina were examined here. 
Thus, the Council determines the foreign and military policies of 
:the, US and coordinates the activities of US diplomacy and the military 
machine. 
How does one explain the narrow-mindedness of its members? Why are 
the leaders of the US government, with the exception of the secretaries 
of State, Defense, and the Treasury, not always permitted to take part 
in its discussions? Because matters dealt with at the meetings of the 
Council are top secret. The National Security Council long age became 
-a hotbed of plans for subversive, sabotage activities. For this reason 
the Central Intelligence Agency and its leader, Allen Dulles, play s) 
important a role in the affairs of thii Council. 
The journal United States News and World Report acknowledged that the 
reactionary revolution in Guatemala was brought about through the efforts 
of CIA. Other organs of the US press announced that the intervention in 
Guatemala -- inspired, organized, and supported by the US -- was for a

then that, "Allen Dulles -- head of the Central Intelligence Agency....

Newsweek wrote. "He was not sarprised by the events resulting in the 
collapse of the Arbens government." When it appeared that the situation 
of the Guatemalan government was completely stable, Peurifoy asked if 
disorders would. soon break out. "I will not indulge in predictions," be 
said, "but I will tell you one thing. We are now preparing invitations 
to our Fourth of july reception and we will not include one iember of 
the present government on that list." In plain terms the London Times  
declared that Peurifoy "operating behind the scenes, contributed math,. 
to the ,overthrow of the Arbens government." 
, 
Adapting to a new situation, the National Security Council in the 
fall W 2.9,56 approved, in the words of the US press, the idea of expanding 
contacts with the Soviet,Vni.on in the field of culture and art, with the 
obvious, openly stated purpose of using these contacts in the interests 
of US intelligence agencies. 
?Ihrw.gh the active participation and incitement of US intelligence 
agencies the anti-national mutiny of the Hungarian counterrevolution was 
organized,. To _a great degree it resulted from rabid, malicious urgings 
on t,440 part of _such US propaganda organs as the Voice of America and 
-114410 Pree_Europe, which are financed, according to the US press, by the 
US, espionage and sabotage agency. .Such authoritative press organs as the 
Chicago Daily News and others were compelled to acknowledge the subversive 
role of these radio services and their connection with US intelligence. 
-J1 
With the first shots of the fascist putschists resounding in Budapest, 
CIA in Washington began working at full speed. General Donovan, former 
head of US intelligence during World War II, was quickly sent to Vienna. 
His task consisted of supplying arms to the fascist putschists and organ-
izing assistance and support for them. Acting under the guise of leader 
of the se-called International Rescue Committee, Which coordinated and 
directed the activities of the emigrant, fascist remnants, Donovan roamed 
along the Hungarian borders looking for less protected points through 
which it would be possible to supply the poorly armed counterrevolutionary 
bands whiol; were stirring up revolt against the national power. They 
attempted to. impose on the Hungarian people the power of Hungarian and 
foreign capitalists and landowners, the power of Horthy, listerhazy, and 
the obscurantist Mindszenty.

Ile counterrevolution collapsed. It was blocked by the Hungarian 
people with the brotherly support of the Soviet Union. Donovan returned 
to Washington with nothing for his pains. But in an interview with press 
correspondents he again urged that arms be supplied the fascists. As 
evidenced in the Washinaton Daily News, in answering the questions of 
correspondents, Donavan declared that the best means of assisting the 
Hungarian revolutionaries was "to supply arms to those who are still 
fighting." In answer to a similar question he urged the US to do every-
thing in order that "the battles in Hungary would continue." 
In all these operations of the Central Intelligence Agency a dominant 
role was played by Allen Dulles -- banker, diplomat, and leader of the 
agency Which united and coordinates all types of American military, politi-
cal, diplomatic, and)aconomic espionage. The activities of this sinister 
agency of espionage, sabotage, and terrorism are directed not only againet 
countries of the camp of peace and democracy, bat against the satellites 
and "allies" of the US.

By a military agreement concluded between the US and Thailand in 
October 1950, a large center of US espionage was created there. Sheldon, 
the US Military Attache, supervised it. Special courses for training 
US agents are given in Chiang Mai in the northwestern part of Thailand. 
All espionage work in Thailand was headed by the hardened intelligence 
officer, Genera1U-rsicthaaman,who served there until recently as ambassador. 
Agents of the US espionage service operate everywhere including the 
territories of US allies -- Britain, Prance, Italy, and other countries --
to the detriment of their national interests. 
It is no accident that Allen Dulles, a specialist in international 
ties of American monopolies, heads this ramified system of espionage, 
proVecation, and sabotage. Wall Street has always given great attention 
to international espionage. As regards Allen Dulles, being in the service 
of American banks, he long ago became famous as a scout of monopolistic 
US capital. 
* * * 
"Allen Dulles," the New York Times Magazine once announced, "began 
his activities in the field of espionage almost immediately after his 
graduation from Princeton University. This was in 1916 when, as a 23-
year-old employee of the US Embassy in Vienna, he was commissioned to

to swim contact with dissident forces (i.e., dissenters) in Austria." 
The fasten Post reported that Allen Danes brought with him into 
CIA imagination and. zeal plus a bent for adventure.* 
Biographies of Allen Dulles assert that from his birth he was pre-
pared. for diploiatic pursuits. Dulles? grandfather, John Watson Foster, 
served. as Secretary of State under President Harrison and. earlier was US 
emissary to Mexico and Tsarist Russia. Allen Dulles' uncle, Robert 
Lansing, a great advocate and. attorney of Wall Street monopolies, served. 
as Secretary of State under President Woodrow Wilson. 
In 1910 Allen D.t11es was admitted into the US diplomatic service. 
Secretary of Hmbassy in Vienna, Bern and Berlin, and finally chief of 
the Near last Section of the State Department -- such was the impetuous 
ascent of Dulles up the ladder of the US diplomatic service. 
In. 1926, appointed adviser of the US Embassy in Peking, Dulles 
resigned and. entered the law firm of Sullivan and Cromwell, one of whose 
owners was his older brother, John Foster Dulles. 
J. 
Ap firm of Sullivan and Cromwell established a reputation as legal 
steward of many US monopolies and banks. La_ r, the US trade union news-
paper, reported that a fee of millions of dollars was nothing remarkable 
for this firm. Lawyers of Sullivan and Cromwell formed cartel agreements, 
loan. operations, mergers, and. reorganizations of large monopolies. Before 
the almond %rid Mar, the firm of Sullivan and Cromwell actively assisted 
the Bri,tish affiliate of the German banking house of Schroeder in inten-
sifiring its financial operations in the United States and. expanding its 
Hex ToFk`akfiliate, the John Henry Schroder and Company Bank. John 
Poitir. and. Allen Dulles, Partners and. co-owners of this firm, became 
board. members of the New York Schroder Bank. 
Sitting solemnly in an office of the firm? s bailding on Wall Street, 
Allen Dulles did not lose touch with the diplomatic machinery of the US. 
In. 1,927 he WEI legal adviser to the US delegation at the three-power 
maritime conference. His duties included preventing anyone from limiting 
the siale and ,sphere of operations of the US Navy to which the oil empire 
of lioc,ksfe3.1er supplied many millions of barrels of oil. Dulles also 
serves). ALdAr 1,tier to US delegations at disarmament conferences in 1932 
and. 1933. If one is to judge by the results of these conferences, which 
prometed not one iota of armaments reduction, Dulles and. his colleagu.es 
on the delegations fulfilled. the order of American monopolistic capital 
which attempted, thereafter to make a fortune in arms production. 
The exploed.on of imperialistic contradictions, which kindled the 
flame s;tf the World War II, aroused. great uneasiness on Wall Street. 
Monopolies wanted. to conceal from the public their Secret ties with the 
criminal German concerns which fostered. and unleashed the war, and at the

sometime maintain these ties in order to divide the profits with German 
monopolies after the war. Not only US banks were concerned with this 
problem, but German monopolies as well. At this time, in October 1942, 
Allen Dulles was sent by DB monopolies to serve in the US intelligence 
orgaditation, OSS -- Office of Strategic Services. He was swat to one 
of the most important areas, to head the OSS section in Basel. 
This selection was no accident. Located in. Basel was the so-called 
International Savings Bank, created in. 1926 in connection with the 'Young 
Plan" for effecting operations between German military industrialists 
and the US and British banks Which financed them. Three German bankers 
sat on the board of this bank daring the war: Baron Kurt Von Schroeder, 
president of Hitler's Reichebank; Walter Funk, minister of the German 
econoty;-andHermaniSchmidt, president of I. G. larbenindmetrie. The 
US bank we represented by three members of its board. The Well Street 
deputy in this bank was its president and chief director, ThomotMaittrick 
representing the Morgan. First National Bank of New York. 
Q. D. White, then special consultant to the secretary of the US 
treasury, gore an evaluation of the activities of this bank. "Germans 
control it," he declared on 23 November 1943. "The American president of 
the bank conducts business with Germans, While at the same time our 
soldiers struggle with Germans on the fields of battle." In the yammer 
of 1944Aolittrick himself told a United Press correspondent the following: 
"We will not permit the machine to stop. You know that when the armistice 
comes, former enemy powers may be in great need of such a powerful tool as 
the International Savings Bank." 
To this one could add that "enemy powers" also needed the bank during 
the war. It was mainly throne* this bank that German monopolists estab-
lished contact with Allen Dulles during the period when the inevitable 
destruction of Germany on the Soviet-German front became evident. 
In February 1943 (after the defeat of the Germans at Stalingrad) 
none other than Allen Dulles, going under the less attractive nickname 
"Bull," conducted on behalf of the US government negotiations with Prince 
M. Mohonlohe, Who was close to the ruling circles of Hitler's Germany 
and acted as Hitler's representative under the nickname "Peals." 
Dulles, wielding great power, assured him that "the German state 
must continue to exist as a factor of order and rehabilitation." Re-
peating Hitler's nonsense, Dulles declared that "the expansion of Poland 
to the east and the preservation of Rumania and a strong Hungary would 
serve_to,aupport the creation of a cardon sanitaire against Bolshevism 
and Panalavism." Thus Dulles acknowledged the claim of German industrial-
ists to. supremacy in Europe. Notes of a conversation discovered among 
documents of the Gorman Ministry of Foreign Affairs state that "Bull is 
more or less agreeable to the state and industrial organization of Europe

onj4ebasis ofjarge areas, suggesting that a federated Greater Germany 
(like_the,US) with a Danabe confederation joined to it will be the best 
guarantee of order and rehabilitation of Central and Eastern Europe." 
HeieLzihen is recognition of Hitlerss fundamental plans for "organizing" 
Europe.. 44s, daring the war Mr. Allen Dulles labored over the realiza-
tion of such adventurtstic_plans in Basel. 
e _purpose of these plans was to reach agreement with the Hitlerites 
_gond:440 a_separate peace with them in order to preserve the German 
millitaryrmachine, save it from destruction by Soviet troops, and nee it 
in, theLdtre against the Soviet Union. 
BIt_was hoped to realize this sabotage by organizing an attempt on 
Hitlarls life and staging a "coup" in Berlin. For this purpbSe Dulles 
keptim-touch with prominent figures close to Hitler. According to the - 
,11,P press, Allen Dulles was informed of all plans for the Attempt on 
Hitler's like" through Giesevias, German vice-counsel in Bern. 
After the war Dulles headed the OSS section in West Genie:my'. %is 
duties were to strengthen and expand the position of US capital in the 
0l-man-economy. Speaking at a meeting of US bankers in November 1946, 
Dulles declared: "We mast play a leading role in the rebirth of the 
German economy in order to stabilize the economic position of the 'US 
by establishing control over the German economy and assuring US firms of 
Actlittrable profits." 
Fulfilling this task of US monopolistic capital, Alien Dulles had 
not forgotten his own personal, mercenary interests. With the active 
Assietance and cooperation of the Nazi bankers Schacht and Schroeder-, 
he bought up shares of enterprises excluded by control groups of the 
Amerioanlxmit of the supreme commission of the I. G. Parben and Verein,i, 
igte Stahlwerke concerns.

agency conducted their subversive sabotage work with great thoroughness. 
More fandswerkallocated,to_Dalless CIA than to the State Department; 
the most qualified cadres of the various US espionage services were 
placed at his disposal. 
, 
Central Intelligence Agency", the journal Colliers once. reported 
to OA 1719adeTe, "is an. agency consisting mainly of intelligence officers 
of tie Arm, Navy, and Air Force intelligence services. Their diplomats 
and attaChes send from countries in which they are accredited allinforma, 
tion_Which they gather in these countries... CIA is commissioned to hire, 
train, and place in foreign countries secret agents who mast perform 540 
percent of the dirty work connected with intelligence."

"CIA," Colliers related, "plants its people in other countries as 
consulate workers and other less important official representatives." 
The journal gave examples of CIA leaders publicly announcing "Who their 
agents were in an embassy and what posts they occupied." 
It is an interesting circumstance that When Allen Dulles was appointed 
chief of the OSS section in Switzerland during the war, according to the 
New York:Times Magazine, "he was, for cover purposes, held to be a special 
assistant to the US ambassador in Bern." 
The military reviewer of the Now 'fork Times once wrote that there 
are many CIA spies among US workers abroad. "Representatives of CIA 
abroad," wrote Baldwin, "An every case are in fact connected 
to US embassies and usually avail themselves of State Department communica-
tions." 
The "means of communication of the State Department" are at the dis-
posal of the organizers of espionage, sabotage, provocations, and revolts. 
For purposes of concealment they are listed as diplomats at US embassies 
and are authorized to "hire, train, and place secret agents in foreign 
governments." 
Allen Dulles' agency makes wide use of this ramified system of 
espionage and sabotage to shover the territory of the Soviet Union and 
other countries of socialism with its agents, who are elpplied with arms, 
Counterfeit documents, poison, ciphers, and secret radiotranamitters for 
reporting information from spies. Captured and exposed agents of US 
-imperialism, as well as those agents Who gave themselves up to the 
motherland and were thereby pardoned, recently told the Whole world about 
their foul activities. Their stories have taught the Soviet people to 
maintain sharp-sighted, watchful vigilance against the intrigues of 
enemies of peace and happiness of peoples. 
, Alt the ruling saboteur in Washington is not only occupied with 
plotting secret espionage activities. The organization of a police 
service and the struggle against national movements throughout the entire 
capitalist world are also subjects of his concern. 
In October 1955 Dulles addressed the 65th annual congress of the 
International Association of Police Chiefs (it so happens there is such 
an organization) with an appeal to study the police business in order to 
be ever ready to crash the onslaught of national forces everywhere. 
The conference of heads of governments of four powers in Geneva in 
1955 had hardly concluded when Allen Dulles demanded, "Don't yield to the 
spirit of Geneva."

In the interval between hi narrow, departmental activities the 
younger Dulles supervised the state of affairs in the field of atomic 
and naclear arms. In June 1956 be accompanied Admiral-Banker Lewis 
Strauss, head of the US Atomic Energy Commission, to the Pacific Ocean 
area Where US atomic and hydrogen bombs are tested. 
'Tension 1.1.1 international relations is relaxing. Socialist and 
workers parties are making new steps toward unified action in the struggle 
against reaction, poverty, the armaments race, high taxes, and the danger 
of war. But Allen Dulles is dashing around to the Congressional commis-
sion for investigating "un,American activities." In a speech published 
on 1 September 1956 he demanded, "How it is impossible to ignore the 
danger of parliamentary compromises with Communists." 
The hated system of colonialism is crumbling. The peoples of Asian 
countries led by an impassioned striving for peace, a better life, for 
science, light, state independence, And soveriegnty, are uniting in a 
zone of peace. Allen Dulles is not sitting placidly in Washington. In 
September 1956 he set out on a round-the-world tour. His itinerary 
included India, Indonesia. Australia, the Philippines, South Korea, and. 
Japan. Oddly enough the capitalist press writes very little on the con-
crete purposes of this trip. The Indian newspaper Blitz gave a Slight 
glimpse into the deep secret behind this Voyage. Allen Mullet:: and his 
associates, the newspaper noted, travelled through countries of Southeast 
Asia and the Par East in order to reorganize the activities of the Central 
Intelligence Agency on the basis of "materials" obtained locally. 
But this tour of the master of provocation and sabotage has not found 
syMpathy and approval. His airplane had no more than landed at Djakarta 
when representatives of official Indonesian circles promptly announced 
that A. Dulles was not a guest of the Indonesian government. It is very 
necessary to soothe public opinion Ada& is aroused and incensed by the 
appearance of an old enemy of the Asian people. It is possible, perhaps, 
to appease public opinion temporarily, but it is impossible to decette 
the watchfulness of the people who vigilantly protect their own achieve-
ments. 
The perspectives of Mr. Allen Dulles and his agents are joyless: 
espionage, sabotage, and other means of waging of Wall Street's secret 
war Cannot be effective when nations resist them. A saboteur can destroy 
a dam and poison water in a well, but he will never succeed in destroying 
the inviolable will of people for a new, bright life and returning them 
to slavery under the masters of the Dulleses and their bosses on Wall 
Street. No matter how Allen Dulles and his division of agents try, 
their activities are inevitably doomed to failure.

Refuse trade with the Soviet Union and countries of the people's

In the guise of creating "international volunteer forces," launch 
an armed invasion into Hungary. 
All these suggestions were loudly and openly proposed by Senator 
Knowland of California in November 1956 when a wild, provocative campaign 
against the Soviet Union was waged in the United States and other coun-
tries of the Atlantic military bloc, in connection with the failure of a 
counterrevolutionary revolt in Hungary. Indeed, this senator had proposed 
such suggestions many times earlier, advancing implacable, aggressive, 
misanthropic appeals. Any circumstances and events regardless of their 
character or trend were used for this purpose. Senator Knowland grieved 
at tidings of the strengthening of world peace and rejoiced at each 
aggravation of international relations. He is, in the fall sense of the 
word, the most thick-headed, inflexible preacher of preventive, that is, 
a completely uncalled for but in his opinion "necessary," war against 
the camp of socialism and democracy. 
Rowever, it would be a mistake to view the senator from California 
as some kind of "crank," "eccentric," fanatic, or even a ludicrous amateur 
in politics of the United States of America. No, this prominent figure 
of the Republican Party, the leader of its faction in the United States 
.Senate is'one of the most influential members of the ruling groups in 
this country. He expresses his pinions more frankly, more rudely, and 
more cynically than officials of the American government. 
Inowland is a phenomenon deserving the public's attention. His 
impetuous career is characteristic of modern America. Such people move 
forward in the United States. The atmosphere itself -- increasing reaction 
in the North Amerioan state, the situation of war hysteria, and the arms 
rade which enriches those Who actually rule America -- gives rise to the 
Knowlands. 
William Pife Knowland is not simply an enemy of peace. He is a 
preacher Of war.

capitalism and. socialism on the earth is "impossible." He furiously 
defends the "doctrine" of political war against the People's Republic 
of China. He has threatened. to resign if China is returned to its 
legitimate seat in the UN. 
No coexistence whatever with Communism is Knowlandls motto. Only 
capitalism, he asserts, mast exist on the earth. As long as somehwere 
in some' Country socialism is building, as long as one nation lives in a 
new way which does not recognize capitalistic systems or the "leadership" 
of the United. States of America, capitalism cannot be confident of its 
future. All historical changes which have taken place in the world since 
the Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia, in the opinion of this 
Senator, must be completely liquidated. He will not agree to anything

It wa,s,hardly, by accident that this "happy o-pportnnityn befell 
ienowland. The capable young go-getter energetically supported the 
Republican governor of the state of California, E. Warren. This su.pport 
had some meaning: William Know3.and and his father, Joseph, controlled. 
the Tribe.ne, an_influentiai newspaper in those areas pu.bllshed in 
Oakland, Warren dAd not forget his sponsors. In appointing Knowlextd to 
the Senate, Warren had. merely repaid his political debt. 
? Thus the advantageous position of his father in state political 
ciiOleS benefited Kn,owlandis life ,and. career: Thus this prospering 
American exploited. the Well-knOwn fact that in the United States the 
preUe belongs to big capitalists, bosses of financial capital and is 
used by them for their own mercenary interests. 
The ee0ond essential circumstance conneCted with the rise and, personal 
_ 
interests .?f the senator lies An the fact that numerous firms in California, 
of which he is even now, considered the director, have always been, interested. 
in the Par East market particularly in China. 
1945, when Knowland became a senator, was not only the year of victory 
over the German and. Japanese aggressors, but also the year of the inten-
sive economic penetration of the United States into China, which was then 
ruled by the Chiang Kai-shek clique. This, vast countxy represented, to 
? American monopolists, a new "Eldorado," an inexhaustible source of profit, 
an almost gratuitous labor force, and a favorable sphere of capital invest-
ment,. One-sided agreements concluded by Chiang Kai-shek with the United 
States government, it appears, transformed China into a semi-colonial 
American territory many decades before. At this point all American com-
petitors were forced out -- Japanese, German, Italian, and., to a large 
degree, British and French monopolies. 
1 
But the first years of Knowland.? s "big" political activity coincided 
with the great anti-imperialistic war of liberation of the Chinese people 
and with, the d.ecisive defeat of the corrupt Kuomintang clique, Which was 
exiled. at last to the island of Taiwan. The senator from California, 
being vitally interested in the profits of American companies which have 
long enriched themselves in China and throughout the Par east, became 
the acimowledged leader of those forces which invariably supported and 
, , 
still support the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which in turn exerts great 
influence on the United States Congress. 
The nickname "Senator from Formosan has stuck firmly to Knowland. 
, 
Together with California plant owners and. bankers, he is interested in 
seeing 'that China never beeomes a free, sovereign country and that it 
remains under tile control of American monopolies as in the past.

the -de9-rooted Opinion that in fighting for a "preventive" war, he 
propoiret; in essence, a War for achievement of American world. supremacy. 
Bit his "refutations" only confirmed this opinion. 
, In it December 1954. issue, the New York Timek Mae,azine published an 
ntervlew,e9it1t1ed "Know/and on United States Foreign Policy." This, 
you please, was the most complete, most frank statement of views on 
this idioloiy of a third world war, barely concealed by hypocritical 
phrases. 
-"A meeting with the Soviet Union on peaceful coexistence," the 
senAtOr' declared in it s interview, "would. be a fatal mistake." Knowland. 
wants neither a meeting nor coexistence itself. And Knowland. did not 
change his position even after the Geneva Conference. On the contrary, 
he began to defend and propagandize it more widely and more violently. 
Why l 3i4acense by the term "coexistence" Comnrunists imply peace and the 
peaetul collaboration of governments of different systems. This is un.-
accePtible for Knowland 'because "coexistence will mean legal and moral 
recognition of the iron curtain which now exists."

These words of the "Senator from Fromosa" on the "iron curtain" 
need. explanation, for not everyone grasps his allegory. In this case, 
by "iron curtain" the senator meant the mon-artificial curtain created 
by imperialistic countries around the states of the camp of socialism 
and democracy. 
Knowlan&opposes "legal and moral" recognition of the camp of 
socialism and democracy, the recognition of the right to life under the 
socialist system. In this sense he formulates his program quite clearly: 
if the United. States agrees to peaceful coexistence between the two 
systems, then, by this fact alone, it renounces the intention of destroy-
ing the other, non-capitalist system. 
This Champion of preventive war wants to "save" the peoples of the 
democratic states from socialism, national democracy, and. national 
independence. Loathsome hypocrier has always been one of the distinguish-
ing dharacteristics of imperialists: they have not committed one crime 
against freedom and independence Of nations, without peiforming masses, 
without praying to God, without proclaiming throughout the entire world 
their devotion to "freedom," "democracy," and "equality." 
Knosaand does not agree with the genuine independence of countries 
of socialism. 
Be wants to "free" them, that is, enslave them. True, to a direct 
question from a journalist, the senator answered cautiously, "This does 
mean, exclustvely liberation by means of armed fordes." Not exclusively, 
hut, it seems, preferably. However, there follows an Oilanation of - 
other !'methods" which differ little from war, althoUgh they are termed 
"establishment of contact" with American secret agents within these 
countries. 
For experienced readers of the New York Times Magazine the senatorle 
Aesopian language is understandable. He blandly and frankly states his 
Opinions. Expanding on the benefits of severing diplomatic relations 
with the USSR and the fact that the United States "does not feel 
animosity" toward the Russian people, Knowland declared that it cannot 
consider the Soviet Union "as having the right to occupy its place among 
law-abiding countries of the world." 
This means the Soviet Union was established "illegally" and that the 
senator does not consent to granting it the "legal" and "moral" right 
to existence. 
This is the first and fundamental point of Knowlandls "program" to 
which all the rest are subordinate.

Senate. In 1951 Knowland. spoke 103 times in defense of Chiang Kai-shek 
and. against the People's Republic of China. In recent' years he has 
found. much greater pretexts for anti-Chinese "hysteria": he was 
"menaced" by the armistice in Korea and fought in every possible way 
against the possibility of its conclusion. However, it became a fact. 
In 1954 he fought against peace in Indo-Chin.a. In spite of the strength 
of the Knowl.Esnds, Indo-China was not successfully converted into a new 
base for aggression against the People's Republic of China.

Edgar Hoover learned his hypocrisy as a child. He industriously 
attended Sunday school and sang psalms. in the church choir. His mother, 
Current Miograohj reports, was a religious woman, "a strong adherent to 
the 'principles of Calvinism.", The future chief aleuth listened to her 
extensive sermons On good aad evil and. dreamed of a career as clergyman. 
These plans were approved by a certain Reverend MacLeod. Mho poured out 
his eloquence upon Edgar. An atmosphere of sanctimonious piety reigned 
in. his home, "We never sat down at the table," recalled Hoover, "with-
out gliing thanks to heaven..." 
In his school years, Current Biosranhv reports, Hoover "refined" his 
comrades' high morals. This, however, did not prevent him from carefully 
preparing his career by directing it on a. path quite apart from theology: 
Hoover's:mother wanted her son to become a minister. 
Finishing university and receiving his bachelor degree and later a 
law degree, Hoover began to clamber stubbornly upward on the ladder of 
? ranks within the Department of Justice. 
He distinguished himself in the shameful Palmer raids in 1919 and 
1920. War and. bitter economic crises stirred up the broad masses of 
American workers. The Great October Socialist Revolution brought the 
ideas of genuine sovereignty to the very shores of America. The rulers 
of ten's minds in the United States -- the Wall Street magnates -7 
resorted to terror. Mass arrests, slaughter, deporting of "radicals" 
began Under the supervision of the Attorney General Palmer. More than 
6,000 people were then illegally subject to police repression. 
Hoover stood behind the scenes of all Palmer's operations. Several 
years ago Kea:Lowenthal, in his book, Tjlel_e_dei_:._4g_BureauofInvestiation, 
bared irrefutable facts of Hoover's active participation in the "Palmer 
raids.," Cummings, former Attorney General in the first years of President 
Roosevelt's stay in office, testified that "under the direct adminis-
Arative leadership of Hoover" in 1919 a "general bureau of investigation" 
was established,' and that the mrgpression of "radicals" was Hoover's chief 
responsibility from the very beginning of his career. Hoover and his 
bureau, which was called the "anti-radical" bureau, began to fill exten-
sPre 4k2es with notes of any rumors and gossip concerning so-called 
"sabversive"_elements. Mass illegal arrests aud deportations in the 
period 101971920 were the first big job for Hoover. He personally 
mxpervieed all these operations and thereby made a career for himself. 
In 1919 Hoover was assistant to, the notorious Palmer, in 1921 -- assistant 
director of the FBI, and since 1924 -- its director. Hoover was then 
only 29 years old. It was not without reason that he received the nickname 
"Smartie" in school!

,Hoover made himself famous in another no lege shameful affair. 
Dating the, first world war American aircraft companies were manufac-. 
tiring wholly unsatisfactory airplanes aptly called "flying coffins." 
Aircraft industry magnates staffed their pockets with dollars as pilots 
were killed. When these unsightly facts became known to the public, a, 
storgrof indignation broke out in the country. But serene calmness 
reigned in the Department of Defense and the FBI. Themis kept silent. 
Attorney General Daugherty and his closest assistants, among whom was 
Edgar. Roover? made great efforts to hush up the scandal of the "flying 
coffins." Just as in the "Palmer raids," Hoover remained in the back-
ground behind the scenes. But his zeal and loyalty to the interests of 
ionoPelies were undoubtedly noted. 
Hoover has held his post continuously for more than 30 years. 
The scent and habit of a police dog, the readiness to serve greedy 
magnates on Wall Street, and hypocrisy and bigotry helped him to retain 
his past through four presidents and ten attorney generals: Republicans 
and Democrats alike need Hooveranntbckhranka tatarist-Rxsiandecretpolitical

services., Congressional appropriations for espionage-information,service 
gr6iilfroM year to year. In 1917 the FBI was forced to be satisfied with 
$618,000. Now appropriations for the FBI run into the millions of dollars. 
, 
-idgar Hoover's hypocrisy, his indelicate ways, and his clever self-
advertisement reached unprecedented heights. .Pages of the American and 
even Western European press are filled with eulogies of Hoover and the 
FBI. 
See what successes Hoover has achieved, the American press would 
have you believe. He cleaned the FBI of criminals 00, he created a 
,"police of a new type," organized a criminal laboratory, and founded the 
"Academy of the FBI" in which "picked police officers from each state 
and Many foreign goVernments" study modern methods of coping with "sub-
versiveeaements." In a word, Edgar Hoover works day and night expanding 
and. extending the system of police investigation and observation over all 
,.Aniericans. 
In the opinion of his newspaper supporters, Hoover merits special 
thanks for creating an extensive collection of fingerprints. In the FBI, 
he boasted, there are even the fingerprints of Eleanor Roosevelt and 
former Mayor of Sew York City, La Guardia. The point here is, of course, 
not in these dactyloscopic souvenirs but in the fact that Edgar Hoover's 
,dspartment firms the foundation of an espionage net which engulfs the 
country.

Dillingervkilled by FBI agents. Next to it is a, law library and a 
'Shooting gallery. On the fifth floor is the office of the boss, humbly 
called the "cave of Winds." Workers in the FBI, relate, and. not without 
some witisfacWm4 that their famous card index contained 116 million

'United States,"that is those who are under surveillance and Whom the 
American okhrnka watches. 
Thousands of simple citizens. Thousands of opportunities to put a 
man to a civil death, to snatch him off the street, and force him to die 
from hunger. Any "differently minded" person in modern America can be 
accused of "subversive" activities. At Hoover's service is the law on 
"internal security," which stipulates compulsory registration of "sub-
versives" and actually all Who are objectionable to the 11,0m of organi-
zations in the Department of Justice. In 1954 the United States Congress 
passed a new law Which declared the Communist Party Illegal. The FBI is 
.completing work on preparations for reprisals against differently minded 
and simple thinking Americans. Hoover and his agents are .gathering 
"evidence," "proof," and ascertaining people's "sentiments." 
How does Edgar Hoover and the okhranka which he heads operate? 
. Entering the FBI, Hoover leaves his mask of a pious Christian, 
democrat, and defender of the American family, together with his hat amd 
coat in the cloakroom. This well-bred gentleman and worthy student of 
Reverend MacLeod has turned into a detective who does not disdain to use 
the vilest, most Shameful means in his hunt for people. 
Bearded Bill, exhausted and emaciated, vent to a workers' meeting, 
held a poster bearing the words "National Unity," and joined the demonstra-

cerning.a strike. Friendly relations with workers had been arranged, 
their confidence was assured. Bearded Bill is an FBI agent. This story, 
told, in Look,, dhows Hoover's working methods. Provocation, espionage, 
shadowing. One of Hoover's assistants declared that secret FBI agents 
"are sent on missions into labor unions, educational institutions, 
industrial, commercial, and other organizations." The "other" includes 
everything from churches to night clubs and Boy Scout organizations.

is always the same. At best -- loss of a job. Often -- a long prison

Here is one of the cases of which the FBI has thousands on files 
report on it appeared in a Western European newspaper. John Lincoln, 
a scientist, naively believed in American "democracy." In the beginning 
oY 1949 he was drafted into the Army.. The chief of intelligencein_his 
unit suspected that Lincoln was a Communist, The investigation began. 
It turned out that the FBI ha information on Lincoln from the age of 12. 
The file contained many details of his conversations with teachers in 
his grade school and in high school. Teachers were asked about his views 
when he was 17, 15, and even 12 years old. Everything was interwoven 
and reported, rumours and gossip were summed up in a 7-page document. 
What "compromised" John Lincoln? 
A former landlord "had not recommended that he be entrusted with 
sedret work in the United States Army." 
One of the school teachers affirmed that Lincoln "had expressed 
radical ideas" at the age of 16. 
-I -A certain acquaintance had heard it said that Lincoln was a Communist 
during his student years. 
While serving in the Army, Lincoln had received a letter from a 
_ 
labor-Union worker which contained the latest labor-union news. 
Acertain informer reported that the "subject of investigation is 
, _ 
a great supporter of Franklin D, Roosevelt, 
The subject, It turned out, was filled with "reckless ideas" on 
culture and, in the words of the informer, read poetry, 
Apparently, this latter "offense" of Lincoln taxed the patience of 
- 
the powers that be. He was declared %nivel." 
The. trial of Lincoln was typical. A dossier like the one that ruined 
,Lincoln, a dossier where efficiency is replaced with stupidity, follows 
a man even, when he leaves the territory of the United States. An example 
is the Ward case. 
Herbert and Jacqueline Ward are artists. A musician and a ballerina. 
RBI maintained careful shadowing of the artists. Then they took part in 
Ythe World Youth Festival, In 1953 the Wards traveled to Vienna. "Then

American. Spinks, the vice-consul in Vienna later told me. As soon as

tion, which is now the chief feature of the American public life." These 
are the wordsef Aerbert Ward. He uttered them after requesting political 
asylum from the Czechoslovak government. 
Edgar Hoover is trying to place Americans in a state of ceaseless 
fear. 
This fear is necessary to counteract any opposition to American 
aggressive policy. No one can feel secure and no one can deceive 
? 
"omnipresent" Hoover and his agents -- this is the leit motiv of all 
advertisements of the FBI in the press. Hoover and the bourgeois press 
are tirelessly pouring oil on the flame. On the pages of Pathfinder be 
wrote about perfected means of photography with secret cameras. "The 
subject does not know that he is being photographed. Pictures can be 
made day and night." An article in Look explained how FBI agents can 
overhear any telephone conversation. In This Week, Magazine Hoover 
extolled the cunning and resourcefulness of FBI agents. And in United. 
States News and Werld Report, reviewing the results of his work, he 
boasted, "The sixty-first Communist leader has been brought to justice 
and condemned to aperiod of 261 years and payment of court fines of 
$361,000L "More than 200 progressive organizations have been declared

' 
In his efforts to secure more informers and spies, Hoover has even 
appealed to draggists. An article appeared in the apothecary magazine, 
. _ _ 
Drug Topics. The chief of the FBI wrote, "There are few people, un-
doubtedly, who know the life of their area as well as American druggists. 
Their drugstores ,and dope are the center of all public life of their area. 
They are located in a conveniently strategic position for discovering... 
traitors and can render valuable service in catching and exposing them." 
The newspaper Peoples World ironically beer-fed that the following prescrip-
tion will be sent to druggists: "Eavesdrop and report four times a day ... 
Doctor J. Edgar Hoover." 
The FBI is one of the chief weapons in the straggle against progres-
sive forces in the United States, against the Communist Party. Informers, 
spies, and provecators of the FBI serve as witnesses for the Preeeantion 
in anti-Communist trials, On the basis of false testimony, leaders and.

When an FBI agent and Matusow, a provocator, confessed to giving 
false testimony, the whole unsightly kitchen of the Federal Bureau ,of 
Investigation and other organs of American justice was uncovered. Soon 
after MatUsow, another professional sleuth, a certain Browns who had 
been receiving about $200 a month from Hoover, publicly confessed. 
Elizabeth Bentley, the "'queen of spies," was unmaaked. These failures 
did. not disturb Hoover. After Congress passed a law banning the activities 
of the Communist Party, he again urged the "denunciation of the leaders 
and members of the Communist Party." Denounce, denounce, denounce.., the

Matusow's admission threw great light on the vile activities of 
Hoover's department, which fulfills the will of American magnates of "

the penetration of American Political police into different organs of the

During the 1952 pre-election campaign, when Matiasow travelled through 
the states giving speeches in: favor of McCarthy and. his supporters, he 
ran. into FEI, agents all along the way Who bossed different organs of the 
Republican Party. In particularo'the committee whichdirected the eam-
paign for the re7election'Of Senator Beton of Montana to the United 
States Senate was headed by a Certain J. K. MerrOi a "former" Fla agent. 
Several FBI agents handled the notorious Senate subcommittee on 
investigations which was headed by. McCarthy: a certain Don Conners --
?"the investigator of the subcommittee,"and Donald Su:rine, "a former 
agent." To this category also belong MeCarthi's other assistants --
Hawkins and:Julian. Through these representatives the American okhranka 
undertook different"investigations" and palmed off their spies and 
provocative "materials" -- forged documents -- on the subcommittee. 
, 
McCarthy'S reputation was almost hopelessly tainted., and reaction 
for several years prior to his death did not find it necessary to resort 
to his services. Another "witch hunter," Senator Eastland, advanced to 
the forefront. -ge headed a subcommittee on questions Of internal security 
and also held the important poet of chairman of the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee, According to. an acknowledgement by Time. Eastland "belongs to 
thoseijeopla4ho, above all, are hated in the United States." He enjoys 
:the well-deserved reputation of an inveterate reactionary and racialist. 
Eastland is a yelLito.46, Southern planter and tries in every Possible 
way to maintain the status of the :Negro, who is deprived of civil rights. 
When the United States Supreme Court decreed that Negroes cannot be 
deprived of the right to vote, Eastland deelared that Communists operate 
the court from behind, the scenes. Throughout the war, he came out with 
such revelations as "The Negro soldiers does not want to fight," "He 
betrayed. his country's flag," "He does not want to work." The minutes 
of the Senate are, stained with the countless, racialist pronouncements 
Of Eastland, who heads the Moat reactionary'wing of the Democratic Party --
the so-Called Diliecrats. He violently protested the United States 
Supreme Court's ruling on. desegregation in state schools. Using Hoover's 
'bloodhounds, Eastland followed the well-trodden path of provocations and 
different "investigations." 
In the spring of 1956 Edgar Hoover mulled over the days of his youth 
and the days of his collaboration with Palmer. In a truly Palmer spirit, 
FBI agents performed a series of raids on Communist Party offices and on 
the newspaper, Daily Worker. At the same time a trial of seven ComninTasts 
was proceeding in New York at which John Lwatner, Matusowle associate and 
a professional informer, like a schoolboy, repeated a lesson which be 
learned by heart at Edgar Hoover's establishment. 
The new wave of anti-Communist hysteria which surged throughout the 
United States was, as American observers justly noted, "like the ease of 
the burning of the Reichstag, only without the burning". It evoked. changes

The members of this committee were closely connected with Hitler's , 
underground in the United States.' It is clear why the Unmasking Of 
nntirouS-Naal agents operating 123:the United States was never effected 
by the '1131. 
The American press and. Hoover himself now advertise the FBI's role 
In the var. But a, fair evaluation of this role was made in Lowenthal's 
book mentioned above. He called these activities "comical" and showed 
that all cases of spy expods, *doh had been attributed to the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation, must be attributed to others as well. Two 
Nazis Who landed from a submarine were caught, not by an. FBI agent, but 
by a sevonteen=year-old boY. Lowenthal paid for his words of truth. His 
book was quickly Withdrawn from sale. 
There was no time for Hoover to contend with criminals and gangsters. 
According to information from the FBI itself, a serious crime Was COmmitted 
every 14.9 seconds in the United States in 1954. In 1956 a record'inmber 
of serious crimes -- 2,534,000 12 percent more, than in 1955 were com-
mitted. Hoover and the FBI have been continUausly engaged in creating 
a situation of terror in the Country, spreading the "philosophy of fear," 
and suppressing progressive activity. 
Has this work been successful? Listen to Edgar Hoover himsel(. 
This cheerful man, as the magazine Eye and Ear calls him, has suddenly 
become a pessimist. In American Magazine, in an article entitled 
"Communists Are Trying to Master Our Minds," Hoover was forced to admit 
that in spite of terror, shadowing, and persecution, the Influence of the 
Communist Party of the United States is "much greater" than one might 
suspect. Hoover cannot but admit the popularity of the ideas of peace 
and democracy for which the Communist Party sturggles; he cannot but 
admit that the Communists exert influence on the workers2 movement. It 
Is with good reason the work of Edgar Hoover and his colleague, the 
A. F. Stone Weeeklv, is called an "act of despair." He wrote that "It 
appears that we are on the verge of terror, organized by frightened 
people who feel that power is slipping out of their hands." 
For this very reason Hoover shouts about fictitious dangers which 
threaten to ruin America. 
What are these "dangers" from his point of view? Hoover answered 
this question on the pages of United States News and World Report. The 
dangers, it seems, are that: 1) American Communists have demanded peace-
ful settlement of the Korean military conflict; 2) they have appealed 
for the recall of American troops from foreign countries; 3) they want 
a pact of five great states, including People's China; 4) they want to 
trade with countries of the camp of democracy and socialism. It is in 
these things that Hoover sees danger for America -- in the reasonable

and legal demands of sensible Americans who are fed, up with the policy

In a suburb of Paris between Versailles and Saint-Germaine stands a 
small town of brick buildings of the barracks type, differing in no way 
from dozens of other American military centers. Here the headquarters of 
the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Armed 
Forces in Europe are located. Disciplined military police in white 
gloves guard the entrances and exits. In front of the main entrance, on 
high poles, are the flags of the NATO member countries. Formally the 
headquarters employees call themselves "international soldiers." In 
fact, American generals are completely in charge here. 
A correspondent of the West German newspaper, Die Welt, after 
visiting the NATO headquarters, stated, "I heard the7WCTR-Tblitzkrieg' 
('lightning war' LV,) in all the corners of these long barracks." 
A treaty, called the North Atlantic Treaty, was signed in 'Washington 
in 1949 by the representatives of 12 countries: the USA, Great Britain, 
France, Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Luxembourg, Iceland, 
Italy, Norway and Portugal. In 1952 Greece and Turkey joined it, and in 
1955,,West Germany. The new-born infant was diligently wrapped in 
swaddling clothes woven from lies about defense. The basic principles 
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (abbreviated in English to 
NATO) were formulated in a verbose declaration of the US State Department 
of 14 January 1949 with the hypocritical title, "Building the Peace. 
Collective Security in the North Atlantic Area." 
However, the aggressive nature of NATO was clear from the very first 
moment of this organization's appearance. And even earlier. A Declara-
tion of the USSR Ministry of Foreign Affairs of 29 January 1949 on the 
North Atlantic Treaty and a Memorandum of the Government of the Soviet 
Union of 31 March 1949 clearly demonstrated that the North Atlantic 
Treaty was an aggressive, closed, military grouping directed against the 
Soviet Government and the people's democracies. 
Yes, and in the USA and England themselves, the birthplace of NATO, 
there was no lack of frank acknowledgements. Some of them were made 
with malicious, misanthropic joy, and others with unfeigned alarm. "This 
treaty," wrote the Wall Street Journals "is a triumph, on a world-wide 
scale, of the law of the jungle over international cooperation". In the 
same spirit the Chicago newspaper, Lally News, stated, "A military union 
of the North Atlantic Treaty type is not, despite optimistic affirmations, 
a step in the direction of peace. It is a preparation for war." 
Nor was the target of the brigandish surprise attack a secret to 
anyone. The Gazette and Daily wrote quite justly: "We are responsible 
for the organization of this coalition against the Russians. If it leads 
to war the whole world will know whose the fault is."

The grim inventiveness of the designers of NATO extended so far that 
they were already concerning themselves over a pretext for a third world 
war. Article Six of the North Atlantic Treaty provides that any incident 
involving a vessel or aircraft in the vast territory of the Atlantic 
region between the North Pole and the Tropic of Cancer can serve as a 
cause for puttirg it into effect. In other words, as soon as the masters 
of the At?.antic Union consider that everything is ready, they can easily 
concoct the required trivial incident. 
NATO is .a gigantic Anglo-American octopus whose tentacles have 
wound around the territories and economies of the other member countries. 
Its military expenses are a heavy burden on the ordinary taxpayer. Gen-
eral Gruenther, former Supreme Commander European Armed Forces, announced 
in the spring of 1955 that when NATO was created the countries belonging 
to it were spending 5 billion dollars a year for military purposes, but 
in 1955 their expenditures had grown to 16 billion dollars. Gruenther 
spoke of this undisguised robbery of the workers as of a remarkable event 
of which one could and should be proud. 
The imperialists tried to distribute the roles in NATO as it suited 
them beforehand* Once in 1951 the then US Secretary of Defense, George 
Marsha11, carelessly admitted: "Our contribution is dollars rather than 
soldiers, The other parties (the countries of Western Europe) are con-
cerned with soldiers." However, even this most cynical declaration did 
not fully reveal the assignment of the roles in the North Atlantic Union. 
Not only does the US require cannon fodder from the other countries, but, 
as we saw above, they are also mercilessly squeezing money from them. 
The,United States has reserved the role of super slave driver for itself. 
Thisisconfirmed if only by the fact that until now only Americans 
have been supreme commanders of the NATO Armed Forces in Europe (abbre-
viated in English to SACEUR). The first SACEUR was General Eisenhower, 
the second, General Ridgway. Until 31 December 1956, the NATO headquar-
ters was directed by SACEUR III, General Alfred Gruenther. They are 
all representatives of the US military machine. 
.BACEUR,Ilas a not inconsiderable household. The armed forces com-
mand in gent/11 Europe, the commands in Northern and Southern Europe, and 
the, Mediterranean command are subordinate to him. 
The British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Selwyn Lloyd, 
speaking at a meeting held at the end of October 1956 in eulogy of 
Gruenther, was carried away and made one quite remarkable admission. 
All the NATO countries, he said, "have agreed that they will not move 
their armed forces about in General Gruentheris zone of command without 
his permission." Could it be possible to confirm more eloquently the 
sharneful fact that the decisive sovereign powers of the Western European 
countries have been given to the American general!

These are some brief facts on the aggressive grouping created by the 
USA in Edrope and headed by SACEUR III, Alfred Gruenther. 
xxx 
Gruenther was born in 1899. His father was the editor of a newspaper 
in the remote town of Platte Center (Nebraska). We do not have any data 
on the childhood and youth of the future SACEUR III worthy of the reader's 
attention. There is worth mentioning only an insolent escapade of the 
twenty-year old Alfred, who, in his,parent's absence, inserted an article 
of his own composition directed against the US Congress, in his father's 
newspaper. The young Gruenther fulminated against the high legislative 
assembly because of the millions spent for military needs and (irony of 
fate:), and argued that it mould be better to use this money for libraries 
and the needs of society. After almost 40 years, General Alfred 
Gruenther? without hesitating, mould strip the insignia from any of his 
subordinates who dared to utter such a thought. 
However, the sportive son rather quickly atoned for his fault 
against his father. He entered a military life. Graduating in November 
1918 from the Military Academy at West Point, he climbed the steps of a 
military career quite slowly. Only 17 years after leaving West Point did 
he reach the rank of captain, and in 1940 received a major's insignia. 
Probably Gruenther would have continued to climb the ladder of ranks at 
a snail's pace if Eisenhower, who, during maneuvers in Louisiana, took a 
fancy to the thin, wiry man of medium height with a loud voice like the 
horn of Jericho, had not taken him in tow. 
From the very first steps of his military career, Gruenther distin-
guished himself as an armchair warrior. An armchair and desk attracted 
him more than a saddle or a battery commander's telescope at a command 
point. As the West German journal, Der Spiegel, points out, Gruenther's 
record stated that he "excelled in theory, but could not stay in the 
saddle of even a child's wooden horse." During World War II Gruenther 
served as Chief, of Staff under Eisenhower and Clark. He always was "in 
the background", i.e., he was always substituting tor someone or assist-
ing somebody. "Gruenther," states the well-informed magazine, United 
States News and World Reports, never commanded in battle and continually 
had to do, "inferior, dirty military work." 
Thus the post of SACEUR, head of the NATO forces in Europe, is the 
first more or less independent post that Gruenther has had. It is not 
impossible that one of the reasons for appointing Gruenther to this 
position was his ability to keep refractory European allies in check. 
Gruenther acquired valuable experience of this sort at the end of the 
war when he was Chief of Staff of the 15th Army Group, where, according 
to his official biographers, he "came face to face with the problem of 
adOting a staff consisting mainly of Englishmen to the requirements 
a American command." Gruenther successfully adapted the Englishmen 
to the above-mentioned requirements despite an Anglophobia engrained in

him.sincehis youth. Gruenther himself, in a rare moment of revelation, 
declared that until. the age of 16 he did not even suspect that the 
expression "damned Englishmen" was not one mord. 
As far as the purely military aspects are concerned, no matter 
where you look in, Gruenther's service record, there is nothing special 
to praise the general for. 
Blafthat,in Whi..gh he was a genuine genius, that which he knew best 
of all sciences, was the "science" of playing bridge. The general's 
exploits on the green card table are impressive and unquestioned. It is 
even difficu4 to say Whether Gruenther thinks in military matters as a 
-gambler or operates like a military strategist at the card table. Having 
learned the secrets ,obridge in 1920 while training at the Fort Knox 
Field Artillery School, he afterwards won the title of best American 
judge of bridge games and earned quite a bit as a judge (100 dollars a 
night). He made an invaluable contribution to the treasure-house of the 
science of bridge by publishing two thick studies on this game. "These 
treatises," wrote The New Yorker "are still regarded as the most valuable 
wprk in this field." 
Thus, apart from bridge, we apparently have a mediocre man, an Army 
hack not noted by the press as having great gifts. But such a conclu-
sion would be too hasty and therefore erroneous. Gruenther's activity 
during thepost-war years showed with indisputable clarity that this 
general's spiritual mechanism lacks one part which, strictly speaking, 
gives a man the right to call himself a man: that is, humanity. Short, 
undersized AgrEd. Gruenther, in spite of so much unobtrusive external 
data, quite justifiably can be considered one of the worst enemies of 
millions -of peaceful workers, 
below we will try to prove this. 
* * * 
Gruent4er's activity is like an iceberg - one-seventh on the surface 
and, stx-seveOhs hidden from the observer's eye. But even Gruenther's 
public statements clearly show that he is a convinced supporter of 
atomic' warfare and an admirer of mass annihilation weapons. It is true 
that he, in advocating the use of atomic weapons, like Nozdrev[dxuaateT

ablressgs. Rqwever, the veil of "defense" talk in no way conceals the 
aggressive intent of Gruenther's appeals especially since the general 
lets the truth slip out at every step. 
_ 
0011ated, his statements on the question of atomic weapons make a 
rather gloomy collection. "We envisage the possibility of using atomic 
bombe against objectives in enemy territory," he declares without beating 
about the bush. Gruenther does not conceal that he intends the young

girl at a rendezvous, the old bee-keeper, and the mother sitting at the 
cradle to be targets for atomic attack. "Nuclear weapons must be directed 
against military objectives. Towever, it must not be forgotten that in 
many cases the civilian population might also suffer from this," spoke the 
general who supports atomic warfare, in the British House of Commons in 
Westminster, that very Westminster which was turned into a pile of stones 
during World War II. In an atomic excitement, Gruenther prefers not to 
think about the fate of the thickly populated British Isles if he unleashes 
atomic war. 
Gruenther has raised Hitler's scale to an atomic level in accordance 
with which 100 and then even more, peaceful Soviet citizens were to be 
wiped out for each Fascist soldier killed. Speaking before a group of 
British manufacturers, he announced that for each city destroyed in the 
West "we could destroy 6 such cities in the USSR." On this occasion the 
English newspaper, The Daily Worker, indignantly wrote: "Even Hitler, 
in his worst moments of folly, did not dare to threaten a state with which 
Germany was at peace in the terms that Gruenther threatened the Soviet 
Union." 
But the men wishing to excel Hitler's record should be reminded how 
the raging Fuehrer adventure ended. It is amazing, but a fact - the 
supporters of atomic warfare sometimes forget that it is the same dis-
tancefrom us to their bases as from their bases to us. And it is more 
than rash to forget this! 
In September 1953 Gruenther's staff, according to information 
leaking into the American press, had already formulated a detailed plan 
for atomic armament in Europe, and in December 1954 Gruenther thought 
he had finally untied the hands of the supporters of atomic warfare: a 
session of the NATO Council legalized atomic warfare. This criminal 
decision cloaked by an envelope of apparently innocent words, is con-
tained in Paragraph 6 of the communique of the Paris session of the 
Council which ended on 18 December 1254. Here is how this remarkable 
Paragraph 6 reads: "The Council examined a report presented by the 
Military Committee on the question of a more effective system of organiz-
ing NATO's military defensive power during the next few years in consid-
eration of modern achievements in the development of arms and methods 
(speaking of thermonuclear weapons - M. V.). It approved this report as 
the basis for the planning of the defense and preparations being imple-
mented by the military organs of NATO...". The Belgian Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Speak, translating Paragraph 6 from a.deliberately ob-
scure language into ordinary speech, declared that these decisions give 
"the military exactly what they need. They demanded permission to pre-
pare for atomic war. This permission was given to them."

Ekactly a year later, in December 19551 the policy of using atomic 
and hydrogen arms as the basic type of armament for the troops of the 
Atlantic Bloc countries was officially proclaimed at a session of the 
NATO Council. 
The task which Gruenther was given when he was appointed to his post 
c-onsists of two interwoven parts: first, to prepare the NATO military 
machine for conducting atomic war, and second, to re-establish the West 
German Wehrmacht. Gruenther devoted himself fully to the achievement of 
these two goals. He expressed his chief strategic aim as a two-fold 
formula. Two things are necessary said Gruenther to the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee: "an effective contribution from Germany and the 
ability to use atomic weapons". He is indeed obsessed by the idea of 
real-mine-West-Germany. In everything Gruenther said and everywhere he 
spOke he invariably repeated the advantages of atomic warfare and of a 
new Wehmachtp A travelling salesman of death, he toured the European 
capital's plugging for the rearmament of West Germany. With threats and 
r.---s011es, promises and pleadings, Gruenther forded the Western European 
parliaments to ratify an agreement on the remilitarization of West , 
Germany and its inclusion in the Atlantic Union. Gruenther really "ham-
med it up" in front of Danish journalists at a press conference in 
Copenhagen in January1955. Clasping his hand to his heart, he said 
that he understood the reluctance of the Danish people, having undergone 
the occupation, to see West Germany armed again. More than that, he 
admitted that the same feelings were also noticeable in other countries. 
But what can be done; the general sighed and lifted his hands in dismays 
Germany's contribution to "the defense of Europe is necessary." 
According to Gruenther, the remilitarization of Germany is a step 
in the direction of unifying Europe . Without West Germany, he "explains" 
elsewhere, the NATO armed forces "do not have sufficient depth." 
Behind all this chatter, designed for credulous simpletons, a cold, 
cruel plan is concealed. No matter what Gruenther repeats at press con-
ferences and in parliaments, he needs the West German divisions as the 
basic shock force for aggression against the Soviet Union and the peo-
ples democracies. With the bones of West German youths, he wishes to 
pi:lie a road to the East for American tanks. 
" I r 
He does not feel right without the German divisions. Gruenther 
scornfully calls plans drawn up without counting on a Wehrmacht "unsatis-
factory, second-rate strategy .n On the other hand, the inclusion of 
Germany in -NATO will make it possible for him to conduct, as he expresses 
it, na first-class strategy." Despite Gruenther's wish to becloud the 
water, it is not especially difficult to guess that by "a first-class 
strategy" he has aggression in mind. His concern for the speedy rebirth 
of the Wehrmacht reached the point that (as the West German journal,

Approved For Release 2001/07/28 : CIA-RDP65-00756R000300270001-9 
Der Spiegel, wrote) he himself drew up a list of generals and field 
marshals from Hitler's army whom he would like to see 'in leading posts 
in the new Wehrmacht. 
While some may have done so, Gruenther never took seriously the 
paper "limitations" placed on the Wehrmacht by the Paris agreements. Even 
before the West European parliaments started to debate the question of the 
Paris agreements, Gruenther assured the Bonn generals, Hedsinger and 
Cruewell, that the new Wehrmacht would not consist of 12 divisions as the 
official propaganda proclaimed, but of 48. 
At one of the NATO sessions, when the Bonn representatives eagerly 
confirmed their agreement to play the role given them by Gruenther, the 
latter, according to his own statement, "wished to jump up and shout, 
'Hip hip, hurrah!'" 
On 9 May 1955, the 10th anniversary of V-E day, as if to jeer at the 
memory of the millions of victims of Fascism, Gruenther, his bosses, and 
his subordinates, received West Germany as a member of the North Atlantic 
Union. 
* * * 
It would seem as though Gruenther and his bosses in the Pentagon, 
Wall Street, Downing Street and the Cite have a reason to rejoice: their 
plans have almost been realized. They have the decisions of the Paris 
NATO session "legalizing" atomic warfare and the Paris agreements "legal-
izing" the rebirth of the Wehrmacht. Nevertheless, the general is in 
panic. To his horror, he discovered that he rejoiced too soon. 
Many months ago the American magazine, Colliers, farsightedly 
warned: "Gruenther's difficult mission will consist of convincing unen-
thusiastic governments of the need to complete their military prepara-
tion for a war in which no-one now believes and for which no one really 
wishes to prepare." Gruenther paid no attention to such warnings. In 
general, he paid attention to nothing except fulfilling the instructions 
given him: to prepare for atomic blitzkrieg and to forge a West German 
battering ram for new aggression. Such a limitation in point of view 
is perhaps permissible in bridge playing, but it is a fatal defect in 
politics. 
In the beginning, Gruenther tried to ignore the slow but steady 
process of enlightenment among the widest circles of the West European 
public. The unchanging and consistent peaceful foreign policy of the 
Soviet Union, the great peaceful deeds of the Soviet people, the unprec-
edented growth in the Soviet Union's industry and agriculture witnessed 
by dozens of different visiting bourgeois delegations, unmasked the 
myth concocted by American propaganda of the imaginary aggressiveness of 
the Soviet state. And then in Western Europe they began to understand

Approved For Release 2001/07/28 : CIA-RDP65-00756R000300270001-9 
the simple truth that the supporters of atomic warfare from over the ocean, 
,Gruenther and Co., chattering about the defense of Europe from communism, 
were actually hatching sinister plans to use it in achieving their merce-
nary motives. 
Fear is the ally of Gruenther and his bosses. This, in his opinion, 
is the cement which must glue together all the NATO member countries. And 
he encourages this fear in every way, ignoring the spirit of the times, 
the real facts. When, after the Geneva Conference of the four great 
powers, a certain lessening of international tension was noted, Gruenther 
hastened to affirm that this would not cause any changes in military prep-
arations. The Soviet Union's announcement of a reduction in the size of 
its armed forces at first plunged Gruenther into confusion. Seeing the 
unanimous approval this measure of the Soviet state received everywhere, 
he lost his head and said that he was "meeting this step with caution." 
However, a week later he found himself and blithely announced that "sig-
nificance should not be given to" this step. And finally, three weeks 
later, he solemnly said that a reduction in armed forces "could actually 
strengthen rather than weaken USSR military potential!" 
Thus, feeling that his main propaganda trump, the affirmation of the 
"aggressive designs" of the USSR, was knocked from his hand, the bridge 
champion drew a marked card from his sleeve without the slightest embar-
rassment. Gruenther experiences about the same thing as the cheat, 
Gorekhvastov, described by Saltykov-Shchedrin. "Once I was keeping bank," 
relates Gorekhvastov, "and was keeping it rather well as usual when sud-
denly one of the punters, a stranger about two feet high, seized Ry hands 
and squeezed them so hard that the bones cracked. 'You, sir, are a 
scoundrel,' he said to me.., land now I will prove it.' Well, he proved 
it... 'You, he said must now leave through this window." Gruenther was 
definitely afraid of the possibility of a similar ending. The general 
sounded the alarm. Speaking to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 
he anxiously reported: "Although atomic warfare is now an accepted part 
of NATO military doctrine, the communists are advancing rather effective 
propaganda in Europe against the use of atomic weapons. The Russian 
propaganda on peaceful coexistence is connected with this. The Russians 
are beating the US in the political war. Already a slight but clear 
tendency toward relaxation is noticeable. This is not alarming as yet, 
but can become alarming)' 
The ever increasing demand of the peoples to outlaw atomic and 
hydrogen weapons is throwing Gruenther into a panic. In his speech at 
the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York, he sounds a really hysterical 
note. "There is a quite serious danger," Gruenther said excitedly, 
"that public opinion will force the political leaders to make a dangerous 
compromise, which, in the final analysis, can turn out quite unfavorably 
for us." And pointing once again to the danger represented by "communist 
propaganda" against the atomic bomb, the general hysterically cried: "It 
would be madness to relinquish it" (i.e., the bomb).

Fearing the insight of the peoples, Gruenther, with "genuine sadnese, 
admitted that one of the main problems of NATO was to force the public to 
recognize that it was a "defensive" organization, and not an "offensive 
one. In other words, he was trying to convince the peoples that the North 
Atlantic Treaty was intended for maintaining peace. Vain attempts: 
This propaganda maneuver was unmasked in a report of the Central Com-
mittee of the CPSU at the 20th Party Congress... "The adherents of a 
'position of strength' policy," the report states, "are presenting the 
armaments race as a basic recipe .., for maintaining peace! It is quite 
apparent that if states compete in increasing military might, the threat 
of war grows rather than diminishes". 
The aggressive nature of the Atlantic Treaty, apparent from the first 
moments of its existence, are being revealed and confirmed daily and 
hourly. The following fact is one of the clearest indications. When the 
Soviet Union announced its desire to join NATO, the Western Powers refused. 
Thus they themselves exposed the insincerity of their announcements as to 
the alleged defensive character of NATO and showed the closed, aggressive 
character of this grouping, directed against the Soviet Union and the peo-
ple's democracies. 
Is it necessary to say that Gruenther began to exult when he learned 
of the bloody attack by Hungarian counterrevolutionaries, inspired by 
Western, mainly American, reaction. 
Gruenther labelled as "freedom fighters" the butchers and murderers 
who unleashed the white terror in the country, the torturers who hung by 
the feet and burned Hungarian patriots alive. What kind of freedom? His 
Gruentherite, capitalist freedom of the exploitation of man by man. 
The tragic Hungarian events delighted Gruenther even more because 
they in his opinion, slowed down and undermined the process of relaxation 
of international tension, a process so odious to Gruenther. 
In April 1956 SACEUR III announced that he was resigning from his 
NATO post to "make it possible to promote someone younger and to make way 
for new ideas." It was announced on the spot that Gruenther's successor 
would be Air Force General Norstad, again an American! Gruenther was re-
placed by Norstad on 31 December 1956. 
As to the future activities of Alfred Gruenther, after many guesses 
and assumptions, it was finally announced that he had been appointed 
President of the American Red Cross. There is no doubt that General 
Gruenther will spare no pains to turn the American Red Cross into his 
kind of branch of NATO.

Approved For Release 2001/07/28 : CIA-RDP65-00756R000300270001-9 
However, there are weighty reasons for supposing that Gruenther's 
retirement was in no way dictated entirely by his wish "to make way for 
new ideas." A quite sad event for the diplomat-general preceded his 
departure. He let out a secret. Speaking to a group of journalists at 
the beginning of April, he gave them to understand that in case of war 
the armies of the European NATO countries would be no more than pawns in 
the bloody atomic game, which the imperialist robbers were intending to 
maneuver, sacrificing the lives of hundreds of millions of people! 
Gruenther's revelation caused an unbelievable stir in the Western 
press. Official protests followed, and, a week later, the forthcoming 
retirement of the chattering SACEUR III was announced. But he did not 
quiet down. Up to the very last day he travelled about the European 
capitals on farewell visits, intimidating, entreating them "not to relax 
their efforts", and brandishing atomic weapons. 
Everyone waves farewell in his own way. True to himself, Gruenther 
did not forget in the end (13 November 1956) to threaten the Soviet Union 
with an atomic fist, covered, of course, in a glove colored with defense. 
He announced that in case of attack by the Soviet Union (?!) the US 
"would resort to retaliatory measures", and "would destroy" the USSR. 
Thus, during three and one half years of NATO rule, Gruenther kept his 
style, the style of a militant atomic braggart, up to the end. 
' It is characteristic that Gruenther gave his last long speech in 
Europe before his departure for the US in the Royal Festival Hall in 
London at a conference of the Federation of British Industries. Hardly 
had he arrived in the US when he spoke, where but at the convention of 
the National Association of Manufacturers calling for a continuation of 
the "position of strength" policy. Tell me who your friends are and I 
will tell you who you are. However, in this case it would be more cor-
rect to speak of Gruenther's bosses, not of his friends... 
The lessening of international tension "is a fact to cause anxiety," 
and the outlawing of atomic weapons is "madness." Such is Gruenther's 
"creed." And although this distorted philosophy is deeply alien to the 
peoples, nevertheless statesmen at the helm of some Western countries 
considered it possible to decorate the general who supports atomic war-
fare upon his departure. President Heuss of the Federal Republic of 
Germany gave Gruenther the "Great Cross for Services"; the former 
French Premier Guy Mollet pinned the "Military Medal" to'his dress coat. 
They wished in this way to convince the public of Gruenther's "eminence." 
But all the activity of SACEUR III inexorably shows that he belongs to 
those people of whom the eminent English satirist, Henry Fielding, said 
"their greatness consists of inflicting all sorts of evils upon mankind."

The Legion of American Reaction /kir. ChapIygin 
There is a sentimental legend about the birth of the American Legion, 
In 1918, according to this legend, when the last battles of World War 
I were dying away, two front-line fighters met in an American hospital in 
France. 
The history of the Legion colorfully describes the conversation be-
tween these front-line fighters - Lieutenant-Colonel Teddy Roosevelt, Jr. 
and Sergeant William Patterson. The obscure sergeant and the brilliant 
officer had a friendly conversation about what they intended to do after 
the war. Both were fascinated by the idea of creating an organization 
which would unite veterans. 
The Legion "chroniclers," recalling this "historic meeting" with 
tears of tender emotion, write: 
"They (Roosevelt and Patterson) agreed that they wanted to return 
to their units as quickly as possible, tet the whole job over with,' and 
then to home and establish a veterans' association for the good of the 
country'." Patterson was later killed in action. 
Poor Patterson thus did not even succeed in "getting the whole job 
over with," i.e., the war, which was unnecessary and alien to his in-
terests. However, the legend of the brotherly ties of friendship which 
so idyllically connected the aristocratic officer and the obscure ser-
geant continued to live. It even was a success, and a far from acci-
dental success; in the US even legends are business. And a new mass 
organization, the American Legion, needed publicity (advertising) during 
the days of its birth. 
? Incidentally, this advertising was organized on such a "grand 
scale", that not even the most naive person could believe that it was 
paid for by Sergeant Patterson, living on a soldier's rations, or even 
the well-heeled officer, Roosevelt. Poor Patterson already lay in his 
grave, having died for the sake of profits for the fantastically rich 
monopolies and concerns. And thousands of journals, pamphlets and 
prospectuses shouted about the beauty of his idea of creating a legion 
of veterans, an organization in which there would be no ranks, in which 
millionaire and street-cleaner would be equal. 
No, it was not the dead Patterson's legacy, consisting of a mess 
kit and a spoon, which became the basic capital for establishing the 
Legion. 
From where did this by no means small capital come, then?

, The American newspaperman, Justin Gray, did considerable work to 
ansiqer this question. The task he set himself was not easy; the Legion's 
financial matters are kept strictly secret. They were veiled with new 
legends. 1111921 the Legion published a "Dictionary of Facts." This 
stated that 400 American citizens from 13 states raised $257,000 and 
presented it "for nourishment" to the forming Legion. In 1923 a Legion 
historian, James, apparently forgetting the first legend, gave another 
version. He affirmed that "213 Legionnaires" paid this money. In 1946 
yet another historian, Jones, without any embarrassment stated that 
$305,255 was collected for establishing the Legion and that only 93 per-
sons Contributed this sizeable sum. 
The further we go into historical research on the establishment of 
the Legion, the more we understand why the creators of the sweet, senti-
mental legends have entangled themselves. 
Justin Gray energetically undertook to eliminate the uncharted 
areas in the history of the Legion. And he discovered that the version 
of the touching meeting of the military friends being treated for their 
wolinde in an American hospital in France, and thinking up the "happy 
idea" of creating a mass veterans' organization, was a cheap invention. 
The facts easily refute it. 
,"Three ,years before Teddy Roosevelt was discussing the creation 
of an American Legion with his friend, Sergeant Patterson," writes 
Justin Gray in his book, "and four years before he 'introduced' his 
plan to fellow officers at dinner in Paris, he was already on record as 
one of the incorporators and directors of an organization called the 
American Legion." 
Three Years after this organization was established, they decided 
to arrange its second birth. The name of the obscure Sergeant Patterson 
was needed to put new "color" into the history of the veterans' organi-
zation, to make this history more appealing for millions of GIs (CI is 
a nickname for the American soldier widely used in the US) who were 
about to exchange their rifles for the tools of peaceful labor. 
Th P facts which so decisively debunk the primitive, sentimental 
, 
legend show exactly who the friends were who supported Lieutenant-
Colonel Teddy Roosevelt, Jr. The people making up the "big twenty" 
who created the Legion in 1919 were as remote from the obscure Sergeant 
Patterson as heaven is from earth. Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., himself 
was vice-president of Doubleday, Doran Publishers and director of the 
American, apress Company, which was affiliated with the Rockefeller 
interests through the Chase National Bank. And here, as an example, 
is some brief information on five of Teddy's friends who joined him in 
recreating the Legion.

S. 
Franklin D'Olier, the First National Commander of the Legion, was 
president and director of the Prudential Life Insurance Company, connected 
with the Morgan group, director of the Rockefeller Chase National 'lank, 
director of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, the National Biscuit 
Company, the American Bank Company, etc. 
David Marvin Goodrich was chairman of the board of the B. F. Goodrich 
Company, one of the largest concerns in the US rubber industry. 
BaLacy Kountz was chairman of the board of the DeVoe and Reynolds 
Company, director of the Metropolitan Opera and of the Real Estate 
Company. 
Edward Buxton was chairman of the board of the Five Textile Mills 
and director of the Theodore Foster and Brothers Textile Company. 
Francis Appleton was director of the Waltham Watch Company, the 
Mount Morris Bank, and the National Park Bank, and co-owner of the firm 
of Appleton, Rice and Perrin. 
The other members of the "twenty" who organized the Legion were also 
at home in the salons of capitalist magnates. It is characteristic that 
even the heads of the Legion were, from year to year, capitalist big 
shots, Wall Street manufacturers and bankers: Abel Davis, John Henry 
Sherbourne, Henry Fairfield Osborne, Jr,? Devereaux Milburn, Lawrence 
Harly Whiting, etc. 
The capitalist monopolies caused the Legion to be born. They paid 
for it. It faithfully serves their interests. 
The aims and tasks of the American Legion were already determined 
three years before the legendary "meeting in the hospital." These tasks 
were determined, of course, not by such simple fellows as Sergeant 
Patterson, but by the brilliant big-business friends of Theodore 
Roosevelt, Jr. And these tasks did not consist at all of putting an end 
to such a thing as war; on the contrary, they were directed toward pre-
paring millions of simple Americans for war. 
The first National Commander of the American Legion, Franklin 
DrOlier, frankly defined another basic taskibf the Legion. In an article 
printed in the American Legion Monthly, capitalist D'Olier announced 
without beating about the bush that the Legion must prevent the develop-
ment of progressive, democratic ideas, and the growth of the workers' 
movement in the US. 
"Let us remember the situation after the Armistice (World War I - 
Yu Ch.)," wrote D'Olier. "The nerves of the whole world were on edge. 
Fear of Bolshevism ruled. The social revolution in Russia was accom-
plished by dissatisfied soldiers, and there are a great many soldiers in 
the world occupied only with thoughts of their troubles."

To block-the stream of history, to force it to go backwards or at 
least to, stop - that was the idea controlling the minds of the frightened 
morlopoly bosses, before whose eyes blazed the glow of the Great October 
Socialist Revolution. And the friends of Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. did 
not spare funds for this job, for the job of struggling against life, 
progress, and the people who wish to be free of their adversities. The 
monopoly big shots called on each other to loosen their purse strings, 
to show kingly generosity to their donations to the Legion. Here is a 
typical letter from a representative of one of the largest meat-canning 
firms in the US to a Chicago meat seller: 
"NS are all interested in the Legion," said the letter, "and in the 
results it will have in realizing its ultimate aim - the suppression of 
radicalism. 
"It is extremely important that we help this worthy activity. The 
chairman of the meeting, has proposed that I approach various stockyard 
interests for contributionS." 
The "worthy activity" of the American Legion was wholly directed 
toward rousing war hysteria in the US, preparing the country for a new 
-military adventure of the imperialists, cruelly suppressing the progres-
sive movement, and mercilessly putting down of any attempt by the workers 
to defend their rights and achievements. 
While hired historians, inspired by donations from the monopolists, 
are creating banal, sentimental legends of the brotherly friendship be-
tween the capitalist officer and the poor sergeant, life is creating 
, 
another, truthful, genuine chronicle of the American Legion. 
And this chronicle shows that the Legion is used by its Wall 
Street bosses as a heald of new wars and as a true stronghold of 
Imperialists. 
There is no slander against the Soviet Union too vile and unscrupu-
lous for the American Legion to take part in. Encouragement of anti-
Soviet hysteria, appeals for more and more wars against the USSR and the 
people's democracies, and demands for a furious armaments race are heard 
at all the Legion conventions.

Here is the bare chronicle. 
195? 
The National Convention of the American Legion adopts a recommenda-
tion demanding that the Korean war be expanded; that US mastery in the 
Far East and Southeast Asia be strengthened; and that war be started 
with China.

The Legion's Convention supports the demands of the secretaries of 
Argy and Navy, who are urging increases in military appropriations. 
1953 
The National Convention of the American Legion approves a resolution 
demanding total war against the countries of the socialist camp and the 
use of atomic weapons in this war. 
The Convention opposes the entry of People's China into the UN. 
1954 
The National Convention of the American Legion passes a resolution 
which states that the Legion is dissatisfied with the peaceful settle-
ment of the war in Indo-China. 
The Convention opposes negotiations to relax international rela-
tions and demands a policy of "concentrated retaliatory blows." The 
Convention also demands a most speedy establishment of a military bloc 
in Southeast Asia and the rearmament of West Germany as part of the 
armed forces of the North Atlantic Union. It further advised breaking 
with the USSR and the people's democracies. 
The Convention approves the government's program of creating 137 
air regiments by 1957 and supports the proposal to introduce universal 
military conscription in the US. 
1955 
The Convention of the Legion censures the US government for aid to 
India, since India maintains friendly relations with the USSR. In a 
desire to frustrate peace, its resolution called on the US to withdraw 
from the Nilitary'Armistice ComMissinn in Korea. 
The National xecutive Committee of the American Legion passed a 
resolution demanding that the US continue to occupy the whole of Formosa 
(Taiwan). 
1956 
Alarmed by the collapse of the "position of strength" policy and 
the relaxation of international tension, the Legion's top echelon 
makes desperate attempts to resume the "cold war." At the Legion Con-
vention there are speeches eulogizing the policy of strength, and harsh 
threats are heard against all progressive people in the US who desire 
peace and strive toward normalization of relations with the USSR.

There are not the slightest doubts about the political sympathies of 
the Legion's top echelon. They are always with those who are preparing 
for war. They are mortal enemies of those who fight for peace. In 1933 
the heads of the Legion awarded the title of Honorary Legionnaire to 
Benito Mussolini. .American reactionary circles more than once planned a 
Fascist revolution in the US with the assistance of the Legion. Its 
bosses never stop for a minute the frantic propaganda, full of furious 
anger, against the Soviet Union. 
Even in 1919 those who formed the Legion were worried about the mood 
of the rank-and-file soldiers, who thought about the needs of the people 
and clearly did not wish military adventures. It was not easy to keep 
the deceived Pattersons obedient or to educate them to be professional 
killers. 
But the leaders of the Legion dealt not only with some recalcitrant 
veterans. The Legion became the watchdog of reaction. 
How the Legion is used to suppress the constitutional rights of 
American citizens and how it puts down the workers in the US who are 
struggling for their vital rights, has long been known from the boastful 
stories in the American bourgeois press. In October 1935 the reactionary 
Time magazine wrote that the slaughter in Centralia, Washington, made the 
American Legion famous as the most potent strike-breaking organization in 
the country." 
In Centralia the legionnaires butchered the lumber workers organized 
in a labor union. Many workers were killed and mutilated during this un-
bridled pogrom. Since then the sorry fame of the Legion as the most 
powerful strikebreaker in the US has spread. Those who enter the Legion 
are forced to pass a peculiar examination in strike-breaking. Here, for 
example, are the questions which the heads of one of the New York Legion 
posts give the new initiate: 
"Would you go on strike if the union told you to? 
"Would you carry out the Legion's order if it ordered you to break 
this strike? 
"If the Legion, through its officials, ordered you to break a strike 
in some other industry than your own, would you obey this order?" 
The role of strike breaker and policeman is not all that is required 
of the legionnaire. He must also be an agent of the police detective 
organization, the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation). 
The head of the FBI, Hoover, declared in a speech published in the 
Legion-distributed press:

"For many years the Legion, in close cooperation with the FBI, has 
struggled to maintain order in the country. With the coming of war, 
business-like relations between them became even closer and the results 
were even more favorable." 
After World War II the "business-like cooperation" between the secret 
police and the American Legion strengthened. As the New Republic magazine 
states, "Hoovers people" still play a conspicuous role in Legion leader-
ship. 
Justin Gray relates eloquently in his book, "The Inside Story of the 
Legion,? how Legion posts entangle whole cities in a spider web of inves-
tigation and informing. Everywhere the eyes and ears of the Legion fol-
low every step of the American citizen; they are ready, apparently, to 
take under special observation and examination even the dreams of a 
peaceful father of a family. 
"Informers," says Gray in his book, "can be both legionnaires and 
non-legionnaires. They can be an officer of the local post, the mayor of 
your city, or your nearest neighbor, a non-veteran with whom you chat 
each evening through your garden fence. He regularly reports to . 
Indianapolis (the city where the Legion staff is located) everything that 
you say, do or think." 
The power of the Legion over the fate of the ordinary American often 
becomes unlimited; in many US cities the Legion, in essence, controls all 
social and cultural life. In the US there are towns where the Legion 
holds all key positions. Without its assistance the demobilized soldier 
cannot find work. The politician who quarrels with the Legion post (the 
local organization) can say good-bye to his career forever. 
At one time truthful reports were printed in the American press 
about the cities of fear. One of these cities, Middletown, was described 
as a place where the whole population is benumbered; each step of the 
Middletown resident is controlled by reactionary zealots. A cruel pun-
ishment by the Black Hundred threatened the citizen who joins a'labor 
union. Dozens of sinister voices on the telephone frighten the person 
seen reading a progressive book or newspaper. And the organizer of all 
this torture by fear, to which the whole population of the city is ex-
posed, is the local American Legion post. 
The US ruling circles love to boast of their "objectivity?, their 
loyalty to freedom and democracy. Therefore, even when the remnants of 
democratic freedoms are violated through cruel laws, when reaction is 
disposing of them especially unceremoniously and brazenly, the so-called 
"social organizations" with a pro-Fascist slant of the American Legion 
type are called upon for help.

The workers and employees of a department store in the modest town 
of Galveston decided to join a labor union of office and sales personnel. 
One would think this was a quite innocent attempt, in permissible form, 
to defend the elementary and vital economic interests of the workers. 
But reaction gave the signal to deal with the progressive elements. The 
legislative organs of the state of Texas, making use of the "incident" 
of entry into the labor union of office and sales personnel, hurriedly 
worked out a bill prescribing the death sentence for every Communist 
found in the state. Under the guise of fighting against the danger of 
communism, it was decided to outlaw not only all progressives, but also 
those thinking only of defending the working rights of a citizen. An 
urgent investigation of communist activity in Texas was planned. No 
particular communist activity was noted in the state. How could it be 
fabricated? Here the masters of dirty business from the American Legion 
were called upon for help. Along with the legionnaires, professional 
false witnesses - the FBI provocateurs, especially the not unknown 
Harvey Matusow - also participated in concocting fantastic "crimes" of 
the communists. 
In his book, "False Witness," Matusow relates more than a little 
about the unsavory role which the American Legion plays in the country's 
political life. Where the government organs and the staffs of the two-
ruling American parties (Republican and Democratic) must maintain the 
appearance of not being implicated in disgusting political maneuvers, 
the American Legion comes to the rescue. When the hired false witness, 
Matusow, had to appear as an agitator for the most reactionary candidates 
of the Republican Party, a "solid reputation" was created for him. It 
was the American Legion that did this. The American Legion magazine 
printed a long article advertising Matusow before his tour of agitation. 
This made it possible for him to implicate in a Communist plot everyone 
who did not support these reactionary candidates of the Republican 
Party, including personnel of the New York Times, hundreds of teachers, 
etc. 
When the pillars of reaction need to get rid of unsuitable people, 
they mobilize the legionnaires. The blackest pages in contemporary 
American life are connected with the American Legion. The mass assault 
on the audience at a concert in Peekskill by the outstanding singer and 
peace fighter, Paul Robeson, was organized with the active participation 
of the American Legion. 
Those who awarded the title of honorary legionnaire to the first 
"prophet" of Fascism, Mussolini, would very much like to train, from 
among the legionnaires, youths like the Black Shirts, who participated 
in the march on Rome, or Hitler's Brown Shirts. And the money-bags, 
interested in keeping their Black Hundred, do not grudge the funds for 
this training. However, it would be the grossest error to believe that 
all members of the American Legion are Fascists and confirmed reaction-
aries, or hardened enemies of progress.

Many of the present-day legionnaires have shared the sad fate of 
their, predecessor, Sergeant Patterson, with whose name the "chroniclers" 
of the American Legion have speculated so unceremoniously. 
Hundreds of thousands of Pattersons have been caught in its net of 
deceit. The fact that the real master of the Legion is the staff of the 
American monopolies, the National Association of Manufactuers, has been 
carefully hidden from them and remains hidden. The facts revealing the 
true purpose of the Legion have been hidden from them and remain hidden. 
Of course, many of them who have been forced to do the dirty business 
of strike breaking, secret investigation for the FBI, and getting rid of 
honorable people, have been decoyed into a trap out of which it is not so 
simple to break. Justin Gray gives a typical statement of one of the 
ordinary legionnaires, a worker who is a plumber: 
"I do not like this business of beating up people, but if I don't 
take part in it I'd have to go out of business.?" 
The tragedy of the majority of legionnaires is the tragedy of peo-
ple drawn by deceit into proceedings hostile and foreign to them. The 
present-day Pattersons are beginning to understand that they have been 
deceived. However, the deafening propaganda, for which the monopoly big 
Shots grudge no funds, continues to influence these people, trying to 
convince them that the Legion is the most democratic organization in the 
world, and that the Legion is defending the veterans vital interests. 
The American press now speaks openly of how remote the leadership of the 
Legion is from its rank-and-file members. Not long ago an interesting 
article appeared in New Republic. It exposed the ever-growing sharp 
distinctions between the leaders of the American Legion and the mass of 
deceived and hoodwinked people who are its rank-and-file members. 
During the last seven years, this magazine affirms, the Legion has 
been controlled entirely by a very few people, directly affiliated with 
banks and monopolies. Each year in May important people, bigwigs from 
the largest monopolies and other powers-that-be, gather to name the new 
national commander who must officially be elected in September at the 
Legion Convention. 
All the decisions and recommendations adopted at these conventions 
are worked out by these leaders, who do not even bother to ask the 
opinion of those Pattersons in whose names these decisions are adopted. 
The warlike cliches and appeals for new military provocations that re-
sound every fall from the convention hall have nothing in common with 
the opinion of the majority of the legionnaires.

The internal procedures of the Legion symbolize, as it were,, that 
-outrage against democracy which the bosses of the monopolies openly allow 
themselves, while strenuously advertising benefits for the so-called 
"free world". 
The propagandists paid by the monopolies affirm that all of the 
meMbers of the American Legion are equal and that there is no difference 
in ranks here, no distinction between rich and poor. 
In practice everything appears otherwise. One of the commanders of 
the American Legion, Griffith, speaking before big businessmen, quite 
frankly spoke of the nature of that "democracy" which is cultivated in 
the Legion. 
"Ilan," declared Griffith, "is a donkey, and to make him move, it is 
necessary to lure him from ahead with a carrot or to urge him from behind 
with a stick. The carrot is an incentive. The stick is a means of com-
pulsion. In America we always use the carrot." 
There are many caSes Showing that the attempts of the legionnaires 
to defend their rights have been blocked decisively and cruelly by Legion 
leaders. 
The story of the Duncan-Paris Post (local organization) is an example 
f this. 
This post, concerned over a serious housing shortage for veterans, 
decided to take the initiative. It began a campaign for mass housing con-
struction for veterans in New York. Forty-three posts supported the 
Duncan-Paris Post. The former front-line fighters decided to show the 
public all the misery of their situation. The post negotiated with the 
owners of the Ludwig Baumann department store to have one of the legion-
naires with his whole family, goods and chattels, settle in one of this 
store's windows. Two other families found a night's lodgings on the stage 
of one of the Broadway theaters. 
The Duncan-Paris Post devoted all its effort to support of the 
Nyatt-Patman bill providing an extensive veterans' housing program. 
The Legion heads made it appear that they were supporting the bill, 
"this carrot" for the legionnaires. But then the time came to fight for 
passage of this bill in Congress. The heads of the Legion did everything 
to make it fail. 
This business was not finished. The Legion post which had been bold 
enough to show initiative and fight energetically for veterans' rights 
was suspended by an order from above. The Legion's National Executive 
Committee simply crossed this post off its lists.

This episode, and there are many of them in Legion life, showed 
clearly not only the nature of the ostentatiously advertised "democracy" 
in the Legion, where there are allegedly no ranks and rich and poor are 
equal. It also showed the fundamental difference between the vital in-
terests of the ordinary legionnaires, the former soldiers, and the heads 
of the Legion, the rich businessmen. The legionnaire who was compelled 
to spend the night with his family in the window of the department store 
or on the stage of the theater needed the vast housing construction pro-
gram as much as he needed air. But this program was not acceptable to 
the Legion commander and his circle because it was against their interests. 
When we read the "recommendations", full of frantic hatred of progress 
and democracy and voicing hostility toward peace, adopted by the Legion's 
national convention, we can clearly see how antagonistic these anti-popu-
lar writings are to the majority of the legionnaires. It would be naive 
to think that the legionnaires, former front-line fighters familiar with 
the horrors of war, have been completely uninfluenced by that great striv-
ing for peace which is characteristic of the entire American people today. 
Certainly also in 1919, when the American Legion was reestablished on a 
new mass basis, the majority of the front-line fighters entered it pre-
cisely because they sought a peaceful organization of their lives and the 
prevention of more wars. Here, for example, is how Justin Gray describes 
his intention on joining the Legion: 
... I wished that the Legion would become a great force in the de-
fense of peace; that it would support the majority against the minority; 
that it would fight for state housing construction, for price control 
and for racial equality." 
Even those front-line fighters who could not avoid realizing the 
reactionary nature of the statements of some of the Legion "leaders", be-
lieved in the power of democracy and believed that the millions of vet-
erans could realize their will, defend their interests and influence the 
leadership. 
Today these illusions have been scattered as ashes. The peace 
movement has grown immeasurably. And no matter how heavy the pressures 
exerted by the Legion top echelon, its rank-and-file members still at-
tempt to express their views on peace. And this desire is so strong 
that the middle level of Legion command, the heads of the posts and 
divisions, can no longer ignore it. The peaceful mood of the masses 
even penetrates the sessions of the national convention, meeting annually 
at luxurious resorts far from the homeless veterans, and the sessions of 
the Legion's executive committee which take place under the direct con-
trol of the "council of gods" of capitalist America, the National 
Association of Manufacturers. Here is an interesting case which enables 
one to understand how the Legion heads react to any stream of fresh wind 
bearing the breath of peace, which seems terrible to them. In May 1955 a

closed session of the Legion Executive Committee discussed a resolution 
on 1,1S foreign policy. One of the session's participants proposed a reso-
lution encouraging peaceful foreign policy measures. The draft resolu-
tion stated that the lessening of international tension had brought the 
US closer to genuine peace than at any time since the end of World War I. 
This innocent proposal struck the members of the executive committee 
with an impact as though someone had tried to set off a hydrogen bomb in 
the room where they were meeting. The seditious draft resolution was 
immediately turned down. 
It is not easy to arouse war-like feelings among people to whom war 
is not necessary but harmful, these people, in addition, being subject 
to the influence of public opinion which is coming out against war ever 
more actively. And it must be said that the Legion heads have to over-
come serious crises within their own organization. Despite the cruel 
punishments falling on the head of the apostate who dares to leave the 
organization, resignations of rank-and-file legionnaires are increasing. 
Between 1947 and 1950 the Legion lost over a million members. The 
Legion heads sought to correct this matter with the Korean war. They 
drew soldiers returning from this war into the Legion. However, this 
artificially organized influx has been replaced by a new, strong outflow. 
As the New  Republic affirms, despite the terror and the punishment 
of the recalcitrant, a series of quite significant rebellions has occurred 
since 1948 within the Legion. The ordinary Legion members are beginning 
to replace the leadership and to place people who are not so clearly con-
nected with monopolistic circles at the head of this organization. 
But the crisis which the Legion is undergoing, of course, does not 
change the Legion's reactionary nature. The power of military reaction 
in the US is as great as before. As formerly, the Legion is its strong-
hold and support. 
International imperialism is trying to take revenge for the defeats 
inflicted on it by the forces of peace. Reaction is mobilizing all its 
reserves. 
Here is how Legion Commander V. K. Daniels served these aims. Soon 
after his election to the position of Legion commander, he and three 
other legionnaires went to the Middle East, where the imperialists have 
increased their machinations against the peoples of the Arab countries, 
and primarily against the Egyptian people. Having visited Cairo, 
Daniels then spoke in the US, making a hostile statement against G. 
Nasser, Egypt's president. The commander did everything that he could, 
through congressmen associated with the Legion, to cut off economic aid 
to the Middle Eastern countries. He insisted on "condemning" the Soviet

Union in connection with the events in Hungary, considering such "condemna-
tion" a convenient reason for organizing military interference by the im-
perialists in the internal affairs of the Hungarian People's Republic. 
The American Legion also participated actively in the slanderous 
uproar organized by American reaction in connection with the Hungarian 
events. 
The descendants of Sergeant Patterson are asking for new pogroms, 
wars and provocations. However, history is moving forward and reaction 
will have more than a little work to keep even its stronghold and support, 
the American Legion, unconditionally obedient.

Behind ths Labor-Union Screen G. Kulikova 
The articles and speeches of George Meany... The voice of this inex-
haustible orator is heard on the radio, resounds from the platform at 
meetings, gatherings and conventions, comes from university lecture 
stands, and its sweet syrup flows about the tables in the banquet halls 
of the luxurious hotels in the American capital city. 
What is the topic of the oratory of George Meany, President of the 
American Federation (4 Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations 
(AFL and CIO), which have 16 million workers of various industries as 
members? Is his voice perhaps thundering forth in defense of the needs 
and hopes of the American worker and appealing for a fight for his rights 
and vital interests? Especially since there is something to worry about 
here, something to sound the alarm about. Recent years in the US have 
been characterized by serious attacks by reaction against the labor unions, 
by an intensification of exploitation, by an increase in taxes, and by a 
decrease in real. wages. 
But the head of the AFL and CIO is not devoting his eloquence to 
these vital problems. Like a memorized lesson, he repeats from day to 
day scandalous nonsense, setting one's teeth on edge, about the conspir-
acies of "international Communism" and its "drive toward world domina-
tion." He advises a further armaments race and the creation of anti-
Soviet military blocs, and appeals to the Western powers to refuse 
cooperation with. the Soviet Union. 
He pounces violently on all those who defend a policy of peaceful 
coexistence and friendship with the countries of the socialist camp. 
At the American Legion convention he howls about the "Red Bear" 
which allegedly intends to "attack" America. At a Catholic University 
commencement he grieves because at some places in the US "indifference 
to the threat of Communism" is appearing. At the National Academy of 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation he advises stopping the exchange of 
delegations with the Soviet Union and the people's democracies. At a 
banquet organized by construction companies he turns on the owners with 
reproaches t they, you see, are not fighting against the "Red Terror" 
decisively enough. In saying these things, he is in no way embarrassed 
by the circumstance that the hands of the police whom he is addressing 
are stained with the blood of striking workers or that the owners are not 
union members but enemies of the workers. 
No matter where Meany speaks, at a labor-union conference, on the 
radio, or at an assembly of inveterate reactionaries like the American 
Legion, everywhere he constantly appeals for aggression against the 
Soviet Union. He himself is a fervent advocate of the "crusade against 
Russia" and of the theory of "liberation" of the people's democracies,

i.e., of enslaving them to American capital. He is not only an enthusi-
astic supporter, but also an active participant, of plans intended to 
eliminate the power of the peoples and return capitalism to the USSR and 
the other socialist countries. 
In distributing lies and scandal, Meany pretends to express the 
opinion of the workers who belong to the AFL - CIO. "We," "us," the 
"labor unions," the "rank-and-file workers" - these words literally per-
meate his language. However the facts show that millions of American 
workers, as well as, by the way, even entire labor unions, in no way 
share the opinions which are so frequently expressed in their name by 
the man who is the head of the American labor unions in order to leave 
them without leadership. 
How did it happen that the head of the labor union association in 
the US turned out to be one of the worst sworn enemies of the first 
workers' government in the world, joining shameless warmongers in calling 
for military action against the Soviet Union? 
This question can only be answered by becoming acquainted, if only 
briefly, with the peculiarities of the labor movement in the United 
States. 
The American Federation of Labor was born in the days of a great 
upsurge of the labor movement, when the proletariat of this country was 
stubbornly fighting for an 8-hour workday. This was in the 1880's of 
the last century. A mighty-wage of strikes carried along all sorts of 
demagogues and traitors who regarded the labor organizations as profit-
able business. For decades the labor unions were the private preserve of 
the highly paid top echelon of the laboring class, the so-called "worker 
aristocracy", which feeds itself with crumbs from the grand table of the 
monopolies._ The Federation was organized by crafts and consisted of 
numerous small unions. The union czars, the "bosses," warred with each 
other for the right to lead the workers of one or another trade, or, 
more accurately, to see who would get their membership dues and thus be-
come rich. A man who seized leadership, placed his people in key posi-
tions and thus ensured for himself many years of "presidency," became 
the master and acquired an income. "In his small kingdom he was almost 
a demigod, surrounded by a throng of courtiers who flattered and in-
dulged him," wrote Fortune magazine, describing a typical union boss. 
Twenty-five, thirty or even forty years were common periods of leader-
ship by a single man in the unions belonging to the AFL. Matters 
reached such a peculiar state that some of them proclaimed themselves 
president for life. 
Relations between these union barons and the owners were also 
peculiar. They were based on the opportunistic theory that the interests 
of labor and capital were the same, that it was possible to establish 
-167-

Approved For Release 2001/07/28 : CIA-RDP65-00756R000300270001-9 
peace and cooperation between the classes. This thoroughly false theory 
let down deep roots in the US, and found enthusiastic admirers and fol-
lowers. Certainly it was quite convenient for the apologists of imperial-
ism, who even now reiterate how "exceptional" is the American way of 
development and describe the system of "free ownership" as a special kind 
of capitalism not subject to its laws. From this also sprang the thesis 
that there are "no warring classes" in the United States, a thesis enthusi-
astically held by the union leaders and used to avoid the class struggle 
and the implacable struggle for the interests of the workers. 
These words of V. I. Lenin apply fully to the reactionary leaders of 
the American unions: "persons within the worker movement who belong to 
the opportunistic school are better defenders of the bourgeoisie than the 
bourgeois themselves. Without their leadership of the workers, the bour-
geoisie would not maintain itself in power." 
All the leaders of the American Federation of Labor have been this 
type of person, beginning with the first president, Samuel Gompers, a 
zealous proponent of the theory of cooperation with the monopolies. As 
early as 1915 V. I. Lenin warned the workers of the United States and 
other countries of the world, showing the treacherous role of the leaders 
of the AFL at that time. He stated that "Gompers and persons like him 
are not representatives of the working class: they represent only the 
aristocracy and the bureaucracy of the working class." 
Gompers, Green, Meany, one replacing the other as president of the 
Federation, belong to the same category of stewards of the monopolies, 
and henchmen of imperialism in the worker movement. The essence of their 
policy consists of forcing upon the unions the idea of "cooperation" with 
monopolistic capital, or, more accurately, of subordination to it, of 
renunciation of the working class's right to government power, and of 
support of an imperialistic foreign policy. 
In no other country have opportunistic, reformist leaders caused so 
much harm to the labor movement as in the United States of America. In 
no other country has the bourgeoisie succeeded on such a scale in buying 
out the heads of the working class as in the US. Nowhere are the cor-
rupt ideas of subordinating the interests of the workers to the interests 
of capital implEmented as openly and shamelessly or are the labor unions, 
these mass organizations intended to unite the workers' efforts in the 
struggle for their vital rights, so undermined. The American monopolies 
could not have achieved all this if they had not been helped by their 
agents, the opportunistic leaders, the "lieutenants of capital" in the 
labor movement, as Lenin called them, if they had not exerted every effort 
to split the ranks of the workers, to fetter the unions, and to turn them 
into an appendage of the machine of the capitalist state.

It was 1917. The Great October Socialist Revolution had triumphed. 
How should this victory be regarded? There was only one opinion on this 
score in the Executive Council of the American Federation of Labor. The 
birth of the proletarian state held the ruin of capitalism, and threatened 
to undermine the way of life so close to the hearts (and especially-to 
the pockets) of the union barons. In the hostile howl that rose from the 
bourgeois world the shrill voice of the American union leaders was also 
heard. Strangle and eliminate the country of the workers and peasants - 
that is that these people wished, dressed in the costume of labor leaders 
and pretending that they represented the interests of the workers. 
Many years went by. Many changes occurred. The capitalist states 
were compelled not only to discontinue the military and economic blockade 
of the Soviet Union, but even to enter into economic, commercial and cul-
tural relations with it. The government of the United States also estab-
lished normal diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. More than that, 
the US and the USSR were allies during World War II against Hitlerite 
Fascism and Japanese imperialism. 
Only the leaders of the American Federation of Labor did not change. 
Vying with the most shameless reactionaires, they continued a fervent 
anti-Soviet campaign. Each step along the path of progress, each move 
toward improved relations with the Soviet government was accompanied by 
their hysterical howls. Paying tribute to their indefatigability and 
zeal, the Honorary Chairman of the US Communist Party, Willian Foster, 
noted in his book, The Twilight of World Capitalism: "The conservative 
leaders frequently surpass the capitalists themselves in their warlike 
chauvinism and their pathological hatred of the Soviet Union and the 
Communist Party.? 
The life of the American labor union bureaucracy was disturbed in 
the 1930's when, disregarding its will and wishes, mass labor organiza-
tions, organized along industrial lines rather than along narrow craft 
lines, began to spring up. A severe economic crisis, changing to a 
lingering pre-war depression, stimulated the stormy growth of the union 
movement. Laws recognizing the rights of the unions (particularly, the 
so-called Wagner Act) passed during this period were the result of the 
ever-strengthening labor movement in the US. 
The heads of the AFL saw a challenge to themselves and their craft 
organizations in the formation of the industrial unions in which all 
workers participated, even the lowest paid. In 1.935 a group of such 
unions was expelled from the AFL. A second trade-union center, the 
Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), grew up. Its creation 
agitated all working America. The membership of the unions began to 
increase rapidly. During the last 20 years the number of workers 
organized into unions in the US has quadrupled and now totals 16 million.

Fora number of years the new labor-union center played a quite 
progressive role in the development of the labor movement in the country. 
The energetic activity of the labor unions and the powerful strike move-
ment they developed led to a substantial increase in minimum wages, a 
reduction in the length of the workday, and an improvement in working con-
ditions. The achievements of these years must also include the creation 
of a kind of social security system, the acknowledgment by many enter-
prises of the right of the workers to paid vacations, etc. All this was 
achieved through violent battles and a long and stuboorn struggle which 
was successful thanks to the increasing organization and unity of the 
workers. 
* * * 
At the end of 1955 the two labor union associations, the American 
Federation of Labor (AFL) and the Congress of Industrial Organizations 
(CIO) were merged. This became possible partly because during the postwar 
years the position of the CIO leaders had come close to the position of 
the Green-Meany clique heading the Federation. This approach was espe-
cially noticeable in the field of international relations: the heads of 
both organizations actively supported the aggressive US foreign policy, 
the policy of building up military blocs and fanning war hysteria. But 
the main reason prompting the leaders of the AFL and the CIO to take this 
step was that they were afraid the initiative would slip from their hands. 
The idea of unity had always been very popular among the US workers. 
They realize that the weakness of the labor movement is the result of 
breaking it down too far, of craft organizations, and of unnecessary and 
harmful rivalry among the unions. This made itself especially felt dur-
ing the postwar period when the reactionary forces developed an attack on 
the democratic rights of the people. One after the other, Draconian 
anti-labor laws were passed. The most vile of them were: the Taft-
Hartley Act, the McCarran Act, and the Brownell-Butler Act. Using these 
laws, the reactionary circles directed a blow against the labor figures 
who were most active and most true to the cause of the working class. 
Whole unions were affected by the blow, namely, those that fought most 
decisively for the workers' demands. Many strikes were suppressed and 
the unions and their leaders were placed under police control. 
An attack also developed against the people's standard of living. 
During the postwar years the workers' share in the national income fell 
steadily. The constant increases in prices, apartment rent, the cost of 
public services, etc., reduced all the workers' gains, achieved at the 
price of bitter strike battles, to nothing. The whole burden of the 
armaments race lay on the shoulders of the ordinary people. The rapidly 
increasing taxes are devouring at least one-third of the workers' and 
employees' income. According to union data, the income of at least 
two-thirds of American families was lower than the officially recognized 
minimum needed to live on.

Only by uniting their forces and by an organized struggle would it 
be possible to repulse reaction's attack. Vast groups of workers under-
stood that it was time to put an end to the smallness of units and to 
the craft organization in the labor movement. The question of unifying 
the unions became the order of business of the day. It was dictated by 
life itself, and had to be resolved regardless of whether the right-wing 
union leaders wished it. 
The heads of the AFL and the CIO understood the strength that the 
striving of the masses toward union unification was acquiring. And they 
could not avoid sensing the danger that, in view of the anti-labor ap-
proach by the monopolies and the furious armaments race, they might lose 
control of the movement for unification. It was important to them to 
seize the initiative and to direct the movement for unity along a channel 
acceptable to the monopolistic circles. 
* * * 
'long before the unification congress of the AFL - CIO, the press of 
the large monopolies began strenuously to publicize the President of the 
AFL, George Meany. The large weeklies praised his gentlemanly manners 
and bourgeois habits. Meany, they wrote, is a completely "decent," 
well-brought up fellow; you see, he rides to work in a luxurious limou-
sine, is a judge of French wines, plays the piano and is even a poet. 
In this way the monopolistic circles expressed their approval of the 
activity of this union boss. 
What are the virtues of this so-called "labor leader" which are 
earning such unmistakeable good-will in Wall Street? It is certainly 
not his gentlemanly manners or of the exterior of this stout man with the 
flabby, fat face, who resembles a banker or manufacturer. 
George Meany began his career in the plumbers union. Becoming 
head of one of its divisions in his youth, he gained the company's good 
will because, as the Morgan magazine, Time, noted, "he never struck." 
"The employers respected the word of the devout Catholic, Meany," 
admits the magazine, apparently considering devoutness and humility 
very valuable qualities in a labor-union figure. It was obviously be-
cause of these qualities that Meany soon became president of the New York 
State Federation of Labor, and in 1939, when the aging Frank Morrison re-
tired, he was appointed Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL. 
Al]. his life George Meany has called on the American workers not to 
fight to obtain their rights, but to agree quietly and amicably to the 
prejudicing of these rights. He has not devoted his efforts to organiz-
ing opposition to capital, but to suppressing the struggle of the 
exploited against the exploiters and oppressors. Along with this he, 
like other opportunistic leaders, has had to continually maneuver, con-
cealing with loud, demagogic phrases, his capitulation and cringing 
before capital.

Approved For Release 2001/07/28 : CIA-RDP65-00756R000300270001-9 
Here is one of the characteristic dramatizations which Meany played 
as far back as the 1930's, concealing his true face from the workers. A 
bitter struggle for increased unemployment benefits was going on. It 
took an especially severe form in New York. Assuaging the mood of the 
mass of enemployed, Meany engaged in a noisy, demagogic campaign against 
the Government's New York District Administrator, General Johnson. "Meany 
grappled with the stormy General Johnson," said Time magazine, breathless 
with delight. "Meany and Johnson publicly denounced each other in state-
ments on the radio and in the newspapers.., and peacefully dined together 
in private." 
Many years have passed since then and Meany has long since ceased 
to conceal his amicable relations with contractors, factory owners, plant 
owners, and merchants, in a word, with all the magnates of capital. He 
meets them quite openly as well as privately. Not many festive dinners, 
lunches and suppers are held in the restaurants of the fashionable 
Washington and New York hotels without his participation. He drinks the 
health of industrial and financial big shots and they condescendingly 
clap him on the shoulder and thank him for his faithful service. 
"During my whole life I never struck, never headed a strike, never 
ordered a strike, and never had anything to do with picketing," Meany 
admitted once. And this at a time when the workers are defending their 
vital rights in stubborn strike battles! About 30 million workers and 
employees of different trades have participated in strikes during the 
past 10 years. And only the right-wing socialist leaders of the labor 
unions have remained apart from the fight. Can there be a greater be-
trayal of the interests of the American workers! 
Here is the kind of program that Meany proposed to the unions on 
the eve of their unification congress: "The AFL - CIO," he wrote in 
the New York Times Magazine, "will be ready and able to play an important 
part in establishing and maintaining peace in industry. The interests 
of the workers and of the owners are interconnected rather than hostile. 
The incomes of both depend on the continued prosperity of any given 
enterprise and of the country as a whole. Neither can produce without 
the other... The majority of conflicts between workers and management 
can be settled by peaceful means. And this is occurring now. The only 
difficulty is to work out a method for settling exceptional cases, be-
fore a destructive strike or lock-out occurs." 
Meany concluded the presentation of his program for class coopera-
tion with a proposal for concluding a "non-aggression pact" between the 
unions and the monopolies! 
"It is our duty to impose strict government control on the workers 
we represent. It is our duty to explain to the workers that they can-
not receive the wages and working conditions that they want."

Approved For Release 2001/07/28 : CIA-RDP65-00756R000300270001-9 
These are Meany's words. But they are spoken in the language of the 
owners. All the boundaries between such "labor" leaders and the capital-
ists have been obliterated. The capitalist is plundering, and Meany 
blesses this robbery and appeals for humility to those who are robbed. 
The capitalist intensifies the squeeze of cruel exploitation, and Meany 
urges the oppressed workers, weakened by the monstrous sweat-shop system, 
hotto rebel. 
* * * 
The treacherous activity of the reactionary labor-union leaders 
toward the workers would likely have been worth only half as mach to the 
monopolistic circles if it had not been supplemented by anti-Soviet prop-
aganda and by active participation in the realization of an aggressive 
foreign policy policy for the US. Meany, fortunately, is most zealous, 
most active and most diligent in this direction. He did not conceal his 
hostile feeling toward the Soviet Union even during the war, when the 
whole world was carried away by admiration for the heroism of the Soviet 
people in annihilating the Fascist horde. At this time Meany was worried 
only because the influence of the Communists was increasing among the 
workers. 
What can be said then about the "cold war" years, when all America 
was in the grip of violent propaganda of hostility and hate, and any 
expression in favor of peaceful coexistence with the socialist countries 
was considered almost a crime. That is when these sword-bearers of the 
monopolies appeared everywhere. They called for a military campaign 
against the USSR and demanded immediate overthrow of the Soviet power. 
And how many slanderous inventions were born in the bosom of the 
AFL, and were readily placed by Meany and Co. as salable goods on the 
anti-Soviet market! How much, for example, does the slander about 
"forced labor" in the USSR cost? How many times has it been put for-
ward by the American reactionaries to poison the international atmos-
phere? How many times have US delegations brought it up for discussion 
at sessions of the General Assembly of the UN, drawing public attention 
away from the most important international problems? 
However, this whole "problem" was a fantasy of a certain interna-
tional committee of the AFL. "Theorists" of every kind from among the 
traitors to the socialists are at work in this union "state department." 
In particular, the renegade Lovestone plays no small role. He is con-
sidered apparently not without some basis, to be the author of many of 
the speeches which Meany reads from paper. 
There is war in Korea. Unprecedented excitement reigns in the AFL 
Executive Council. With great enthusiasm they begin to disseminate 
chauvinist slogans. The union bureaucrats picture every strike and 
every attempt by the workers to improve their working conditions almost 
as though it were treason. When the US was compelled to seek an 
-173-

Approved For Release 2001/07/28 : CIA-RDP65-00756R000300270001-9 
armistice, the leaders of the AFL immediately appeared among thossA who 
were openly opposed to ending the armed conflict in Korea. The American 
newspaper, Worker, then justly noted the striking resemblance between the 
positions of Meariy and of the American puppet in Southern Korea, Syngman 
Rhee: each was demanding the continuation of the blood bath. 
All humanity sighed with relief when, in the summer of 1954, as a 
result of the peaceful initiative of the Soviet Union in Geneva, agree-
ment was reached to conclude the 8-year old war in Indo-China. In 
Washington alone, tempers were not restored for a long time. The col-
lapse of the aggressive plans and expansionist dreams caused an outburst 
of indignation there. Frothing at the mouth, Meany cried from the plat-
form at the American Legion Convention that the Geneva agreement ',would 
go down in history as a point from which there is no return." 
By the way, Geneva more than once annoyed the warmongers and their 
union servants. The meeting of the heads of state of the four powers 
which took place in this city in the summer of 1955 seriously shook the 
ground under their feet. But even with a lessening of international 
tension, Meany and his associates continued their black deeds. They do 
not wish to reckon with the "spirit of Geneva"; they will have nothing 
to do with the desires of the peoples who are eager to be free of the 
threat of a new world war. 
The idea of peaceful coexistence between states with different 
social systems is undergoing a fierce attack from the adherents of the 
"position of strength" policy. In a whole series of speeches and 
articles, Meany is trying to vilify this idea, dear to the heart of 
every ordinary man. "A serious danger is threatening the free world 
today," he warns his audience. "It is engendered by the stupid, mis-
taken opinion that we can safely accept the idea of coexistence with 
Soviet Russia," 
Commenting on these inflamatory statements of Meany's, the news-
paper, Daily People's World, wrote: ?It must seem strange to the people 
of other countries that in the United States the bitterest opponent of 
peaceful coexistence between capitalist countries and socialist coun-
tries is a union leader." 
Meany is trying to justify his anti-Communist position. A com-
plete "theoryn? claiming to be scientific, has been worked out for this 
purpose. It is based entirely on one false principle: the concept of 
class peace and class cooperation. Since the workers and the owners 
have identical interests, affirm Meany and his accomplices, their enemy 
is identical. This enemy is Communism. Under Communism there cannot 
be private capital, private ownership, or private industry. And con-
sequently, they say, there cannot be a free trade-union movement. As

one can see, these pseudo-theorists consider union "freedom" to consist 
only of attack by reaction, anti-labor laws and persecution, and union 
subjugation to opportunistic doctrines concealing lawlessness and ex-
ploitation. To defend the interests of the monopolies by identifying 
them with the workers' interests, this is what Meany considers genuine 
union freedom. "The free unions of America," he writes in the above-
mentioned article in the New York Times Magazine, "are fighting against 
Communism in their own country and in the whole world. This unchanging 
opposition of the American union movement toward Communism is providing 
a basis of security for American business." Such is the "scientific 
basis" inspiring the anti-Soviet activity of Meany and Co. 
It is in this very theory that it is necessary to look for the main 
motives which led the reactionary leaders to waive their egoistical, 
mercenary interests and to approve the merger of the AFL and CIO. To 
turn the consolidated union center into a strong force for the "struggle 
with Communism" and to make it a hotbed of anti-Soviet propaganda--this 
is the aim of Meany and the other reactionary union leaders. It is 
enough to study the foreign policy resolution adopted at the consolida-
tion congress. What doesn't it contains Appeals for an even greater 
armaments race and an expansion of the military blocs, the demand not to 
let the People's Republic of China into the UN, attacks against the idea 
of coexistence, appeals for "the liberation" of the people's democracies, 
etc.$ etc. All this was flavored with sizeable doses of anti-Soviet 
slander and demagogic statements about the "threat of Communism." 
The ruling circles of the US did not oppose the consolidation of 
the two union centers. "I hail the consolidation of the unions," spoke 
the Governor of the state of New York, Harriman, at the consolidation 
congress, "because the American unions have done more in the struggle 
with Communist subversion in the country and abroad, and have supported 
our government more straightforwardly than any other organizations in 
the us." Thus the monopolies expressed their approval of the action of 
Meany and his clique, through the words of this millionaire.

In October 1945 the World Federation of Trade Unions was estab-
lished. This was the most representative and inclusive international 
organization in the history of the labor movement. It included all the 
large national union centers, all, with the exception of the American 
Federation of Labor. The top echelon of the AFL was not in favor of 
the democratic forces which united to consolidate the victories 
achieved in the struggle against Fascism, and to ensure a firm peace 
in the future,c 
Even during the war the American Federation of Labor began to raise 
a fund to help the European unions. The last salvos had not died out 
when the Federation's ambassadors appeared in Europe. They came to help

reestablish the unions, they said innocently? As a matter of fact, their 
purpose was to split the ranks of workers and to repulse the upsurge of 
the labor movement resulting from the victory of democratic forces over 
Fascism. 
In Italy the "union" emissaries Dubinsky and Antonini were active, 
in France, Irving Brown, and in Germany, Rutz. They squandered money, 
bribing the labor leaders, spread anti-Soviet slander, and gathered the 
Quislings and Vichyites of yesterday around them. This was a carefully 
prepared plan to prevent the unification of the worker class. Its aim 
was the creation of a new international organization subordinated to the 
aggressive policy of the US ruling circles. 
This plan was created by the top echelon of the AFL. The union 
leaders served only to carry out the will of those who determine and 
the political program of the monopolistic circles. It was no accident 
that the ambassadors of this top echelon in Europe were also agents of 
the US State Lepartment and of the American secret political policel the 
FBI. In essence, the name AFL was only a screen concealing hardened 
spies and intelligence agents. 
We must give the French workers their due; they soon recognized the 
underlying intentions of the American salesmen operating under a union 
cloak and evicted Irving Brown from their country. "This lackey of the 
American reactionaries," wrote the workers' newspaper,La Vie Ouvrier, on 
31 October 1946 "tried to make connections with everyone in France who 
wished to fight against the World Federation of Trade Unions. He sought 
out everyone, who, under the cover of anti-Communism, was ready to de-
stroy union unity. He drew in Munichites and Vichyites, seeking to 
create from them a group of advocates of a new war." 
Brown was compelled to leave France and set up headquarters in 
Brussels. Here, in the luxurious Atlanta Hotel, was also located the 
suite of the so-called "European Bureau of the American Federation of 
Labor," a nest of spying and provocations, the center of anti-labor and 
subversive activity. From here, the threads of the conspiracy stretched 
into the countries of Western and Eastern Europe. Here the secret war 
against the international labor movement was begun. 
The reactionary press thinks highly of Meany because he was first 
among American union leaders to come out against the international asso-
ciation of workers, the World Federation of Trade Unions. Meany has per-
formed quite a few such "services." He directly supervised the perni-
cious activity of the American agents operating in the European unions. 
It was certainly not without reason that he boasted that AFL money 
"split" the General Confederation of Labor of France." Actually, quite 
a lot of money was spent for the subversive activity. A figure of 160 
million dollars was mentioned at the AFL congress in 1948 as having been

Approved For Release 2001/07/28 : CIA-RDP65-00756R000300270001-9 
spent to "bring life to the free union movement" ("free" in the American 
meaning). But, obviously the expenditures were not limited to this sum. 
In addition, it was discovered that considerable funds come to the union 
bosses from funds of the President and State Department of the US. The 
reactionary American newspaper, New York Journal American, admitted in May 
1953 that the main center of American espionage, the US Central Intelli-
gence Agency, "gave the AFL almost 3 million dollars for conducting secret 
political activity in France, Italy and some other countries." 
But the plans of international reaction failed. The AFL money did 
not undermine the General Confederation of Labor of France, nor did it 
undermine other labor centers in Europe. In 1952, after a 6-week trip to 
Europe, Meany was convinced of the stability and popularity of the pro-
gressive labor organizations in France and Italy. This made the union 
boss so wild that he not only threatened his henchmen, but also sharply-
criticized the European ruling circles, which, in his opinion, were not 
sufficiently fervent in the fight against Communism. "They let us work 
on this, but do not wish to raise a finger themselves," complained this 
defender of the interests of US monopolistic circles. 
International reaction's plans to destroy the World Federation of 
Trade Unions also fell through. The withdrawal in 1949 of the Congress 
of Industrial Organizations, the British Trades Union Congress and a 
number of small trade unions did not destroy the Federation. It not only 
maintained its influence, but even grew stronger, increased its member-
ship and acquired great authority among the workers. 
The connection between the policy of preparing for war and the sub-
versive activity of the trade-union schismatics is very direct. It is 
not difficult to be convinced of this. It is enough to remember the 
attitude of the leaders of the International Confederation of "Free" 
Trade Unions (ICFTU) towards the heroic struggle of the French dock work-
ers against deliveries of American arms to West Germany. Irving Brown, 
an active worker in the Confederation, was sent to Marseilles. According 
to evidence of the French newspaper, Le Soil', a group of cutthroats re-
cruited by him came with him. Writing about the activity of this group 
of criminals, the American magazine, Business Week, stated: "From time 
to time first one and then another of the confirmed Communists had to be 
brought to the hospital. Some of these Communists unexpectedly disap-
peared into the dirty water at the wharf." 
The leaders of the ICFTU christened such gangs, "vigilance commit-
tees," and tried to convince the public that they were formed by the 
workers themselves to fight against the "Communist threat." 
Recently there has been a notable development of contacts between 
different countries. There is a constant exchange of parliamentary, cul-
tural, sports, trade-union and other delegations. Naturally, the 
-177-

Approved For Release 2001/07/28 : CIA-RDP65-00756R000300270001-9 
possibility of establishing relations with the workers of the socialist 
countries has received the attention of the trade-union public in America 
also. This has been encouraged since there has been an exchange of agri-
cultural, construction, medical, journalist, etc., delegations between 
the US and the USSR. "Why not exchange labor delegations?" many union 
workers have proposed. But, like everything else that might lead to a 
strengthening of friendship and cooperation between the peoples, this pro-
posal was shoved aside due to the emnity of Meany and his cohorts. They 
do not want the ordinary people of America to know the truth about the 
country of socialism. Let them live on slanderous nonsense, the fruits 
of the evil imagination of the adherents of aggression. "The smiles of 
the Soviet leaders are more dangerous than threats,? admonish the heads 
of the AFL-CIO in supporting the "cold war." 
At the dictation of the bosses from across the ocean, the Interna-
tional Confederation of "Free" Trade Unions issued a directive forbidding 
all the national centers which were members of the ICFTU to exchange 
delegations with trade unions belonging to the World Federation of Trade 
Unions. This is the way that the trade union bureaucrats once again 
undertook to strengthen friendship and mutual understanding among the 
workers of different countries. Thus they once again proved that they 
are not at all guided by a striving toward peace as they demagogically 
affirm in their endless statements. 
To understand thoroughly how harmful the schismatic actions of these 
trade union accomplices of the monopolies, of the American trade union 
bureaucracy, are to the worker class, let us pose this question: who 
will benefit from a split in the international labor movement? It is 
quite clear that the strengthening of friendship and cooperation, con-
stant communication, exchange of delegations, etc., could bring nothing 
but good to the workers of the different countries. As far as the 
monopolistic bosses are concerned, it is no secret that they are afraid 
of the development of such relations, of the workers of the Western 
world learning about the achievements of the people's democracies, and 
of the strengthening of unity among the workers in general. Consequently, 
the actions of the American union bureaucracy and of the top echelon of 
the ICFTU are of benefit only to the capitalists. They cause great harm 
to the workers and to the whole international labor movement. 
In serving Wall Street, Meany and his cohorts are actively helping 
the imperialists in realizing their colonial policy. Take, for example, 
the attitude of the top echelon of the AFL-CIO toward the aggression by 
England, France and Israel against Egypt. They kept quiet when the 
troops of the imperialist usurpers committed outrages on Egyptian soil, 
killing thousands of peaceful inhabitants and destroying ancient 
Egyptian cities. And this is not surprising if one keeps in mind that 
the leaders of the AFL-CIO echo their masters in expressing indignation

at Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal. One might wonder what 
business of Meany and his clique this was. Certainly the nationalization 
of the Suez Canal in no way affects the situation of the workers of the 
US or of any other country. The Egyptian workers gain from this move, as 
do the entire Egyptian people, who threw offbhe chains of colonial oppres-
sion and who entered the path of freedom and independence. 
Nevertheless, Meany fought for "internationalization" of the canal, 
i.e., for giving it into the hands of the monopolies. He even took it 
upon himself to send a special letter to Secretary of State Dulles pro-
posing that "pressure be put on" Egypt. A resolution of the Executive 
Council of the AFL-CIO was attached to the letter. In it, crude attacks 
against the Egyptian government and President Nasser of the Republic of 
Egypt alternate with appeals for "internationalization" of thea canal. 
Is it possible to express oneself more clearly on the question of 
the national liberation struggle of the colonial peoples? 
* * * 
At the end of 1952, an underground organizations Wolnosc 
Niepodleglosc (WIN), was exposed in People's Poland. It was engaged in 
espionage and the preparation of sabotage and terrorist acts and was 
financed from the US. The leaders of IN confessed their guilt to 
Poland's state security organs and admitted that they had received more 
than a million dollars from American intelligence agencies. The under-
ground workers received additional subsidies from a certain agent known 
as "The Brown One." It developed that Irving Brown, who is both a trade-
union worker and an agent of the US Central Intelligence Agency, had 
disguised himself under this nickname. 
"The Brown One", Brown, has large sums at his disposal which come 
from appropriations made under the so-called Mutual Security Act. This 
law, unprecedented in international practice, earmarked 100 million dol-
lars for active subversion in the socialist countries. In succeeding 
years Congress has continued to make generous appropriations for these 
purposes. A considerable part of this money also passed through the 
hands of the trade union agents. 
As far back as the convention of the American Federation of Labor 
in 19480 Brown openly declared that the "AFL is creating a US fifth 
column in the people's democracies to operate in favor of the US." 
This type of activity had to become one of the chief aims of the Inter-
national Confederation of "Free" Trade Unions. And although at that 
time it was only in the planning stages, Brown, in the same statement, 
proclaimed that the first point in its program must be "assisting in 
the overthrow of the present governments of Eastern Europe." The 
Danish newspaper, Land og Folk, published a secret resolution of the 
executive council of the ICFTU. This resolution stated directly that one 
of the Confederation's aims was espionage in the people's democracies.

Other Personnel of this type also did not conceal the plans of reac-
tion with regard to the people's democracies. Meany, for example, made a 
special announcement in Which he called on the emigre organizations for 
support. With the help of the AFL, an espionage center called "Free 
Trade Unions in Exile" was organized. It contained not only Fascists and 
traitors hiding from the people's courts in the Eastern European coun-
tries, but also white-guard rabble who still cherish the dream of over-
throwing the Soviet system. 
The participation of US "trade union" agents in subversive activity 
has been proven in places other than Poland. It has been revealed that 
the top echelon of the AFL was connected with the reactionary underground 
in other countries also. For example, the American magazine, Reader's  
Digest, had to admit this in its pages. 
What a howl the trade-union servants of the warmongers raised in 
connection with the uns49gessful attempt to eliminate the people's demo-
cratic system and re-establish the power of feudal counts and capitalists 
in Hungary! A message to President Eisenhower, a telegram to Secretary 
of State Dulles an appeal to the UN. At this time Meany did not have a 
minutels Peace. He spoke on the radio, wrote articles, protested, de-
manded. More frequently than at any time he used the words, "workers," 
"trade unions," "we," "us," trying with all his might to prove that it 
was not he and his clique, but the American workers who were grieved by 
:the defeat of the Fascist-Horthyite hordes in Hungary. 
The Executive Council of the AFL-CIO was called and a declaration, 
full of anti-Soviet slanders, was adopted. Introduce UN "police forces" 
into Hungary, do not recognize the Kadar Workers' and Peasants,' Govern-
ment, and stop all cultural and scientific exchange with the Soviet 
Union; such were the demands of the American trade union top echelon. 
More than that, they also appealed for organization of an economic boy-
cott,of the Soviet Union, i.e., an attempt to re-establish the "cordon 
santlzhewhich was used against the young republic of workers and peasants 
at the very beginning of Soviet power. The leaders of the International 
Confederation of "Free" Trade Unions also held this line. 
In order to complete the portrait of George Meany, we present one 
more fact. Recently in the United States a book was published by the 
so-called Un-American Activities Committee of the House of Representatives. 
This was a coll.ection of articles filled with anti-Soviet slander and war 
propaganda. Here shameless, monstrous lies alternate with crude falsifi-
cations. The authors of the collection (a total of 120) include the most 
shameless American reactionaries and militarists. Here is the chief of 
the secret police, Edgar Hoover; the provocateur, Louis Budenz, who ap-
peared as a false witness at trials of Communists; and a whole group of 
generals driven by the thirst for blood.

And George Meany was willing to appear among them and to urge on, or 
at least keep up with the eager propagandists of aggression. Well, it is 
just among the proponents of war that he belongs. 
At the same time it is quite clear that there is a deep gulf between 
him and the vast mass of US workers. All his activity and all his speeches 
and articles glaringly contradict the interests of the ordinary peoples. 
And no matter how many times this arms-bearer of Wall-Street repeats the 
pronouns, "we" and "us", he will not succeed in convincing the world pub-
lic that he expresses the opinion of the American people. The facts show 
that the ordinary people think and speak quite differently. 
Voices demanding changes in the present US foreign policy are being 
heard more and more frequently at union conventions and at workerst meet-
ings and conferences. Many union figures, even such prominent ones as 
Walter Reuther, president of the United Automobile Workers, Potofsky, 
head of the garment workers, and others have criticized the present 
policy. 
Before us lies the newspaper, Labor News, published by the unions 
in Rochester (New York). "They calm us with fairy tales of how," the 
editorial states, "everything is well in the world and we can defend our-
selves by creating more and more modern destructive military machines. 
But everything cannot be well in the world while we, the people of the 
West, do not exert all our efforts to learn to live in peace and coopera-
tion with other peoples, including the Russians and the Chinese." 
Nor is it superfluous to recall the resolution adopted at the con-
ference of Illinois unions. It calls for negotiations "at every pos-
sible level, to eliminate the conflict between East and West." 
It is apparent from this that the American workers have certain 
aims and the reactionary union top echelon has quite other aims. 
The ordinary people in America want peace and broad cooperation with 
the USSR and the whole camp of democracy and socialism. But the union 
barons are cooperating with the monopolies and helping them in the prepa-
ration of war and other armaments. This is the tragedy of the American 
labor movement. 
The workers have become sick to death of the accomplice of the war-
mongers, George Meany. But the Wall Street bosses approvingly pat him 
on the shoulder.

GREAT BRITIAN 
ulle English bourgeoisie has always stood and con-
tinues to stand at the forefront of the enemies of the 
Liberation movement of mankind." -- I. V. Stalin 
Captains of British IndUstry P. Snegov 
In the center of London, not far from the luxurious royal palaces 
and massive government buildings, stands an ordinary house with nothing 
noteworthy about its appearance. Its picture does not appear on the 
colorful postcards with views of the English capital. They do not show 
it to the tourists who usually throng in front of Buckingham Palace, 
Westminster or the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street. Never-
theless, the house, and mainly its residents, deserve that more be known 
about them. It is especially important that the truth be known about 
them. 
The head office of the Federation of British Industries is located 
in this house. This organization does not attempt to be well-known 
and does not publicize its activity. It prefers to operate behind the 
scenes and to do its business quietly. Here honorable gentlemen who 
discuss and pass laws in Parliament meet. The government rules the 
country. But the real, commanding and omnipotent rulers of Great Britain 
and the British Empire are found in this modest house at No. 21 Tothill 
, Street. 
The members of the British Parliament, the ministers, generals, 
ambassadors, government officials and numerous government committees, 
commissions and offices only carry out the wish of the Grand Council of 
the Federation of British Industries. They give its wishes the form of 
legislative acts and governmental decrees, orders and instructions. 
They carry out the Federation's orders implicitly. And they do this 
especially eagerly because the majority belong to the same class as the 
members of the Grand Council. Its orders are published nowhere and are 
seldom spoken aloud, but those for whom they are intended always under-
stand them. Most frequently these orders are simply anticipated. If 
some minister, member of Parliament or high government official does not 
understand, or even more, if he does not do what was expected of him, he 
simply would not be a minister, member of parliament or high government 
official; in Great Britain, as in any capitalist country, it is impos-
sible to ignore the will of the ruling class with impunity. And the 
Federation of British Industries is its most powerful and authoritative 
organization, an association of industrial, commercial and financial 
oligarchs and monopolists. 
What is the Federation of British Industries? What is its role in 
the life of Great Britain? What influence does it have on the country's 
domestic and foreign policy? What is its interest in the armaments 
race? To attempt an answer to these questions, it is necessary to dwell 
briefly on the Federation's history and organization and on its past 
activity.

The Federation of British Industries was established in 1916. It 
was established to combat the growing worker movement, as a center from 
which to lead the attack on the vital rights of the working masses, to 
expand in the international arena, and to compete with the other imperi-
alist plunderers. The great British capitalist companies, in creating 
the Federation, also intended that it should represent their common 
interests in other national associations, governmental departments and 
international organizations. 
The Federation's task, states the "royal charter," is the "encourage-
ment, promotion, and protection of British industries of all kinds." This 
vague definition does not at all reveal the true purposes of the Federa-
tion of British Industries. 
The monopolists themselves, in the Register of British Manufacturers  
published in 1955, write that the basic task of the Federation of British 
Industries is to formulate policy for the country's industry, and also 
to deal with all aspects of industrial activity in Great Britain. How-
ever, the authors of this statement blurt out there and then that the 
Federation is a "strictly non-political" organization, apparently having 
in mind that it is above the ostentatious wrangles which occur between 
the leaders of the two main bourgeois parties, the Conservative Party 
and the Labour Party. 
The Register of British Manufacturers also gives a veiled indication 
of the methods by which the Federation operates. It states that "as 
national spokesman of industry the Federation deals directly with the 
government, the public and other organizations at home and overseas, or 
indirectly through its representation on numerous governmental and other 
bodies." 
The Federation's annual report for 1947 stated that it has repre-
sentatives in 36 ministries and other British governmental establish-
ments. In addition, it has confidential agents in more than 20 industrial, 
scientific, legal, commercial and educational organs which have consider-
able influence in the ruling circles of Great Britain. The Federation's 
representatives sit officially in the following ministries: board of 
trade, colonies, education, fuel and power, health, labour, transport and 
civil aviation; and in the following councils: scientific research, 
economic planning, the National Production Council operating under the 
chairmanship of the chancellor of the exchequer, and others. 
The Federation of British Industries has 6,800 individual industrial 
companies and firms and 300 trade associations as members. Huge monopoly-
companies, with up to 100,000 workers, and also firms employing under 100 
workers belong to it. In addition, there are many thousands of firms 
which, as members of the trade associations, are indirectly under the 
Federation's influence. It goes without saying that the owners of the 
huge monopolies run the whole show in the Federation of British Industries.

The Federation's administrative organ is the so-called Grand Council. 
It is elected every three years and has 400 members, two-thirds of whom 
are nominated by the trade associations, and the remainder, by the indi-
vidual firms and companies. The president of the Federation is chairman 
at sessions of the Grand Council; he is elected annually. But usually 
he holds office for two years in succession. The presidents are usually 
directors of the largest industrial companies and trade associations. 
The Grand Council has standing committees on economic policy, foreign 
trade, taxation, fuel and power, transportation, education, technical leg-
islation, and other problems. There is also a Scottish Council and 10 
regional councils, which consist of the representatives of the leading 
industries of the given region. The Grand Council can 'appoint an unlimited 
number of special committees. 
The headquarters staff numbers about 160, and is headed by a Director-
Genpral. There is a General Secretary's department and four directorates: 
economic, technical, home services and information, and overseas. 
, The leading posts in the Federation are held by the representatives 
of "big business" and people closely connected with government circles. 
One of the presidents of the Federation was Sir Harry Pilkington? chair-
man of the huge company, Pilkington Bros. Ltd., and director of many other 
companies, mainly producing glass. Since 1946 Sir Norman Kipping has been 
Director-General of the Federation; during World War II he headed one of 
the divisions of the Ministry of Production and in 1945 was Under-Secretary, 
Board of Trade. In addition to handling the duties of Director-General, 
Kipping is also a member of the British Productivity Council, the Dollar 
Exports Council, and a number of other governmental committees. 
William Edwards is Home Services and Information Director at the 
Federation's headquarters. He worked for a long time on the boards of 
railroad companies, and during World War II held responsible posts in the 
ministries of supply and production. After the war Edwards was in the 
Board of Trade, and also headed the British Information Service in the 
US. Douglas Walker, who formerly worked in the British Foreign Office has 
been General Secretary of the Federation since 1921. 
All the Federation's activity, controlled and managed by the large 
industrial, commercial and financial magnates, is directed toward protect-
ing and securing the interests of the British monopolies. The Federation 
came out actively against the British workers during the railroad strikes 
in 1919, during the lockout of miners in 1921, and during the general 
strike which took place in Great Britain in 1926. An official report 
published by the Federation in May 1926 stated that "upon announcement of 
the general strike, the Federation of British Industries placed its 
organization at the service of the government." The government thanked 
the Federation for its assistance in suppressing the strike in a special 
message.

The Federation of British Industries cooperates closely with other 
British associations and unions of capitalists. One of these associations 
is the British Employers' Confederation. It covers 62 British industries 
which employ over 70 percent of the workers. The Confederation's basic 
task is to oppose collectively the demands for improvement in the condi-
tions of the workers. 
Another British association with which the Federation of British 
Industries maintains close contact is the National Union of Manufacturers. 
This union unites 5,500 firms and 72 trade associations. It unites and 
controls mainly small and average-size firms. 
The Federation of British Industries, the British Employers' Confed-
eration, the National Union of Manufacturers, and also the Association of 
British Chambers of Commerce, the British Trades Union Congress and the 
administrations of the nationalized British industries comprise the so-
called British Productivity Council which deals with the intensification 
of labor in British factories and plants. Because of its colossal eco-
nomic power and great political influence, the Federation of British 
Industries holds a dominating position among these organizations. 
There are special subsidiary organizations to disseminate propaganda 
among the workers at the order of the Federation. These are the Economic 
League and a company called "Aims of Industry." Each year they spend 
about a quarter of a million pounds of sterling to convince the British 
workers to work harder and obtain less. The aims of the Economic League 
are: "to fight steadfastly against all detrimental movements.., to en-
courage free ownership.., to fight against further nationalization." 
Thirty of the 40 persons comprising the League's Council are directors 
of 190 companies. Here are represented huge steel mills, machine manu-
facturing monopolies, insurance companies, four of the "Big Five" British 
banks, etc. The Vice-President of the League is Lord McGowan, who was a 
member of the Anglo-German Fellowship in the 1930's and who was personally 
received by Hitler. Two other prominent members of the Council of the 
Economic League are Viscount Runciman and Sir HarryBrittdin, who also be-
longed to the Anglo-German Fellowship. 
The company called "Aims of Industry," states that it strives to 
give "continuous and well-rounded" information to "industrial workers and 
the public on the share which free ownership has in the well-being of the 
nation." According to this organization's statistics, 500 newspapers and 
magazines utilized materials it had prepared during 1952. 
The members of this company's council are directors or hold other 
high posts in 393 industrial and financial companies. The president of 
the company is Lord Lyle, the British "sugar king" and former member of 
the Anglo-German Fellowship.

Why do the British capitalists need to establish special "owners" 
propaganda organizations at a time when, even without this, the whole 
British propaganda machine, including the press, the radio, movies and 
the staffs of the bourgeois parties, is working for them? An answer to 
this question can be? found in a British pamphlet, The Danger Signal. 
" ...The organized efforts of industry," it states, "if they are well 
directed, will be more effective than the efforts of the political par-
ties, since industry and non-political educational organizations which 
speak for industry have better access to the masses of workers and can 
treat them with less prejudice." 
The Federation of British Industries has always been on guard for 
the interests of the British capitalists. At the end of World War II 
the Federation sent a memorandum to the Board of Trade demanding that 
the Government relinquish even the quite moderate control over industry 
which it held during the war. The memorandum stated that the Government 
must outline only the basic plan for the national economic policy, giving 
the trade and industrial associations true control over this policy. 
After the war the Federation of British Industries repeatedly sub-
mitted official demands to the government concerning the granting of new 
privileges to the manufacturers at the expense of the people. Thus, in 
January 1947, the Federation demanded a considerable reduction in direct 
taxes of the Exchequer, especially in taxes on profits, even if this 
hindered the balancing of the British budget. 
The government carried out this demand without objection. The 
government was careful to see that the measures they implement conformed 
with the interests of the organizations of big British capital. In March 
1948 the Chancellor of the Exchequer sent the Federation of British 
Industries and some other big capital associations a letter submitting 
the government's future financial and economic policy for approval by the 
manufacturers. The Federation coldly replied to the Chancellor that his 
policy of "freezing prices, wages and profits," was only a partial and 
temporary solution to the problem of inflation in Great Britain and was 
"in principle quite unsatisfactory." The Federation outlined its own 
much stricter program. Three days had not gone by when the Chancellor of 
the Exchequer, in a servile letter addressed to the leaders of the Federa-
tion of British Industries and other interested organizations, answered 
that their proposals were a good basis for further measures which "will 
be of great importance for the country if they are implemented in a 
spirit of cooperation." 
The demands of the Federation of British Industries always have a 
strongly pronounced class character. They are directed toward making 
the owners and bankers wealthier. Before submitting the regular budget 
to Parliament, the British government, either Conservative or Labour,

Approved For Release 2001/07/28 : CIA-RDP65-00756R000300270001-9 
usually receives and carefully studies a budget memorandum from the 
Federation of British Industries. After considering the Federation's 
detailed demands, the government submits the budget to Parliament. 
The type of demands which are made to the Government can be seen, 
for example, in a memorandum submitted by the Federation to the Chancellor 
of the Exchequer in March 1951. Here is what the big shots of British 
industry demanded: a 300 million pounds sterling reduction in government 
expenditures for local self-government, mainly for housing construction; 
"savings" of 300 million pounds sterling for social measures; abolition 
of taxes on company profits; reductions in direct taxes and increases in 
indirect taxes such as taxes on consumer goods, which fall mainly on the 
workers. 
In the middle of July 1956 the Federation of British Industries, 
the British Employers' Confederation, the National Union of Manufacturers, 
and the Association of British Chambers of Commerce set forth, in a joint 
declaration, the principles on which government's industrial and financial 
policy should be based. Two weeks later, Prime Minister Eden called a 
meeting attended by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of Labor 
and National Service, and also representatives of the Federation of 
British Industries, the British Trades Union Congress, the British Employ-
ers' Confederation and representatives of the nationalized industries. A 
Government announcement, published after the meeting, reflected the prin-
ciples of the British capitalists exactly. 
A great number of such examples could be given. They all show that 
the Federation of British Industries, as an organization of exploiters, 
is only concerned with its egotistical, strictly class interests. The 
drive to obtain maximum profits, the consolidation of its ruling posi-
tion within the country, and the strengthening of British monopolies 
abroad - these are the basic motives underlying all its activity. 
The Federation of British Industries has broad international con-
nections. It is a member of the Council of European Industrial Federa-
tions and is represented in the International Chamber of Commerce. The 
Federation has played a leading role in the formation and activities of 
the Anglo-American Council on Productivity, which had the basic purpose 
of applying American sweatshop production methods in Great Britain. The 
Federation has representatives and correspondents in more than 100 cities 
throughout the world, including all the large capitalist countries. The 
Federation has a special council concerned with promoting British ex-
ports to the dollar area. This Council's work is actively supported by 
the government. High-level officials in government departments attend 
its meetings.

The activity of the Federation of British Industries in the interna-
tional arena serves the expansionist aims of the British monopolists. In 
the interests of obtaining maximum profits, the individual companies be-
longing to the Federation and the Federation as a whole undertake all 
sorts of schemes, unconcernedly waiving the national interests of their 
people. A clear example of this activity is the Federation's agreement 
of March 1939 with the German Reichsgruppe Industrie. Striving at all 
costs to bring Germany and the Soviet Union into conflict, the British 
ruling circles decided to support the Munich political agreement with an 
"economic Munich." With this purpose, negotiations were organized in 
Dusseldorf between the Federation of British Industries and the German 
Reichsgruppe Industrie, The British President of the Board of Trade, 
speaking in Parliament, announced that these negotiations were going on 
with "the full knowledge and approval of His Majesty's Government," and 
expressed hope for their success. 
* * * 
The Federation of British Industries implements its policy and influ-
ences the various governmental, administrative and public organizations 
through its numerous representatives, henchmen and supporters in these 
organizations. 
Thirty-four ministers of the 1954 Conservative Government, before 
entering the government were directors of a total of 102 corporations, 
companies and banks. Although a minister must formally leave his posi-
tion of director after taking a government position, actually his con-
nections with the company do not stop. He keeps his shares in this 
company and, after retiring, can again resume his post of director. 
Let us examine the composition of the last two Conservative govern-
ments. Their members had been directors of large industrial and financial 
monopolies. Former Prime Minister Eden was director of the Westminster 
Bank; a company mining copper and sulfur in Spain, the Rio Tinto Company; 
and a large insurance company, - Phoenix Assurance, which has shares in 17 
other insurance companies. The present Prime Minister, Macmillan, was 
director of three companies, including the largest publishers in England, 
Macmillan and Company. Lord Privy Seal Butler is the former director of 
the largest company producing synthetic yarn and fabric, Courtaulds, 
which owns huge enterprises in Canada, the Union of South Africa, Spain 
and Australia as well as in Great Britain. Lord President of the Council 
Salisbury was director of the Westminster Bank and of an insurance com-
pany. Minister Duncan Sandys was formerly director of three companies 
mining gold in West Africa. The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and 
Food, Heathcoat Amory, was formerly director of Lloyds Bank and the 
family firm, John Heathcoat and Co. This list could be continued. 
According to data in John Gollan's book, The British Political  
System, directors of 28 powerful trusts held 10 Government posts, in-
cluding:--the Foreign Secretary, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the

Minister of Materials, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the 
Secretary of State for Air, Minister of State Board of Trade,and the 
Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation. Eighty-eight of the directors 
of these trusts are members of Parliament. "They control the whole gov-
ernment apparatus," states Gollan. "Five of these directors are members 
of the Advisory Committee of the Exports Credit Guarantee Department; 
the chairmanship and three seats on the Board of the Capital Issues Com-
mittee belong to the trusts; they have the chairmanship of the Public 
Works Loan Board, four seats in the Colonial Development Corporation, the 
chairmanship of the Wheat Commission, the chairmanship of the National 
Research Development Corporation; they have several members also on the 
Advisory Council of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. 
"They have two seats on the Board of the British Overseas Airways 
Corporation and the Vice-Presidency of the Air Transport Advisory. Council, 
the chairmanship and two governorships in the British Broadcasting Corpo-
ration, and the Chairmanship of The Times. They hold seven positions in 
the Royal Household: Lord Chamberlain, Lord Steward, Master of the Horse, 
three Lords in Waiting, and one member of the Corps of Gentlemen at Arms. 
? "The directors hold the following military titles: Army one 
Field Marshal, one General, one Brigadier General, one Lieutenant General, 
two Major-Generals, and six Colonels; Air---one Marshal of the Air Force, 
one Air Chief Marshal, and one Air Commodore; Navy---one Admiral of the 
Fleet." (J. Gollan, The British Political System, p 13) 
Many members of the Government and representatives of business cir-
cles are closely interconnected by family relationships. Former Prime 
Minister Eden is married to one of Churchill's nieces. Minister of 
Defence Sandys and Conservative Member of Parliament Soames are related 
by blood to Churchill. And there are other examples. Former Secretary 
of State for Scotland Stuart married into the family of the Duke of 
Devonshire. Former Lord President of the Council Salisbury is also con-
nected with this family. Former Minister of Defense Monckton was married 
to Salisbury's first cousin. Secretary of State for Commonwealth Rela-
tions Lord Home has family connections with the Conservative members of 
Parliament, Viscount Lambton and Major Anstruther-Gray. 
This interweaving of connections includes the whole top level of 
the British ruling class. The government, Parliament, the Royal Palace 
and the Headquarters of the Federation of British Industries are con-
nected by close class, business and blood ties. 
?War and the armaments race bring the capitalists especially great 
profits. "The golden rain," wrote V. I. Lenin, "flows directly into 
the pockets of the bourgeois politicians, who make up a closely knit 
international gang, instigating the peoples to competition in armaments..." 
(V. I. Lenin, Works, Volume 19, p 83)

Here are the facts. During World War II the profits of the British 
companies grew by 81 percent. Total profits of 18,100 million pounds 
Sterling were made by the British capitalists between 1939 and 1945. In 
other words, during the seven years, the owners made more than 1,000 
pounds sterling from the exploitation of each worker (there are 17 mil-
lion workers in Great Britain). Between 1939 and 1945 the British Govern-
ment spent 22,846 million pounds sterling for military purposes. Of this 
amount, more than 900 million pounds was spent to construct and equip war 
indAstry. The majority of the war plants, built with the people's money, 
were sold to the big monopolies after the war for almost nothing. 
After World War II the British ruling circles did not plan to reor-
ganize the economy on a peace-time basis. They wished to maintain, with 
the assistance of the armaments race, the high profit rate which they 
had during the war. One of the influential city organs, the Economist  
magazine, wrote frankly in 1950: It would be a mistake to say that 
Great Britain now intends to return to a war economy, since she has 
actually never departed from the economy of the last war." Under the 
banner of preparation for "defense" from an imaginary "danger", allegedly 
from the Soviet Union, the militarization of the economy continues; in-
dustry has received war orders and new types of arms have been created. 
The government has not spared government funds for these purposes, funds 
collected from the population as taxes. During the first four years 
after World War II, war expenditures by theExchequerwere 4 billion 
pounds sterling, more than five times as much as expenditures during the 
four years before the war. 
The Federation of British Industries is one of the main inspirers 
and organizers of the campaign to fan war hysteria and to force a con-
version of the British economy to a wartime basis. The henchmen of the 
British monopolies in the governmental departments and in Parliament 
understand what is required of them. They zealously try to carry out 
the wishes of their masters. In August 1950 the Minister of Economic 
Affairs held a special meeting with representatives of the Federation 
of British Industries and the British Employers' Confederation and with 
the majority of the members of the General Council of the British Trades 
Union Congress; they discussed the problem of the effect of the govern-
ment rearmament program on industry. After this meeting the militariza-
tion of the British economy developed on a wide scale. 
In 1951 the British Government adopted a gigantic armaments program. 
Government military expenditures were first set at 3.6 billion pounds 
sterling for the following three years, but then were increased to 4.7 
billion pounds sterling. A government review of the economic outlook for 
1951 stated: "Implementation of the greatly expanded and accelerated 
armaments program has now become the primary aim of the government's 
economic policy."

The magnates of British big capital and their cohorts in the govern-
ment did not conceal the fact that they intended to carry out the military 
economic program at the expense of the workers. "We must cover the - 
greater part of the rearmament expenditures," frankly states the economic 
review, "by putting off for some time (1) an increase in the standard of 
living and even by reducing the present level." 
Great Britain is spending billions of pounds sterling on war prepara-
tions. These huge funds, collected from the British people, are moving 
into the pockets of the armament factory owners as profits. In 19500 
when war began in Korea, the profits of 877 companies publishing reports 
increased by 27 percent over the preceding year. Among them, the profits 
of 31 chemical companies increased by 52 percent, and those of 29 engine 
and aircraft companies increased by 55 percent. Income of rubber-process-
ing companies increased by 250 percent. 
The gross profits of three of the largest concerns in the Federation 
of British Industries increased by unprecedented amounts between 1949 and 
1953. Profits of the Unilever Trade and Industrial Syndicate increased 
by 79 percent; those of the Royal Dutch Shell Petroleum concern increased 
by 84 percent; and those of the gigantic chemical association, Imperial 
Chemical Industries, increased by 104 percent. The head of the large 
Hawker Siddeley Aircraft Company, which belongs to the Federation, admitted 
that profits increased, during one year alone by 38.4 percent. 
The largest British war industry monopoly, Vickers-Armstrong, Ltd., 
also a member of the Federation of British Industries, is earning huge 
profits. It manufactures and delivers warships, planes, tanks, submarines, 
instruments, ammunition, and other armaments and supplies. It has enter-
prises in almost all the heavy industries: shipbuilding, machinery, fer-
rous metallurgy, coal, petroleum, etc. This company has built war plants 
not only in Great Britain, but also in other countries such as Spain, 
Italy, Japan, and Turkey. Vickers-Armstrong Ltd. has branches, represen-
tatives and agents in many countries. 
These monopolies do not scruple to use any means to obtain maximum 
profits. On the eve of World War I, the Vickers agent in Japan, who was 
trying to get an order for building a warship, admitted that he had 
bribed government officials. In 1933 the Vickers representative was ex-
pelled from Turkey. He was charged with bribery and espionage. In the 
same year this firm's agents in the Soviet Union were convicted of sabo-
tage and espionage. 
The representatives of the Vickers-Armstrong concern have their 
cohorts in the Government, and the Government sends representatives, 
'especially Military personnel, to holdleading posts in the concern. Thus, 
the Vickers representatives, Anderson and Craven, were appointed as Minister

of Defense and as Industrial Advisor to the Minister of Production. 
Lieutenant General Weeks, who was chief of the Imperial General Staff 
during the war, now represents the concern. Among the Vickers-Armstrong 
directors are a major-geterall a colonel and a lieutenant-colonel. 
Vicker's profits in 1953 reached 9.5 million pounds sterling. 
The monopolies which are growing rich in the armaments race fre-
quently use government funds to expand their enterprises. The following 
announcement by the president of the West, Keen and Nettlefolds Company 
illustrates this: "We were able to cooperate with the government depart-
ments in the campaign for rearmament. This applies not only to production 
capacities in the existing plants and to existing equipment, but in some 
cases also to considerable programs undertaken at the request of the 
government and mainly at its expenses", i.e., at the expense of the 
British taxpayer. 
The greediness of the capitalist beasts of prey in their unrestrained 
striving for high profits know no limit. The imperialists are ready to 
trade with the lives of their compatriots in the pursuit of profits. 
They do not even consider it always necessary to conceal this from the 
public. Thus, one of the Conservative members of Parliament, a certain 
Fletcher, director of a firm dealing in rubber, announced one time: "I 
must admit that I have commercial interests in many parts of the Far East, 
especially in Indo-China... It is possible that some capital investments 
on our part, visible capital investments in the form of troops and arms, 
such as America is making in Indo-China, could result in good dividends." 
It is not surprising therefore, that the monopolists and stock bro-
kers do not wish the establishment of normal relations between governments 
or that they fear a lessening of international tension. When negotiations 
to stop military operations in Korea began, the organ of the London City 
financial bosses, Stock Exchange Gazette, wrote anxiously: "Peace presents 
no less serious problems than war... Defense production in the United 
States and Great Britain, which, to a considerable degree has been ad-
justed to the national production efforts, cannot be stopped abruptly." 
In 1955 Great Britain spent almost 10 times as much for military 
purposes than she spent before World War II. Military appropriations 
comprised 33 percent of the 1955-1956 budget. This brought the arms 
manufacturers more profits, even higher than during the previous years. 
It was not for nothing that Strachey, of the Labour Party, during the 
debate in the House of Commons on 2 March 1955 on armament, declared that 
"The White Paper (i.e., official plans - P. S.) on defense and the planned 
appropriations, as formerly, is written by the owners of the war plants 
and by big capital." There is no reason not to believe Strachey's state-
ment. Who would know better than Strachey that this was correct; he was 
Secretary of State for War in Attlee's Government.

Recently work on the production of atomic and hydrogen armaments 
caused much trading in stocks in monopolist circles. This new branch of 
the war industry promises colossal profits for them. Since 1945 more 
than 100 million pounds sterling have already been spent on the production 
of atomic bombs. Now measures are being implemented to expand the produc-
tion of mass annihilation weapons. According to the newspaper, Financial  
Times, 180 British firms were working in the atomic energy field in 1955 
and some of them are already making deliveries. 
A special state corporation was established to produce atomic arms. 
This corporation is headed by the same representatives of big capital who 
belong to the Federation of British Industries. Plowden, who headed the 
Ministry of Aircraft Production during the war and was director of Commer-
cial Union Assurance Company and British Aluminium Co. Ltd., was appointed 
President of this corporation. The corporation's board includes such big 
business men as Stedeford, the president of Tube Investments, Ltd. Gov-
ernmental control over the corporation's activity was assigned to Lord 
Salisbury, former director of the Westminster Bank, i.e., again a repre-
sentative of the Federation of British Industries, 
The British Government's decision to produce hydrogen bombs in 
Great Britain aroused general indignation and criticism among great num-
bers of the English people. The Daily Worker printed a number of state-
ments by prominent British public and scientific figures relating to this 
decision. Dr. Hewlett Johnson, the Archbishop of Canterbury, said: 
"Production of the hydrogen bomb in England cannot lead to peace. It is 
suicide." Nobel prize winner, Dr. SyngeD, transliterated from Russian] 
stated the opinion that "the announcement in the White Paper in no way 
promotes peace. Without a doubt the time has come for all countries to 
outlaw the hydrogen bomb." Another Nobel prize winner, former General 
Director of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, Lord Boyd Orr, 
shares this opinion: "All countries must find ways not only to outlaw 
the bomb, but also to outlaw war, in order to ensure security." 
The armaments race is a heavy burden for the British workers. In 
1954 per capita taxes increased by more than 12 percent over 1950. 
Prices of food, clothing and fuel are rising steadily and the costs of 
public services and all types of transportation are growing. During 10 
postwar years the food price index grew 50-150 percent. According to 
official data, the cost of living in Great Britain in January l95 was 
almost 50 percent greater than in 1947. 
The British people are conducting a stubborn fight against the at-
tack by the capitalists on their vital rights and against preparations 
for a,new war. The number of strikes in Great Britain increased from 
2,424 in 1955 to 2,643 in 1956. This year was marked by the strike of 
locomotive engineers and stokers, which, according to the British press, 
was the most serious strike since the 1926 general strike. Under great

pressure from the organized laboring class, the Federation of British 
Industries and the British Employers' Confederation have been compelled, 
in a number of cases, to make concessions to the strikers and to agree to 
the workers' most urgent demands. This shows the workers that despite 
all the power of the monopolies and the strength of the government ma-
chine of the capitalists, despite the fact that they have a vast amount 
of capital and have the army and police at their disposal, despite all 
this, the British laboring class is many times stronger than the capital-
ists when it acts in a fraternal, cohesive and organized fashion. 
The manufacturers, bankers, merchants, stock brokers and retired 
generals, all those who sit on the Grand Council of the Federation of 
British Industries, cannot help but feel that capitalism's position is 
weakening with every day. Militarization of the economy and its one-
sided military development cannot save the capitalist economy from crises; 
it only leads to the development of even deeper contradictions. 
...Luring recent years, despite the opposition of the aggressive 
forces, the peoples have succeeded in having international tension some-
what lessened. Increasingly favorable prospects have been created for 
the consolidation of universal peace. However, in capitalist countries 
furious activity has developed in the aggressive circles which fear a 
reduction of tension in relations among states and are interested in 
continuing the armaments race and in becoming wealthier through war 
orders. They are stubbornly opposing the people's demands to reduce 
armaments and the armed forces and to outlaw atomic and hydrogen weapons. 
They do not even hesitate, as events in the Near East showed, to unleash 
wars. 
The activity of the Federation of British Industries clearly shows 
this role of the oligarchy of British financial capital, which is harm-
ful to peace and to the interests of the workers.

The Intelligence Service Man A. Leonidov 
The following appears in the British biographical manual: General 
Lord Ismay, Baron, born in 18870 was Secretary General of the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization and Vice-Chairman of the North Atlantic 
Council, former Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, former 
Chief of Staff to British Viceroy in India, chief of Churchill's personal 
staff during World War II, former Secretary of the Committee of Imperial 
Defense. 
The ordinary Londoner can hardly say more than two or three words 
about this Lord; little is written about him. 
What kind of person is this 70-year old General, whose name became 
known to the general public only comparatively recently although he plays 
a not =important role in Great Britain's international affairs and in 
the military preparations of the Western powers? 
? This question can be answered by four words: the Intelligence 
Serviceman. 
Ismay is one of the chief leaders of this secret military and politi-
cal organization which, as an important weapon of British big capital, 
stands invisibly behind every British Government - Conservative, Labour 
or Liberal. Ismay came from the womb of ancient British imperialism, 
which formerly imposed its will on the capitalist world. This is his 
strength and his weakness. 
Lord Ismay is known as a quiet, equable, almost imperturbable man. 
He seldom raises his voice. But when, with a somewhat ironic expression, 
he does this, his British colleagues, as a rule, become silent. He does 
not need to shout or argue. He speaks a few words and they obey him. 
Ismay is not a talented orator; he does not need to be. He never speaks 
at party meetings. For him, all three bourgeois British parties are 
political agents of the ruling class; each has its time and place. He 
dines with a Conservative noble, smiles at a Liberal Minister, and affably, 
although somewhat arrogantly, greets the gentlemen from the Right Labour 
bench. All these people are his friends allies, and sometimes his direct 
assistants. 
"If you know General Ismay," wrote a correspondent of the Reuters 
Agency in February 1945, "then you cannot be surprised by the fact that 
he is a prominent figure even among the prominent statesmen of the world. 
He is actually a considerable personality... Considering General Ismay's 
prominent situation, it should be noted that he has made an art of the 
- 195 -

Approved For Release 2001/07/28 : CIA-RDP65-00756R000300270001-9 
ability to make himself inconspicuous. In the very best society he stands 
out because of his splendid build, the carriage of a good sportsman and a 
typical professional British soldier... At the same time the General 
avoids attracting attention and does not like publicity." 
Ismay has never voted in Parliament; this would be a sheer waste of 
time. For him Parliament is a place for chattering, where the orators - 
Conservatives, Liberals, Labourites, gentlemen in suits or dinner jackets - 
make speeches for the people from previously harmonized notes. 
The people, for Ismay, are only raw material, a gray mass of people 
obligated, in his opinion, to do one of two things: to work or to fight; 
to gain profits for the gentlemen or to die in their interests. The mil-
lions of British people - men and women loving life, peace, culture, their 
children, and their future - according to Ismay are either a certain 
amount of war material, living machines for operating dead machines - 
rifles, cannons, planes and battleships of the British Empire, or they 
are a mass of production material, muscular power for the machine tools 
which are owned by the joint-stock companies of the British Empire. 
Everything is quite simple. In the third place, for Ismay the people are 
an explosive political material dangerous to the British Empire, millions 
of friends of peace and progress who must be held in check by steel 
gloves. Here, of course, special watchfulness is required, and if neces-
sary, ruthlessness. 
This is the whole philosophy of British domestic policy from the 
point of view of General Lord Ismay. And its foreign policy, according 
to his conception, consists of one principal point, for which his organi-
zation exists: come what may and at any price, stop the decline of 
British imperialism, revive it and make it once again the master of the 
world as it was when the future General and Baron Ismay was born. 
II 
The father of the ?General-Baron, Sir Stanley Ismay, was General 
Inspector of Police and Prisons in one of the Indian provinces. He 
wrote a book, Rules for Supervising and Managiqg  Prisons in the Central 
Province, a "profound" work which hundreds of English administrators and 
rulers in India studied. He was one of those masters of British police 
business of whom the troubadour of British imperialism, Kipling, sang in 
the novel, "Kim," Here are to be found the roots of his son's career. 
Later Sir Stanley Ismay rose to the rank of Governor of one of the 
Indian provinces and member of the Legislative Council under the English 
Viceroy. 
At that time India was not only the heart of the British Empire, 
but also the higher school for British politicians, officials and military 
personnel. Here they learned to command, to rob, to intrigue and to exe-
cute people; they studied at the very "highest", "academic" level. It 
would not be an exaggeration to say that British industrial and financial 
- 196 -

Approved For Release 2001/07/28 : CIA-RDP65-00756R000300270001-9 
capitalism was built on the bones of the Indian peasants. But it is also 
true that the reactionary British militarists of the 20th century grew, 
above all, out of the old Anglo-Indian Army and that the most experienced 
personnel of the Intelligence Service "perfected themselves" in India. 
Over the course of two centuries, British capital pumped great funds, 
billion after billion, out of this huge country, almost equal in area and 
population to the European mainland. Select cadres of privileged British 
officers and officials were formed, educated and tempered here. In prac-
tice it meant more to be the governor of a large Indian province than to 
be a British Minister; it meant more to be a colonel in the Anglo-Indian 
Army than to be a general in a provincial English city. 
According to a plan formulated at the end of the last century by the 
City and the Foreign Office, called the "Curzon plan" in enlightened cir-
cles, India was to become the center of an even greater British Empire in 
Asia. It was intended to join to this Empire Persia and Afghanistan in 
the West; Tibet, Sinkiang and Turkestan in the North; and the whole of 
Southern China, at least to the Yangtse River, in the East. It was also 
intended to attach the British domains in Burma, Malaya and Arabia to it. 
Such a British super-empire, planned in London, comprising the whole 
fertile south of Asia, bounded by British Africa from the Cape to Cairo 
on the one hand, and by Australia on the other hand, gripping the whole 
area from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean in a steel semicircle, was 
intended by its authors to make the world domination of British capitalism 
permanent rapidly reducing all the remaining great powers to the situation 
of second-rate and dependent states. 
British diplomacy worked for decades to realize this plan. Its 
chief weapon, in addition to the British fleet which ruled the world sea 
routes, was the tactic of constantly setting one power against another, 
in order to keep the keys of international politics in British hands. It 
was intended to use the Anglo-Indian Army and Intelligence Service not 
only to keep the 400 million Indian people obedient, but also to sub-
jugate the neighboring Asiastic countries. 
Ismay devoted the first half of his life completely to the "Curzon 
Plan." Then, it is true, he was only one of many; he was attending 
school. In 1908 this son of the great Anglo-Indian policeman and prison 
keeper became an officer in a cavalry regiment quartered in the North-
West Frontier region of India. This was an extremely vital section of 
the British position - from here they annually attacked the neighboring 
Moslem tribes, burning village after village and hanging thousands of 
people. 
Ismay watched, learned and gained It Even in those years, 
in his early youth, he absorbed the feeling which was "quite obligatory" 
for each guardian of British imperialism in the East, the feeling of scorn 
-197-

Approved For Release 2001/07/28 : CIA-RDP65-00756R000300270001-9 
for the "colored man," the slave of the British sahib (white lord). Later, 
when the socialist revolution burst out in Russia, this feeling of Ismay's 
merged with a hatred for socialist Russia, which became a beacon for all 
the Asian workers who did not wish to serve the sahibs any longer. The 
pure-blooded Sahib, Ismay, remembered this fact for his whole life. Thus 
his political personality was finally set. 
He was not a dashing cavalry warrior. Ismay early showed that he was 
a worthy son of his father and that his chief strength was the art of 
secret political intrigue. This was appreciated by his superiors. They 
did not permit him to participate in World War I in Europe and sent him 
for further training to the British African Colony of Somaliland where, 
for six years, he hunted down and persecuted the impoverished blacks who 
rebelled against their British masters. His African experience supple-
mented his practice in Asia. In 1923 Ismay was already Assistant Quarter-
master General of the Anglo-Indian Army. Three years later, at the age of 
39, already with the rank of Major, he was called to London. His training 
was complete. The Center of the Intelligence Service needed Ismay for 
"big" things. 
III 
In 1904 the whole secret system of administering British policy was 
reorganized. At the initiative of Prime Minister Balfour and the big 
financier, Lord Asher, the Committee of Imperial Defense was established; 
to a considerable degree it actually replaced the government but was free 
of any responsibility to Parliament. 
Officially, this Committee, with the rights of a consultative body 
to the government, was entrusted with the long-term planning of British 
foreign and military policy. In reality, decisions were made by its 
advisors and planners: their decrees were binding on the whole govern-
ment apparatus, although the public and even the House of Commons was not 
informed of them. Who belonged to the Committee? The Prime Minister, 
some other ministers, the chiefs of staff of the Army and Navy (later 
also of Air), the chief official of the treasury, heading the civil ad-
ministration. The permanent secretary of the Committee and also the heads 
of all divisions were almost all unknown Intelligence Service personnel. 
British governments came and went. Conservatives replaced Liberals 
and Liberals, Conservatives; later the Liberals were replaced by Labour-
ites. But the permanent officials of the Committee of Imperial Defense 
remained. Each new government presented its special, new program. And 
each "new" program was carried out by the same people. 
For 27 years, from 1912 to 1938, the Secretary of the Committee of 
Imperial Defense was Colonel Maurice Hankey. His name almost never ap-
peared in the newspapers. The ordinary Englishman simply did not know 
about him. Hankey did not even obtain the rank of general. He came into 
the Committee of Imperial Defense directly from the Naval Intelligence 
-198-
Approved For Release 2001/07/28 : CIA-RDP65-00756R000300270001-9 
Approved For Release 2001/07/28 : CIA-RDP65-00756R000300270001-9 
Department. Hanky was not only Secretary of the Committee; he combined 
this position with the position of Secretary of the Council of Ministers 
and with the rank of clerk of the King's Privy Council. He attended 
almost all international and imperial conferences as the Secretary of the 
British delegation. Balfour, Campbell-Bannerman, Asquith, Lloyd George, 
Baldwin, MacDonald, and Chamberlain sat in the House of Commons as British 
Prime Ministers, gave noisy speeches, denounced each other, won elections, 
suffered defeats and retired. Little Colonel Hankey quietly sat in his 
place in the restricted Committee and acted without fearing the House of 
Commons, the House of Lords or the voters. That was the heart of the 
matter. 
The establishment of the Committee of Imperial Defense was one of 
the "small" changes in the British "democratic" structure brought about 
by capital, fearing the growth of the mass worker movement. No matter 
who headed the British "democracy" externally, all those people from the 
City and the Intelligence Service always ruled it from within. 
In 1926 Colonel Hanky called in a new assistant from India, Major 
Ismay. The future Lord worked on the Committee of Imperial Defense for 
15 years, under the Conservatives, Baldwin, Chamberlain and Churchill, 
and the Labourites, MacDonald and Attlee. During the entire period from 
1926 to 1946 he was assigned elsewhere only twice. In 1931 he was ap-
pointed Military Secretary to the Viceroy of India, Lord Wellington, to 
help him quell the rising national liberation movement in India, Ismay 
was already a specialist in this matter. The sahibs started making mass 
arrests and raids. They established an unbearable regime in India. Al-
most all the leaders of the national movement, headed by Mahatma Gandhi, 
were thrown into prison. The police shot people at demonstrations, set 
Moslem against Hindu and Hindu against Moslem. Thinking that he had com-
pleted his task and had the Indian people intimidated for the next few 
decades, Ismay returned to London and immediately, already a Colonels 
received new, even more important instructions. In 1933, during the 
time that Hitler was coming to power in Germany, Ismay was appointed 
Chief of the Eastern Department of the British Intelligence Service. 
This was the most important division of the Intelligence Service. 
Its sphere of action included not only India, the Far East, and the 
Near East, but also the Soviet Union, Poland and the Baltic area. The 
main task of the chief of this division was the secret encirclement of 
the Soviet Union and subversive work on its very territory. Ismay earned 
the nickname of "Pug" for this work. He had a whole army of agents 
operating under widely differing masks from diplomats, journalists and 
"business men" to "engineers" and Catholic priests. "Pugs" secret agents 
operated in the capitals of all the states bordering the USSR, and were 
either included directly on the embassy staffs or appeared as representa-
tives of business firms, charitable organizations or press bureaus.

The Colonel of the British Colonial Army in India transferred his 
methods to Europe, utilizing local conditions. In India he worked with 
horse herders, dancers and police disguised as fakirs; here he bribed 
false "labor leaders" and members of parliament. It was all one and the 
same to him; Ismay is not a romanticist. It was under him and his 
closest successors that the Eastern Division of the Intelligence Service 
worked out the full ramifications of that international system of secret 
sabotage against the socialist camp which exists to this very day. 
In 1936 Ismay returned to the Committee of Imperial Defense com-
pletely "matured." Now he was no longer assistant, but deputy to Hankey. 
On the eve of the war, in 1939, the little known Colonel Hankey was made 
a Lord and then suddenly appointed a member of Chamberlain's war cabinet. 
The British public was surprised; the initiates smirked. Ismay, a Major 
General by then, replaced his chief in the Committee of Imperial Defense, 
IV 
Even before the war Ismay implemented the policy which he had once 
learned in India in this Committee; he knew nothing else and did not wish 
to know anything else. The main aim of this policy was to strengthen and 
enlarge the empire of British sahibs. Its main enemy was the Soviet 
workers and peasants, 200 million people between the Baltic Sea and the 
Pacific Ocean, who had overthrown their masters and embraced socialism 
as the basis of their life and who were setting an example for the whole 
world. Enemy No. 2 was the colored man, breaking the fetters placed on 
him by white capital, more than a billion people recognizing no empire 
and demanding freedom and independence. 
Working behind the scenes in Chamberlain's government, Ismay con-
centrated all his efforts on creating an international anti-Soviet bloc. 
Along with Hankey he was one of the authors of the Chamberlain plan, to 
entourage Hitler and set him against the Soviet Union. This plan in-
tended to buy the German Fascists, to help them arm, to throw them 
against Moscow, to force the Soviet and German people to make blood run 
in a gigantic battle, and then to seize their riches. It seemed to 
Imlay that Chamberlain's card could not be covered. He already antici-
pated the day when British troops, as "restorers of order" would again 
invade the Caucasus and Soviet Central Asia and remain there permanently. 
Preparing these wild plans, Ismay and his friends failed to notice only 
one thing. By entering into an agreement with Hitler against the Soviet 
Union they pushed Great Britain to the edge of destruction. This became 
clear to the British people, but did not stop Ismay and his friends. 
After the rout of the British Army at Dunkirk, Ismay became Chief 
of Staff to British Ministry of Defence, while remaining essentially 
the head of the Committee of Imperial Defense, which was changed into 
the government's war office.

According to his own statement, his tasks during the war were strategy 
and planning, the organization of military and civil defense, censorship, 
military legislation and the organization of supply. Prime Minister 
Churchill described Ismay's functions at that time somewhat more fully. 
"General Ismay," he stated, "represents me on the Commission of Chiefs of 
General Staffs and is responsible for informing the military command and 
myself on all questions requiring a decision at the top." Many questions 
required a "decision at the top," including basic problems of British 
foreign policy, 
The General always accompanied the Prime Minister, in London, in 
Washington, in Quebec, in Casablanca, and in Cairo. The Prime Minister 
gave a command, Ismay formulated the orders. They called him "Winston's 
Grey Cardinal." It cannot be doubted that the intelligence serviceman 
had his hand in the attempts by the British reactionaries during the last 
years of the war to make a secret agreement with the German Fascists to 
open the Western Front to Anglo-American troops and to keep the Soviet 
Army from entering Germany. 
Ismay forgot nothing. This dry, silent man never deviated from his 
basic intention. Although every Englishman, even including Ismay himself, 
saw clearly that the Soviet Union was helping Great Britain avoid defeat, 
Ismay even then thought only of how to deceive and encircle the Soviet 
Union. His? class nature continued to push him along a path which was 
harmful to the national interests of his country. 
The war ended. The Conservative Government was overthrown. Twelve 
million Britishers voted against the Conservatives. The right-wing 
Labourite, Alexander, became Minister of Defence. This changed nothing 
for Ismay; he remained as Chief of Staff under Alexander. Only after two 
years, having received an urgent assignment, did he abandon this post; 
the Intelligence Service again sent him where he began his career. The 
storm was mounting in India. The Indian workers and peasants were break-
ing their chains and now the British policemen and prison keepers could 
do nothing; it was impossible to seize all the Indians. But it was pos-
sible to try and deceive than, 
Imlay was appointed Chief of Staff to the last British Viceroy in 
India, Lord Mountbatten. He did his business. Along with Mountbatten, 
Ismay conducted a reform in India along the lines of the old rule: 
divide and conquer. The country was divided into two parts. The inten-
tion was to push one aWay from the other. 
Ismay thought that he had won this time as he had won during his 
mission to India in 1931-1933. It was even intended that he become 
Viceroy in India after Mountbatten. But he lost. Despite the "skillful" 
division of India, the British colonial system in Asia after World War II 
was broken forever. The powerful growth of the national liberation

movement among the peoples of Asia negated all the plans of the old intel-
ligence worker. Now nothing could force the ordinary Indian worker or 
peasant to be afraid of the likes of Ismay, still mentally living in the 
age of Kipling. India, as other countries on this continent, went its own 
way. A new system of independent Asiatic peoples developed where the 
colonizers formerly ruled. The political agents of the Intelligence 
Service, both with and without masks, still tried to postpone the outcome. 
But their card was covered. 
Ismay did not become the Viceroy of India, and returned to London. 
The Labour Government made him a Lord in 1947. He was then 60 years old. 
The Intelligence Service offered him a temporary rest. Ismay accepted 
the offer - it was necessary to collect his forces. He has been in re-
tirement for four years, supported by those whom the Intelligence Service 
actually serves, the British monopolies. 
V 
Immediately after World War II it was possible to observe a remark-
able event in Great Britain; almost all the well-known generals and field 
marshalls who had retired, one after the other became bankers, manufactur-
ers, and big merchants. The day after taking off their uniforms, they sat 
on the boards of some joint stock company, controlling hundreds of mil-
lions of pounds sterling. 
The Chief of the Imperial General Staff and Commander-in-Chief of 
British Land Forces, Field-Marshal Lord Alanbrooke became Director of the 
Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. and of the largest bank in the country, the Midland 
Bank, The Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, Admiral 
Cunningham, was elected Chairman of the Board of the Iraq Oil Co.; the 
Commander-inChief of Air Forces, Air Marshal Lord Portal, became Director 
of Barclay's Bank and of the British branch of the Ford Company, The 
Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army, Field-Marshal Auchinleck was ap-
pointed Director of the Anglo-Indian Grindlay's Bank; the Assistant Chief 
of the Imperial General Staff, General Weeks, obtained the post of Chair-
man of the Board of Vickers, that war industry monopoly; Chief Air Marshal 
Salmond became Director of the Shell Oil Trust. Ismay's predecessor as 
Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defense, the aging Lord Hankey, 
obtained the posts of Director of the Suez Canal Company, the Nile 
Insurance Company in Cairo, and the Jorehaut Tea Company in India. 
This list could fill more than one page. The highest military 
caste of the British Empire has quite openly merged with the highest 
plutocratic aristocracy, on which it depended fully while still in active 
service. Now, having retired, the members of this cast have not been shy 
about taking off their masks. The organizers of war have shown themselves 
to be the companions of the merchants in oil, automobiles, currency, arti-
ficial silk, tea, whatever is convenient.

Ismay did not go into retirement; he has been biding his time. But 
the big British monopolists, the true masters of the country, have not 
forgotten one of the most experienced leaders of the Intelligence Service. 
Ismay was offered the post of Director of Lloyd's Bank, an enterprise 
with working capital of at least 1.25 billion pounds sterling. 
The threads of this financial group entwine through all the corners 
of British capitalist society. It is primarily the bank of heavy industry 
and the monetary bulwark of British reaction. In recent years its direc-
tors have included such big shots as Sir Peter Bennett, head of the 
largest war electrical concern, Joseph Lucas, Ltd., member of the board 
of the Imperial Chemical Trust, and in 1951, Deputy Minister of Labour 
and National Service; Colonel Neilson, Director of Vickers; Lord Brand 
and his son, Thomas Brand, partners in the well-known London banking 
house, Lazard Brothers, affiliated with the Astor dynasty and with the 
Times, and which financed Chamberlain's "Cliveden Clique"; Lord Luke, 
owner of the Bovril Bouillon Trust and the Truth magazine; Lord Ramsden, 
Director of a number of metallurgy enterprises and also the former Chair-
man of the Conservative Party; Sir Evan Williams, Life President of the 
Mining Association of Great Britain; and others. Also, the old Liberal 
leaders, Lord Teviot and Egbert Cadbury (who is also the head of a cocoa 
and chocolate trust and co-owner of the News Chronicle); former member 
of the Labour Government's State Planning Administration, aircraft 
monopolist, Verdon Smith; former Chief of "Combined Operations" of the 
British Army, General Laycock; and finally, at least three former Anglo-
Indian governors and ministers - Lord Scarbrough, Burrows, and Reisman, 
have also sat on the board of Lloyd's Bank, 
Lloyd's Bank is, so to speak, a stronghold, a holy of holies of 
British monopolistic capital; to be its director means being one of the 
real owners of the country. 
Ismay became a director of this bank. The veteran of the Intelli-
gence Service received his reward. Now he himself has become one of the 
partners in the "British Empire" concern. The British monopolies do not 
forget those who serve them faithfully. 
VI 
But Ismay's service was not yet finished. 
On 26 October 1951, the leader of the British Conservatives, having 
beaten the Labour Party in the elections, was called to the Royal Palace 
and received instructions to form a new government. One of the first 
he called was General Lord Ismay. After a few days Great Britain read 
the list of the 17 new cabinet members. Ismay was appointed Secretary 
of State for Commonwealth Relations, in other words, minister of 
dominions.

How could Great Britain's international position be consolidated? 
This was the problem facing thc new government. The Labour cabinet, which 
ruled Great Britain for six years, had continued the old, prewar Conserva-
tive policy - a policy aimed against the Soviet Union, against the colo-
nial and dependent peoples, and now also against the people's democracies. 
Formerly this policy had been based mainly on the agreement with Hitler. 
It led Great Britain to the brink of destruction. All who wished to de-
ceive the Soviet Union were deceived themselves by German Fascism. Now 
the same policy, directed against the USSR, has been based on an agree-
ment with American imperialism and the German desire for revenge. 
American trusts had already become masters in various parts of 
Britannitk, taking its natural riches. American capital had clearly 
been striving to squeeze the British economy within its grip. American 
diplomacy had rudely thrust its will upon the British Empire, once the 
proudest and most arrogant in Europe. A gloomy future was facing Great 
Britain -- that of becoming one of the chief American atomic bases 
against the USSR. 
Where to go from here? 
The Ismays had an answer ready --the way they had been going -- with 
the Atlantic Union headed by Washington. 
law remained Ismay. And now, almost 50 years after the beginning 
of his political activity, the man from the Intelligence Service saw 
before him only one purpose, one task: to exterminate the Soviet 
Socialist State in whatever way possible, to strangle the national 
liberation movement in Asia and Africa. The son of the prison keeper 
had not betrayed his ideal. The American pretender to world domination 
stood at the British gates with an even bigger crow-bar in his hands 
than his German predecessor had. But Ismay still gave the same advice: 
? bargain with the US for a while, work Great Britain up into the role of 
chief apprentice, and, with their help, we will seize and imprison half 
of mankind. Consumed with class hatred, Ismay was again working against 
the national interests of Great Britain. 
In order to conclude this transaction, in 1952 he transferred his 
headquarters into the very center of the Anglo-American bloc. Ismay 
? was appointed General Secretary of the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion and Vice-President of this Organization's Council. Upon taking on 
this job, he said on 22 July 1952: "Now I must consider myself as not 
haying a country, and in the future I am not an Englishman." 
The man from the Intelligence Service supposed that as head of the 
Worth Atlantic Treaty Organization he would serve the interests of the 
British Empire as in the past. He took his new post with the conviction 
Approved For Release 2001/07/28 : CIA-RDP65-00756R000300270001-9 
Approved For Release 2001/07/28 : CIA-RDP65-00756R000300270001-9 
that he would at least secure for Great Britain the position of chief 
contractor for the United States in Western Europe, and then go even fur-
ther: make Great Britain the true head of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization on the continent of Europe. It was for this reason that 
"Pug" repudiated his country; he thought that it would be craftier. 
Ismay aspired to be field marshal of a new campaign against the 
socialist world. In February 1951 he stated that a state of war exists 
between the "free world" and Communism. Even now Ismay behaves like 
the commander of a real army. He travels about Western Europe from 
capital to capital demanding a quicker coordination of the armed forces 
of the "Atlantic coalition." 
In November 1952 Ismay proposed that a connection be established ' 
between the Atlantic Treaty Organization and a new military bloc planned 
by the American imperialists for the Pacific area. He wished to squeeze 
both Europe and Asia in the pincers. In May 1953 he flew to Ankara to 
speed the conclusion of a military pact between Turkey and Greece and 
thus draw the Near East into "his" net. In November 1953 he was observ-
ing military maneuvers of British, Canadian, Dutch and Danish troops 
near Bremen, where a German babe is being prepared. Then he gave an 
anti-Soviet speech in Brussels, demanding immediate ratification of the 
"European Defense Community" Agreement and inclusion of West German 
armed forces in the "European army." Ismay already saw the trenches of 
World War III, and himself on the staff of the supreme command. 
But it was not for this that they created NATO in Washington, i.e., 
that an Englishman rule this organization. The Americans, with incon-
spicuous pressure, have succeeded in retiring Ismay and filling the post 
of NATO General Secretary with a man devoted to them body and soul, 
Speak. Now even this position is in the past for Ismay. 
The years pass by and the world is changing. Only Ismay and his 
friends from the Intelligence Service do not change. 
Ismay incarnates the whole policy, the whole psychology of British 
imperialism. Ismay's face is the face of Palmerston, Disraeli, Curzon, 
Chamberlain and other arms-bearers of British capitalism. It has 
nothing in common with the British people. The Great Britain of the 
workers, farmers, and working intelligentsia is against him and such 
as he.

Agent of the International of Death A. Leonidov 
A merchant of death is not only a person who sells rifles, machine 
guns, tanks, submarines and atomic bombs. In the West this job has many 
aspects. It includes many people who have no direct connection with war 
industry. 
Each of them wears some kind of mask. Sometimes the merchant of 
death is a well-known professor. He lectures on physics and also is a 
consultant to a joint-stock company interested in producing the atomic 
bomb. Frequently he is a well-known journalist writing articles, paid 
for by the publicity division of the Dupont trust or the Vickers firm, 
for a large newspaper published in some capital. Sometimes the merchant 
of death is a bishop. In the daytime, in the pulpit, he gives touching 
sermons on love and peace, but in the evening he clips coupons from the 
shares of a gun factory. And sometimes he is a government official of 
a Western power, showered with honors and orders. With inspiration and 
brillancy he speaks at international conferences on disarmament, but in 
his office he regularly signs contracts for massive deliveries of arma-
ments from a firm in which he or his family is an invisible partner. 
All these people enjoy irreproachable reputations in bourgeois 
society. And they all live mainly on the interest from past, present, 
and future wars. This is the secret meaning of their existence. 
Oliver Lyttelton is a very versatile man. He was British Secretary 
of State for Colonies, the main organizer of hunts after African Negroes. 
At his instructions they were executed wholesale at the rate of 100 per-
sons a week. He considers himself and those like him the mainstay of 
British order and tranquility. Everything new is very offensive to 
Lytteton and makes him fearful and bitter. 
Before his entry into the Government and after his retirement 
Lyttelton was head of the British trust, Associated Electrical Industry, 
closely affiliated with the Vickers concern. It is precisely here that 
his chief, fundamental quality, from which everything else flows, is 
hidden. Here, in the offices of this trust which participates in the 
production of atomic energy in Great Britain, that Oliver Lytteltonts 
real life takes place. He is a merchant of death on the very largest 
international scale and belongs in the secret circle of atomic monopo-
lists; he is one of those of whom there are only a handful in the whole 
capitalist world. The success of his business depends mainly on how 
many people will be killed by the weapons and equipment delivered by his 
firm and its allies. The more deaths, the greater the dividends. 
This is why they regard him with such respect in the capitalist 
circles of the West.

Lyttelton's career was set even before his birth. His father was 
also one of the leaders of the rightist camp and was also Secretary of 
State for Colonies. Hereditary suCcession is very highly valued in 
British ruling circles. The old Lyttelton, nephew of the well-known 
Liberal leader, Gladstone, whom he deserted for the Conservatives, was 
famous as a cricket virtuoso. In addition, he was diitinguished by the 
fact that, as minister at the beginning of the century, he imported 
thousands of unfortunate, starving coolies from China to South Africa to 
reduce labor costs for British gold mine owners. At that time the 
Negroes were still cooped up in the depths of the country in their vil-
lages. While the elder Lyttelton played cricket and lelped rule the 
British pire, the younger Lyttelton, moving among the golden youth, 
studied at aristocratic Eton and Cambridge University. 
In 1920 the young Lyttelton settled down to "real" business. He 
began by trading and speculating in non-ferrous metals -- copper, zinc, 
nickel, lead, tin and other metals used mainly in the electrical indus-
try and in war production. The most interesting thing about Lyttelton's 
affairs was discovered only after several years: he turned out to have 
German partners. The trade syndicate of British mine owners, British 
Metal corporation, of which Lyttelton was chief manager, soon merged 
with Metallgesellschaft, the concern belonging to the Merton Biothers 
in Frankfurt-am-Main, thus monopolizing a considerable part of the 
international trade in non-ferrous metals. Sitting in London on the 
board of the new United Metal Corporation along with one of the Mertons, 
Lyttelton became at the same time 'director of the Frankfurt trust. 
This meant a great deal. The affiliation with Metallgesellschaft 
immediately brought Lyttelton into the arena of international monopolies. 
It predetermined his foreign policy line. At the very beginning of his 
?life he found powerful friends on the other side of the Rhine. 
Things turned out in such a way that the chief shareholder in the 
Frankfurt metals trust after World War II was Germany's largest and 
all-powerful monopoly, the chemical trust, I. G. Farben. Along with 
the Ruhr steel kings Thyssen and Krupp, the chemical kings, Bosch and 
Schmitz were the true masters of the bourgeois German state and the 
chief promoters of German imperialism. All the German cabinet ministers 
since-the 1920's, the German Army, the German intelligence service and 
the German bourgeois parties acted at their orders. The I. G. Farben 
trust at first affiliated itself with the German Liberals and immediately 
after their defeat began to finance Hitler. When the frenetic leader of 
the German Fascists came to power in 1933 Bosch and Schmitz stood behind 
him. This fact was also reflected behind the scenes in the making of 
British policy.

For 10 years, from 1929 to 1939, Lyttelton was the partner of Bosch 
and Schmitz,in selling non-ferrous metals to electrical companies and war 
industry enterprises all over the world. He acquired a great deal of 
money in this way, multiplying the fortune left him by his father. But 
he was not only in commerce. 
Ekterna11y he was an irreproachable English aristocrat, a society 
gentleman and a respectable City business man. Actually he was the 
emissary of the greatest Anglo-German monopolistic association, one of 
the secret,representatives of I. G. Farben in London. From behind the 
scenes, along with other business men from this association, he tire-
lessly demanded "complete synchronization" (concurrence) of British and 
German foreign policies. There was talk of concluding an Anglo-German 
union for the most, rapid possible organization of Hitler's campaign to 
the East, to Moscow! 
At the_time.ofJAnnich, Lyttelton was 46 years old. He was not yet 
even an ordinary member of the House of Commons. But among the heads of 
the Right-wing camp he was already considered a prominent figure behind 
cwhom the Anglo-German clique was hiding. When Hitler began World War II, 
turning not against Moscow butagainst Paris and London, Lyttelton was 
no less ast9,4Ade.d 'WAi Chamberlain; his Frankfurt partners had let him 
down. They wanted everything that he had promised them in the East.., 
and the HritiSb Empire also! 
ir 
, Full of patriotic indignation, Lyttelton asked for government 
taervice. His request was immediately granted. He received the posi-
tion of Chief State Controller of Non-Ferrous Metals. Now he could 
httIMIX fi,4 the prices at which the government bought metals from his 
_Am A year later Lyttelton was elected to the House of Commons and 
Alludiately was appointed President of the Board of Trade. Now he 
dictated prices and signed contracts for the delivery, not only of non-
ferrous metals, but also of all types of strategic raw materials. The 
beginning of a great political career was established. 
In 1942 Lyttelton was appointed Minister of State, Middle East, and 
sent to Cairo.. Thenon-ferrous metals king became the real dictator of 
Egypt. He organized pogroms in Palestine, set one Arab government 
legainst the other, and spread a political intelligence network through-
ont thq lpikan area, giving it one order: do not act against Hitlerites, 
but against the national liberation movement. 
After 4 year Lyttelton was again called to London and was appointed 
Illinister of Production. His chief business in this position was the 
creation of the Anglo-American Combined Production and Resources Board, 
to which all the industry of both countries was subordinated. Acting 
through this Board, the American billionaire "partners" began to seize 
a place in the British economy. The Americans went where the Germans 
had not succeeded in sneaking in.

Three years later Lyttelton received his reward. They raised him 
almost to the very top of the pyramid of the international monopolies. 
He resigned from Churchill's Government, abandoning the post of President 
of Board of Trade and Minister of Production. The next day he sat in the 
armchair of the Chairman of the Board of Associated Electrical Industry. 
At one time Lyttelton had served the merchants of death, selling them raw 
material. Now he himself had become one of them. 
III 
Three firms have been supreme during recent decades in the immense 
armaments market in Western Europe: the Vickers trust in Great Britain, 
Schneider-Creusot in France and Krupp in Germany. After World War II 
Schneider had to begin at the beginning. Krupp was put out of action for 
a while. Then the Americans put Krupp on his feet, but the battlefield 
remained to Vickers. 
Today this is doubtless the largest private producer of conventional 
armaments in Western Europe. Millions of people were killed by this con-
cern's death-dealing production. Its plants are located not only in 
various English cities, but also in Spain, Italy, Ireland, Australia, 
Canada, Pakistan, the Union of South Africa, and even in Japan; they 
existed also in Czarist Russia (Aktsionernoye Obshchestvo Nikolayevskikh 
Zavodov i Verfey), in Turkey, Rumania, Sweden, etc. During the past 60 
years there has been hardly any war conflagration in Europe or elsewhere 
in which Vickers was not directly or indirectly concerned. The firm 
delivered arms for both world wars, set the Balkan countries to fighting 
among themselves, participated in all the anti-Soviet plots and inter-
ventions, financed the Hitler organization in Great Britain, and did not 
disdain to set armed conflicts aflame in corner of South America or in 
the mountains of Asia. 
? Its agents operate tirelessly in the capitalist countries, even the 
smallest. Some of them are well-known politicians; others are journal-
ists, bankers, lawyers; still others are shady business men or adven-
turers. Wherever you smell gunpowder, look for the Vickers man nearby. 
Wherever it is quiet, another man sent by this firm is already at work. 
During World War II and before it, one of these agents was the 
notorious Sir.Basil Zaharoff, a Greek. He was born in Turkey, married 
a Spanish duchess, became a nobleman in Great Britain and lived in 
France. The newspapers called him "the mystery man of Europe." 
Zaharoff was a close friend and adviser to the British Prime Minister, 
Lloyd George and the .French premiers, Clemenceau and Briand. 
Clemenceau's son was a sales representative of the Vickers firm in 
Paris. During the years preceding World War II many prominent members 
of the British Government were stock-holders, as for example, Hailsham, 
Secretary of State for War, Lord Swinton, Secretary of State for Air, 
Lord Horne, Chancellor or the Exchequer, Gilmour, Secretary of State for 
?209-

the Home Department, etc. Many British generals and admirals depend on 
this trust by tradition, particularly those of them which deal with the 
military construction and supply of the British Army and Navy. 
The Vickers concern is closely affiliated with the top echelon of 
the reactionary camp in Great Britain. It is for this reason that the 
Right-wing Labour Government did not succeed in nationalizing the Vickers 
trust in its time. To do this would have meant causing a kind of politi-
cal revolution in Great Britain. 
Lord Waverly, former Home Secretary, is one of the directors of the 
concern; he is also director of the Imperial Chemical Industries Trust. 
Thus there is a direct affiliation between two gigantic British war 
monopolies. Another director of Vickers is Colonel Maxwell, son-in-law 
of the late Conservative Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Austen 
Chamberlain, the target of numerous caricatures in the 1920's. 
Not long ago the Vickers concern was headed by Lieutenant-General 
Weeks, who was Chief of the Supply Department of the British Army during 
World War II. Another member of the board, a certain Vivian Smith, is 
no less interesting. He is just a little higher than the generals and 
ministers: he is manager of the London branch of the New York Morgan 
Bank. 
Vickers is the British branch of a peculiar internationale of 
merchants of death. It is affiliated with the American war industry 
monopolies, General Motors and General Electric, with the French 
Schneider concern, with the German Krupp firm, and with suppliers of 
arms in all capitalist countries. The North Atlantic Union, the 
Western European Union, and the aggressive pacts in other parts of the 
world are, in many respects, political masks for this secret interna-
tionale. 
This is the circle that Mr. Oliver Lyttelton joined after World 
War II. 
For a long time the Vickers concern has had a special daughter 
company to which all of its electrical enterprises were assigned. 
Until 1929 this company was called Metro-Vickers. Many remember it 
for the celebrated espionage affair uncovered in Moscow in 1933. After-
wards this name was only used for one of the branches and the main 
enterprise was renamed Associated Electrical Industries. At the same 
time, along this line, Vickers entered into a close affiliation with 
the American Morgan electrical trust, General Electric Company. 
We present all these details to show what Lyttelton, the butcher 
of Negroes and Malayans, actually represents.

IV 
Having formed a new government in 1951, the big monopoly circles 
could not get along without a man such as Lyttelton. The Vickers agent 
had to become a member of the Cabinet. But Lyttelton's government ap-
pointment was not due solely to his place in the circles of the mar 
manufacturers. A considerable role was also played by another special 
circumstance which the general British public has already begun to forget, 
but which the ruling circles remember well. It was a matter of Lyttelton's 
affiliations with the most powerful British colonial trusts, the pillars 
of the British Empire. These affiliations, established during that period 
of his life when he was still "non-ferrous metals king", were never bro-
ken. This is why Lyttelton received the post of Secretary of State for 
the Colonies. He was given the most "critical" section, the so-called 
"black" and "yellow" affairs; in other words, hunting after Negroes and 
Malayans. 
The imperialists would have a hard time in finding a better candidate 
for this post. Lyttelton was the chief of those reactionary politicans 
in London whose personal fortune was based on the semi-slave labor of 
workers in the British mines in Southeast Asia and Africa. His career was 
built on this foundation; while working with Vickers he always remembered 
this. His opinions on the colonial question were set once and for all. 
For him the Negroes and Asiatics are not people, but super-cheap instru-
ments. They do not have the right to think or to feel; their business is 
to work until they can work no longer. If black-skinned and yellow-
skinned persons work 12-14 hours a day, receiving a handful of rice or 
beans for subsistence, and die from this work and "diet", this, from 
Lyttelton's point of view, is in the nature of things; profits pile up 
in London, "white civilization" flourishes, and they get rich. If the 
Negro and Asiatic workers become disturbed and demand more food, freedom 
and life for themselves, this is a "scandal" and "disgrace", and "impudent 
challenge" to civilization, and the Lytteltons are indignant. Then, in 
their opinion, the black and yellow people must be penned behind barbed 
wire or be hanged. 
Such have been the fixed principles of the imperialists' colonial 
policy during the last two centuries. Using these principles, Lyttelton 
earned many millions. He knew his business. 
On the eve of World War II Lyttelton was chairman or director of over 
20 joint stock companies; 19 of them operated mines in various parts of 
the world. These enterprises included such extremely large British colo-
nial monopolies as the Imperial Smelting Corporation, the Zinc Corpora-
tion, the Burma Corporation, the Broken Hill Company, etc. 
Lyttelton was especially closely affiliated with two of the most 
important concerns of the Empire tin industry: the London Tin Corpora-
tion, owning mines in Malaya, Thailand, Burma and Nigeria, and the

British Tin Investment Corporation, owning stocks in many Malayan com-
panies. When he received a government appointment in 1939, Lyttelton 
resigned from the boards of these monopolies, but kept their stock and 
continued to manage them through figurpheads. For example, the chairman 
of the London Tin Corporation today is stock broker John Spens, who was 
Lyttelton's closest assistant in the Ministry of Production during the 
war. The British tin industry in Malaya until this day is mainly in 
the hands of Lyttelton's group. This fact is diligently concealed from 
the people by the British bourgeois press. It would not be suitable to 
mention that he in whose name the government of Great Britain conducts 
war against the Malayan people is the same person who is secretly robbing 
these people. 
Two-fifths of all the tin and one-third of all the rubber produced 
in the capitalist world is obtained in Malaya. The British colonial 
pirates began to seize this country at the end of the 18th century when 
they "bought" Penang from one of the native island princes for 20 boxes 
of opium and an annual honorarium of 6,000 dollars. From this time on 
Malaya was a gold mine for British capital. Two-thirds of the peasants 
were driven from the land to clear a place for the British plantation 
owners and industrialists. Exports of Malayan rubber and tin, during 
one five-year period (1946-1950), gave Great Britain over a billion dol-
lars, i.e., as much as she received from total exports of items of her 
own manufacture during 1947. 
How was this billion obtained? By colonial robbery, organized by 
gentlemen of the Lyttelton type. The Malayans who were driven from the 
land were forced to work in the mines and plantations for one-eighth to 
one-fifth the average pay of British workers. Women and children re-
ceived one-third less than men. The workers in the British enterprises 
were given windowless cabins. Malayan hospitals were frequently over-
crowded with people dying from hunger. 
When the patience of the Malayan workers began to come to an end in 
1948, the British government dissolved the All-Malayan Federation of 
Trade Unions and instituted a state of emergency" in the country. Mass 
arrests, round-ups and executions began. The British plantation owners 
lynched insubordinate workers. The people retaliated by creating parti-
san groups. Then half of the overseas British Army was thrown against 
Malaya. A colonial terror began and continued for about eight years. 
Even the Hitlerites could envy what took place in Malaya. Hundreds of 
thousands of people were imprisoned in settlements surrounded by barbed 
wire. By spring of 1954, 600,000 persons had been detained or arrested 
-- one-tenth of the whole population! 
When these matters were being handled by the Rightist Labour minis-
ters, Lyttelton, sitting in his usual elegant pose on his bench in the 
House of Commons, applauded his "political opponents" who were doing his 
-212-

work for him. Then he himself began to organize the terror in Malaya, 
not stopping at anything. But his equanimity began to desert him. Malaya 
did not surrender. Lyttelton was astonished: neither gallows nor con-
centration camps were effective. Should the whole population be arrested? 
Lyttelton did not go as far as this idea but he was close to it Half a 
year after his appointment as Secretary of State for the Colonies he was 
compelled to admit that the British authorities in Malaya, with his knowl-
edge and permission, not only threatened the Malayans with mass destruc-
tion of their crops, but actually destroyed them, using special chemicals. 
V 
Lyttelton inherited the war in Malaya from his predecessor. He 
started the war in Kenya himself. During three years of his stay in the 
position of British Secretary of State for Colonies he stirred up an ex-
plosion of insurrection throughout the African continent. 
It would be difficult to count the number of capitalist enterprises 
in Africa in which the group of colonial magnates affiliated with 
Lyttelton is interested. From this group's point of view, Africa is not 
only the most important rear base for the British General Staff in Europe 
and Asia, but is also a gigantic inexhaustible depot of most valuable 
metals -- copper, chrome, wolfram, uranium, gold, aluminum, etc. -- for 
making the London shareholders rich. Africa supplies more than half of 
the tribute which Great Britain annually exacts from the colonial and 
semi-colonial peoples; in 1952, of a total 1,222,000,000 pounds sterling 
received in London from the British colonies, 621,000,000 came from 
Africa. In this respect the "black" continent has replaced India to a 
considerable degree for British capitalism. 
Until recently no one could have been as easily and advantageously 
exploited by the Lytteltons as the African Negro. The Negro's labor was 
much cheaper than the Malayan's labor: he worked for one-twentieth to 
one-fortieth of the wages paid to a British worker; children received 
even less. In other words, this labor cost its British employers almost 
nothing. They forced the Negroes to work under any conditions. In the 
gold and coal mines of Southern Rhodesia they were compelled to work the 
rock with their bare hands. At the mines they were frequently kept in 
guarded closed camps, and were beaten with canes or birch rods for the 
slightest "offense". Thus the huge fortunes of the British reactionary 
politicians and business men were created. 
What happened in Kenya? This is one of the most fertile territories 
In the African countries. Half of the best cultivated arable land in 
Kenya was seized by 3,000 British colonizers; about 5 million Negroes 
were chased into "reserves," for the most part located on poor land and 
in unhealthy areas. Forty percent of the Kikuyu tribe were turned into 
a landless proletariat, i.e., into farm hands and workers for the colo-
nizers. The law in Kenya made it possible to force Negroes to do any 
work without remuneration for a period of 90 days each year. In many

places the white landowners compelled them to work without remuneration 
for half a year in return for the right to live on the land which at one 
time belonged to them. One of the leaders of the national liberation 
movement in Kenya said: "The white people taught UB to close our eyes 
while praying; but hardly had we closed our eyes than they stole our land 
from us!" 
Grumbling was forbidden. Kenya was administered by an autocrat -- a 
British Governor General. He had a "Legislative Council." Thirty thou-
sand whites had 39 representatives in this Council, 115,000 Hindus and 
Arabs had 8 representatives, and 5,5000000 Negroes had 6 representatives, 
who were not elected, but appointed by the British from among native 
princes they had bribed. Until recently it was considered that the 
Negroes in Kenya had only three rights: to work, to pray, and to die. 
But during recent years the Negroes have stopped praying. 
Trade unions were established in the country. A powerful organiza-
tipn arose -- the Kenya African Union. Masses of semi-slaves joined the 
movement. In 1952 the African Union sent Lyttelton a number of demands, 
chief among which were: just distribution of the land, establishment of 
equal wages for blacks and whites, cessation of all racial discrimination, 
freedom of action for trade unions, freedom of speech, assembly and press, 
and equal electoral rights for Negroes, Europeans and Asiatics* The 
Negroes demanded recognition as people. 
Lyttelton considered that this was too much. How could such a 
scandal be allowed! The Secretary of State for Colonies immediately 
decided to conduct an experiment. Kenya must become an example for the 
whole of Africa. Declaring that there was an alleged secret terrorist 
society in the country, the "Mau-Mau", from which it was necessary to 
save the British Empire, a state of emergency was instituted in Kenya. 
Lyttelton came and announced: "Statements that greedy Europeans and 
Asiatics are oppressing Negroes are completely false." After this the 
Secretary went from words to deeds. 
Negroes throughout the country were chased into concentration camps 
in which gallows were erected. Those accused of belonging to the "Mau-
Mau" were hung or condemned to 24 blows with the whip. The whole region 
where the Kikuyu tribe was settled, 2,000 square miles in area, became 
a concentration camp. Livestock, the inhabitants' only source of liveli-
hood, were taken from them. Their houses were destroyed. Punitive 
expeditions attacked the countryside. Unarmed Negroes were bombed from 
planes. Tens of thousands of people were seized. By the end of 1953, 
according to data of the British Government itself, 3,399 Negroes had 
been killed. During one week, at the beginning of April 1954, over 120 
persons were killed. The leaders of the Kenya African Union, led by 
Jomo Kenyatta were imprisoned. The British arrested and detained over 
half a million Negroes. In order to guard the prisons and concentration 
camps, a whole army of prison keepers, 14,300, was mobilized.

"The experiment" in Kenya was conducted systematically day after day. 
Elegant, well-groomed gentlemen, sitting in the office of the British 
Secretary of State for Colonies, managed the whole affair. But what were 
the results of this experiment? The London newspaper, The Daily Mirror, 
came to the conclusion that Lyttelton "killed Kenya with his Icurel". 
This is not true. Lyttelton could not kill all the Negroes as he could 
not arrest all the Malayans. The result of what they did was stated by 
Labour Deputy Brockway, who called Lyttelton "the best recruiter for the 
'Mau-Maul Society." On 31 March 1956 the London magazine, New Statesman  
and Nation, stated: "In fact, history can say that despite the whole 
tragedy, the 1Mau-Maul insurrection was the salvation of Kenya." 
Speaking at the Royal Empire Society in February 1953, Lyttelton 
was forced to admit that he could not say how much time would be required 
to suppress the Negro movement. More than 3 years went by. Lyttelton 
still could not answer this question. He will never answer it. 
The front of the national liberation movement in Africa is already 
spreading beyond Kenya's borders, enveloping Great Britain's neighboring 
possessions. 
Founded by semi-slaves rising to struggle for freedom, this front 
is unconquerable. 
No matter how much the Lytteltons fight against the national 
liberation movement, it is growing and becoming stronger. In the 20th 
century the peoples have turned out to be stronger than the colonizers 
and oppressors. Oliver Lyttelton's experience proved only one things 
an imperialist colonial policy, depending on its last, most desperate 
resort -- mass terror, is useless. 
Lyttelton had to admit this fact himself. When, in July 1954, he 
announced in London that he was retiring from the position of Secretary 
of State for Colonies, his letter to the Prime Minister was published. 
Lyttelton stated that he was leaving the government for "personal rea-
sons," since he wished "to return to private life." The hanger of 
Negroes and the murderer of Malayans, acknowledged his bankruptcy. He 
could not force the colonial peoples to their knees. 
After a few days it became clear to what "private life" Lyttelton 
was returning. He went to his old friends of the Vickers concern, on 
the board of the Associated Electrical Industries. "Private life" for 
this man is still trade in death. The organizer of colonial wars again 
changed to the role of behind-the-scenes organizer of a new world war. 
This is what the business man from the London City has devoted the 
rest of his life to. This time he is playing his game not only against 
Malayans and Kenyans, but also against all the peoples of the world,

Field Marshal Montgomery's Obsession A. Leonidov 
Various types of mental disturbances are known. Among the more 
serious are, for example, persecution mania, megalomania, and mania for 
destruction. There are cases when a person is possessed by several such 
manias at once o in an especially severe form. Then the illness takes a 
serious tarn; the patient becomes violent and either attacks people or 
commits suicide. 
The AmericanSecretaryofDeftrise)Jaines Forrestal, suffering from a 
persecution mania and an atomic destruction psychosis, threw himself out 
,of an eleventh story window. Although insane, he remained the leader of 
the United States Army, Navy and Air Force and resigned only at the last 
minute. Forrestal's calls for atomic warfare and atomic destruction 
coincided with the-policy of the American reactionaries. 
This, of course, was a particularly severe case. But there are also 
people who are said to have only an obsession., It is possible that fu-
ture historians willEtudy the question of how many leading political, 
economic and military positions in capitalist countries of the Wast were 
held in the 1950's by people with "obsessions", who never had a thought 
of throwing themselves out of windows. 
Psychiatrists will demonstrate that about the middle of the twen-
tieth century certain reactionary politicans, financial kings and 
military leaders in the capitalist world began to have a certain type of 
psychosis -- a mania for atomic destruction. It will also become clear 
that individuals subject to this disease continued to be regarded in 
their environment as "big politicians", "military geniuses" and "business 
giants" -- just at the time that emergency measures should have been 
taken to protect mankind against them. 
It is true that some people with Mental disturbances have an unusual 
ability to conceal their disease from persons around them. But sooner 
or later they give themselves away. -Here is an example. 
Late in 1949 a Britisher stated in public that a new war "would be 
a-real holiday for Us4- and will kill:lotS of people". 
It is difficult to believe that this was said by a healthy person. 
Fully normal people do not talk this way, even in times of excitement. 
Maybe this was an accidental "outburst", which the speaker immediately 
regretted. 
Three years later, in the spring of 1953, the same Britisher 
delivered a speech at the National Press Club in Washington on the inter-
national situation and on the "European Defense Community". Here is how 
he began his speech: 
-217-

"What is the reason for the mess throughout the world? Probably I 
could talk on this subject for five hours. I shall try to explain to 
you in five minutes what I think the trouble is... The present "cold 
war" must be coiducted on a global basis. This is imperative. But it 
is being conducted otherwise. The next war must likewise be waged on a 
global basis... Is all this clear? This little mess doesn't amount to 
much. Wait a minute, and you will hear something better... To tell the 
truth, gentlemen, I know that I did not speak so badly. That is right. 
In such a brief time I have explained the causes for the present mess in 
the world." 
Then the speaker made the following declaration (we quote him word 
for word): 
"Look at everything that is taking place around us. There is 
nothing that is in full order. The thing is to make a start. I want 
this treaty (on the aggressive war pact in West Europe -- A. L.) to be 
put into effect. Let everything be topsyturvy at first, everything will 
get straightened out later. Set this infernal machine into motion, boys, 
and push it along. Push it along. The French must ratify the treaty. 
They have got to ratify it. No matter what, they are obliged to ratify 
it. ... They have got to do it." 
The author of both the statements cited here is a British Field 
Marshal, Lord Montgomery, Deputy Supreme Allied Commander of the NATO 
armed forces in Europe. 
According to the British press, Montgomery never touches intoxicating 
liquors because of religious convictions. Thus, we must regard his state-
ments as having been made while sober. 
How could such a person become a Field Marshal and one of the leading 
military commanders of the West? 
II 
"He is very short, and to seem taller because he wears shoes with 
very thick soles. He was usually photographed standing on some ele-
vation; then his appearance became more impressive and stern. He was in 
his famous black beret. ... The loudspeakers brought to everyone his 
shrill, almost penetrating voice." 
This is how Ralph Ingersoll, an American journalist assigned to the 
main headquarters of the Anglo-American forces during World War 
describes the first meeting of American soldiers in Great Britain with 
Montgomery in December, 1943. By this time, the London yellow press was 
already proclaiming Montgomery to be a "military genius". This was a 
myth. But his entire reputation as a commander rests upon a myth.

Montgomery was born in Ulster, the northern part of Ireland, long 
since captured and settled by British Protestant land-lords and kulaks. 
The Ulster land-owners and industrials have long been considered the 
most reactionary section of the British bourgeoisie. Even amont the 
conservatives, the Ulster "die-hards" were regarded as incorrigible and 
dangerous retrogrades, stopping at nothing in seeking their sinister 
goals. For many decades, the Ulster landlords took land away from the 
Irish peasants and made them into hired hands, workers or paupers. The 
Irish emigrated to America by whole villages. A chronic terror reigned 
in Ulster. Irishmen who resisted were hanged, or, in less serious cases, 
were lashed and left to rot in jails. 
Some of the Ulster landlords and their children enthusiastically 
applied their skill in pacification abroad. In the British colonies, 
they proved themselves to be top-notch specialists in this field. 
Montgomery's paternal grandfather was a general in the Anglo-Indian 
Army, which took part in the bloody suppression of the Indian Mutiny of 
1857. At that time, as became well known in Great Britain, some officers 
of the punitive brigades acquired a great deal of property, appropriating 
valuables from plundered temples and the property of Hindus who were 
killed or exiled. 
While certain members of the Montgomery family were educating the 
Irish and the Hindus with the aid of gallows and whips, others were deliv-
ering sermons. Combining one with the other was always a tradition of the 
Ulster landlords. Members of their families shared both these trades. 
Montgomery's maternal grandfather was the Dean of Canterbury Cathedral, 
his father, the Bishop of Tasmania, and his brother, a military chaplain. 
The "Black Hundred" North Irish landlords, colonial nabobs who con-
sidered all peoples except the Anglo-Saxons to be of an inferior race, 
church functionaries who were cold as death and who chilled any display 
of a healthy popular spirit -- it was in such an environment that the 
youth of the future field marshal was passed. Evidently, it left a deep 
impression on his thought and character. This man, who dreams of an 
atomic war as a "real holiday" and calls for "killing a lot of people" 
with unconcealed enthusiasm, is still trying to pass for a "deeply 
religious" ascetic. Because of the same motives, the Field Marshal does 
not even allow himself to smoke. A cigarette is a mortal sin for 
Montgomery, but an atomic bomb is a sacred thing. 
Montgomery attended that school of colonial militarism which all 
officers of the British General Staff formerly attended without excep-
tion. Lacking this, their education was considered to be incomplete, 
and they were not allowed to occupy high posts. In the colonies they 
were trained to "command", that is to tryannize the defenseless aborigi-
nes. If someone did not distinguish himself in this, he did not have a 
career. Colonialism is not only the source of the riches of the old

British bourgeoisie, but is also their higher educational institute. It 
is not possible to learn the military art in the colonies, since the 
enew there is unarmed. But it was relatively easy to advance high in 
the ranks. The more arrogantly and mercilessly an officer conducted him-
self toward the colored population, the faster he usually received his 
promotions. 
In the mid-1930's Montgomery, who began his service in 1908, was a 
Colonel on the General Staff_in the Indian city of Quetta. In 1938, he 
was appointed a Divisional Commander in Palestine, where the British 
authorities were then carrying out repressions against the population. 
Montgomery, already a General, improved and broadened hib qualifications. 
Then a sudden end came to the colonial idyl. Montgomery was sent to 
France to fight against the Hitlerites. On the night of 31 May 1940 he 
was hastily evacuated from Dunkirk to his homeland, having won no laurels. 
The general spent the next two years in the rear areas. 
In August, 19420 Montgomery's real career began. As was remarked 
in British military circles, he was unusually lucky. Rommel's Hitlerite 
army was then pushing the British forces back in North Africa, driving 
toward the East. General Harold Alexander was named the new Commander-
in-Chief of the British armies in the Near East, and General Gott was 
made Commander of the Eighth Army, which was subordinate to Alexander. 
The aircraft on which Gott was flying to his headquarters to take over 
the command was shot down by the Germans, and Gott lost his life. 
MOntganery? almost unknown to the British public, was appointed in his 
place. After a month the German advance on Cairo was beaten back, and 
in November' 1942, the British Eighth Army defeated Rommel at El 
Alamein, thus establishing Montgomery's military reputation. 
The British victory at El Alamein was explained quite simply. The 
British Eighth Army by that time had received armament in quantities 
it had not possessed before. The allied fleet was advancing toward the 
French possessions in North Africa. It was to make a landing in 
Rommel's rear. The German and Italian forces were isolated and could 
not expect reinforcements; Hitler had concentrated all his forces to 
strike at Stalingrad. The outcome of World War II was being decided 
on the Soviet-German front, and events there largely determined the 
conditions of battle in the African desert. Today this is clear to any 
serious military historian. The American expert Hanson Baldwin has 
reached the conclusion that "it 'as impossible to lose" the battle of 
El Alamein. 
Nevertheless, after El Alamein many British newspapers claimed 
that the entire victory was due to Montgomery's exceptional abilities. 
An unprecedented clamour arose around the name of the former colonial 
officer-pacifier, who had until then made his mark only as a "strategist" 
against unarmed people. Montgomery was raieed to the level of a

"military genius". The reactionary British circles, which were responsi-
ble for a number of defeats in the early part of the war and were system-
atically postponing the opening of a second front, needed a swash-buckling 
figure at the head of the army, a military "star" who could be flaunted 
before the public. When the British workers cried out at meetings, "Why 
aren't we fighting?", the reactionaries answered, "Look at Montgomery". 
Montgomery looked at himself. There is no doubt that he himself 
-played one of the leading roles in the British press campaign exalting 
him. This general undoubtedly has one ability; he is a true master at 
advertising himself. It is right in his element to make a lot of noise, 
to talk about himself, to "impress" reporters and photographers and to 
appear before the public on specially erected elevations. It is no secret 
that Montgomery often prepares an interview with himself in written form, 
which is then printed in British and American newspapers under yard-long 
headlines, 
Hanson Baldwin wrote of Montgomery: "It was impossible not to admire 
this man's histrionic ability." Noting the "posturing inherent in 
Montgomery", his "stupendous egoism and extraordinary self-confidence", 
Baldwin also remarked that Montgomery's book on his European campaigns 
was written inarticulately", although "the personal pronoun 'I is 
abundantly scattered throughout the book." 
After El Alamein, Montgomery was made a full General and was 
knighted. A year later he became the Commander-in-Chief.of the British 
forces niqh were to land on the.Enropean continent. In this post he 
positively declared himself to be unbeatable. But military history has 
another opinion. In reality, Montgomery personally suffered a number of 
defeats beginning with the landing in Normandy in June 1944, and continu-
ing right up to the surrender of the Hitlerites in May 1945. 
- - 
Iv 
Montgomery began by obtaining a delay from the beginning of May to 
June, 1944, in the landing on the French shore, despite the decisions 
of the Teheran Conference. After landing in Normandy, the Allied Forces 
suffered a serious defeat at Caen. For almost a month they were unable 
to take this city, and lost the entire British tank corps, which was 
thrown against the most strongly fortified sectors of the German posi-
tions by Montgomery's command. In Eisenhower's headquarters, action 
against Montgomery was demanded; he was for all practical purposes de-
prived of the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Allied infantry 
forces in the Nest, In September of the same year, Montgomery essen-
tially lost the battle of Arnheim, where he had planned to win a 
decisive battle so that he could end the war in 1944 with a triumph for 
himself. Realizing that he would not be able to do this, Montgomery 
declared in November that an invasion of Germany would be impossible 
vAta the summer of 1945. It was only because the Soviet Army was Con-

to act. If World War II had developed as Montgomery wanted it to, and 
not as the Soviet Union wanted it, Hitler would have been able to recover 
from the blows struck at him and to prepare carefully for a spring cam-
paign. 
When Hitler counterattacked in the Ardennes in December, 1944, 
Montgomery, according to Ingersoll, "became panicky", ordered his units 
to retreat and 'almost ruined everything". As is well known, the Soviet 
Army's advance on the eastern front, which the British urgently requested 
from the Soviet High Command, enabled Montgomery to avoid a complete de-
feat and permitted the British Army to ward off another Dunkirk. Never-
theless after the Ardennes battle Montgomery handed the press an interview 
composed by himself in which he claimed that he personally saved the sit-
uation and won the battle. 
At the end of March 1945, when the Soviet Army was completing its 
defeat of the Hitlerites, Montgomery decided to cross the Rhine. Now he 
had the aim of breaking quickly into the German plain in order to attempt 
-- as was clearly established subsequently -- to outrace the Soviet Army 
in capturing Berlin. But Montgomery failed here also. 
Berlin was taken by the Soviet Army. The war was over. Montgomery 
collected the weapons surrendered by the Germans so that it would be pos-
sible some time to direct them -- together with the Hitlerites themselves 
in the Western Zone -- against the socialist countries. As far back as 
the spring of 1945 Montgomery was thinking of what is now being considered 
day and night in the headquarters of the North Atlantic bloc. 
V 
Such is a brief sketch of the military career of this noisy Field 
Marshal, who, according to the American writer Ingersoll, is considered 
by the Americans to be a "mediocre general". We must admit that 
Montgomeryls prestige as a commander has been "gilded" by himself and 
his influential protectors. This is the principal secret of his career. 
We must take into account that it is these same benefactors who play the 
principal role in everything that is done, said and dreamed by the 
present Deputy Supreme Commander of the NATO Armed Forces in Urope. 
Montgomery is a product of British imperialism. His personal 
"pecularities and obsessions", his mania for destruction and his atomic 
psychosis to some extent reflect the condition in which British monopoly 
capital finds itself at present. Its condition is extremely serious, 
the most serious in its history. This is why some "heroes" of British 
imperialism today differ so in their conduct and in their calibre from 
such "heroes" in the last century. It has long been known that in every 
historical era and in every country the calibre and conduct of the lead-
ing politicians and statesmen is determined primarily by the situation 
of the class which they represent. In its heyday, a class brings forward

-individuals who are quite different in their talent from those it brings 
forward during its decline. This is seen particularly clearly in the case 
of Montgomery. 
British capitalism is in decline. At one time it had first place in 
the bourgeois world and dictated its will to 600,000,000 people, a quarter 
of all mankind. The territory of the British colonial empire was almost 
170 times as great as the territory of Great Britain. Now British monop-
oly capitalism is in the grips of a crisis. Its colonial empire is falling 
apart before our eyes, and the military adventures undertaken to restore 
it are failing. The peoples of Asia and Africa are pushing the decrepit 
British lion from all sides. The American billionaires are taking over 
its former positions. 
Daring such a time the exaltation of such persons as Montgomery by 
the British bourgeoisie cannot cause any wonder. It is in need of people 
suffering from aggressive psychoses who demand that "everything be topsy-
turvytt The bankrupt colonialists are placing their bets on the former 
colonial pacifier who has lost any contact with reality. Montgomery is 
unable to understand that he will not have a chance to pacify anyone the 
way he did in the old days or on that scale. It has never occurred to 
him that the world today is not like what Ireland and India were in his 
youth and that it is not afraid of his lash. 
He is now seventy years old, but is still self-confident. In his 
speeches in recent years he always repeats the same thing -- a typical 
trait of people possessed by obsessions. He presages a "holiday" of war, 
and with a kind of voluptuousness presents a picture of a "mass atomic 
bombardment of the East", as he visualizes it. When one becomes ac-
quainted with Montgomery's speeches, one gains the impression that there 
is no room for any other thoughts in his head. 
In October, 1953, Montgomery declared: "Though the population of 
the NATO countries consists of 400,000,000 persons, and the population 
of the Soviet bloc amounts to 800,000,000, our side has unequalled 
spiritual power". What does this person mean by spiritual power? Of 
course, the atomic bomb. On 8 October 1954 he confirmed this, stating 
in Ankara: "Some say that atomic weapons will not be used if war breaks 
out. I do not share this point of view. We shall be obliged to use 
atomic weapons." Two weeks later Montgomery reported in a lecture at 
the Royal United Service Institution: "We in the NATO headquarters are 
basing all our plans for military operations on the use of atomic and 
nuclear weapons." And four months later, speaking in the American city 
of Pasadena, he again explained how he understood the incomparable 
"spiritual power" of the Atlantic bloc: "We shall not be able to with-
stand the force which might be unleashed against us if we do not use 
nuclear weapons".

It was 1955 and the beginning of 1956. "The spirit of Geneva" was 
dispelling the atmosphere of the "cold war". The great majority of 
Englishmen were joyfully greeting the prospects of a peaceful coexistence 
of the two systems. But Montgomery talked, talked, talked -- and all 
about the same thing. 
On 5 November 1955 he declared in Denver: "The fear of atomic des-
truction is Strengthening peace." What does this mean? Only one thing, 
that the more atomic and hydrogen bombs there are, the more fear there 
is, and the more fear there is, the stronger peace is. Conclusion: 
more bombs. Such is this man's "logic". Of what interest to him are 
the intelligent arguments which say that to strengthen peace no atomic 
bombs at all should exist. 
A month later, at a meeting of the NATO Council in Paris, he openly 
advocated preparation for an "unlimited nuclear war". On 10 October 
19560 Montgomery delivered a lecture at the Royal Military Academy in 
London With the title: "A Panorama of War in the Atomic Age". At last 
he was offered a topic to his own taste. Montgomery presented his 
"panorama" with such satisfaction, and talked about the horrors of the 
"future war" with such cynicism that, as the right-wing British news-
paper, Daily Mail, was obliged to report, the audience at the lecture 
listened o i in gloomy silence". Montgomery again called for an 
anti-Communist 'crusade" and criticized the western powers for "insuf-
ficient preparation for nuclear warfare". He demanded the preparation 
of a "general global plan against Communism" and called upon the coun-
, ,tries of the West to "make every effort" to supply the army with atomic 
weapons. 
After this rollicking lecture of Montgomeryls, a commentator in the 
Daily Mirror, the largest newspaper in London, wrote: "I ask you, what 
would we say if some Soviet commander, equal in rank to Lord Montgomery, 
were to mount a lecture platform and describe in detail how Russia is 
preparing to defeat and destroy us ten years from now and how no mercy 
would or could be shown to the survivors?" 
, It is understandable how a person such as Montgomery talks about 
the mass destruction of people with satisfaction. But still the indefat-
igable atomic travelling salesman does not want to think about his not 
being alone in possessing nuclear and hydrogen weapons. He forgets the 
fact which all sane persons in Great Britain are constantly pointing 
out, that the island of Britain is extremely vulnerable to atomic war-
fare. He prefers not to elaborate upon this topic. All he wants is to 
"make a ?start", "to set the infernal machine into motion", and to turn 
"everything topsyturvy". Perhaps he has already prepared a number of 
additional sensational interviews with himself in the event that these 
things do take place.

VII. 
We have already explained how and why Montgomery has been brought 
forward. However, in recent years his reputation in Great Britain has 
suffered considerably because of his pathological atomic fantasies. Still 
he has been left in his position. It is not hard to guess the reason. 
The atomic psychosis of militarists is advantageous to those who 
profit by them, namely the largest war monopolies of the West, which are 
selling armament to the Atlantic bloc, that is, to Montgomery. It is not 
superfluous to note that the former Chief of Staff, Montgomery's friend, 
General Weeks, until recently headed the British trust, Vickers, which 
is manufacturing much of the equipment of the British Army, Navy and Air 
Force. The more aggressively Montgomery speaks, the faster grow the 
dividends of the war monopolies which his friends direct. In the final 
analysis, the Field Marshal is working on the London and New York stock 
exchanges. 
In 1953, Montgomery's family became directly related to the British 
-monopoly oligarchy; the Field Marshal's son, David, married the daughter 
of the President of the Federation of British Industries, Charles 
Connell, owner of one of Scotland's leading ship-building enterprises. 
Montgomery cannot be separated from the reactionary monopolists of 
the City. But while Montgomery is of the same flesh and blood as British 
capitalism during its historical crisis, he must in no way be confused 
with the British people. As in the cases of General Ismay and the 
moliopolist Lyttelton, there is nothing in common between Montgomery and 
the ordinary Englishman or the British worker. As far back as January 
1954, the London newspaper, Daily Sketch, wrote: "Montgomery has called 
a future atomic war a 'trifling matter'. Regretably, it is difficult 
to keep Montgomery from making a fool of himself. But we can at least 
repudiate his crude blunder and ask him to keep his trap shut in the 
future." 
Montgomery did not heed this advice. Soon Greenwood, a member of 
Parliament, stated: .The time has come for this intriguer Montgomery 
to keep quiet." 
Doctors state that one should not expect quiet from people with 
mental "peculiarities" -- especially, we may add, when these people are 
connected with the stock market. 
Three years ago, Columbia University in New York awarded Montgomery 
the honorary degree of Doctor of Jurisprudence. However, the people of 
the world have given Montgomery another title, which also is connected 
with law. They consider him guilty of participating in the plot against 
peace.

Once the French journal Usine Nouvelle, not without a tremor of 
feeling in its voice, stated:_ "The Ruhr has again become a symbol --
the symbol of a mighty heavy industry which is a dangerous competitor 
in peace time and a gigantic center of war production," 
...When bourgeois writers talk about the Ruhr, their breath stops for 
a moment. "Unique" is an epithet which they honor it with so often that 
theAmeriean journal United Nations World calls this epithet "tiresome". 
This, however, does not prevent the Ruhr from remaining truly a unique 
Area Of its type in the richness of its mineral deposits, in the advan-
tages of its location, in the strength of its economy and in the concen-
tration of its industry. 
In a small territory along the river Rahr (a right tributary of the 
Ziline, sixty kilometers from east to west and twenty to thirty kilo-
'Meters from north to south, is concentrated the war-industry smithy of 
Germany. 
"Here in the Bahr", writes the American journal New York Times  
Magazine, "are located the steel mills and metal-processing plants which 
supp ie Wilhelm II and Hitler with everything they needed to almost at-
tain victory". (The word "almost" is correct; we must not forget this.) 
In this Small scrap of German soil are located three-quarters of all the 
coal deposits in Germany, estimated at 250,000,000,000 tons (the largest 
in Western Europe). The coal from the Ruhr is of excellent quality, and 
is ideal for conversion into coke. The Ruhr accounts for seventy per 
cent of coal production in West Germany and seventy to eighty per cent 
of the metal production of all of Germany. 
Nowhere in the world is there such a concentration of all types of 
heavy industry in such a small area as there is in the Ruhr. On the 
basis of the coal: not only the metal, but also the chemical industry 
_flourishes here; they are closely intertwined. The coal of the RUhr 
goes into the blast furnaces of the metallurgical plants, and the gas 
by-products of the furnaces are used by the chemical enterprises.

Every square kilometer of the Ruhr valley is a continuous alternation 
of mines and plants, plants and mines. The industrial cities of the Ruhr 
Essen, Duisburg, Dortmund and Dusseldorf -- are located so close to 
each other that if one has a bird's eye view of the Ruhr, it appears to 
be a single continuous city. 
Transportation facilities in the Rthr are excellent. Railroads and 
river canals cover the Ruhr region in a thick network. Along the Rhine 
and along railroads through Holland, the production of the Ruhr beats a 
path to the sea. The Dortmund-Ems canal connects the Ruhr with the 
North Sea. The freight turnover of the Ruhr is enormous. The Ruhr im-
ports iron ore, scrap iron, lumber, cement, other building materials, and 
a substantial amount of food; it exports coal, pig iron, cast iron, steel, 
numerous metallurgical industry products and chemicals. 
Over two million highly qualified specialists and workers are con-
centrated in the Ruhr. 
The high concentration of war production, the enormous natural re-
sources, the excellent transportation connections, the highly qualified 
working force -- these factors are attracting the greedy eyes of inter-
national imperialistic reaction to the Ruhr. This is why the Ruhr was 
spared during the war and was quickly reborn after its occupation. 
The Golden Rain 
Immediately after the defeat of the'Hitlerites in West Germany, 
emissaries of the largest American and British monopolies rushed in. 
After hastily putting on military uniforms and diplomatic dinner jackets, 
they took matters into their own hands. General Lucius Clay was made the 
first American High Commissioner in West Germany; he was Chairman of 
the Board of Directors of the Continental Can Company and a Director of 
the copper,mining company Newmont Mining. Another general, William 
Draper, Vice-President of the large American bank, Dillon, Reid and 
Company, was assigned as financial advisor to Clay. The American occupa-
tion organizations controlling the west German mining and metal industry 
turned out to be in the hands of the largest steel companies of the 
United States, chiefly United States Steel. When, on 26 February 1949, 
the "German administrators" were appointed to put the "de-cartelized" 
steel mills into operation, the control over their activities was en-
trusted to the American observers William Brinkerhof, Werner Nauman, 
Ronald Clark, and I. F. L. Elliott. All four were representatives of 
United States Steel. 
_Exceptional activity was shown in the Ruhr also by the largest 
banking groups in the United States -- the Warburg and "Kuhn, Loeb and 
Company" groups, the First National Bank, the Rockefeller banking house, 
and likewise the Societe Generale de Belgique, controlled by Wall Street.

The former American .grigh Commissioner John McCloy was a henchman of the 
American financial oligarchy, especially the Rockefeller-controlled Chase 
National sank (now the Chase Manhattan Bank). These people, according to 
the author of the pamphlet "Diary of democracy," H. A. Toulmin, "preserved 
and protected" the pre-war cartels. In general, as was pointed out in the 
pamphlet published in Great Britain in March, 1954, Who Controls West  
German Industry?, "the restoration of German industry was chiefly financed 
by American tunds and through the same people as in the 1920's." Today 
mankind knows why that dangerous game was played. Someone across the 
ocean wanted to use Germany as a mercenary soldier to strangle the young 
Soviet Russia. But the disobedient soldier undertook to strangle the 
whole world, including his benefactors. 
After German heavy industry was restored following World War I, 
largely with loans of American dollars provided by United States monopo-
lies, a considerable role in converting these loans into heavy industry 
with the aim of reviving the war potential of aggressive German militarism 
was played by one of the directors of the Bank of Germany, Hermann Abs. 
Later be became one of Hitler's principal financial advisers. Here is 
what was written about him by,the American Section of the Allied Control 
0014141 aa recently as November, 1946: "Abs was the driving force of the 
Bank of Germany, in which an unusual concentration of economic power was 
combined with active participation in the criminal policy of the Nazi 
regime. Abs gave all his attention to the spreading of German rule over 
Europe." 
Despite this "flattering" description, or more likely because of it, 
Abs wound UP after World War II not on the defendants' bench, but in the 
poSition of Financial Adviser to the Western occupying powers. Subse-
quently he was transferred to the chairmanship of the Commission of 
Economic Questions of the Council of Europe. (The old love of Abs for 
Fiurope evidently had not died away.) In 1948 in West Germany the 
American authorities established the "Credit ISnk for Reconstruction", the 
President of which was the former assistant of Schacht in the Reichsbank, 
?),chniewind, and the vice-president, Abs. The rebirth of West German 
-m411tary industry was financed through this bank. In the years 1948 to 
1950 alone 42.8 billion marks were invested for this purpose in West 
GerManY; 4 billion of this sum came from the funds of the "Marshall plan". 
After 19500 the "Credit Bank for ,Reconstruction" (let me add the 
words "of War Industry") became the transfer point for American private 
an government investments in the industry of the Ruhr. 
Funds were also released which the West German monopolies, forseeing 
the possibility of the defeat of Germany, had transferred in sufficient 
time to their accounts in Swiss banks.

The results of all these investments were soon to be seen; the pro-
duction index in West Germany by the end of 19.55 amounted to 214, with 
1936 taken as 100. The heavy industry of the Ruhr is developing espe-
pially quickly. "Things in the Ruhr", reports the American journal 
Nation, "are probably going better than in any other industrial center 
in Europe." 
Seeking to restore their production as quickly as possible, the 
German monopolies were obliged to make many concessions to their American 
competitors, which had become dominant as a result of World War II. The 
pre-war cartel agreements between the United States and West Germany were 
revised in favor of the former. The American company General Motors, 
which even before the war had acquired a large block of shares in the 
largest automobile-manufacturing firm, Opel, is continuing its advance. 
The Ford Company has expanded its plants at Cologne and has undertaken 
the construction of a new group of automobile enterprises which will 
manufacture automobiles and trucks, as well as armored vehicles. The 
controlling interest in the shares of the west German firms Opel, Ford-
werke, and Daimler-Benz, providing about two thirds of the entire auto-
mobile production of West Germany, according to press reports, are now 
located in the safes of American monopolies. The control over the oil 
induqtry of West Germany has passed to the American oil monopolies 
? Standard Oil of New Jersey and Socony-Vacuum Oil. Krupp has had to 
yield, too. As reported in the Italian newspaper Avantil very large 
blocks of shams in the Krupp enterprises have gone to the former United 
States ambassador in France, Douglas Dillon, and to William Draper of 
Dillon, Reid and Company. Other Wall Street shareholders have also 
appeared. 
For the time being, the West German monopolies are reconciled to 
these gains of their American competitor. The point is that they share 
the same goal -- to restore the military industrial complex of the Ruhr. 
But the magnates of West German industry are looking far ahead; they are 
preparing for the return of their former domination over Europe, and 
indeed over more than Europe. They are dreaming of the time when they 
will be able to occupy all the positions which they have lost to the 
monopolies of the United States. 
"Flaying with Blocks" 
Shortly after the war, the American newspaper Wall Street Journal 
wrote cynically that the United States "is accepting with real enthusiasm 
the idea of restoring the military industry of the Ruhr". By 1951, this 
"idea" had become a reality, and by this time 317 plants in west Germany 
were engaged in war production. At the present time, the number of such 
plants, according to quite incomplete statistics, exceeds 400.

? The concentration of economic power into the hands of the Ruhr coal 
and steel kings is proceeding at high speed. According to the ADIN agency, 
a little over twenty Ruhr magnates have now concentrated in their hands 
97 per cent of the steel production of West Germany, 85 per cent of the 
cast-iron output, and 91 per cent of the rolled steel. 
Tne pre-war trusts and cartels are being born again. 
The most powerful German steel trust Vereinigte Stahlwerke? with a 
slight change in its signboard, is again dominant in the Ruhr. The 
Thyssen Company -- the nucleus of the Vereinigte Stahwerke is vigorously 
consolidating itself. Its largest units, Huttenwerke Phoenix A. G. and 
Rheinische Rohrenwerke, have already been consolidated. The Thyssen firm 
August Thyssen-Hutte has for all practical purposes taken over control of 
the metallurgical enterprises Niederrheinische Hutte as well. 
A group of west German magnates associated in the Mannesmann firm, 
is not far behind the Thyssen firm. This company has already acquired 
the firm KonsolLdation Bergbau A. G., which in turn hat! swallowed up the 
company Essener Steinkonlenbergwerke A. G., formerly belonging to the 
Flick concern. The Mannesmann Company has again absorbed the firm 
Stahlindustrie and Maschinenbau, which has become the principal machine-
building base of the concern. AS a result of all these operations, the 
Mannesmann firm has become the third in the production of coal in the 
Ruhr, and has fully regained its pre-war level. At the present time it 
is producing a third of the West German output of pipes. According to 
the General Manager of the firm, Zangen, a former Nazi and a close asso-
ciate of Goering, the capital stock of the Mannesmann firm now amounts 
to 370,000,000 marks; at the end of the war it was 160,000 000 marks. 
Klochner, the hereditary Ruhr coal and steel king, has not only 
'regained but has expanded his domain. He has seized the coal enter-
prises of the company Koenigsbornwerke A. G. and has acquired the ship-
building company Norddeutsche Hutte, which formerly belonged to Krupp. 
The traditional name of the company, Klocknerwerke A. G., has been 
restored. The Klochner firm has nearly tripled its capital in compari-
son with the period before the war. 
And what about Krupp? Incidentally, the question mark here is quite 
unnecessary. As a matter of fact, is it possible to visualize a rebirth 
of- the Ruhr monarchy of coal and steel kings without Krupp -- the cannon 
kihg, whose name has become a symbol of German imperialism, a symbol of 
war. 
Krupp, while still in prison, together with the steel company head, 
Flock, did not ask for leniency, in seeking their release as reformed 
swindlers but proposed a profitable transaction to their jailers.

Through their agents, they informed the American and British occupation 
authorities that if they were freed, they would be "ready to provide the 
alliee with certain services". Krupp even promised to submit to the 
occupation authorities his plan of a "voluntary de-cartelization" of his 
military plants, "which would accord with the aims of the western powers." 
The "de-cartelization" of the Krupp military concern in reality became 
part of the further concentration of his economic power and the restora-
tion of his military potential. 
As the west German newspaper Die Welt has stated, "the Krupp of today 
is no longer the Krupp of yesterday, and even the Krupp of yesterday was 
no worse than Vickers-Armstrong or Schneider-Creusot". No one is going 
to quarrel with this; they are all worthy of each other. 
It is not possible, and indeed it would tire the reader, to list all 
the firms and companies, all these innumerable "A. G.'s" and "I. G.'s", 
which Krupp added to his possessions after the war with every method 
existing in the wcrld. In general, as the American journal Newsweek  
stated, "with the return of Alfred Krupp's plants to him, he has again 
become the dominate personality in Essen, the capital of the Ruhr". 
Flick did not waste any time, either. His capital, which amounted 
to about 70,000,000 marks before World War II, now amounts to about a 
billion and a half. 
These are the real results _of the e7cartelizatioW' of the Ruhr 
monarchy. As the British newspaper Manchester Guardian wrote in this 
regard, "the allie84 measures to liquidate the trusts have been no more 
'final' than the activities of a child who knocks down his blocks to 
build them again the next day." 
"Flaying with blocks." Yes, you cannot dopy that the Manchester 
Guardian has a sense of humor. But one cannot also deny that it is 
flippant, because what it calls "playing with blocks" is in reality a 
very dangerous game -- playing with fire. 
When the old cartels and trusts are being reborn and their old 
masters are taking over the control of these cartels and trusts, it is 
quite natural that they will begin to follow their old policy. This 
policy is militarism and revenge. It is not chance that of the 400 
military industrialists to whom Hitler awarded at one time the title 
of "Filehrer of Military Economics", today all who are still alive are 
again occupying key positions in the economy of West Germany, maintain-
ing under their control the most important branches of military produc-
tion. 
. These four "black hundreds", of course, are not playing with blocks. 
The graph of the stock prices of these military concerns eloquently shows 
that the remilitarization of West Germany is going on with constantly

Andreasing speed and is bringing new profits to the West German monopo-
lies, especially to the Ruhr magnates. Bonn is operating in full concord 
with. the Rahr. Military orders are pouring in upon the Rdhr magnates, as 
if a horn of plenty. 
, As far back as the beginning of 1954, the Federal Union of German 
Industry, composed of magnates who at one time financed the Hitler mili-
tary adventure, established a "Committee on Armament", which undertook 
the planning of the capital construction of war industry. The former 
Nazi admiral Meendsen-Bohlken was made head of this committee. 
This committee, like the department for assignment of military orders 
of the Bonn War Ministry, is swamped with work. Judge for yourselves: 
The Mannesmann Company is producing shell cases in its enterprises 
in Osnabruck. West German firms in Biegen and Weidenau are manufacturing 
large caliber artillery shells. In Pfaffenhofen, near Schwabach (Bavaria), 
an ammunition factory is under construction. Messerschmidt has undertaken 
the construction of a new aircraft plant in Essen, which will deliver 300 
bombers monthly; four new plants in the suburbs of Stuttgart are being 
built by the Heinkel Aircraft Company. Work has been resumed on the 
enterprises of the Junkers-Werke GMBH, in particular at the Fieseler plants 
in Kassel, which turned out the FAU-1 rockets during the war. As the news-
paper Frankfurter Allgemeine reported in October 1956, the colossal sum of 
5 billion marks is foreseen as the cost of the establishment of the West 
German Air Force. It is planned to increase the military aircraft of the 
FRO to 5,000 planes within five years. 
Work is in full swing at the gigantic ship-building wharfs of Blohm 
und Voss, where the naval might of Hitlerite Germany was once established. 
The Daimler-Benz Company, Auto-Union and Porsche have received the order 
for the first 7600 motor vehicles for the resurgent Wehrmacht. Orders 
for the delivery of explosives have been divided among the pynamit A. G. 
Worm, Alfred Nobel and Wasag. Over 400 West German firms are now occupied 
in supplying the divisions of the Bundeswehr which is now being created. 
The gigantic smithy of war is in operation. The former war crimi-
nals -- the 1:11.hr kings and those (doubly criminal) who aided them to rise 
and be reborn -- are again preparing a bloodbath for the peoples. 
What is this? Playing with blocks? No it is playing with fires 
"Chain Reaction" 
It was not long ago that the political travelling salesmen of the 
West European Union were praising the Paris treaties in every way, des-
cribing them as a miraculous panacea for all ills arising from the rebirth

of German militarism, and as a hundred per cent guarantee against the 
arming of the resurgent Wehrmacht with atomic weapons and the production 
of nuclear weapons in West Germany. 
Not so much time was required for the fog of words to dissolve and 
the public found itself faced with the certain prospects of supplying the 
resurgent Wehrmacht with atomic weapons. The West German monopolies are 
already preparing to generate the monstrous potion of war in their atomic 
reactors. Such are the results of the chain reaction of the short-sighted 
policy of the Western powers who are promoting the remilitarization of 
West Germany. 
,The Bonn seekers for revenge are already not satisfied with a "con-
ventional" half-million army; they are creating an army equipped with 
nuclear weapons. A "total atomic armament of the Bundeswehr" (that is, 
the Wehrmacht) is necessary, it was announced, according to the West 
German newspaper Der Mittag, by General Heusinger, who is the head of the 
Bonn "Main Military Board". General Heusinger is echoed by another former 
Hitler general, Kammhuber, who is occupied in the military department at 
Bonn with the rebirth of the air forces. Kammhuber also feels that it is 
necessary to "shift the center of gravity to atomic and nuclear weapons". 
Realizing that an open violation of the Paris treaties would provoke 
a stormy and unfavorable reaction among much of the European public, the 
builders of the new Wehrmacht have fallen back upon a flank maneuver. 
The screen behind which this maneuver is being carried out is "Euratom". 
According to its organizers, "EUratom" ("EUropean Community of 
Atomic Energy") is to assist the west European powers in the peaceful use 
of atomic energy. But in Washington and Bonn, people are planning, with 
the aid of "Euratom", to circumvent those articles of the Paris treaties 
which prohibit Nest Germany from producing and possessing atomic and 
hydrogen weapons. 
This was obviously hinted at by the present Bonn Minister of War, 
Strauss, who until recently was the Minister of Atomic Affairs. He 
stated: "The time has come for us to undertake work to catch up with 
what Germany has let slip by..." In regard to the idea of "Euratom", 
Strauss significantly emphasized: "We regard any international or supra-
national cooperation from the point of view of assistance, and not just 
from the point of view of control." The Ruhr monopolies greeted the 
birth of "Euratom." with unconcealed joy. 
The preparation of the declaration on "Euratom", in which West 
German representatives also participated, coincided with the beginning 
of negotiations between Bonn and Washington on the treaty, since signed, 
on "cooperation in the field of the use of atomic energy for peaceful 
purposes" and the creation of a Commission on Atomic Energy under the

Bonn government. As a United Press correspondent frankly stated, the 
bilateral agreement between the United States and West Germany "has no 
relationship to the agreements on the peaceful uses of atomic energy, 
which were signed only for research purposes." Allen, a New York Post  
correspondent, reported that the United States is planning to deliver 
atomic weapons to West Germany. The French newspaper Figaro disclosed 
that West Germany will be given all rights within the framework of 
"Baratom" to produce atomic weapons. 
The functions of "Earatom" which were set up for reasons of camou-
flage are already beginning to atrophy, even though this association 
has not even to begin to function as yet. The Western powers have in 
reality permitted Bonn to possess and produce atomic weapons, haVing by 
their deeds repealed the prohibitory sections of the Paris agreements. 
This took place during the negotiations between Guy Mollet and Eden in 
Paris and Guy Mollet and Adenauer in Bonn in September and October 1956 
with the full approval of Washington. 
However, the chain reaction does not stop at this point. While 
Bonn and the Ruhr are asking for atomic weapons from the United States, 
they are also planning its production in the Federal Republic itself. 
The same general Heusinger stated significantly: "The Federal Republic 
-mmSt become more or less independent of the Western powers and if neces-
sary begin the production of atomic weapons itself." According to the 
newspapers 21212211-1EaDjusilam and Frankfurter Allgemeine, the decision 
has already been made in Bonn to supply the Wehrmacht "with several 
types of atomic weapons" produced in West Germany. 
It was for just this purpose that a special atomic cartel was estab-
lished as long ago as December, 1954, in West Germany, composed of six-
teen large companies. Among them are branches of I. G. Farben --
Farbwerke Hoechst, and Bayer-Leverkusen -- and likewise Mannesmanne, 
Gute-Hofnungs-Hatte, AEG, Siemens, Krupp, and others. 
This cartel began functioning under the innocent name: "Physical 
Research Institute, Inc." But in reality, its creation and activity 
show the irresponsibility of the people who brought it to life. Let us 
cite only the British newspaper Sunday Express, which wrote that "soon 
the Germans will be producing the component elements of the hydrogen 
bomb. Krupp is the atomic boss." 
The rapid elevation of the chain reaction into official Bonn doc-
trine was facilitated by a new heightening of international tensions 
caused by the forces of world reaction, headed by the United States, 
which launched aggression against Egypt and organized the Fascist putsch 
in Hungary.

As far back as the session of NATO in Paris in December 1956, the 
participants in the session, supposedly to "harmonize" the military re-
quirements and economic potentialities of the NATO members, passed a 
resolution on supplying the West German Armed Forces with atomic weapons. 
This in essence repealed the prohibitory articles of the Paris agreements. 
The game was played so openly that the incident managed to do without 
any plants for fig leaves. Not without reason, a member of the West 
German delegation, Felix von Eckardt, declared immediately after the ses-
sion that the most important decision of this session was that "in a year 
or eighteen months the West German army will be supplied with atomic 
tactical weapons." 
Finally, at the May, 1957, session of the NATO Council, Dulles, 
acting in the name of Wall Street and the Pentagon, approved atomic arms 
for the Bundeswehr, on the basis of the principle of "equal opportunity". 
Thus, the demands of the Ruhr magnates, expressed by their mouthpiece, 
' the newspaper Industrie Kurier, for a "just equality" was satisfied. 
The Bonn seekers after revenge, openly supported by Washington, are 
more and more openly beginning to play first fiddle in NATO under American 
direction. A dangerous process is taking place, which, in the cynical 
expression of Max Adenauer, son of the Bonn Chancellor and member of the 
"Board of Trustees of the RWE Power Company", signifies the "atomization" 
of West Germany. 
A further step in this "atomization" was the rejection in the 
Bundestag of a proposed amendment to the Constitution providing that 
legislative action in the field of atomic energy can have only peaceful 
purposes. "The Federal Chancellor has himself removed his mask," the 
West German newspaper Frankische Tagespost stated in this connection. 
Yes, the mask has been removed. The brutal face of West German 
militarism has appeared before the world, threatening it with the atomic 
bomb. 
Who is Holding the Reins of Government? 
Several years ago the then speaker of the House of Representatives 
of the United States, Joseph William Martin, went to West Germany to 
deliver a message of greetings from the American Congress to the Bonn 
Bundestag. The first visit he made was to the Ruhr region, to Essen, to 
Krupp. After the honored guest had inspected the Krupp factories, the 
cordial host Alfred Krupp gave a dinner in his honor at the Essener Hof 
hotel. Only then did Martin deign to go to the Bonn Bundestag, The 
American parliamentarian knew very well that the real power was concen-
trated in the Ruhr. From here stretch the threads of the powerful bonds 
with the "federal capital" of Bonn.

Thq_fpdpral chancellor Konrad Adenauer has long been connected with 
the largest monopolies of the Ruhr (the Rhine-Westphalian Electric Company, 
the banking house of J. G. Stein, the company Junkers A. G., the bank S. 
,Qppenheim and Co. The Vice-Chancellor at Bonn, Bluecher, is among the 
direct,henchmen of the Ruhr steel companies. In 1953, Bluecher confiden-
tially stated: "I am following an economic and financial policy in the 
inerests of German heavy industry". The Bonn Economics Minister, Dr. 
Erhard, former director of the Hitlerite Institute of Industrial Research, 
is a servant of the metallurgical companies of the Ruhr. Theodor Blank, 
until recently Minister of Defense of the FRG, is a large shareholder in 
the Thyssen Company. Furthermore ... But there is no need to go on. 
The West German monopolies are supporting the ruling parties in Bonn 
financially. 
Adenauer's party, the Christian Democratic Union, is fully supported 
by West German monopolistic and banking circles. The support of these 
circles played a decisive role in Adenauer's victory in the elections of 
September, 1953. In the 1957 elections, the monopolies threw several 
tens of millions of marks on the scales in favor of Adenauer. The 
President of the Union of German Industry -- the real government of West 
Germany -- Fritz Berg, significantly declared: "The opinion that an 
industrialist should be concerned only with his own enterprises and must 
not participate in politics has fallen into oblivion." Berg was hardly 
blazing a new trail. The West German monopolies are not only "participat-
ing" in politics; they direct them and steer them in their own mercenary 
interests. 
Recently the monopolies have enjoyed considerable favor from one of 
the parties participating in the government coalition, the German Party --
the party of Junkers, big capital and former Nazis. A brief rejoinder by 
Schacht is sufficient to describe this party: "I am in agreement with 
the program of the German Party." The creditors of the German Party are: 
Reemtsma, the owner of the Hamburg Tobacco Company, who was formerly a 
close friend of Goering and who financed the Nazis: the oil company 
Hochbau-und Erdolgeselschaft S. Deichmann; and, of course, Krupp, who has 
alreacly contributed 18,000,000 marks to this party's treasury.

On 10 August 1952, with due ceremonies, the signing of the treaty on 
the "European Coal and Steel Community" took place. On the day that this 
aspociation began its activities, its head, Monnet, cried with emotion: 
"There is no longer any German coal or French steel, there is only 
EUropean coal and European steel."

In reality, German coal has remained German, but French ores have 
begun to be cast not into European steel, but into German steel. It 
developed that Belgian and Dutch coal are likewise faced with the danger 
of being converted into fuel for the Ruhr military smithy. 
? Who gains from the "European Coal and Steel Community"? Here is what 
the French newspaper Combat wrote on this point: "If one examines the 
decisions made by the community since it was established, one must note 
with surprise that they are nearly always to the benefit of Germany alone". 
The newspaper expressed fear that the "European Coal and Steel Community" 
would fall under German domination. 
There is every reason to have such fears. 
Even before World War II, the Ruhr industrialists proposed the idea 
of an international cartel which is so similar to the "Schuman Plan" that 
they are like two drops of water. According to this "idea", the interna-
tional cartel was to include Great Britain, France, Belgium, and 
Luxembourg in addition to the Ruhr. Since the Ruhr was the industrial 
core of the cartel, the proposers of this idea gave it the central and 
dominant role. 
Therefore, when the "Schuman Plan" appeared, on the basis of which 
the so-called "European Coal and Steel Community" (ECSC) was established, 
the Ruhr magnates joyfully greeted it for many reasons. According to 
the French journal Usine nouvelle, the "European Coal and Steel Community" 
is helping the seven old large steel and coal groups of the Ruhr, divided 
into 41 separate companies, to join together again. West Germany "did 
not limit its freedom by joining the ECSC," states this journal, "it 
gained it again." 
"Lebensraum" Again 
The return of the West German monopolies to the world capitalist 
market is intensifying the contradictions between the imperialistic 
powers. 
As far back as the beginning of 1950, Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, war crim-
inal and former financial adviser to Hitler, demanded in his "financial 
letters" "the participation of Germany in plans for colonial development." 
On 10 March 19530 at a meeting of representatives of industrialists in 
Kassel, Franz von Papen proposed the incorporation of the countries of 
Latin America and of the Near and Middle East into the "sphere of inter-
ests" of West Germany. 
The expansion program of the West German monopolies underwent 
special discussion at a meeting of West German industrialists at the end 
of January, 1953, which was held in Dusseldorf on the occasion of the 
-237-

opening of the bank Schacht and Co. Among the three hundred participants 
in the conference were Schacht, von Papen, Hugo Stinnes, Heinrich 
Dinkelbach and other captains of West German finance and industry. 
The Dusseldorf conference worked out a broad program of action. Here 
it is: continuing close cooperation with the American occupation authori-
ties, support of the Adenauer government, an attack on the rights of the 
labor llama by cooperation with the leadership of the unions, an increase 
in the export of capital, primarily to countries where it may be possible 
to squeeze out British and American influence, an increased financing of 
political parties supporting the realization of these goals, an intensifi-
cation of the struggle against the Communists and Social Democrats with 
the aim of excluding them from public and political life, and so forth. 
:In proposing a toast at the Dusseldorf banquet, the "financial 
genius" of Nazi Germany, Hjalmar Schacht, declared: "The time has come 
again when we can enter the southeast area extending from Sarajevo to 
Japan." 
Not long before this, Schacht himself had crossed this very area. 
He visited Spain, Iraq, Iran, Egypt, Indonesia, India, and other coun-
tries. His trip had the aim of renewing the old ties of the German 
monopolies and to pave the way for increasing exports of West German 
capital. It was just after his trips that he established the Schacht 
and Ludwig Bank in Hamburg and the Schacht and Co. Bank in Dusseldorf. 
Together with big industrialists and junkers, Schacht established a 
neW West German financial group. Why? To strive for a place for West 
German monopolies in the imperialistic exploitation of the "underdevel-
oped" countries and the colonial and semi-colonial regions of the world. 
The West German monopolies, the true rulers of the FRG, have long 
and insistently demanded that Bonn provide favorable conditions for the 
development of the economic war against their American and British 
competitors. It would not be without interest in this connection to 
describe the so-called "founders dinner" held in February, 1954, in the 
Bremen city hall, which was attended by two hundred representatives of 
West German industrial and banking capital and overseas trade and ship-
ping, as well as by representatives of the Bonn government, headed by 
Chancellor Adenauer. Who were these founders? According to the news-
paper Bremer Nachrichten, they were the Nazi bankers Pferdmenges and 
Abs, von Siemens -- the owner of a military firm, Alfred Krupp, Muller 
- the general manager of a joint insurance company, Dr. Hilpert -- the 
chairman of the Board of the Railroads of the FRG, Dr. Konecke -- general 
manager of the Daimler-Benz A. G., Schmitz -- General Manager of Ruhrstahl 
A. G., Dr. Dubbers -- representative of the Hanse Shipping Company, 
Butschkau -- President of the Association of West German Savings Banks,

von Waldtha45en representative of the Reinische Stahlwerke Company, 
and other finanqial bigwigs and industrial magnates. Among the demands 
submittedto Adena4er at this dinner, 41 prominent place was given to the 
doubling of the tonnage of the West German merchant marine and the fur-
ther development of foreign trade. 
The Federal Chancellor/ making his reply,, assured the "founders" 
that their, desires would be carried 014t. And they are being carried out. 
The American and British monopolies, which assisted to a consider-
able extent in the restoration of the military industry potential, are 
now fearfully feeling the "cold breath" of German competition. There is 
no reason to doubt that, as time goes by, this breath will become colder 
and colder. 
Along the Old Route 
Not long ago, industrial and financial magnates arrived from all 
over West Germany at Landsberg Castle, near Mulheim (Ruhr), which belongs 
to the Thyssens, a dynasty of Ruhr steel kings. It was also attended by 
former Hitler "leaders of military economics" Wehrwirtschaftsfuehrer 
and representatives of the Bonn government headed by Dr. Lehr, at that 
time occupying the post of Minister of Internal Affairs. Over two hundred 
guests assembled at Landsberg Castle. 
What took place there on that day, 8 February 1953? The remains of 
August Thyssen, who had died in Buenos Aires and who had been head of the 
great German steel trust Vereinigte Stahlwerke were being entombed in the 
castle mausoleum. That is how the society news reported this assemblage. 
But if one judges by other information, the two hundred gentry gathered 
in Landsberg Castle for a reason far different from that of merely kissing 
the relics of their master, who died in remote Argentina. The ceremony of 
Thyssen's funeral was merely a seemly pretext for the Ruhr kings and the 
still armed Nazis to discuss matters far more important than the obsequies. 
Information which leaked out in the press shoved that a program of 
action for resurgent German imperialism was discussed at Landsberg 
Castle. The newspapers could not fail to notice a remarkable coincidence. 
The membership of the group which assembled in the castle was almost the 
same which worked out the plans for the transfer of power to the Nazis in 
1932 at a conference in Dusseldorf with the participation of Hitler. 
Krupp, Flick, Dinkelbach, Stinnes, Papen -- all these faces were familiar. 
The events which developed after the gathering at Landsberg show that 
this time a plot was again hatched against the German people and their 
vital interests. The rebirth of the Wehrmacht and the general staff of 
this wasp's nest of Prussian militarism, the banning of the Communist

The yar-Oriminal Company. 
A. Galkin 
Early in the summer of 1955 an epidemic of typhus suddenly broke out. 
The first signs of the epidemic were noted in the center of the Ruhr, in 
the city of Hagen and the surrounding area. More than fifteen hundred 
cases were reported0 
phus occurs rarely in West Germany; a typhus epidemic in peacetime 
quite exceptional. The physicians undertook urgent investigations to 
determine the source of the infection. The evidence led them to the 
laboratory of the chemical factory in Wuppertal-Elberfeld. It developed 
that for several years, at the order of the management of I. G. Farben, 
typhus microbes were being cultivated. What for? There was one answer 
-- for war, for new crimes against the peoples. 
' The German chemical company, I. G. Farben, is one of the monopolies 
which is preparing an imperialistic predatory war and helping to conduct 
it. 
The letters "I. G." in its name mean in translation from the German, 
"community of interest". The history of this company shows what kind of 
a "community" it is and what interests it has. They are the interest of 
predatory German,monopoly capital, and the community is born of a joint 
striving towards enslaving and robbing not only the German people but 
also the peoples of other countries. 
when, in 19470 the trial at Nuremburg of twenty-three leaders of 
this firm began, the indictment in their case made up a whole library. 
One after another of these documents were read at this trial. They un-
masked the company in the preparation of the imperialistic war, the rob-
bery of whole countries and the enslavement of hundreds of thousands of 
people. I. G. Farben stood exposed before the whole world in all its 
ugly nakedness. 
Even among large monopolies, the I. G. Farben is outstanding because 
of its unprecedented size. On the eve of World War II, the company had 
177 plants in Germany; 200 plants abroad were owned by it or were under 
its control. In central Europe it had practically no competitors. It 
manufactured everything, from dyes to nitroglycerin and Lewisite. Of the 
43 major chemical products produced by the company, 28 played a decisive 
role in supplying the army, air force and navy. I. G. Farben developed 
a system of producing synthetic liquid fuel for aircraft and tanks, and 
achieved the production of a most important type of strategic raw mate-
rial, synthetic rubber. 
With its vast financial resources, I. G. Farben played a decisive 
role in Germany's political life. Everything that took place in the 
country depended in a large part upon its will. Together with the steel 
trust Vereinigte Stahlwerke, the magnates of I. G. Farben brought German 
Fascism to power.

? ft... We hope that our words spoken today will be converted into 
reality, and that a powerful man will be found who will create a general 
platform for everyone ... for such a man is always necessary for us, 
Germans, as Bismarck was necessary in his own time." 
This was said at the beginning of the 1930's by the head of the com-
pany, Duisberg. Soon the "powerful man" was found. His name was Adolf 
Hitler. He was supplied with money to maintain armed detachments and to 
conduct election propaganda. Among those who gave him these funds, one 
of the most generous was the I. G. Farben. Its first contribution to the 
treasury of Fascism amounted to 300,000 marks. 
It is not surprising that, when he became "chief of state", Hitler 
did everything that the company found necessary. I. G. Farben was ad-
vanced enormous credits -- billions of gold marks. The general manager 
of the company, Krauch, received a high position in the Economics Ministry. 
The largest stockholder in the company, Bosch, was appointed to the 
Armaments Council. Using the government of Fascist Germany for their own 
interests, they obtained military orders for the company. The war in 
Europe was prepared and started at the order of the monopolies among 
which I. G. Farben occupied a' leading position. 
When Hitler invaded the Sudetenland, the management of I. G. Farben 
sent him the following telegram: "Deeply moved by the return of the 
Sudeten German territory to the Reich the I. G. Farben Company places 
at your disposal half a million Reichsmarks". The transaction was a 
profitable one; the half a million brought in enormous profits. 
I. G. Farben, its managers and employees fully supported and ap-
proved Nazi aggression against Poland, Czechoslovakia and France. I. G. 
Farben "received great gains from these conquests", a member of the 
board of the company, Kupper, acknowledged under questioning. In the 
occupied countries, the I. G. Farben company seized stock, plants, and 
trusts. 
In Austria, after its seizure, the company "pocketed" the chemical 
trust Pulverfabrik Skoda-Werke Wetzler. This operation was carried out 
by the director of the Foreign Branch of the company -- its "minister of 
foreign affairs", Max Ilgner. 
In Czechoslovakia, I. G. Farben swallowed the company Aussiger 
Verein, the fourth largest chemical company in Europe. The robbery was 
carried out by the managers Kugler and Wurster. In France, I. G. Farben 
laid its hand upon the Kuhlmann, Saint-Denis and Saint-Clair-du-Rhone 
companies. One of the magnates I. G. F., von Schatzler, played the 
decisive role here.

By the end of the war, the I. G. Farben company included 380 German 
firms and 500 foreign companies. It was capitalized at not less than six 
billion marks. 
The stockholders' profits were accumulated upon the bones of millions 
of people. Slaves from the East worked in its factories and plants. They 
were forced to work with tremendous effort. When some of them died, other 
doomed persons were driven in to take their place. 
In its quest for cheap labor; the company established its plants 
directly in the death camps. One of the plants was located in Oswiecim. 
The prisoners working there served as the subjects of brutal experiments. 
In its laboratories was created one of the most powerful toxic substances 
-- the death-dealing gas "tabun". To determine the effectiveness of this 
gas, the company's management ordered that it be tested upon the prisoners 
in the camp. 
Dr. Fritz ter Meer, a member of the management of I. G. F., was 
later asked whether it was possible to defend performing these experiments

ference to the prisoners what they died from -- from beating or from gas. 
The company was directed by a small group of administrators and large 
stockholders. It was called the "council of the gods". After the defeat 
of Fascism, this "council" was put on trial. 
The list of the defendants included some persons known to the whole 
world: ,Hermann Schmitz -- chairman of the board of I. G. Farben and 
successor to its deceased head, Duisberg; his nephew, Max Ilgner, member 
of the board and financial director, head of the I. G. Farben's spy net-
work abroad, the organizer of the seizure of foreign enterprises, inveter-
ate Fascist, bosom friend of Goebbels; Hoerlein, member of the board of 
the company -- organizer of the production of poison gas, immediately 
responsible for the death of hundreds of prisoners used in the brutal ex-
periments; Otto Ambros, member of the board, Chief of the Toxic Substances 
Branch of the Nazi Ministry of Armaments, and Director of the I. G. Farben 
plant in Oswiecim. Behind these "leaders" came Fritz ter Meer, Butefisch; 
Gattineau; Gajewski, directors, managers, consultants, and so forth. 
The defendants' guilt was proven in the trial with great completeness. 
The peoples expected that they would be given severe sentences. But they 
were deceived in their expectations. 
"The council of the gods" had nothing to fear -- because it was 
tried by an American military tribunal. All the defendants were found 
not guilty.

Formally, the Io G. Farben company was reorganized and broken up 
into its component parts. The most important of these were Farbenfabriken 
Bayer in Leverkusen, Farbwerke Hoechst in Hoechst, Badische Anilin-und" 
Sodafabrik in Ludwigshaveno But the company's reorganization was carried 
out so that its owners suffered no losses. The I. Go Farben shares which 
were in the hands of large shareholders were exchanged for stock of the 
new companies. The managership of the plants was transferred to "reliable 
hands". The old directors moved from the defendants bench directly to 
armchairs in the managements of new companies. 
How is this to be explained? By the role of the American and 
British monopolies. For them, I. G. Farben was a business brother. Its 
cartel ties with British and American trusts were always exceptionally 
close. These ties explain the fact that at the end of the war, as a re-
sult of the highly advertised American and British bombings, only 15 
.per cent of the synthetic rubber production capacity of I. G. Farben was 
destroyed, and only ten per cent of its production capacity for explosive*. 
? The intertwining of American and German monopoly capital can clearly 
be seen from the example of the Io G. Farben company. The company owned 
forty per cent of the shares of the Ford Motor Company in Germany. Its 
management included the chairman of the board of I. G. Farben0Carl 
Bosch. The son of the founder of the automobile empire, Henry Ford, be-
came a metber Of the board of directors of the American branch of I. G. 
F. Edsel Ford, which was given the name American I. Go 
Through its Swiss branch -- the I. G, Chemie -- the German chemical 
octopus owned the large chemical company General Aniline and Film Corpora-
tion in America. The Rockefeller oil company, Standard Oil of New Jersey, 
which at one time supplied about half the German oil market, had a cartel 
agreement with I. GoiFarben. The management of this company's branch in 
the United States -- American Io G. -- included Walter Teagle, Chairman 
of the Board of Standard Oil and the New York banker Po Warburg. In ad-
dition, two special companies -- standard I. G. and Jasco -- were estab-
lished in the United States on the basis of an agreement between Standard 
Oil and I. G. F. In October, 1939, after the war in Europe had begun, a 
representative of Standard Oil, a 'certain Howard, came to a special con-
ference in Urope to find means of carrying out the cartel agreement be-
tween I, G. Farben and Standard Oil under wartime conditions. The confer-
ence, which took place in Holland, ended in full agreement. As Howard 
stated later, the representatives of the American trust came to an agree-
ment with the representatives of the German chemical concern on the 
division of the profits after the waro 
I. G. Farben had close cartel ties ever since 1932 with the largest 
British monopoly, the Imperial Chemical Industries.

The years since the breaking up of I. G. Farben represented a period 
of new upsurge for this giant chemical company. "A new page has been 
written in the history of I. G. Farben" stated the West German economic 
weekly Volkswirt in the middle of 1955. By that time the successor-
cempanies to I. G. Farben and the firms subordinate to them possessed 
over 85 per cent of all the stock in the chemical industry of the Federal 
Republic ot Germany. Each year this chemical company is expanding in 
domestic and foreign markets. The volume of production has grown signifi-
cantly. In 1945 only 800 workers remained at the plants of the Badische 
Anilin-und Sodatabrik? the largest component part of I. G. Farben. In 
1951 it had reached its pre-war magnitude in the size of its labor force 
-- 26,500 workers. In August 1955, according to official figures, there 
were as Many as 36,000 workers. More than 36,500 persons are now working 
in the plants of Farbenfabriken Bayer and over 28,000 in the enterprises 
of Farbwerke Hoechst. 
Official prospectuses claim that I. G. Farben in its present stage 
is interested only in peaceful production. But even in the FRG nobody 
believes these statements. As far back as 1948, the explosion which 
took place at the I. G. Farben plants in Ludwigshafen revealed one of 
the company's secrets. In violation of existing laws, the company was 
even then producing fuel for military rockets. Since the Ludwigshafen 
explosion, military production at I. G. Farben plants has developed on a 
significant scale. Demolition explosives are again being produced by the 
Dynamit A. G. plants of the I. G. Farben group. A factory manufacturing 
phosphorus for incendiary projectiles has been built in Hoechst. I. G. 
Farben was one of the initiators of the West German association for 
financing atomic research. 
Hundreds of specialists are creating new types of war materials in 
the I. G. Farben laboratories. Three hundred million marks are spent 
annually for this purpose in Hoechst. In Leverkusen, 1,400 research 
engineers are doing such work at the Farbenfabriken Bayer. "If some 
sceptics claimed," wrote the bourgeois Frankfurter Allgemeine in the 
middle of 1955, "that the separate fragmented companies would not be 
able to attain the research level that was characteristic of the old I. 
G. Farben company, such doubts have now long since passed." 
Time has effected some changes in the personnel of the management 
of the concern. But one can still meet persons in high positions 
closely allied with the recent past. The chairman of the board of 
Badische Analin-und Sodafabrik is the same Wurster who robbed the Czech 
factories. Otto Ambros, well remembered by the prisoners of Oswiecim, 
has a position in the inspection council of the Trostberg Hydrogen 
Plants, Ter Meer is representing I. G. Farben on the board of one of 
the largest West German banks.

From thevery first day of the supposed splitting up of the company, 
the successors of 10G. F'arben have in reality acted jointly. The 
"council of the gods" has been established again. As in earlier times, 
it has considerable influence in determining the policies of West Germany. 
"When an industrial group controlling a production capacity worth over 
ten billion marks," said Industriekurier, the newspaper of West German 
industrial circles, "is making its economic and political demands, there 
is every reason to study them with especial attention." 
The nature of _these demands is shown by the policy of the present 
ruling circles of the FRG, who have converted West Germany into a major 
bulwark of the "cold war" in I.irope and into a breeding ground for 
militarism and the desire for revenge.

The last German Kaiser, Wilhelm II, once said: "I shall order that 
a revolver and a sabre be placed in the cradle of every small boy So that 
fature soldiers will become accustomed to their trade from their earliest 
age." 
In a figurative sense it can be said that this did take place on 
the estates of the landlords and junkers in families which, from genera-
tion to generation, provided officers for the Prussian, and later the 
German, army. Portraits of grandfathers and great-grandfathers in uni-
form and wearing decorations such as those of the Franco-Prussian War or 
for helping crush the 1848 revolution, family relics, weapon collections 
in fathers studies, customs and amusements of elders -- the whole envi-
ronment and the entire manner of life from childhood here trained the 
future member of the Prusso-German officer caste, who would smugly and 
haughtily scorn all that was not military. Bismarck had the scions of 
such families in mind when he said: "We Prussians are all born in 
uniform". 
In such a way, "in uniform", were born the majority of those who 
now head the west German bundeswehr. Their youth was spent in the last 
years of the Hohenzollern dynasty. As boys, the future generals heard 
the adults exchanging reminiscences of the victories of German arms at 
Koniggratz or Sedan, and enthusiastically recounting the bloody exploits 
of the German Expeditionary Corps in China which dealt with the Boxer 
Rebellion of 1899 - 1901. 
As time went by the toy sabre was replaced with a real one.

For Adolf Heusinger this moment came when he was seventeen years 
old. Today he can say that his life was not lived in vain. The Heusinger 
of 1957 is a Lieutenant General, chairman of the Main Military Board of 
the West German War Ministry, a body which is a slightly camouflaged 
general staff. The general is carrying on the work of famous field mar-
shals; his heels were deemed worthy of the spurs of the great Helmuth von 
Moltke the first to head the General Staff of the German Empire. 
While Heusinger and boys of his age were still Fahnenjunker with 
hair only beginning to appear on their upper lip, one of Germany's most 
outstanding military theoreticians, General Friedrich von Bernhardi, gave 
them these parting words: "A virile man needs only to glance at a sword, 
and to ponder its purpose and its frightful action, to convince himself 
that war by itself is a divine task, as worthy and necessary as food and 
drink". From that day to this, Adolf Heusinger, so to say, contemplates

Approved For Release 2001/07/28 : CIA-RDP65-00756R000300270001-9 
the sword with the eyes of a "virile man". The world outlook of today's 
West German generals was formed under the influence of mentors such as 
Bernhardi. It was formed in a time when it was announced again and 
again that the "German mission" was to save the world from all its Alls 
in the atmosphere of chauvinistic intensity and militaristic debauchery 
which preceded World WarI in Germany and accompanied its outbreak. 
"The ancestors who have gone before" -- the leading figures among 
the German militarists, such as Moltke and Schlieffen, and after them 
Ludendorf Hindenburg :and others of their successors of the time of World 
War I, insisted that the German army by its very nature was destined to 
conquer all its opponents and that victory would certainly come with 
lightning speed. Did the future strategist wonder why the idea of a 
"Cannae" proposed by Schlieffen failed -- this swift movement consisting 
of the outflanking of the "main army" of the enemy and its destruction 
in one short battle? 14,11y was it that, after four years of bitter, 
sangainary slaughter costing Germany 1,800,000 dead, the "best army in 
the world" With "the best officer corps in the world" and "unsurpassed" 
, 
commanders was forced to surrender ignominiously? 
Such a question would have been natural not only for the young 
officer Heueihger. The biographies of the West German generals was 
similar t9 on ,w-lothar9 and they are all closely tied to the history of 
German _militarism over the past four or five decades. The present 
Lieu enant Geheral Josef Kammhuber, heading the Aviation Department of 
the RG -War Ministry, has been in the service since 1916. Vice-Admiral 
Friedrich Rage, head.ofthe'Naval Department, first put on a uniform in 
1914. Hans Rottiger, head of the Infantry Department, was already a 
senior officer at that time. Hans Speidel, Paul Hermann, Gerhard 
Matzky, and nearly all the other generals in the West German Army, 
totalling over thirty by the end of 1956, began their careers during 
World War I. If for no one else, the war's disastrous outcome should 
have provided these men with ample food for thought. What did it 
amount to? After the victorious fanfares of the first weeks of the war 
-- Verdun and 'Marne, and later Pskov -- instead of a "Cannae" came 
months and years of trench warfare with all the luxuries of trench life, 
and finally the bitterness of Compiegne. Did not the young people who 
so passionately believed in the invincibility of the German sword and 
the infaliabAity of their authorities find in this the shattering of 
all their illusions and a reappraisal of all their values? 
, 
No, they did not do so. From the point of view of the German 
military caste, all this was explained very simply. The army was good. 
The strategy was above criticism. The prowess of the soldiers had no 
equal since these soldiers Were ourselves. It may be that some mistakes 
were allowed -- well, lei us say, the plans of the genius Schlieffen 
were not carried out sufficiently punctually, or the "spirit of emulation"

was not sufficiently shown, as Groener, the Minister of the Weimar 
Republic's Reichswehr later argued, seeking to defend the strategy of the 
German General Staff. But in the final accounting, this also was immate-
rial. The main reason for the defeat was that the army, as it turned out, 
was "stabbed in the back". While they were fighting for "a place in the 
sun" for Germany, the "vile traitors", "defeatists" and other "sedition-
aries" were busy undermining all the foundations. In November 1918, they 
perpetrated in Germany -- just imagines -- a revolution. 
We must give the leaders of the German militarists their due; they 
quickly adjusted to the new situation. They were preoccupied with only 
one thought -- whatever else happened, regardless of the military catas-
trophe, the severe conditions of the armistice and the collapse of the 
Hohenzollern empire -- to preserve the army, this "supreme gift from 
Prussia to Germany", as the former Imperial Chancellor, Furst Bulow wrote 
shortly before the end of the war. The militarists saw the the Kaisers 
goose was cooked. And if this was the case, why then, let the Kaiser go 
-- as long as the generals remained. 
Thus, the generals, representatives of the most aristocratic families 
and for centuries reputed to be the support of the throne, and for whom 
the rightist Social Democratic leaders like Ebert and Scheidemann were for 
so long "contemptible Red riff-raff"? suddenly shipped the "divine monarch" 
off into exile and came to an agreement with the new, republican, Social 
Democratic government. The military units recalled from the front were 
sent to defend this government and to suppress the revolutionary workers 
who were demanding that the revolution be carried all the way through and 
that a truly democratic system be established. The militarists foully 
murdered Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg. Thousands of officers came 
straight from the army and joined the so-called "free corps", illegal 
and semilegal organizations which dealt with the revolutionaries in Upper 
Silesia, Bavaria, and Hamburg. The military clique earned for itself the 
right to cultivate its traditions with impunity during the Weimar Republic 
and to prepare as much as it could for a return of the "glorious times". 
It was at this point that the real military training of the generals 
of the present generation began. They underwent it in the holy of holies 
of German militarism -- in the General Staff, disguised under the title 
of "Troop Department of the Ministry of the Reichswehr". In the future 
they were to find extremely valuable the experience which they gained 
during their years of work under the direction of such outstanding spe-
cialists in secret rearmament as General Groener and Field Marshal von 
Seeckt. 
The Treaty of Versailles prohibited Germany from maintaining an 
army, with the exception of the Reichswehr, composed of volunteers and 
totalling not more than 100,000 men. It did not permit it to have any 
aircraft, battleships, heavy artillery, tanks, or armored cars

Heusingerls superiors and colleagues quickly found ',rays to circumvent 
these bans. In 1921, Seeckt the commander of the Reichswehr, presented 
in a special Memorandum his "basic views on the structure of the armed 
forces". Each division was to be set up so that it would be possible to 
double or triple its strength by means of enrolling additional volunteers. 
Under the conditions of that time, no shortage of volunteers was foreseen; 
in addition to the official Reichswehr? there existed an illegal "black 
Reichswehr" which incorporated the volunteer officers' corps. By the time 
that it was dissolved in 1923, the "black Reichswehr" contained 250,000 
persons; after us dissolution, the majority of them joined the storm 
troops of Hitler and Rehm. 
The training of ?the troops, said Seeckt, should be carried out accord-
ing to i program whereby forbidden types of armament could be incorporated 
as Soon as an'order was given. The Reichswehr was regarded as a nucleus 
around which p powerful env could be built in a minimum of time, suffi-
cient, as Seeekt wrote, to strike a "direct blow at the heart of the 
enemy" before the latter was able to complete his mobilization. 
Elaboration in detail of these principles, which were essentially 
nothing but directives on ,preparing surprise attacks against other coun-
tries and on aggressive war, was the concern of the present-day leaders 
of the Bundewehr? who were then sitting in various divisions of the 
Ministry of the Reichswehr and its Troop Department. Heusinger was en-
gaged to work in the camouflaged General Staff in 1927, and Kammhuber in 
1928. Also working there were Rottiger, who participated in the secret 
establishment of armored tank troops, 'Rigel who submitted plans for the 
, 
creation of a large navy, Matzky, the present Major General Laegeler, 
and a number of others. The members of the German General staff are 
described by the British military historian Wheeler-Bennett as "limit-
lessly ambitious people who knew and did their work excellently, unscrupu-
lous mercenaries and soldiers who were interested in nothing except their 
carers, power and influence. They were ready to follow anyone as long 
as he gave them high command posts, gave them a chance for personal ad-
vaneement0, and provided an opportunity for military undertakings. For 
these shameless adherents of a policy of force, rearmament and the col-
lateral eh'ects of war represented only a basis for their own careers." 
* * * 
'"The opportunity for military undertakings" was provided by Hitler. 
His coming to power was a welcome event for those who were biding their 
time in the building on Bendlerstrasse in Berlin, where the highest 
military establishments of Germany were located. A whole new era opened 
up in the lives of the future generals, and, what was especially impor-
tant for their role in the Federal Republic of Germany, during this era 
they acquired further and higher qualifications. While during the Weimar

Republic they had mastered the art of the secret violation of interna-
tional treaties, they passed a visual training course under Hitler in the 
methods of openly and rudely trampling upon such treaties. 
The stages by which Hitler violated each and every international 
agreement are well known. Each of them was preceded by intense and 
feverish activity in the military staffs. Such of the leaders on 
Bendlerstrasse who were for some reason unwelcome to the "Fuhrer" were 
simply eliminated by him; some became the victims of the bloody reprisals 
of the "Bartholomew's Massacre" of June 300 1934, such as Generals 
Schleicher and Bredow, while others were removed without bloodshed, such 
as Field Marshal Blomberg and General von Fritsch. In any event, the 
present leaders of the West German Bundeswehr were not among the few rep-
resentatives of the military circles of Hitler's Germany whose opinion 
did not fully agree with that of the Nazi high command. With the zeal 
peculiar to them, they prepared for the introduction of universal mili-
tary training, which was announced in March 1935, prepared the introduc-
tion of troops into the Rhine demilitarized zone in the spring of 1936, 
established a million-man Wehrmacht, prepared measures to aid the Franco 
rebels in Spain, and worked out plans for the annexation of Austria in 
1938 and the seizure of Czechoslovakia in 1939. They were preparing 
World War II. 
For the "unscrupulous hirelings", each stage of Hitler's aggression 
meant new titles and medals, new command posts, further steps in their 
careers, an increase in authority and a broadening of influence. 
Lieutenant colonels became colonels, and colonels became generals. The 
wildest dreams came true. A festive occasion took place on Bendlerstrasse 
in the summer of 1935; Hitler, continuing to violate the Treay of 
Versailles, officially reestablished the General Staff. Heusinger became 
"his excellency"; he was a senior officer and soon chief of the Operations 
Branch of the Main Infantry Command. It was here, in his division, that 
the plans were worked out for the invasion of Poland, Belgium, France, 
Holland, Denmark and Norway. The notorious "Barbarossa plan" was worked 
out under,his immediate supervision. "Lieutenant General Heusinger was 
indispensible to the Fuhrer," was the comment on the present chairman of 
the FRG's Main Military Board made by General Zeitzler, former Chief of 
Hitler's General Staff. 
The same could be said of his colleagues. The aviator Kammhuber 
proved to be truly invaluable as chief of staff for Hermann Goering, who 
was reckoned the supreme commander of the Air Force of Nazi Germany. It 
was this same Kammhuber who drew up the order to bomb Warsaw in September, 
1939. In May of the following year, he was given an assignment of partic-
ularly high trust. The bigwigs of the Nazi Reich needed to find a pretext 
for terroristic air attacks on cities in Great Britain and France. How-
ever, enemy aircraft were not even appearing over Germany. What could be 
done to avoid the blame for launching aerial attacks against the peaceful

population? A way out was found with Kammhuber's assistance. The Chief 
of Staff Of the Supreme Commander of Germany's Air Forces ordered the 
Third Group of the .51st Bomber Squadron to carry out a raid on -- the 
German city of Freiburg. On May 11, the order was carried out. The popu-
lation was told that the bombs were dropped on Freiburg by British air-
craft, and the Goebbels propaganda machine received the opportunity to 
describe the destruction of British cities as "revenge". 
At present, the leaders of the North Atlantic Bloc and its armed 
forces, which includes the West German Bundeswehr, value especially highly 
the "eastern experience" of the German generals. It is possible that the 
fact that they were defeated by the Soviet Army is considered a guarantee 
of Alturelrictories. However, one point cannot be doubted: the signifi-
cance given to "eastern experience" in the higher echelons of NATO proves 
one thing. It gives away the true aims of this aggressive grouping. 
Ilnz experience which the Hitlerite generals gained in the East has 
some unusual features. 
.t8oOn after Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union, Rottiger was ap-
pointed Chief of Staff of the 4th Army, on the Soviet-German front. Later, 
when he was examined at the Nuremberg trial of Hitler generals, he stated: 
"According to the, orders given in line of duty, only a few prisoners were 
taken." Rottiger continued: "In the course of carrying out my duties I 
had several occasions to wage warfare against bombs," that is, to deal 
with partisans. Later, beginning in the fall of 1943, General Rottiger 
continued. parrying out the same duties in Italy, where he turned up in the 
post of Chief of Staff of Army Group "C". 
The military command of Hitler Germany, whose representatives are 
now commanding the Bundeswehr, conscientiously helped the Himmler thugs 
of the SS and the "security service" to decimate the population of tempo-
rarily occupied areas. "Heusinger readily agreed to transfer to the 
'security service' some military units to reduce the Slavic and Jewish 
population," SS Brigadefuhrer Ernst Rode has testified: "I always have 
felt personally," Heusinger himself stated at the same trial in Nuremberg 
in Deceml?er 1945, "that the methods of treating the civil population and 
of fighting the bands (read this as "partisans") in the operations zone 
provided the highest political and military command with a long sought 
opportunity to realize its aims, to reduce systematically the Slavic and 
Jewish people." When Robert Kempner, the chief American prosecutor at 
this trial, wanted to clarify what the word "always" meant and asked 
Heusinger to specify the time that he first began to have this point of 
view, Heusinger replied without hesitation: "Since the fall of 1942"o 
In other words, Heusinger definitely came to his conclusion on the 
"desirability? of exterminating the population of the Soviet Union at 
the time that the Hitler hordes were rushing toward the Volga and the

and the gentlemen of the Bendlerstrasse (although their information did 
not come from Goebbels' articles, according to which the Soviet Army no 
longer existed, but from more trustworthy sources) thought that this time 
they had really gained the victory. 
The Bundeswehrgs generals also have another kind of experience, 
which is very important to the NATO leaders. This is experience in deal-
ing with recalcitrants. This is especially important for them now because 
the resistance of the masses to aggressive plans is growing everywhere in 
the world. For these leaders it is essential that the Bundeswehr be Com-
manded by persons capable of shooting and hanging even their own fellow-
countrymen. The present-day West German generals proved that they had 
such ability even in their youth, when they participated in crushing the 
November Revolution. They demonstrated it amply under Hitler. 
At the beginning of 1957, General Walter Werck was proposed as the 
Bundeswehrgs commander. In the early days of the war, when Werck was on 
the staff of Guderiangs tank army invading France, he succeeded in having 
four German officers courtmartialed because their "unduly mild handling 
of the civil population put the further advance of the German forces into 
jeopardy." During the last years of the "thousand-year Reich", Werck, 
who had by then enter4d the inner circles around Himmler and Hitler, drove 
fifteen to seventeen year-old boys into battle after he had recruited them 
into "Hitler Youth" organizations and labor conscription camps at the time 
the notorious Twelfth Army was being formed. This army was ordered to 
perform a miracle -- to break into Berlin through the circle of Soviet 
forces surrounding it in order to save the "Fuhrer" and the other resi-
dents of the cellar of the Imperial Chancellery. When the miracle failed 
to take place, General Werck abandoned the boys who were still alive and 
whom he could not take along and left them to find their own way out, 
while he himself surrendered to the Americans. It was not without reason 
that it was pointed out, when Werck was proposed for the new position, 
that he would be able to "carry out the necessary firm policy in creating 
the Bundeswehr and training of the troops". He was "the best person in 
case the Bundeswehr were unexpectedly called upon to carry out actions 
in internal affairs, which was within the realm of possibility" -- such 
was the description given him by the person who nominated him. 
Paul Hermann and Gerhard Matzky are noted for the same "firmness". 
At the very end of the war, the former, with his 264th Infantry Division, 
and the latter, heading the 26th Arty- Corps, were pinned against the sea 
by the Soviet Army in the Baltic Area. Before abandoning their troops 
to their fate and fleeing to the West, they executed for "cowardice" and 
"desire to surrender" dozens of soldiers and officers of a force wilich 
was in a hopeless situation.

General Hans Speidel is considered to be one of the most active of 
the West German military commanders. When the "Main Military Board" 
was being established in the Bonn War Ministry, he was assigned the 
especially responsible position of Chief of the Combined Forces Division, 
coordinating the activities of all types of troops. "A general of a new 
type", as Speidel is called in western military circles, he has an origin 
and biography slightly different from those of most of his colleagues. 
Instead og wearing a military uniform, his father wore the gown of a 
scholar. He was a professor at the University of Tubingen, one of those 
who falsified s-pience, altering it to support German imperialism's claims 
to domination over the world. Evidently, the family tradition of "humani-
tarianise_left its mark on the character and interests of the young man. 
It to true that Hans Speidel at the age of seventeen also enrolled as a 
volunteer in one of the Kaiser's Guard Regiments, and that after World 
War I he also served in the Reichswehr. But in contrast to many of co-
workers, he, so to speak, was not a stranger to education. Reichswehr 
officer Speidel spent his free time in the halls of the same university 
in which Profespor Speidel taught. In 1925, he defended his thesis and 
became a Doctor of Philosophy. 
Dr. Speidel set out to travel. He wandered about the halls of the 
Louvre, contemplated the beauties of nature in Switderland and the 
magnificent ruins of the Colosseum, went across the Straits of Dover 
and crosees1 the, Atlantic Ocean. In 1933, the new Nazi government decided 
that the well-travelled officer was suitable for work abroad; Speidel 
was appointed Assistant Military Attache in Paris. His real career be-
gan-two years later; Speidel left the banks of the Seine to head the 
4FOreign Armies of the West" Branch in the supreme headquarters of the 
German a/vied forces, or, in other words, to undertake the direction of 
military espionage against the present allies of the FGR in NATO. In 
1940 he again appeared in France -- this time as Chief of Staff of 
Hitler's occupation forces. Now he prepared orders "in line of duty" 
to? shoot French hostages and to deport peaceful residents to the Himmler 
death camps. General Speidel also has some "eastern experience"; it was 
he who initiated the "scorched earth" tactics during the retreat of the 
Hitler forces in the Ukraine. 
,) 
The leaders of the North Atlantic Alliance had these varied gifts 
of ,Hans ,Speidel in mind when, early in 1957, they appointed him com-
mander of the central grouping of the NATO Armed Forces in Europe. 
In ,1945, the generals fell upon hard times. For ten years they had 
no titles, and at first even preferred not to mention that they had been 
generals. They undertook in every way to wash the brown off their 
shoulders.

It is true that the United States ruling circles from the very first 
showed their unreserved good will towards the German militarists. But 
the Nazi atrocities were still too fresh in people's minds to permit them 
to ally themselves openly with those directly guilty of war crimes. A 
few representatives of the Hitler militarists were even jailed, although 
they were arrested not for reasons of punishment, but to hide them tempo-
zwily in a safe place. The prisons were like first-class hotels. The 
sentries who were required to guard the prisoners stood before them at 
attention and when they were asked a question they snapped out: "Yes, 
Sir, Herr Feldmarschalll" -- such was the report of the correspondent of 
an Italian newspaper who visited such a "prison" in the West German resort 
village of Werl, where the British occupation authorites were keeping 
military criminals. 
Those Who remained free became quiet. Werck, soon released from an 
American prison, preferred, like many others, to go as far as possible, 
to Argentina. Speidel told everyone who would listen to him that he 
desired nothing more than to return to "pure science". The generals 
found jobs in trade and industrial companies. 
Nearly all the generals -- those who found themselves in prison-
hotels and those who were left free -- had something in common: a sud-
den development of a taste for creative writing. Some sat down at their 
desks at the request of the American War Department, while others did so 
at their own initiative. 
"Disagreement with orders" -- such was the significant title which 
Heusinger gave his memoirs. You see, he did not agree with Hitler. 
Furthermore, he considered his policy and strategy incorrect; he even 
supposedly participated in a plot against Hitler. 
In 1943 and 1944, after the defeat of the Hitlerite armies at 
Stalingrad, certain outstanding representatives of the German generals 
were not able to conceal their concern over what would happen next. A 
group of higher officers plotted against Hitler with the aim of getting 
rid of him and, after replacing him with somebody more acceptable to the 
Western allies, forming an alliance with the allies to continue a joint 
war against the USSR. In particular, Speidel, in one of his post-war 
writings, writes straightforwardly of the existence of the idea of 
wbeginning peace negotiations with the West and continuing the war 
against Russia on a shorter front", The present agreement between the 
Western imperialists and the German militarists has its origins in those 
times. 
On 20 July 1944 an attempt was made upon Hitler's life. It failed. 
The plotters were seized and many of them were executed. Adolf 
Heusinger was also arrested. He "plays up" this arrest in his book in 
-255-

Approved For Release 2001/07/28 : CIA-RDP65-00756R000300270001-9 
every way. But he "modestly" fails to mention another fact -- that 'In a 
short time he was released as not having participated in the attempt, and 
the Gestapo sent him its apologies. 
By the way, even if some of the West German generals at one time, at 
the end of the war, did conspire against Hitler, they did this for one 
reason only -- that Hitler had not lived up to the hopes of the militarists. 
Today, in accepting the protection of the western powers, the generals are 
expecting that it will aid them in attaining the goals that they were not 
able to reach while supporting Hitler. The entire careers of Heusinger 
and his colleagues show their lies when they try to describe their "dis-
agreement" with Nazi atrocities, Hitler war crimes, and the policy of 
exterminating and enslaving entire peoples. He "served neither his coun-
try nor Germany; up until the very time that Hitler began to slip, he 
served National Socialism well." This statement, applicable to any one 
of the generals, was made concerning Speidel by the famous French public 
leader Frederic Manhes -- former commander of an underground liberation 
brigade created by Buchenwald prisoners, and now president of the Interna-
tional Union of Freedom Fighters. 
The generals' misfortune is that they happened to take up the pen 
not only after 1945, but before as well. Now they cannot wipe out a 
word of it, although some today doubtless wish that the literary "sins 
of their youth" no longer existed. The FRG's representative at the 
headquarters of the NATO Armed Forces in Paris is Brigadier General 
Count Kielmansegg. In 1941, when he was a colonel, he wrote a book "Tanks 
Between Warsaw and the Atlantic", which was issued by the "Wehrmacht" 
Publishing House. When he was marching with Hitler's troops across France, 
destroying everything in his way, he "felt like a thoroughbred racehorse", 
wrote the honored count, using a rather striking, and possibly apt, 
metaphor. At that time he was inspired by only one thought: "the German 
sword has been drawn to strike a deadly blow at France". "We report that 
we have completely carried out the task laid upon us by history, Germany, 
and the Fuhrer. ... And the gratitude of no one can give us as much pride 
as the gratitude of the Fuhrer" -- with these moving words Kielmansegg 
closes his account. 
General Hermann Foertsch has been entrusted by the NATO leaders with 
writing the section on the West German Bundeswehr in an illustrated 
propaganda book on this aggressive union, publication of which is planned 
in several languages. They knew to whom they were giving this assignment. 
Foertsch is no novice at such undertakings. For quite a long time he 
headed the Press Branch of the Supreme Command of the German Wehrmacht. 
From his pen came such treaties as "Instructions on the duties of an of-
ficer devoted to Hitler" or "The Fuhrer and the armed forces". "There is 
no room among the officers of the new German Armed Forces for anyone who 
does not support our National Socialist Government with all his heart or 
for anyone who is indifferent to, or especially anyone who disapproves of,

this Government or the philosophy which created it and permeates it" - 
Foertaoh proclaimed. At that time he was merely a colonel, but now he 
has found himself a place among the generals of the West German Armed 
Forces. 
The "difficult times" did not last long. For those who are inter-
eSted in further military adventures, the double-dyed Nazi past of the 
Ritlerite generals and their experience in launching aggression and 
participating in war crimes is not an obstacle to giving them weapons, 
but rather increases their value. In 1932, when Hitler explained his 
program at a conference of the biggest industrialists of Germany and 
promised them military orders unprecedented in history, one of those 
present, the steel magnate Fritz Thyssen, cried out "Heil Hitler" Today 
the monopolists of West Germany, the United States and other imperial-
istic states are counting upon the German militarists to provide them 
with unheard-of military profits. As far back as 1951, the American 
newspaper Chicago Daily News wrote: "Give us the West German divisions 
and we shall not ask any questions; this is our position." 
The twelfth of November 1955, was a big day for the generals; with 
solemn ceremOnies.the first group of servicemen of the new West German 
Army was sworn in at the War Ministry building in Bonn, which was orna-
mented with a representation of the Iron Cress, the emblem of the German 
militarists. There were only a few in the first group, 101 in all. But 
the first step is the hardest. Early in 1956, the size of the Bundeswehr 
had risen to 6,000, and by the summer of 1957 it numbered 1000000. 
At first glance this is not very large, either. For some time, the 
circles determining West German military policy have been trying in every 
way possible to convince the public that they do not really want a large 
army. In October 19560 the first Defense Minister of the FRG, Theodor 
Blank, was even forced to resign because he had comprised himself by his 
actions, which were too evidently directed towards developing armed forces 
with millions of men. He was replaced by Franz-Josef Strauss, who de-
clared himself in favor of ,a "small professional army" which should con-
sist basically of officers and non-commissioned officers. Such a plan 
promises many benefits to the West German militarists. It has a remark-
able resemblance to the plan prepared by Seeckt during the Weimar 
Republic -- the plan of creating a "nucleus" around which a vast powerful 
army could be developed at any moment. The Bundeswehros leaders have 
made this task easier for themselves by establishing a relatively short 
term of military service. This will permit them to provide military 
training for a maximum number of people during the first few years, thus 
creating a vast reserve. 
But the "Strauss plan" has another, more essential, feature. It is 
primarily a plan to arm the Bundeswehr with atomic weapons. It was no 
coincidence that Strauss was Minister of Atomic Energy before he was 
- 257 -

Approved For Release 2001/07/28 : CIA-RDP65-00756R000300270001-9 
appointed War Minister. It was also no coincidence that he was replaced 
in the former post by Balke, one of the kings of the West German chemical 
industry, the vice-president of a manufacturers group in this branch of 
the economy, and a member of the board of the military chemical company, 
I. G. Farben. 
The beginning of the new War Minister's administration was character-
ized by negotiations with representatives of the western powers on the 
immediate arming of the Bundeswehr with "tactical" atomic weapons. Strauss 
was given a blank check in this regard at the meeting of the NATO Council 
at the end of December 1956. On his return to Bonn from Paris, Strauss 
annaanced for all to hear that atomic weapons would form the basis for the 
rearmandht of the German Federal Republic. His rapture at this accomplish-
ment was so great that he mentally began to convert Europe into an atomic 
desert. In particular, he announced that atomic weapons in the hands of 
the western powers would make it possible to wipe the Soviet Union off the 
face of the earth. There have been cases known in Germanyg's history when 
its imperialistic bosses not only made threats upon the Soviet Union, but 
also tried to carry out these threats. It is also known what this led to 
-- that German territory was turned into a "desert" after the country had 
been plunged into catastrophe. After this, why talk about atomic war 
For Germany this will inevitably mean a catastrophe not at all comparable 
with any of the earlier ones. 
Row are the characteristics of the new West German Army being estab-
lished? This is done primarily by its command personnel. As we have 
already seen, General Heusinger, commanding the Reichswehr, had worked 
on preparing operational plans for Hitler's aggression against both the 
East and the West. He has forgotten nothing and has learned nothing. 
As far back as the fall of 1953, Heusinger stated on the pages of the 
journal, Bonner Hefte, that the slogan of the armed forces being reborn 
in West Germany mould be: "Advance anywhere that there is the opportunity." 
The tactics of the "Main Military Board" of the FRG are those of a blitz-
krieg. They were also formulated by Heusinger. While visiting the United 
States in 1956, as reported by the New York Times, he stated that it was 
necessary, "by causing incidents at various points on the West German 
frontiers", to create an excuse to undertake "reprisal measures" which 
"should be successfully completed in two or three weeks". Kammhuber is 
even more "optimistic"; in his opinion, "the outcome of the war for all 
practical purposes will be decided during the first four days". 
The West German army is being planned, of course, primarily as an 
army of aggression against the Soviet Union and the other countries in 
the socialist camp. The entire ideology of a "crusade against Communism" 
has been accepted for the arming of the Bundeswehr. The desire for 
revenge is also being stimulated by a turbid flow of books and articles 
from the pens of Hitler's generals, by their tales of the charms of life 
on occupied territories, and by numerous pamphlets and articles describing

how delightful atomic warfare is, and even by arithmetic problems in 
school books, Ruge, remembering the exploits he performed while close 
to Doenitz* is demanding the conversion of the Baltic Sea into a base 
for operations. The West German journal of military theory, Wehrkande9 
edited by the former General Staff members Kammhuber and Ruge, declares 
that all means pre good in "the struggle against the East" and that 
there is no difference between "legal" and "illegal" methods of waging 
war, 
In describing the careers of the West German generals, some military 
theoreti44ns of Greet Britain and France, as well as of the United States 
-- for example, Fuller, Liddell Hart, or Wheeler-Bennett note only one 
part of their "military experience", namely, their "eastern experience". 
They are silent concerning the other side of their activities, such as, 
for example, that Heusinger prepared not only the "Barbarossa plan", but 
also the "green", "yellow", "white" and other plans of Hitler's General 
Staff, according to which the first blows were to be directed not against 
the East, but against the West. As for Speidel, this general, with 
"experience" gained in the North Caucasus and the Ukraine, was again 
transferred to France, where he was Chief of Staff of the Western Group 
of Hitler's forces, and Kammhuber, as we have seen, was one of the organ-
izers of the terroristic air attacks against Great Britain. That the 
"eastern experience", has not been forgotten is shown, for example, by 
the following statement made by Strauss, which appeared in the press 
throughout the world: "The road to the German East leads through Paris 
000 
The West German generals proudly tell of their adherence to the 
"old traditions". The traditions of German militarism are well known. 
They consist of preparing aggression everywhere, in Heusinger's words, 
"there is the opportunity". The re-arming of West Germany is creating a 
danger spot again in central Europe which represents a threat to the 
peace and security of all the peoples of Europe. This is why the strug-
41e against the rebirth of German militarism is a struggle for the pres-
ervation of peace in Europe. 
The German militarists are undoubtedly masters of both "eastern" 
and "westerniand various other kinds of experience in launching aggres-
sive wars. But there is one kind of experience which they do not wish 
to take into account. They are stubbornly ignoring the lessons of 
history. However, history moves forward, and today the situation in 
&rope and the whole world is radically different from that in which the 
first and second world wars broke out. And if the militarists are for-
getting this, the peoples understand this very well. The unity of the 
forces for_peace, their solidarity, and the decisiveness of their 
actions is a warranty that the sinister new plans of German militarism 
will end in failure.

Leader of the German Revenge-Seekers A. Galkin 
A man with a stone face and long, equine teeth, casually leaning 
against the railing, stands on the platform and, wearing a tired, bored 
expreasion, watches the ranks marching before him. From time to time he 
phlegmatically raises his hand in response to cries of greeting. His 
face has the contemptuous smile of an important man who is accustomed to 
praise. His black civilian suit fits him closely, like a military uni-
form. 
At the base of the platform, masses of people are milling about. 
Gray uniforms. New squeaking leather straps. Gay cockades. Haughty 
and evil faces. "Hoch!" "Heil!" The Fascist hymn rings out, "Today 
Germany is ours, tomorrow the whole world". Lebensraum! Advances 
What is this? The Fascist putsch of 1923? The burning of the 
Reichstag in 1933? A Nazi meeting in Hitler's Sportpalast? 
No This is 1956. It is the Federal Republic of Germany, a 
routine assembly of the "Steel Helmet". Hitler and Goering are not on 
the platform; they are long since dead. But the man in the black suit 
was their associate. He worked with them to establish the aggressive 
imperialistic Wehrmacht. With them he prepared for war. Now he is again 
an "outstanding personality". He is the honorary president of the "Steel 
Helmet". Over 100,000 soldiers of this union have given him their oath. 
This man's name is Albert Kesselring -- a retired Hitlerite Field 
Marshal. 
The West German neo-Fascists have proclaimed Kesaelring a model 
"German soldier". This doubtful praise did not come to him without rea-
son. Kesselring's path to the "heights" is marked by heaps of corpses. 
Western Europe refers to him with burning and just indignation. When 
they hear his name, the Italians turn white with rage. They well remem-
ber the times when his orders were posted in Rome and Milan, in their 
cities and villages. Their style was laconic: death, death, death. 
Not far from ancient Rome is a grotto of white tufa. At one time, 
tourists liked to visit it. Kesselring's aides made the grotto a place 
of execution. At his order, 335 Italians were shot here. Their "guilt" 
was that they fell into the hands of their executioners. 
There are many such crimes on the conscience of the retired Field 
Marshal: 48 shot in Fondo Toce, 54 hanged at Trieste, 107 inhabitants 
of Valle killed, 560 victims in Santa Anna di Stazzemal 1,830 old men 
and women tortured at Marzabotto. Cruelty was the driving force of his 
career. A professional soldier, he grew up along with the Reichswehr.

It was in the 1920s. The German militarists were secretly rearming. 
The army of professionals was changing into vast armed force. The prep-
arations for the establishment of the German air force was going on. In 
1924, Junkers began the production of military aircraft. In 1925, the 
first military air group was founded under the name "Aerial defense." 
The unscrupulous and unprincipled officer had every means for advance-
ment. He climbed up the steps of a grand career in a majestic march. At 
first he worked together with General von Seeckt. Then the forerunner of 
Hitler, the Fascist general Schleicher, became his chief. Kesselring 
reacted to the Hitler revolution of 1933 with enthusiasm, for the Nazi had 
proclaimed a policy of brute military force and were openly talking about 
revenge. This meant that he would have an opportunity to apply his 
"abilities" ... 
After 1933, Kesselring s advancement proceeded even more successfully. 
The ambitious careerist was supported by his old friend Goering, who found 
himself at the helm of power. "The Fuhrer himself" takes note of him. In 
September 1933, he was still only a colonel. Six years later, he was com-
mander of the First German Air Force, and two years after that he became 
a Field Marshal. 
In his book, "Soldier to the End", Kesselring boasted of the trust 
that Hitler put in him. According to his own words, this trust was 
"wonderful". Hitler had every basis for this. He knew that the careerist 
officer would undertake any crime at his order. 
Kesselring was one of the creators of the theory of total air war. 
The meaning of this theory was explained in an instruction report he re-
leased to his airmen: 
"While circling over the enemy's cities and fields, you must crush 
any feelings you may have within you. You must say to yourselves, 1These 
people are not human beings since this term applies only to Germans.g 
For thePirstGermanfidrFcrcehere are no so-called non-military targets, or 
spiritual motives. Enemy countries must be wiped from the face of the 
earth, and any resistance must be crushed." 
In 1936, Spanish cities became the first subjects of the practical 
application of Kesselring's theory. "This was an excellent opportunity 
for the tactical and technical testing of our air force", the Hitlerite 
Field Marshal cynically wrote later. Then it was the turn of the British 
capital. The aerial armada commanded by Kesselring undertook the "Battle 
of Britain". One of his books includes a photograph from this period: 
Goering and Kesselring are accompanying the first group of aircraft flying 
their deadly freight to London. Both have satisfied grins on their faces. 
"I shall wipe the British cities off the face of the earth," Hitler de-
clared at that time.

During the first months of the war against the Soviet Union, 
Kesselring commanded the air fleet covering the advance of the central 
group of Fascist forces. The direction of the attack of this group was 
Minsk-Smolensk-Moscow. Operating in advance of the movement of the 
Fascist divisions, be sought to convert central Russia into a sea of 
ruins. Kesselring is immediately responsible for the deaths of thousands 
of residents of Minsk during the bombardments of June 1941. It was his 
aircraft that burst Upon Moscow during the grim autumn of the first year 
of the war. 
In October 1941, Hitler moved his favorite still another step for-
ward; he appointed him "Supreme Commander of the Military Forces of the 
South", which amounted in essence to his being Hitler's viceroy in Italy. 
During the remainder of the war, Kesselring was almost the unlimited 
master of the German South. Hut in May, 1945, he surrendered together 
with his troops ... 
May, 1947. Sunny Venice. The ancient law building. On the defend-
ant's, bench --the criminal. 
The British Military Court is trying the former Field Marshal 
Kesselring. The prosecutor is reading a long list of crimes impassively 
and unhurriedly. The defense lawyer tries to fall back on the rights of 
an occupying power. The defendant is silents, gloomily staring at the 
floor. He is afraid that they will see in his look his hatred and scorns, 
and his regret that he did not kill, destroy or torture enough. 
The court solenInly announces the death penalty. It seemed as if 
justice had triumphed and that the criminal had been condemned. 
But in reality mysterious forces behind the scenes stepped in. The 
American authorities protest; Kesselring may be of value to them. Two 
weeks go by. ,egotiatIons take place behind the scenes. Finally, it 
is announced from London that the death penalty has been rescinded. But 
Kesselring is no longer to be free. He will forever sit behind bars. 
In October, 1947, the criminal Field Marshal was put into the prison of 
Werl. 
There are various kinds of prisons: some are better and some are 
worse. The prison where the Field Marshal whiled away his time was a 
sanitarium-prison. The room was sunny, the door opened into a small gar-
den. There were a doctorf, a nurse, a servant and a cook. His food allot-
ment was better than thai, of the average German. Books, newspapers, paper.

The man sentenced to life imprisonment calmly comes and goes as he 
wishes. The future does not disturb him. He can already see the begin-
ning,of the sec9nd stage of his career. Publishing houses in eager 
rivalry propose that he write books. The Bavarian authorities invite him 
to accept a good place in a,government office. And finally the criminal 
is elected the Honorary Praident of the "Steel Helmet". In the first an-
nouncement of the "Steel Helmet", it is stated that Kesselringls name 
should become a "guiding star" in the struggle against the East. While 
still in prisons Kesselring becomes one of the most influential individ-
uals in the Bonn government. 
The "Steel Helmet" is not merely a soldier' organization. It is the 
traditional guard of German imperialists. Established in November 1918, 
by the manufacturer Seldte, it drenched Germany in the blood of workers. 
The shootings of 1918, 1919, 1920 and 1923 were the work of the "Steel 
Helmet". 
In 1929, the "Steel Helmet" joined forces with the German Nazi 
Party. Its military units participated in Hitler's pogroms. Jointly 
with the storm troops, they smashed labor unions and killed democrats. 
Then the "Steel Helmet" was merged with the Nazi military units, and the 
union's leader Seldte became one of Hitler's Reichsministers. 
Reborn in 1951 and lavishly provided with contributions from the 
Ruhr magnates and bankers, the "Steel Helmet" grew like yeast. Its 
membership soon exceeded a hundred thousand. The Schroeder Bank at 
Cologne, the German branch of an Anglo-American banking firm and one of 
the most influential members of the Cologne banking clique, took it 
under its patronage. 
It was clear that the President of a union of this type would not 
stay in prison for long. That is what happened. A few months after 
hie election, Kesselring was free. In his very first speech he called 
for educating West German youth in a soldierly spirit, and demanded the 
establishment of a "regular army of soldiers with war experience in the 
East". 
At one time it was said of the French nobility in exile that they 
had learned nothing and that they had forgotten nothing. Of Kesselring 
it may be said that he learned nothing and is trying to forget every-
thing. He wants to forget the days of surrender, imprisonment, and the 
trial; he also wants to forget the two weeks that he was expecting to 
be executed. He thinks that he can begin over again. 
"Ky future is in my past", he declared cynically to reporters upon 
accepting the position of President of the "Steel Helmet". "Is it worth 
making a fuss over such a trifle as a couple of executed civilians?" he 
said with a smirk when reminded about his atrocities.

"The only thing 'I fear is the rebuke of history that I did not make 
full use of the tactical capabilities of our army because of too great a 
feeling of humanity", he insolently declared at a "Steel Helmet" meeting. 
The present plans of the retired Field Marshal are quite extensive. 
His first goal is the full rebirth of the military might of the war lead-
ers. Kesselring wants the West German Bundeswehr to be established on 
the model and in the likeness of Hitler's Wehrmacht. 
"The true soldier has nothing in 
in uniform", he writes in the leading 
newspaper, Deutsche Soldatenzeitunq. 
recommends Hindenburg, Ludendorff and 
common with the so-called civilian 
organ of the revenge-seekers, the 
As examples of "true soldier," he 
Rommel to the young men. 
"The S. S. division6 had members with the purest German blood. 
Therefore the soldiers of these units should not be ostracized. We ca 
not get along without them in the creation of a new West German force". 
These words were spoken by Albert Kesselring in November 1954, on the 
British television. And two years later, in full accord with his will, 
the doors of the Bundeswehr were opened wide for S. S. officers. 
Kesselring dreams of the day when the aircraft of the German mili-
tarists will again rule the skies of Western Europe. These dreams are 
being brought into reality by his closest associates, who are playing an 
important role in the War Ministry, Lieutenant General Kammhuber, head 
of the Aviation Department, is well known as an admirer of Kesselring. 
The twenty air regiments which are being established in West Germany 
are only the beginning for Kesselring. He well remembers that when 
Goering undertook the rebirth of the "Luftwaffe" he had much fewer planes. 
For the time being, Kesselring has no official duties at Bonn This 
permits him to be completely frank. He talks much about a new war in the 
East. At the same time he gnashes his teeth at the West. In July 1953, 
his union's journal appeared under the heading "We Want a Victory-Over 
France". Not long before, Kesselring wrote in an article on the war in 
the Mediterranean Sea that the sea "remains a longed-for dream for the 
Germans ... since it opens the way to markets." Germany "should not only 
defend itself, but should attack," the ex-Field Marshal frankly stated in 
his book, Thoughts on World War II. "I am certain that Germany's troop 
resources Millreceive due recognition", he said at a regular meeting of 
his supporters in September 1956. 
Of course, it is harder for Kesselring and his associates to act now 
than it was in the past. The bitter experience of Hitler's dictatorship 
had its effect on the majority of the German people. The "Steel Helmet" 
and its ideologists are opposed by millions of active fighters against

Fascism in any form. However, it would be dangerous to fail to see that 
Kesselring and people like him are becoming a substantial force. Over a

ing the ground for a new war and for a bloody revenge.

Master of Black Deeds A. Galkin 
.During the memorable days of 1945, when the nations were rejoicing 
over the end of the bloody war and the liberation of Europe from Fascist 
tyranny; a group of German officers surrendered to an American advance 
unit in Bavaria. In their appearance and conduct they were strikingly 
different from the tens of thousands of their colleagues who were demor-
alized, shabbily dressed and had lost that snappy appearance which 
Wehrmacht officers were once so proud of. These prisoners, carefully 
shaven and in immaculate uniforms, acted as if the defeat of the Hitlerite 
army in which they served had not affected them. The group was headed by 
a lean, balding man in a Lieutenant General's uniform. He immediately de-
manded that the entire group be sent to the staff in charge, since, he 
declared, he and his subordinates could provide the American command with 
information of extraordinary importance. When the General gave his 
name, it made quite an impression. 
General Reinhard Gehlen was well known to the heads of the American 
secret service. In Hitler's General Staff he headed the "Fremde Heere 
Ost" ("Foreign Armies of the East")Department, directed the spy service 
in Eastern Earope, and was one of the greatest masters of espionage in 
Hitler's Reich. 
Here is what the West German newspaper Aachener Nachrichten says 
about this episode: "During the 1945 catastrophe, General Gehlen fled 
to the West, taking extremely important secret documents with him. He 
managed to save many top secret lists of German agents operating in the 
Soviet Union. His ideas made a strong impression upon the heads of the 
American intelligence, as did the materials which he turned over to 
them." 
Gehlen was sent to the United States capital, Washington, in a 
special aircraft. He did not remain there long; when all the plans for 
creating a new spy system at the service of the United States were ap-
proved by the Pentagon, he was brought back to West Germany., 
Thus Gehlen's career of espionage began. He was serving the 
United States of America. "The Americans were delighted with his work, 
and willingly permitted him to increase the number of his workers and 
to expand his sphere of activity," Aachener Nachrichten said. "The 
Americans paid all expenses." 
"Gehlen received much praise both from his American patrons and 
from the Bonn Government for the reliability and accuracy of his 
espionage data" the American journal, New Republic, stated.

At first, the work of the Gehlen "bureau" was directed inwards; the 
American authorities in West Germany needed people working for them in 
all the units of the political, social and administrative system. 
The nature of the work of these people is shown by the admission 
which a British radio commentator once could not help bursting out with; 
he called Gehlen's service "political 4ynamite". "The Gehlen network in 
West Germany is a tremendous hidden force", this commentator wrote. "It 
has confidential agents in all the German government bureaus, in the 
police, the newspapers, the radio stations, the labor unions -- every-
where." 
Soon, however, the tentacles of the Gehlen service reached out beyond 
the boundaries of the FRG -- into the German Democratic Republic and other 
socialist countries. 
After the failure of tae attempts to launch a Fascist putsch against 
the GDR on 17 June 1953, the press of the German Democratic Republic came 
to the unanimous conclusion that these events were the work of the service 
of the American agent Gehlen and was the fruit of their criminal activity. 
This activity was described by Gehlen's agents themselves -- either 
when they failed in their work and were exposed, or repented and gave 
themselves up. 
First a spy network, consisting of hundreds of agents and informers, 
was exposed within the German Democratic Republic. Then came failures 
of agents in Czechoslovakia and Poland. The public of the socialist 
countries exposed their intrigues. Spies who were arrested were suffi-
ciently talkative; they did not feel it was necessary to maintain silence 
concerning their chief's secrets. 
The evidence given by these agents and published in the democratic 
press provided a clear picture, permitting one to judge what the Gehlen 
organization represents. 
Acting as an ally and agent of the most reactionary United States 
circles, the extensive apparatus of the Gehlen espionage and sabotage 
service was organized in the likeness of, and on the same principle as 
Hitler's military intelligence service, "Abwehr". Hitler's general saw 
far into the future; he foresaw a time when his service would become an 
important unit in the system of the German movement for revenge, would 
free itself from American sponsorship and would convert itself from a 
servant and an agent into a partner with equal rights.

How is the Gehlen system set up? The General himself and his closest 
associates make up the "administrative staff", located at a luxurious villa 
at the Starnberger See, not far from Munich. Directives go from here to 
the offices of the Central Administration (general directorate) located at 
Pullach -- a town net far from the capital of Bavaria. 
Like the former Central Administration of the "Abwehr", the General 
Directorate consists .Q the basic branches: First (espionage), Second 
(wrecking and sabotage) and Third (counterintelligence). Each branch is 
sub-divided inte divisions. Thus, the First Branch has a Division of 
Military Espionage (including the Infantry, Naval and Air Sections), a 
Division of Economic Espionage and one of Political Espionage. In addi-
tion, the frame-work of the General Directorate includes a number of 
autoPomo4s auxiliary divisions: operational and administrative ones, 
schools for the preparation of agents, a courier communication service, 
etc. 
,Outlying Chief Branches, located in various Lander, are subordinate 
te the General ,Directorate.. Their structure is completely identical 
with that .g the Genera .rectorate, The next level of the Gehlen 
orgahization consists of the District Branches. The latter have juris-
dictien,over,branches scattered everywhere. The sub-branches deal with 
the chief agents or with groups of agents connected with them. 
The Gehlen service, wrote the American journal New Republic, has 
all the means at its disposal which are known to an intelligence agency 
of werldrwide scope, from petty informers to underground radio transmit-
ters, from secret research laboratories to spy schools and scientific 
centers,in which highly qualified scientists and specialists carefully 
analyse printed materials published in all the languages of the world. 
Of course, not one of the numerous subdivisions of the Gehlen spy 
system calls itself by its true name. They are all camouflaged as 
commi4rOal firms or ind4etrial and economic organizations. Thus, the 
General Directorate at one time presented itself as the "Herzog Company". 
One of the principal branches used to camouflage itself under the name 
nHase Company". The West Berlin Branch, "X/9592" operated as the 
ItNorland Company". The group for the preparation of false documents 
used the conspiratorial name of "Swabian Industrial Representativesn. 
,The namsa ef those who work around Gehlen are kept strictly secret. 
The villa neer Muniph where his "administrative staff" is located is 
surrounded by a barbed-wire fence and is carefully protected by watch-
men. For thirteen years, the General has carefully avoided the lenses 
of a camera. His latest photograph, dug up by indefatigable reporters, 
dates from 1944.

Despite the strict secrecy, some data has gotten into print concern-
ing the personnel of the General's service. It has become known that 
Gehlen has surrounded himself not only with former intelligence agents 
from the General Staff, but with all the scum of Hitler's spy system who 
survived the collapse of the Fascist Reich. He has hired a number of 
workers from the Gestapo, the special purpose units and the S. S. "Reich 
Security Administration". The spy-general's closest adviser is a certain 
Fritz Panzinger, formerly head of the Gestapo in the Baltic Republics 
while they were occupied by the Fascists. The courier service is headed 
by General Kleikamp, former personnel chief of Hitler's General Staff, 
The Chief Branch of the Gehlen organization in Karlsruhe is under the S. 
S. member Leidl. Branch "X/8970" is headed by the Hitlerite spy, Major 
Gartner. 
The basic offices of the Gehlen spy service include 4,000 experts 
on military and political affairs. This does not include the army of 
many thousands of agents scattered in various countries, all the way to 
the Near and Middle East. 
In the spring of 1956, the American authorities transferred 
Gehlen's agency to the West German government. The head of the agency 
received the civil service rank of Ministerial Director; he is now 
subordinate to Chancellor Adenauer through Globke, head of his per-
sonal chancellery. The Bonn budget for the 1956-1957 fiscal year 
earmarked 23,000,000 marks for the maintenance of the Gehlen organiza-
tion. 
While outwardly and formally the Gehlen service is no longer con-
nected with the American authorities, close contact between them is 
doubtless being maintained. 
The Gehlen organization is the most extensive espionage and sabotage 
network operating in West Germany in the interests of the forces seeking 
to block the establishment of confidence in international relations --
namely, the reactionary circles of the western powers and the Germans 
seeking revenge. There is also an Intelligence and Counterintelligence 
Branch under the War Ministry of the Federal Republic of Germany. But 
this espionage organ is merely a subsidiary firm of the Gehlen spy com-
pany. At one time this branch was headed by Lieutenant Colonel Heinz, 
super-spy and saboteur of the "Brandenburg" units of Hitler's "Abwehr". 
He tried to maintain some independence from Gehlen, but these attempts 
only led to his being dismissed at the end of 1953. His successor, 
Major Oster, also showed some obstinacy. Consequently, in the spring of 
the following year an immediate agent of Gehlen's, Lieutenant Colonel 
Wessel, was placed at the head of the Intelligence and Counterintelligence 
Branch of the War Ministry.

Gehlen has also taken into his own hands a third secret service in 
the FRG -- !'the Administration ,for the Protection of the Constitution". 
For a long time the assistant chief of this agency was Radke, a Gehlen 
agent. In 1954, Radke became in reality the chief of the agency and 
since then it has basically been one of the units in the Gehlen network. 
It is known that in West Germany there are many other smaller intel-
ligence agencies and espionage organizations. Espionage and sabotage are 
being carried out by the so-called "Investigative Committee of Free 
Jurists", "The Group for Struggle against Inhumanity", ulhe Consultantsg 
Bureau_for.the Defense of Enterprises," and others. ,The West German 
Mittelhayerische Zeitung has counted tens of intelligence centers in 
'West Berlin alone. If, for the sake of caution, this figure is cut in 
half, it would still be an impressive number. All these spy groups, units 
and centers work for Gehlen and his agency. 
The General Directorate of Gehlen's service also has specialists on 
espionage against the West. The well-informed West German newspaper, 
Westfalische Rundschau, once remarked that "the activity of the bureau 
FM; riF-TETTOT-merGerman officer Gehlen is not directed at the East 
alone." The newspaper had a substantial basis for this statement. Ac-
cording to the admission of the Nazi spy and saboteur Skorzeny, before 
the Fascist forces withdrew in 1944 the German intelligence set up 
secret caches of arms and sabotage equipment all over Western Europe. 
There is reason to believe that the data on these caches are held by 
this Gehlen at the present time. 
It is known that, in the past, Gehlen's representatives were espe-
cially active in recruiting agents among the workers of the administra-
tion of the French High Commissioner in Germany. In Strasbourg, in the 
so-called "Free &rope College", where spies are trained for work in 
countries of the East, the Gehlen service -- under the very noses of the 
French autherities -- organized a group to instruct agents specializing 
in problems of Alsace and Lorraine. According to the West German weekly, 
Deutsche Woche, this service regularly prepares secret summaries on the 
situation in rrarce and Switzerland. 
"Reports have been received," writes the American journal, New 
Republic, "of evidence of increasing activity of the Gehlen organiza-
tion rom such remote places as Hong Kong, Stockholm and Madrid. The 
French were particularly disturbed by reports indicating that Gehlen 
agents were operating in their country." 
New tasks face the Gehlen organization with the inclusion of West 
Germany in North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the creation of a West 
German Army for the purpose of revenge, and the related increase in the 
proportion of German militarists in NATO. The Bonn organizers of this

army so far have not announced openly their goals of obtaining the domi-
nant role in west Europe -- this would be premature and would merely have 
alarmed their present-day West European partners. But in Bonn, quite 
extensive consideration is being given not only to the problem of the 
forceful annexation of the German Democratic Republic, but also, for 
example, to an anschluss with Austria. 
A special Austrian division of the Gehlen service is promoting the 
goals of secret preparation, planned for many years, for an anschluss 
with Austria. This division is called "Slid" (South), and has strongholds 
in Salzburg, Linz, Graz, Klagenfurt and Vienna. As is the case in other 
units of this service, the personnel of the Austrian branch are recruited 
from "specialists" with a Nazi background. One of the leaders of the 
Austrian division is Wilhelm Hoette, formerly an associate of Kaltenbrunner, 
chief of the Gestapo. 
In particular activity was shown by the Gehlen German-American espio-
nage network in Austria during the counterrevolutionary putsch of the 
Horthyite underground in Hungary. Austria became a transfer point for the 
deployment of persons and armaments to support the armed action against 
the popular democratic system in Hungary. The Gehlen service, operating 
in close contact with the United States intelligence, undertook to organ-
ize this deployment jointly with other imperialistic intelligence agencies. 
In West Germany people speak openly of Gehlen's participation in the 
events in Hungary. It was this agency that sent hand grenades disguised 
as canned goods from the Federal Republic of Germany to Hungary. 
The White Book of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary 
Government also mentions the sinister role of the Gehlen service in the 
preparation and execution of the counterrevolutionary putsch in Hungary; 
this book exposes the dark activities of foreign imperialistic spy serv-
ices. Even the American newspaper, New York World Telegram and Sun, 
citing informed diplomatic circles, acknowledged that the Gehlen intel-
ligence service played a significant role in the putsch in Hungary. 
000 The foreign press, seeking to create an air of mystery around 
Gehlen, called him a "man without a face". This, at the very least, is 
not exactly accurate. Gehlen and his bosses have a face. It is the face 
of the German striving for revenge; its savage fangs are well known to 
millions of people from the quite recent past.

Shadow Over Eurone  
N. Gribachev 
The western propaganda sextons are swinging their censers of ink, 
driving away the devils of doubt, while the godfathers and nursemaids of 
"Euratom," "Eurafrica," "the European Common Markets and other prodigal 
sons of a prodigal policy are lobbying in their parliaments to have the 
christening take place with due decorum and particularly without any 
special noise from the street. Everyone is so busy with this that even 
the thin flow of news from the Bermuda Islands, insipid as it is, is 
smeared over the newspapers without the usnAl affectation and official 
optimism. What is the matter? 
Hans Speidel, the Hitler general who has collected lumps on his 
forehead in the Caucasus, Voronezh and Belgorod, is being seated in the 
saddle as Commander-in-Chief of NATO Infantry Forces in central Europe 
and is riding into Paris on the black horse of American policy toward 
Europe. Tomorrow he will pick up the reins and pull on them2 he will 
assume adignified air, and the French and British soldiers, officers 
and generals will march off under their new command 'Erns, zwei2 
drei...." The goose-step for the proud Britons, the barracks at Bonn 
for the freedom-loving Gauls. The ghosts of all the generations of 
German militarists are crawling out on their tombstones, giggling and 
clapping their hands; the new players and the living seekers of revenge 
are Snatching a tremendous military and political prize at the cost of 
the fall and belittling of British and French authority. 
Row can it be any different, if yesterday's loser is giving orders 
to the victors, if no general remotely suitable can be found to command 
their own troops among the British or French who produced Nelson and 
Napoleon, or if, speaking metaphorically, the Bonn goat Hans Speidel has 
been appokm4ed to guard the garden of British and French interests. True, 
all this took place amid the agitation and angry protests of workers, 
especiPlly the young ones, who must now serve under the command of the 
murderer of their fathers, brothers and fellow-citizens. But Speidel 
himself, as reported by the British journal Picture Post is ignoring 
this indignation with Swabian arrogance, and the British and French 
statesmet have transoceanic blinkers over their eyes and have the tan-
gled cotton of Dulles promises stuffed into their ears. 
It would be naive to think that history decided to exalt Hans 
Speidel for his military genius; history cannot find anything like such 
genius in his biography, even if it should undertake to examine it 
through a Zeiss microscope. It would also be ridiculous to assume that 
Speidel, who on two occasions, the first and second world wars, fired 
at the French and British and was loaded down with medals by the Kaiser 
and.by Hitler for this, has wept a tear of sorrow and has decided to de-
vote the remainder of his life to a lofty aim, i.e., organizing a well-
to-do life in the militaristic jungles for the French Little Red Riding 
Hood and the aged British lion.

The appointment of Hans Speidel? if one arrives at the essence of 
it and discards the camouflaging phraseology, is the beginning of a new 
game of war between Bonn and Washington, a game in which the troops of 
the allies in the bloc are called upon to play the role of chess pieces. 
Speidel turned out to be a suitable nomination for the position of com-
mander just because of his ability in playing, in conducting and weaving 
intrigues and in putting others into jeopardy. It is no coincidence that 
the journal Der Spiegel wrote, describing him: "His smooth cunning and 
elegant deftness make him resemble rather a smart business operator accus-
tomed to success." And if anyone assumes that Speidel the nationalist 
will use these abilities to the disadvantage of Bonn and Speidel the 
revenge-seeker will use them to the disadvantage of Washington, to which 
he is tied with only one string, such an optimist should have his tempera-
ture taken and told to see a doctor; he has the Atlantic fever with a loes 
of the normal feeling for time and the surroundings. 
liana Speidel, the son of a forester, was born in the idyllic village 
of Metzingen, from which one may conclude that nature is not always con-
sistent; the offspring resembled neither his father nor his mother, but 
turned Out to be a Prussian youth. When World War I began, Hans Speidel 
wa$ still sitting on a school bench, but soon got away into the field 
army with the rank of a Junker; he understood that in the muddy waters 
of chauvinistic intoxication and war one could, with some skill, make a 
good career for himself. That is what happened g he fought at Verdun, 
on the Somme and the Maas as commander of a squad, platoon, and company, 
and got away from the defeat as a regimental adjutant with crosses and 
medals, but no wounds. His fellow officers found in him evidence of 
great flexibility, not noting or noticing any other talents. Then things 
went badly, the defeated army changed from one of many millione to one 
of only a hundred thousand, leaving its haughtiness and gilt behind on 
the fields of France and Russia. Then Speidel enrolled in courses on 
history and economics at the University of Berlin and was awarded a 
Doctorate in Philosophy cum laude at the University of Tabingen. 
By the way, his dissertation, "1813-1924; a Military and Political 
Study" resembled a philosophical work as muth as barracks language re-
sembles Goethevs poetry. "The cause of revolution is not in moral 
strength, but in moral weakness, in the weakness of the people and the 
government," wrote this new Panglose in lieutenant tls shoulderatraps, 
unable to tell a goat from a cat-tail and assuming with the naivete of 
a Junker that the world is ruled by a corporal's baton. "Into the 
breaches made by the revolution, political parties flow in," these 
"crowds of parasites on the body of the empire," he stated with the 
naivete of a kindergarten student, mixing his fantasies with those of 
Oswald Spengler and not understanding that every empire carries revolu-
tion around in itself, and that political parties, depending on their 
claa$ nature, either help in the birth or else sffiother the new-born

child. No one knows how much longer Hans Speidel would have played with 
his philosophical toys and rattles and have sipped beer in the Ludwigsburg 
Casino if the Reichatag had not burst into flames and if Hitler had not 
slammed the door in the face of the International Conference on Disarma-
ment in 19,3, Without making a wry face and without spitting? the "Doctor 
of Philosophy" swallowed his statements that parties are "crowds of para-
sites on the body of the empire" and went off to serve Naziism. Then he 
made his first entry into Paris as an Assistant Military Attacher; he rep-
resented and personified, on the international scene, German militariza-
tion, which led to the torch-lit orgies of the S.S.; the pogroms, the 
concentration camps, the fall of Paris and the ruins of Coventry. A 
amall,bolt in a vast machine, Hans Speidel, urbane; self-assured and 
crafty, was casting a large shadow of future calamities and misfortunes. 
Speidel found himself in Paris a second time when Beck, Chief of 
Hitler's General Staff, made a visit to his French colleague Gamelin. 
This was a ceremonial bow before the dagger thrust. Then the war began. 
Hans Speidel became a first officer of the General Staff, and a year and 
a half later again, arrived in Paris a third time in order to propose to 
the French general Dentz that he surrender the city without fighting. 
He accompanied Hitler throughout conquered Paris to Napoleon's sarcophagus, 
and in gratitude the frenzied Fuhrer appointed Speidel Chief of Staff to 
the ComMander of the Occupation Troops in France. 
Thu, every appearance of this "Doctor of Philosophy" in Paris led 
?to sinister consequences for France. The urbane speeches of Hans Speidel 
always turned out to be the howl of a dog at a fire. But at that time

It 41.10t be Said that Hans Speidel conducted himself circumspectly, 
leaving himself a way out in case the time came to settle scores. He 
never protested against the mass executions of French patriots and hos-
tages, but he never put hi a signature on orders for executions unless it 
was next to that of Keitel, Chief of the General Staff. This was a shadow 
which left no traces,' Quietly, wearing rubber soles of caution, he passed 
through the generals plot against Hitler which was then beginning to take 
shapes. At Rommel's request, he established contact with von Neurath for 
this purpose, brought Rommel himself together with the military commandant 
of Paris, StUlpnagel? and conducted negotiations with Field Marshal von 
Kluge. 
And what happened? 
Kluge was forced to shoot himself, Rommel took poison, and Strapnagel 
was hanged. This was the cost of words and intentions which were not fol-
lowed by action. And what about Hans Speidel? He helped to tie and tighten

the noose around the necks of his commanding officers, but when the decisive 
moment came he managed to scramble to the side of the road. When Stillpnagel? 
arriving from Paris, advised Kluge to surrender, to throw open the front on 
the West, and at the same time launch a revolt against Hitler, Kluge was 
hesitant: "Yes, if only the swine were dead." Smelling the odor of a soap 
covered rope here, Hans Speidel wisely left during this conversation, and 
later told the Gestapo: At that time I was in my office and was directing 
military operations." It wasnot I, the horse was not mine.... 
Such is Hans Speidel -- a mixture of the idyl of Metzingen with Prus-
sianism, of a home-grown philosopher and an elegant nightingale with the 
fox. He is the idol of the Philistines, who value resourcefulness more 
than anything, along with the ability to create a career regardless of what 
one has to offer, and he represents very mediocre human material from the 
point of view of sound judgment. And to the extent that NATO is not only 
a military instrument but even more a political one -- a transoceanic mas-
ter key to the independence, sovereignty and the economic positions of the 
West European countries -- to this extent Hans is fully suitable for the 
Americans. Evidently, Washington decided that the English and the French 
are making the farewell to their glorious past unduly complicated and drawn 
out; Hans Speidel will be able to make it shorter. 
Of course, the British and the French would never have invented such 
a plan themselves; it was the creation of their "senior partner." No one 
in the world doubts that the Anglo-French team is playing in this big 
political soccer match at Dulles' whistle and under the direction of Wash-
ington trainers. But having scored behind their awn goal-line, the west 
European politicians are seeking to present this as a defense of their 
own national interests -- to call a pig a carp -- and simultaneously, to 
calm public opinion, they declare the innocence of Hans Speidel, painting 
him as a poor blond Gretchen, deprived of her innocence by the mischievous 
Adolf Hitler. It is true that at the end of the war, when everything col-
lapsed and the fragments of the third Reich were tumbling down upon the 
heads of its creators and builders, Hans Speidel was in prison, where, in 
the seemly company of people like him, he drank wine, smoked expensive 
cigars and delivered speeches heretical to the Gestapo, and, during pauses 
in these activities, would wash off the blood of Voronezh and Belgorod 
collective farmers and French partisans and patriots. Even the British 
and French lawyers are not so naive as to believe seriously that Speidel 
and Hitler had any ideological differences at that time; the General 
merely jumped overboard when he felt that the ship of the Reich, with 
its insane captain, was sinking. The same course of action, as is well 
known, is followed under similar circumstances by rats, but no one would 
assign them lofty political motives for doing this. 
Rather, the truth is at hand and simple.

The appointment of Hans Speidel was an act of surrender of Anglo-
French policy to the Bonn-Washington axis. This old lady, the "tradi-
tional" Anglo-French policy, is so sick with fear of Communism that in 
her illness she no longer feels what a. heavy hand her gray hairs are 
being wound around. She is till fussing and withering in the Middle 
East, not noticing that her sight is poor and that a new tenant is try-
ing to move in upon her sphere of influence with the aplomb of an in-
ternational Ostap Bender; she is enthusiastically murmuring the newly-
born word "Eurafrical" not realizing that it is merely a password to 
let new colonizers pass the old French sentry posts. As soon as Hans 
Speidel becomes seated more comfortably in his lofty chair in Paris, 
one can speak in plain terms of how Anglo-French influence is fading 
and waning throughout the world and how Anglo-French interests and aims 
are falling underneath the steam-roller of the German desire for re-
ven e. Whenever Speidel has appeared in Paris, he has personified and 
? tiled German aggression in the West, and it would be foolish for 
the French to lull themselves with the hope that, in the present inter-
national climate, tea roses will be raised from nettle seeds. As ye 
sow, SO Shall ye reap. All the more so, since the plan which Speidel 
is to Put into effect now will be worked out at MATO General Headquar-
ters with the participation of the Hitlerite General Heusinger. This 
circle of Hitlerite generals around the West os military command is not 
yet complete, but it is significant that additional links are being 
forged in it one by one. 
And what is Washington counting uon in this situation? 
There it is assumed that a "position of strength" policy will best 
protect all the various monopolistic interests of the United States in 
the world today, and this policy is proceeding in two directions. One 
direction is that Pursued bY the United States in regard to its British, 
French and other partners, this phase being more effective and profitable. 
The other is directed, jointly with the defeated partners!, against the 
countries of the socialist camp, although this phase does not justify 
its expense, since there have not been any lambs for a long time which 
have desired to be shorn in this area. Waahingtonvs best assistant in 
these matters seems to be Bonn; here too the plans are belomIng moth-
emten and the Shears are being sharpened. Washington has to pay some-
thing for this, although at first not out of its own funds; the Ameri-
cans assume that the mildest lambs are grazing on the banks of the Seine 
and the ThamesvQ.. 
Thus the German hireling generals are making their appearance in 
the big international arena, and the British and French politicans are 
throwing under their feet the interests of their own peoples and the 
prestige of nations. Recently, after having boarded the American cruiser 
"Boston," Hans Speidel expressed the hope that it is not yet too late to 
create a "united Europe." Here everything is significant -- the place, 
the speaker, and the text.

FRANCE 
,"France seems weak and in decline only 
because of the policy of renouncing its na-
tional rights, a policy which its 'European' 
and,!Atlantiel governments are carrying out 
in all fields." -- M. Thorez 
Politics and Profits N, Molchanov 
In Paris, under the shelter of the Arch of Triumph, lies a heavy 
brass plate on the grave of the unknown soldier. An eternal flame burns 
here day and night. This place is sacred to every French patriot. 
Official ceremonies take place here. Almost always wreaths lie on the 
grave -- a monument to the courage of the nameless heroes of France. 
This monument is a symbol of the heroic and tragic history of France. 
During the last two centuries she has suffered more from war than any 
other west European country. France has undergone the invasion of Ger-
man troops three times. The invaderls heel has repeatedly trampled upon 
the soil of Paris after capture by aggressors,. During the First and 
Second World Wars, France suffered great looses. While the United States 
lost 245,000 dead during the second world war and Great Britain 325,000, 
France lost 802,000. Here in nearly every city and village rise memor-
ials to the dead of these two world-wide massacres. 
The majority of Frenchmen hate war and ardently desire peace. How 
are the rulers of France translating this sacred desire into reality? 
The country was still healing its wounds from World War II when it was 
drawn into the aggressive military blocs of the western powers. While 
rusty war scrap was still being gathered from the former battlefields, 
the ruling circles of France started a new armaments race. France be-
came one of the active advocates and participants in the aggressive 
policy of force followed by the United States government. How could it 
happen that 43,000,000 Frenchmen, who had suffered so much from war,

found themselves again prisoners of an adventurist policy which threat-
ened them with new and more frightful calamities? Who in France needed 
_ . 
war? 
To the misfortune ot the French, the post-war policy of their coun-
try, as before, proved to be under the definite influence of the forces, 
behind the scenes which had repeatedly driven it into military adventures. 
Several decades ago these forces were vaguely termed the "money wall," 
in the 1930us they began to call them more concretely the "200 families"; 
now they are known with complete precision under the official title of 
the National Council of French Management (NSFP). The French newspapers 
often refer to it by the short word, sounding like the dull crack of a 
rifle, natronat. 
Of course, in France there are no special laws assigning decisive 
power over its government activities and policies to the representatives 
of the financial and industrial oligarchy. Ingenuity and cleverness has 
been used in masking Francens subordination to monopoly capital, which 
has gained huge profits from wars and preparations for war. The public 
is far from knowing everything. Nevertheless, information published at 
various times in the foreign press reveal the sinister role of the French 
financial and industrial magnates. 
The National Council of French Management is the secret but the real 
ruler of Fiance., "While Parliament is divided into numerous factions,"_ 
wrote the American journal United Nations World,, "the NSFP pursues its 
goals with a nn.i'ty'Ofpurpose which?, to use the words of one deputy,. 
'would have been admirable if its goals were more admirable.' 
The NM ii an organization uniting the French employers and is the 
only organization authorized to represent them all. The National Council 
of French Management has its "private" cabinet with some resemblance to 
the ministries of economics, labor, and foreign affairs. It has a bicam-
eral epaliaie?t1 a committee of 120 directors which meets once a month, 
and i general assembly of 500 members which meets annUally. 
The president of the organization is that noted representative of 
the French monopolies, Georges Villiers. He heads the Council,, consist-
ing of twenty-two directors representing the largest monopolies in the 
country. This Council, which the French press calls the "real govern-
ment" of -h.ance, meets once or twice a week in the headquarters of the 
NSF? on Pierre I de Serbie Street in Paris. The following fact elo-
quently describes Georges Villiers' political complexion. In 19429 the 
Vichy governMent appointed him mayor of Lyons in place of Eduerd Herriot, 
who was thrown Into a concentration camp.

A000rdirg to the American press, the NSFP has a "secret fund," amount-
ing to ten or twelve billion francs. It is raised from the contributions 
of big industrialists. The majority of French bourgeois parties draw their 
funds from this "secret fund." At first the principal recipients were the 
Republican Peopleos Movement (MRP) and the socialists; then the radicals 
enjoyed the generosity of the fund, and since 1951 a large part of its 
money has gone, in addition to the MRP, to the extreme rightist political 
groups (the "independents," the "moderates," etc.). The fund is managed 
by the "Office of Administrative and Economic Research" (Paris, 3 rue de 
Penthivre). It is known, for example, that during one of the recent 
electoral campaigns more than a hundred right-wing deputies received a 
billion francs from the "secret fund." 
The French patronat has its henchmen in all the bourgeois political 
parties, in Parliament and in the government. 
One of the most influential bourgeois parties in France is the 
Radical Party. Among its leaders are representatives of the largest 
banks and industrial firms. Here are some of them: Rend' Mayer? repre-
sentative of the Rothschild group and former president of the large bank 
Banque Rothschild Freres. He participates in the management of over 
twenty large trusts and insurance societies. Rend Mayer held minister-
ial posts in several post-war governments. Henri Queuille is the repre-
sentative of the Durand Electric Engineering Trust. He has been a min-
ister and prime minister several times. Bour&s-Maunoury is the general 
manager of the armament-manufacturing Marrel Frk.es Company, which is 
connected with the banking house of Mirabaud; he was Minister of National 
Defense in the Guy Mollet government and a minister in a number of earlier 
governments. In 1957 he was even Prime Minister. Senator Borgeaud is a 
member of the boards of directors of several mining and industrial com-
panies, part of whose capital is invested in North Africa. 
A leading role in the political life of post-war France is played 
by the Catholic party, MRP. The connections of the leaders of this 
party, which promotes an extremely reactionary and militaristic policy, 
are also very typical. The president of the party until 1953 was Maurice 
Schumann, closely linked with the large French banks and with American 
capital. Robert Schuman, who was Minister of Foreign Affairs for many 
years and twice occupied the post of Prime Minister, is close to the 
Franco-German industrialist family of de Wendel. With the assistance of 
Francois de Wendel, Schuman was first elected to Parliament in 1919. He 
was a member of the Vichy government. One should also mention such well-
known figures in the MRP as Andrd'Debr4, one of the directors of the 
Paris-Netherlands Bank; Jean Letourneau, one of the owners of the coal 
mines in Morocco and allied with American banks, and who was Minister of 
the Annexed Territories from 1949 to 1953; and Pierre de Chevigny? rep-
resentative of the Mirabaud Bank.

At the extreme right of the reactionary political parties are the 
so-called "independents.? The capital belonging to the president of the 
National Congress of this party, Roger Duchet, is invested in industrial 
enterprises in the French colonies. One of the independent leaders, the 
former Prime Minister, Joseph Laniels is a big industrialist) a leading 
textile manufaeturer and is allied closely with electric engineering 
firms. Antoine Pinay? Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, 
is a big leather manufacturer. A typical detail %' when Pinay became 
Prime Minister in 1955, the price of leather went up by fifty percent. 
Among the moderates is the so-called Peasants Party. The president 
of the party is Paul Antier? a large land-owner. In 1940 he was among 
those who urged turning power over to P4tain. 
There are also a number of representatives of banks and industrial 
companies in the Social Republican party (De Gaullists). One of its out-
standing figures s Pierre de Gaulle, brother of General Charles de Gaulle, 
is the President of the Union Parisibnne Bank, closely allied with the 
Schneider Armaments Company. General Chaban-Delmas has very close links 
with large publishing and book-trade firms. 
We have named here only the better known of the French politicians, 
who are playing a prominent role in parliamentary and political life. 
We should add to them numerous less known direct representatives of the 
monopolies who have seized the government machinery of the French Repub-
lic. Among the responsible officials of the French Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs are many financiers and industrialists. Once the general secre-
tary of the Ministry was even Francois Charles-Roux, the chairman of the 
board of the notorious Suez Canal Company. The chairman of the board of 
the French branch of the Bence di Homes Jules Laroche) has long been one 
of the leading figures in French diplomacy, DvOrmesson, the Ambassador 
to the Vatican, is a close relative of the big bankers, SeillAre. Henri 
Franvois-Poncet? until recently the French Supreme Commissioner in West 
Germany) is a brother of the general manager of one of the trusts in the 
de Wendel group. The representative of FranT,e in the NATO Council, Herv4 
Alphand, Ambassador to the United Statess is closely allied with the heavy 
industry magnates. 
This list could be continued further. But the examples already given 
are sufficient to convince one that the French menopolies hold in their 
hands the principal levers in the French political manhine. In addition 
to direct personal representation, there are many other indirect ways of 
making the government subordinate to monopoly capital. 
That is the policy which these rulers of France are foisting upon 
the country? In the area of internal affeirs, it amounts to protecting 
the interests of the monopolies, preserving high prices and low wages, 
280

and continuously attacking the economic and political rights of the workers. 
In the area of foreign policy, it is orientation upon the United States as 
a principal bulwark in the struggle against democratic forces and the prepa-
ration for a new war. And all is subordinate to an unbridled pursuit of 
profits "If it were possible to purchase all of France, they would buy 
France from France itself" -- this remark of Cardinal Richelieu concerning 
the French court aristocracy of his time could not fit the present policy 
of the NSFPRs leaders more aptly. 
The hidden activity and the real role of the French financial and 
industrial bosses is no secret to many Frenchmen. The Catholic writer 
Francois Mauriac has stated that the NSFP representatives "watch the 
voting in Parliament from the public balconies." The deputies of the 
bourgeois parties know that their masters are observing their every word 
and their every vote. In June 1953, the former President of France, 
Vincent Auriol, said concerning the patronatos activities: *Our democ-
racy will degenerate into anarchy if it does not defend the interests of 
society from the coalition of egoism and cupidity which is trying to in-
fluence the French Parliament by such methods, as shameless as they are 
scandalous." 
This influence was the principal reason that French foreign policy 
has been subordinate to the interests of the United States since 1947. 
The French monopolists, frightened by the growth of the democratic forces 
after the war, in order to preserve their profits, privileges and power, 
decided to rely-upon a more powerful foreign imperialism, thereby placing 
themselves in a relatively dependent position. The French economist, 
Henri Claude, in his book The Monopolies Against the  Nation, published 
in 1956, writes % "Financial capital bears the responsibility for the 
anti-national policy which has been followed since 1947. It was this 
capital that sold national independence for dollars, traded in Frances 
security, mortgaged the future of the nation, speculated in the very 
destruction of the French people, and drove to its extreme limits the 
policy of treason to the nation by preparing an atomic war; it is this 
capital that represents the most anti-national part of the bourgeoisie." 
In 1948, France signed a treaty with the United States on the 
"Marshall Plan." By this treaty, France, in granting the United States 
the right to interfere in its economic and financial affairs, began in 
fact to follow a foreign policy corresponding to the requirements of 
the State Department of the United States. In return, it received 
American financial and economic "aid." The American credits and "gifts" 
turned out to be in the hands of the large French monopolies. The 
largest part was received by the large trusts: "USINOR?" "Sollac," 
"Ugine," "Schneider at Cie," and others. The "Marshall Plan" was a 
strong support to the French monopolies, but it undermined French 
sovereignty and foisted American policy upon it. The participation of

France in the "Marshall Plan" was a clear example of the utilization of 
the French government in the interest of the enrichment of the monopo-
lists and to the harm of the true interests of the workers. 
In April 19494 France entered the aggressive North Atlantic Union. 
This action drew her into the armaments race) foisted an aggressive 
foreign policy upon her, and considerably increased her dependence upon 
the United States, American troops were deployed upon French territory, 
and extensive construction began of American airfields, military storage 
facilities and other establishments. Forty Atlantic, Organization air-
fields were built in France, and 50,000 American officers and men were 
deployed there. The French people were saddled with the heavy load of 
vast military expenditures which, according to official, minimized data, 
grew in France from 231 -billion francs in 1947 to 1,368 billion in 1956, 
or more than six-fold. 
But while the "Atlantic" pOlicy of Franc&a, governments has caused 
and is continuing to cause great harm to the national interests of the 
country, this policy is bringing enormous profits to the French monopolies. 
After 1952, actual military expenditures amounted to between 1,,800-1,900 
billion francs annually, or nearly half of the entire budget. Out of 
this sum, according to French economists, between 1)100-1,200 billion 
francs are spent for military orders placed with the most powerful trusts, 
which make enormous profits from them. This is why the militarization of 
the French economy and the policy of preparing for a new war is extremely 
profitable for the financial and industrial oligarchy. 
A state of war hysteria is also needed by the monopolistic circles 
to reduce the standard of living of the working class. 
After the American handouts under the "Marshall Plan" came to an 
end, the French monopolies began to receive large sums within the frame-
work of the North Atlantic Organization on the basis of the so-called 
"mutual security" system. American military orders with French military 
companies grew from 818 billion francs in 2952 to 1272 billion in 1954. 
These orders brought in enormous profits to such large trusts as "Forges 
et ateliers du Crausot," "Brandt," "Tomson Houstonso' 4Dassault," and 
others. 
Official French propaganda, seeking to conceal such facts is strenu-
ously attempting to justify the "Atlantic policy?" the policy of war, on 
the basis of the supposed "threat of attack." by the Soviet Union. Still, 
the Soviet Unions sincere love for peace is now acknowledged even by 
people who have views far from those of the Communists.

A typical example of the complete disregard for the national interests 
and open betrayal of them is to be found in the history of the powerful 
family of French heavy industry magnates -- the de Wendels. Their ances-
tors came from Germany. In 1704, one of them acviTed metallurgical enter-
prises in Hayange on French territory. In the next generationy the de 
Wendels established factories in Charlevilley Tulle, and Le Creusot. As 
a result of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, Lorraine was annexed to Ger-
many, placing part of the de Wendel enterprises in a different country. 
Adrien de Wendel then exchanged his French citizenship for a German one. 
Two great de Wendel firms were established, the French one and the German 
one. Preparations for World War I permitted both to obtain enormous 
profits from armament production. Deputy de Wendel was in the French 
Parliament; his cousin sat in the Reichstag. The War of 1914-1918 did 
not break thefamily ties of the de Wendels and the von Wendels. This 
is shown by the following remarkable fact. The German Armyy, at the very 
beginning of the wary occupied the de Wendel factories in the Briey valley. 
These factories provided considerable assistance to Germany during the war. 
And while they were located within range of the French artillery, the troops 
were given the strictest orders not to fire at these factories. 
The de Wendels also acquired wealth during World War II. When Hitler 
occupied France, Frangois de Wendel sent him a letter in Which he assured 
him of-his loyalty and promised him frill support. 
At present, the de Wendel enterprises are operating at full capacity. 
Their annual turnover amounts to 80 billion francs. The armaments rape 
is bringing them enormous profits both in France and in Western GermallY. 
In France, the de Wendels are called the "family of turncoats, !' that is, 
people without a country, going over to the side more valuable to them. 
Less important "turncoats" also exist, and maw- of them can be found among 
the magnates of French monopoly capital. 
* * * 
With great power concentrated In their hands, the French monopolies 
are shamelessly using the French government for their own mercenary in-
terests, This is convincingly demonstrated if one examines closely the 
basis of French foreign policy. 
The German problem occupies a leading place in French foreign policy. 
After World War II, the French people determined to prevent a rebirth of 
German militarism. But only five years later France had in principle 
agreed to the restoration of the armed forces of West Germany. In 1954, 
its representatives signed the Paris treaties on the rebirth of the 
Wehrmacht. How is this line in French foreign policy explained? The 
facts show irrefutably that the leading role in this reversal was played 
by the mercenary interests of French monopolistic capital.

The French monopolies have considerable investments in West German 
industry. Conversion of this industry to military production promised 
them vast profits. During the Hitlerite occupation of France, the Frenda 
metallurgical magnates raked in enormous profits from armament production 
\for the German Army. With the aid of the Paris treaties, they decided 
to bring back those happy times. 
But, in addition to the desire to profit from armament production 
for the West German Army, the French monopolies are guided by another 
consideration which is no le os important for them. They expect that 
they will be able to compete with the West German monopolists in the 
international markets; after all, much of the latteras efforts will be 
directed toward rearming West Germany. he French 'newspaperman Albert-
Paul Lentin wrote in January, 1955: "French big capital regards the 
Paris treaties as Corresponding to their interests on the whole, and 
has therefore decided to support them and to sway in this direction the 
French parliamentary deputies who are under their influence, especially 
the moderates; it decided to do everything possible to build up a solid , 
parliamentary majority to secure the ratification of these treaties." 
:This is why the news that the Paris conference had signed a treaty 
on the rearMing.of West Germany caused, on 24 October 1954, a significant 
rise in the stocks of the war industry monopolies on the Paris Bourse; 
as well as on the New York and London 'exchanges. 
Of course, France agreed to the arming of West Germany under the 
press4re of the American ruling circles, capitalizing on the search of 
the French monopolies for new sources of enrichment. 
In this connection, the post-war history of the Saar problem is 
typical. The Saar Region is small in area and popu1ation0 but its eco-
nomic potential is very large. The Saar annually produces 3,0000000 
tons of steel and 17,000,000 tons of coal. After the war, the French 
monopolies opened a vigorous struggle for the annexation of the Saar to 
France. The United States and Great Britain supported Frances claims 
to the Saar, demanding in return French support for the policy of re-
militarizing West Germany. The French monopolies took over the economy 
of the Saar and acquired enormous profits thereby. Butafter having 
obtained the agreement of the French rulers to the arming of West Ger-
many, the United States reversed its position: the Saar was again re-
turned to West Germany. Without concealing their intentions to seek 
revenge, the German militarists are building up their forces. 
French colonial policy is also subordinate to the mercenary in-
terests of the French monopolies. After World War II? the French 
governments have been waging, colonial wars actually without interrup-
tion. The "dirty war" in Indo-China dragged on for eight years. From

the beginning to the end, it was a war in the interests of the French 
financial oligarchy. The net profits of twenty-five large French com-
panies whose operations were connected with Indo-China almost doubled 
over a short period. Although the United States "aided" the French 
monopolists with dollars in waging the war, more than twice the amount 
was spent on it as was received by France under the "Marshall Plan." 
In 1956, war broke out in Algeria? France concentrated over 400,000 
troops here. Each day of the war has cost the French people a billion 
francs and numerous lives. And all this was done to increase the profits 
of the French monopolists, who are interested in maintaining colonial 
rule in Algeria. Algeria is the largest consumer of French industrial 
production. It has second place in French imports. In 1953, exports 
from Algeria amounted to 107 billion francs. 
Every facet of French foreign policy reflects the interests of the 
French monopoly capital which determines .it. Let us take, for examples 
the plan to create a "European Union" of six countries -- France, West 
Germanys Italy, and the three Benelux countries, envisaging a gradual 
merger of various branches of their economy, armed forces and finsily 
the countries thempQlves into a "supergovernment." The "European Coal 
and Steel Community" has existed for several years. In 1955, the sup-
'porters of a "united Europe" intensified their activity again. There 
was talk of establishing a "common market" and of merging atomic indus-
try. Both these plans have the same political goal: strengthening and 
unifying the closed military and political union of West European coun-
tries? But they are represented as being a means of achieving economic 
prosperity and progress. 
The authors of the plan for a "common market" claim, in particular, 
that the markets of the six countries will be merged into one by the 
abolition of customs. There is to be free competition. This will cause 
a quick reduction in prices, from which the consumer supposedly would 
benefit. 
In reality, the policy of free trade wills as it always has in the 
pasts establish the domination of the most powerful monopolies and will 
destroy the small enterprises which are unable to compete The victor-
ious menopoliess as experience has shown, will then dictate monopoly 
prices. 
But the situation is even more serious if one takes into account 
the economic situation in each country. And here one should first con-
sider France. The point is that French industry as a whole is less 
profitable than, for example, that of West Germany; French goods are, 
as a rule, more expensive than West German ones. As a result of his 
stubborn struggle, the French worker has won higher wages and better 
social welfare than the worker in West Germany or in Italy.

What will happen when a "common market" is established? The weaker 
enterprises will be unable to withstand the pressure of their competitors 
and will go out of business. Wide-spread unemployment will result. 
The owners of the enterprises which survive, seeking to lower the 
prices for their products, will begin to reduce wages and to increase 
the exploitation of the workers. The French economy will undergo a ser-
ious disturbance and will fall into decline and chaos. Who will gain 
from this? It will be the monopolies of West Germany, which are sounder 
economically. The "common market" will enable them to establish an undi-
vided domination over West Europe. "The German exporters," writes the 
French newspaper Information, "have every reason to welcome the estab-
lishment of a common marketog As for France, the 'common marketg is a 
deathly danger." a 
Why then do the ruling circles of France insist upon the establish-
ment of a. "common market"? Here also the decisive role is played by the 
interests of the French financial and industrial monopolies. It is true 
that the plan for a common market is opposed by certain businessmen in 
the light, chemical and machine-building industries. But the influential 
iron and steel monopolies, which are already participating in the "European 
Coal and Steel Community" and which have nothing to lose from a further 
"liberalization" of French foreign trade, are fighting for the establish-
ment of a common market. With the aid of the "common market," the leading 
financial and industrial monopolies in France hope to strengthen their 
position in the world market. They will strive for price reductions on 
their products by means of reducing wages and wiping out the social gains 
of the workers. 
A serious threat to the national interests of France is also repre-
sented by the atomic industry merger -- "Euratom.* In the opinion of a 
French journal? France will become "the first victim of Euratom." 
France has gone far ahead of the other participants in the develop-
ment of atomic industry. It has large reserves of fissionable materials, 
is conducting considerable research, and has built an atomic electric 
power station. Since "Euratom" is an organization of a, "national" nature, 
it is threatening to violate French sovereignty in such an important field 
as the atomic industry. The participation of France in "Euratom" will 
increase her dependence upon the United States, since it will be under 
American control. The atomic "pool" (that is, a "pot used in common"), 
will give the German militarists the opportunity to produce atomic weapons. 
All this will create a serious threat to the national interests of France. 
Nevertheless; the ruling circles of France are striving for the creation 
of "Euratom." The explanation is the same! *Euratom" is profitable to 
the large monopolies. Especial interest is shown by the French uranium 
ore company controlled by the Rothschilds, the Central Society for the

Production of Uranium, and Radioactive Ores and Metals (the Ugine company), 
the French Heavy Water Company (the Pechiney group), the Alsace Machine-
Building 'Company, and others. This is why, despite the clear danger for 
the national interests of France, its representatives on 25 March 1957 
signed the agreements on the organization of "Euratom " and the creation 
of a "common market" in the course of twelve to fifteen years. 
The French monopolies hope that the transfer of atomic industry to 
the control of "Euratom" will avoid the possible nationalization of this 
branch of the economy in France. This is what is really hidden behind 
talk that "Euratom" is the way to atomic "progress," the "prosperity" of 
Europe, etc. 
A sinister role was played by the French financial oligarchy in the 
Suez crisis. As is well known, France took a most aggressive stand in 
this problem. At the end of October 1956, together with Great Britain 
and Israel, it undertook an armed attack against Egypt. 
The aggression against Egypt failed. It caused serious injury to 
French interests. France appeared before the whole world in the role of 
an aggressor. The Suez adventure seriously heightened the crisis in the 
French,financial system. According to published data, the participation 
of France in the war against Egypt cost it 90 billion francs. The rup-
ture of trade relations with Egypt increased the loss by 10 billion 
francs. 
But this is by no means all. All sectors of the French economy 
suffered seriously from the aggression against Egypt. As a result of 
the closing of the Suez Canal and the destruction of pipe-lines, France 
was deprived of over 80 percent of the oil it consumed. In addition, 
France used to receive through the Suez Canal two-thirds of the rubber 
it consumed, about 40 percent of its manganese ore, about 90 percent of 
its mica, half of its wool, much of its cotton, and so forth. 
As early as the end of November 1956, gasoline ration cards were 
introduced in France; a passenger car was assigned 30 liters of fuel a 
month. At the beginning of 1957, the fuel allowance was reduced. Long 
lines of automobiles stood at the gasoline pumps. Speculators drove up 
the prices for fuel on the black market. The American journal Newsweek  
told about a curious but typical incident. At one point Menas-France 
hastily sought out a Secretary of State, Paul Anxionnaz, in the lobbies 
of the National Assembly. The two politicians began a heated conversa-
tion. About what? Possibly about the policy to be followed in the Suez 
problem or about Algeria? No, the former Premier of France was' attempt-
ing to acquire twenty liters of gasoline/ 
Because of the shortage of fuel, many industrial enterprises began 
to close down, especially in the automobile industry. Transportation 
expenses rose sharply. Prices went up for many consumer goods. Central

heating in many reeidential buildings was discontinued. The heat was even 
tamed off at the headquarters of the Atlantic Organization in Paris l On 
the railroads, many diesel engines were replaced by steam locomotives. 
In Paris, Marseilles) and in other cities, long unused trolley ears were 
put into operation. Noisily they dragged along the empty streets on which 
automobiles were becoming scarcer and scarcer. 
In unleashing the aggression against Egypt, the French government 
organized an economic blockade against its own countryl 
Why did this take place? Because the French monopolists did not 
want to accept the nationalization of the Suez Canal by Egypt 
In no other western country does the Suez Canal Company have such 
ties with einanci41 and industrial circles as it does in France. In no 
other country is there such a large group of people interested in the 
prosperity of this company. The France Presse Agency reported that the 
nationalization cf the Suez Canal "particularly affects French financial 
circles, since a large part of the capital is held in France. ,..It is 
exactly in Fiance that all the private stockholders are located.2 
While the forty-four percent of the company 0s stock owned in Great 
Britain belongs exclusively to the British government, the fifty-two per-
cent of the'company0s stocks owned in France are divided among private 
perions, the great majority of which are large property-owners. And for 
each share, with anoMinal value of 250 francs, the company paid earnings 
of 7,246 francs in 19558 It is difficult to find in the capitalist world 
an enterprise which would provide such high profits. In the Administra-
tive  
Council of the Suez Canal Company, composed of 32 directors, there 
were Sixteen Frenchmen. And each of them received an enormous salary; 
thus, in 1955, they earned 7,000,000 francs merely for attending meetings 
once a month. The French bourgeoisie received a total net profit of at 
least 5 billion francs from the exploitation of the Suez Canal in 1955, 
according to rough estimatesi 
While the Suez Canal Company in Egypt was a nstate within a state,n 
in France it formed par* of those powerful forces which ran the govern-
ment behind the Scenes, The French directors in the Administrative 
Council represent the 'largest French banks?, The Paris-Netherlands Bank, 
the Indo-China Bank (the Lazard, Rothschild and Schneider-Creuset groups), 
the Bank of Industrie' and Commercial Credit, the Lyons Bank, and many 
financial and industrial firma.

tween the Suez Canal Company and the financiAl and industrial monopolies 
of France. Since 3.9480 the President of the company has been Francois

General Secretary of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. While he 
headed the Suez Canal Company, he was simultaneously a member of the board 
of the Paris-Netherlands Bank, the Societe Marseillaise de Credit, the 
Compagnie Fran2aise de 11Afrique Occidentale, the Land Bank of Egypt, the 
President of tEe Comite' Central de la France d90utre-Mer, and so forth. 
Members of the board of the Suez Canal Company (Pierre Fournier, 
Emile Minost, Jacques Georges-Picot (General Manager of the company), 
Melchior de Voitl(, Humbert de Wendel, Emmanuel Monick, and others) are 
also representatives of many large financial and industrial monopolies. 
Leading politicians in France were directly interested in Suez Canal 
Company profits. 
But the threat to the profits gained from the exploitation of the 
Suez Canal was not the only reason why the French monopolistic circles 
demanded a military intervention in Egypt. They were also concerned 
over their investments in nearly all branches of the Egyptian economy 
-- in water supply, gas production, electricity, municipal transporta-
tion, trade, and so forth. These investments amount to the colossal sum 
of 450 billion francs. The owners of these investments were concerned 
lest the nationalization of the Suez Canal would lead to the nationali-
zation by Egypt of branches of the economy which had been controlled by 
French monopolists. 
Finally, one cannot ignore the particular interest of the oil monop-
olies in the Suez Canal, who were frightened lest the nationalization of 
the Suez Canal would be a signal for the nationalization of the oil in-
dustry being exploited by them in other Near Eastern countries. 
It was for these reasons that the financial and monopolistic circles 
in France inspired the policy of aggression against Egypt. 
At the very height of the loud campaign for military intervention 
in Egypt, at the end of August 1956, the scandalous "affair of the checks" 
came out into the open. The editors of many Paris newspapers received 
letters from the former management of the Suez Canal Company, in which 
it was proposed that the newspapers defend the interests of this company, 
which was nationalized by the legal owner of the Suez Canal -- Egypt. 
To each of these letters was attached a check for 100,000 francs& 
Honest newspapers at once indignantly informed their readers of this 
attempted bribery. The American Associated Press agency reported that 
the heads of the former Suez Canal Company, oplaced in a difficult posi-
tion," acknowledged that they had sent the checks to the newspaper edi-
tors. They called it a mistake. But the press which directly displayed 
the points of view of the monopolists, including La vie francaise and 
Information, began to preach openly a "crusade" against Egypt. The first

prize in this field, without any doubt, was won by the newspaper Aux 
de la In an article with the heading "Oil Before Every-
thing," it wrote in August 1956ft "It is necessary to act quickly and 
without warning. Two or three divisions of parachute troops located on 
Cyprus can be sent in one night to the oil fields... The territory of 
Kuwait, which alone will produce 60,000,000 tons of oil this year (31.5 
percent of all the Middle Eats production)) has a population of only 
200,000... Is it conceivable that 60,000,000 tons of oil, sixty per-
cent of the vital requirements of Europe, be under the control of 
200,000 personsI.). But to whom should this oil belong? To the people 
who lived around it as if it did not exist, or to the European and 
Western industry which developed this oil by its own efforts? There is 
no doubt that the civilized nations have an overriding right to use this 
oil. This overriding right must be decisively defended." 
"Economic sanctions against Egypt are insufficient_a concluded the 
newspaper. ?The necessity of military intervention must be acknowledged." 
Regardless of the national interests of the country, the monopolistic 
circles instigated France to undertake the criminal aggression against 
Egypt. 
* * * 
such are the facts. They convincingly show that French post-war 
foreign policy -- a policy of military blocs? the armament of West Ger-
many and the preparation of war -- is determined exclusively by the 
interests of French monopoly capital. This policy is followed for the 
sake of the trusteo profits, although it represents a deathly threat to 
the national interests of France and to the cause of peace. This policy 
is being revealed more and more as the leaders of the French Rairenat. 
ever more insolently and cynically dictate their will to the great and 
glorious nation which has made an invaluable contribution to the progress 
of mankind. The French writer Anatole France wrote with distress and 
indignation "After France had liberated itself from the power of the 
kings and emperors, and had thrice proclaimed her independence, she fell 
under the power of the financial companies which had seized the riches 
of the country...." 
Since these words were written, the omnipotence of the magnates of 
capital in France has revealed itself in an even more insolent and un-
concealed form. And their anti-national activity ie having even more 
disastrous results, since it is directed towards preparing and unleash-
ing an atomic war which would threaten the very existence of Ftance. 
It is therefore not surprising that the patriotic forces, constantly 
becoming stronger, are taking a stand against parasitic French capitalism 
and its policy of national betrayal.

The forces of national rebirth in France are growing, striving to 
change French policy and to subordinate it to the interests of the people. 
The Bank of War 
A. Alekseyev 
At the end of 1955, It French journalist asked several dozen Parisians 
chosen at random on the street: "Who in France, in your opinion, has done 
the greatest harm to the cause of peace in the last few years?" The ma-
jority of those asked named the Indo-China Bank. Indeed, in France the 
concepts "I. B." and war have almost been synonyms for a long time. When 
gunpowder begins to reek again in the French colonies, the French say: 
"Cherchez la Banque de loIndochine" (look for the Indo-China Bank). 
The name "I. B." is associated with a number of protracted colonial 
wars which French imperialism has conducted in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. 
The "I. B." bears a large part of the responsibility for the san-
guinary events of recent years in Morocco, Tunis and Madagascar. The 
patriots of Algeria fighting for the independence of their country prop-
erly consider the ?I. B." as one of their worst enemies. 
This bank was one of the inspirers of the bloody Suez adventure of 
the British, French and Israeli aggressors, who attacked the peace-loving 
Egyptian people on the night of 30 October 1956. 
The bank's magnates are dreaming of regaining their former posses-
sions in China with the aid of Chiang Kai-Shek. 
Even in South America, the pernicious influence of this Parisian 
bank is clearly being felt. Whenever a routine reactionary military 
revolution takes place in any of the South American countries, prices 
shoot up for the stocks of the South American companies in which the 
"I. B." ha $ invested. 
* * * 
The Indo-China Bank has existed for over eighty years. Its entire 
history is that of a business based on the oppression of colonial and 
dependent peoples and on unrestrained military speculations and frauds. 
The "I. B." was established in Paris at the beginning of 1875 as 
the result of an agreement among five of the largest of the French pri-
vate banks on the joint exploitation of the new French colonies. Its 
organizers were the Banque de Paris at des Pays-Bas, which financed 
trade in goods from the colonies; Cr4dit Industriel at Commercial, a 
union of a group of Catholic banking establishments controlling various 
branches of French industry and trade; the bank Soci4t4 G4n4rale? rep, 
resenting the interests of the great industrial group of Schneider; and 
the credit-issuing banks, Crddit Lyonnais and Comptoir National dDEscomptes 
de Paris. (At present the last three banks are nationalised.)

At the time that the "I. B." was established, French positions on 
the Indo-China peninsula were not at all firm. It is true that in 1862 
the French imperialists, after a long and bloody war, were able to im-
pose a one-sided peace treaty upon the Annamese emperor and to seize 
Cambodia in 1867. Still, the population of Vietnam and Cambodia did 
not lay down their arms. Life was still hot for the French colonizers 
in Indo-China. Vietnamese guerillas and units of Chinese volunteers, 
the so-called "Black Banners." continued their heroic fight against the 
foreign invaders. Under these conditions, the "I. B.* directed its 
main efforts towards financing and organizing regular military opera-
tions against the peoples of Indo-China who were fighting for their 
freedom. 
Experts and advisers of the "I. B.6 accompanied the French troops 
in their military campaigns deep in the interior of the country, while 
the central branch of the bank in Indo-China became a second general 
staff of the French armed forces on the peninsula. Receiving extensive 
support and aid from the French ruling circles and the Vatican) the bank 
did not spare either the French soldiers or money. Additional French 
troops were being constantly dispatched to Indo-China. But. despite 
all the efforts of the colonizers and the vast military superiority of 
their forces) it was not until 1884 that France was able to establish 
formally its protectorate over Vietnam. In Laos the protectorate was 
established even later, in 1893. 
In addition to planning and financing military measures) the 
leaders of the "I. B0,11 its "brain trust," consisting of representatives 
of the largest French financial and industrial groupings:, from the very 
beginning of the bankes existence began to take energetic measures for 
carrying out its plans for the economic enslavement of the occupied 
territory. A French newspaper at that time stated that the stockholders 
of the "I. B." had great hopes that the "economic masterym of the new 
colony would bring them great profits. It is true that there was ample 
basis for such hopes. 
Indo-China, which is rightly considered the pearl of Southeast Asia, 
is one of the richest areas of the world. The rich tropical soil, as 
well as the abundant warmth and moisture, makes it possible to reap up 
to two, and in some areas three, harvests a year. The aboriginal popu-
lation of Indo-China, before the seizure of the country by the colonizers, 
had for may centuries not only fed itself but also always carried on an 
extensive trade in agricultural products with neighboring countries. 
The plant and animal life of IndoChina is famous for its variety 
and richness.

In the peninsulaos thick forests grow rose-colored, red, black, 
"iron" and many other rare varieties of trees. In most of the countryps 
districts conditions are especially favorable for growing coffee and 
rubber and other valuable tropical and semi-tropical crops. 
Indo-China is rich in iron ore, zinc, lead, tin, manganese, coal, 
copper, gold and many other valuable minerals. 
Betting the seizure of the countryos natural resources as its goal, 
the Indo-China Bank undertook a systematic and planned attempt to carry 
out this aim. 
During the first period of its existence, its primary efforts were 
directed towards seizing land in the accessible plains of the peninsula. 
At the same time, the bank invested considerable sums in road construc-
tion, seeking to create the conditions for exporting agricultural prod-
uots and raw materials for industry from the country. 
The seizure of land by the bank, either directly or through various 
joint companies, was carried out very intensively. By the beginning of 
the twentieth century, it became, to all intents and purposes, the owner 
of nearly all the best land on the peninsula. By 1900, the land holdings 
of European colonizers in Indo-China totalled 322,000 hectares. 
OA the seized lands, the "I. B.," both directly and through its 
lessees, established vast plantations which soon provided its stockholders 
with enormous income since the labor of the Vietnamese peasants was barely 
paid for. 
At first the colonizers grew chiefly rice on their plantations, about 
three quarters of the land seized being devoted to this purpose. Gradually 
an increasing amount of land was allotted to the production of rubber. 
While 298 tons of rubber were exported from Indo-China in 19350 according 
to official French statistics, in 1938 the figure was 60,000 tons, and in 
1953, 75,000 tons. 
In 19520 the French rubber plantations occupied 70,000 hectares. 
The most important of them belong to subsidiary companies of the "I. Bolig 
Plantations R4unies de Mimot, Societe Indochinoise Des Cultures Tropi-
cales? and Caoutchouo de 10Indochine. 
It also received a large income from its coffee and tea plantations, 
which formally belonged to the companies Hauts Plateaux Indochinois and 
Soci4t4 des Plantations Indochinoises de Th6. 
The data given above describes quite clearly the expansion of the 
"I. B." in Indo-Chinese agriculture. But they do not by any means cover 
all its activities. After seizing enormous areas of land, the bank

established various companies there to exploit the countryls raw material 
resources.; in every way it supported the mining of valuable raw materials.. 
It placed the output of coal, tungsten, phosphates and salt under its 
control. The raw materials obtained on the peninsula underwent only the 
most necessary preliminary processing on the spot, and then were exported 
from Indo-China. 
From the very- beginning of its existence, the "I. B." undeviatingly 
carried out a plundering colonial policy to convert the economy of the 
Indo-Ohinese Peninsula into a dependent annexation of France. To des-
cribe this phase of its activities, one need only cite a few statistics 
concerning Indo-Chinags trade with the western countries, which) for all 
intents and purposes, meant with France. 
In 1901, Indo-Ohina imported from Europe finished goods, some agri-
culturaljzoducts and household goods amounting to 202,0000000 francs, 
and exported mineral raw materials in the sum of 161,000,000 francs. In 
the course of the next forty years, the gross total of trade between Indo-
China and the western countries doubled. During the same period the mate-
rial situation of the population of Indo-China became much worse. From 
year to year hunger and poverty increased in the country, and the popula-
tion was dying out from excessive labor and social diseases. 
The "I. B." did not limit itself only to the exploitation of the 
natural resonrges of the country. Its magnates obtained the right for 
the bank to,issue money in Indo-China and then skillfnlly used this 
right as one of the means to enslave Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia eco-
nomically. By flooding the country with paper piasters and, with the 
assistance of the French government, by establishing an exchange rate 
between piasters and francs which was profitable to the bank, the "I. B." 
acquired the opportunity for unlimited financial spec,ulations which 
brought it record-breaking super-profits. 
?After having conquered Indo-China by fire and sword and having con-
verted it into its own private estate, the "T. B." soon became one of 
the largest and most influential banks in France in many ,.ases impos-
ing its will upon the French government. 
The,bank's_capital, which originally amounted t(:) 8,000,000 francs, 
grew a hundred-fold by 1945 and was 250 times the original amount in 
1954. 
On the _eve of World War II, the sphere of the bankgs activities 
had grown so much that in reality the term mIndo-China" in its name had

Together with the banking house of Rothschild, the banks De Paris at 
Des Pays-Bas? Worms, Lazard Fires et Cie, and several others, the Indo-
China Bank occupied at this time one of the leading positions in the finan-
cial oligarchy which was for all practical purposes governed France. 
Among its large shareholders were the Baroness Rothschild, the poli-
tician Paul Boncourt? Fran9ois Mauriac, Rend Smadja2 and many other lead-
ing Frenchmen. 
In 1959, the bank had representatives in London, Singapore, Tokyo, 
Hong Kong, China, Siam, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, Tangiers, the Hebrides, 
San Francisco, Johannesburg, Lausanne, and in a number of French colonies. 
Its experience in the exploitation of Indo-China enabled the bank 
to deal successfully with its competitors and to win more and more bases 
for its predatory expansion. 
* * * 
Gradually, the "I. B." acquired influence over a number of less 
powerful banks and took over about eighty credit companies (the Franco-
Chinese,. the Franco-Japanese, the Franco-Italian for South America, 
Sabbag? and other banks). 
By 1952, financial income from Indo-China, according to the bankos 
own statistics, represented half of its earnings. 
Faced with the irresistable growth of the national liberation move-
ment in the colonies, the Indo-China Bank sought to put off its inevitable 
fall by diversifying its investments. 
Its expansion into other countries and colonies was in general char-
acterized by the same forms and methods which it had used in Indo-China. 
First came the seizure of land and mineral deposits, then the predatory 
exploitation of the more accessible natural resources, and finally the 
importation of goods at speculative prices from the mother country into 
the areas where the bank had established strong positions. In French 
North Africa and in other French African possessions, the "I. B." gradu-
ally purchased shares of companies already operating and of local banks. 
In the Near East, it employed the Banque Sabbag as its direct repre-
sentative and intermediary, and in Brazil, Uruguay, Mexico and Canada it 
has invested large sums in a number of companies, chiefly engaged in agri-
culture and trade. It is coordinating its activities on the American 
continent with American monopolies, and in return for their support is 
providing them with assistance in Africa.

As in Indo-China, the activities of the "I. B." in the French over-
seas colonies and abroad have a predatory and colonial character. It is 
mercilessly exploiting the native population and is extorting colossal 
super-profits from them, ignoring all accepted human norms and laws. 
,Within France, the Indo-China Bankes investments are chiefly in 
industrial enterprises processing raw materials from the colonies. This 
policy has given it the opportunity of receiving a double profit: first, 
through supplying its enterprises in the mother country with cheap raw 
materials, and, secondly, by selling the finished products of these enter-
prises at monopolistically high prices in the colonies and other countries. 
It is very difficult to give a full picture of the nature of the in-
vestments of "I. B." within France, since such information is kept secret. 
Nevertheless, it is known that the bank is financing a number of companies 
engaged in the production of sugar, rubber and wine9 in the processing of 
precious metals and mineral ores, in trade in consumer goods in the colon-
ies, and so forth. In addition, it is participating directly and indirectly 
in a number of transportation and insurance firms. Representatives of the 
bank sit on the boards of a dozen other banks, firms and trusts. But re-
gardless of how large its role as a holding company in the mother country 
(that is, investing capital in various enterprises), it has been and re-
mains today primarily a colonial bank, and its income derives almost en-
tirely from investments in other companies outside the mother country. 
The Indo-China Bank from the time of its establishment has regarded and 
continues to regard its primary purpose as preserving and expanding its 
"empire" at any cost. Among the methods most willingly used by the bank 
for these purposes, its magnates have consistently given and are continu-
ing to give priority to war. 
During the entire history of the bank, bloody adventures have been 
its best source of income and the most basic method of Consolidating and 
broadening its expansion. The bank has always and everywhere supported 
these adventures and has used them for its own enrichment, 
For twenty-five years war raged on the fields of Vietnam 2 Laos and 
Cambodia. French capital has consolidated its positions on the Indo-
Chinese Peninsula with the aid of bloody military repressions. 
During World War 1, the "I. B." undertook substantial speculations 
in deliveries of military supplies. The profits paid to stockholders 
rose from 6,0009000 to 30,0009000 francs. 
In 1927, defending the interests of the 410 B." and other French 
monopolies, French troops again began military operations in Southern 
Vietnam. They crushed a rebellion of Vietnamese farm laborers -- coolies, 
working on the French rubber plantations. In 1930, French troops drowned 
the vast Yen Bay rebellion in blood, and later did the same with the peas-
ant uprising in Central Vietnam.

But a new height in its activities inimical to the cause of peace 
was attained by the "I. B." after the popular democratic revolution took 
place against the French invaders in Indo-China in August 1945. 
In the declaration proclaiming the republic, the Vietnamese revolu-
tionaries, describing the rule established by the French colonizers in 
Indo-China, stated: 
"They deprived us of all our freedoms. They imposed inhuman laws 
upon us.... They built more prisons than schools. They dealt merci-
lessly with our patriots. They drowned the national movement in rivers 
of blood,. They made drunkards of us and poisoned us with opium in 
order to weaken our people. They shamelessly exploited us, plunged us 
into the most frightful poverty and mercilessly devastated our country. 
They unscrupulously plundered our rice plantations, mines, forests and 
raw materials. They appropriated to themselves the right to issue bank 
notes and monopolized all of our foreign trade. 
"They schemed up hundreds of baseless taxes, forcing our fellow-
countrymen, especially the peasants and small tradesmen, to live in 
dreadful poverty.... They exploited our workers in the most barbarous 
fashion." 
After carrying out its revolution in August, 1945, the Vietnamese 
people firmly resolved to put an end once and for all to the domination 
of the. predatory Indo-China Bank in its country. In reply, the "I. B." 
again turned to its well-tried method of defending its super-profits 
-- to war. 
Under the direct pressure of the "I. B.," the French government in 
1946 unleashed a new colonial, predatory war In Indo-China, whieh the 
French people justly called the "dirty war." During this war, the crim-
inal role of the "I. B," became especially clear, Showing it to be a 
bank of war, violence, plunder of colonies, and speculation. 
* * * 
The "dirty war" in Indo-China began in the fAll of 1946. In launch-
ing it, the French colonizers rudely violated the treaty signed on 6 
March 1946 with the peoplegs democratic government of Vietnam; according 
to which France recognized the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as a "free 
state, having its own government, parliament, army and finances." 
When the guns began to rumble again on the battlefields of Indo?

took all the measures it could to broaden and intensify the armed conflict. 
In every way the French financial oligarchy supported the militaristic 
aspirations of the Indo-China Bank and its monopolistic partners, since 
the war was bringing it further super-profits. 
The United States of America also actively urged France to undertake 
the "dirty war." It promised the French colonizers assistance in every 
way. This promise was kept. At first this was done secretly. But after 
June 1950, when it unleashed aggression in Korea, the United States openly 
supported the French armed forces in the war against the Indo-Chinese peo-
ples? In this, the United States counted on the intensification and broad-
ening of the conflict there with the hope of weakening both sides. Then 
it planned to interfere in the conflict and to seize the French positions 
on the peninsula. 
The French deployed an army of 100,000 men in Vietnam. In the early 
stages, the colonizers troops were able to win some victories, but soon 
the Vietnamese people began to strike smashing retaliatory blows against 
the interventionists. 
The French colonizers' plans, based on a lightning war and a quick 
victory, fell through. The war became a protracted one. The high patri-
otism, selfless courage and the unexampled heroism of the Indo-Chinese 
peoples blocked the aggressors' plans. The "I. B." empire was falling 
apart at the seams. The workers on the rubber and rice plantations left 
their work and went into the forests, joining the People's Liberation 
Army. Work in the mines and other enterprises of the bank went on only? 
under the protection of military reinforcements. 
After becoming convinced that popular resistance could not be broken 
by military superiority alone, the French colonizers launched a reign of 
brutal terror on the territory they controlled against both the soldiers 
of the Vietnamese Army and the civilian population of the country. 
The colonizers made use of the most savage forms of repression in 
their struggle against the Vietnamese. In 1949, three hundred miners at 
Hon Gal., working in the mines of one of the companies connected with the 
"I. B.," were, "in the interests of intimidation" thrown into the sea 
with their hands tied together with steel cables. 
In December, 1952, the French forces, in the course of routine 
operations in a village, seized an eighty-year-old man who was not able 
to flee. They set fire to his clothes and then threw him into a burning 
house. The bandits dealt similarly with a group of old men under arrest; 
they poured gasoline on them and threw them into a fire.

- In pursuing their fire and sword policy, the colonizers did not spare 
monuments of the past or religious establishments. In many pagodas they 
destroyed all the statues in search of gold; a number of temples were com-
pletely destroyed. 
In August 1952, the Vietnamese Information Agency reported from 
Northern Vietnam: 
"In the province of Kuang Yen (Northern Vietnam) the French troops 
often make Vietnamese women their prisoners in the course of their preda-
tory raids! 
"On one occasion they drove some Vietnamese women with children to 
the bank of a river and ordered them to throw the children into the river; 
In the event that they did not obey, they threatened to shoot both the 
women and the children. Since the women held the children still closer 
to them and refused to obey this inhuman order, the French bandits seized 
the children, threw them into bamboo baskets, lowered the baskets into 
the river and began to shoot at them as if they were targets. Many women 
threw themselves into the river to save their children and were shot by 
the French bandits." 
Often the colonizers, attacking the women, pinned them to the ground 
with bayonets, together with their children. The aggressors? crimes every 
day became more brutal and inhuman. 
But no repressions or terror were able to break the resistance of 
the Vietnamese. Then, at the initiative of the "I. B.," the French 
authorities undertook a "scorched earth" policy in Indo-China, calculat-
ing that with hunger as a weapon they would be able to force the people 
to lay down their arms. 
As an example of the methods to which the colonizers resorted in 
following this policy, we may cite the order issued by the commander of 
the French forces in North Vietnam, General de Linares, in March 1951. 
Paragraph 2 of this order states: 
"Section 2. Destruction. There are basically two methods which 
can be used: 
"(1) To soak the rice, either by pouring water over it or by leav-
ing it out in the open during the rainy season. 
"However, to ensure rotting, the rice must be soaked for 48 hours; 
so that there may be no doubt as to the destruction of the supplies, it 
is necessary to make certain that during this period the population does 
not come to remove the rice and place the salvagable part of the rice 
under cover.

"(2) To pour benzine or gasoline on it; in the case of the discovery 
of especially large supplies, it is necessary that the air force be re-
quested to drop cans of benzine." 
In the North Vietnam region alone, the colonizers barbarously destroyed 
13,700 hectares of rice plantations. 
However, the "scorched earth" policy did not bring victory to the 
colonizers either, 
The war cost Indo-China enormous losses in lives. It was accom-
panied by vast destruction and caused irreparable damage to the economy 
of the country. During the war, precious monuments of the centuries-old 
culture of the Vietnamese people were destroyed. The losses caused by the 
war amoUnt to astronomical figures. 
France, in conducting the "dirty war," also lost substantially in 
men and materials. In an official statement of the French Committee for 
the Study and Settlement of the War in Vietnam 9 the results of the war 
for France were described as follows: 
"The continuation of the war in Indo-China is causing indescribable 
suffering. The war has cost both sides hundreds of thousands of deaths. 
It is disturbing the moral feelings and the conscience of the majority of 
Frenchmen.... 
"The 400 or 500 billions of francs annually which the war in Indo-
China is costing France is regularly causing a deficit in its budget, 
aggravating inflation and making any form of stabilization of the cur-
rency impossible. 
"Because of this, it is impossible to improve the living standards 
of the French people and particularly to build hundreds of thousands of 
buildings which are now needed...." 
However, despite the fact that France had really been defeated in 
the first years of the war and despite the opposition of French public 
opinion to the "dirty war" in Vietnam, the war continued for almost 
eight years. 
The "I. B." made use of all its influence both in France and abroad. 
It sought to have the French troops spill their blood as long as possible 
on the battlefields of Indo-China, since the war was bringing the bank 
colossal profits. 
The principal source of profits for the bank during the war proved 
to be speculation with piasters. Income from this increased as the war 
came to have fewer hopes and results.

According to unofficial calculations, uI. B." profits from this 
speculation reached 200 billion francs a year r exercising its right 
to issue currency in Indo-China until 1947, and then with the aid of the 
obedient financial departments of the puppet Bao Dal government? the 
"I. Bon during the war artificially devaluated the Indo-Chinese currency, 
simultaneously supporting a disproportionately high official exchange 
rate, One piaster was exchanged for seventeen francs, although in reality 
it was worth only eight or nine. This enabled the bankgs agents to carry 
out innumerable speculative currency transactions in Indo-China. They 
bought up piasters for almost nothing and sent them by various thieving 
machinations to France. Exchanging them there for francs, they made 
enormous profits through robbing the French treasury. 
Although these dark machinations of the "I. Bon were kept carefully 
concealed, some of them were accidently made known and drew the atten-
tion of a large part of the French public. At the demand of the progres-
sive deputies, the National Assembly of France was compelled to set up a 
special commission to investigate the dirty machinations of the operators 
of the Indo-China Bank. The commission discovered that outstanding poli-
ticians of the country were involved in the banks machinations. 
"The investigation showed," announced the Communist Kriegel-Valrimont 
in the National Assembly, "that the speculation in piasters was organized 
more cleverly, subtly and cunningly than is known to the Public. The 
transfer of plasters, though illegal and deleterious to the country, 
amounted to hundreds of billions of francs, and it is even difficult to 
establish the number of witnesses to the machinations who paid with their 
lives only because they knew too muchon 
Despite the obvious criminal nature of these speculations, the offi7 
cial investigation into them did not produce any results. The affair was 
suppressed by the banks protectors in high places. 
Another major source of income for the nIo B." during the war was 
through the devaluation of the piaster. The devaluation led to an un-
bridled rise in prices in the country. Thus, for example, after the 
devaluation of May 1953, the wages of workers in South Vietnam fell by 
thirty to fifty percent. 
The devaluation enabled the agents of the III. B.?n who bought Indo-
Chinese goods for practically nothing, to gain additional profits for the 
products imported from France, which were sold in the market for higher 
prices. 
During the war, the profits of the "I. B." rose from 49,000,000 to 
638,000,000 francs. During this period, the banks capital, according 
to official statistics, grew from 157 million to 2 billion francs, and 
the capital of all the firms connected with the bank, to 16 billion 
francs.

According to a leading French politician, Mitterrand, the govern-
ment spent three trillion francs in taxpayers o money on the war in Indo-
China. The total damage caused to France by this war is even larger 
than this astronomical figure. 
In 1954, after the severe defeat at Dien Bien Phu, the French rul-
ing circles were obliged to give up their military operations in Vietnam, 
Laos and Cambodia? On July 21, 1954, an agreement on ending the war in 
Indo-China was signed at Geneva. 
In a difficult, bloody war the peoples of Indo-China won a well-
deserved victory and saved their national independence. 
The owners of the Indo-China Bank drew their own conclusions from 
the military defeat of France. At the end of the war, the bank removed 
a*large part of its investments from Indo-China and transferred them to 
safer places. 
* * * 
After the collapse of the French aggression in Indo-China the "I. 
B.," seeking new spheres in which to use its capital, began to pay par-
ticular attention to the French possessions in Africa. As the basic 
means for its expansion in Algeria and Tunis, the bank made use of the 
Creait Foncier dtAlgerie et de Tunisie Company, while in Morocco it 
used the Banque Industrielle de 18Afrique du Nord. In Black Africa it 
took over a number of commercial and land banks, through which it created 
several companies to mine iron, graphite, gold and other ores. Further-
more, to strengthen its positions in Africa, the Indo-China Bank made 
extensive Use of the right to issue currency in the French possessions 
in Oceania, French Equatorial Africa, New Caledonia and Togoland. 
After Chiang Kai-shek had been driven from China, the "I. B." 
transferred the capital of its Franco-Chinese Bank to Madagascar. 
Thus, as in Indo-China, agents of the "I. B." soon once more be-
came Participants in the hostilities in Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria. 
The bank embarked upon particularly extensive activity in Algeria. 
Together with the other large French monopolies, it persistently urged 
the French government to undertake ever more severe repressions against 
the freedom-loving Algerian people and in the long run contributed to 
the launching of the war in Algeria. "Algeria is becoming another Indo-
China)" the American newspaper, New York World Telegram and Sun, stated 
at the end of 1956. 
When the British, French and Israeli troops attacked Egypt in No-
vember 1956 overt and covert agents of the "I. B." in France and abroad 
let out such shouts of joy that the bank' s participation also in this

military adventure became clear. How could it fail to be a participant? 
Itis well known that the board of directors of the Suez Canal Company 
includes Emile Minost, Chairman of the Board of the "I. B.," as well as 
a number of his representatives. According to unofficial information, 
he owned a considerable number of shares in the Suez Canal Company. 
When the British, French and Israeli aggression against Egypt 
failed and a severe blow had been dealt to Frances position in the 
Near East, the "I. B." undertook urgent additional measures to protect 
its interests in Africa. It decided to come to an agreement with its 
more powerful rivals and competitors. In December 1956, the "European 
Consortium for the Development of the Natural Resources of Africa" was 
established in Luxembourg. This consortium, "Consafrica," as it is 
called for short in the French press, is now one of the principal under-
takings of the bank, as has been admitted by sources close to the "I. B." 
With its aid it plans to conquer Africa, lay its hands on the natural 
resources of the Sahara, and, if necessary, defend its "African empire" 
by force. 
The bank owns twenty percent of the capital of "Consafrica." 
In establishing the new consortium, the "I. B." has turned to its 
old tactics, which it had tested as far back as the Vichy period. At 
that time the bank participated in a company, Soci4te de Crjdit Inter-
continental, created at the initiative of the German monopolies and the 
American ones supporting them, and setting as its goal the plundering 
of the European countries occupied by the Hitlerites, their colonies in 
Africa, and other areas. The director of the bank, Paul Baudouin, was 
a minister in the Main government. This time the consortium is set-
ting itself a more limited goal, the plunder of Africa. 
Not satisfied with the establishment of a consortium in Luxembourg, 
the Indo-China Bankgs agents in the French Parliament hurriedly rushed 
through a new law to unify the administration of the French possessions 
in the Sahara in order to facilitate the operations of "Consafrica." 
On 14 December 1956, the National Assembly passed this law, called 
the law on the "General Organization of the Regions of the Sahara." In 
connection With this decision of the National Assembly, the France Presse 
Agency reportedt 
"The administrative reorganization under discuasion will facilitate 
the development of an area nine times as large as France. According to 
the latest estimates, in a few years it will be able to satisfy a quarter 
of the mother countrygs demands for oil. Also, large reserves of coal, 
copper, iron and uranium have been found."

Progressive public opinion in France, alarmed by the new machinations 
of the bank and its partners, properly regards "Consafrica" as threatening 
more speculations and fraud, more colonial plunder, and additional wars 
and robbery on the African continent. 
Such is the Indo-China Bank -- a bank of war and colonial violence, 
a bank of robbery and fraud. In seeking to save the colonialism which 
is now doomed, as well as the degenerating colonial empire of France, the 
"I. B." is weaving a web of war. But it is becoming constantly more diffi-
cult to carry out its policy of robbery; the peoples of Africa and other 
countries have drawn all the lessons necessary from the failure of the 
aggressive plans of the colonizers in Indo-China, Tunisia, Morocco and 
Egypt. 
The Traitor Bank A. Alekseyev 
It is difficult to measure the privations and sufferings which France 
endured during the years of the second world war. The Hitierite occupiers 
were striving to transform it from a great power into a province of small 
importance of the Nazi Reich, and the proud French people into their obedi-
ent slaves. For this purpose they robbed and murdered the French men and 
women with unlimited brutality, jeered at the great French culture and the 
glorious freedom-loving traditions of the country, undermined its economy 
in every way and barbarously destroyed its natural resources. According 
to the following figures, which are far from complete, the German aggres-
sion cost France 802,000 killed, 40 trillion francs in losses (in francs 
of 1951), 452,000 destroyed homes, 1,436,000 damaged buildings, 51,000 
ruined farms, 49,500 destroyed enterprises, 4,010 destroyed bridges, etc. 
The war brought grief and unhappiness to millions of French people, left 
hundreds of thousands of unfortunate cripples and orphans, reduced entire 
regions of the country to terrible poverty.... And in spite of all this, 
in France again are heard voices glorifying the killing of mankind and 
militarism. The reactionary pen-pushers exalt the recent bloody Anglo-
French-Israeli venture in the Sinai peninsula and call for new military 
provocations. And again, just as it was on the eve of the second world 
war, the criminal agents-provocateurs and the war-mongers of a new war 
have influential defenders and patrons, who are dreaming of doing "busi-
ness" on the blood and sufferings of their countrymen. The discussion 
below will deal with one of these "businessmen" -- the French bank of 
Worms9 
* * * 
The Bank of Worms belongs to a number of the most influential finance-
industrial groups in France, privately owned but the real proprietors of 
the country. In its financial power, it is inferior to the banks of Roths-
child, Lazar, Mirabeau and a number of other of the most important banking 
-304-

Approved For Release 2001/07/28 : CIA-RDP65-00756R000300270001-9 
houses. Nevertheless the Bank of Worms merits being singled out among 
other pillars of the French financial oligarchy, because it is more and 
more acquiring fame as the most ?dynamic" bank of the country, and as 
one of the principal monopolists in the field of the atomic industry, 
which is new for France. 
Characterizing the mercenary aristocracy of his time, Cardinal 
Richlieu in his time said: ?If it were possible to buy all of France, 
they would buy France from France itself." These words involuntarily 
come to mind upon acquaintance with the past and the present activity of 
the Bank of Worms. 
The Bank of Worms is a young plunderer. It was only founded in 
1927 as a trade company, at the head of which was the large ship owner 
Ippolit Worms. The bank was created as a private joint-stock company. 
But the decisive role in it, from the time of its establishment, has 
been played, and is being played by the members of the Worms family, 
who depend in their turn upon financial aid and support from the Lazar 
family, with which Ippolit Worms is connected by blood ties. 
At first the bank engaged, on the whole, in the financing of in-
dustrial and trade operations, in which the company of Worms had spe-
cialized formerly (trade of coal and non-ferrous metals, the transport 
of freight by sea, ship building, etc.). The affairs of the young bank 
proceeded poorly: it was overpowered by stronger and more deft competi-
tors. Several times t was on the verge of failure and avoided it only 
by means of successfully carried out speculative operations, and direct 
support by the Lazar bank. During this period the bank acquired the 
reputation of being an adventurer, prepared, for the sake of profit, for 
any of the most shady transactions; this reputation was well maintained. 
It is necessary to say that the majority of French banks does not shun 
improper speculations, but the Bank of Worms, having started speculative 
ventures, far surpassed its fellows and competitors in this respect. 
This could not be conducive to an increase of the number of its clients: 
the first years of the bank's existence passed by in an atmosphere of 
uncertainty as to the future and pessimism. 
But in the beginning of the thirties, soon after Hitlervs coming 
to power in Germany, the affairs of the Bank of Worms began, unexpectedly 
for many, to improve quickly. It established close contact with a number 
of large German and Italian monopolies, carried out operations with con-
siderable SUMs both in francs as well as in foreign currency, played on 
the exchange, set up connections with prominent politicians of France. 
Simultaneously, the number of correspondents and representatives of the 
bank abroad increased, especially in Germany and Italy. 
Ttle secret of the unexpected prosperity of the Bank of Worms was 
incomprehensible to the majority of people for a long time. Only in 
1934 did the facts become known to French public opinion, facts which

permitted a slight opening of the veil of secrecy which had hitherto   . . 
con-
cealed the sources from which considerable "free" funds camp into the 
tills of the bank. 
In February 1934, following the collapse of the fascist putsch which 
the fascist leagues operating in France at that time had prepared, it was 
discovered that the Bink of Worms linked the leaders of these leagues with 
certain French monopolies and foreign banks. But formnlly_the activity 
of the bank proceeded within-the "legal" limits of French law, andthere 
were no sanetions of any kind taken against it. Inspired by this, the 
bank soon again began an active support of fascist elements in the coun-
try. When in the middle of 1936, the renegadenoriot created in France 
a fascist party, the bank quickly rendered all-round aid to it. And 
what is more, two of its proteges -- Marion and Foudhe? became part of 
the dominating nucleus of Doriotla party, and Dorlotenjoyed extensive 
credit in the bank. 
! 
Simultaneously the bank, as it later turned out, was financing the 
secret organization of fascist spies and killers -- the Cagoulards. 
Money of the bank was used for the organization of underground store-
houses of weapons, terrorist acts, explosions, and arson. Through the 
Cagoulards, the bank established connections with aristocratic military 
circles of France. 
f 
Having finished their murderous raids and other crimes, the partici-
pants of the Cagoulard band, after the example of the flu flux-Klan, put 
black hoods (in French the word for hood is cagoul) on for disguise. 
When the organization of Cagoulards was exposed, and its connections 
with the Bank of Worms were revealed, the progressive circles of France 
began to demand, that the "cavil]." be removed from the bank, that is the 
"hood" be taken off. However, just as in 1934, it came off scatheless. 
The matter of the Cagoulards was hushed up. Their protectors were 
Petain, Doriot and other reactionaries, whose reputation the French rul-
ing circles protected in every way, counting on using them in the future 
in their shady political game. 
After the exposure of the plot of the Cagoulards? the Bank of Worms 
was removed fromactive political life for some time. Indignation of 
the broad masses at its pro-fascist activity was so great that the board 
? ., 
of directors of the bank considered it Useful to maneuver and wait for 
"better times." 
These "better times" came for it after Munich. When the Munich 
agreement thickened on the European political horizon the clouds fore-
shadowing the second world war, the tank of Worms developed a rapid 
activity. Its agents became habitues in the editorial offices of French 
newspapers which propagandized defeatist slogans of non-resistance to

fascism. Members of the government, connected with Pdtain, Laval and 
other future leaders of Vichy, maintained constant contact with the bank. 
By the beginning of the war the Bank of Worms almost openly financed the 
French fascists, using the funds of French monopolies and the German in-
telligence service. Simultaneously it consolidated its connections with 
those English and American business circles, which were very much inter-
ested in its activity, directed at the support of Hitlerites and their 
French supporters. The old combined sympathies for the Cagoulards brought 
the bank together with a number of influential representatives of the 
London City, with whom it had established close, friendly connections. 
Among the Cagoulards? there were also pro-English public men: Vibeaul 
Fonrcaut, Paseg. 
The money turnover of the bank began to increase not by days, but 
by hours. The information of the board of directors of the bank concern-
ing all state affairs permitted it to carry out the most speculative 
transactions. The pre-war boom, and the feverish military activity 
brought many million francs of profit to the bank. 
In 1940 the board of directors of the bank announced the increase 
of its fixed capital by 10 times -- from 4 million to 40 million francs. 
Simultaneously the bank began to participate in a number of joint-stock 
companies and in various trade transactions, which had no relation to 
its usual type of operations. For the sake of propriety, the board of 
directors explained that the financial basis of the bank was strengthened 
in connection with the increase of its authority and the expansion of 
its traditional operations. But nobody believed this explanation -- the 
operations and transactions of the bank formally concerned mainly sea 
transport, which after the beginning of the second world war not only 
did not increase, but, on the contrary, seriously decreased. 
After the defeat of France in the war, and the coming to power of 
Petain, the board of directors of the Bank of Worms openly declared its 
adherence to fascism. The bank began to play one of the principal roles 
not only in the financial, but also in the political life of Vichy. 
The Germans fermally sequestered that part of its property, which had 
fallen into their hands. This, however, did not impede its activity. 
When at the beginning of 1941, the cabinet of Admiral Darien came 
to power, the Bank of Worms, using its old connections with the Admiral, 
sent its representatives to all basic organs of the government of the 
country. The co-manager of the bank, Jean Jacques Barneau held the 
post of "general delegate of the French government on questions of 
Franco-German economic relations." He controlled the activity of all 
the banks, joint-stock companies and companies in the territory of Vichy. 
This gave him the opportunity to create especially favorable conditions 
for the further enrichment of the Bank of Worms.

In this same trend, to the bank was rendered every kind of assistance 
by its old agent PierrePouch4t, who, in the Vichy government, first held 
the position of Minister of Industrial Production, and then the position 
of Minister of Internal Affairs. Pouchei was not on the board of directors 
of the Bank of Worms, but was an administrator of one of the daughter 
enterprises of the bank -- the Japi Company. Pouch& used all the means 
and many opportunities which he obtained while holding the ministerial 
positions in order to secure advantageous "business w for the Bank of 
Worms. The war created an exceptionally favorable environment for vari-
ous shady intrigues, which yielded fabulous profits. 
Barneau andPouchet, in their activity for the benefit of the Bank 
of Worms, helped such prominent Vichy leaders as Robert Labbe, who sub-
sequently obtained, for services rendered, the post of co-manager of the 
board of directors of the bank; Baudouin, through whom the bank main-
tained contact with the Bank of Indo-China, and others. Even "Marshall" 
P4tain himself rendered services to the Bank of Worms. When Laval headed 
the Vichy government, into his cabinet, besides the already named protdes 
of the bank, came the brother of the director of the bank --- Jacques 
Lerois Lado-uri as the Minister of Agriculture. Thus was formed the direct 
contact of the board of directors of the bank with the Vichy traitors, who 
repaid it a hundred-fold for the support which it had rendered at one time. 
Important posts in the Vichy government could be obtained by the pro-
t4gds of the Bank of Worms only with the consent of the German occupiers, 
and may because during this period, the bank, just as formerly, continued 
to serve the German intelligence service faithfully. 
The energetic activity of the agents of the Bank of Worms in the 
Vichy government helped it, in the years of the war, to expand signifi-
cantly the sphere of its operations both within France, as well as abroad. 
During this time it took over a number of its weak competitors) bought or 
by other means obtained a majority of the shares of the dlockner Coal Com-
pany and the joint-stock company Union of French Exporters of Northern 
Europe. Representatives of the bank penetrated into the board of direc-
tors of a whole series of other large banking companies and joint-stock 
companies in the field of navigation, trade in colonial goodst. etc. 
Depending upon the support and protection of the state machinery and 
the German occupiers, the bank obtained a multitude of special privileges 
in the period of power of the Vichy government. Before the landing of 
the Allies in Africa, the bank engaged in the export from Africa of valu-
able raw materials, and the resale of the raw materials to the Germans. 
In this connection it succeeded in obtaining a number of advantages in 
theJield of trade with French overseas territories9 Since then, and up 
to the present, the bank has been giving special attention to banking and 
trade operations connected with exploitation of the natural resources of

the French colonies. Then it was successful in establishing control over 
the activity of all the principal enterprises of the paper industry of 
France, and in obtaining the exclusive right for the import into France 
of wood from abroad. Using the circumstance that a considerable quantity 
of wood was imported into France from Sweden, the bank has been obtaining 
a number of advantages in trade with Sweden and, in essence, has estab-
lished its private control over this trade. Its traditional activity in 
the field of financing of ship building, trade in coal, rare metals, 
etc., has also been developing more than successfully. As a result, the 
capital of the bank during the years of the war increased several times; 
its connections with other large banks and monopolies increased and be-
came stronger. 
The war helped it to enter the tight circle of the powerful French 
financial oligarchy. 
When France was liberated, at the demand of public opinion and the 
progressive circles of the country, an investigation was made of the Dank 
of Worms and its principal leaders, and its traitorous activity became 
known to everybody. At the end of 1944 Ippolit Worms himself was arrested, 
charged with collaboration, that is, of collaboration with the enemy. 
However Worms? old connections with Anglo-American capital, which he had 
established in those years when he was financing the Cagoulard movement, 
and then strengthened in the Vichy period, helped him to escape the pun-
ishment which he deserved. Having spent some time in prison and bided 
his time until the passions had subsided, Worms was set free, and legal 
proceedings were not taken against him because of the ?lack of direct 
evidence." Also the majority of the other leaders of the board of direc-
tors of the bank proved themselves in the right. And only its former 
agent -- the Vichy Minister PierrePouch4-6? was shot as a traitor. 
This occurred in March 1944 in Algiers. The influential friends of the 
bank could then still not openly come to the aid ofPouchA, guilty of 
the death of Chateaubriand patriots and hundreds of other soldiers who 
had given up their life for France. 
In the first years after the end of the second world war, the Bank 
of Worms kept in the background. The capital which it acquired during 
the war remained entirely at its disposal. The old connections with 
collaborationists soon again began to be useful, as many of them, de-
pending upon the aid and support of French reactions again held secure 
jobs in the French state machinery. The great experience of the bank 
in the field of financing anti-French activity also had not been for-
gotten. 
Soon the bank again appeared in the foreground of the political 
and economic life of the country. And again it began to take a most 
active part in the financing of subversive activities of the enemies

of peace in France. Together with the Bank of Indo-China the banking 
house of Worms Supported and financed "the dirty ware in Vietnam, where 
it had invested significant amounts of capital. When the scandal broke 
because of speculation in Vietnamese piastres, the Bank of Worms, to-
gether with the Bank of Indo-China, turned out to be involved in it. 
However when it became obvious that the war had been lost, the Bank of 
Worms liquidated its capital investments in Indo-China. It in particu-
lar sold its share in the enterprise Distillery cl9Endochine, and then 
began to support the circles which stood for the transfer of the center 
of gravity of the French colonial policy to the African possessions. 
Such a position found ardent approval in the USA, where, by this time, 
Southern Indo-China was already considered an American possession. 
/Ile sphere of the use of the capital of the Bank of Worms and its 
activity continuously increased. Ten years after the end of the second 
world war its tentacles have spread literally into all parts of the 
French Union and of France itself. To describe completely all the nu-
merous connections of, the bank with other financial and industrial groups 
of France, as well as all aspects of the activity of enterprises con-
trolled by it, is very difficult. The real owners of France -- the 
financial _tycoons and monopolies -- do not like to reveal their secrets 
unnecessarily-, and they are secrets better guarded than the most impor-
tant military objectives. However some specific data concerning indi-
vidual aspects of the activity of the bank are known, and through this 
data it is possible to get an idea of its role in the enonomic and po-
litical life of France at the present time. 
Judging by the official reports of the bank and other sources, 
operations in the field of sea transport continue to remain the special 
sphere of its activity. The bank has at its disposal more than 5 per-
cent 9f all the French .Merchant fleet and 30 percent of the tanker 
fleet. By means of various companies, it controls up to 20 percent of 
the production in the field of shipbuilding. Its principal central en-
terprise is the joint-stock company Worms and Co. registered officially 
as a firm which engages in shipbuilding_ trade in oil and coal, freight, 
and banking operations. This company has at its disposal 400 million 
francs as the capital with which it was chartered, and has its repre-
sentativeS,i4 11 of the largest ports of the oountrL and also numerous 
subsidiariqP abroadt in Egypt, England Holland and other countries. 
At the head of the company is the very same Ippolit Worms. The former 
Vichy leaders Jacques Barneau and Robert Labb, and a creature of the 
Bank of Rothschild, a certain Raymon Minial, are co-directors of the 
company. 
In additi?n to the shares of Worms and Co., the bank owns shares 
in dozens of enterprises in the most diverse branches of industry. Its 
capital investments are especially significant in the machine-building,

mining, and chemical industries, insurance, and foreign trade. A special 
place in the activity of the Bank of Worms is allotted to the exploita-
tion of colenies. It controls the Companie dAfrique Noire, has a con-
siderable amount of shares in the Industrial Bank of North Africa, which 
is controlled by the Bank of Indo-China. The Bank of Worms directs the 
activity of dozens of joint-stock companies in French Equatorial and 
Western Africa, in the Congo and Madagascar. Together with the Bank of 
Indo-China and other banks and monopolies, the Bank of Worms zealously 
protects its capital in the colonies) openly finances the war in Algeria, 
advancing as a violent enemy of the liberation movement of the peoples 
of Africa. 
In addition to the enterprises and companies which the Bank of Worms 
dominates, it also participates, through its capital, in many enterprises 
and companies which belong to other monopolistic and financial groups. 
Jointly with the Lazar Bank and the Bank of Indo-China, the Worm group 
participates in a number of companies which have a monopoly on public 
works contracts. This closely connects it with the influential officials 
and helps it actively to influence the state machinery of France. 
Jointly with the Lazar Bank, the Worms group participates in a number 
of insurance companies, which have a widely branched network of their rep-
resentatives in all regions of France. 
Half of all the shares of the Terr-rar Chemical Products Company, 
which the Bank of Worms owns, provides it a direct contact with the in
monopolistic group of Pechiney. Together with the Bank of Indo-
China it controls the French market in rare and precious metals. Through 
the Telma Television Company in Morocco, the bank is connected with the 
Bloc-Dacco Group, which specializes in aircraft construction. Together 
with this'group the bank actively supported the government of Mendes 
France in 1954-1955 and, as many French newspapers asserted, directed 
his foreign and domestic political activity. 
A number of connections of the group of the Bank of Worms linked 
it with American capital. Under the "Marshall Plan," the bank carried 
out the functions of a middleman in conducting the financial operations 
of this plan. Jointly with the Pan-American Chemical Company, the bank 
controls the company "Society for the Study of the Use of Oxi-Catalysts." 
Together with the Dewey and Allmi Chemical Group it controls the Darex 
Company and2 finally, jointly with American Research -- the Safimo Com-
pany. 
The Safimo business concern, created in 1948 on the initiative of 
the Bank of Worms, specializes in the introduction into industry of 
achievements of modern physics, including atomic energy. In the crea-
tion of Safimo, together with the Bank of Worms2 participated representa-
tives of a number of other important French and American monopolies.

Safimo succeeded in capturing the monopoly for industrial use in France 
of synthetic radioactivity, and in establishing actual control over all 
the principal work carried out in France in the field of utilization of 
atomic energy both for peaceful, as well as for military purposes. The 
Bank of Worms, in7;erested in the development primarily of the military 
atomic industry, is connected with the most aggressive circles of the 
country, which makes appeals for the creation of the French atomic 
super bomb." And the interests of the bank in the field of the chemi-
cal industry most closely connect it with the French military clique 
which attaches special significance to the activity of the Terr-rar 
Chemical Products Company, which is engaged in the mining and processing 
of uranium. This company has now created subsidiaries in India and Bra-
zil. 
The interest of the Bank of Worms in the development in France of 
branches of industry which are working for war, and its old connections 
with foreign intelligence services, push the bank into active partici-
pation in the political life of the country. However) the activity of 
the bank in this field is carefully veiled. The bank is obviously afraid 
of failures similar to those which caused it much trouble during the 
period of the exposure in France of the fascist leagues and the Cagou-
lards. But it is difficult to conceal the activization of the bank's 
activity. Recently the French newspapers have been openly writing about 
this activization of activity. "Friends" of the bank explain this fact 
by "the special dynamism" of the bank. 
This "dynamism" referred to, is especially clearly manifested under 
the Mendes-France government, with which the Bank of Worms was closely 
connected. 
The post of state secretary for scientific-research work and tech-
nical progress in this government was held by Andre Lonchambon, who was 
Simultaneously chairman of two companies whose activities are controlled 
and directed by the Worms Group. The members of the boards of directors 
of a number of firms connected with this group ---Monteil Geren de Bomon, 
Kayave, occupied the posts of: State Secretary for Naval Affairs, State 
Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and State Secretary for Economic Affairs. 
Other ministers of the cabinet of Mendes-France also maintained indirect 
connections with the Bank of Worms. 
It is not by chance therefore that the government of Mendes-France 
carried out a series of foreign and domestic policy measures which cor-
responded to the interests of the group of the Bank of Worms. Namely, 
this government obtained the ratification by the National Assembly of 
the aggressive Paris pacts, proclaimed the necessity for the creation 
of a European armaments pool, achieved the activization of the French 
monopolies in French colonies. Mendes-France fought in every way for 
the development of the military atomic industry in France, and served 
as the initiator of the intensification of capital investments in the 
metallurgical industry.

? It is not by chance, evidently, that the government of E. Faure, which 
replaced the government of Mendes-France, continued to carry out the policy 
of Mendes-France, namely, in those questions in which the Bank of Worms 
and its partners were interested. Indeed the Bank of Worms was also con-
nected by a number of direct and indirect ties with the government of Faure. 
In order to influence the public opinion of the country, the Bank of 
Worms resorted to the services of the corrupt, bourgeois press in France. 
In French journalistic circles, it is widely known for example, that the 
newspaper Information always obediently follows the "advice" of the Bank 
of Worms, and Paris Press en Transition is one of the most persistent pro-
tectors of the interests of the bank. Many newspapers and magazines, con-
nected with the largest newspaper-book trust Achet, in particular the news-
paper France-Soir, in every way boosts the Worms group and glorifies its 
activity. 
,It is not just the Bank of Worms alone which works in France for war, 
orienting itself in its activity upon the aggressive policy of the Anglo-
American circles. But it plays one of the first violins in the political 
orchestra of the French financial oligarchy, which is supporting this 
policy. Therefore the exposure of its dangerous, indeed, subversive ac-
tivities serves the cause of peace. 
The Do.11arvs TraVelling, Salesman A. Khazanov 
When the organizers of the North Atlantic Union decided to place a 
war-industrial base under it, and under the army of mercenaries of the 
dollar, planned on the basis of this union, Jean Monnet was entrusted 
with the task of "selling" this idea to public opinion in France, and 
with its realization. 
The choice was far from being just chance. A Frenchman by birth, 
Jean Monnet is a typical businessman-cosmopolite. He is well known on 
all the exchanges of the capitalist world -- not without reason did the 
reactionary American magazine Life call him "a citizen of France, London, 
New Yor, and Washington." 
The cognac manufacturer, having traveled over half the world at one 
time in search of markets for the sale of products from his firm, had, 
at the same time, much experience in diplomatic activity: he was deputy 
to the General Secretary of the League of Nations, in 1939 headed the 
French Purchasing Mission in Washington, and later served as chairman of 
the so-called Anglo-French Coordinating Committee in l939L-1940, during 
the black months for France. Finally, the reputation of international 
banker was firmly attached to him, since he had learned in the minutest 
details all the stratagems of international transactions and calculations. 
Monnet had close connections with the banking house of Kuhn, Loeb, and Co. 
on Wall Street, with John McCloy of the Rockefeller bank Chase Manhattan, 
with the largest banking house of the USA, the Bank of America, which be-
longs to the Giannini family.

Possessing the ingratiating courtesy of the merchant, pliant with 
the ladies, Monnet, by evidence of the American press, at the same time 
is famous for the qualities of an abstractly thinking machine.* He 
"is devoted to excess to business.* 
The American press indicates also, that Monnet knows how to stay in 
the background -- he "operates behind the scenes and becomes a mysterious 
man." He is not ambitious -- the inclination for ministerial portfolios 
takes a back seat as compared to his striving for rounding off his bank 
account. Just such a man was suitable in order to convince the French 
people -- and not only the French people -- the rulers, that the military 
North Atlantic bloc needed support in the form of a wide military-indus-
trial base, which would include all the countries of Western Europe. 
This idea subsequently obtained the name of the Schuman plan," after 
the French Minister of Foreign Affairs who officinlly introduced it. 
Biographers of Monnet assert that his main rule in life always was: 
"Choose the necessary person at the necessary time.* And he strictly 
followed this principle, in order "to make his way in the world." In 
his youth, and all the more, in his mature years, Monnet did not burden 
himself with education. He limited himself to college, which he finished 
in his native city Cognac. His father, the head of a cognac firm, was 
far from progressive in ideas and attitudes. The favorite saying ex-
pressed his simple philosophy: "Any new idea is a bad idea." The end 
of the dreams of papa Monnet was to see cognac produced by his firm in 
the taverns of the whole world. Realizing this dream, papa Monnet be-
gan early to put his son into the business. Before the war of 1914 young 
Jean traveled a great deal abroad with samples of his papails cognac -- to 
compete with the famous cognac firm of Martel was difficult. As the cen-
ter of his trade operations the young commercial traveler chose Canada, 
where he succeeded in establishing quite good business relations with 
the Hudson Bay Company, closely connected with the bank of the Lazar 
brothers. 
LTrtoon, opp. p 4302 Connections established by the young Monnet 
with international finance circles proved useful to him later) when they 
gave him the opportunity to get the position of Minister of Trade. The 
young Monnet deftly used this advantageous post. Carrying on negotia-
tions with Hudson Bay Company concerning a loan to France, he at the 
same time concluded a private transaction with the Company for the sale 
of cognac. In gratitude, and on behalf of the Ministry of Trade he 
assigned to the Hudson Bay Company the exclusive right for purchase of 
French goods for export. 
These were just the first steps of Monnet, which indicated, how-
ever, how easily this man foregoes the interests of his country for the 
sake of personal profits.

When the war of 1914 broke out, Monnet, using his connections with 
commercial circles, avoided service in the arrAy. The French Minister of 
Trade -- a representative of the Rothschilds -- arranged a trip for Monnet 
to London, where he participated in the organization of various Franco-
British economic committees. In the committees there arose serious con-
flicts concerning trade questions. The English especially were urgently 
achieving freedom of trade in France. And at this point) Monnet, oriented 
on "the necessary person," began to support the blockade Minister) Lord 
Robert Cecil in his disputes with the French. This unexpected support 
did not remain unnoticed by Cecil. He subsequently played a large role 
in Monnetgs career. 
In London, Monnet entered into close relations also with other peo-
ple who were necessary to him -- with Arthur Salter (subsequently Lord 
Pert)) Henri Bonnet, who later became Ambassador of France to the USA, 
with Bullitt and other American representatives, who rushed to Europe 
after the entrance of the USA into the war. Monnet sacrificed French 
interests with such ease, that the Ministers of Clemenceaugs cabinet 
insisted upon his recall from London. Soon, however, he again returned 
to London: connections with foreign capital were already at that time 
working miracles in the bourgeois political circles of France. 
The war was over. The cognac manufacturer temporarily had nothing 
to do. But he did not have to look for work long. Creating the machin-
ery for the League of Nations, Lord Cecil remembered the services) ren-
dered him by Monnet at one time. He petitioned Lloyd-George and Clemen-
ceau to appoint Monnet as deputy to the Secretary General of the League 
of Nations. There followed no objections. It was advantageous to the 
English that their man be in the League of Nations, a man who had al-
ready proved his devotion to them. As far as Clemenceau was concerned, 
he answered Cecil: "I do not believe in the League of Nations and am 
very happy to satisfy your request." 
In the League of Nations, Monnet engaged in the organization of 
all kinds of committees and subcommittees. But this was the official 
side of his activities. There was also an unofficial side: the tire-
less strengthening of his business connections with Englishmen and at 
the same time with Americans. Monnet established close contact with 
one of the partners of John Pierpont Morgan -- Dwight Morrow, who at 
one time organized the financing of Allied loans in the USA. Monnet 
also made friends with Acheson, the Future Secretary of State of USA. 
At the same time Monnet gathered about him his old London friends. 
Near him appeared Rene Pleven -- the future agent for "the European 
Army" affairs. On the whole, the activity of Monnet in the League of 
Nations was concentrated in all kinds of financial operations. He 
worked hard on the organization of loans for the Austrian Treasury and 
for the landowners of Poland, more exactly followers of Pilsudski, hav-
ing earned for himself quite tidy commissions. It was this financing 
operation which gained him wide renown on Wall Street.

In comparison with this income, service in the machinery of the 
League of Nations proved not to be a very profitable occupation. Monnet 
left Geneva and went to his native Cognac -- the affairs of the Monnet 
Cognac Firm were very much shaken; the diplomat-businessman quickly set 
about putting things right. And in this walk of life he achieved great 
successes: before the second world war the firm brought him not less 
than a million dollar income. 
Having put his cognac business back on its feet, and having provided 
himself thereby with the necessary reserve in case of any emergencies, 
Monnet again set out upon international financial ventures. Now he en-
tered the service of American bankers. The wide scope and grasp of Ameri-
can businessmen were close to his heart. In the service of the interests 
of American banks and monopolies, Monnet found his true calling. Bring-
ing him solid income, this service permitted him to consolidate and ex-
pand the business of his own firm. 
American businessmen needed an efficient Frenchman -- they were 
playing havoc with their banking operations in Europe. Monnet was 
appointed director of the Paris branch of the American investment bank 
of Blair and Co. At the head of the bank was an American Elisha Walker. 
From that time Monnet began to feel at home on WI Street. He had 
found himself in American business circles. And when the cognac manu-
facturer spoke about the business life of New 'York, in his voice were 
heard rapturous notes. 
The bank flourished. Its financial operations expanded. The 
director of its Paris branch also prospered. He became a shareholder 
of the bank. In the beginning of the 19301s this bank organized loans 
on the financial market for the rulers of Poland and Rumania at that 
time. The affairs of the bank had improved so much, that the largest 
California financier Giannini took notice of it. He appropriated the 
bank of Blair and Co 9 and created the new financial concern of Bank of 
America-Blair and Co. 
Who knows how the affairs of the new bank and Monnet would have 
proceeded, if all this had not ended in failure in 1931. The bank went 
bankrupt. But this catastrophe did not finish Monnet, or his patron 
Elisha Walker., They both succeeded in getting away, and Monnet was 
even able to preserve all his cash capital -- 3 million dollars. 
The resourcefulness of Monnet was appraised at its true worth. In 
a year, the American banks sent him to protect their interests in the 
liquidation of the Kreiger international match trust, which had failed. 
Elisha Walker became one of the directors of the American bank of Kuhn, 
Loeb and Co? the very same bank which had protected German interests 
in the USA during the entire war from 1914-1918.

During the liquidation of the match trust, Monnet, in the capacity 
of liquidator of the Kreiger trust, as appointed by the Swedish govern-
Tent, Successfully protected the interests of the American stockholders. 
After this he obtained a new appointment, again from Americans. 
In 1933 the son-in-law of Chiang Kai-shek -- the Minister of Finance 
of China -- petitioned the League of Nations to help to put right the 
system of Chinese finances. Upon the recommendation of the Americans 
in particular the bank of Morgan, Monnet was sent to Nanking. Here he 
met his old friends of the League of Nations: Henri Bonnet, Arthur 
Salter, Joseph Avenol. With their participation, there was created in 
China the China Finance Development Corporation. This company had the 
task of attracting American capital for the construction of railroads 
and electric power enterprises, and for the exploitation of the raw 
material resources of China. In other words, Monnet cleared the way for 
the penetration of American capital into China, and the enslavement of 
the Chinese people. 
Trying at least partially to protect themselves against American 
expansion,0 the Chinese bankers set up the condition: not .a single con-
struction work could be carried out without Chinese capital investments. 
Monnet assumed the task of settling this question. He went to New York. 
Together with the American George Marnain he organized there a Marnain-
Monnet Company for obtaining loans in Shanghai, New York, London, and 
Paris for tbe financing of construction work in China. Thus? Chinese 
capital was dissolved in the total sum of capital investments and 
enterprises constructed by these funds actually were not under the con-
trol of the Chinese powers. Of course, the largest amounts of capital 
were invested by Americans, which made them in essence the chief owners 
of the enterprises constructed. 
Monnet did not select his companion Marnain by chance. Through 
him he found the opportunity to expand his business connections. At 
one time Marnain was the director of the large bank of Lee Higginson. 
For a long time the bank held an important position on Wall Street; it 
participated in the financing of Germany after the first world war. 
It was one of those American banks which aided the revival of the mili-
tary power of Germany which had been destroyed in the first world war. 
It is true that after 1931, in connection with the severe economic 
crisis, Marnain had to reduce the scales of his operations for the 
financing of Germany, but he never ceased to show interest in its 
financial system. 
When the second world war broke out,, Daladier and Chamberlin 
appointed Monnet to the post of chairman of the Franco-British com-
mittee, located in London. Here Monnet again participated in danger-
ous intrigues against the interests of France. By evidence of the

American press, he was striving to realize "economic integration," that 
is, the merging of the economic resources of France with those of England. 
Under conditions when the war was being carried on at the gates of France, 
and later even on her own territory, such a merger was fraught with great 
danger for France. As one of the American magazines indicated, these 
projects led to a "still bolder idea -- the idea of political union." 
Monnet carried on negotiations in London for the unification of 
France and England into a joint French-British alliance. This project 
originated in London at the time when France was in a difficult posi-
tion in the second world war, and the City magnates intended to use this 
position of France in order to appropriate its overseas possessions and 
its navy. Jean Monnet actively helped the English realize this plan, 
whose failure it is quite impossible to attribute to a lack of effort on 
his part. 
After the capitulation of France, Monnet went to the USA with the 
British Purchasing Mission. In Washington he settled down, just as much 
at home as in France. In a comfortable _private house on Foxhall Road, 
in one of the aristocratic outskirts of the American capitol, appeared 
representatives of the higher circles -- if a person has many dollars, 
it is possible to forgive him his foreign extraction. 
Working for the English, Monnet also remained a servant of the 
Americans. When the Allies landed in North Africa, Monnet was sent by 
the American circles to investigate the situation in Morocco, Algiers 
and Tunis. Then he returned to Washington for the management of the 
French Purchasing Mission. There he remained until the very end of 
the war. He returned to France only after an end had been put to Hit-
ler. 
France had greatly suffered from the war. Her economy was seri-
ously undermined and was in need of rehabilitation and reconstruction. 
And suddenly this Jean Monnet -- who was the man who had sometimes 
served the English, sometimes the American banks and trusts, the man 
whose entire activity had been directed against the interests of his 
own country, and had threatened it with great damage -- this very same 
Monnet appeared as the author of the plan of reconstruction" of the 
French state. 
Soon afterwards it turned out that this plan was directed, first 
of all, towards restoration of the positions of those French banks and 
trusts which had wide international connections and interests beyond 
the boundaries of the country. The main burdens connected with the 
restoration, were placed on the shoulders of the workers. And the 
banks and trusts continued to enter large profits in the balances on 
their books. As concerns the fortunes of the French economy, "the two 
hundred families" who controlled France treated them very indifferently. 
They were concerned only with whether they would get their own profits.

Disregard of the national interests of the country is illustrated 
by the notorious "Marshall Plan." It brought great profits not only to 
the American bankers, but also to their French brothers in business. It 
is completely clear that Monnet -- agent of international finance cir-
cles -- promoted in every way the implementation of the Marshall Plan 
in France. On the basis of this plan, capital was invested only in 
those enterprises which were in the hands of a tight little group of 
French monopolists, which often caused damage to the national economy 
as a whole. 
But the most perfidious stab in the back of France which Monnet 
and his colleagues inflicted, was the plan for a European Union of Coal 
and Steel. The idea is- far from new. It originated in Germany. As 
far back as 1931, the German industrialist Hugo Stinnes had expressed 
it; he had dreamed of a "union" of Lorraine ore and Ruhr coke. Hitler 
had tried to realize this idea by the force of arms. After the complete 
defeat of the Hitler hordes, the idea of such a "union" migrated to the 
USA.' In 1947 John Foster Dulles declared that the Ruhr basin with its 
coal/ industrial and human resources was the economic center of Western 
Europe. 
The original version of the plan, proposed by Schuman in May 1950, 
stipulated participation in it not only of Western Germany, France, Italy 
and Benelux (that is, Belgium, Holland, and Luxemburg), but England also. 
The plan amounted to the creation of a gigantic international monopolistic 
concern, consolidating the metallurgical, iron-ore and coal industries of 
these cQuAtrios. The businessmen of the London City rei'used to partici-
pate in it, but this did not stop the author of the plan. In April 1951 
the treaty for the creation of the so-called European Union of Coal and 
Steel was signed, and went into effect in August 1952. Jean Monnet be-
came the chairman of the so-called supreme organ of the European Union 
of Coal and Steel. 
e rulers of France, disguising the, real purposes of the plans 
assured the French that the EuropeanUnion of Coal and Steel would bring 
great advantages to French industry and to the economy as a whole, They 
did nOt.conceal their intention to be the leading, determining force in 
this union. 
,ince ..that time more than four years have passed, That fruits has 
France reaped? That has her entrance into the European Union of Coal 
and Steel brought her? 
The -Schuman Plan did, damage to the French economy. Many 
. 
coal-metallurgical regions of the country, primarily Nord and Pas-de 
Calais, were hard hit.

In accordance with the Schuman Plan, during the first year of its 
operation many mines were closed as "unprofitable.? The coal trade was 
doing poorly. The European Union of Coal and Steel established uniform 
railroad rates. As a result of this "standardization" it turned out to 
be more advantageous for the Lorraine metallurgical trusts to ship coal 
from the Ruhr. And they refused to buy domestic coal. 
The picture in the French steel industry was no less joyless. Steel 
production, as is well-known, is indissolubly connected with coal. The 
coal-coking industry of France, in comparison with the Ruhr, was always 
more backward. It was in need of serious support. 
Within the limits of the European Union of Coal and Steel, France 
not only did not receive this support, but, on the contrary, immediately 
proved defenseless as compared to the more powerful Ruhr magnates. The 
Ruhr coal trusts had at their disposal the largest deposits of high grade 
coking coals in Western Europe. There were not any high grade coking 
coals in France. France, experiencing an acute shortage of coking coals, 
became completely dependent upon the Ruhr coal trusts. It is not by chance 
that the French steel industry all these years has been at a standstill, 
whereas their Western German competitors have been increasing the tempos 
of production. 
In 1957 the smelting of steel in West Germany exceeded the produc-
tion of steel in France by two times. 
Such a situation did not arise accidentally. The European Union of 
Coal and Steel opened wide opportunities to the monopolies of West German 
industry. Indeed, with the coming into effect of the Schuman Plan, all 
limitations in regard to the smelting of steel and production capacities 
lost their meaning. Entrepreneurs did not waste any time; they energeti-
cally went to work, about which the newspaper Frankfurter Algemeine  
Zeitung wrote not without exultation. It was the organ of the West Ger-
man capitalist circles. "Prom the moment of the formation of the Union 
of Coal and Steel," the newspaper declared, "West Germany was liberated 
from the fetters which had artificially kept the reconstruction of our 
metallurgical industry on a low level. Our metallurgical industry used 
the initiative which it thus obtained. In 2954 it produced the same 
quantity of steel as it had produced in 1938. This year 1955 
A. Khazanov) the prewar level will be exceeded for the first time." The 
newspaper; as is known, did not err in these predictions. 
The assertions, that the European Union of Coal and Steel would be 
able to control and limit the development of the West German war indus-
try, turned out to be idle talk. On the contrary, by means of the Euro-
pean Union of Coal and Steel West Germany began to intensify its war 
industrial potential without difficulty.

This completely suited both the West German militarists as well as 
certain circles across the ocean) who considered Nest Germany the military 
industrial base of NATO. But such a situation presented a serious threat 
for France. And this real threat was created by such people as Jean 
Monnet. It is true that at a certain stage, he abandoned these affairs, 
having given up his power as head of the European Union of Coal and Steel. 
But 3?ave already seen that this is the usual Monnet method. Having ful-
filled the immediate mission of his bosses, having set things going, he 
then withdrew into the background, not ceasing to observe behind the 
scenes and to pull one string or another opportunely. Monnet was not 
disturbed by the serious difficulties which the French economy was ex-
periencing. He could not care less -- he had plenty of deposits in Ameri-
can banks, even if all of France were to blow up. He was engaged in the 
realization of the scheme -- to transform the European Union of Coal and 
Steel into the nucleus offla United Europe." "The European Union of Coal 
and Steel," Jean'Monnet declared at one time in a public speech, "is an 
attempt to attain political results through economic means." 
What political results did this commercial traveler of "big business" 
achieve? The magazine Perspective told about this with sufficient clarity. 
"Some deliberately, others not being conscious of this," it wrote, "trans-
formed the European Union of Coal and Steel into a tool, as a result of 
which six countries of Western Europe soon formed a sacred empire under 
the American protectorate. The European Union of Goal and Steel was trans-
formed into a sword directed against the USSR) covering itself by the 
existing necessity of organizing the struggle against communism, of organ-
izing a crusade to the East." This was the attractiveness of this plan 
for Monnet, and those whom he served. 
As concerns "the crusade to the East," Mr. Monnet, still, as the 
saying goes, proceeded on the basis of "we shall see what we shall see." 
At that time it was not easy to arrange such crusades. The experience 
of events of the recent past very clearly indicated that attempts of 
imperialists to organize anti-national conspiracies and military adven-
tures end up in disgraceful failure. 
There is hardly anyone who is not clear on who was guilty of aggres-
sion against Egypt, and of the rise of the counter-revolutionary revolt 
in Hungary. 
This was a unified plan, conceived on a wide scale. Its authors 
meant, in two blows, to change to their own benefit the situation on 
the world scene. However, they did not calculate correctly) having 
overestimated their forces and having underestimated the forces of the 
camp of socialism and also the forces of the national-liberation move-
ment in the countries of the East. They obviously miscalculated and 
received a two-fold crushing blow. The lessons of the adventure in the

Arab East indicate that the colonizers suffered a military, economic, and 
moral-political defeat. In Hungary the people, under the leadership of 
the Hungarian Socialist Labor Party and the Revolutionary Worker-Peasants 
Government, with the aid of the Soviet Union quickly defeated the counter-
revolutionary conspirators. The defeat of the counter-revolutionary re-
volt in Hungary, which was inspired from without; and also the defeat of 
the aggressor in Egypt meant the great failure of the imperialistic course 
of the policy "from the position of strength." This is the fate of some 
of "the campaigns" about which Mr. Monnet and company had dreamed. These 
dreams were fantastic. And here is the stark reality: French industry 
on the decline, Italian metallurgy almost completely ruined; instead of 
"the general market," there resulted the closed market of West German 
monopolies and their senior American partners; monopolies of West Germany 
got into the overseas possessions of France, and especially into North 
Africa. Under heart-rending wails about the contrived *communist threat," 
France was not only fleeced, but her national interests were subordinated 
to the interests of West German revanchism. And Jean Monnet was one of 
the chief organizers of such a deplorable process for France. 
Having placed upon France the yoke of the European Union of Coal and 
Steel, Monnet and people of his type set about petitioning for the organi-
zation of the so-called "united market" and "Euratom." All of those same 
six countries -- the participants of the Schuman Plan, including France 
also, had to go into either of these organizations. In essence, the term 
"united market" implies the elimination of economic boundaries between 
these six states. The participants of the union are called upon to give 
up some fundamental functions of state sovereignty, having yielded them 
to "the super-national organs of the union." Behind these organs, of 
course, stand the West German monopolies. The "general market" opens 
for West Germany, which possesses a powerful economic potential) the 
opportunity to establish its hegemony in Western Europe. 
The matter of "Euratom" is still more serious. Of course, it is 
disguised by every possible decent mask. This) it is said, is collabora-
tion of the six countries in the interests of the peaceful use of atomic 
energy. Actually it is a completely different issue. The treaty con-
cerning the creation of "Euratom" stipulates the unification of atomic 
research, the production of atomic raw material? the use of atomic energy, 
and the joint financing of enterprises and plants in this field. 
It must be taken into consideration that West Germany joined the 
Union, but has no atomic raw material of its own; and on the other hand, 
France and Belgium joined the Union, and they do possess their own atomic 
raw material. For whom, then, is this collaboration advantageous? The 
West German revanchists will have access to atomic raw material and actu-
ally will be freed from any limitations in the field of production of 
atomic weapons.

The "Common Denominator of Mr. Spaak M0 Sturua 
-Some American journalists once asked Paul Henri Spaak what the secret 
of hi S political career was. The secret consists of *patience and an ar-
dent desire to find the common denominator," Paul Henri answered without 
a trace of irony. 
Spaak possesses to perfection this wisdom, which Saltykov-Shchedrtri 
maliciously and accurately nicknamed by the famous words -- to act "in 
conformity with baseness." With the ease and effortlessness of the pro-
fessional illusioner he reduces to "a common denoMinator" the ultra-
patriotic tirades, and trades in the sovereignty of Belgium, "the social-
ist convictions" and the appetites of the colonizer, the verbiage about 
peace, and the possession of shares of military concerns. 
At the dawn of his hazy political youth) Mr. Spaak was considered 
an inveterate rebel -- "a left" socialist. He even practiced law) de-
fending in the courts people prosecuted for political offenCes against 
capitalism. 
The peak of *the revolutionary" activity of the young socialist was 
his participation in a street demonstration at the building of the con-
servative newspaper Nation Beige. Passing the editorial offices of this 
newspaper, he broke the glass of one of the windows with a cane. 
, "The revolutionary act" of Spaak did not cause a Belgian reaction, 
or the slightest damage. It easily recovered from this blow -- the 
editorial office of Nation Beige placed an iron grating on the windows. 
Even up to the present time, it is pointed out to tourists. It is 
called "the Spaak grating."

But the period of "storm and stress" was short. The experience con-
verted Spaak into a socialist, who adhered to the constitution," wrote the 
English journalist Mac Hicky. Only the black wide-brimmed hat, looked 
upon as a sign of radicalism in Western Europe, of its right-wing social-
ist owner reminded one of the former convictions of this socialist. 
In 19,37 Spaak became Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belgium. He 
obtained the ministerial portfolio during the years when, over Europe, 
the we fires had started. The Rhine area was remilitarized, the Saar 
was annexed to Germany, Austria stood on the threshold of the auschloss. 
In Spain, Hitler and Mussolini, helping Franco conduct war against the 
Spanish people, were rehearsing the conquest of Europe. The Ministries 
of Foreign Affairs in London and Paris, counting on the fact that Hitler 
would turn to the east, not only did not hamper the raving lance-corporal, 
but, on the contrary, roused his appetites. Austria and Czechoslovakia 
were absorbed by the German Third Empire. The Munich capitulation became 
a prelude to the capitulation of Compeigne forest. The second world war 
broke out. At first "a strange war," then a frightful war. 
:t 'was Paul Henri Spaak doing during these years? According to 
Spaak himself, he was trying to convert Belgium into a second Switzerland 
and 0;* this purpose had achieved recognition of Belgium's constant neu-
trality from Germany. But this was obviously ostrich feather politics. 
Who does not remember that the Kaiser's Germany had come forward as 
one of the guarantors of Belgium's neutrality? This by no means prevented 
Wilhelm II frop giving the order to invade Belgium, and to occupy it. 
Justifying the violation of neutrality, the German government of that time 
declar9d to the Belgian government that France was a dangerous threat to 
Belgium. In view of the inability of Belgium to protect herself independ-
ently from this threat, it was said in the statement, German armed forces 
would enter Belgian territory. In this pert document, composed, inci-
dentally, according to that inveterate militarist General von Moltke, 
? only as a mockery, Belgium was guaranteed "integrity and independence." 
?gartoon opp. p /44g Everyone remembers how these "guarantees" for 
Belgium turned out. Also the director of her foreign policy, Spaak, had 
to remember this. Nevertheless he humbly begged for new uguaranteesu 
from Hitler's Minister of Foreign Affairs Ribbentrop. The entreaties 
were heard in Berlin. Hitler gave Belgium "solemn guarantees" of the 
inviolability and respect of its neutrality. But the German General 
Staff received the mission to work out a plan, of attack upon this coun-
try. 
The preparation Of paper guarantees proceeded at full speed. Soon 
Spaak'inserted into his diplomatic assets new guarantees, the guarantees 
of the England and France who had been at Munich.

Seeking after illusory guarantees, Spaak exerted every effort for 
the frustration of the real guarantees of security, included in the effi-
cient system of collective security, whose creation the Soviet Union had 
achieved at that time. Speaking on 11 May 1954 at the Geneva Conference) 
the Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs pathetically exclaimed: "Namely 
here, in Geneva...I was witness to the destruction of collective security. 
I shall never forget this -- the destruction of collective security was 
the prelude to the second world war." He preferred to pass over in silence 
the fact that his own role in this shameful matter went far beyond the 
limits of a detached onlooker. It suffices to point out, that Spaak was 
the first to recognize the fascist government of Franco, and actively par-
ticipated in the conversion of the League of Nations into a farces 
The reckoning soon came. It was in the person of Beulow-Shvante, 
the German Ambassador in Brussels. Beulow-Shvante came to the Belgian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and read a note on the invasion of Belgium 
by Germany. This occurred several hours after units of the Hitler 
Wermacht crossed the Belgian border, having trampled on "the guarantees," 
which had been begged by Speak at one time. 
Having heard out Beulow-Shvante, Spaak burst into a verbose mono-
logue. He branded Germany as ungrateful and even showed the Ambassador 
the door. But not without reason do they say about Speak, that, "when 
a crisis comes, the thinker in him yields to the man of action." Hav-
ing showed Hitlerls Ambassador the door, he became frightened. And hav-
ing become frightened, he began to act. According to the evidence of 
the former commander of the Hitler army in Belgium, General FAlkenkhausen) 
Spaak offered his services to the Hitler command. However his "offers 
of collaboration" were declined. Falkenkhausen preferred a pure Belgian 
Quisling -- the leader of the "Reichists," De Grelle. 
Speak left Belgium, since he had nothing to do. Turned away by 
Hitler and Shown much kindness in London, he nevertheless preferred) for 
the time being, to mark time) to back two horses -- the outcome of the 
war was still not determined. Speaking on 6 December 1940 on the London 
radio) he appealed to the Belgians to keep, their loyalty to King Leopold 
who had betrayed his country, and had turned into an inveterate col-
laborationist. "Everyone, who had taken an oath of loyalty to the king)" 
overstraining his voice, Spaak laid down the law) "must keep this oath." 
But Hitlers Germany was defeated. Spaak returned to Brussels. Now 
there appeared a new rival for him, still more dangerous than the un-
lucky De Grelle. This was Mr. Van Zeeland. In Belgium Spaak and Van 
Zeeland were called "the brothers-enemies.* The French magazine Democracy-
Nouvelle wrote about them: "In Belgium two men especially are obtaining

The struggle of Spaak with Van Zeeland was not easy. Not for nothing 
do they consider, in the USA, that Van Zeeland is 'the most American of 
Belgian statesmen.? However the rivalry of these "brother-enemies" ended 
up with the victory of Spaak. Since then he definitively and irrevocably 
bound his fate with American imperialism, having become its faithful and 
obedient servant. 
Zpaak was born in Belgium. But "Belgium is too small for such a big 
operator, as Speak," the London radio once noted. In this assertion, there 
is a speck of truth -- in Belgium there is no person who would be able to 
permit himself the luxury of buying Speak. 
This luxury was accessible for the gentlemen of Washington. 
Speak became an active executor of the schemes of the American imperi-
alists, who were striving to deprive the European countries of their na-
tional sovereignty and to convert all of Europe into the forty-ninth State 
of Ameriea, 
Devoid of "national prejudices," Spaak first of all worked on Belgium. 
How much-eWert was expended by him in order to draw this country into 
Western European "defense" groups A "The socialist, who adheres to the 
constitution," took an active part in castrating the Belgian constitution. 
Articles 25 and 68 were radically revised. These articles deal with the 
national sovereignty of Belgium, the fundamental rights of the nation, 
its sovereign power. The Minister of Internal Affairs of Belgium, at that 
time Moyerson, frankly recognized, that this revision had been undertaken 
for the purpose of the establishment of "super national power' within the 
limits of the "European defense" organization. Spaak was one of the first 
to vote for the actual elimination of the constitution and the sovereignty 
of Belgium. 
The voting in parliament did not reflect, of course, the real opinion 
of the Belgian people. In a special study of public opinion on "the West 
German defense organization," 70 percent of those asked declared that they 
were against such an organization. That was the real will of the Belgian 
people. Displaying the sovereignty of Belgium for sale, Speak was deal-
ing in something which did not belong to him. 
Having forgotten about the Hohenzollern "guarantees" and about his 
personal experience with the Hitler "guarantees,' Spaak again tried to 
drag Belgium onto a path fraught with catastrophe, full of guarantees-
traps. This time it concerns the "guarantees" of Adenauer. With undis-
guised admiration he cites the words of the Bonn Chancellor that "the 
European defense association must be the starting point for the system 
of defense, which takes into consideration the need of all European na-
tions for security." The Belgian Minister, moreover, was deliberately 
shutting his eyes to the aggressive preparations of the West German

militarists. He did not want to remember, that during the years of the 
second world war the German General Staff had sent barges to the Belgian 
ports whose dark holds were crowded with soldiers of the Wermacht. At 
the appointed hour they stabbed the Belgian defense forces in the back. 
Having ratified the treaty concerning the "European Army," and after 
its failure, the Paris agreements, the rulers of Belgium thus actually 
sanctioned the future occupation of its territory by the West German 
Wermacht that has now been created. Speaking at one time in parliament 
on the question of ratification of the treaty concerning "the European 
Army," the Minister of National Defense de Greve had to admit, that 
the Belgians would have to agree, possibly, to the merger of their di-
visions with German divisions." De Greve confirmed that this could lead 
to the placing of German troops in Belgium. 
The Bonn neo-Wermacht would not even need barges -- the Belgian 
Speaks were ready themselves to throw open the doors to the German di-
visions. 
* * * 
In October 19531 in the Hague, there was held a meeting of the regu-
lar congress of the so-called movement for the,unification of Europe. 
At this congress occurred the solemn handing over of "European passport 
po9 l" to Paul Henri Spaak, chairman of the assembly of "the European 
Union of Coal and Steel." 
Spaak completely deserved this "license no. 1 for trading in sover-
eignty." "The organized international life, which we are achieving," 
he "theorizes," "cannot be attained, if we do not destroy the dogma 
of absolute state sovereignty. A real international organization and 
absolute national sovereignty are contradictory and irreconcilable con-
cepts." Sovereignty, Spaak said authoritatively, is anarchy; the rejec-
tion of sovereignty is order. 
Spaak began to achieve "the organized international life" the day 
after the defeat of Hitlerge Germany. He became one of the creators of 
the movement for "the Union of Europe." It was he who proposed the crea-
tion of "a European Council" for the drawing up of a constitution of the 
future "European Federation." The name of Spaak invariably figures among 
the inventors of all these artificial constructions: "United Europe," 
"the European Council," "the European Political Association," "Little 
Europe," "the European Union of Coal and Steel," "the Social Movement for 
the Creation of the United States of Europe," "the European Union for 
Rapprochement with the USA," "the European Defense Association." In 
spite of the variety of labels, they all pursue the very same goal -- to 
deprive the countries of Western Europe of national sovereignty and inde-
pendence.

Spaak infinitely hates the state boundaries of the Western European 
countries -- indeed they impede free American penetration. "Down with 
fifteen state boundaries," he proclaimed. For him only one boundary 
was important. "The boundary of the USA," declared Spaak: "passes 
through Europe." "We should have gotten rid of the prejudices and old-
fashioned traditions a long time ago...The attempt to coordinate the indi-
vidual activity of 15 different countries -- is a completely inadequate 
method,.." 
What kind of a method did Spaak consider "adequate"? This is the 
kind of method: "We shall not solve the vitally important problem of 
security until we develop a plan and until we create. ..a united army of 
the countries of the Atlantic treaty. We need, as soon as possible, a 
man who has much experience, influence and prestige, to be at the head 
of this work....He would not only be the Commander-in-Chief, but, if it 
can be expressed thus, also the general war minister for these countries." 
General Eisenhower was such a "war minister," then General Ridgeway 
became "war minister." Then General Gruenther had the role of military 
governor-general of Western Europe. Now General Norstad in this same role 
is functioning as the regular American Commander of the Armed Forces of 
NATO. Spaak was obsequiously frank in the pages of the reputable Ameri-
can magazine Foreign Affairs: "I always have wanted the United States to 
use its power and its interest in the welfare of Europe, in order to give 
our continent a shove towards unification." But what a unionl "I should 
welcome the manifestation of even more boldness," he recklessly exclaimed 
in that same magazine. 
And, there is no denying the consistency of the Belgian minister-
socialist -- if instead of 15 European boundaries there must exist one 
-- the American, if instead of 15 European currencies there must remain 
one -- also the American, then is it not logical to offer all of these 
15 European countries also one master -- America? 
These glorifications in honor of the American Uncle Sam make up one 
of the basic melodies of the propagandistic street-organ of the Belgian 
socialist. 
Having gone to the shores of the Hudson, where, according to his 
own declaration he liked everything except "the very monotonous food," 
Spaak became very enthusiastic over "the changes in the class structure" 
of the USA. It turns out that in the USA "millionaires are gradually 
disappearing, and capitalism is achieving, in reality, socialist ends." 
But in spite of this demagogy, the workers of Europe more and more 
distinctly understand, that in the USA the millionaires are not disap-
pearing, but rather the democratic freedoms are disappearing, that the 
bosses of Wall Street are striving towards the achievement not of social-
ist goals, but of world supremacy.

Spaak was having difficulties "In Western Europe there is notice-
able an anti-American trend, which in my opinion, has become intensified 
recently," he complained in an interview in the newspaper pagbiadet. 
Speaking at one of the "Europe-USA" congresses, Spaak expressed himself 
far more frankly: "Several million Europeans," he said, "subjected to 
doubt and mockery the values in which we believe more than in anything 
else....For the majority of Europe, America means Chicago gangsters and 
New York multi-millionaires. Our task is to show the likeable face of 
America." But even that propagandist cosmetic, with which Spaak tried 
to make up the face of monopolistic America, did not make it more attrac-
tive. 
* * * 
With unusual ease Spaak sacrificed what he himself called "the 
vital interests of the Europeans." In the American magazine Foreign  
Affairs, he wrote: "Europe must be reconstructed; but the reconstruc-
tion of Europe means at first the infringement of some lawful interests. 
Here and there it may create, for some time, unemployment. It may mean 
the destruction of individual personalities and some groups." Speaking 
in 1952 at the Hague, Spaak called for "the sacrifice of European pride, 
sovereignty, and material sacrifices." 
Let no one be surprised at this sham altruism: the reconstruction 
of Europe for which Spaak was calling, would not infringe upon his own 
interests. Whomever unemployment and ruin might threaten, they would 
not threaten Spaak. Waiving the sovereignty of his homeland, he did 
not make any personal sacrifices. On the contrary, he made a fortune. 
Here are the facts. Before the beginning of the debates in the 
special commission created in Belgium to study the question of the 
ratification of the treaty for "the European Defense Association," 
Cowen, the Ambassador of the USA in Brussels, gave Spaak to understand 
that the Belgian export firms with which Spaak was closely connected, 
would receive profitable American orders if the Belgian parliament 
would ratify the treaty in 1953. The deal went through? SpaalOs firms 
received profitable orders. 
When the American intervention in Korea began, Spaak was beside 
himself with joy. "I approve of the action of the United States in 
Korea," said he, transported with enthusiasm. Five years later, speak-
ing at the Geneva Conference on the Korean Question, Spaak declared 
with affected disinterestedness: "In such a war as the warmn Korea, 
there is nothing for us to defend except principles." Is that really 
the case, Mr. Speak? A careful study of some aspects of his biography 
indicates that "the principles" of this man lie in his safe in the form 
of a considerable packet of shares of the National Armaments Plant.

The arms dealers and their salesmen of the government attained their 
end -- the conference was frustrated. The stockholders of the National 
Armaments Plant continued to make a fortune in the production of weapons 
of death and destruction. 
The events of those years throw a bright light upon the sources of 
friendship of the Armaments Plant and its stockholder Spaak with American 
military firms and the US State Department. 
This friendship, mixed in the yeast of the international tension, 
became especially close during the years of the Korean adventure of Ameri-
can imperialism. It is continuing to become stronger even now. It is 
growing together with the increase of the price of shares of the National 
Armaments Plant. In 1948 a share of this concern cost 600 francs; after 
six years it was worth 3,000 francs. In 1948-1949 the dividend of the 
National Armaments Plant amounted to 65 francs per each share. After 
five years it reached 1925. francs, 
This is where it is necessary to search for those "principles," in 
whose defense Mr, Spaak drove his countrymen to Korea, The specialists 
recognized the Belgian rifle, produced by the National Armaments Plant 
as the best, and it was accepted as the equipment of the forces of the 
North Atlantic bloc. This decision caused a sharp influx of orders to 
the plant. The people, to whom this decision was whispered in time, be-
came fabulously rich in a short period. Among those who became rich 
was Paul Henri Spaak -- one of the principal stockholders of the National 
Armaments Plant in Herstal. 
How did the "socialist" Spaak become converted into a large stock-
holder of a war enterprise? The Berlin evening paper BTS Am Abend wrote 
that a large cash bonus received by Spaak for his active support of "the 
Schuman Plan" helped him to make his way among the arms manufacturers, 
Thus Spaak acquired on the Brussels Exchange shares of the National Arma-
ments Plant. 
The owners of the plant were glad to get for themselves such a 
"socialist" as a partner. The close connections of Spaak with the over-
seas organizations of the arms race promised them large war orders, 
critical war materials, credits. 
Not just the one company made use of Spaakus services. Spaak also 
obtained large American orders for the Dille Automobile Company, of 
which he was also a stockholder. 
Spaak made use of the American sops not only for personal enrich-
ment. The center of "the European movement," which was in Brussels and 
directed by the Belgian Socialist Party, was financed from American loans 
obtained by "the European Union of Coal and Steel."

"The American war orders are a bridge, thrown between our two conti-
nents," the former Prime Minister of Belgium Van Gutt once declared in 
Ghent at the international exhibition on the occasion of "American Day." 
In Belgium this bridge -- the heavy burden of the armaments race -- lies 
on the Shoulders of Belgian workers. The military expenditures of Belgium 
amount to the huge figure of 21 billion francs. Speaking on the radio, 
The Minister of Finance of Belgium declared: "From Brussels to Malin is 
21 kilometers. If there were placed along the road from Brussels to the 
Great SquAre of Malines at each ten centimeters a packet of 100 1,000 
franc notes, then the total sum of 21 billion francs would be obtained." 
How many of these packets would fall to the lot of Mr. Spaak? When the 
newspaper Drapeau Rouge suggested that he tell about his connections with 
the National Armaments Plant, Spaak preferred to keep silent. 
,But this silence was more eloquent than many words. The fact is 
that, in dealing in European sovereignty and earning for himself popu-
larity with the American Uncle Sam, Spaak was reducing everything to 
"a common denominator" -- to war. 
-"The approaching peace worries me," Spaak frankly said during the 
second world war. With time, this anxiety developed into a real mania. 
"Korea is only an episode, a warning that it is necessary to hurry...," 
declared Spaak. 
And the aggressors began to hurry. The cities and villages of 
Egypt burst into flame, The tragedy of Port Said shook the world. All 
humanity held up to shame the interventionists-colonizers who had in-
vaded Egyptian territory. The overwhelming majority of the countries 
-- the members of the UN -- censured the actions of the Anglo-Franco 
Israeli aggressors. 
But Belgium was not among them. Not because the Belgian people 
approved of this base aggression, but because Spaak represented Belgium. 
The lechery of "the demagogue in dinner-jacket" (thus Spaakos 
political opponents had nicknamed him) reached its peak at the Eleventh 
Session of the UN General Assembly. Headlong, he rushed to the tribune 
to save his bosses, who had entangled themselves and exposed themselves 
before the whole world. Spaak, foaming at the mouth, spoke in support 
of the colonizers from the high tribune of the Assembly. 
In order to divert attention from this disgraceful colonizer ad-
venture of his partners, Spaak? together with his protector -- the USA 
-- undertook a roundabout maneuver. Onto the agenda of the UN General 
Assembly was juggled the provocative "Hungarian question." How Spaak 
excelled in anti-Soviet slander, how he openly fraternized with the 
Hungarian fascist-counterrevolutionaries, how he tried to slander and

cast slurs upon the great camp of socialism, and at the very same time 
:whitewash the executioners who had organized the slaughter in the streets 
ofJiludapest!, Acting "in eonformity with low-down action," Spaak indeed 
surpassed himself. 
This did not pass unnoticed. 
'In December 19560 at the regular meeting of the NATO council in Paris, 
the Belgian socialist Paul Henri Spaak was chosen Secretary General of 
the North Atlantic bloc. Even the history of right-wing socialism, a 
history which is not so poor in facts of desertion, degeneration, and 
grovelling before capital, does not remember such an individoe1.0 
In appointing Spaak as Secretary General of NATO0 Washington was 
counting on galvanizing the idea of "European unity." Not for nothing 
was the session of the Council of the Atlantic bloc convened at the same 
time as the Conference of the Western European Union in Paris. For the 
Washington bosses of NATO the subordination of the armies to the Pentagon, 
the militarization of the economies of Western Europe were not enough. 
They wanted to convert these countries into colonies of the USA, deprived 
of sovereignty, independence, sovereign state independence. For this all, 
new attempts were undertaken to galvanize the still-born Western European 
Union. Who other than Spaak, the holder of "European passport no. 1," 
would be entrusted with this mission? 
The appointment to the new post brought out in Spaak a new fit of 
hatred for sovereignty, of servility before the American monopolies. In 
his very first public address, the newly brought-to-light Secretary Gen-
eral of NATO declared that he did not see any contradiction in the dec-
laration by Dullest that all the members of the North Atlantic pact must 
come to an agreement with the USA about their policy and must consult 
with the USA, but that the United States does not have to do this in its 
relations with members of NATO. "Ultimately," pathetically exclaimed 
Speak, "it would be impossible to expect that such a country as the USA, 
with its international obligations, would promis4 to consult with such 
a small country as Belgium on every problem which it might encounter in 
some region of the earth." It is difficult to say, what there is more 
of in this declaration of Spaak servile obsequiousness before the 
American Uncle Sam, or lordly contempt for his own country. , 
Having become secretary General of NATO, Spaak started a new in
-- this time with the atomic bomb. Not just anywhere, but in 
Bonn on the eve of the MAY 1957 session of the Gouncil,of the Atlantic 
Union, he ted the journalists, that "the huge destructive power of the 
nuclear weapon is for us the best guarantee of peace." 
...A guarantee again. Here indeed: can the leopard change his 
spots?

At the same time, Spaak with even greater zeal led the attack against 
the sovereignty of the Western European countries. He was an indispensable 
participant of all the conferences for the drawing up of treaties for the 
creation of "Euratom" and "the total European market." 
Speak could be seen at Lancaster House in London, at the conference 
of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the six countries -- the future 
participants of these unions. Then the ministers and the premiers attached 
to them met at the Matignon Hotel in Paris. Finally, the conspirators 
against the interests of Europe took shelter in the castle of Valle 
Duchesse in Belgium. There under the chairmanship of Spaak were drawn 
up coordinated plans, which were signed later in Rome. 
"We are happy, as parents at the birth of a child," he hastened to 
inform the representatives of the press. The participants of the confer-
ence at the palace of Valle Duchesse chose Spaak as head of the interim 
committee for the acceleration of work for the putting into effect of the 
treaties for the creation of "Euratom" and "the total European market." 
-1Thus "the socialist," the Secretary General of the war bloc of im-
perialists headed by the USA, Spaak, reduced to an American "common de-
nominator" the Western European countries.

The years after the second world war signified the universal-

new socialist States, the downfall of the century-old colonial syStem. 
This was the most profound crisis of capitalism, the last stage of 
imperialism

Denying the regularity of the historic process, the capitalists nour-
ish hopes for the restoration of the capitalist and colonial system. For 
this reason, the ruling circles of the USA and England, and behind them 
also other imperialists are striving to preserve everything that still 
remained from the colonial world. 
One such fragment of colonialism is the Island of Taiwan. Here, 
established firmly, is Chiang Kai-shek, the recollection of whom would 
have been blotted out in China and in the whole world, if he had not 
been made a pawn in the large and gambling game of war. 
Chiang Kai-shek personifies the history of the parasitic existence 
and inglorious downfRil of the peculiar variety of colonial bourgeoisie 
the,compradors, 
. This Class was the support of the imperialists in the colonies. It 
suffered,a crushing defeat in the national liberation wars of the peoples. 
To indicate how the political career of Chiang Kai-shek rose in a 
bloody fog and how it set, means to reveal those historic premises which 
determined ,the greatest historic victory of the Chinese people, of the 
Comml,141.0 arty of China, the liberation of the great Chinese state from 
the y6ke of the imperialists of England, Japan, and USA, and of internal 
reaction. Chiang Kai-shek himself was a complete nonentity. He has re-
mained... nonentity up to the present. But in his behalf acts the Chiang 
Kai-shek w,in the United Nations. His piratic flag flies over the 
island torn_away from China, and which was converted into a piratels 
nest. The Chiang Kai-shek army, equipped by the government of the USA, 
is considered by American strategists as a shock detachment of the im-
perialists. 
?All.thisdoes_not make it possible to forget Chiang Kai-shek, to 
efface him from the memory of the people, and from the list of the most 
malicious warmongers. At the same time the story about the downfOl of 
Chiang Kai-shek is, a clear picture of the hopelessness of the new colo-
nialism spread by the USA.

By the time, when in the family of a salt merchant, the childhood 
of ,Chiang Kai-spek ended, the people of China had been conducting a 
strained revolutionary struggle for a half century against foreign 
imperialism and despotic Chinese feudalism. Pressing wars upon China 
or threatening China with war, the American, Japanese, French, and 
German imperialists forced the rulers of China to sign enslaving agree-
ments0 they thrust upon China a colonial regime, seized Chinese terri-
tories, created special settlements in the country, led their troops

into China; literally, this was not a great sovereign state with a century-
old culture, but their colony. They plundered the natural resources of 
the country. 
Whoever the imperialists might have been, who, at a given time held 
the most important place in the colonial plundering of China, their pro-
gram in general was one and the same: the enslavement of the people, 
inhuman exploitation, plunder of the natural resources, and retention of 
the age-old economic and cultural backwardness. 
The imperialists ruled with the aid of the Chinese rich men, who 
had become obliging agents of foreign companies. Thus arose the com-
paratively numerous cadres of the compradors, the parasitic bourgeoisie 
who acted on behalf of the colonizers, who served the imperialists, who 
betrayed its own people. These compradors? who multiplied especially in 
the large port cities -- Shanghai, Canton, Tsingtao, formed the most reac-
tionary part of the Chinese bourgeoisie. The people had the same hate 
for them which they felt for all foreign enslavers0 
oppressing the Chinese peotae the imperialists could 
not hOweverr, in spite of their will and 'their intentions) , 
in the course of the inevitable historical development could not stifle 
the process of the economic awakening of China. 
There arose cadres of the industrial and transport Chinese prole-
tariat; there began to appear small factories of the national bourgeoisie, 
who was interested in the extensive development and independence of Chinese 
industry. Still weak and depending upon foreign and comprador capital, 
this part of the bourgeoisie was already dreaming about domination in the 
market. 
A huge revolutionary force was born in China together with the forma-
tion of cadres of the industrial proletariat. It had a historic mission: 
to head the revolutionary movement in the country, to unite all the oppo-
sition forces against colonialism, and to lead them to the storming of 
imperialism and the feudal-comprador forces. 
In the beginning of the 20th century the foreign imperialists intensi-
fied their oppression. They tore into parts the living body of China. 
Japan started the armed seizure of entire regions -- the Iwangtung area 
and the Liaotung Peninsula. England invaded Tibet, the English and French 
troops were led into the Yunnan province. Foreign monopolistic capital 
seized key positions in the Chinese economy. In China there predominated 
the English Hong Kong-Shanghai Bank, the German-Asia Bank, the French Bank 
of Indo-China, the American banking consortium, created by the banks of 
Wall Street: John P. Morgan, Kuhn-Loeb and Co. and others.

The Chinese people never became reconciled to this enslavement. The 
country rose up for the struggle against the foreign imperialists and 
local feudalism. This struggle led to the revolutionary outburst in 1911 
which put an end to the feudal-monarchial system in China. In Nanking, 
the Chinese republic was proclaimed. Under the pressure of the foreign 
imperialists, the Chinese bourgeoisie gave up the power to that very same 
feudal clique which had predominated during the monarchy. The militarist 
and feudal lord Yuan Shih-k8ai was proclaimed president. But the real 
power in the country belonged to several militarist cliques. 
The imperialists furthered the parcelling out -- it is easier to 
plunder and to oppress a country when there is not a united will, a united 
power in it. If someone of the small rulers gathered forces, another ruler 
was set upon him. In the country, as formerly, the landowners-feudal lords 
predominated. In the cities the compradors swarmed in a parasitic horde. 
But the revolutionary national movement, the struggle of the workers 
and peasants did not cease. It was becoming clear that the revolution was 
only beginning, and that the masses of the people would not become recon-
oiled to the power of the militarists. 
The great October Socialist Revolution opened a new epoch of the 
victorious struggle of the colonial peoples and the dependent countries 
against foreign and domestic oppressors. It indicated the correct way 
to the Chinese people. "The gun volleys of the October Revolution brought 
Marxism-Leninism to us," wrote Mao Tse-tung. The October Revolution 
helped the progressive elements of peace, and helped China to apply the 
proletarian world outlook for the determination of the fate of the country 
and a reconsideration of its own problems. The conclusion was to proceed 
along the way of the Russians.

was the beginning of a wave of strikes. There developed an anti-feudal, 
anti-imperialistic movement for the national independence of the country. 
The bourgeois-democratic Chinese revolution was placed upon a new road 
-- it was converted into a democratic revolution? directed by the prole , 
tariat. 
Rising for the struggle for social and national liberation, the 
Chinese working class created its own Communist Party, which led the 
whole Chinese people to the universal-historic victory in the revolu-
tionary movement. In July 1921, in Shanghai, there was held the First 
Congress of the Communist Party. The matter of the struggle of the 
Chinese people for emancipation was in reliable hands. The Chinese 
Communist Party," wrote the well-known Chinese scholar Ch en Bo-dal, 
"became the all-national leader of the anti-imperialistic and anti-
feudal democratic revolution. It called for the establishment of a 
united revolutionary front of different classes against imperialism 
and feudalism."

This appeal found a response. Profound social-class changes in the 
country, the experience of the revolutionary struggle of the people caused, 
by that time, great changes within the Kuomintang, created in 1912 by 
Sun Yat-sen. The right-wing, most reactionary group deserted Sun Yat-sen. 
The left-wing group united under the leadership of Sun Yat-sen. 
Life, the experience of the revolutionary struggle, taught this great 
democrat that without ,collaboration with the best forces of the country 
-- with the Communist Party, without alliance with the USSR, without the 
support for the genuinely revolutionary forces of the people, the workers, 
and peasants -- it is impossible to achieve victory in the bourgeois-
democratic revolution. Loyalty to the interests of the people, an under-
standing of their needs, of the most urgent tasks of the revolutionary 
movement, led Sun Yat-sen to the correct conclusions. At the very same 
time, the Communist Party, using the valuable experience of the Russian 
revolution, applied the correct tactics. The Third Congress of the Com-
munist Party of China adopted, in the summer of 1923, the resolution on 
the entry of the Communists into the Kuomintang, with the preservation 
by the Communist Party of political and organizational independence. 
This led to the revival and activization of the Kuomintang. At its 
First Congress, held in January 1924, a united national front took shape 
in the country. The Congress gave the correct interpretation of the three 
national principles of Sun Yat-sen. The first principle was "nationalism" 
-- the struggle against imperialism, the second was "sovereignty of the 
people" -- the establishment of a democratic republic; the third was 
"national prosperity" -- the allotment of land to the peasants, the limi-
tation of large monopolistic capital, the support of the workers move-
ment. 
The three national principles were supplemented by the three princi-
pal political goals: alliance with the USSR, alliance with the Communist 
Party, the support of the workers and peasants. 
The revolutionary movement in China grew, expanded, developed. It 
took the form of revolutionary civil wars against the rule of the feudal-
militaristic cliques. 
At this time, there appeared the young militarist Chiang Kai-shek. 
After the example of other sons of the Chinese bourgeoisie, he was edu-
cated in Japan. He was graduated from the Japanese Military Academy in 
1906. Here he had mastered not only the cult of the sword, contempt of 
the workers, but also dreams about the rule in China of the bourgeois 
military clique. This was "the nationalism" of the reactionary youth. 
Putting on a mask Chiang Kai-shek joined the Sun Yat-sen "Union 
League." He wanted to lean upon the national-democratic movement. He 
succeeded in ingratiating himself with the leaders of the new revolu-
tionary society. The future comprador had his own secret plans. He 
perceived the revolutionary movement only as a means to the achievement 
of personal power, and power -- as the means to wealth.

Chiang Kai-shek was dying for profit. At the most difficult time 
for the revolution, 1918, he deserted its ranks and set off for Shanghai 
-- to speculate on the exchange in the company of his partner and relative 
Ch en Kuo-fu. The biographers of the young exchange speculators servilely 
wrote about this period of his life: "Moving in commercial circles, he 
always acted correctly, and in a short time, having struck a number of 
profitable bargains, became a rich merchant." 
Speculating on the exchange, where sharp practice was considered a 
talent, and deception, brutality and treachery -- normal professional 
qualities, Chiang Kai-shek became closely connected with the criminal 
underground of ,Shanghai ?tlebrutalChing-PangSociety.? The bandits of 
this gang kidnapped people for the purpose of obtaining ransom, and en-
gaged in murders. The "society" had a large system of smugglers, dealers 
in opium, suppliers of "live goods." Foreign imperialists extensively 
used the services of such terrorist bands. Here, in the Tsinban, Chiang 
Kai-shek went through the school of treason and betrayal. Chiang Kai-shek 
spent five years in the corrupted, unprincipled and dishonorable environ-
ment of the compradors. He understood F01 the secrets of the banking in-
trigues. The golden cupola of the temple of profit, of the majestic 
building of the omnipotent Shanghai-Hong Kong Bank irrepressibly attracted 
him. 
The young businessman undertook a clever attack. He was pushing his 
way through to wealth. But there were dozens like him; they were seekers 
of profit in the parvises of foreign banks in China. 
74e young comprador was pushed aside; he was not among the elect who 
were making fortunes in the millions. 
Chiang Kai-shek undertook the tactics of a long roundabout way. He 
decided to get to power and to wealth in a roundabout way. He returned 
to Canton. 
The anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary movements grew 
and became stronger; in 1923, in Canton, was formed the southern revolu-
tionary government. The revolution needed people who were skillful in 
military matters. Chiang Kai-shek became the Chief-of-Staff of the 
revolutionary army. In its ranks were many communists. With their 
active participation, the first academy of the revolution was created on 
the island of Wampoa. Having disguised himself, having covered himself 
with the mask of a supporter of the revolution, Chiang Kai-shek became 
the head of this academy. He used cunning and maneuvered carefully? 
hiding for the time being his ferocious hatred of the working class, of 
the working peasantry, of the democratic intelligentsia, of all the op-
pressed.

:For Chiang Kai-shek the command posts in the revolutionary army were 
only rungs in the ladder to power. 
With all the revolutionary passion, the military cadres of the Com-
munist Party were used for the armament or the people and for their mili-
tary training s it was only possible in bitter battles to conquer the armed 
counter-revolution of the northern militarists. At the head of the politi-
cal department of the WampoaAcademy was placed a leading figure of the Com-
munist Party of China, Chou En-lai. 
The Chinese anti-feudal revolution developed victoriously. In 1925 
the national revolutionary army conducted two eastern campaigns in the 
province of Kwangtung, wiping out the forces of the counter-revolutionary 
militarist Ch/en Chun-min. The communists were the soul of the campaigns, 
the bones of the revolutionary army, loyal and devoted, capable of mobil-
izing the masses for the victory over the enemies of the revolution. The 
units under the command of the communists won fame for themselves in win-
ning the victory. 
And Chiang Kai-shek? He was preparing the seizure of power. He in-
trigued against the communists and achieved their ousting from the First 
Army, which he commanded. Indeed his goal was not the victory of the 
revolution, but his own personal power. 
On 12 Marcb 1925, the most eminent leader of the Chinese revolution, 
Sun Yat-sen died in Peking. In his last political documents -- in his 
will to the Kuomintang, and in his appeal to the supreme organ of state 
power of the Soviet Union, the Central Executive Committeeo he left his 
instructions, his political legacy to strengthen the bonds with the masses, 
to intensify collaboration with the Communist Party? to make stronger 
friendship with the Soviet Union. The goal was the revolutionary over-
throw of the rule of the imperialists. 
Chiang Kai-shek betrayed these precepts. Be was opposed to one of 
the most important political directives adopted by the First Congress 
of the Kuomintang -- an alliance with the Communist Party. 
He did this not only in the interest of personal career goals. The 
interests of foreign imperialists, with whom he was connected, also im-
pelled him to do this. Indeed, starting from the events of 30 May 1925, 
the national-liberation movement in China acquired a still more profound 
anti-imperialistic character. 
On 29 May the Japanese inflicted a massacre upon the workers. On the 
next day there was held in Shanghai a vast demonstration of workers and 
students? English and American police of the international settlement 
shot the demonstrators. An outburst of indignation gripped the whole

country. In Shanghai a general strike started and continued until fall. 
The blood of the workers, shed by American-English imperialists, raised 
In the country a wide anti-imperialistic movement, which obtained the 
name "the movement of 30 May." Strikes broke out in Canton and Hong 
Kong. The working class of China stood at the head of the revolution-
ary movement. 
The foreign imperialists -- the English, American, Japanese and 
French -- became downright alarmed: against them there appeared a power-
ful opponent, whose forces were growing stronger. The imperialists intensi-
fied the activity of their henchmen -- U Pe-fu (the English) and Shen 
Tac-lun (the Japanese), resorting, through these puppets, to direct mili-
tary support of the Chinese counter-revolution. At the same time, through 
Chian Kai-shek, there were undertaken maneuvers for the purpose of push-
ing the communists out of the Kuomintang, of not permitting them to de-
velop the revolution deeply or of drawing into the revolution the wide 
masses of the people, and of converting them into leaders and the chief 
political force of the revolution. In March 1926, Chiang Kai-shek, hav-
ing declared himself "the Commander-in-Chief?g carried out the arrest of 
a number of communists. He appointed his partner on the Shanghai exchange 
Chen Go-fu as the director of the organizational department of the Kuomin-
tang. At the same time, demonstratively emphasizing this deviation from 
the most important political directive of Sun Yat-sen for an alliance 
with the communists, he appointed as rector of the Canton University the 
anti-communist "theorist" Tai Chi-toao. He was entrusted with the "theo-
retical" struggle against the three principles and the three political 
directives adopted by the Kuomintang at its First congress in 1924 as 
the program of the revolutionary movement of the Chinese people. 
A heated struggle developed between the bourgeoisie and the prole-
tariat fer the leadership of the revolution. 
The bourgeoisie gathered its forces, in order to defeat the prole-
tariat, to make a deal with foreign imperialism, to put an end to the 
revolutions and to establish their own domination. 
The proletariat gathered its forces in order to hurl back the 
bourgeoisie, to strengthen its hegemony, and to lead millions of the 
working masses of the city and the country. The proletariat won in the 
difficult, bloody struggle of many years; the proletariat conquered. 
* * * 
Chiang Kai-shek put off, for the time being, the man-to-man fight 
with the communists, with the proletariat. He was counting on achieving, 
in the alliance with them, victory against the northern militarists and 
then to stab them in the back.

In June .1926 the National-Revolutionary Army began its Northern cam-
paign. The communists again played a huge role in the arpy. They were 
in front ?.in. the line of fire, their battle units achieved the deci-
sive victories. The army of Pe-fu was defeated, the troops of Sun Chuan-
fan were defeated; the revolutionary army successfully moved to the north. 
The American and other imperialists were in a panic -- they were 
preparing the counter-revolutionary coup, were conducting secret nego-
tiations with Chiang Kai-shek, promising him a loan of 60 million dollars 
"for the struggle against the communists and for their annihilation." 
The comprador bourgeoisie accepted the order. 
In February 1927, the National-Revolutionary Army began operations 
for the occupation of Shanghai and Nanking and the expulsion of the troops 
of the corrupt generals there. Three times the workers of Shanghai re-
volted -- the third uprising began 21 March and ended with their victory. 
The henchman of the compradors bided his time. Chiang Kai-shek refused 
to come to the aid of the workers who had revolted -- it was advantageous 
for him that more blood be shed by those who had revolted, that their 
forces be rpakpned: indeed he was preparing a bloody traitorous attack 
against them. 
Nanking was occupied -- the warships of USA and England were firing 
at the city. Almost 3,000 Chinese perished. Chiang Kai-shek appealed 
to the interventioniSta-murderers with a servile message. 
12 April 1927 was the black day of the betrayal by the bourgeoisie 
of China of the cause of national liberation. On this day, Chiang Kai-
shek shot Shanghai workers, and by order of the English imperialists 
accomplished a counter-revolutionary coup. The revolution was betrayed. 
But the coup did not lead to the total victory of the counter-revolution. 
The forces of the revolutionary proletariat and the peasantry:, which 
started the agrarian revolution under the leadership of the Communist 
Party, were not broken. 
Accomplishing the betrayal, Chiang Kai-shek acted not only as an 
agent of the parasitic capital of China, which was afraid of the wide 
scope of the people's movement. He acted also as a hireling of foreign 
imperialism. Indeed, the first civil revolutionary war, betrayed by the 
Chiang Kai-shekists in 1927, was directed against foreign imperialism. 
The revolutionary war created the danger of death for foreign imperial-
ism. Chiang Kai-shek set up as his mission the placing of the Kuomin-
tang in the service of the colonizers of China. 
In the supmer of )936 in the newspaper PekingTuan-12ALLnitai, 
the Chief of Staff of the Japanese army in Northern China Colonel Nagapl 
wrote:

If at that time (that is, in 1927 - D. Zaslavskiy) the Kuomintang 
and the Communist Party had not come to a breaking-point (the Japanese 
colonel thus termed the betrayal of the Chiang Kai-shekists D. Zas-
lavskiy), then the success of the revolution would have been ensured in 
a matter of days. The influence of the imperialistic powers in China, 
and, primarily, the influence of Japan, would have been destroyed. 
Therefore the Japanese War Ministry manifested extreme anxiety and 
directed Colonel Nagami and Colonel Matsumuro to undermine the Chinese 
revolution." 
There began the period of wild, unruly terror. Chiang Kai-shek, 
who was joined by the right-wing member of the Kuomintang, Wang Chang-? 
wei, who was close to the Japanese, followed the rule: "It is better to 
execute a thousand innocent persons, than to let one guilty person escape." 
The inveterate traitors called this terror "the purge of the Kuomintang." 
The staunchest fighters of the revolution were eliminated. Not less than 
half a ion of them were executed, killed, tortured in Chiang Kai-
shekist torture chambers. 
But new fighters replaced those who had fallen. In August 1927 in 
Nanchang, units of the national army under the command of Chu Te, Chou 
En-lai?Ho Lung, Ye Tin revolted against the Kuomintang terror. In 
September, under the leadership of Mao Tse-tung there occurred the re-
volt of the peasants, miners, and soldiers in the provinces of Hunan, 
and Shansi. The Chinese Red Army was created; it subsequently became 
the great National-Liberation Army, which liberated China from the 
power of the foreign imperialists and militarists, 
And in the camp of the counter-revolution the desperate fight be-
tween the cliques of the Kuomintang was proceeding. 
The period of intensified fascism in Kuomintang China began. Pro, 
fessor Wen Bo-dai wrote, "The powerful national vanguard the Chinese 
Communist Party --? resisted Chiang Kai-shek; the violent peasant revolu-
tion resisted Chiang Kai-shek; this is the reason that the counter-
revolutionary dictatorship of Chiang Kai-sbek took the form of a feudalcomprador fascism, and the Kuomintang was converted into the Fascist 
Party, controlled by Chiang Kai-shek and the brothers Chen Id-fu and 
Chen Kuo-fu." 
But the brutal terror could not break the revolutionary movement. 
Chiang Kai-shek was seeking aid and support from the imperialistic 
powers, whose servant he was. He went to Tokyo; he was the guest of 
one of the directors of the Japanese intelligence service, Toyama 
Mitsuru. Upon taking leave of Mit suru, he gave Mitsuru an autographed 
photo with the inscription "Close, as one familyoll Thus the betrayer 
of the Chinese people became related to the Japanese intelligence 
service.

The reactionary Chinese bourgeoisie fawned upon the Japanese invaders. 
When in 1928 the Japanese organized the brutal massacre of the Chinese in 
ttinan, Chiang Kai-shek issued the order: "Not to come into conflict 
with Japanese troops.... For the sake of saving one Japanese, it is worth 
destroying even ten Chinese...." 
Among the directors of the Kuomintang there was no unity. The sup-
porters of various imperialistic groups wrangled among themselves for 
power. Chiang Kai-shek tried to subjugate his rivals by force of arms. 
tut the Japanese interventionists did not need a strong central power, 
even if reactionary, even if fascist. They prohibited Chiang Kai-shek 
from opposing other Kuomintang "governments." He was permitted only to 
declare himself as "the central government." 
In regions under control of this government, the people suffered. 
The peasants and city dwellers were ruined by taxes, and overpowered by 
the fierce orders: 
for resistance to foreign imperialists 
for dissemination of literature, which 
against feudalism -- execution; 
for the organization of meetings of an 
-- Penal servitude. 
-- execution; 
summoned to the struggle 
anti-fascist nature 
But ia the regions liberated by the Chinese Red Army, the forces of 
national liberation matured, the bases for the future victorious strug-
gle were created, the organs of national power arose. Meetings of workers!, 
peasants' and soldiers' deputies divided the lands of the landholders, 
realized the agrarian revolution. 
The foreign predatory imperialists and Chinese capitalists demanded 
reprisals against the people, against the communists. It was not neces-
sary to try to persuade the reactionary bourgeoisie; it itself hated the 
people, who were betrayed and sold by it. Fulfilling the will of his 
class, Chiang Kai-shek repeatedly flung his armies against the armed 
forces and the people of the liberated regions. His troops invariably 
were defeated. The patriotic ardor of the workers and peasants, among 
whom the communists were in the first ranks, gave rise to their victory. 
The counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie could instill into its armies 
only the spirit of plundering and profit. But the people were inspired 
by the great mission of saving their homeland from the double yoke -- of 
internal reaction, and of the foreign imperialists, the English, Japanese, 
American, and others who were standing behind the internal reaction. 
And the idea which took possession of the consciousness of the masses, 
created miracles. Almost unarmed workers and peasants defeated soldiers 
armed to the teeth of the sorry conqueror, who had buried himself. The 
liberation army was equipped with weapons of the defeated hirelings of 
imperialism.

F91117 campaigns of Chiang Kai-shek against the revolutionary workers 
and peasants failed. 
In an atmosphere of wild terror the unruly plundering proceeded. 
The bourgeoisie became rich. Military power over the people, whom it 
had betrayed, was for Chiang Kai-shek and his generals a promissory note, 
which he presented on the exchange for payment. They seized the central 
banks, subordinating all the provincial banks to them. 
These years of the unruly plunder of the national wealth were strik-
ingly described in the well-known book of Professor Chien Po-tai Four 
Families of China. Not even ten years had passed after Chiang Kai-shek's 
betrayal of the people, when all the banking business of China was in 
the power of four families -- the Chiangs (Chiang Kai-shek), the Sungs 
(Sung Tzu-weu), the 'lungs (Kung Siang-si)? the Ch'ens (Chen Kuo-fu 
and Chlen Li-fu). Each family owned one of the largest banks -- the 
Central, Chinese, Peasant, Transport. The head of all these inter-
married families, Chiang Kai-shek, became the chairman of the united 
council of all these banks, During the time of his domination in China 
"the four families" amassed, by plunder, property worth 20 billion Ameri-
can dollars. 
The violence of the reaction proceeded to the accompaniment of false 
declarations of "democracy," "reforms," of "independence," and the like, 
Having become dictator, Chiang Kai-shek remained a faithful servant of 
his class -- the great, predatory bourgeoisie. He was a comprador? who 
agreed to sell China to foreign imperialists. Without the support of 
the imperialists he mould not have existed even one day. 
Surrounded by gangsters, enraptured with police power, corrupted 
by flattery, Chiang Kai-shek thought that he was actually omnipotent, 
that China belonged to him. But louder and louder was heard the threat-
ening rumbling of the powerful revolutionary movement which brought 
liberation from the compradors and their protectors. 
* * * 
Without declaring war upon China, the Japanese imperialists in 1931 
proceeded to direct conquest by armed force. The imperialists of the 
USA and England supported and encouraged them. Indeed, trampling the 
fields of China with an armored boot, the Japanese advanced in the direc 
tion of the Soviet Union. The comprador bourgeoisie of China, having 
accomplished the immediate betrayal of its people, not only did not 
oppose the Japanese aggression, but in essence shut its eyes to it. 
The comprador bourgeoisie was more afraid of the Chinese people than of 
the imperialistic aggression. It willingly assumed the task to fight 
against the Soviet Union.

In August 1931, Chiang Kai-shek deelared,, within the tight circle 
of his accomplices: "If China will be conquered by the imperialiets? we 
shall be able to exist even as colonial slaves, if only to save our own 
skin." 
When, in a month, the Japanese began their provocation in Mukden, 
he gave the orderg "In case of provocations on the part of the Japanese, 
caution must be manifested and in every way possible a clash must be 
avoided." 
The Japanese aggression caused an angry rebuff on the part of the 
Chinese people. The 19th Army heroically defended Shanghai. In the 
whole country the national-liberation movement surged high. Into the 
struggle were attracted the peasantry and the progressive circles of the 
bourgeois ihtelligentsia. Even the feudal lords of the northern prov-
inces, fearing for their existence, under the influence of the peoples 
national movement tried to stem the advance of the Japanese armies. 
There was universal indignation against the Japanese colonizers 
and their Chinese agents. News about the bloody violence caused by the 
aggressors disturbed the workers. Conditions were created for the forma-
tion of a united national front against the imperialists. The internal 
contradictions within the Kuomintang became aggravated. The middle and 
petty bourgeoisie were for active military resistance against imperial-
istic Japan. 
But it was this national enthusiasm which most of all frightened 
Chiang Kai-shek and his supporters from the upper bourgeoisie. They 
were expecting aid from without. 
The comprador bourgeoisie discovered its complete political bank-
ruptcy. Chiang Kai-shek signed the capitulatory armistice with the 
Japanese, offering them freedom of operations in the country. Depending 
upon the assistance of the imperialists Chiang Kai-shek rose in oppo-
sition against the Chinese Red Army. This was a punitive expedition 
against the peasants, who were fighting for the land and for the inde-
pendence of the fatherland. The headquarters of Chiang Kai-shek in 
Hankow gave the order g *Shoot one and all of the total adult male popu-
lation...of the people s-revolutionary regions. Burn all the buildings 
in these regions.. It is necessary to cut with a sharp sword, without 
any mercy." 
In words, Chiang Kai-shek had to appear as an enemy of imperialist 
Japan. In reality, Chiang Kai-shek was Japans secret agent. His whole 
capitulatory policy encouraged the aggressors to further armed penetra-
tion into China. This was also furthered by the imperialistic 'policy 
of "pacifications" of international fascism which the English, American 
and French imperialists were pursuing against the aggressive *anti-
Comintern" bloc, against "the axis" of Berlin-Rome-Tokyo.

The country was threatened with a deadly danger -- complete enslave-
ment by imperialistic Japan. On 17 January 1933 Mao Tse-tung and Chu Te 
proposed the program of a joint anti-Japanese war: 1. The immediate 
cessation of the offensive of the Kuomintang troops against the liberated 
regions of China. 2. The guarantee to the people of democratic rights. 
3. The immediate arming of the people, the creation of a voluntary army 
for the defense of China and the guarantee of independence, unity, and 
territorial integrity of the country. 
This was an act of high patriotism on the part of the Commtuaist 
Party, for which the interests of the people were foremost. How did the 
reactionary Chinese bourgeoisie answer this appeal? On its behalf Chiang 
Kai-shek declared: "The trouble for our country comes not from the Japan-
ese, but from the gangsters from Shensi." Thus did this king of the compra-
dors call the honest Chinese patriots, the peoplega-revolutionary forces, 
headed by the Communist Party. 
On 31 May 1933 the Chiang Kai-shekist capitulators signed the shame-
ful agreement in Tangu. The government of Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Ching-
wei recognized the seizure by Japan of Manchuria and the province of 
Jehol, and the establishment of its "influence" in Northern China. It 
became clear to all the Chinese people, that the bourgeoisie was giving 
up the struggle for the independence of China, and was sacrificing the 
people to the imperialistic plans of war against the Soviet Union. 
By October, Chiang Kai-shek was preparing his fifth campaign. The 
plans of this campaign were worked out by the Hitlerites, whose head was 
General Von Seikt. Against the Chinese Red Army were flung 700,000 
Kuomintang soldiers. 
On 2 October, Chiang Kai-shek gave a speech in which he set forth 
his program. "Whether our country exists or does not exist," he declared, 
"depends completely upon the Japanese...." 
The American imperialists helped the compradors. On the eve of the 
campaign they gave Chiang Kai-shek a large loan. 
The Communist Party did not cease the struggle for the organization 
of the all-national rebuff of the Japanese. Having shifted the bases of 
the forces of the national liberation to the border region of 8hansi-
Hensi4Tingsia4, the Central Committee of the Communist Party proposed,, 
in 19359 a program of a united resistance against the Japanese invaders. 
Throughout the whole country there was growing and becoming stronger the 
will for resistance against the invaders. The workers g movement was ex-
panding.

In August 1935 the Central Committee of the Communist Party. of China 
appealed, in an open letter, to the Central Executive Committee of the 
Kuomintang to form a united National anti-Japanese front, and to create 
the united democratic Chinese republic, in which would be included the 
revolutionary bases of the border region. The Kuomintang voted down 
this proposal, thus signing the death sentence for itself. 
The disintegration among the feudal-comprador bourgeoisie began. 
In December.1.936 the Kuomintang generals Chang Hsueh-liang, and Yang 
Hu-cheng arrested Chiang Kai-shek in Sian. He tried to save himself by 
flight -- he ran from his bedroom in his underwear and sought shelter 
in an out-of-the-way place in a ditch, and was discovered by soldiers. 
The Communist Party pursued a policy of conciliation, striving to restore 
unity of all the revolutionary and opposition forces, unity of the anti-
Japanese front. Chiang Kai-shek pledged to press against the aggressors. 
But true to the nature of the speculator-comprador? he, of course, again 
deceived. 
On 7 July 1934, Japanese imperialism began the realization of its 
plan for the seizure of all of China. In September, after long pro-
crastinations, the Kuomintang adopted the proposal of the Communist 
Party concerning the creation of a united National front for the strug-
gle against Japanese imperialism. In reality this did not mean a ces-
sation of the capitulatory policy of Chiang Kai-shek. At the end of 
1938 he carried out, through the German ambassador in China:, Troutmann, 
negotiations for peace with Japan on the basis of complete capitulation. 
The armies of Kuomintang, headed by the capitulators and defeatists, 
could not put up effective resistance against the invaders. Almost with-
out battles the invaders seized Peking, Wuhan, Nanking Shanghai. Only 
near the border region was the wave of the Japanese invasion stopped, 
only in battles with the Chinese patriots, with the Red Army did the 
invaders suffer defeats. 
The Chinese reaction had to shift its bases. Chiang Kai-shek fled 
to Chungking. Here he did nothing, and watched the Japanese imperialists 
establish their power in China. They, pillaging the Chinese people, care-
fully protected the personal property of Chiang Kai-shek and flatteringly 
exalted his "wisdom." One of the fiercest Japanese invaders, General 
Hata, as a sign of special respect, performed religious rituals at the 
grave of Chian & Kai-shekls ancestors. 
And Chiang Kai-shek was biding his time until he would be able to 
openly make a deal with the Japanese imperialists. He did not carry on 
war, and did not even declare war against Japan. It had become impossible 
to hide the fact that the upper comprador bourgeoisie of China was not 
capable of heading the struggle for independence. The economic ruin in

industry and in agriculture became the source of state weakness. In these 
conditions that were tragic for the people, Chiang Kai?shek was engaged 
in personal enrichment. "The four families" used his stay in Chunsin in 
order to appropriate almost all the lands around this city. 
The bourgeoisie did nothing in the remote rear; the people continued 
the heroic struggle. Leading the union of workers, peasants and intelli?
gentsia in the border region, the Communist Party was able to convert this 
part of the Chinese territory into a stronghold, inaccessible for the 
Japanese. 
The agrarian reform in the border region and in other partisan regions, 
the wise democratic policy of the Communist Party created a strong rear 
area and provided national unity. This was the source of the strength and 
invincibility of the 8th and 4th Armies, created on the base of the Red 
Army of China. They not only repelled all the attempts of the Japanese 
offensive, but also proceeded to counter?attack. The victories of these 
armies strengthened their popularity and caused love for them in the whole 
country. The Chinese people saw with their own eyes that there were forces 
in the country capable of resisting the foreign invaders. The authority 
of the Communist Party increased; the influence of the Chiang Kai?shek 
clique, which had become bankrupt and demoralized, fell more sharply. 
The people were rising for the heroic struggle against the invaders. 
It was not until December 1941 that Chiang Kai?shek declared war 
upon Japan. 
The Chinese people demanded from "the central government" decisive 
offensive operations. Conditions were favorable for this. The Communist 
Party again and again renewed its proposals to stop the civil war, to 
unite the military forces and to concentrate them into the liberation 
war against Japan. 
Chiang Kai?shek gave false, hypocritical promises, agreed, for the 
sake of appearances, to negotiations, to the unification of military 
forces under a joint command, to the formation, under the Kuomintang, 
of a national?political council with the participation of the Communist 
Party. But all these were maneuvers and ruses of the old businessman of 
the stock exchange. At heart, he believed in the supremacy and in the 
victory of the German?Japanese military bloc. 
In this dishonorable, anti?national, traitorous game he was sup?
ported by representatives of American monopolies. Despising the Chinese 
people, they hated the communists and first of all thought that China 
was in the power of American imperialism. Patrick Hurley -- the official 
representative of the USA -- appeared in the country first of all as an 
agent of Rockefeller, of his powerful monopoly, the Standard Oil Company.

General Cheneult commanded American aviation in China. He was up 
to hie ears in work for the creation of the air transport monopoly, which, 
according to his plans was also to seize all export and import operations 
in China, to engage in the buying up of goods and lands. 
Dozens of other American businessmen, large and small, priced, aimed 
at the resources of China, counting on plundering China. 
* 
Making a fortune on American supplies, Chiang Kai-shek did not wage 
war, and did not want to wage war against Japan. He was striving for 
agreement with her. Mao Tse-tung wrote in 1943 that Chiang Kai-shek 
feared the victory of the Allies, "because with the failure of all three 
fascist sovereign states, into the entire world would come a great era of 
liberation which had never occurred in the history of mankind; and the 
Kuomintang fascist dictatorship of the compradors and the feudal lords 
would become a tiny, isolated little island in the unbounded world ocean 
of 'redo m and democracy.? (Mao Tse-tung, Selected Works, vol 4, Foreign 
Literature Publishing House Moscow, 1953, p. 254.) 
The American protectors and friends of Chiang Kai-shek, in particular 
that deputy of Wall Street, Hurley, adopted his plans of reprisal against 
the organizers of the resistance against the Japanese aggression and en-
couraged him in every way. 
On the Chinese-Japanese front, Chiang Kai-shek only rattled his 
weapons, and treacherously sent his main forces against the liberated 
regions of China. 
Here he appeared as a real ally of the Japanese, who had started 
"the general offensive" in the winter of 1941-1942 against the liberated 
regions of China. 
Chiang Kai-shek assisted in this campaign: he secretly induced his 
generals to go over to the Japanese for this purpose. 
The decisive victories of Soviet arms, of the Soviet people on the 
fronts of the Great Patriotic War caused a new enthusiasm, a new influx 
of the forces ot national liberation. In January 1944 the front of the 
liberated regions of China, headed by the Communist Party, proceeded to 
counter-attack and hurl back the Japanese invaders. Chiang Kai-shek, 
treacherously carrying on secret negotiations with the Japanese, intensi-
fied the persecution of the Communist Party. He insolently demanded its 
breaking upl

In 1941 Chiang Kai-shekls book The Fortunes of China came out. In 
it was revealed the program of fascism of China. Chiang Kai-shek boast-
fully promised in this book "to destroy communism" during a two year 
period in China. However the days of his regime were already numbered. 
The ground was definitively cut from under the feet of the reactionary, 
traitorous feudal-comprador bourgeoisie. In the Kuomintang itself began 
the strongest vascillations; wide circles in all strata of the population 
began to unite around the only force capable of liberating China from 
foreign dependence, around the National-Liberation Army, around the Com-
munist Party. Creatively using the experience of the Soviet people, of 
the Soviet Armed Forces, of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the 
Chinese communists successfully consolidated the alliance of the working 
class and the peasantry, attracting into this union all social groups 
interested in the freedom and independence of the Chinese people. 
In the fire of the Patriotic War a united, powerful National front 
was created and strengthened. 
Only the compradors, who had gone mad with hatred of the people and 
with craving for profit, did not see this and did not want to see this. 
The American imperialists, just as greedy, as well as dazzled by the 
myth of their unlimited power over the world, did not see this and did 
not want to see this. 
Hitler's Germany was defeated. The definitive victory over German 
fascism and Japanese militarism was drawing near. Counting on usurping 
the fruits of victory, the American imperialists in China were letting 
themselves go. Their deputy in Kuomintang China, Hurley, already con-
sidered himself an all-powerful satrap. The war with the Japanese was 
forgotten. More and more new campaigns were prepared against those 
regions which, in the heroic struggle, had been liberated from Japanese 
occupation. But in the battles with the peoplels-liberation armies, 
with partisans, the bands of the Kuomintang invariably were defeated. 
The armament and equipment which flowed from USA, went to the people, 
to the splendid troops, led by Mao Tse-tung and Chu Tee The forces of 
the people quickly increased. The armies of the comprador bourgeoisie 
were dwindling. 
In July 1945, Mao Tse-tung warned the American imperialists "If 
the policy of Hurley continues, the American government will wallow hope-
lessly in the deep and stinking cesspool of Chinese reaction, and will 
place itself in hostile relations with the multi-million masses of the 
Chinese people, who have already been awakened, and who are waking up, 
before our eyes...." (Mao Tse-tung, Selected Works, vol 4? 1953, pp 
6?6-607.)

Thus it turned out. The American imperialists have no one to blame 
but themselves. In their anti-national game they had placed their cards 
on Chiang Kai-shek. They shared the fate of this corrupt speculator. 
The outcome was not long in coming. 
* * * 
After the defeat and capitulation of Hitler Germany the traitorous 
Kuomintang policy of dragging out the war with Japan was doomed to failure. 
Whereas the Chiang Kai-shek armies marked time, the 8th People's Libera-
tion Army proceeded to decisive attack. 
In August 1945 the Soviet Army attacked in Manchuria the notorious 
Japanese Quantun army. The armed forces of Japan in China were defeated. 
Not even one month passed, when Japan capitulated. 
The whole Chinese people enthusiastically welcomed the friendly 
Soviet Army. The Chinese people had been liberated from the Japanese 
invaders. The governments of the USSR, USA, and England solemnly recog-
nized its independence. The Chinese sovereign state was one of the five 
great powers, which had been summoned to guarantee the peace and inde-
pendence of nations. 
Chiang Kai-shek with difficulty concealed his anger, his fear of 
the liberated Chinese people. 
His clique at first seized the political fruits of the victory of 
the Chinese people. The representatives of the reactionary Kuomintang 
appeared at international conferences and at the United Nations Organi-
zation. But they represented not a living, growing, democratic China, 
which had gone through the rigorous political school in the war and in 
the revolution, but the old feudal-comprador system, which had completely 
spent itself, incapable of independent existence, supported only by for-
eign imperialism. 
But this comedy did not continue for long. Immediately after the 
capitulation of Japan, the people of China saw that they had been de-
ceived. The American invaders had replaced the Japanese invaders. In 
1946 the Chinese-American trade treaty gave up all of China to the power 
of the capitalist monopolies of USA. The great Chinese people had not 
taken up arms in order to replace one group of invaders and foreign 
robbers by another group of invaders and foreign robbers. A boundless 
anger seized all the honest patriots of China. 
As always, Chiang Kai-shek was false to the homeland and betrayed 
her. Panning the conditions of his agreement with American imperial-
ists, he hurled his troops, American military equiptent against the

Peoples-Liberation Army, against those regions where democratic power 
had been established and extensive social reforms had been carried out, 
where for the first time the great people-toilers during their entire 
centuries-old history could breathe freely and straighten their backs. 
The American imperialists despised the Chinese people so much, 
that they did not consider it necessary to mask their predatory plans 
in respect to China. Nelson, the representative of the US War Produc-
tion Administration) in a burst of cynical frankness, declared that 
"business circles of the USA should consider China as the industrial 
outskirts of the United States, which has not less, if not more impor-
tance, than the American West, as it was at the beginning of the 20th 
century on 
The orgy of pillaging -- of unruly, venturesome, unrestrained 
pillaging -- began immediately. The American businessmen who had 
appeared suddenly in China were seizing everything that they could 
-- enterprises, railroads, mines, lands. Also The Four Families," 
headed by Chiang Kai-shek participated in this pillaging. 
About 70 percent of all the national wealth of China -- in indus-
try, in agriculture -- turned out to be the property of Chiang Kai-shek, 
of "the Four Families." 
The advocates of this band -- politicians and journalists -- chat-
tered about the reconstruction and development of the economy of China. 
But restoration was out of the question. The break-down of the economy 
became intensified. Inflation absorbed almost the entire earnings of 
the workers. Taxes took away the remainder of the earnings. The coun-
try was rolling towards an economic catastrophe. Protests were heard 
even in the most moderate circles of the Chinese bourgeoisie, whose 
rule of American monopolies was threatened by destruction and death. 
In July 1947 even the American almmffAlkozolza had to admit that 
the Kuomintang was not a political party, but "a joint-stock company, 
ruling the country." It wrote about Chiang Kai-shek and his partners: 
"Some people, inasmuch as they themselves thus are making a fortune, 
would prefer the downfall of their country, rather than share with 
others the right to govern it." 
But the times when the great Chinese people were lielpless against 
unrestrained colonialism had irrevocably passed. The Chinese people 
had already become sovereign master of a significant part of the terri-
tory of China. The people irrevocably had set out on the way to na-
tional independence. Nothing could stop its victorious movement.

Incited by the American imperialists, Chiang Kai-shek sent his armed 
bands against the revolutionary army of the Chinese people. The American 
generals worked out the strategic plans. The American commissaries sup-
plied the Kuomintang riff-raff with the newest armament. American instruc-
tors taught Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers. American aircraft sheltered them 
in the campaign to the north. 
But the rotten stuff remained rotten stuff. The hordes of Chiang 
Kai-shek did not endure the thrusts of the Peopleas-Liberation Army. 
Supported by all the people, the army went, in 1947, from the defensive 
over to the offensive. 
In vain did the American military clique try to prop up the Chiang 
Kai-shek armies, sending him their armed forces to help him. The counter-
revolutionary armies dwindled with every day. And the People's-Liberation 
Army irrepressibly increased and victoriously advanced. Mukden was liber-
ated, in the battle near Suchow the main armed forces of the reaction were 
defeated. The and of the Kuomintang clique of traitors and robbers of 
the Chinese people was approaching. 
In January 1949 the Communist Party of China asked the Kuomintang 
to begin negotiations on the conditions for the democratization of China 
and its complete independence. This offer was not accepted. 
The Peoples-Liberation Army, victorious, moved to the south. 
Tientsin and Peking were liberated. In April 1949-the troops of the 
Peoples-Liberation Army, joyously welcomed by the people, entered Nan-
king. This was the end for the whole comprador-bourgeoisie, for Chiang 
Kai-shek. He fled to Taiwan under the protection of American battle-
ships. ' 
In September there was organized the central government of independ-
ent, sovereign China. On 1 October 1949, the Peopleas Republic was pro-
claimed. The event of the greatest universal-historical significance had 
occurred. 
In wrath, in helpless anger, the American imperialists had to leave 
the free land of the great peoples China. 
The illusions of American imperialism were scattered in ashes, its 
plans had failed. But anger and craving for revenge blurred the minds 
of the imperialists of the USA and blinded them. They did not want to 
recognize the great change in the life of the Chinese people. They were 
still living in wild fantasies. Their definitive defeat would be all the 
more crushing.

The class which had given birth to and reared Chiang Kai-shek, the 
'class? which he had served -- the upper, feudal-comprador bourgeoisie 
-- was liquidated. Developing, China destroyed the remains of feudalism 
and bourgeois parasitism. The Chinese people, having formed a united 
National Front, was closely united around its democratic government, 
around the Chinese Communist Party. 
Having adopted the Constitution, the people planned the program 
for the building of socialism in their own country. 
Of the upper Chinese bourgeoisie there remained only fragments. 
But the American imperialists preserved Chiang Kai-shek in the 
Taiwan jar. They still needed this puppet. 
With his help they were preparing a new attack on the people of 
China. Having concluded "an agreement" with them in December 1954, they 
occupied indigenous Chinese territory -- the island of Taiwan, having 
thus carried out an act of direct aggression against the Peoplets China. 
For these purposes the American imperialists maintain Chiang Kai-shek, 
the traitor and betrayer, surrounded by contempt of the Chinese people, 
turned away and exiled by the Chinese people. 
His life was the shameful life of the last comprador of China. 
* * * 
The new socialist system in China has become strong. The vast 
plans for the development of heavy industry have been successfully car-
ried out. The blockade of China by the imperialists was futile. The 
threats on the part of the USA were unavailing, were peremptory shouts 
directed at all who dared to trade with the Chinese people and to recog-
nize the People's Republic of China as a sovereign power. It is im-
possible to isolate the Chinese people. They have loyal and powerful 
friends. The powerful Soviet state fraternally and unselfishly renders 
aid to them. The countries of the peoples democracies and some capi-
talistic states have entered into economic and cultural relations with 
China. 
The victory of the Chinese people reformed all Asia and Africa. The 
attempts of the imperialists to destroy the republic of Vietnam failed. 
Burma and Cambodia were liberated from imperialistic dependence. The 
policy of friendship of free nations was formulated in the historic con-
ditions of the Bandung Conference. Morocco and Tunis broke away from 
the grappling imperialistic clutches. The onslaught of the armed aggres-
sion of England, France and Israel was repulsed by independent Egypt.

The government of the Peoplets Republic of China offered the Chinese 
white emigrants from Taiwan to peacefully complete the last page of their 
hopeless resistance against the victorious revolution. This appeal had 
certain consequences: the alarmed Vice-President of USA, Nixon, quickly 
rushed to Taiwan, and the President of the USA sent Chiang Kai-shek a 
personal letter, in order to give hope to the white Chinese emigration, 
to maintain among the white Chinese emigration a faith in Chiang Kai-shek, 
and faith in the effective aid on the part of the American militarists. 
But the hatred of the Chinese people for imperialists and their agents 
was stronger than the American promises. This hatred, in spite of the 
brutal terror, literally a volcanic lava, burst open on Taiwan. The revolt 
in Taipei in the summer of 1957 indicated that the earth was burning under 
Chiang Kai-shekls feet even in his last refuge; under the protection of 
American bayonets. 
Implacable time does its part. Chiang Kai-shek became older, his 
army was growing decrepit. The comprador class was liquidated forever. 
The Chinese bourgeoisie had no future. But the young Peoples Republic 
of China was flourishing. New cities and villages were growing. The peas-
ant cooperatives together with the boundaries which divide the individual 
plots of land, destroy all that remains of the former poverty, darkness, 
lawlessness. The hatred of the new China for all forms of colonialism, 
and, consequently, Chiang Kai-shek was boundless. His name became a sym-
bol of national humiliation and disgrace. What if he is still physically 
living! Politically he is dead, this last comprador of China. 
Puppet of American Monopolies Do Zaslavskiy 
The Korean bourgeois agents of the USA demand war. They brandish 
their American arms. Syngman Rhee (Li Syn Man) shouts the loudest of 
all. In the personality of this old agent of American imperialism are 
reflected the most repulsive aspects of colonialism. The story about 
his life is the story of how an American gangster became a ruler -- even 
if only a nominal ruler -- of a significant part of the Korean peninsula. 
To become acquainted with the career of Syngman Rhee means clearly to 
imagine the shameful way of the puppet of the American colonizers. 
...Speaking on 28 July 1954 before the Congress of the USA in Wash-
ington, and appealing for immediate war against the Soviet Union, the 
Peoplegs Republic of China and the Korean PeoplOs-Democratic Republic, 
Li Syn Man cynically declared: "By law and birth I am a Korean. But 
in spirit I am an Americanou Hardly anybody will dispute this murderous 
idea of his personality (as reflected by his own words). Syngman Rhee 
never had anything in common with the Korean people. His life is the 
story of the betrayal of the homeland, of dirty intrigues, and of aid 
in conducting the bloody policy of American and Japanese imperialism in 
Korea.

By the beginning of the 20th century Japan asserted itself as the 
chief imperialistic oppressor of Korea. 
But for the Japanese imperialists this was very little. Japan 
coveted all of China. The American imperialists also were fixing their 
greedy eyes upon China. They did not take their eyes off Korea, surrep-
titiously supporting their agents, who were intriguing against the 
Japanese, among "the nationalistic" bourgeoisie. But they were doing 
this not for the sake of liberating the Korean people, of delivering 
them from the foreign yoke. But they were doing this in order that the 
yoke of Japanese rule could be replaced by the yoke of American imperi-
alism. This struggle of the American and Japanese monopolies was ex-
pressed within Korea in the fight between their henchmen and agents, in 
the struggle not of two parties, but of two cliques: the dollarophiles 
and yenophiles. 
The Korean people, who were defending their country with fortitude 
against foreign invasion, had to carry on the struggle on two fronts 
-- against the foreign invaders and against their servants and agents 
among the Korean bourgeoisie, who had sold itself to the invaders. 
The people of Korea selflessly fought for their state independence. 
The dollarphiles? hurled back by their competitors in the underground 
and beyond the boundary of Korea, did not so much oppose the Japanese 
imperialists, as they oppose the revolutionary, truly liberation move-
ment of the workers, peasants and part of the national bourgeoisie, 
ruined by Japanese capital. 
From this environment of the dollarophiles came Syngman Rhee -- the 
descendant of the Korean dynasty which had ruled Korea from 1486 through 
1910. His parents little thought of instilling in him Korean culture, 
the national traditions of their country. From childhood they sent their 
son to the American missionary school in Seoul which engaged in the train-
ing of cadres of American agents from the Korean bourgeoisie and feudal 
lords. The missionaries did not work without any purpose -- by age 22 
Syngman Rhee was converted to the Christian faith. 
Syngman Rhee began his political activity of betrayal for the ad-
vantage of Japan. Being, at a comparatively early age, a member of the 
secret council during the reign of the Korean Emperor, he actively col-
laborated with the pro-Japanese elements. He was accused of state 
treason. In 1898 Syngman Rhee was sentenced by a Korean court to penal 
servitude for life. And only as a result of the intercession of the 
Japanese envoy was the life sentence replaced by several years of prison. 
Hiving stayed in prison the prescribed term, Syngman Rhee Went to 
America in 1904. Here he went through the higher school of service for 
the lAtereete Of US imperialism.-

When his training was completed, he took an examination in loyalty 
to American capital. Syngman Rhee returned to Korea in 1911 as an Ameri-
can emissary, invested with much confidence. He represented the cele-
brated YMCA (Association of Christian Youth). This organization, espe-
cially in countries of Asia and the East, often was used as a screen by 
intelligence organs of USA, which recruited agents in these countries. 
At the same time he was the missionary of the Methodist Church. 
Thus the young dollarophile was converted into an ordinary agent 
of the American intelligence service. In his heart there was not the 
slightest inclination for the struggle for national independence of his 
country. He was not bound to the Korean people by anything. There was 
nothing national in Syngman Rhee. The American cosmopolitanism corroded, 
exterminated all patriotic feelings in him. He was educated as a rene-
gade. He did become a renegade. 
Korea, at this time already occupied by the Japanese, had been con-
verted into a province of the Japanese Empire. At that time it was diffi-
cult and even dangerous to carry on work for the benefit of American 
interests in Korea. And Syngman Rhee went to the Hawaiian Islands. He 
organized "The Korean" Methodist Church there and the Korean Christian 
Institute." The mission, which stood before Syngman Rhee, was the very 
same mission -- to recruit, from among the Koreans, people devoted to the 
interests of the American monopolies. 
* * * 
The first world war was over. The people of Korea, tortured by 
Japanese rule for many years, robbed by Japanese imperialism, were long-
ing to be liberated from foreign invaders. The living example of the 
Great October Socialist Revolution -- the light of peace, freedom and 
happiness for all peoples -- inspired the Korean people. The strike 
movement of the young Korean proletariat was growing, the Korean peas-
ant was rising, the partisan movement against the invaders was expanding. 
The attempts of the Korean bourgeoisie and landholders to direct 
this movement into the channel of peaceful conciliation were futile. 
In March 1919, throughout the whole country, revolts broke out in which 
two million Koreans participated. 
The bourgeoisie, the landholders were striving to frustrate, dis-
organize this powerful movement. For this purpose there was created, 
in April 1919 in Shanghai, a provisional emigrant "government." By the 
efforts of the American agents among the circles of this "government" 
Syngman Rhee was declared "president" of "the Provisional Korean Repub-
lic." And although by 1924 every kind of connection of this emigrant 
clique with Korea had ceased, he called himself "the president" of the 
non-existent republic right up to 1941.

This "president" appeared at Versailles, when, at the peace confer-
ence which was taking place there, the division of imperialistic spoils 
was proceeding. He came not in order to protect the interests of the 
Korean people, the honor of his homeland, robbed and desecrated by the 
Japanese invaders. No. Taking advantage of his old acquaintance with 
US President Wilson, Syngman Rhee came with a memorandum, in which he 
tried to sell Korea wholesale to American imperialism, to establish 
nothing less than "a trusteeship" of the USA over Korea. This sugges-
tion, inspired by the American intelligence service, was given publicity 
and caused "sympathetic interest" in American circles at the Versailles 
Conference. But at that time Japan was among the conquerors, and not 
the conquered. It was necessary to reject this project for American 
trusteeship over Korea. 
Syngman Rhee disappeared from the scene for a long time, almost 
for a quarter of a century. The American intelligence service was hold-
ing him in reserve. He, for the time being, was not needed, neither as 
"president," nor even as a Korean politician. He was needed only as an 
agent and a spy. 
Having forgotten about the country of which he had called himself 
the president, Syngman Rhee was arranging his commercial deals. Striv-
ing to take root in American soil, he adopted American citizenship. 
Connections with Korea and even with the Korean emigration in China 
were broken. The former "president" was entering into shady affairs. 
He was often seen among "lobbyists," businessmen, who, being active in 
the lobbies of the American Congress, do business in politics, act as 
go-betweens, give bribes, receive political and other contracts. 
World War II broke out. Japanese armed forces attacked Pearl Harbor. 
The picture of international relations sharply changed. The problem of 
Korea appeared in a different light. In the plans of American imperial-
ism it was destined to become only a link, a stage of the process of sei-
zure of the entire Pacific Ocean basin -- Japan, China, Indo-China, the 
islands. 
Syngman Rhee acted in accordance with this plan of American imperi-
alism. He joined in the anti-Soviet campaign. As far back as 1943 Syngman 
Rhee appeared in Washington with message" from the so-called provisional 
Korean government (which was cooped up at that time in Chungking in the 
train of the Kuomintang, and under the protection of the well-known Kuo-
mintang henchman Kim Ku). In this "message" he slandered the Soviet Union, 
asserting, that the USSR was striving for "expansion in the Far East." 
On the pages of the American press Syngman Rhee carried on a bitter cam-
paign against the USSR.

The war in the Far East was being dragged out. The USA was not rush-
ing to finish it. Almost not participating until June 1944 in the large-
scale military operations in Europe, the American war machine, in spite 
of its evident material supremacy over the Japanese army, got tied up in 
separate operations in the Pacific Ocean islands, suffering serious de-
feats from the Japanese at times. 
Among those who wanted the quickest cessation of the war, the entrance 
of the Soviet Union against imperialistic Japan caused gladness -- the 
liberation of the peoples of Asia from Japanese imperialistic oppression 
was approaching. But for Syngman Rhee this great historic act of the 
Soviet Union caused an attack of rage and fear -- indeed prospects arose 
for the real liberation of the Korean people from the yoke of foreign 
imperialism. 
The enemy of the independence of Korea, the enemy of the Korean peo-
ple, Syngman Rhee, not understanding and not wanting to understand the 
historic changes which had occurred during the last decade, blindly obeyed 
his American bosses. All Korea, according to Syngman Rhee, had to be con-
verted into an American province, into a colony of the USA. For him the 
role of salesman of American monopolies was sufficient. 
The Soviet armed forces, having defeated the Quantung army, put an 
end to the power of Japan in Korea. And when the American military clique, 
together with the capitalist plunderers, rushed into South Korea, it found 
the real boss there -- the Korean people, who had fought for complete state 
independence of their country. 
* * * 
The national-liberation movement of the Korean people started in the 
period of the Japanese occupation. It obtained the most powerful stimulus, 
the strong organization; it was formed in 1925, when the Communist Party 
of Korea arose, when in stubborn, heroic partisan battles, the battle-
hardened cadres of selfless fighters pushed forward and were trained. 
The brutal terror of the Japanese invaders and their servants did not 
break the people's movement. It was based upon revolutionary workers and 
peasants; in addition there was the new Korean intelligentsia, there were 
representatives of the petty and middle Korean bourgeoisie, pushed into 
the ranks of the national-liberation movement by the colonizer, by the 
predatory policy of the Japanese militarists. The people's movement, led 
by the communists, was inspired and enriched by the experience of the 
Great October Socialist Revolution, of the building of Communism in the 
Soviet nation, by the experience of the struggle and victories of the 
Red Army of China.

During the five years from 1931 through 1936, in the so-called Korean 
governorship of Japan (the Japanese thus named Korea, which they had cap-
tured) there were registered 23,928 battles between Korean partisans and 
Japanese troops. In these battles participated about 1,370,000 Korean 
patriots-partisans. 
The whole population of Northern Korea joyously welcomed the coming 
of the Soviet Army. In revolutionary passion the people drove out the 
servants of the Japanese imperialists, the betrayers of the Korean people 
-- usurers, landholders, corrupt officials. These betrayers of the people 
were seeking refuge in the south of Korea, beyond the 38th parallel, under 
the protection of American bayonets. In the north the people took power 
into their own hands. 
But in South Korea also power began to go into the hands of the peo-
ple's committees. The demand for independence here was universal. The 
American powers became the obstacle to the satisfaction of these just de-
mands. Having appeared in South Korea, the American military clique did 
not intend to hand over the government of the country to its people. 
In South Korea were created mass people's parties and democratic 
organizations. In their program they brought forward the demand for the 
national and state independence of Korea, democratic reforms and reorgani-
zations. 
The American occupation powers in South Korea, carrying out the im-
perialistic plans of US monopolies, drove away the people's committees, 
unleashed the activity of the reactionary bourgeois organizations. The 
armed bands of terrorists created by these organizations killed Korean 
patriots who were fighting for the freedom and the independence of Korea. 
They established in the country a regime of ferocious reactionary dicta-
torship, which was based upon American bayonets. The Communist (subse-
quently the Labor) Party of Korea, the staunch protector of the interests 
of the people, of national and state independence of the country, was 
prohibited. Mass democratic organizations were submitted to unprecedented 
persecution. 
The policy of the regime of the dictatorship, created by the bands 
of terrorists, for the conversion of South Korea into a military colony 
of American imperialism of Wall Street could not, of course, be carried 
out without being supported by its accomplices, the executioners of the 
Korean people. This regime needed accomplices in order to keep the 
Korean people in subjection, to prepare the attack upon the people's 
forces in North Korea. For this purpose the old betrayer of his people, 
the American agent Syngman Rhee proved useful.

While, on the battlefields against the Japanese invaders in Manchuria 
and in the mountains of Korea, in the partisan battles, there were being 
decided the fortunes of the Korean people, Syngman Rhee was trading with 
America in the natural resources of Korea. The newspaper Korean Inde-
pendence wrote 7 November 1945, that Syngman Rhee had agreed in advance 
to provide the American monopolies, in particular the Oriental Consoli-
dated Mining firm, with mining concessions in North Korea. In exchange 
for this the American firm offered him a million dollars. The newspaper 
said that Syngman Rhee promised also to guarantee American rights in the 
mining industry provided that he be made head of the Korean government. 
In accordance with this understanding, a certain Samuel Dolber was desig-
nated beforehand as advisor for mining affairs in Korea. 
* * * 
Syngman Ehee was taken out of the military-intelligence organs of 
the USA and the State Department at the end of 1945. In an American air-
plane, he was sent to Tokyo, and from there to Seoul. He went directly 
from the Mrport in Tokyo to General MacArthur for instructions. The 
first steps of Syngman Rhee on Korean land, in which he had not set foot 
for 35 years -- half of his entire life -- indicated the character of 
these instructions. 
Syngman Rhee declared to a correspondent of the American army news-
paper Stars and Stripes in Tokyo: "In Korea there are now 71 parties. 
Outside of two, all of these parties are communist or communistically 
inclined." He assured the correspondent of his intention to fight against 
these parties. 
After his arrival in Korea, and at the Very first meeting in Seoul 
on 17 October 1945, he maliciously slandered the Soviet military forces 
in North Korea. Of courses Indeed these powers permitted the free 
activity of all democratic organizations of the Korean people who had 
been liberated by the Soviet Army. For Syngman Rhee, the dealer in 
matters of his own homeland, this was not to his taste. 
The newspaper Korean Independence wrote: "The political philosophy 
of Syngman Rhee is a dictatorship covered by a shield of democracy.' 
He slandered and destroyed both 9communists, as well as all those who 
were an obstacle in his way." 
Korean progressive organizations immediately recognized this scout 
of American reaction. In the spring of 1946 they made serious accusa-
tions against him. Exposing his dealings with American mining indus-
trialists, they pointed out, that Syngman Rhee had incited them to 
violence against their enemies during his stay abroad, had carried on 
anti-Soviet agitation in USA and had fanned the flames of the civil 
war in Korea.

The war against the Korean people and their democratic organizations 
became the main business of the Korean comprador bourgeoisie and "the 
Korean American" Syngman Rhee. At first he tried to act directly. He 
obtained recognition of "the emigrant government" in Chungking. When 
this venture failed, his American protectors fabricated the so-called 
"constituent assembly" of representatives of reactionary cliques 
-- "democratic" and national," with the participation of several small 
reactionary groups. This "assembly," which represented a handful of 
inveterate businessmen, even declared itself "the parliament of the 
provisional government" and announced the creation of "the higher polit-
ical council," of the so-called "democratic chamber of peoples repre-
sentatives of Southern Korea." For some time this self-styled organ 
acted as an advisor in the American military administraDion. But the 
people of Korea boycotted it, refused to recognize it, and the American 
military powers had to dissolve it. 
American headquarters in Korea had the task of uniting the Korean 
reactionary bourgeoisie, of subordinating it to the American command, 
of making a stable stronghold of the predatory colonizer policy. 
Syngman Rhee was given this task: create a party of a reactionary 
"type." There was fabricated "the National Association of Independence," 
headed by Syngman Rhee. This was not a party, this was a "junta" or, 
simply, a gang. Into this gang, together with former policemen who had 
served the Japanese, came American gangsters of Korean descent, who had 
flown to Korea together with Syngman Rhee and made up his entourage. 
Demand gives rise to supply. In eager rivalry, dozens of inveterate 
executioners of the Korean people offered their services to the American 
headquArters in Korea. Other bourgeois gangs, which appeared under the 
signs of various "parties," vied and competed with the clique of Syngman 
Rhee. They had played the master in Korea under the Japanese, or had 
come from Kuomintang China. They were all striving for power as a means 
of enrichment and did not want to recognize Syngman Rhee as their leader. 
In these conditions any pretense at "democracy" was impossible. The 
road to fascist dictatorship was cleared by fierce terror, by the mass 
destruction of the democratic elements. In South Korea the orgy of mur-
ders, torture, general plundering did not stop. Cruel violences of the 
colonial type came down upon the population of South Korea. The people 
responded to this by uniting into democratic organizations, into the 
Democratic National Front, by an intensified struggle of the partisan 
forces of the Korean people. 
Creating "support" for his power, Syngman Rhee mercilessly made 
short work of his rivals, the leaders of the bourgeois cliques. He used 
extensively the methods of the American criminal world. The competitors 
of Syngman Rhee, the same type of gangster as he himself, were eliminated 
by murders; they disappeared without leaving a trace; they sought refuge 
in flight.

As the right-hand man and high-executioner until Li Syn Man there 
functioned a certain Li Bum Suk. This 54-year-old leader of *youth" 
fascist terrorist organizations lived all his life in emigration, and 
conversed with Koreans in English through interpreters. Many Korean 
patriots perished from his hands. The other handymen of Li Syn Man 
were no better: the bribe-taker and the American agent Li Si Yen, the 
landlord of houses of prostitution Sin Hen U3 and many other criminal 
elements. These were the types who were torturing, robbing and oppres-
sing the people of Southern Korea1 
The American invaders tried in vain to maintain "the prestige" of 
Syngman Rhee, having proclaimed South Korea a republic in June 1948, 
and having fabricate il "the election" of Syngman Rhee as its "president." 
In answer to this, the Korean people created partisan detachments, which 
with weapons in hand fought against the American henchmen. 
South Korea was a sad picture of universal devastation. Unemploy-
ment was wide-scale. The peasants were ruined and were starving. The 
landholders with impunity made short work of the poor and the farmhands. 
Industry was parallzed. 
A crowd of American plunderers swooped down upon South Korea. In 
the first ranks were agents, confidential agents, the largest monopolies 
of USA. There had formerly operated in Korea a Japanese colonial monopoly, 
which was named The Eastern Colonization Society. Later it was renamed 
New Korea. Under this mask, much land as well as mining and other enter-
prises of South Korea became the property of American monopolies. The 
Morgans and Rockefellers became its real bosses. In their hands was con-
centrated more than 60 percent of South Korean industry. 
The American military clique and the bureaucracy were also making 
a fortune in Korea. MacArthur became infinitely rich. John Foster 
Dulles, at that time adviser to the US State Department, operated in 
South Korea as a big businessman from the International Nickel Company. 
Before the beginning of the war in Korea, this company received, in the 
third quarter of 1949, 5 million dollars profit. In the third quarter 
of 1951 its profits soared to 16 million. 
South Korea was being generally robbed, both wholesale and retail. 
There were exported from the country raw materials and produce, the 
production of the mining industry, and ancient monuments of culture. 
The Korean bourgeoisie did not lag behind its foreign bosses. Hav-
ing taken shelter in a palace, afraid of his own people, not trusting 
even his retinue, Syngman Rhee was feverishly buying, selling, specu-
lating, robbing. In a short period of time he became a fantastically 
rich man. Nothing seemed reliable to him in Southern Korea, other than 
American bayonets. And the richer the robbers and plunderers became, 
the greater was their fear of the people, the more violent their hatred 
of North Korea.

The people's power was growing and becoming stronger, the young 
Korean People's-Democratic Republic, created by the people of all of 
Korea, including South Korea, was flourishing. 
The people's power of the young republic applied the law of land 
reform, which allotted land to the landless peasants, laws about labor, 
the equality of women, the nationalization of enterprises owned by the 
Japanese colonizers and betrayers of the Korean people. The broad, 
real sovereignty of the people changed the appearance of the country. 
The people became the master of their own fate, their own lives, their 
own happiness. The patriotic organizations of the entire Korean people 
created the union of Korean patriots -- the United Democratic Home 
Front. It developed an extensive program of peaceful unification of 
Korea by means of merging the Supreme People's Assembly of the Korean 
People's Democratic Republic and the National Assembly of South Korea; 
and for the development of a single constitution and for the conducting 
of democratic elections throughout the whole country. Upon the peti-
tion of the Supreme People's Assembly, directed to the USA and USSR, 
the Soviet Union withdrew its troops from North Korea. The US govern-
ment did not even reply to this petition. It is true that later the 
US government announced the withdrawal of its troops from South Korea. 
But this announcement did not correspond to reality -- there remained 
there many American troops, there remained military missions, American 
bases. 
Exposing itself in the eyes of the people by its anti-national 
policy, as agents of American imperialism, the South Korean bourgeoisie, 
headed by Syngman Rhee and his clique were inevitably proceeding to 
failure. They saw salvation from the failure only in war against the 
Korean People's Democratic Republic. 
In January 1948 Syngman Rhee boastfully announced to the repre-
sentatives of the press that South Korea could mobilize a half-million 
man army for the campaign to the North. He assured the correspondents, 
that the arms for this purpose would be presented by the United States. 
According to the decree of the monopolies of USA he repeated over 
and over again, high and low, that American troops had to remain in 
South Korea. On 11 March 1949 he declared that the immediate task was 
the armament and training of the troops of South Korea. For what? 
For the aggressive armed campaign against the Korean People's Demo-
cratic Republic. 
The preparation of the military campaign expanded. In May 1950 
Syngman Rhee told a correspondent of the United Press that he would be 
able "to unite" North and South Korea by military force, and that for 
this purpose he would need only "insignificant military support."

Syngman Rhee was impatient. He urged on, hurried his American bosses 
to start the war sooner, sooner. On 10 June 1949 he declared that South 
Korean troops could occupy all Northern Korea nif circumstances would re-
quire this." 
On 30 October 1949, speaking on board an American warship in the 
port of Chemulpo, he made an appeal for "the unification of Urea by 
means of military force." Two months later he shouted that nthe time had 
come to begin the intensified preparation for the unification of Korea 
by force." Rhee lied: the intensified preparation had been carried out 
a long time ago by himself and his bosses from the Pentagon. 
In February 1950 Syngman Rhee conferred with General MacArthur; the 
perspectives of military operations against the Korean Peoplels Democratic 
Republic were discussed. He demanded that military operations be begun 
in the Spring of 1950. And Korea was in the fire. Rhee was satisfied, 
he rubbed his hands. American planes were waging war in the sky, Korean 
villages were burning.... And the old betrayer was happy: soon he would 
be "president" of all Korea. 
But the illusions perished.... The very old gangster calculated 
everything: how many tanks and planes, rifles and machine guns would be 
necessary in order to make short work of the young republic, to trample 
it in blood. He did not take into consideration one thing -- the real 
force of the Korean people, headed by the Labor Party, of people, who 
for the first time had become acquainted with the joy of freedom and na-
tional independence, From the south advanced the slaves of foreign capi-
tal, deceived, disappointed, hating their commanders; they had been driven 
together into an army. Workers and peasants of North Korea, inspired by 
the high idea of the independence of their own fatherland, came to the 
battlefield for the defense of their democratic achievements. 
The betrayers of the homeland, the traitors came from one direction; 
the revolutionary patriots came from the other direction. 
* * * 
Korea, young and full of strength, repulsed the attack. 
Syngman Rhee had bragged that he would be in Pyongyang three days 
after the beginning of military operations. He blindly believed in Ameri-
can generals and instructors. But not even three days had passed after 
the treacherous attack, when the Rhee riff-raff crumbled under the first 
thrusts of Korean patriots.

Life had indicated that Korea belonged to the Korean people, and not 
to the American colonizers and their miserable agents. This had become 
clear in those days even to the American adventurers. Syngman Rhee did 
not justify their hopes. The Korean bourgeoisie discovered their com-
plete weakness. 
The American imperialists did not want to become reconciled to their 
defeat. The American air force, the navy, and the army were flung into 
battle. 
But the sacred cause of the people was invincible. The people were 
defending their homeland, its state independence and national independ-
ence. The Korean people, with the fraternal aid of national China, frus-
trated the plans of the Washington conquerors, defended their honor, free-
dom, and independence. The Pentagon changed its commanders in vain. Vic-
tory did not come. 
But Syngnan Rhee came off unhurt. His bosses could not part with 
him. In his name they committed violences against Korean and Chinese war 
prisoners. In hie name the conditions of the truce Were violated* He 
was the mouthpiece of the most reactionary, most adventurist circles of 
Washington. 
According to their assignment, he agitated for the creation in the 
Pacific area of an aggressive military group headed by the United States. 
As far back as in the spring of 1949 he had declared that the USA should 
assume the leadership of such a group, and that it would be necessary to 
convene a special conference for the creation of the Pacific Ocean pact, 
like the Atlantic pact. In August 1949 he conferred with Chiang Kai-shek 
about plans for the creation of such a group. In December 1950 he fought 
for the creation of this same alliance in an interview with the well-
known organ of American reaction -- the magazine United States News and 
World Report; in November 1953 he went to Taipei to Chiang Kai-shek. 
They published joint statements in which they appealed for the creation 
of a "united anti-communist front in Asia." 
The military operations in Korea stopped. This could not be pre-
vented by the howls of Syngman Rhee, who had made an appeal for a cam-
paign to the Yalu River; and had demanded the use of atomic weapons 
against China. American weapons, American military doctrine, American 
policy suffered defeat in Korea. But the American imperialists did not 
want to admit it* The reactionary circles appealed for a resumption of 
the war, and Rhee responded to these appeals by attacks of war hysteria. 
He again talked about a campaign to the North. He called upon American 
congressmen to go to war against the Soviet Union, the People's Republic 
of China, the Korean People's Democratic Republic.

"Rhee declared"..."Rhee does not recognize"..."Rhee threatens".... 
The pages of the American militant press were covered with such headlines. 
But Syngman Rhee had no prospects, just as the pawns in a hopelessly 
lost chess game have no prospects. The movement of the peoples of Asia 
toward their complete and definitive liberation from the imperialists-
colonizers was powerful and invincible. This movement inevitably swept 
out of its way not only the henchmen of American imperialism, but also 
their agents and servants. 
* * * 
Out of the most extensive part of the globe, which for many years 
had been the field of innumerable colonial wars, the source of unprece-
dented enrichment for the colonizers, the new Asia, the Asia of a great 
free people, was converted into a powerful stronghold of peace and friend-
ship of peoples. The powerful Chinese power was proceeding along the way 
of socialist development. India appeared as a resolute supporter of 
peace. Burma, Cambodia refused to participate in military blocs. The 
peoplels Vietnam threw off the chains of colonial oppression and actively 
took a stand for peace. The Bandung Confederation proclaimed the princi-
ples of the new relations among countries, based upon peace and mutual 
respect. There was an increase in the number of supporters of peace in 
Japan and in other countries of Asia, which had not as yet completely 
liberated themselves from the power of the colonizers. The striving of 
the peoples of the Arab world for an independent policy and against war 
is becoming more and more apparent. Boldly and resolutely, independent 
Egypt fought against colonialism, having withstood the onslaught of the 
military aggression of Fingland? France, and Israel, having repulsed the 
attempts of American monopolists to subject the freedom-loving Egyptian 
people to their own dictate. The peoples of the former colonies are 
invincible in this powerful movement towards freedom, towards a worthy 
life. And this movement will be stopped neither by the American coloni-
zers, nor by their agents and henchmen, Syngman Rhees or Chiang Kai-sheks.

with a pack of cards in one hand, a statuette of a naked woman in the

in the center of the city under the satisfied hum of people of Saigon.

Standing at the window, Ngo Dinh Diem tensely listened attentively 
to the noise of the crowd. His shameless face did not express any anxi-
ety. As always, his black shiny hair was irreproachably sleek, the 
pressed suit deftly clothed his fat figure. The victory over Bao Dai 
pleasantly tickled his ambition: the family of Ngo Dinh Diem had no 
less right to the ancient throne of the emperors of Annam, than did 
the family of Bao Dai. 
On this warm October evening of 1955 he was declared the president 
of the republic of Vietnam -- the head of South Vietnam, But the new 
president, more than anybody else, understood the price of such a "will" 
of the people. And as he listened to the noiselamong the curses that 
were poured upon the head of the former emperor, he was afraid that he 
would hear curses, directed against him -- Ngo Dinh Diem, 
There, beyond the grating of the palace, the people were making 
noise, the people, whom he, an aristocrat from the Ngo family, never 
had understood and had always hated, that very same Vietnamese people, 
who already firmly held in their hands the power in a large part of 
the country, to the north of the 17th parallel.

wrote then about Ngo Dinh Diem: "He does not know the masses, does not 
trust them and does not know how to use them." 
The French newspaper Le Monde said, through the side of its mouth: 
"This cold, reserved and indecisive person, this bourgeois, proper, 
pompous and lonely, far from the people, cannot evoke the enthusiasm of 
the crowd. He does not use the people's support; he is practically un-
known to the population as a whole." "Without American support," the 
newspaper added, "his authority will be limited to his palace, if he 
is not driven out from there." 
? "American support" -- these words immediately came to his mind, 
when the president began to sort out the reasons for his coming to 
power, for which he had been craving so much and had been waiting so 
long. He deserved it, this American support.

Ngo Dinh Diem was born in 1901 into the family of a mandarin of 
the first class. Three centuries before, when the colonizers had come 
to Indo-China, his ancestors had considered it advantageous for them-
selves to adopt Christianity. Since then they faithfully served the 
colonizers, holding high posts at the court of the Annam emperors. The 
servant of two lords proved his worth in a very singular way in the 
father of Diem, the old Kha. This devout Christian was an overseer 
of the imperial harem.

Ngo Dinh Diem was educated in the imperial palace "half-way between 
the heavenly paradise and the earth of humble people," in an environment 
of luxury, admiration for the emperor, contempt for the people. However, 
the stern Kha sometimes sent Diem to shell rice, so that the son might 
thus find out about the life of peasants. But even this did not invoke 
in the mandarin's son a respect for the people and for their hard work. 
The French journalist Lucien Bodar wrote about Ngo Dinh Diem that, as a 
child, he had become a Pharisee. Ngo Dinh Diem remained for all his 
life a hypocritical, sanctimonious person and bigot. 
On the doors of the presidential office appeared the inscription 
"Women are not permitted to enter." He did not miss the chance to empha-
size his own piety. "God is his first advisor," declared Bodar. "When 
serious and urgent problems arise, Ngo Dinh Diem withdraws to his own 
room. This is a cell with an iron bed, a crucifix, prayer books and 
little benches for prayer. He prays a long time on his knees, meditates, 
supplicates." 
With all his piety Ngo Dinh Diem as a young man refused to take the 
cloth of the Catholic priest; he did not go, after the example of other 
representatives of his class, to study in Paris, but graduated from the 
civil administration school in Hanoi. In these decisions of the young 
Diem there was hidden a fine, far-sighted calculation: even at that 
time he did not want to be too closely connected with Catholics, of 
which there were few in Vietnam, nor with the French. 
Like his father and older brother, Diem became an official in the 
service of the French. His career was assured. At 20 years of age he 
was already chief of a region. Having curried favor with the colonizers, 
Diem, with characteristic insiduousness and brutality, made short work 
of the participants of the movement for national liberation. In his 
region he smashed the revolutionary organizations of the New Vietnam 
Party and The League of Revolutionary Youth of Vietnam -- the predecessor 
of the Communist Party of Indo-China. Having held the post of the gov-
ernor of Nin-Tuan province, Diem resolutely and brutally made short work 
of the fighters for freedom. On his black conscience are hundreds of 
tortured revolutionaries. 
The hangman's services of Ngo Dinh Diem were highly valued by his 
bosses. At the beginning of 1933 he became Minister of Internal Affairs 
of the imperial government. 
The unrestrained ambition and the unrestrained striving for power 
made Diem clash with another colonial puppet -- Fam Quen, Careerist 
Diem was defeated by his more successful rival and had to retire. Diem 
was nursing a grudge. He could wait.

It seemed that in 1940 luck smiled at Diem again. Indo-China was 
occupied by Japanese troops. While the people rose up with weapons in 
their hands against the invaders, while the patriots were fighting in 
the jungles for the freedom and the independence of their country, Ngo 
Dinh Diem together with his older brother Ngo Dinh Ehoe organized a spy 
system for the Japanese invaders. According to the evidence of the news-
paper Nvan Zan, in the archives of the Japanese intelligence service Diem 
was noted as a capable agent: it was he who cleverly stole important 
French documents and gave them to the Japanese. 
But disappointment was awaiting Diem. Whether because the Japanese 
considered him an insufficiently important figure, or because they doubted 
the loyalty of the betrayer who had so easily changed bosses, the post of 
the puppet prime minister was obtained by Tran Tron Kum, rival and competi-
tor of Ngo Dinh Diem. Diem had to be satisfied with an insignificant offi-
cial post. But even in this post he did not lose time to no purpose, hav-
ing been able to get rich through risky speculations. 
At the end of the second world war, Ngo Dinh Diem came into the field 
of vision of the American intelligence service. This was the time when 
the colonial system of imperialism in the whole world was cracking at all 
its seams. Casting off from their shoulders the yoke of century-old slav-
ery, the peoples of Asia carried on the struggle not only against the 
Japanese invaders, but also for the liquidation of every colonial yoke, 
for banishment of both the colonizers and their puppets. 
Diem decided that his hour had come. Rather, the American intelli-
gence service, which had chosen Diem among other betrayers of the Viet-
namese people, decided this for him. The personal qualities of Diem 
played their role: cruelty, insiduousness, slyness, unscrupulousness, 
in the achievement of a goal, love of power, vanity, bigotry. A biog-
raphy was created for him. The servant of the French colonizers and the 
Japanese invaders was declared a fanatic nationalist, a fighter against 
invaders and colonialism. For the betrayer and speculator was created 
the halo of an incorruptible, irreproachably honest man; on this glutton 
(those, who had observed him, wrote about the pathological craving of 
Diem for food) was placed a wreath of asceticism and chastity. 
"He is a sincere, honest and selfless man," thus Ngo Dinh Diem was 
boosted by General Collins, chief of the special American mission in 
Southern Vietnam, "he is a really selfless and capable man, who seeks 
nothing for himself, but only for the Vietnamese people. He is a real 
nationalist. He believes in the freedom of Vietnam and stubbornly 
fights for this freedom, never vascillating. He did not compromise 
with the Japanese, refused to compromise with Ho Chi Min. He never 
concluded a compromise with the French."

This through and through false character dated back, nevertheless, 
to 1955, when Ngo Dinh Diem had become Prime Minister of South Vietnam. 
And at that time, after the end of the second world war, he was still 
trying to flirt with the French, until he was definitively convinced of 
a quick failure of the French colonial system in Indo-China. The son of 
the mandarin of the first class was frightened to death by the scope of 
the national-liberation movement. Ngo Dinh Diem saw the only real force 
capable of suppressing the people, who had revolted and whom he hated, 
in American imperialism, which was armed for the colonial possessions 
of its 'tallies." And Diem went into the service of the Americans. 
* * * 
The leaders of American policy did not rush to put Ngo Dinh Diem 
into the big game, whose purpose was the replacement of the French 
colonial influence in Indo-China by American domination. The connec-
tions of Diem with the French colonizers and Japanese invaders were 
still too memorable. Precisely for these criminal connections Diem was 
arrested by the powers of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, but soon 
afterwards, as a result of the policy of indulgence pursued by the gov-
ernment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, he was set free. 
When in 1949 the former Emperor Bao Dai became president of "the 
independent" republic of South Vietnam, Ngo Dinh Diem disappeared from 
the political horizon. A trace of him appeared in the United States. 
The State Department of the USA and the Archbishop of New York, Cardinal 
Spellman, were training Ngo Dinh Diem for two years for the role des-
tined for him -- chief of the South Vietnam state. The training took 
place near New York, within the walls of a seminary for Catholic priests. 
The French weekly Tribune de Nation wrote thus about the connections 
of Ngo Dinh Diem with Spellman: "Their relations were so close, that in 
the opinion of some, the Cardinal became in a literal sense the director 
of the matter of who should become the Prime Minister...." The young 
Jesuit priest Dulles often visited Diem and had long conversations with 
him. Yes, yes, the son of the present US Secretary of State and nephew 
of the director of the American Intelligence Service, Allen Dulles. The 
close connections of the betrayer of the Vietnamese people with the 
State Department and American intelligence service were established at 
the highest level." 
When in 1953 Dulles held the post of Secretary of State, he tried 
to conceal these obvious connections. Ngo Dinh Diem was sent to Belgium. 
There, in an ancient Benedictine monastery, he with feverish attention 
watched the events which were irresistibly developing in Vietnam and in 
near-by France. The colonial war was turning out obviously not to the 
advantage of the French imperialists. The French people, the whole world

community resolutely demanded the cessation of "the dirty war." The 
battle of Dien Bien Phu was marked as the failure of the French colonial 
system in Indo-China. 
In May 1954, shortly before the Geneva negotiations on Indo-China, 
under direct pressure of the USA, Bao Dai appointed the American hench-
man Ngo Dinh Diem Prime Minister of South Vietnam. Nominally all the 
power was put into Diem's hands. "The chief of state" Bao Dai in fact 
left the affairs of state, "was resting" on the Cote dtAzur. "The 
power, which Ngo Dinh Diem achieved during this period," wrote the maga-
zine Foreign Affairs and Reports, published in Delhi, "was not so much 
the result of his personal qualities and powerful will, as the result 
of the support which he was able to obtain from the powerful illy -- the 
United States. The United States considered Mr. Ngo Dinh Diem as their 
man...." 
The French magazine Esprit called Ngo Dinh Diem "the favorite candi-
date of the United States" at that time when the United States "most 
resolutely was making up its mind to deprive France of control over Indo-
China." 
Diem went to Saigon accompanied by the priest) appointed by Cardinal 
Spellman to look after him, and Colonel Landsdale of the American Secret 
Service. The latter is known under the name of "trainer of presidents" 
-- it was as a result of his efforts that Ramon Magsaysay had come to 
power in the Philippines. 
"He came," noted the French magazine Nouveau FeMina_et France-
Illustration, "in an environment of general indifference. Only several 
hundred priests, nuns and village notables met him. The people did not 
know him, and his name itself was not known to the masses." 
Diem locked himself up in the former residence of the governor-
general, which had been renamed The Palace of Independence, shut him-
self off from the population by bayonets and machine guns. "His 
Palace of Independence," added the magazine, "very strongly resembled 
a prison or a beseiged fortress."

During the night of 20-21 July 1954 in Geneva were signed the agree-
ments concerning the cessation of military activities in Vietnam, Laos, 
and Cambodia. The bloody war which had lasted for eight years was fin-
ished. The Deputy Minister of National Defense of the Democratic Republic 
of Vietnam, Ta Kulang Butu signed the first of these agreements in the 
name of the Commander-in-Chief of the People's Army of Vietnam; General 
Delotais signed in the name of the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces

of the French Union in Indo-China. The signature of the representative 
of South Vietnam was not under the agreement, nor under the conclusive 
declaration of the Geneva Conference. Also the representative of the 
USA Bedell Smith refused to join the declaration; he stood at the final 
stage of the conference in "brilliant isolation." Washington had ma-
tured the far-going plans for the frustration of the Geneva agreements. 
The Geneva Conference marked the defeat of the policy "from the 
position of strength" and the triumph of the idea of peaceful coexist-
ence of states with different social-political systems, the achievement 
among them of agreement by means of negotiations on all unsolved ques-
tions. The Geneva Conference indicated the growing force of the national-
liberation movement in the whole world, the increase of authority of the 
Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the Democratic Republic of 
Vietnam, which had steadily fought for the cessation of the "dirty war," 
for the establishment of peace in Indo-China. 
The Geneva agreement on Vietnam established the provisional demo-
cratic line approximately along the 17th parallel, which "cannot be 
construed as being to any extent the political and territorial boundary." 
Along both sides of the demarcation line it was proposed to regroup the 
troops, to remove from North Vietnam the French armed forces. It was 
forbidden to introduce new troops, to import foreign armament and mili-
tary personnel, to create foreign military bases. The Indo-Chinese 
states were committed not to participate in military alliances. Of 
great significance was the decision concerning the conducting in Vietnam, 
during July 1956, of universal free elections, the bases for national 
reunion of Vietnam under conditions of peace. 
As the following events indicated, Ngo Dinh Diem did not intend to 
fulfill even one of these conditions. In this he enjoyed the full sup. 
port of the United States, which was striving to perpetuate the schism 
of Vietnam, to force France out of South Vietnam, and to convert it into 
an American colony. Five months after Geneva, the American magazine 
United State p New and World Report with unconcealed complacency wroteg 
"The United States -- instead of France -- has assumed the chief responsi-
bility for the policy in respect to Indo-China. The higher political 
decisions, which until now had been made in Paris or by the French com-
mand in Indo-China, from now on will be made by the United States and 
their new special envoy in Saigon, General Lawton Collins.? 
However the realization of the American plans was inhibited by the 
confusion in South Vietnam during the first months after the conclusion 
of the Geneva agreements. The American magazine New Republic character-
ized in the following manner the situation in the country, which the 
USA was intending to make its colony: ?In non-communist South Vietnam 
chaos rules. The country is divided; the struggle is proceeding, in 
-374-

which participate civilians, generals and rival private armies; the situa-
tion threateningly resembles China in the last days of Chiang Kai-shek. 
In all its complexity, the situation is almost like a musical comedy." 
The English newspaper Observer completely corroborated this estimate 
of the situation: "During the four months after the signing of the Geneva 
agreement the Prime Minister was on bad terms with almost all the politi-
cal and military forces in the country, in which almost complete anarchy 
reigned." 
The army revolted against the government. It refused to carry out 
its orders, and at night conducted anti-governmental radio broadcasts. 
The leaders of the feudal sects Cao-Dai and Hao-Habs, who governed in 
extensive provinces and who had their own private armies, arose against 
Ngo Dinh Diem. The sect Bin-Hsulen, which controlled the police service 
of Saigon, considered Ngo Dinh Diem its sworn enemy. Surrounded by oppo-
nents, the government controlled almost nothing besides its own ministe-
rial buildings. 
It is interesting that the government created by Ngo Dinh Diem not 
long before the Geneva agreement, consisted of his closest relatives al-
most exclusively. Diem himself held the posts of Prime Minister, Min-
ister of Defense and the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces (subse-
quently, after he had become President, he reserved for himself the 
indicated posts). His younger brother, Ngo Dinh Nu, was "political 
advisor" with very wide rights of interference in the affairs of the 
ministries, in particular, the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Diem's 
second brother, Ngo Dinh Ilylen, was Ambassador to France. The elder 
brother, Ngo Dinh Tuk, concentrated in his hands the control of the 
church. Ngo Dinh Kan, one more of Diem's brothers) and also his older 
sister controlled the most important branches of the economy. A number 
of key positions in the government and the administration were held by 
close relatives of Diem -- the Tran family. 
In the conditions of the bitter struggle for power of the South 
Vietnamese feudal groups and generals, Washington definitively counted 
on Ngo Dinh Diem. 
Senate/. Mansfield, who had made 
report to the Senate Foreign Affairs 
himself for support of Ngo Dinh Diem 
replacement of the American henchman 
a trip to South Vietnam, in his 
Committee, resolutely declared 
and against any possibility of the 
for the post of Prime Minister. 
17 November President Eisenhower sent to Saigon his special repre-
sentative Lawton Collins to render aid to the government of Ngo Dinh 
Diem. "Thus," noted the American magazine Pacific Affairs, "it was 
clearly given to be understood that Ngo Dinh Diem, just as formerly, 
in spite of P11 his obvious defects -- was an American henchman."

The magazine added, that the government of Diem "acquired an un?
pleasant reputation of 'American puppet,' which hardly contributed to 
its popularity in Asia." 
In Saigon Collins declared: "I came to Vietnam in order to render 
possible aid to the government of Ngo Dinh Diem and only to his govern?
President Eisenhower, in order to increase "the authority" of Diem, 
appealed to him with a special message, promising extensive aid. 
And the betrayer of the people zealously fought for the fulfillment 
of the instructions of his American bosses, preparing to throw the coun?
try at the feet of the United States. With exceptional cruelty and in?
siduousness he made short work of all who stood in his way to power. 
He was "ready for the establishment of his rule...to go to any 
means: bribery in respect to the corrupt, lies -- in respect to de?
ceives, goodness itself -- in respect to the naive and vain," wrote 
the French magazine Nouveau Feminaet France?Illustration and added that 
Diem "had secured for himself victory by insiduousness, the sword, and 
fire." 
"The authority of Diem was supported by blood..." declared the 
weekly Bulletin de Paris. Even Diem's bosses were startled by the 
methods by which he operated. "One American critic," wrote the maga?
zine United States News and World Re ort, "called him oa little monster, 
created by us'." 
In the very first skirmish of the "little monster" with his rivals, 
American support played the decisive role. The question concerns the 
clash of Ngo Dinh Diem with the adherent of Bao Dail the chief of the 
General Staff of the South Vietnam Army Nguyen Van Xuan. This was that 
very same General Xuan who publicly bragged that it would be enough for 
him to just remove the telephone receiver, and in five minutes a detach?
ment of tanks would penetrate into the palace and would drive out Ngo 
Dinh Diem. The General did not exaggerate too much: the 260,000?man 
army had vowed "perpetual fidelity" to him, and the palace of the Prime 
Minister, allegedly, was guarded by a handful of soldiers armed with 
obsolete rifles and fire?hoses for the dispersal of people's demonstra?
tions. 
Nevertheless Diem won the victory. Bao Dai in France had received 
an order from overseas, and Nguyen Van Xuan was removed from his post. 
"The Americans demanded that Bao Dai disavow this soldier who was too 
well known. Ignonomously he flew on a plane to France," wrote the maga?
zine Nouveau Feminaetikance-Illustration. "Since then," added the 
English Observer, "the figures on the chess board jump up as a result, 
obviously, of some strong blows of the Americans upon the table."

Xuan left, but there remained the army with its generals, ready to 
occupy Diem's place. It was decided to reorganize the army. The Ameri-
cans were engaged in the reorganization. The chief advisor of Ego Dinh 
Diem on military questions the American General OlDaniel justified his 
nickname of "iron broom." He removed from the army all the generals 
and higher officers who were hostile to Diem. At the same time French 
influence in the army was done away with. 
However, at first) these plans of the Americans were given a hos-
tile reception by the leaders of the army. In the beginning of May 
1955 Bao Dai transferred the command of the army into the hands of Gen-
eral Nguyen Van Vi. The General, who was dreaming of power did not 
reckon on the craft and insiduousness of Diem. The latter bribed other 
generals, who envied Vi, and once, when Vi thought that he was already 
near power, he had a narrow escape from his subordinates, who rushed 
at him with knives. 
Using the opposition among the sects, Ngo Dinh Diem succeeded in 
putting an end to the private armies of the sects in turn, when their 
leaders refused to enter the "national" army which had been reorganized 
by the Americans. 
By the beginning of 1956 the armies of the sects, weakened by pro-
longed bloody conflicts, did not represent a force which threatened the 
power of Ngo Dinh Diem. 
For the methods of reprisal of Diem with his rivals, the story of 
General Trin Min Te is characteristic. This general was of the Cao-
dai sect, one of those generals, with whose help Diem had put an end 
to General Vi. Diem and Te were considered close friends. Insiduous-
ness and cruelty, the striving for the achievement of the goal without 
considering the methods, brought them close together. The magazine 
cited above,Nouveau Yenta et, France-Illustration gave, not without a 
certain admiration, the following portrait of General Te z "He was a 
little, silent, and very handsome young man with delicate, pure facial 
features. But for him the highest realization of purety and beauty 
was death, bloodshed, execution." When the power of this bloody sa-
dist over the army appeared threatening to Diem, a bullet from a cara-
bine of American origin put an end to life. Diem arranged a solemn 
funeral for him angl, allegedly "fainted away" near the grave of his 
"friend." "But the murderer was never found," added the French maga-
zine) "even if it is assumed that a search was made for him." 
When, on the whole, an end was put to the enemies of Diem inside 
the country, then came the turn of the former Emperor Bao Dai. In 
October 1955, as a result of a falsified "plebiscite,* Ngo Dinh Diem 
became the head of the state -- through the kindness of the US State 
Department -- the President of South Vietnam.

South Vietnam.... Rich and at the same time poor country, flooded 
with blood, torn away from the North, where the people rule, by the whim 
of Washington. The United States needed a bridgehead for attack upon 
the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, for maintaining constant tension in 
this little corner of the globe. They found this bridgehead in South 
Vietnam, headed by the puppet President Ngo Dinh Diem. The strings) 
which make him move, are in the hands of dozens of important American 
advisors. Hundreds of petty officials from numerous missions of the 
USA filled the entire country. 
Not much is known about the activity of the Americans in their 
South Vietnamese colony -- the work of censorship and the police system 
was set up in model fashion. But the scandalous facts of the bossing 
of the Americans in South Vietnam nevertheless penetrated into the for?
eign press. The Indian newspaper Blitz in correspondence from Saigon 
under the headline "Yankees at the Court of Diem, or Diem at the Court 
of the Yankees?" wrote: "The Americans in Cochin China behave just as 
if they were in Oklahoma or South Carolina -- and they even feel more 
free here.... It is true, that Ambassador Reinhardt...comes to his 
audience with the President without his dogs. Reinhardt 'observes1 
the rules of diplomatic etiquette: he does not summon Ngo Dinh Diem 
to his embassy to inform him of the new instructions from Washington, 
but transmits them through a courier. 
"However the rank and file members of the numerous American mis?
sions in South Vietnam are not hampered by the observation of diplo?
matic conventions: they behaved just the same way as the Hitler 
gauleiters in occupied territories in the period of the flourishing 
of the Nazi regime." 
The Indian newspaper cited a series of scandalous outrages of 
"such Americans." "But the incident, when five Icivilized' officers 
of the US raped a 12?year?old girl under the eyes of her mother and 
then shot her," indicated Blitz, "is the most sickening of the great 
number of similar incidents." And here is what happened in a small 
Vietnamese village. When the inhabitants of the village tried to 
demand the punishment of the guilty Americans, the inhabitants of the 
village were punished in a manner typical for occupation troops: by 
order of a US officer, South Vietnamese troops committed the whole 
village to flames. 
Diem, who hated his own people, was ready to destroy hundreds 
of thousands of his own countrymen, if only to serve those who had 
placed him in the presidential chair. 
But worse than Diem's hatred of his own people was his fear of 
them. Diem knew: it is possible to put an end to dozens of his ene?
mies, it is possible cruelly to make short work of hundreds and

thousands of true patriots, but it is impossible to kill the people; it 
is possible to bribe a dozen and a hundred corrupt officials, it is 
impossible to bribe the people. And all the same in the evenings the 
President anxiously listened to the noise of the large city of Saigon, 
on whose streets the police patrols were walking, and the American offi-
cers were making merry. 
Only fear of his own people can explain Ngo Dinh Diem's refusal to 
conduct the election ordered by the Geneva agreement. Diem was afraid 
of the people of Saigon, Shalon, Gue, of the cities and villages of 
South Vietnam. And in reality, what, other than misfortune, did Diem's 
government bring the people? 
It was already obvious to all now, that the American alluring pro-
grams for the restoration of the economy of South Vietnam completely 
failed. The economic aid, which constituted not more than one-tenth 
of the military aid which the USA rendered South Vietnam, did not permit 
the development of the economy, which had been destroyed. The foreign 
trade deficit reached tremendous dimensions. The country was flooded 
with huge masses of paper money. The only thing which the Americans 
succeeded in doing was the creation in the country of "order," based 
upon soldiers' sub-machine guns and police shadowing. 
From the population of South Vietnam it was impossible by any 
censorship devices to conceal the fact that, in the North, their 
countrymen, overcoming great difficulties, were successfully building 
their own free state -- the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. 
It is easy to explain the mortal hatred of Ngo Dinh Diem for the 
Democratic Republic of Vietnam, for its leaders -- one bone and one 
flesh of his own people. The bloody Diem, urged on by the American 
advisors, was feverishly equipping his army with arms which the USA 
was sending to him, in violation of the Geneva agreement. He was 
dreaming about "the campaign to the North," about a new bloody war. 
Such was the portrait of the President Ngo Dinh Diem. It is 
possible to give the essence of this corrupt, cruel) lying Pharisee 
in one word. This word is betrayer of his people.

canal, along the road which passes through the place, where I am now 
sitting and writing this correspondence, the dead were scattered about 
everywhere. It is difficult for me to write about all this, but this 
is necessary, in order that the conscience of the civilized humanity 
be revolted by the evil deed committed by the English and the French." 
These lines the correspondent of the Indian newspaper Amrita Bazar  
Patrical Shibdaz Banerzhi wrote in Port?Said, tortured, half?destroyed 
by the English and French colonizers. 
Having undertaken the attack upon Egypt, the aggressors took venge?
ance on its people because it had decided to return the Suez Canal to 
itself. This canal had been created at the cost of the lives of 120,000 
Egyptian workers. Firing upon Port?Said from warships, bombing from 
planes the cities and villages of Egypt, the colonizers, thrown out from 
this ancient, proud and freedom?loving country, were counting on intimi?
dating the Egyptian people, on making it kneel, on forcing it to give 
up its own sovereign right to be the master of its own country. 
It did not happens The manly resistance of the Egyptian people, 
the resolute protest of public opinion of the whole world forced the 
American?English majority of the UN to censure the aggressors. The 
firm support given by the Soviet Union, the Peoples Republic of China, 
India and other peace?loving countries to the victim of aggression, 
forced the colonizers to retreat. 
Having been defeated in the method of undisguised robbery and 
plundering, the colonizers wanted now to achieve their goals, and re?
sorted to intrigue and blackmail, now depending upon the aid of the 
American monopolists. However, even in this method, just as in the 
method of undisguised colonialism, they were defeated. It was impos?
sible to replace the yoke of colonialism about the necks-of people 
fighting for freedom. 
The Suez Canal is one of the largest hydrotechnical constructions 
in the world. The most important waterway of the present, created by 
the labor of tens of thousands of obscure Egyptian workers -- fellahs, 
completely and undividedly belongs to their descendants. In order to 
construct the Suez Canal of almost 173 kilometers, the Egyptians had 
to remove by hand 275 million cubic meters of earth and lay 3.8 mil?
lion cubic meters of concrete. 
The canal has been playing this most important role in the economy 
of many countries of the world for nearly 100 years. Passing entirely 
through the territory of Egypt, it is the key link of the shortest sea 
route from Europe to Southeast Asia and to the Far East. The canal 
reduces some sea communications 8,000-15,000 kilometers. A oil tanker

passes from the Persian Gulf to Marseilles around Africa in 67 days. The 
Suez Canal permits ships to go to Marseilles in 15 days. The main mass 
of goods turnover among countries of Europe, Southeast Asia, Australia, 
and the Far East is directed mainly through the Suez Canal. In 1955 
through it passed 14,666 ships of 45 countries of the world. They trans-
ported 115.7 million tons of freight. In the words of the Italian his-
torian Sammarco, "Egypt, or, more accurately, the Suez Isthmus...con-
trolled in antiquity and in the Middle Ages almost all the world trade, 
and in our days not less than half. This important position for Egypt, 
just as the means of communication, has a great effect upon the history 
of the Egyptian people. The destiny of this country has always been 
under the influence of various states, and often has been decided in 
fierce battle for the political and economic supremacy in the East, that 
is, in a certain sense, for world domination." 
The economic significance of the Suez Isthmus was understood in 
ancient Egypt. Attempts to dig through such a canal were undertaken 
in deep antiquity. The 20th Pharaoh of the First Seti dynasty, in the 
thirteenth century B.C., succeeded in uniting the eastern branch of the 
Nile River with the Red Sea. But the canal was subsequently destroyed. 
Seven hundred years later, during the reign of the Pharaoh Neco, there 
was an unsuccessful attempt to restore the canal. Work for the restora-
tion of the canal, which had been started at that time, was completed 
considerably later. The Roman Emperor Trojan in the second century A.D. 
continued this work, having named the canal "Annis Trojanus." 
After the conquest of Egypt by the Arabs, the canal, restored and 
improved during the reign of Emir Ibn al-Asam? the canal was named "the 
sovereign of the faithful." In the eighth century, by order of the 
Caliph of Mansur, it was filled up in order to prevent the penetration 
of European ships into Arabia. The last unsuccessful attempt to re-
store the canal, which united the eastern branch of the Nile with the 
Red Sea, was undertaken in the sixteenth century. 
A bitter struggle developed around the plans for the creation of a 
navigable waterway from the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea. It is 
known that in secret instructions which the Directoire provided Napo-
leon during his military expedition to Egypt in 1798, it directed him, 
among other things, "to open for republican forces" the path to India 
passing through the Cape of Good Hope. And when, in the 1840's the 
French began to undertake practical measures for the realization of 
their plan for the construction of the Suez Canal, the English opposed 
this with all their might. They remembered well that Napoleon had in 
his time been ordered "to drive out the English from all the possessions 
of the East."

Giving the French entrepreneur Lesseps the order of the Sultan for 
the organization of the work for the construction of the canal through 
the Suez Isthmus, Said-pasha, the deputy of the Turkish sultan in Egypt, 
had in mind the construction of a canal which would bring the country 
huge material and political advantages. In the order there were espe-
cially mentioned the advantages "which the uniting of the Mediterranean 
Sea with the Red Sea by a navigable way for large ships would present 
for Egypt." 
The French, English and Americans were against the nationalization 
by the Egyptian government of the Suez Canal Company. They declared 
that Egypt did not have the right to do this, inasmuch as the company 
was not a national Egyptian enterprise, to which, naturally, the laws 
of the country applied, but an international company, which stood out-
side the sphere of the application of national laws. 
Is that really the case? Even the simplest check-up indicates 
that this is far from true. 
According to the first order of the Said-pasha, which was the pre-
liminary act of the concession, the charter of the proposed joint-stock 
Suez Canal Company was subject to the approval by the Egyptian govern-
ment. Only with its preliminary consent could changes be introduced 
into the charter. The director of the company had to be appointed by 
the Egyptian government, to whom was to be given 15 percent of the net 
profit of the company, 75 percent of the income which belonged to the 
company itself and LO percent of that of its founders. The period of 
the concession was fixed at 99 years, counting from the day of the 
opening of the canal. "After the completion of the term of the con-
cession," it was stated in this document, the Egyptian government will 
occupy the place of the company, will enjoy without limitations n11 its 
rights and will come into full possession of the canal...." 
Thus, the Suez Canal Company, which the imperialists want to repre-
sent as "an international organization," from its very inception has 
been an Egyptian enterprise, subject to the internal laws of the country. 
Lesseps 1 who, incidentally, was the uncle of the wife of Napoleon 
III, not waiting for the complete formation of the concession, set about 
the organization of the Suez Canal Company. Four hundred thousand 
shares, at 500 francs each, were issued. Not waiting also for the 
ratification of the concession by the Sultan of Turkey, Lesseps in 
November 1858 began to place the shares of the company, half of which 
-- 200,000 -- was distributed in France. The English at that time in 
every way were inhibiting the construction of the canal, using for this 
purpose the supreme ruler of Egypt at that time -- the Turkish Sultan. 
However, in this struggle, France ultimately won the victory. Work on 
the construction of the canal was begun on 25 April 1859.

The people of Egypt made innumerable sacrifices in the creation of 
this vast project. According to the agreement with the company, 
30,000-40,000 fellahs were sent every month into the work of digging 
the canal. This caused great damage to the agriculture of the country. 
According to the admission of the well-known historian the Frenchwoman 
Juliette Adam, "a vast number of these workers died under the weight of 
such an exhausting duty; in addition, nothing was paid to their families, 
either by the company or by the Egyptian government." 
The final convention concerning the construction of the Suez Canal 
was signed on 22 February 1866. According to its clauses, the Suez Canal 
Company is "an Egyptian company, is governed by laws and customs of the 
country." All disputes in Egypt between the company and private persons 
of any nationality, it was stated in the convention, will be decided by 
local courts. Disputes between the Egyptian government and the company 
also will be brought before local courts and decided in accordance with 
the laws of the country. In other words, the Suez Canal Company from the 
very beginning was an Egyptian enterprise. What is more, it was directly 
indicated in the convention that the Egyptian government has the right 
to occupy "any position or any strategic point in the canal zone which 
It will consider necessary for the defense of the country." Only "in 
matters which concern its organization as a company and the relations 
of its stock-holders is it regulated on the basis of a special conven-
tion by laws under which joint-stock companies are controlled in France." 
Now clinging to this stipulation, without to any extent, refuting Egyptls 
ownership of the canal and its right to control all its affairs, the 
French, and behind them the English and Americans are trying to attach 
the appearance of legality to their imperialistic importunities for the 
Suez Canal. 
The Suez Canal came at a dear price for the people of Egypt. The 
country was exhausted. Egypt's foreign debt by 1873 reached 68,497,000 
Egyptian pounds. The attempts of the Egyptian government to get out of 
financial difficulties were unsuccessful -- the foreign banks refused 
to grant it a new loan. The rulers of the country at that time had to 
resort to the sale of Egyptian control of a packet of shares of the com-
pany of the Suez Canal. England took advantage of this. In deep se-
crecy, Prime Minister Disraeli at that time acquired for England 172,602 
(that is 44 percent) shares of the company of the Suez Canal for only 
3,976,580 pounds sterling. 
Having bought for a mere trifle an important share in the income 
from the exploitation of this most important seaway, Disraeli declared 
at a meeting of the House of Commons: "I always had presented and 
recommended this matter to the country as a political transaction, as 
a transaction, which was destined to strengthen the empire...."

As a result of the maneuvers of the colonizers, Egypt was deprived 
of the very minimum material compensation: not only 44 percent of the 
shares of the Egyptian government had gone into the hands of Englishmen, 
but also 15 percent of the income, stipulated for Egypt by the conces-
sion agreement, were intercepted by the French. Having paid that meager 
Sum for 44 percent of the shares of the Suez Canal Company (subsequently 
the number of shares bought up went up to 800,0000 with England's por-
tion being 353)504 shares), England made enormous profits on them. 
After the second world war the shares which belonged to England were 
already estimated at several hundred million pounds. To an equal ex-
tent, French shareholders grew rich. In spite of all this, the canal 
remained an integral part of Egyptian territory, and the Suez Canal 
Company remained an Egyptian enterprise, all the property of which in 
1968 was to become the property of the Egyptian government. Having 
adopted on 26 July 1956 the resolution concerning the nationalization 
of the property of the former Suez Canal Company, the government of 
Egypt performed the most legal sovereign act. Even such pettifoggers 
as Dulles could not question the legality of this nationalization. 
Unleashing the aggression against Egypt, the English and French 
imperialists asserted that they were striving to guarantee freedom of 
navigation through the Suez Canal. But, as events indicated, Egypt 
was not threatening his freedom. It was being threatened by the 
unasked "defenders" of this freedom -- England and France, who were 
violating navigation along the canal. 
How does the matter stand with this freedom of navigation along 
the canal? 
Article 14 of the concession act of 5 January 1866, which has not 
become invalid even up to the present time, directly states: "We 
solemnly announce...a large sea canal from the Suez to Peluzium and 
the ports connected with it are open, neutral ways forever...for any 
trade ship, which passes from one sea to the other, not making any 
difference, exception, and preference for whomever, it might be, and 
whatever the nationality." This article has been strictly observed 
and is being observed by Egypt. 
Freedom of navigation along the canal was confirmed in 1882 in 
a special report, signed at the Constantinople Conference of six 
powers: Russia, England, France, Italy, Austria-Hungary, and Germany. 
Then, on 29 October 1888 in Constantinople was signed the conven-
tion which confirmed "the existence of a definite order, which must 
protect for all times and for all states free use of the Suez Canal," 
In accordance with this convention the canal must be "always free and 
open for all commercial ships and warships, without differentiation of 
- 384 -

Approved For Release 2001/07/28 : CIA-RDP65-00756R000300270001-9 
flags" both in war, as well as in peace time. The right of blockade of 
the canal must never be used. The powers must not in any way violate 
the guarantee of the canal and its branches, the inviolability of its 
material part, must not permit any military operations in the region 
of three nautical miles from the ports on the canal or operations, 
whose purpose is the violation of free navigation along the canal, not 
to keep any warships in its waters. 
Observation over the fulfillment of this convention was entrusted 
to the representatives of the powers who had signed the convention. 
Upon the arising of a threat to the inviolability of the canal they 
must inform the Egyptian government of it so that "proper measures for 
the guarantee of free use of the canal" may then be taken. 
Thus, according to the convention, freedom of navigation through 
the canal is guaranteed by the Egyptian government and not any other 
government. The convention does not preclude measures which the 
Egyptian government has to take for the defense of Egypt under the 
condition of observance of freedom of navigation. 
England, which had occupied Egypt by this time, signed the con-
vention of 1888. However it inserted into it a stipulation that the 
conditions of the convention apply only within the limits of their 
compatibility with the English occupation of Egypt, and only if they 
do not "disturb the freedom of operations" of the English government. 
In 1904, at the signing of the Anglo-French treaty concerning the 
division of the sphere of influence in Africa, England replaced this 
stipulation by another, according to which Egypt was deprived of the 
right to take "appropriate measures to guarantee the free use of the 
canal." 
During World War I, England, in spite of the conditions, led her 
troops into the canal zone, constructed fortifications and established 
its complete control over the passage of ships through the canal. It 
established a military protectorate over Egypt. 
In a difficult struggle Egypt achieved, in 1922, a formal aboli-
tion of the shameful colonial regime. However the domination of Eng-
land in Egypt continued for about a quarter of a century longer on the 
basis of agreements and the treaty involving the alliance. 
It is characteristic, however, that, even pressing the enslaving 
agreement of 1936 upon Egypt, England could not recognize the Suez 
Canal as an integral part of Egypt. It confirmed the right of Egypt 
to guarantee the freedom and safety of navigation through the canal. 
At the same time, England was systematically violating the convention 
of 1888 and the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936. In 1951 English war-
ships occupied the ports of the Suez Canal, and more than 80,000

English soldiers were sent into the canal zone. In a note to the English 
Embassy of 29 November 1951 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Egypt noted 
that "the Suez Canal, which is a seaway of international importance, at 
the present time has been actually taken over by one foreign power, namely 
Great Britain." 
As concerns the attitude of Egypt to the freedom of navigation, 
Nasser, President of the Egyptian Republic, declared: "Nationalization 
does not in any way, nor in any measure, affect the international obli-
gations of Egypt." The convention of 1888, he indicated, will be com-
pletely preserved; "freedom of navigation through the Suez Canal is not 
infringed upon and is not affected in any way nor to any extent." 
Thus stands the matter with the "problem" of freedom of navigation 
along the Suez Canal. 
England systematically violated the conditions concerning the free-
dom of navigation. Having unleashed the aggression against Egypt, England 
and France not only most grossly violated this freedom, but put it out of 
operation for a long time. 
Such operations of the colonizers could not to any extent be justi-
fied by the assertions of the governments of England and France that they 
had undertaken an attack upon Egypt for the purpose of stopping the mili-
tary operations which Israel had begun against Egypt. 
As concerns the property rights of the stockholders of the Suez 
Canal Company, the resolution of the Egyptian government concerning the 
nationalization of this company clearly states that "the stockholders 
and holders of the original shares will receive compensation for their 
shares according to prices quoted on the Paris securities exchange on 
the day previous to the present lawls entering into effect." The resolu-
tion of the Egyptian government concerning the nationalization of the 
Suez Canal Company completely corresponded to the standards established 
by the concession acts for the period of the expiration of the term of 
the concession. Consequently, the whole "conflict" amounted to this: 
the transfer of the company to Egypt, stipulated 88 years before, had 
been carried out 12 years ahead of time. 
* * * 
The armed attack upon Egypt, organized by the imperialists of Eng-
land, France and started by Israel, was bloody revenge for the completely 
legal resolution of the Egyptian government nationalizing the Suez Canal 
Company and transferring into its hands control over the canal which 
belonged to it. Beginning their military attack, the imperialists were 
counting on a quick victory over this country. They wanted to frighten

the Egyptian people, to make it kneel down and subject it to their will, 
in order to dictate its conditions of control over the canal to the 
Egyptian people, 
Behind the armed aggression against Egypt stood the powerful im-
perialistic monopolies. Indeed, with the former Suez Canal Company were 
connected the largest ship and oil companies of England, France and the 
USA: the Iraqi Oil Company, the former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Rocke-
fellerts Standard Oil of New Jersey, the French Oil Company, the French 
Bank of Indo-China, English, French and Franco-German arms production 
concerns. They all were in some degree interested in having the control 
of the canal not be Egyptian. They did not want to lose the source of 
unprecedented enrichment: by 1954 the annual profits of the company 
reached the huge sum of 10.5 billion francs. 
But this was not the whole issue. Trying to organize the reprisal 
against the people of Egypt, the imperialists did not conceal their in-
tention of frightening the other countries of the Near East, in whose 
consciousness, as the press of Western countries unanimously recognized, 
there matured more and more, for example, the idea of the nationaliza-
tion of foreign concessions for the exploitation of oil deposits in 
those countries. The American oil monopolies, admitted the newspaper 
New York Herald Tribune, fear that if Egyptts nationalization of the 
Suez Canal Company remains unpunished, then "a precedent will be created, 
which in essence will stimulate other Near Eastern countries to seize 
oil concessions and oil pipelines under the pretense of nationalization." 
The organ of big capital of USA, the New York weekly Newsweek expressed 
the fear that the successes of Egypt in the field of the realization of 
its legal rights to the canal "effect the imagination of the Arab peo-
ples." 
The thrust of the imperialists was directed against Egypt not only 
because, being located at the junction of the continents, it has vast 
strategic importance as the hub of the most important communications. 
The fact is that, first of all, Egypt recently began to play an impor-
tant role in the activization of the anti-imperialistic position of the 
countries of the Arab East. 
In 1951 the majority of Arab countries resolutely refused to enter 
the aggressive war bloc, proposed by the western powers in the form of 
the so-called "Middle East Command." In 1955 the Arab countries reso-
lutely censured Iraq for its participation in the creation, on the ini-
tiative of England and with the direct encouragement of the USA, of the 
aggressive military group -- the Bagdad Pact, In December 1955 the 
attempts of England to draw Jordan into the Bagdad Pact failed.

Recently the Arab countries, following their national interests, 
began to expand trade, economic and cultural connections with countries 
of the democratic camp, countries of the people's democracies, with the 
Soviet Union and the Peoples Republic of China. 
IA Bandung was held the historic conference of countries of Asia 
and Africa, which had laid at the basis of the foreign policy of its 
participants the well-known principles of peaceful coexistence of states 
with different social systems. 
In all these events the Egyptian Republic played a large role. 
In the conditions of the development of the national-liberation 
struggle of the peoples of Asia and Africa, the process of disintegra-
tion of the colonial system began to increase at an unprecedented tempo. 
In a short time, especially after the second world war, separated from 
the colonial system were the most extensive territories, richest coun-
tries, populated with hundreds of millions of peoples. On the road of 
independent development stood Syria, Lebanon, India, Pakistan, Burma, 
Ceylon, Indonesia, Ghana, Malaya, Jordan, Libya, Indo-China, Sudan and, 
finally, Morocco and Tunis. The ground was burning under the feet of 
the colonizers in Kenya and in many other countries, whose peoples rose 
up in the sacred struggle for their liberation from the age-old colonial 
yoke. 
In this struggle of the peoples for their liberation from colonial 
domination, Egypt occupied one of the most advanced positions. After 
the liquidation of the corrupt monarchy it became the center for the 
assembling of the forces of the Arab states in the struggle against the 
new forms of imperialistic enslavement of the eastern peoples. 
In October 1954, England was forced to sign an agreement concern-
ing the removal of its troops from the territory of Egypt. England had 
been keeping troops there since 1882. Egypt began to reconstruct its 
national defense on an independent basis, reorganizing its armed forces 
without the trusteeship of the military advisors, specialists and ex-
perts of the western powers. All this led to Egypt's beginning to 
assume, for other eastern countries, the status of an example for the 
conducting of an independent national policy, which liberated the coun-
try from the domination of many years of the western powers. Egypt's 
putting into effect of the principles of the Bandung conference more 
and more strengthened its independence, converted it into an important, 
independent factor of international policy. 
This also provoked the attack of the English and French colonizers, 
who had lost their heads, upon the country, upon the country which had 
only recently achieved national liberation from the yoke of imperialism, 
and had started on the road of independent development.

Extending its campaign against Egypt, the imperialist powers decided 
to begin with economic pressure. Through economic pressure they were 
counting on making the country bow down and dictating their will to it. 
For this purpose, the USA and England unexpectedly declared that they 
refused to extend credit to Egypt for the construction of the Aswan Dam 
and the powerful hydroelectric power station on the Nile River, in spite 
of the understanding which had been reached in December 1955. This was 
a strong blow for Egypt. Realization of the project would permit Egypt 
to obtain a sufficient quantity of cheap electric power, to construct a 
powerful chemical fertilizer plant, and to increase the area of cultivated 
lands in the country by 33 percent, bringing it up to 8 million feddan. 
Refusing credits for the construction of the Aswan Dam, the USA and 
England openly declared to Egypt that they had resorted to this because 
the independent policy followed by the Egyptian government did not suit 
them. "They want to punish Egypt because it had refused to participate 
in military blocs, and because it fought for peace and for peaceful coex-
istence of the states," stated President Nasser in his speech in Alex-
andria on 26 July 1956. In that very same speech the President of Egypt 
indicated that, for the realization of the plans of economic development 
of Egypt, including the construction of the Aswan Dam, Egypt would use 
part of the income of the Suez Canal Company, which reached 35 million 
pounds per year, of which Egypt received only 1 million, 
Such were the circumstances under which, on.26 July'1956; the 
Egyptian government nationalized the Suez Canal Company. 
What did the governments of England and France do? Did they 
recognize this legal and just act? 
Not at all. 
The English government sequestered all the sterling accounts of 
Egypt in the Bank of England and all the assets of the former Suez Canal 
Company in England. 
At the same time the English government, in the words of Prime 
Minister Eden, decided to take "certain measures"'?of a military charac-
ter." It is true that from the very first moment of this warlike fever 
in England sober voices began to be heard. Gaitskill, leader of the 
Labor Party, for example, declared: "We must not tolerate such a situa-
tion, when we would be censured in the Security Council as aggressors 
or when the majority of the Assembly would be against us." These warn-
ings did not sober up the venturesome politicians of 10 Downing Street. 
It is significant that the USA occupied a special position on the 
Suez question. It did not brandish its arms, did not threaten Egypt 
with war. But the USA not only supported the Anglo-French measures 
-389?

preventing a peaceful settling of the Suez problem and directed at the 
unleashing of a war against Egypt, but also tried to thrust upon Egypt 
the unacceptable conditions which deprived it of sovereign rights in 
respect to the canal. The declarations of the statesmen of the USA in 
essence supported the aggressive position of England and France. 
This is clear. The USA had to take into consideration the fact 
that peoples of all countries of the East unanimously approved the 
resolution of the Egyptian government. And an openly hostile position 
with respect to Egypt could cause irreparable damage to the United 
States, threaten the richest American oil concessions in Saudi Arabia, 
Kuwait, on the Bahrein islands and in Iran, and also the trans-Arabian 
oil pipeline, which passes through the territory of four Arab states. 
All this forced the USA to occupy, in words, a position acceptable to 
the Arabs. But as a matter of fact, their position was hostile to 
Egypt. This, undoubtedly, also induced England and France to aggres-
sion against Egypt; it started with the armed attack of Israel upon 
Egypt. Israel crossed the Egyptian border on the very same day, when 
in accordance with the resolution of the Security Council, the repre-
sentatives of England, France and Egypt had to meet in Geneva for the 
peaceful settlement of the Suez problem through negotiation. 
* * * 
The Anglo-Franco-Israeli aggression cost Egypt a great deal. 
Cities were destroyed, historic monuments and great material values 
were destroyed, thousands of innocent people were killed and wounded. 
But the "civilized" barbarians of the 20th century had miscalculated. 
They could not make the people of Egypt bow down. Manfully rising up 
for the defense of their homeland, their independence, they upset all 
the calculations of the imperialists, frustrated the plans of the colo-
nizers. They withstood the onslaught of three states and defended 
their independence in this difficult and unequal struggle. The Egyp-
tian people did not remain alone in the face of aggression. The USSR 
and other peace-loving countries of the world rendered it much aid in 
its just struggle. By their common efforts the notorious imperialistic 
policy "from the position of strength" failed. The Anglo-Franco-
Israeli aggressors suffered a moral-political and military defeat. And 
only with great difficulty, by means of various behind-the-scene man-
euvers in the UN, the United States succeeded in protecting the aggres-
sors -- England, France, and Israel -- against serious responsibility 
for the war which they had unleashed. 
It is significant that the military venture of England, France 
and Israel caused great damage to the peoples of these countries. In 
England and France the shortage of oil and oil products began to be 
felt sharply. Production was decreased, unemployment began to increase.

England and France had to spend their dollar reserves for purchase of oil 
at increased prices in the US. The American magazine Newsweek, in its 
issue of 18 March 1957, calculated the direct and indirect losses of Eng-
land and France caused by their aggression against Egypt. In England 
they reached 725 million dollars, of which for direct military expendi-
tures were spent 125 million, for additional expenses for the supply of 
oil from the Western Hemisphere -- 320 million, for the rise in prices 
of sea transport around the Cape of Good Hope -- 100 million. Acting 
in accordance with its rights as a victim of aggression, Egypt seques-
tered 180 million dollars of English property. 
The attack upon Egypt cost France 1,307 million dollars, of which 
57 million was spent for military expenditures; losses connected with 
the cessation of navigation through the canal reached 250 million; Egypt, 
as the victim of aggression, sequestered 1,000 million dollars of French 
property. 
But the failure of the Anglo-Franco-Israeli aggression against Egypt 
did not sober the pretenders to colonial domination. The United States 
of America, taking a series of measures, directed at the strengthening 
of its colonialistic positions in the countries of the Near and Middle 
East, advanced the "theory" of the so-called "power vacuum," which would 
be formed in the Near and Middle East in connection with the failure of 
the Anglo-French military venture against Egypt and the loss of their 
influence in this region. The theory of "the power vacuum" was invented 
in order to justify the attempts of the United States to fill up this 
"vacuum," that is to occupy the positions of its rivals and competitors 
in the countries of the East. 
The imperialistic policy of USA in the Near and Middle East was 
cynically set forth by Secretary of State Dulles in a secret memorandum, 
presented by him to President Eisenhower. This memorandum was published 
on 10 March 1957 in a Berlin newspaper Neues Deutaidaadd. 
Dulles reasoned that England and France could never again become 
masters of the situation in this region. At the same time, Egypt and 
other Arab countries were beginning to understand that they themselves 
can decide their own affairs, and they were trying to liberate them-
selves from the hated trusteeship of the West. Proceeding from this, 
Dulles planned the course of American policy. The main problem, he 
declared, was the overcoming of Arab nationalism (that is the move-
ment for freedom from the colonizers), and the filling up of the 
"vacuum" which formed. Dulles proposed to accomplish the overcoming 
of "Arab nationalism" by means of the formation in this region of ag-
gressive military blocs. He wanted to fill up "the vacuum" with Ameri-
can military bases and by sending into this region American military 
units designated for "special purposes," on "the Formosa pattern."

In brief, Dulles' memorandum stipulated the replacement of English 
and French domination in the Near and Middle East by American bondage. 
The imperialist policy formulated by Dulles lay at the basis of the so-
called "Eisenhower Doctrine." 
The peoples of the Arab countries resolutely protested against this 
"doctrine." They well understood that American imperialism did not any 
more differ from Anglo-French imperialism than the yellow devil differs 
from the blue devil. 
In striving to establish its colonial domination in the Near and 
Middle East instead of the English and French, the USA Olotted a large 
place to the problem of the Suez Canal. It was striving to press upon 
Egypt a decision which would permit the oil monopolies of the US to 
become the real masters of Egypt. Exerting intensified political and 
economic pressure upon Egypt, they were trying to achieve "internation-
alization" of the canal -- the establishment of the control of US and 
its partners over the canal. In answer to this, the Egyptian government 
published, in March and April 1957, declarations on the Suez Canal ques-
tion. In them it was indicated that Egypt would completely fulfill the 
convention of 1888, and, in accordance with instructions relating to the 
order of navigation, would leave charges for ship passage at the former 
level, and would not prevent the passage of English and French ships 
through the canal, if these ships would pay the charges according to 
the existing rules. 
But the colonizers did not want to reconcile themselves to the fact 
that Egypt was the real owner of the canal. The British powers for a 
long time did not permit English ships to use the canal. The French 
governing circles threatened to boycott the Suez Canal. But subsequently 
the English and the French had to permit their ships to go through the 
Suez Canal on general grounds. 
The trouble of the imperialists around the Suez Canal cannot de-
ceive anyone. The people of Egypt, the Arab and peace-loving peoples 
of the whole world attentively watched the operations of the colonizersp 
with whatever "doctrines" they might cover themselves. The Egyptian 
people, with the support of the peace-loving peoples of other countries, 
will resolutely repulse any intrigues of the imperialistic enemies of 
the freedom, independence, happiness, and prosperity of the peoples of 
the Arab East.

"The Middle East is important for the US 
because oil is extracted in this region." 
-- From a speech of John Foster Dulles to a 
US Senate committee 10 May 1956. 
In the middle of June 1930 in Saudi Arabia, on the shore of the 
Persian Gulf, in the Quatuf region, appeared a small group of Bedouins. 
They were dressed in robes, wore Bedouin attire; they had the typical 
small curly beards. But, to the great surprise of the local Arabs, not 
one of them could pronounce one word in Arabic. They evidently did not 
know the Moslem customs, and did everything to remain unnoticed. The 
"Bedouins" were caught. It turned out that under those Arab robes 
American prbspectors were hiding; they had made their way to this region 
in search of oil. 
The American businessman Kenneth Edward, who was engaged in the 
drilling of wells in the Arabian desert, saved the false-Bedouins from 
severe punishment. Having interceded for them, he was able to settle 
the affair. It was explained that the American prospectors had been 
sent to Saudi Arabia by the American Mellon oil company Gulf Oil, had 
already stealthily approached the Near Eastern oil through the Canadian 
oil company which was connected with it. The Canadian oil company had 
received from the English permission for the extraction of oil in the 
Near East. 
At that time the English oil trusts were dominant in the Near East. 
They were the sovereign owners of Iranian oil. In their hands was 75 
percent of the shares of the Turkish oil company, which was working the 
oil deposit in Iraq, in the Masul region. It is true, that according 
to the agreement signed in San Remo, 25 percent of the shares of the 
Turkish oil company belonged to France; however, on the whole, the con-
cession was under control of the English. The English had an under-
standing with the Americans to the effect that the oil companies of 
the Americans would not penetrate into the Arab countries. The London 
Foreign Office (the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) obtained from the rulers 
of all the Arab countries their consent to grant concessions for pros-
pecting and recovery of oil only to English oil companies. London did 
not obtain this consent from Saudi Arabia -- the British Ministry of the 
Colonies at that time considered this country "a desert, devoid of any 
interest." 
The American concessionaires who had settled in Saudi Arabia per-
sistently set to work to expand the split which had formed in the Eng-
lish oil monopoly in the Near and Middle East. Soon the Gulf Oil Com-
pany obtained a new concession for prospecting and recovery of oil in 
- 393 -

Approved For Release 2001/07/28 : CIA-RDP65-00756R000300270001-9 
the territory of Saudi Arabia. First of all, it started prospecting for 
oil in the province Al-Khasab on the coastline of the Persian Gulf, oppo-
site the Bahrein Islands, which were under the protectorate of England. 
At that time the English still could, without much difficulty, pre-
vent the Gulf Oil Company from beginning the exploitation of the conces-
sion which it had obtained; this greatly troubled the Americans. 
Therefore in 1933 the Americans organized the resale of their oil 
concession in Saudi Arabia to a more powerful firm -- to the American 
Standard Oil of California, which paid a fabulously low sum for it 
-- $50,000. Subsequently, the US Secretary of the Interior Harold 
Ickes, who headed the American Petroleum Administration during World 
War II, declared that "the purchase of the Arabian oil concession by 
Standard Oil Company of California for $50,000 was the most inconCeiv-
able bargain of our time." 
The Americans tried to represent this operation as a fortuitous 
bargain. Moreover they liked to tell how, when the emissary of Standard 
Oil returned to the board of directors of this company with the signed 
contract for the Arabian concession, he declared, in answer to question, 
!that the firm had acquired a vast mass of sand, swarm of midges and in-
tense heat, and also vast hope," in other words, everything, other than 
material advantage. In reality however this was a question of the crea-
tion of an American oil monopoly in this region of the world. 
Immediately after the transaction, Standard Oil of California en-
tered into negotiations on the joint use of the concession with another 
powerful American oil company -- Texas Oil, which at that time already 
possessed an extensive trade network, selling oil in India and in other 
countries of Asia. In 1936, the Arabian-American Oil Company -- Aramco 
-- was created. With the support of the government, the oil companies 
of the USA could now enter into a resolute struggle against the English 
oil companies which were dominant in the Near and Middle East. 
The English oil companies understood, that the creation of the 
Arabian-American Oil Company made a very significant breach in their 
monopoly in the Near and Middle East. Therefore the British govern-
ment protested against its formation to the United States government. 
However, the US State Department pretended that it did not hear any-
thing, and the protest of the English remained "a voice in the wilder-
ness." 
The new American oil company for the exploitation of the oil re-
sources in Saudi Arabia was created in just such an environment of bitter 
struggle between the English and American oil monopolies. In the words 
of the French specialist on Arabian oil,Benoit-Mechin, the development

of the predatory English and American oil monopolies went "through a con-
secutive series of crises, rivalry and Conflicts, which, although they 
proceeded in the muffled quiet of the offices of their boards of direc-
tors or in the shadow of the offices of the ministries, but nevertheless 
did not cease to be bitter, dramatic and even partially bloody." 
American statesmen and diplomats like to do a lot of empty talking, 
especially at international conferences, about private initiative, free-
dom of enterprise, and about the fact that there is no connection between 
the operations of American monopolies and American governmental policy. 
The US Secretary of State Dulles, at the London conference on the Suez 
Canal in August 1956, proposed the forcing upon Egypt of an international 
organ for the control of the canal, which would be "isolated from the 
influence of the policy of any state." However, it would be impossible 
to find an American monopoly which is not connected with the government 
of the United States of America. 
* *'* 
As far back as in the beginning of the second world war, the Chair-
man of a US Senate Committee of USA (subsequently the President of US), 
Harry Truman, wrote in his report to the Senate, that "the government 
must render to the oil companies, operating beyond the limits of the 
United States, full diplomatic support and protection." As concerns 
the activity of the Arabian-American Oil Company, the American Secretary 
of the Interior Ickes declared in plain terms: "Saudi oil belongs to 
us, because it is a raw material, necessary for the life of the US and 
its independence." At that time Aramco felt the great pressure of the 
English oil monopolies, which still could create at that time serious 
difficulties for their American competitors. 
At the climax of the second world war the Anglo-American struggle 
for oil in the Near and Middle East flared up with new bitterness. In 
the American press appeared numerous assertions concerning the fact that 
US oil reserves were running catastrophically low. A noisy campaign was 
raised for the expansion of output of oil outside the United States. 
Reflecting the interests of the oil monopolies, Secretary of the Navy 
Knox declared: "We must follow a policy of severe limitation of the use 
of American oil. Namely, this will be the first sign of the conception 
of the present foreign policy of our country. Great Britain has been 
following such a policy for many years, and we must decide on the decla-
ration of such an oil policy, which would be approved by all." Under 
the "all" evidently was meant the American oil monopolies. Having thus 
prepared the appropriate groundwork, the US government created, in June 
1943, the Petroleum Reserve Corporation. Concerning the purposes of 
this corporation, the very same Ickes quite clearly said that it was 
created "in view of the fact that private capital is not in a position 
-395-

fully to establish and support the national positions in this field, 
governmental aid and participation may be necessary. The Petroleum 
Reserve Corporation will serve these purposes, when the necessity will 
arise." 
To the Near and Middle East was sent an American engineering mis-
sion on oil problems. On 1 February 1944 it presented a report to the 
President and directors of the Petroleum Reserve Corporation. The com-
mission indicated in this report that "the center of gravity of the 
world oil production was moving from the region of the Gulf of Mexico 
and the Caribbean Sea to the Middle East, to the region of the Persian 
Gulf." In a special article, "Our Oil Resources are Running Low," 
Ickes wrote that "the capital of the oil empire is rushing to the 
Middle East, to the Persian Gulf and the countries adjacent to it, such 
as Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Bahrein and, perhaps, even Afghanistan. 
And it cannot be said that it is moving on a camel, 0 Very likely, it 
could not be put more clearly than Mr. Ickes put it. 
Soon afterwards the information was published that the governmental 
Petroleum Reserve Corporation had joined efforts with Aramco and the 
Gulf Exploration Company in Kuwait for rendering aid to these private 
American firms. The special agreement between the government of the US 
and the private companies mentioned an intention to construct an oil 
pipeline Prom the oil deposits of Aramco on the shore of the Persian 
Gulf to the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. 
The sensation in the American press and the subsequent measures of 
the US government indicated the resolute intention of the American oil 
monopolies and the government to settle more and more in the Near and 
Middle East, to free its oil firms from dependence upon the English 
and their operations in the field of extraction and transport of oil. 
The Americans displayed a more and more undisguised intention to force 
out the English from the countries of the Near and Middle East. 
The correlation of forces between the English and American monopo-
lies in the Near and Middle East by this time was determined by the 
following figures. There was extracted a total of 16.3 million tons of 
oil in 1943 in the countries of this region, not counting Iran. Of the 
total, the share of the American companies in Saudi Arabia, on the 
Bahrein Is1ands and in Iraq was 1.6 million tons, that is less than 10 
percent. At that time, according to the data of the American magazine 
Fortune, England controlled in the Middle East about 60 percent of the 
oil reserves checked, and English oil-refining plants processed about 
80 percent of the recovered oil. The US controlled only 33 percent of 
all the oil reserves, and in its plants was processed only 20 percent 
of the oil. The weakness of the position of the US at that time become 
still more obvious if it is taken into account that the output of oil 
?396?

Approved For Release 2001/07/28 : CIA-RDP65-00756R000300270001-9 
in the Near and Middle East at that time was only 5.2 percent of the total 
world output of Oil, which reached approximately 313 million tons per year. 
During the 10 years before this the share of US was less than .3 percent 
of the oil recovered In the Near and Middle East. 
Intensifying the war between "the oil of the dollar" and "the oil 
of the sterling," the United States of America achieved a quick advance-
ment of the American oil monopolies, the seizure by them of the oil re-
sources of the Middle and Near East, the definitive ousting of English 
capital from the area. The representative of Standard Oil of California, 
Colliers, declared that "Arab oil is destined to play an important role 
In international affairs not only in order to satisfy military needs, but 
also as a source of supply in the event of a possible crisis in USA." 
Making use of the weakening of the positions of England during the 
second world war, the American oil monopolies, actively supported by the 
government, rushed into battle against the English monopolies, having 
begun in the literal sense of the word to ram the English oil positions 
in the Near and Middle East. Already in August 1944 an agreement was 
reached between the US and England which essentially pressed the hitherto 
monopoly positions of England in the field of recovery of oil in the Near 
and Middle East. Especially stipulated was "the principle of equal oppor-
tunities" in respect to the prospecting and working of the oil resources, 
construction, and exploitation of oil-refining plants, and the distribu-
tion of oil. 
Scarcely had the American oil monopolies extorted from the English 
"equal" opportunities in the field of acquisition of new concessions, 
when in January 1945 this Anglo-American agreement was revised. The 
new, amended agreement which was signed reflected the fact that now it 
was not the English who were limiting the Americans, but, on the con-
trary, the Americans who were limiting the English. 
Having obtained a free hand -- "eqUal opportunities" in the Near 
and Middle East -- the Americans immediately set about the most exten-
sive use of these opportunities. 
In February 1945 an understanding was reached concerning the ex-
pansion of the territory of Aramcols concession in Saudi Arabia to 
4,400 square miles and the extension of its term to the year 2005. 
Where there is oil, there are also military bases. 
After the concession treaty on oil, there followed an agreement 
concerning the construction and use by the Americans of an air base in 
Al-Khasab. As is known, the US selected as a place for this construc-
tion the triangle Dhahran--Al-Khobar--AltAziziya, farther to the south

than Dammain, on the shore of the Persian Gulf, In March 1945 the con-
struction of this air base in Dhahran was started. The construction was 
completed in 1946. In the Near East arose one of the largest American 
airfields of world importance. 
The expansion of the scales of operations of Aramco occurred not 
only in a fierce struggle with the English, but also in conditions of 
sharp, competitive rivalry among the American oil monopolies. This 
struggle led to a redistribution of the share of participation of sepa-
rate detachments of monopolistic capital of the US. As a result Standard 
Oil of New Jersey, Standard Oil of California and Texas Oil retained 30 
percent of the shares of Aramco. Socony Vacuum obtained 10 percent of 
the shares. 
Having secured for itself, with the aid of the American government, 
the concession for so immense a territory, embracing almost all of Saudi 
Arabia with the exception of a narrow zone which passes along the coast-
line of the Red Sea -- the territory of the whole concession is equal 
to one-sixth the territory Of USA -- Aramco soon discovered four of the 
richest deposits of oil: in Dammain, in Abcaiq, situated farther south-
west than Dammain, in Qatif, at the cape of Ras at Tannura, and in Ain 
Dar. The oil fields in these regions are connected with the port in 
Ras at Tannura by a four-line oil pipeline of a total length of 155 
kilometers. 
The output of oil in the oilfields of Aramco sharply increased, and 
in 1947 exceeded 12 million tons. The share of the US in the output of 
oil in the entire Near and Middle East reached 37 percent (15.6 million 
tons) in 1947. 
The accurate geological prospecting carried out by the Americans 
indicated that in Saudi Arabia was located oneof the richest oil depos-
its in the world. 
The English sounded the alarm: the breach, made by the Americans 
in the English oil monopoly, began tO assume catastrophic dimensions; 
it threatened to liquidate completely English oil domination in this 
region. Between England and USA a serious economic conflict was becom-
ing imminent. "In prospect is a serious, muddled affair," wrote the 
well-known French economist Visson. "The sharks will set about eating 
each other without delay." 
At that time in the opposition, Churchill attacked the Labor govern-
ment in the House of Commons, trying to persuade the people that the 
government was pursuing a policy of "renunciation" of its interests in 
the field of oil in favor of the US.

Observing the strengthening by the American monopolies of USA, of 
their positions in Saudi Arabia, the English journalist I. Kimkiegh Wrote 
that the issue is the striving of the US to oust the English from Pales-
tine and regions of the Persian Gulf. "There is no doubt," he wrote, 
"that in some place of the Middle East without delay will be constructed 
a powerful American base." The English journalist was mistaken. At the 
time his lines Were being written, the American air base was Already in 
existence in Dhahran. 
. The matter did not go as far as a sharp economic conflict between 
US and England, although everyone had expected the conflict. Having 
bound itself by a policy of participation, together with the United 
States, in "the cold war," England was not in a position to offer the 
necessary resistance against the Americans. Under the pressure of the 
Americans, the English government made the usual concessions. 
American capital investments in oil in the Near and Middle East 
began to increase rapidly; the English share in the output of oil in 
the Eastern Hemisphere went down. In the countries of the Near and 
Middle East by 1949 it fell to 52.4 percent. 
Having consolidated their positions, the American oil companies 
developed feverish activity. There were built powerful oil-refining 
plants in Abgaiq? Domain, and on the Bahrein Islands. The largest of 
the oil-refining plants of Aramco, capable of processing up to 18,000 
tons of oil per day, was constructed in the region of the port of Ras 
at Tannura. 
The share of American monopolies in the exploitation of the natural 
resources of the Near and Middle East sharply increased. In 1951 the 
US share of the oil in the Near and Middle East was 52.8 million to 
(54.9 percent) of the total 96.2 million tons, and in 1955 of the total 
149 million tons, the share of US was 93 million tons (62.4 percent) of 
the oil. 
The cheap labor of the Arab workers, the starvation wages which 
Aramco paid them, permitted the oil magnates of the US to make fabulous 
profits. In 1955 Aramco received 540 million dollars profit from the 
sale of crude oil.

Dhahran. The capitol of the Saudi oil region was seized by the 
grasping oil monopolies of the US. Formerly there was a settlement here, 
a small oasis, unknown to anyone, lost in the sands. In 1935 there were 
only 7,000 inhabitants in it. Now this is a large city, which in 1953 
held about 69,000 inhabitants. In the city there are good homes, movie

theatres,.gardens, stadiums, swimming pools. But they are all located 
in the European part, called New Star. No Arab may pass through here. 
The Arabs are cooped up in another section of the city -- in the so-
called Saudi Karttye. 
The Americans built New Star for themselves. In the words of James 
de Cook, who visited Dhahran in 1951, there are in it uoleanders and 
other trees imported in boxes, grass lawns imported in carts. Everything 
in it is imported from USA. Products, starting with beer and meat, and 
ending with fresh lettuce, are supplied by the Americans. The American 
employees of Aramco live in Dhahran in the very same conditions of com-
fort as at home in the US. The American way of life is delivered here 
every week on planes or ships in the form of canned foods, vitamins, 
phonograph records, movie films and magazines." 
The Americans and other foreign specialists receive high salaries, 
and each employee costs the company 3,000 dollars before he begins to 
work in his post. 
Saudi Kartlye is the Arab section of the city. Here there are no 
cottages and modern homes with gardens and flower beds. In the standard 
wooden barracks are cooped up from 30-50 persons; they are workers who 
receive only 90 cents per day. The land, saturated with oil, is devoid 
of any vegetation. In order to see any verdure or to buy vegetables, 
the inhabitants of Saudi Kartlye have to go to Al Khobar, located 10 
kilometers from Dhahran. 
But the company does not provide all Arab workers with even such 
wretched, barrack-type quarters. 
As regards local workers -- Arabs, Aramco carries out a regime of 
cruel discrimination. It tries to substitute for workers' unions spe-
cial committees of "protection" of the rights of the workers in cases 
of conflict with the administration. 
Stirred up by the difficult labor conditions, the scanty earnings, 
the unbearable housing conditions, the Arab workers at the beginning of 
1956 directed to the government of Saudi Arabia a petition, in which 
they described their cruel treatment at the hands of the company, and 
demanded an increase in wages to the level of the foreign workers, im-
provement of the housing conditions, and the right to organize trade 
unions. However Aramco sabotaged the work of the committee appointed 
for analysis of the conflict. In answer to the fully legal complaint, 
the company began to discharge workers whom it found objectionable.

According to information of the Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, in 
Dammain on 13 June 1956 10 workers were arrested and thrown into prison. 
They were subjected to savage outrages and unmerciful beatings and tor-
tures, four of those arrested died, including a 17-year-old youth. The 
following day 58 more workers were arrested. 
The American exploiters converted Aramco into a sovereign state in 
the sovereign state of Saudi Arabia. They crudely violated the most 
fundamental rights of the local workers, subjecting the Arab patriots 
to every kind of oppression and persecution, throwing into prison per-
sons whom Aramco found objectionable. The Syrian newspaper An-Nidal 
with anger and indignation declared that in Dhahran "the American 
gentlemen look upon the local workers as slaves and bondsmen." 
In 1951, 22,395 workers were working at enterprises of Aramco. 
Among this total number of workers were 13,786 Saudi Arabians, 3,230 
Americans, 1,101 Italians) 940 Palestinians, 933 Indians, and 2,405 
other Eastern nationalities -- such as the Adenese and Sudanese and 
others. 
In 1955 the number of workers and employees of the company was 
21,073 persons. The Americans constituted 14.7 percent of them. 
Aramco received huge profits from the output of oil in Saudi 
Arabia. However it spent only very little money for the creation of 
good labor conditions, improvement of housing and sanitary conditions 
of the workers, for the planning and organization of public services 
in the cities. It is true that Aramco invested funds in the construc-
tion of electric power stations, repair shops, shipyards. The total 
capital investments of Aramco in this country reached 1.8 billion dol-
lars. But all these enterprises were intended for the squeezing out of 
profits, for inhuman exploitation of new tens of thousands of local 
Arab workers. 
The company built schools with three-year training for the young 
people of 8 to 18 years of age. But these schools embraced an extremely 
limited number of the young people, from whom the schools were training 
the labor force, trained to use modern equipment at the enterprises of 
the company. 
Aramco built medical points. But at these medical points are 
treated only such widespread diseases as trachoma, skin ulcers, malaria, 
and the like. Even such an admirer of the existing order in Saudi Arabia, 
as Gerald de Gori, very cautiously declared that it is still too early 
to say what the final effect of all these measures will be upon the popu-
lation." And indeed Aramco has been ruling in Saudi Arabia since 1937.

The directors of the company do not conceal the purpose of all their 
"measures." The Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors of Aramco, 
Floyd Oliger cynically declared that "the object, which we are pursuing, 
is the creation of a middle class of Arabs, selected from persons capable 
of fulfilling all kinds of work." These outspoken colonialistic inten-
tions were still more definitely and cynically expressed by the general 
director of the company, James McPherson. He declared: uWe are con-
vinced that in helping the Arabs to help themselves, we in the long run 
are helping ourselves." 
Such is the predatory person of Aramco, such is its colonizer role 
in the country upon whose resources, upon the labor of tens of thousands 
of its best sons, Aramco was conceived, grew up, and became strong. This 
company is one of the champions of that colonial yoke, which, as the news-
paper Al-Akhbar angrily wrote in June 1954, at times it becomes weak, 
at times it becomes stronger, but it always exists and its presence is 
the source of all misfortunes. This is the reason that the main purpose 
of the Arab peoples must be the liberation from the imperialists."

The American oil monopolies fear most of all the striving of the 
countries of the Near and Middle East for national independence, for the 
utilization of their richest resources for the good of their own national 
economy, for the liquidation of the domination of foreign capital in them. 
Therefore the monopolistic circles of the US, England, France, carry-
ing on among themselves a sharp competitive struggle, at the same time 
are blocked in the preparation of new maneuvers, directed toward the en-
slavement of the countries of the Near and Middle East. "They maintain 
the aggressive military groups which they created for this region of the 
world, as for example the notorious Bagdad pact. It is known that the 
US actually stimulated the aggression of England, France, and Israel 
against Egypt, undertaken as an act of revenge in answer to the completely 
legal nationalization by Egypt of the former Suez Canal Company, the 
nationalization whose legality even the US had to recognize. And only 
when this aggression had shamefully failed, first of all as a result of 
the firm position of the Soviet Union, which had warned the aggressors, 
the US pretended that it was also against this attack upon Egypt. 
Putting on a mask and pretending to be a friend of the people of 
Egypt and other Arab countries, the US at the same time was making plans 
of military penetration into these countries by means of the so-called 
"police forces of the UN." This consisted, in particular, in the occu-
pation by these forces of the Gaza region, and of attempts to deprive 
Egypt of the legal right to establish its own administration in the 
Gaza region after the removal of the Israeli armed forces from it.

Helping England, France, and Israel in their attempts to use and con-
solidate the results of their aggression against Egypt, the US did this 
not in order to strengthen the position of these countries, but in order 
subsequently to take their place, to try to subject the entire Near and 
Middle East to its own domination. 
The well-known American document, which became the property of world 
public opinion in March 1957, when it was published in the Berlin news-
paper Neues Deutschland, indicates this very clearly. This was a secret 
memorandum, drawn up for President Eisenhower by US Secretary of State 
Dulles. With cynical frankness, the imperialistic program of the United 
States in respect to the entire Near and Middle East is set forth. 
In this document the oil companies, for whose interest Dulles was 
the mouthpiece, had to recognize the irrepressible striving of the Arab 
countries for national independence. The defeat of England and France 
in Egypt, having buried their prestige in Asia and Africa, it was said 
in the memorandum, led to a strengthening of Arab "nationalism," that is 
of the national-liberation movement. The active support which was ren-
dered and is being rendered to the countries of the Arab East by the 
Soviet Union, furthered the national-liberation movement, as the Charge( 
d'Affaires of US monopolistic capital had to admit, not concealing his 
anxiety. All this, he continued, created "a completely new situation" 
in the Near East. 
What way out did the director of US foreign policy offer? Was it 
not a renunciation of the imperialistic pretensions of the USA, England 
and France in this region? Was the recognition real, and not just a 
formal recognition of the sovereign right of the countries of the East 
to their national independence and sovereign state independence? Was 
it a recognition of the inalienable right of these countries to use 
their own natural resources for their own good without the exploitation 
and plundering of them by foreign monopolistic capital? 
No, not at alit Indeed such a program would mean the repudiation 
of the very essence of the imperialistic policy of the US. And Dulles 
was in the service of the imperialistic monopolies of American capital. 
Dulles and the oil monopolies of the US behind him were afraid 
that "Egypt and the other Arab states were beginning to understand that 
they themselves can decide their own affairs" and that these countries 
"were trying to liberate themselves from the trusteeship of the WestP 
which they hated. Dulles was frightened by the fact that "if events 
would develop in that direction, then the Arab East would soon be con-
verted into something similar to India, and that the Western powers 
would then have to build their relations with the Arab countries on 
completely new bases," that is on principles of respect of their sov-
ereignty, of the will of their people.

The imperialistic colonizer program, an attempt to avert this mis-
fortune for the American oil monopolies, was introduced in the memorandum. 
One of the requirements, advanced in the memorandum was to overcome 
the strengthening of Arab "nationalism." To fill up the "vacuum" which 
was formed, that is the void, which was created in the Arab East after 
the downfall of the imperialistic positions of England and France. In 
other words, to seize these positions, to use them in the interests of 
the US. For this purpose it is necessary, the memorandum said, to 
strengthen the military positions of the US in the Near East. To ex-
pand the program of the creation of air bases, to place in certain places 
American military forces equipped with atomic weapons, to achieve the 
consciousness of "an African military pact." 
This frankly imperialistic anti-Arab program of foreign policy of 
the United States formed the basis of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," which 
was proclaimed 5 January 1957. This "doctrine," which was approved by 
Congress, permitted the government of US "in case of necessity" to send 
American armed forces to the region of the Near and Middle East. As an 
enticement for these countries, there was stipulated economic "aid" in 
the amount of up to 200 million dollars. The purpose of this "aid," 
as is known, is frankly described in the secret letter of Nelson Rocke-
feller to the President of the US0 ln the letter, it is said directly
that "the development of economic relations with these countries (of 
the Near East - D. Danis) must ultimately give us the opportunity to 
take into our own hands the key positions in the economy of these 
countries" in order that "these countries themselves come to the con-
clusion concerning the necessity of joining the military pacts and 
alliances created by us." 
The American oil companies can permit the government to spend for 
economic "aid" to the countries of the Near and MiddleEast 200 million 
dollars: indeed they receive huge profits from the oil recovered in 
these countries. 
According to the admission of the American newspapers, the profits 
of the oil companies of the US were 3,914 million dollars in 1955. 
In order to conceal, to mask more easily the colonizer purposes 
of "the Eisenhower Doctrine," directed to the enslavement and enthrall-
ment of the peoples of the East and the consolidation there of Ameri-
can domination through the armed forces of the US, the government of 
the United States announced its decision to participate in the military 
committee of the Bagdad pact.

This did not to any essential degree change the situation, inasmuch 
as the US was the initiator of the creation of the Bagdad pact, and par-
ticipated in two of its committees, including the economic. 
The peoples of the Arab countries, Who had repulsed, with the aid 
of other peace-loving peoples, the Anglo-Franco-Israeli aggression against 
Egypt, resolutely opposed "the Eisenhower Doctrine," the attempts of the 
American oil monopolies to dominate in the Near and Middle East, to per-
petuate the predatory pillaging of the natural resources of this region 
and to preserve in a "new" look the colonial system of imperialism, hated 
by the people. 
But this system disintegrated under the powerful blows of the peoples, 
who in a stubborn struggle against the colonizers threw off the yoke of 
enslavement, achieved their national liberation, national sovereignty. 
The peoples of the East learned to recognize all the contrivances of the 
monopolists and the ruling circles of the imperialistic powers, trying 
again to place upon them the yoke of colonialism, in whatever appearance, 
in the guise of whatever "doctrines" these. attempts might be undertaken. 
The peoples of the East understood that, as the Prime Minister of Syria 
Saud AI-Gazi in May 1956 said, "the best way for the Arab countries is 
the way of independence."
