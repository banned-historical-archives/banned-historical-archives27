 Prime Minister Karami announced last night that his extra-governmental
 "security committee" had agreed to still another cease-fire.
 The committee contains representatives of Lebanon's principal Muslim and
 Christian political factions, including the right-wing Phalanges Party, but no radical
 leftists. Radicals led by Ibrahim Qulaylat have been the Phalangists' chief opponents
 in the widespread clashes this week and will attempt to keep the fighting going.
 Fighting continued in Beirut after the cease-fire announcement, according to the
 press.
 Karami came under great pressure to negotiate a new cease-fire yesterday when
 socialist leader Kamal Jumblatt joined Qulaylat and other radical leftists in charging
 that the army had intervened to rescue right-wing Phalangists in the hotel district.
 The army had in fact prevented either side from making significant new gains, but
 had failed to reduce the level of fighting. According to press reports from Beirut, as
 many as 850 army commandos and other troops have taken up positions in the
 city's commercial center. This represents the most extensive army involvement in
 internal security functions since the state of emergency in May 1973.
 If the fighting should continue at a high level or become still worse, the army
 might not be able to provide much additional help. The 18,000-man force includes
 only about 3,600 infantry troops who could be used for security duties. An
 estimated 2,000 of these troops have over the past several weeks been seconded to
 the government's exhausted 6,000-man internal security force. They have been
 guarding government buildings in Beirut, patrolling the periphery of the city,
 securing the road to the airport, and manning buffer zones between opposing
 factions in the Tripoli-Zagharta and Zahlah areas. The army's effectiveness in wider
 hostilities would be limited by an increased tendency for its units to divide along
 religious lines. Because the force so far has been used primarily for patrol duties and
 has seen little sustained combat, this has not yet become a significant problem.
 Karami's willingness to have the army stay in place to help enforce the new
 cease-fire despite leftist criticism is a result of the generally constructive attitudes
 taken by the Syrian government and  leaders of the Palestine  Liberation
 Organization. The Lebanese branch of the Syrian Baath Party has been one of few
 groups to reaffirm its support for Karami this week. Palestinian leaders have helped
 by avoiding criticism of the army, by endorsing the latest cease-fire, and by privately
 ordering their forces to stop backing the increasingly powerful Qulaylat.

 The Prime Minister is attempting to mimimize the damage to his political
 position by claiming that the army was ordered in by Interior Minister Shamun, a
 Christian, and that army forces remain under the command of the internal security
 forces. Karami has also pointed out that the government has not declared a state of
 emergency, which theoretically is required for army intervention.

 ASIA-US
 Japan and South Korea have praised President Ford's speech in Honolulu this
 week, but North Korea has strongly denounced it.
 The Japanese are clearly pleased that Washington has reaffirmed  its
 commitment to play an active Asian role and the importance of the US-Japan
 alliance. Both the President's trip and his address were widely publicized in Japan,
 with editorial comment emphasizing the US resolve to remain a Pacific power. Since
 the fall of Indochina, there has been some concern in Tokyo that a US retrenchment
 in Asia could bring instability damaging to Japanese interests.
 Tokyo is pleased to see that US relations with Peking remain on course and to
 note indications of a flexible US approach to Indochina. The Japanese also view the
 President's visits to Jakarta and Manila as important symbols of continued US
 involvement in Southeast Asia.
 South Korea has generally expressed satisfaction with the speech, focusing
 more narrowly on Washington's determination to maintain its commitments to allies
 in Asia. President Ford's comments on the importance of maintaining security and
 peace in Korea and his statement that Seoul must participate in any dialogue on the
 future of Korea were particularly well received.
 Hoping to see a further US withdrawal from Asia after the fall of Indochina,
 Pyongyang has reacted in predictably vitriolic fashion. Denouncing US policy as
 aimed at perpetuating the division of Korea, Pyongyang also directed special
 criticism at the US-Japan alliance and ignored the President's remarks about
 improving US-Chinese relations.
 Hanoi, meanwhile, has rejected the President's expression of good will toward
 Vietnam, stating that the US still refuses to address the issue of compensation for
 war damages. The Vietnamese have maintained that Article 21 of the Paris
 Agreement, which calls for "healing the wounds of war," is still in effect and that
 war reparations must be negotiated before any consideration can be given to the
 establishment of diplomatic relations.

 CHINA
 December 11, 1975
 The left wing of the Chinese Communist Party, which has watched the
 excessive policies of the Cultural Revolution being overturned in the past year, has
 launched a strident propaganda counterattack. This assault focuses mainly on the
 new educational policies announced this fall but includes a broader defense of the
 Cultural Revolution in general and of the "new things," a codeword for policies
 adopted during that turbulent period.
 An article carried in the party's two major publications attacks point by point
 the shifts in educational policy announced in a speech by the minister of education
 and reportedly endorsed by Chairman Mao. It dismisses as ridiculous the charge
 made by the education minister that the universities have failed to provide quality
 education. It specifically criticizes the notion that the universities must emphasize
 basic technical courses, a direct rebuttal to the reported statements of Mao and the
 education minister on the need to increase the study of basic scientific theory. It
 attacks the policy, reportedly approved by Mao in 1974, of sending students directly
 to the universities without their having spent a few years in the rural areas first.
 The article also reiterates the favorite leftist position that political training is
 the most important function of the universities, despite the reported statement by
 Mao that university students need not study politics in college but can do so at their
 places of employment.
 The article has prompted one communist official to express his concern over a
 possible resurgence of ultra-leftist activity. After a steady erosion of leftist political
 influence, particularly in the cultural arena, the recent changes in educational policy
 forced the leftists with the choice of striking back or abandoning their last remaining
 area of influence to the moderate coalition headed by Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping.
 The educational debate has apparently caused some disruption in two of
 China's most prestigious universities, those in Peking and Tsinghua, where students
 on both sides of the issue have put up wall posters. Some posters complain that
 educational policies are depriving students of a good education, while others attack
 what they see as a return to the "elitist" policies in vogue before the Cultural
 Revolution. The latter posters include specific attacks on the minister of education,
 whom they blame for reinstituting higher educational standards.
 Leftist assaults on the new educational policy will probably stave off,
 temporarily at least, any major changes in the education system. Efforts to regain
 some lost ground and to expand this attack into a defense of the Cultural

 Revolution are likely to meet with less success. The broader attack is contained in an
 article by Liang Hsiao, a pseudonym for an unidentified but influential person or
 group in the party leadership. This article attacks those who have "negated" the
 policies of the Cultural Revolution by endless criticism. The only specific policy
 mentioned is that of education, but the defense of the "new things" that emerged
 during the Cultural Revolution is clearly meant to include a wide range of policy
 issues.
 This broad attack is a response not only to the changes made recently in
 Cultural Revolution policies and to Mao's apparent abandonment of the left, but
 also undoubtedly to the growing power and prestige of Teng Hsiao-ping. Teng is a
 particular irritant to the party's left wing because, as a victim of the Cultural
 Revolution, he personifies all of the "evils" that the leftists wanted to eradicate
 during that period.
 It is precisely Teng's power, greater now than before the Cultural Revolution,
 that is likely to confine leftists' attacks to propaganda broadsides, while limiting
 their actual influence over policy. Nevertheless, these recent articles clearly
 demonstrate that the left retains access to the media and is capable of stirring up
 propaganda debates. In the past year, the left has been unable to sustain an attack
 on current policies. If kept up over time, such leftist activity could force the
 hard-nosed Teng to take firm action against his antagonists or, in the tradition of
 Premier Chou En-Iai, to tread more cautiously in nyertiirninn  he policies of the

 CHINA-ANGOLA
 Peking's policy toward Angola continues to reflect Chinese efforts to capitalize
 on Moscow's heavy-handed support for the Popular Movement. Publicly, the Chinese
 are maintaining a position of strict neutrality, and there is no evidence that any
 significant new amounts of Chinese military assistance are reaching the National
 Front or National Union.
 Chinese may also have given aci

 long as Peking is left with a plausible case for denying direct involvement a.
 As long as other countries maintain their current levels of assistance to the
 National Front and the National Union, China can be expected to maintain a low
 profile with its former clients, endorse the Organization of African Unity's call for
 neutrality toward Angola, and score propaganda points at Moscow's expense. Peking
 is clearly concerned, however, that it may not be able to sustain this approach.
 Any significant reduction in support for the National Front and National
 Union by other countries, for example, would present the Chinese with difficult
 ions.
 The prospect of a reversal of the Organization of African Unity's position on
 Angola or an agreement among its members to go their separate ways on the
 recognition issue would be equally unsettling to the Chinese. This would almost
 certainly lead to much wider African and Third World recognition for the Popular
 Movement and leave Peking on the wrong side of the fence. Such valued friends as
 Tanzania, Mozambique, Romania, and Yugoslavia have already followed Moscow's
 lead in formally recognizing the Popular Movement.

 are no signs, however, that Peking is seriously considering switching its political

 The offensive launched last week by the Popular Movement for the Liberation
 of Angola against Ambriz, the headquarters of the National Front for the Liberation
 of Angola, appears to have stalled some 50 miles south of its target.
 The National Front has been destroying bridges as it falls back to Ambriz and
 positions farther north. Moreover, the Popular Movement's supply lines to Luanda
 probably have been slowed by the onset of the rainy season, a factor that annually
 hampered Portuguese operations during the insurgency.
 In the fighting southeast of Luanda, forces of the National Union for the Total
 Independence of Angola yesterday retook Mussenide from the Popular Movement,
 which had captured the town the day before. The National Union had used
 Mussende as an operational base in its drive, now stalled, to take Malanje.
 A National Union spokesman announced in Lusaka, Zambia, last weekend that
 Union forces had "launched an offensive" against Henrique de Carvalho, the Popular
 Movement's major stronghold in eastern Angola. The extent of the fighting in that
 area cannot be determined.

 Preparations are under way for an extensive cabinet reshuffle that is expected
 to bring to the fore leaders who are willing to nudge Spain toward a more open
 political system.
 The new government, which could be sworn in as early as tomorrow, may
 retain only three members of the present 19-member cabinet, according to Jose
 Maria de Areilza, a prominent monarchist politician. Prime Minister Arias told
 Areilza that Juan Carlos had specifically requested that portfolios be given to
 Areilza, to former ambassador to London Manuel Fraga Iribarne, and to Christian
 Democrat Federico Silva Munoz. Areilza claimed that he would be given the Foreign
 Ministry, that Fraga would be offered the Ministry of the Interior, and that Silva
 Munoz would become minister of either justice or information.
 Arias said he would proceed only if all three men accepted the appointments.
 They will be cautious about what kind of government they might be associated with,
 but they are also very ambitious and anxious to get in on the ground floor of a new
 political era. In any case, Areilza implied that he was satisfied with Arias' assurances
 that the new government would attempt to move Spain closer to a Western-style
 democracy. Fraga had wanted to be prime minister, but the interior portfolio will
 provide him the base he wants to build a political power structure.
 Areilza said he inferred from Arias' remarks that the three ministers who will
 remain are Minister of Labor Fernando Suarez Gonzalez, one of the most liberal
 members of the current government, Minister of the National Movement Jose Solis
 Ruiz, a moderate proponent of change who is widely acceptable across the political
 spectrum, and the more conservative Minister of the Navy, Admiral Gabriel Pita da
 Veiga.
 According to Areilza, Arias may appoint General Manuel Gutierrez Mellado to
 be deputy prime minister for coordinating the three military ministries-perhaps
 foreshadowing the formation of a defense ministry in the near future. Gutierrez
 Mellado, who is the chief military spokesman at the US base negotiations, is
 generally considered one of the brightest general officers in the Spanish armed
 forces. He favors a gradual evolution of the regime and is liked by most of the
 democratic opposition, including the Socialists.
 Whatever the composition of the new government, it will face a baptism by
 fire. The localized strikes that are taking place this week are likely to be forerunners
 of more serious labor unrest this winter. A number of important collective

 bargaining contracts are due to expire on December 31, and last month the
 government extended for a year the wage freeze that was introduced last summer.
 The extension has angered the entire working class and will make the labor
 movement more receptive to Communist attempts to use the country's economic
 difficulties to organize a paralyzing general strike early next year.
 The government will also have to cope with an increasing number of potentially

 Foreign Minister Melo Antunes, a key member of Portugal's Revolutionary
 Council, has announced that the military is prepared to allow civilians a greater role
 in running the country, but he ruled out an early return to civilian rule.
 Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, Antunes conceded that the Armed
 Forces Movement-which has dominated Portugal for the past 20 months-may have
 to surrender its role as the vanguard of the revolution. He confirmed that a revision
 of the pact signed with the political parties last spring is under way, but he stressed
 that a precipitate withdrawal by the military could endanger its program for leading
 the country to socialism. Antunes, who has political ambitions of his own, was
 responding to recent demands by military and civilian leaders that the Armed Forces
 Movement relinquish power and "return to the barracks."
 Among the officers pushing for the military to withdraw from politics are a
 number of respected professional soldiers who believe the people should be allowed
 to decide whether they want socialism. Although their number and influence are not
 known, several of the officers are believed to have played a key role in putting down
 the leftist military rebellion of November 25-26. There is evidence that the strength
 of the group is growing and that it may exert increasing pressure upon the Antunes
 faction to change both its gradualist approach to returning power and its attachment
 to socialism as an unalterable goal.
 The Azevedo government, meanwhile, has survived a split in the centrist
 Popular Democratic Party. The compromise resolution on Communist participation
 in the cabinet, passed by the Popular Democrats at their congress on Saturday, has
 assured continuation of the sixth provisional government. A subsequent power play
 by party Secretary General Sa Carneiro, however, led to the resignation of the
 leadership of the party's left wing. Reacting to the secretary general's autocratic
 attempts to dominate the party secretariat, one cabinet minister, two secretaries of
 state, and 17 members of the party's delegation to the constituent assembly have
 already bolted and more defections are expected.
 Prime Minister Azevedo has agreed to allow Sa Carneiro to replace dissident
 Popular Democrats in the government, but the status of the assembly members has
 not been determined. The split has resulted in a more homogeneous party firmly
 under Sa Carneiro's control, but the party has lost some of its most effective
 political organizers. Unless a reconciliation is achieved, which now seems unlikely,
 the party may have succeeded in limiting its appeal exclusively to the right.

 Indonesia's Asian friends are working to undercut criticism of Jakarta by other
 Third World states and to work out a UN resolution on Timor that all sides can
 accept.  Members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations-Malaysia,
 Singapore, the Philippines, and Thailand-have joined other Asian statesatthe UN in
 seeking a compromise resolution on Timor that will avoid condemning Indonesia for
 aggression.
 The problem is particularly delicate for the Australian government, which is in
 the midst of a bitter election campaign. Left-wing trade unionists supporting the
 Fretilin cause of Timorese independence are being joined by usually conservative
 World War I I veterans who served in Timor and feel an emotional tie to its people.
 Australia is presently supporting a compromise resolution that avoids any mention
 of Indonesian action and talks in general about respecting the rights of Timorese
 self-determination, but the Australians fear that the resolution in its present form
 has little chance of passing.
 Even Jakarta's severest critics display no belief that Fretilin is a viable
 government worthy of substantial support as such. Both Peking and Hanoi have been
 outspoken in denouncing Indonesian aggression, but neither has recognized Fretilin's
 declaration of independence. As the self-proclaimed leader of the Third World,
 Peking must have felt obliged to criticize Jakarta, but the Chinese hope that the
 Timor issue will not become an obstruction to Peking's continuing efforts to
 improve relations with Jakarta. Hanoi took the opportunity to blame Washington
 for encouraging the Indonesian attack.

 Ties between Brazil and West Germany have been improved significantly by
 Foreign Minister Genscher's visit last month to Brasilia. Both German and Brazilian
 officials are already speaking of a "special relationship" between the two countries.
 In an exchange of diplomatic notes implementing the nuclear cooperation
 agreement signed last June in Bonn, Genscher and Brazilian Foreign Minister Silveira
 agreed to establish joint venture companies in the nuclear field before the end of the
 year. Nuclebras, the Brazilian state nuclear enterprise, will begin placing orders in
 1976 which are expected to amount to $1 billion over several years.
 The two foreign ministers also issued public statements that could be
 interpreted as playing down the role of international safeguards in nuclear policy.
 While Genscher said that the restrictions imposed by the International Atomic
 Energy Agency apply only to the binational program, Silveira asserted Brazil's right
 to undertake peaceful nuclear explosions. Genscher chose not to point out that the
 agreement specifically prohibits the use of joint projects and technology to
 undertake nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes.
 Genscher also curried favor with the Brazilians by emphasizing the importance
 of improving trade relations between the developed and less developed nations-a
 theme that has been sounded by Silveira in two recent appearances before the UN.
 It is apparent that West Germany wants to improve relations with several Latin
 American countries. Genscher also visited Venezuela and Peru to encourage a
 widening of economic cooperation. Brazil, however, is the main attraction. German
 investment there already is close to $1 billion, with over 400 firms represented. This
 extent of economic involvement is second only to West German investment in the
 United States.
 Bonn seems to view Brazil as a "bridge" to Latin America and the less
 developed nations in general, both because Brazil offers profitable opportunities for
 investment and because, as an emerging world power, it has an approach to many
 issues that is compatible with the interests of the industrialized nations. Brazil is also
 an important cultural "bridge," owing to a large population of German extraction.
 From Brazil's point of view, the relationship with West Germany provides an
 opportunity to chart a more independent foreign policy, to reduce the traditional
 dependency on the US, and to assert its national interest as a major power. This is
 especially important at a time when Brazil is becoming increasingly strident in the
 assertion of its interests in international forums.

 The maintenance of West Germany's currently favorable position in Brazil will
 of course depend in large measure on how smoothly the nuclear agreement is
 implemented. There do not appear to be any specific points of conflict at this time,
 but given the complexity of the series of agreements, there will undoubtedly be
 some difficulties.
 The two parties in Chancellor Schmidt's coalition government, after protracted
 negotiations, reached agreement this week on new legislation to increase the role of
 labor in industrial management. Both parties will push for parliamentary ratification
 in the spring.
 Many compromises were necessary, given the sharp differences between the
 Social Democrats and the business-oriented Free Democrats. Leaders of both parties
 feared, however, that the Schmidt government would lose crucial votes in the
 national elections if it could not deliver on this major reform, which was promised
 by the Brandt-Scheel administration six years ago. The coalition parties have a
 comfortable majority in the lower house of parliament, but recent polls indicate that
 the electoral challenge of the opposition Christian Democrats could be strong.
 In striking a compromise with their more conservative coalition partners, the
 Social Democrats are running a calculated risk. Trade union leaders, particularly
 spokesmen for the nation's labor federation, are disappointed in the draft legislation.
 Although workers will enjoy equal representation with management on supervisory
 boards projected for firms with more than 2,000 employees, tie votes will be broken
 by a chairman elected by each firm's stockholders.
 The concession was unavoidable after German firms and subsidiaries of
 multinational corporations raised serious legal objections to permitting unions to
 dictate or stymie management policy. The bill now should also survive attacks from
 the opposition parties, which, along with the conservative Free Democrats, had
 argued that earlier proposals were unconstitutional.
 Despite their disappointment, union leaders have indicated that they will
 respect the compromise legislation. This moderation is partly a result of strenuous
 efforts by Schmidt and Economic Minister Friderichs to persuade workers that their
 maximum demands are unrealistic.

 Joshua Nkomo, the leader of a major faction of Rhodesian black nationalists,
 announced yesterday that formal negotiations with Prime Minister Ian Smith aimed
 at achieving a constitutional settlement will begin today.
 Nkomo and Smith last week signed a "declaration of intent" to begin the
 formal talks, but they had been expected to hold another preliminary meeting this
 week to settle final details. Nkomo's announcement suggests that all procedural
 matters may already have been worked out.
 Nkomo said he would lead a 12-man delegation to the talks, but he did not
 indicate whether representatives of other nationalist factions will be included. The
 delegation almost certainly will not include Nkomo's most prominent rivals,
 Ndabaningi Sithole and Bishop Muzorewa, who have denounced from exile the
 Smith-Nkomo meetings.
 Settlement talks will be prolonged and difficult, and ultimate success is far
 from assured. In any event, Smith can be expected to employ tactics aimed at
 avoiding a final settlement for as long as possible.

 CHINA: The Chinese have released a new figure for 1974 grain output that is
 far larger than the output claimed for any previous year. At a UN conference held in
 Rome in mid-November, vice minister of agriculture and forestry Yang Li-kung
 reported that the total grain output was 274.9 million tons. This is consistent with
 US estimates of the 1974 harvest. A Western press dispatch from Peking, using this
 figure as a base, speculates that China's 1975 harvest could be more than 280 million
 tons. Peking announced recently that the 1975 harvest was "even higher than 1974,
 itself a high production year." This statement downgrades the 1974 harvest, which
 previously had been termed a record harvest, and suggests that any increase this year
 will be small
 GREECE-ROMANIA: A barter arrangement has been concluded by which
 Bucharest  will  provide  Athens 2,000  Romanian-manufactured  ARO-240
 three-quarter-ton jeeps in return for agricultural products. Delivery is to be
 completed by April, if possible, because of tensions with Turkey. Since early 1974,
 when Athens withdrew from the grant-aid portion of the US military assistance
 program, it has been purchasing military materiel from both Western Europe and the
 US. This is the first time Greece has arranged for materiel from a communist
 country specifically for military use.
