1. THE SITUATION IN HUNGARY (Information as of 2400, 
4 November) 
Fighting continues in Budapest and in 
certain isolated areas in the provinces, 
although Soviet troops and their collab-
orators in the new Hungarian "Workers 
and Peasants Revolutionary Government" 
established the morning of 4 November 
appear to be in control of all border 
areas and almost all key urban areas. 
The premier of the new Communist re-
gime, Janos Kadar, reportedly de-
clared late in the day on 4 November 
that "armed gangs of rebels are still 
murdering" and that there was still 
danger that they might get the upper 
hand. In midafternoon of the same day, 
Soviet aircraft reportedly bombed the 
western part of Budapest, some hours 
after Moscow radio had hailed the "crushing" of the "counter-
revolutionary and Fascist" forces. 
At least seven Soviet divisions are be-
lieved to be engaged in the fighting�two normally stationed 
in Hungary, two that had been brought in during the fight-
ing on 24-25 October and three that apparently moved in dur-
inz the oast several days. 
some estimates place the incre-
ment since 24 October as high as twelve divisions. In an-
swer to Ambassador Bohlen's remark on the evening of 
3 November that the USSR was still putting troops into Hun-
gary, Khrushchev answered that the Soviet Union had enough 
troops there, but if not, "We will add more and more if 
necessary!' 
Fighting continued throughout the day on 
4 November and reports of clashes between Soviet and Hun-
pwian military units are confirmed.

to cap-
ture ana disarm the Hungarian troops without violence, but 
in the event of opposition the order appears to be to destroy 
them.  the Soviet com-
manders are under orders not to conduct negotiations, to 
break opposition ruthlessly, and to disperse the population. 
Resistance to the Soviet attack, launched 
throughout the country at about 0500 hours on 4 November, ap-
parently was disorganized and conducted largely by irregular 
forces, including armed workers and students. The Hungarian 
defense minister and the chief of staff were arrested before 
the attack began by Soviet officers who had been engaged in 
negotiations--begun the previous day--with them concern-
ing Soviet troop withdrawal. Premier Nagy and most of the 
ministers in his short-lived coalition government were ar-
rested in the morning when Soviet troops captured the Par-
liament building in central Budapest. Nagy had time only to 
announce the attack over Budapest radio at 0515 and to appeal 
desperately for help from the outside world. Virtually all 
free Hungarian radio stations in the country were in Soviet 
hands by noon. 
The USSR's decision to resume military 
action against the Hungarian revolt apparently was made on 
31 October after it had become clear that the program of the 
Nagy regime would result in the severance of close Hungarian 
ties with Moscow. Mikoyan and Suslov, the two Soviet lead-
ers most closely concerned with Hungarian developments :in 
the past, arrived in Budapest on 31 October, perhaps to an-
nounce this decision to Kadar. 
The new Communist government headed 
by Kadar was formed coincidentally with the Soviet attack 
on 4 November; one of its first acts was to appeal for Soviet 
armed assistance to put down the "counterrevolution" of the 
"sinister forces of reaction' Nevertheless Kadar, in a 
speech at 0810, assailed the "Rakosi-Gero clique" for vio-
lations of legality, promised to carry out a national Commu-
nist, Gomulka-like program and, after calm is restored, 
to negotiate with the USSR and other Warsaw pact states for 
the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Hungary. 
The fate of Hungarian political leaders 
who during the past week had declared themselves in open

opposition to both the USSR and to Communism at home is un-
certain. Cardinal Mindszenty, however, has received 
political asylum in the American legation in Budapest and 
Social Democratic leader Ana Kethely was safe in Austria 
when the Soviet forces attacked. 
Reaction to the Soviet move elsewhere 
In the Soviet bloc has included echoes of the Moscow line 
from all Satellite capitals and from Peiping. Yugoslavia 
has also accepted the USSR's interpretation of Hungarian 
developments with virtually no reservations. Socialist 
party leader Nermi in Italy, however, has condemned the 
Soviet move. According to a Rome broadcast, Nenni stated 
on 4 November that the USSR's substitution of force and 
power for proletarian internationalism is unacceptable and 
expressed the hope that the Soviet Union will reconsider its 
Z.C.love, withdraw its troops, and recognize Hungary's neu-

2. HOSTILITIES IN EGYPT (information as of 2400, 
4 November) 
The Anglo-French invasion of Egypt 
began with an airborne assault at 
dawn on 5 November, according to 
a communique of the allied command. 
The objectives of the attack were not 
immediately confirmed. Anglo-French 
airborne forces on Cyprus prior to the 
attack numbered at least 7,400. Addi-
tional troops and supporting weapons and 
equipment may be airlifted in as soon as 
an airfield is secured. Seaborne as-
sault forces en route from Cyprus, 
Malta and the western Mediterranean 
will probably begin arriving within 24 
hours. Additionally, the British Third 
Infantry Division, consisting of 17,000 
men, left Southampton for the Mediter-
ranean on 1 and 2 November. The plan-
ners of the Anglo-trench operation against Egypt calculate 
that the Suez Canal zone can be occupied and controlled within 
10 days. 
Egypt has completed the withdrawal of 
its troops across the Suez Canal, and was not lured into com-
mitting its main force in Sinai. With military installations 
and transportation under heavy Anglo-French air attack, 
Egypt is attempting to disperse military vehicles, equip-
ment and supplies among the villages in the Nile delta and 
on the approaches to the canal. Nasr's plan appears to be 
to confront the Anglo-French governments with the prospect

of a long, expensive, unorthodox campaign involving war 
against the Egyptian civilian population. The canal has, 
meanwhile, been blocked by scuttling at least seven ships, 
including major canal maintenance vessels, and by demo-
lition of the Firdan Bridge. the canal's only highway cross-
ing.  
"the destruction oi Port Said has as-
sumed impressive proportions." 
Egyptian troop strength in the canal 
zone at the beginning of hostilities is believed to have been 
at least 15,000, including an armored group and three in-
fantry brigades. These forces have by this time probably 
been increased to at least 30,000 by reinforcements, largely 
armor and artillery, from Cairo and Sinai. The Israelis 
claim to have killed, wounded or captured about half of the 
36,000 Egyptian troops in Sinai at the beginning of the fight-
ing. 
Israeli forces have virtually completed 
mopping up the Sinai Peninsula with the seizure of the town 
and airfield at Tor on the Gulf of Suez, coast defense posi-
tions at Sharm al-Shaikh, and the islands of Tiran and 
Sanafir guarding the entrance to the Gulf of Aqaba. Israeli 
forces are operating in the vicinity of the canal opposite 
uez and Ismailia, and are closing toward Port Said.

3. SYRIAN AND IRAQI TROOPS ENTER JORDAN 
The recent entry of Syrian and Iraqi 
troops into Jordan raises the immediate 
prospect of Israeli counteraction by an 
attack toward the Jordan River. For 
several days Israel has been shifting 
troops to the Jordanian and Syrian bor-
ders and laying field communication 
wire. Heavy movements of tanks toward 
Jordan have been observed by American 
officials in Tel Aviv, 
The Syrians probably entered Jordan on 
1 or 2 November. According to previous 
plans of the Arab joint command in Cairo 
which were later canceled, Syria was to 
prepare one armored brigade and one in-
fantry brigade to enter Jordan for an at-
tack on Israel. The location of Syrian 
troops in Jordan is unclear, although 
some are probably in the area immediately south of Lake 
Tiberias along the Jordan River. Observers of the UN truce 
supervisory organization on 3 November reported seeing a 
truckload of Syrian troops in the Nablus area in West Jordan. 
Arrival of Syrian troops on the west bank of the Jordan River 
would probably be regarded by the Israelis as a severe provo-
cation. 
Elements of Iraq's 1st Division, which 
had been concentrated in the vicinity of H-3 pumping station 
40 miles east of the Jordan border, entered Jordan on the 
night of 3 November. One brigade of this division will re-
portedly take up positions in the vicinity of Mafraq and Salt, 
north and west of Amman, in east Jordan. Two Iraqi air 
force squadrons, one of Sea Fury piston attack aircraft and 
possibly one of Vampire jet fighters, may accompany the move. 
Following the redeployment of British 
forces from the Aqaba area, Jordan requested the entry of .a

seizure of Aqaba. 
Saudi forces in the Gulf of Aqaba area have been reinforced 
and that a Saudi force may enter Jordan shortly. After be-
ing cut off by the Israeli drive across Sinai, Egyptian forces 
stationed at the entrance to the gulf escaped across the straits 
to join the Saudi garrison. Israel has, meanwhile, informed 
the United States that it has reliable information that Egypt 
has transferred 20 IL-28 jet bombers and an unknown number 
of MIG-15 jet fighters to Saudi Arabia, where Israel fears 
they are regrouping  for an attack. 
13 Egyptian aircraft had arrived at Saudi 
airfields on the previous day, and the American embassy in 
Jidda reported the arrival and departure of five IL-28 jet 
bombers.

4. SABOTAGE OF MIDDLE EAST OIL FACE 
Egyptian agents have sabotaged the 
Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC) pipe-
lines which run from Kirkuk to the 
Mediterranean, and possibly the Amer-
ican-owned Tapline Company pipeline 
from Saudi Arabia. Ambassador 
Moose in Damascus on 4 November 
reported "heavy damage or destruc-
tion" of IPC pumping stations. Syrian 
officials disclaimed knowledge of 
where the damage was done or who had 
done it. A large fire has been reported 
at the IPC terminal at Baniyas, Syria, 
and three fires have been observed at 
pumping stations. 
 IPC stopped pumping oil to the Mediter-
ranean as of 0300 on 3 November, following a Syrian cut of 
IPC communications with the pumping stations. Other IPC 
operations are reported normal. A Cairo broadcast stated there 
has been damage to Tapline, but no shutdown has been reported. 
Authorities in Beirut and Damascus 
have given the American embassies there definite assur-
ances that they are determined to do their best to protect 
the pipelines.

has stated his determination to act against sabotage, but 
said that the British were complicating his problems by their 
"militaristic displays."

Rioting was still going on in Bahrein, however, including

5, INDIAN REACTION TO THE MIDDLE EAST CRISIS 
India approves American actions to 
date in the Middle East crisis, and 
through various sources such as Vice 
President Radhakrishnan and elder 
statesman Raj agopalachari is urging 
that the United States continue to pro--
vide strong leadership.  Prime Minister Nehru reportedly 
the 
"world's two largest democracies,' 
India and the United States, must work 
LuguLliez 40 a 1, Ce3,111. Nehru is also reportedly considering 
a trip to New York to address the UN General Assembly. 
Nehru is apparently more disturbed 
than he was after the Korean invasion in 1950, and seems 
inclined to take firmer action than he did at that time. 
Radhakrishnan told the American consul general in Madras 
that he felt India would be willing to guarantee Israeli terri-
torial integrity as part of a package deal involving removal 
of British, French, and Israeli troops from Egypt. He said 
that the United States should spearhead a UN force to occupy 
the Suez area and that he was confident India would be will-
ing to participate in such a force, Rajagopalachari echoed 
these views. 
India's affirmative vote for the Cana-
dian "police force" resolution passed by the UN General 
Assembly on 4 November bears out Ratthakrishnan's re-
marks, and a subsequent press report names India among 
five nations tentatively offering men. In view of events in 
Hungary on 4 November, India is unlikely to support the 
use of Soviet troops for this purpose. 
The Indian government is reportedly 
considering withdrawal from the Commonwealth, apparently

initially with the idea of using this as a threat against 
Britain. The matter may be discussed at a Colombo pow-
ers premiers' meeting, announced on 3 November as 
scheduled to be held in New Delhi shortly. Pakistan might 
join India in threatening to withdraw since, according to 
Prime Minister Suhrawardy, sentiment from the cabinet 
on down favors severing Pakistan's tie with the Common-
wealth. 
India has announced that it does not 
consider a meeting of the Bandung powers, so t b the 
USSR and Indonesia, as desirable at this time.

6. PEIPING'S PROTEST AGAINST BRITISH AND FRENCH 
"WANTON AGGRESSION" 
Peiping's official protest of 3 November 
over the "wanton aggression" of Britain 
and France against Egypt concludes with 
the warning that persistence in this 
course will entail "inestimably grave 
consequences." 
Previous statements had suggested that 
Chinese Communist leaders were considering what action 
they might take in the Suez crisis in order to increase the 
bloc's influence in the Asian-African countries. The Anglo-
French action creates an opportunity for Peiping to threaten 
retaliation against Hong Kong in order to bring pressure to 
bear on the British. 
There have been indications of increases 
in Chinese Communist ground force strength near Hong 
Kong in recent weeks. Some 65,000 Chinese troops are 
within 50 miles of Hong Kong, which could probably not be 
held long by British forces alone. There are approximately 
14,000 troops in Hong Kong. 
Peiping's various statements about Egypt 
have been similar to but not so violent in tone as its pro-
nouncements prior to intervention in Korea in autumn 1950. 
Further and stronger denunciations of the British would 
probably precede an attack on Hong Kong

7. REACTIONS TO SUEZ POLICY IN BRITISH AND 
FRENCH PARLIAMENT'S 
The resignation of Anthony Nutting, a 
protege of Prime Minister Eden, as 
minister of state in the Foreign Office--
announced on 4 November--provides a 
potential rallying point for any spread 
of Conservative disaffection with Prime 
Minister Eden's Middle East policies. 
Nutting, however, does not have a large 
personal following, and most other Con-
servatives with misgivings have so far 
refrained from expressing them publicly. 
The American embassy estimated on 
2 November that although some 30 Conservative members, 
of Parliament are distressed at the government's actions, 
Eden will continue to command a majority provided Britain's 
military intervention in Egypt is short and decisive. The 
government's margin in the vote of confidence on 1 Novem-
ber was 59. 
In France, too, there is a strong feeling 
that speed is essential. Premier Mollet still has the solid 
support of all non-Communist elements for his Suez policy, 
but worry over the possible repercussions in North Africa 
continues. 
The non-Communist press continues to 
back Mollet, but some editors have indicated privately their 
concern over the government's policy. Embassy contacts in the 
working level of the Foreign Ministry have expressed strong 
disapproval of Mollet's action, and some Socialist leaders, 
though withholding their criticism, are known to be opposed.

8. SOVIET MERCHANT SHIPS ORDERED OUT OF 
SUEZ AREA 
Comment The USSR is obviously seeking to avoid 
direct involvement of Soviet-flag ships 
in hostilities. At least one of these ships was probably car-
rying arms. 
As of 3 November, six other Soviet 
merchant vessels were in the Red Sea, apparently lying to 
and awaiting additional instructions. In the Mediterranean, 
two Soviet tankers were last noted lying off Port Said with 
a canal convoy.

9. SUBMARINE DESTINED FOR EGYPT RETURNING 
TO POLAND 
 the Polish submarine M-1Oi�dIth 
Polish merchant ship escort reversed 
course on 1 November after passing through 
the Straits of Gibraltar en route to Egypt. 
These vessels had left the Mediterranean 
by 2 November, presumably to return to 
Polish naval headquarters at Gdynia. 
The M-107. a Soviet-built coastal sub-
marine, left the Baltic and apparently was the 
first of two submarines scheduled for delivery to Egypt under 
the Soviet-Egyptian arms deal. It is apparently manned by 
Soviet and Polish crewmen. 
it was impossible 
for the USSR to deliver further aid to Egypt at present be-
cause of the Anglo-French air-sea blockade.

10. INDONESIAN ARMY AND POLICE CONSIDERING 
MILITARY DICTATORSHIP 
 Indonesian 
 army leaders and the chiei o 
police have agreed that the only way 
 out of the country's "present unhealthy 
situation" is to have a military dictatorship. They have not 
decided whether the junta should use President Sukarno and 
Vice President Hatta for a front. 
Army and police circles believe Sukarno 
wants to set himself up as a dictator, a development they 
oppose. They also believe  all parties except the Commu-
nist party would oppose it. 
Comment Certain top Indonesian army leaders, 
angered at corruption in the govern-
ment, have been considering a coup for several months. 
This is the first report that the police force is involved in 
the plotting. 
Following his return from China re-
cently, Sukarno suggested the abolition of all political par-
ties and indicated he would like to assume a role like that 
of Mao Tse-tung or Tito.
