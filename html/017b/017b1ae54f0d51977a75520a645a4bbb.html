 Key Judgments          President Kim I1-song has ruled North Korea since 1945, and his inevitable
 passing will introduce major uncertainty into the Korean scene. To
 minimize that uncertainty, he intends for his eldest son, Kim Chong-il, to
 succeed him.
 Kim Chong-il, at age 40, is exercising increasing control over day-to-day
 affairs, especially in domestic political and economic matters. The father-
 to-son succession has no precedent in the Communist world, but special
 circumstances in North Korea make the succession likely. Indeed, the
 image of father and son is being craftily projected in an effort to make the
 eventual transfer of power appear both natural and ordained.
 The deliberate manner in which the son is being groomed indicates that an
 early succession is not anticipated. Kim I1-song, who will be 70 in April,
 continues to be very active and retains ultimate authority over the
 decisionmaking process. While the Soviets and Chinese have avoided
 endorsing the succession scheme, there is no evidence that the succession
 issue has adversely affected North Korean foreign policy.
 Kim Chong-il's accession to power is by no means assured, however. While
 we have not been able to observe any active opposition, other senior North
 Korean leaders presumably have ambitions and may view the son as an up-
 start. Kim Chong-il's position would be uncertain if Kim 11-song died or
 was incapacitated before the son solidified his alliances within the critical
 military and security services.
 Over the years Kim 11-song, by dint of one-man rule and a pervasive
 personality cult, has kept North Korean resources almost totally mobilized
 toward the goal of a reunified Korea under P'yongyang's control. A North
 Korean regime headed by anyone other than Kim Chong-il probably would
 be less reluctant to begin dismantling the elder Kim's cult and his policies.
 A prolonged and debilitating succession struggle, in particular, would
 seriously dilute P'yongyang's ability to sustain the reunification drive and
 the strict, authoritarian controls that have reinforced Kim 11-song's long
 reign. This worrisome prospect may explain in large part the great effort
 Kim 11-song has undertaken to ensure an orderly transfer of power to his
 son.

 Because the son's claim to legitimacy is closely tied to loyalty to his father's
 vision, a regime led by Kim Chong-il would be likely to present a large
 measure of continuity characterized by:
 ? Hostility toward South Korea and the United States.
 ? Strong commitment to reunification on P'yongyang's terms.
 ? Military strength at the expense of social and economic development.
 ? Stress on self-reliance (chuche).
 We know little about Kim Chong-il's personal traits. In view of his youth
 and lack of experience he may be prone to act impulsively when, for
 example, he is faced with a shooting incident along the Demilitarized Zone.
 Kim Chong-il, in any event, could not automatically wield the absolute
 power his father has, and this would reduce his own freedom of action in
 forging North Korea's foreign and domestic policy.

 The Son Goes Public
 The problems that North Korea's tightly closed soci-
 ety present to the intelligence analyst are nowhere
 better illustrated than in Kim 11-song's nearly 10-
 year, behind-the-scenes campaign to groom his eldest
 son as his successor. During that campaign the son,
 Kim Chong-il, was never identified at public gather-
 ings, the media did not mention his name, and he did
 not meet with foreigners.
 The regime nonetheless kept the North Korean popu-
 lace apprised of the younger Kim's activities by the
 use of special honorific expressions. The most promi-
 nent codeword for the son was-and still is-the
 "party center." Through local indoctrination sessions,
 the people were made to understand that these
 codewords were, in fact, describing the son's
 activities.
 Kim 11-song, we judge, saw a number of advantages in
 keeping the succession scheme under wraps:
 ? It provided an opportunity for the son to be tested,
 while keeping the elder Kim's options open if the son
 failed to measure up.
 ? It enabled Kim 11-song to avoid lameduck status.
 ? It shielded North Korea from possibly embarrassing
 foreign commentary.
 The regime used the Sixth Congress of the Korean
 Workers Party-North Korea's ruling Communist
 party-to introduce Kim Chong-il officially to the
 rest of the world. At the congress, held in October
 1980, Kim Chong-il was named fourth-ranking mem-
 ber of the party's 19-member Political Bureau. His
 name had never before appeared in a public leader-
 ship listing. As one of the top five in the party
 hierarchy, Kim Chong-il became a member of the
 newly instituted "Presidium" or standing committee
 of the Political Bureau.
 He was also designated a secretary on the party's
 Secretariat, ranking behind only his father, who is the
 "General Secretary." As the ranking secretary, Kim
 Chong-il is now charged with the day-to-day political

 work of the party. He also was appointed a member of
 the party's prestigious Military Committee, ranking
 after his father and Defense Minister 0 Chin-u. The
 younger Kim is the only official other than his father
 to serve on both the Secretariat and the Military
 Committee.
 The party congress stopped short of formally desig-
 nating Kim Chong-il as successor to his father. Even
 so, Kim 11-song's decision to "go public" with his son
 and, by extension, the succession scheme was not
 taken lightly. As long as the son remained behind the

 scenes it was possible for the elder Kim to abandon
 the scheme, as in the early 1970s he had abandoned a
 similar effort to groom his own younger brother, Kim
 Yong-chu.
 Heightened Profile
 Since the party congress, the buildup of Kim Chong-if
 has intensified. Early in 1981, P'yongyang began to
 encourage foreigners to offer toasts to Kim Chong-il's
 health at diplomatic functions. By late spring, North
 Korea began publicizing these greetings as well as
 longer stories and commentaries hailing the son's
 exploits. In some cases P'yongyang has attributed to
 foreigners favorable comments on Kim Chong-il,
 when in fact no such comments were made.
 In May 1981, North Korea started selectively publi-
 cizing Kim Chong-il's activities in the official media,
 focusing on his duties in domestic political and eco-
 nomic affairs. Kim Chong-il's appearances at about
 10 functions in 1981 served to keep him in the
 limelight, but the attention paid to him does not begin
 to rival that given to his father, whose appearances
 were publicized on at least 130 occasions during 1981.
 North Korean newspapers now treat Kim Chong-il
 more extensively than they do any other leader with
 the exception of Kim 11-song. In the party daily:
 ? Articles on Kim Chong-il appear on page 1 in the
 lead position on the upper right-hand side.
 ? Kim Chong-il's name is printed in boldface type.
 ? The sizes of the headline and the type font have
 increased, although they are still somewhat smaller
 than those used for Kim 11-song.
 The major duties that Kim Chong-il is now openly
 performing closely parallel those attributed to the
 "party center" before the party congress. He is
 charged with ensuring that party members remain
 loyal to Kim II-song, a task that is enshrined in the
 slogan "dyeing the whole of society" with Kim II-
 song's thoughts. His role as chief interpreter, protec-
 tor, and propagandizer of Kim 11-song's thoughts not
 only provides the younger Kim with a potent political
 weapon against would-be challengers, but also but-
 tresses his supporters' claim that he is the logical
 choice to carry on his father's achievements.

 and December newspapers.
 Heightened emphasis on Kim Chong-il in the party daily Nodong Sinmun is seen in the gradually in-
 creasing size of type used in headlines about     Chong-il's guidance activities in the June, August,
 25X1
 Approved For Release 2007/02/12 : CIA-RDP83B00227R000100080006-5
 Kim Chong-il appears deeply involved in both formu-
 lating and supervising the implementation of North
 Korea's economic policies and plans. One of his more
 publicized contributions is the so-called speed bat-
 tle-mobilizing all available manpower and resources
 to achieve a specific goal in a relatively short time.
 The concept is patterned after the Chollima, or
 winged-horse, campaign-a labor-intensive produc-
 tion campaign Kim 11-song instituted in the late
 1950s. The two techniques have been coupled in a
 single slogan-the "spirit of Chollima spurred on by
 the speed campaign." This slogan elevates the son's
 contribution in directing the national economy to the
 same level as that of his father.
 Perhaps Kim Chong-il's most celebrated innovation is
 the "three-revolution team" movement, a nationwide
 campaign initiated in 1973. Such teams, made up of
 technicians, students, and representatives from the
 party, are sent to factories and farms to check on the
 performance of local party and administrative leaders.
 The teams are credited with eradicating all sorts of
 bureaucratic evils and outmoded concepts. In practi-
 cal terms, the movement provides the younger Kim
 with a separate and powerful institutional arm to
 purge or demote veteran functionaries and replace
 them with handpicked representatives.
 A Long Apprenticeship
 North Korea, through its official press, clearly is
 attempting to portray Kim Chong-il's activities in a
 manner that evokes the image of his father's activities
 over the past years. Kim Chong-il, for example, is now
 shown making periodic inspection trips in the prov-
 inces, accompanied by other senior North Korean
 leaders. He also is shown inspecting the progress on
 construction projects in P'yongyang. The younger
 Kim is credited with the decade-long campaign to
 modernize and beautify the capital city-the results
 of which have impressed even the harshest foreign
 critics of the North Korean regime.
 The activities that the son has not engaged in are just
 as important, however, in gauging the overall pace of
 the succession:
 ? He has yet to make a publicized speech or publish
 an article under his own name.
 A youthful Kim Chong-il looks on respectfully as his fat her visits a
 "three revolution" exhibit, probably in the early 1970s. Photos
 such as this one are appearing in current North Korean publica-
 tions with increasing frequency as part of the effort to link the
 younger Kim historically with the achievements of his fat her.I   2X1
 ? He has not presided over a major national event.
 ? He has not met with foreign leaders.
 ? He has not traveled abroad in his capacity as a high-
 ranking official.
 This pattern of activity suggests that the elder Kim is
 still moving at a deliberate pace on the succession
 scheme. In any event, the succession issue dominates
 North Korean domestic policy concerns. At every
 major domestic function the party sponsors, the publi-
 cized proceedings are focused almost exclusively on
 the campaign to ensure that party functionaries ac-
 cept Kim Chong-il's instructions without fail.
 The one development that obviously could cause the
 succession scenario to quicken would be a sudden
 deterioration in Kim 11-song's health. The elder Kim,
 who will be 70 in April, is overweight, a heavy
 smoker, and probably has high blood pressure. He has
 a large growth on the back of his neck, which is not
 life threatening but is too complex to remove for
 purely cosmetic reasons. In the past year or so North
 Approved For Release 2007/02/12 : CIA-RDP83B00227R000100080006-5
 Confidential
 Korea has permitted this growth, which is visible at
 the hairline from the left side, to appear in official
 photographs, a reminder of the elder Kim's mortality.
 This new candor reinforces the need for addressing
 the succession issue.
 Kim 11-song nonetheless shows no sign of slowing
 down any time soon. He has remained extremely
 active since the party congress and has no hesitancy
 about meeting in long sessions with foreign visitors. In
 April, Kim 11-song will be receiving numerous foreign
 leaders who have been urged to attend gala celebra-
 tions marking his 70th birthday. Preparations for this
 demanding schedule would not be proceeding if Kim
 11-song's health were questionable.
 Foreign Reactions
 Thus far, China and the USSR, P'yongyang's treaty
 allies, have avoided public commentary on Kim
 Chong-il. Among "fraternal" Communist countries,
 the issue of succession has long been viewed as an
 internal matter. North Korea, in developing its ration-
 ale for a planned succession, has not endeared itself to
 Beijing or Moscow, however. In thinly veiled terms,
 P'yongyang has argued that its method will help avoid
 the chaos that followed the deaths of Stalin and Mao.
 China, for reasons of political expediency, would
 probably be more inclined than the Soviet Union to
 tolerate a family succession. Beijing, wants to keep
 P'yongyang firmly in its camp and over the years has
 been willing to overlook Kim 11-song's cult. Beijing
 will find it difficult to accede to North Korean
 pressure for explicit endorsement of the succession,
 however, because of domestic Chinese political sensi-
 tivities. China's present top leaders used criticism of
 the personality cult of Mao Zedong and his successor
 Hua Guofeng to remove the latter from the party
 chairmanship in 1981.
 China's desire to skirt the succession issue came to the
 fore during the visit of Premier Zhao Ziyang in
 December 1981. Not only did Zhao fail to acknowl-
 edge Kim Chong-il, but the North Korean hosts
 themselves refrained from making any mention of the
 son in connection with Zhao's five-day stay in North
 Korea. The omission was made all the more striking
 by a publicized appearance by the son at a separate
 event in P'yongyang during Zhao's visit.
 The Soviets, for their part, are extremely distrustful
 of Kim 11-song and have been unwilling to endorse
 Kim's cult. They have not forgotten Kim's ingratitude
 for past assistance and his penchant for taking high-
 risk actions that jeopardize Soviet strategic interests.
 Moscow probably does not cherish the prospect of
 trying to cope with the younger Kim, who could be as
 irascible and unpredictable as his father.
 Kim Chong-il's Assets
 Historically, Communist states have had great diffi-
 culty arranging an orderly transfer of power. More-
 over, Kim 11-song's father-son succession scheme has
 no precedent in the Communist world. Thus, by most
 standards, Kim Chong-il would seem to have more
 going against him than for him.
 There are, however, some special conditions at work
 in North Korea that improve the son's chances. First,
 of course, is Kim It-song's great personal power.
 Many of his senior lieutenants may be unenthusiastic
 about the younger Kim, but they are undoubtedly
 loyal to Kim 11-song-he has systematically eliminat-
 ed his opponents over the years. Thus, resistance, if
 any, is likely to remain passive as long as the senior
 Kim is around.
 There are no obvious challengers to Kim Chong-il.
 The older Kim's personal involvement in virtually
 every aspect of North Korea's development has cre-
 ated an enormous gap between Kim 11-song and his
 immediate subordinates. Only party veteran Kim Il
 has anything approaching an independent stature, and
 his health is poor.
 Finally, North Korea is probably more of a closed
 society than any other country in the world. A
 generation has matured under virtually exclusive in-
 doctrination in Kim 11-song's thought. To the people,
 Kim 11-song is both a political leader and a father
 figure. North Korean propaganda has sought to cap-
 italize on and magnify this personal appeal in order to
 establish the legitimacy of the son's claim. Indeed, the
 image of the father and the son is being craftily
 projected in an effort to make the eventual transfer of
 power appear both natural and foreordained.

 The Murky Background
 of Kim Chong-il
 Despite his heightened publicity, reliable information
 on Kim Chong-il's personal history remains meager.
 He was born on 16 February 1942, a date that
 P'yongyangfinally cormed on his 40th birthday.
 There is still uncertainty concerning where he was
 born.
 Most accounts suggest that Kim Il-song took refuge
 in the Soviet Union after Japanese forces moved
 against Korean Communist guerrillas in Manchuria
 in the late 1930s. North Korean hagiographers, how-
 ever, put guerrilla leader Kim in the Korea-Manchu-
 ria border area. The issue has implications for the
 younger Kim. As successor, it is important that his
 birthplace be established on Korean soil or in terri-
 tory under the operational control of Kim II-song's
 partisan forces.
 Kim Chong-il's early family life is also obscure. His
 mother, Kim Chong-suk, died in 1949 at the age of
 32. Since the mid-1970s, a campaign has been under
 way to depict her as a fervent follower of Kim II-song
 and a staunch revolutionary in her own right. This
 program is also meant to lend support to Kim Chong-
 il's cause.
 Kim II-song remarried in the early 1950s. His second
 wife, Kim Song-ae, is a member of the party Central
 Committee and leader of the women's league. During
 her infrequent public appearances, she is identified as
 Kim Il-song's wife. Kim Il-song reportedly has a son
 and daughter by this second marriage, but neither
 has been mentioned by name in the press.I
 Kim Chong-il reportedly studied briefly in Eastern
 Europe and ultimately graduated from Kim II-song
 University in P'yongyang. He apparently did not serve
 in the armed forces but moved directly into an
 important post in the central party apparatus. Kim
 Chong-il reportedly has a wife and children, but they
 have never been mentioned in the North Korean
 media.
