 INTELLIGENCE MEMORANDUM
 CTUNA:  AGRICULTURE IN 1971 AND PROSPECTS FOR 1972
 Conclusions
 1.   In spite of poor weather, grain production in the People's
 Republic of China (PRC) in 1971 probably equaled 1970's record harvest
 of 215 million to 220 million metric tons. Improvements in, the management
 of water resources and further increases in chemical fertilizer and agricultural
 equipment offset the effects of floods, droughts, and insect infestations.
 2.   Agricultural production in 1972 probably will exceed production
 in 1971 by a good margin simply because of the continued rapid increase
 in industrial inputs into agriculture. Moreover, the margin could be raised
 substantially if weather proves better than average. Finally, the Chinese may
 be entering a period when their investment in water control measures will
 begin to pay off handsomely.
 3.  In the first half of 1972, Peking has reaffirmed its pragmatic
 policies toward agriculture, notably its permissive attitude toward private
 plots, traditional handicrafts, and petty trade. Within the commune, the
 production brigade and the production team retain their power to decide
 on day-to-day  details.  Further  evidence  of  the  regime's  tacit
 acknowledgement of the importance of incentives is a series of recent price
 c,cts in industrial inputs coupled with increases in agricultural procurement
 prices.
 4.  Starting in 1961, the PRC has imported 4 million to 5 million
 tons of wheat each year to feed cities in the northeast and, incidentally,
 to reduce the strains in the domestic procurement system. In 1971, imports
 were cut to 3.1 million tons, partly because of the need to reduce trade
 unbalances and partly because of an unwarranted anticipation of a sizable

 increase in grain production. Now in 1972, Peking has signed a new contract
 with Canada to bring imports back up to more normal levels.
 5.   China's main agricultural policies at mid-1972 are appropriate to
 its general economic strategy of vigorous military-industrial expansion
 combined with reasonable prov'3ion for the population.The well-entrenched
 policy of supplying increasing industrial inputs for agriculture and the
 moderat,,- approach to agricultural organization and incentives should result
 in enough food and clothing to meet the basic needs of a rapidly growing
 population during the remainder of the Fourth Five-Year Plan period
 (1971-75). At the same time, no dramatic technological breakthrough is
 in the offing nor will agriculture generate large new quantities of export
 goods.
 6.   The long-term economic strategy of the PRC has focused on the
 rapid expansion of military-industrial strength. Fundamental to this strategy
 has been austerity iii consumption and a comparatively low priority for
 agriculture. Originally, Chairman Mao Tse-Tung and his associates believed
 that, collectivization and socialist incentives were most of what was required
 for agriculture to meet its goals. The disaster years of 1959-61 dispelled
 thin belief, and beginning in 1962, Peking began to inject resources into
 agriculture  in ever-increasing volume. This turnabout in policy helped
 overcome the immediate food crisis and enabled the agricultural sector to
 expand in line with China's population over the past decade.
 7.    This memorandum  first  describes  the performance of the
 agricultural sector in 1971. It examines weather conuitions, the availability
 of inputs, and agricultural policy. The memorandum then reviews the results
 of agricul' aral performance on food consumption and on grain imports.
 Next, agricultural prospects for 1972 and the remainder of the Fourth
 Five-Year Plan are examined. The Appendix gives a breakdown, by province,
 of official claims for grain production in 1970-71
 Agricultural Perf:)rmance in 1971
 8.  Agricultural  performance  in  the  PRC  in  1971  was  a
 disappointment to the regime. Although Peking initially claimed that grain

 production exceeded production in 1970, the regime has since backed off
 from this claim. Production of most industrial crops and soybeans
 apparently fell short of production in 1970. According to an official
 announcement in December 1971, hog numbers increased by 14% - the
 most optimistic percentage production claim. Even this claim was revised
 downward to 11% in March 1972 The Chinese press has singled out poor
 weather as the main problem in agriculture in 1971. Independent
 information on growing conditions confirms that agriculture indeed suffered
 from widespread floods and droughts as well as abnormally high rates of
 insect infestation.
 Grain Production
 9.  In late 1970, Premier Chou En-lai told the American writer Edgar
 Snow that grain production in 1970 was more than 240 million tons. At
 year-end 1971, the Chinese press reported a new record crop of 246 million
 tons. However, subsequent down-grading of provincial claims and the failure
 of the regime to repeat this national claim suggest that the initial claim
 was a preliminary estimate.
 10.   As Chou himself has frankly conceded, the Chinese statistical
 apparatus has serious gaps in its coverage of the economy. The series for
 grain production used in this memorandum puts production in 1971 at
 the same level as in 1970 - 215 million to 220 million tons (see Table 1).
 The beneficial effects in 1971 of larger amounts of chemical fertilizers and
 improved water management were offset by extensive poor weather. The
 grain area affected by serious drought, water-logging, windstorms, and insect
 pests was said by the Chinese press to have been three times as large as
 in 1970.
 The Spring Harvest
 11.   The spring harvest normally accounts for about one-third of the
 annual harvest of grain, the fall harvest for the remainder. The spring harvest
 of 1971 exceeded the good spring harvest of 1970. Most of the increase
 stemmed from an increase in early rice output in the south, which is
 normally one-half of the spring harvest and which be_iefited from a 20%
 increase in acreage. But for this acreage increase, the early rice output would
 not have been as good as the excellent harvest of 1970. Early rice production
 in Kiangsu, Hupeh, Szechwan, Fukien, Hunan, and Anhwei was said to have
 increased by 20%; these provinces also reported the largest increases in early
 rice acreage. However, these provinces normally account for only about
 one-third of the total early rice acreage. Most of the remaining early rice
 provinces - Chekiang, Kiangsi, Kwangtung, and Kwangsi - reported little

 or no increase over 1970. Drought lowered the early rice output in South
 China - particularly in Kwangtung, which accounts for about.20% of the
 early rice acreage.
 12.   Early harvested crops in the north - primarily winter wheat -
 did not do as well as the mediocre 1970 crops. Below average precipitation
 in the winter and spring over the major winter wheat region retarded plant
 growth, and heavy rains in June caused high harvest losses. In sum, a good
 early rice crop outweighed a mediocre harvest of winter wheat; giving the
 regime a small margin above the good spring harvest of 1970.
 The Fall Harvest
 13.   The Chinese made no overall claims for the 1971 fall harvest
 except to note that it was affected by serious drought and waterlogging.
 Only Shansi Province was cited by the Chinese as having a better fall harvest
 than in 1970. In 1970, China's fall harvest was excellent in the north but
 only average in the south.
 14..  During the month of June 1971, extensive rain fell on the entire
 North China Plain. The extent of this rainfall is shown on the map, Figure 1.
 Although this rainfall did not lead to widespread flooding, it was sufficient
 to cause local flooding and extensive waterlogging. The lack of information
 from either Chinese or independent sources makes it difficult to judge the
 severity of this waterlogging and its effect on crop yields. However, a
 comparison of provincial year-end statements with statements made at the
 time of the harvest suggests that the fall harvest was probably less than
 in 1970.

 Above Normal Rainfall, June 1971
 15.   In July, widespread drought hit Eastern, Central, and Southwest
 China as well as Fukien Province in South China. This drought area is shown
 on the map, Figure 2.                               interruptions to
 planting schedules in areas with inadequate water conservation. Many of
 the crops, weakened by drought, succumbed to insect damage. In addition,
 the expansion- of the early rice acreage had been at the expense of
 intermediate rice and may also have resulted in a reduced acreage of fall
 harvested rice. As a consequence of the drought and a possible decline in
 fall rice acreage, the harvest of late rice was at best. only equal to the
 output of 1970.
 16.   The only other important fall harvest area is in Northeast China.
 No harvest statement was issued for Liaoning. The harvest was reported
 to have been "fairly good" and "good" in Kirin and Heilungkiang Provinces,
 respectively. These signal words mean the harvest was below average in the

 Northeast. Insect pests and unfavorable weather - windstorms, drought,
 waterlogging, and hailstorms - appear to have been responsible for the
 lackluster performance.
 17.  In short, the fall harvest of grains was not quite up to the fall
 harvest of 1970. Grain production for 1971 as a whole is estimated as
 approximately the same as in 1970, with the spring harvest slightly ahead
 and the fall harvest slightly behind.
 Industrial Crops and Soybeans
 l8.  The performance of industrial crops in 1971 was unimpressive.
 Only sesame and rapeseeds, tea, and silkworm cocoons did better than in
 1970. The other industrial crops - cotton , other fiber crops, tobacco, sugar,
 and the other oil seed crops - fell behind those of 1970. The dearth of

 CONFIDENTIAL
 information published on the acreage planted to these crops and the
 indications of expansion in food crop acreage in 1971 suggest that the area
 sown to industrial crops may have decreased.
 Soybeans
 19.  Soybeans - traditionally one of China's leading crops - have not
 received much attention in the Chinese press in recent years. In 1970,
 weather conditions were exceptionally good in Northeast China, where more
 than 40% of China's soybeans are produced. In contrast, in 1971, the
 weather in his area was quite poor. Increases in soybean production in
 the other producing areas were not sufficient to offset the decline in
 production in the Northeast.
 20.   The tight soybean situation has been reflected in a marked
 decrease in soybean exports to Japav, the PRC's principal soybean customer;
 see the following tabulation (in thousand tons):
 Year     Exports
 1968        417
 1969        377
 1970        291
 1971        283
 The Japanese; hoped to import at least 250,000 tons in 1972; the Chinese
 have madc? available less than 100,000 tons.
 Cotton
 21.   Cotton production fell from 1.7 million tons in 1970 to 1.6
 million tons in 1971 because of unfavorable weather and, probably, a decline
 in acreage. Drought conditions in July in Central and East China and heavy
 rains during the last ten days of June in North China seriously damaged
 the crop. Substantial increases, in production in Shensi (20% over 1970)
 and in Szechwan (18% over 1970) almost certainly were insufficient to
 make up for the deficit.
 Sugar Crops
 22.  Output of, both sugar beets and sugar cane was lower in 1971
 than in 1970. In. Heilungkiang, China's major sugar beet area, drought
 damaged the sugar beet crop. In Kwangtung, which accounts for more than
 40% of China's sugar cane acreage, a series of typhoons caused severe lasses.
 Only Szechwan - China's second most important source of sugar cane -
 claimed a substantial increase in sugar cane production of 25% above that
 of 1970.

 Factors Affecting 1971 Performance
 23.   Whereas weather was a negative factor in the agricultural picture
 in 1971, technological inputs - such as chemical fertilizers, improved water
 control, and increased mechanization - were offsetting factors on the
 positive side.
 24.   The supply of chemical fertilizers available to agriculture has
 increased every year since 1961 (see Table 2). Although imports of chemical
 fertilizers remained unchanged in 1971 compared with 1970, domestic
 output reportedly increased by 30%. Most of this increase came from the
 growir,,,- number of small and medium-size plants that came into production
 in 1 971. Because there was no increase in imports, the overall increase in
 chemical fertilizer availabilities in 1971 (when measured in nutrient content)
 was only about I S% over 1970. This was a smaller percentage increase than
 the 20% increase in nutrient content in 1970 but was still substantial.
 25.   To reap the greatest advantage from present and future increases
 in chemical fertilizers, high-yielding farmlands with dependable systems of
 water supply and water control are essential. Because natural conditions
 in China are highly variable, the improvement of water management has
 been singularly difficult, particularly in the large and poorly drained areas
 of the North China Plain.* Earlier attempts at water conservation during
 the Great Leap Forward (1958-60) were of little or no value. In 1970 and
 1971, plans that are more rational - involving smaller projects - have been
 emphasized. The claims for these projects have been reserved compared with
 claims during the Leap Forward. In 1971, for example, the Chinese claimed
 that 1.8 million hectares - about 2% of the total cultivated land - were
 added to high yield farmland. Although the small size of these projects
 suggests that they may not be effective under extreme weather conditions,
 they undoubtedly are.adding to the capacity of China's agricultural sector.
 26.   The mechanization of Chinese agriculture is slowly proceeding
 from a narrow base. Sources of energy for agricultural use - electric power
 and petroleum - have expanded in concert with the increased inventory
 of agricultural machinery. In 1971 the Chinese claimed that the total value
 of farm machinery production was 21% above that of 1970 and that the
 production of tractors, walking tractors, internal combustion engines, and
 rice-transplanters topped previous annual records. The use of additional
 machinery during peak harvest periods when the labor supply sometin,. s
 becomes a critical element has erabled the Chinese to gather crops in more
 timely fashion and to reduce harvest losses. In some cases, the use of
 machinery ha.. enabled the Chinese to increase the effectiveness of their

 limited land resources through the introduction of more intensive cropping
 patterns. In still other cases, machinery has relieved some of the most
 burdensome physical toil of the countryside -- the observer- often can see
 one bulldozer and hundreds of basket carriers on rural construction projects.
 In summary, even though the PRC would be ill-advised to substitute
 machinery for (the abundant) manpower on a wide scale, the gradual
 increase in rural mechanization can add an element of flexibility to
 productive capacity and eliminate at least a portion of the backbreaking
 tasks.
 27.   Whereas the increasing flow of inputs gives an upward slope to
 the long-term trend line, the success of agricultural production in China
 in any given year still depends heavily on weather conditions. During 1971,
 for example, poor weather offset the beneficial effects of the increased
 inputs made available during the year. Weather patterns are notoriously
 unstable over large portions of China's farmland, and the twin problems
 of too little or too much water continue to plague Chinese agriculture.
 One of the instructive features of Peking's programs for better water
 management is the potential for reducing the effects of bad weather - that
 is, reducing the size of the troughs in agricultural production.

 Agricultural Policy
 28.   The Chinese have been pursuing their new agriculture investment
 policy for a decade. The policy almost certainly is being continued as a
 key element in the Fourth Five-Year Plan, whose details are yet to be
 unveiled. The new policy is an "agriculture first" policy only under certain
 circumstances. Military-industrial expansion is the priority economic goal
 of the regime; agriculture has first call on resources only when food supply
 dips below that needed to maintain productive efficiency and popular
 morale, as happened in 1959-61. The added investment in agriculture has
 resulted in substantial increases in production of grain. Industrial crops have
 fared less well, partly because acreage had to be diverted to grain crops.
 The minimum aim for industrial crops has been to keep output up by
 increasing average yields on the reduced acreage.
 29.   The "agriculture first" policy has also a more or less stabilizing
 effect on agricultural institutions. Throughout the past decade, the
 cultivation of .private plots has been permitted and private hog raising has
 been positively encouraged. In addition, the production team - the smallest
 unit of the three-tier organizational system in rural areas - has remained
 the locus of economic decision making and control. For most of the period,
 farmers have been paid more in accordance with work done than need or
 political attitudes. These pragmatic policies - which cut against the grain
 of the more radical cadres - have contributed substantially to the increase
 in agricultural production, particularly of vegetables, meat, fish, and other
 non-grain foods. During 1971 these policies received further emphasis. Thus,
 side-line activities such as pottery-making and woodcrafts were encouraged
 as sources of supplementary income for both individuals and production
 teams. Collective units, such as communes, were urged to plow back the
 funds earned through these activities in agriculture.
 30.   Finally, during the second half of 1971, the central authorities
 chose to stimulate agricultural production further by decreasing the price
 of some technological inputs and by increasing the price paid for industrial
 crops. According to the Chinese press, the prices of chemical fertilizers and
 ins?cticides were reduced by 9.7% and 15%, respectively; kerosene and diesel
 fuel, by 20.8% and 9.7%, respectively; and various types of agricultural
 machinery, by an average of 15.7%. At the same time, the regime increased
 the price paid for sugar by 15.3% and for oil-bearing crops - peanuts,
 sesame, rapeseed - by an average of 16.7%. Little information is available
 on the specific types and grades of commodities affected. The price changes
 came too late in the year to have great effect on 1971 performance. they
 are likely to have a considerable impact on rural income in 1972 and a
 lesrsr impact on aggregate production.

 Food Consumption and Agricultural Import Patterns in 1971
 31.  The level of consumption varies widely from locality to locality
 and from occupation to occupation. Communes, production brigades, and
 production teams in the more richly endowed areas usually are better fed
 than those in the poorer areas. For example, vegetable farmers outside
 Shanghai eat better than grain farmers in northern Shensi Province. Energy
 needs, and consequently rations, vary greatly with occupation. Thus,
 workers engaged in heavy labor may received as much as 3,000 calories
 per day, whereas students may receive as little as 1,600 calories per day.
 In contrast to the urban population, the farmers consume larger amounts
 of less desirable and nutritionally deficient grains - such as kaoliang at 1
 barley - and starchy roots to meet their energy requifements. On the other
 hand, the farmers consume slightly larger amounts of nutritionally valuable
 vegetables from their private plots than do their urban counterparts who
 must purchase such commodities in retail markets.
 32.   Caloric consumption has remained fairly stable in recent years
 and did not change significantly in 1970-71 and the first half of 1972.
 This level, about 2,000 calories per person per day, is adequate to meet
 the Chinese people's minimum energy requirements. In general, the Chinesr,
 people can be said to be reasonably well fed. Although the Chinese have
 set up an efficient rationing system that prevents dangerously low food
 levels from developing, local food shortages have occurred in areas where
 weather conditions have been particularly poor. For ins', nce, the summer
 drought in Central China in 1971 was accompanied by reduced grain rations
 in that area. Even though the caloric level has not increased substantially
 in the recent decade, the last few years have witnessed a gradual
 improvement in the quality, variety, and availability of foodstuffs. This
 improvement is due to a combination of factors, especially the permissive
 attitude toward private plots and petty trade, the steady rise in supplies
 of traditional specialty foodstuffs, and steady increases in real incomes.
 Grain Imports
 33.   Over the past 18 months, Canada has been the sole foreign
 supplier of wheat to the PRC. In 1971, China imported 3.1 million tons
 of wheat, the lowest amount imported in any year in the last decade. In
 1972 the Chinese have contracted to import from 3.75 million to 4.0 million
 tons, and Peking has already arranged to import 750,000 tons in the first
 quarter of 1973.
 34.  Chinese grain imports have been used to maintain rations in
 northern cities and thus to reduce the domestic strain of procuring grain
 for grain-deficit areas. In 1970, Peking claimed that the chronically
 grain-deficit provinces of Shantung, Hopeh, and Honan - the provinces that

 normally supply much of the grain for these cities - were basically
 self-sufficient in grain output. This claim was repeated in 1971, although
 qualified as having "initially" been accomplished. These claims, when read
 between the lines, mean that the problem had been only partly solved.
 Nonetheless, the government apparently thought that imports could be
 safely reduced in 1971, particularly since the harvests were expected to
 rise above the record level of 1970. In addition, Peking was determined
 in 1971 to increase exports and to rein in imports to redress the trade
 imbalance created in 1970.
 35.    The higher wheat imports of 1972 may be the result of several
 factors:
 A lower than expected harvest in 1971.
 Acreage shifts. The regimes's decision in late 1971 to
 increase the price paid to farmers for some industrial crops
 and the prominence given to increasing industrial crop
 output in 1972 may be the harbinger of a shift in acreage
 from grain crops to industrial crops.
 Changed trade outlook. PRC export performance in 1972
 has improved and the regime may have decided that grain
 imports can be increased to more normal levels.
 Consumer welfare. Increased grain imports could also be
 a reflection of the increased attention being given to
 consumer welfare in 1972. Wages are being raised for
 selected categories of workers; farmers apparently are
 getting bigger shareouts; and discussions of improvements
 in the "livelihood of the masses" are becoming more
 common in the press.
 Non-Gran Imports
 36.   The poor performance in industrial crop production in 1971 helps
 to explain the current Chinese interest in increased imports of Come of
 these products. For instance, the Chinese have resumed cotton imports from
 Mexico - after a lapse of six years and are now negotiating with Brazil for
 cotton imports. On the other hand, the recent increase in Chinese imports
 of sugar from new suppliers is probably more a reflection of the decreased
 availability of Cuban sugar than evidence of low levels of domestic sugar
 production.

 Prospects for 197 2
 37.   Preliminary indications are that the spring crops of 1972 should
 be at least average. Precipitation in most of the winter wheat gr_'wing area
 has been above normal throughout most of the growing season. Thus, winter
 wheat output should exceed the poor harvest of 1971. In the south and
 southwest, early spring drought has appeared and, to some extent, has
 delayed or prevented the transplanting of early rice. It is too soon, however,
 to judge the severity of this drought and its effect on crop production.
 38.   As for agricultural policy, in February 1972, Peking strongly
 reiterated the pragmatic policies of the past few years. Apparently, the
 regime is not going to let its priority concern with military-industrial
 expansion override the need for increased investment in agriculture. The
 price reductions for technological inputs and the higher procurement prices
 for industrial crops exemplify a concern for increased production in 1972.
 In particular, the increased prices paid for industrial crops should stimulate
 their production. In the cases of sugar cane and jute, acreage has been
 expanded, largely on marginal hillside land. The new incentives for growing
 industrial crops increase the pressure for shifting acreage from grain to
 industrial crop production. The price changes should be seen ? also as the
 means for financing the increased flow of chemical fertilizer and agricultural
 equipment currently moving into the countryside and for seeing that the
 inputs go to the most successful production units.
 39.   Individual incentives to produce also appear to be somewhat
 stronger this year than in the past. In 'addition to continued regime tolerance
 of private plot cultivation and petty trading activity, there are some
 indications that the guidelines governing distribution at harvest time have
 been loosened to give the farmer a larger return for his labor. Current press
 discussions of the workpoint system -- the basic system for 13termining
 peasant remuneration - emphasize payment according to work done and
 tend to downplay such criteria as payment determined by political attitude
 and payment according to reed.  Similarly, there are also signs that
 workpoint scales for auxiliary farm labor - women and youth - are being
 made more generous than in the past. In sum, the fundamental policy of
 "taking grain as the key link" remains in force, and, given these improved
 incentives and good weather, both gain and industrial crop production
 could increase.
 A Farther Look Ahead
 40.   In this memorandum, the past decade in agriculture has been
 characterized as a period of higher investment, pragmatic policies, and
 increased production. Ideological trumpeting, especially during the Cultural
 Revolution (1966-69), raised the specter of renewed rural radicalism, yet
 the private plots remained essentially undistributed. The present pragmatic,

 incentive-oriented policies continue to contradict Communist ideology. Thus
 a new dose of radicalization always rertiains a possibility. As of the moment,
 however, such policies as private plot cultivation, private hog raising, and
 side-line light industrial activity seem well entrenched. A revival of radicalism
 in agriculture in 1972 seems highly unlikely. The possibilities for such a
 revival will increase as the PRC moves into the mid-1970s, largciy because
 an aging leadership must soon be replaced with unpredictable results.
 41.  Assuming average weather conditions, prospects for a continuation
 of a 2% to 3% growth rate of agriculture during the next few years are
 good. The potential for further increases in chemical fertilizer and other
 industrial inputs is' excellent. The industrial facilities that     supply the
 increased inputs to agriculture over the next' few years are now being
 commissioned or are at advanc.-d stages of construction. The ability to
 extend modern water management techniques to create additional high-yield
 acreage will continue. Nonetheless, it is unlikely that grain production will
 increase dramatically in the next few years. Greater contributions from
 agriculture to overall economic development - for example, a sizable
 increase in supplies of raw materials for light industry and an expansion
 of agricultural commodities for export - are also ur.likely to be forthcoming
 in the near future. For one thing, there is a lack of emphasis on developing
 high-yield seed varieties - i necessary condition for such increases. This
 fact - plus the steadily increasing costs of developing high-yield areas -
 makes dramatic increases in agricultural production unlikely. Finally, the
 new Maoist-style system of education emphasizes the immediate and the
 practical at the expense of the future and the theoretical. A revival of
 long-term agricultural research would be a signal that Peking is alert to
 the agricultural development needs of the mid-1970s.

 Provincial Claims for Grain Production in 1970-71
 As indicated in Table 3, the 1971 grain production in 15 provinces,
 normally responsible for about three-quarters of the total annual grain
 production, exceeded 1970's output. Since the Chinese are apparently
 reluctant to report decreases in production, it is presumed that the remaining
 provinces suffered decreases in production. In 1970, in turn, 18 provinces,
 normally responsible for about 80% of the total grain production, claimed
 that production increased over 1969, and, in addition, that 12 of these
 provinces - normally responsible for about one-half of the total annual
 production - had increased grain production by 10% or more. Here again,
 it was assumed that in the remaining provinces production had been down
 over the previous year.
 Even with these assumptions, these percentage increases suggest that
 total grain production in 1970 and 1971 may have been higher than our
 estimate. However, there is reason to believe that these figures represent
 the Chinese preliminary estimates and that the final figures, for the most
 part, are apt to fall short of these estimates. Thus in 1571, seven provinces
 claimed an increase in production over the previous year without claiming
 a record despite the fact that in the precious year these provinces had
 claimed a record. This logical inconsistency strongly suggests that the 1970
 results  had  subsequently  been  revised  downward  without  public
 acknowledgement of these revised results. In a few instances, revised figures
 were published that were higher than the preliminary estimate. Thus a late
 revision of the results of the 1971 crop in Sinkiang changed the preliminary
 statement from an "all-round success" in agricultural production to a "10%
 increase in grain" production. This suggests that revised results are generally
 published only if they  are  an  improvement  over the  preliminary
 announcement.
