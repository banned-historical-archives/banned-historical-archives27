 Key Judgments
 The current Sino-Vietnamese quarrel over Hanoi's treatment of the
 ethnic Chinese population in Vietnam is the most clear manifestation to date
 of the fundamental differences between Peking and Hanoi. These differences
 center on.Hanoi's ties with Moscow and the competition for influence in
 Indochina and the rest of Southeast Asia.
 ? Peking is deeply suspicious of Vietnam's regional ambitions, and also
 its tilt toward Moscow.
 ? Hanoi resents what it sees as Peking's attempts to dominate Southeast
 Asia as well as its support to Cambodia.
 ? Cambodia is pivotal in the rift between China and Vietnam since it is
 the current focus of their rivalry for regional influence. Hanoi seems
 determined to bring a more malleable regime to power in Phnom Penh,
 while China shows no sign of willingness to soften its support of the
 current Cambodian leadership.
 ? The prospect is for continuing fighting between Cambodia and Viet-
 nam, which means that Chinese support to Phnom Penh and Soviet
 assistance to Hanoi are also likely to increase.
 ? Although both sides realize that neither is likely to benefit from an all-
 out confrontation, bitterness is . so deep that the situation could
 deteriorate further, especially if ? the .Vietnam-Cambodia fighting
 intensifies.
 ? Hanoi might eventually feel it necessary to permit a Soviet military
 presence in Vietnam, long a major concern of Peking.
 ? The relationship between Peking and Hanoi already has moved into a
 new and probably protracted stage of open political warfare and
 heightened military tensions that could threaten the new equilibrium
 that has developed in Southeast Asia since the end of the Indochina
 war in 1974.

 The Peking-Hanoi-Phnom Penh Triangle
 Introduction
 The current dispute between Hanoi and Peking over Vietnam's treat-
 ment of its ethnic Chinese population is the latest and most spectacular
 manifestation of serious Sino-Vietnamese problems that have emerged since
 the Indochina war ended in 1975. The Vietnamese decision to "nationalize"
 private trade in both the northern and southern sectors of the country in late
 March was the immediate catalyst for the current problem. The Vietnamese
 move, which affected most severely the overseas Chinese community in
 Vietnam, was characterized by Chinese Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping as the
 "11th step" against China, one which he said required Chinese "retaliation."
 Although neither side probably was prepared for the mass exodus of refugees
 from Vietnam to China that followed the implementation of nationalization,
 the adversary relationship that already. existed between Peking and Hanoi has
 made it impossible for either to make the kinds of compromises that would
 ease the tensions significantly. In fact, mutual suspicions are so acute that
 any mishandling of the refugee situatiorf'could quickly lead to a formal, open
 break between the two most powerful Communist countries in Asia.
 Background
 For centuries China has believed that it should be the primary power in
 Southeast Asia. The Vietnamese, for their part, have resented China's
 dominance and have long hoped to carve out their own sphere of influence.
 During the long Indochina war, this basic conflict was held in check by a
 common desire to reduce first French and then US influence in the region,
 and by Hanoi's great need for Chinese support.
 When the Communist governments assumed control in Vietnam, Cam-
 bodia, and Laos after the war, the wartime constraints that had muted the
 Sino-Vietnamese dispute quickly evaporated. With the greatly reduced US
 presence in the area no longer perceived as a. major threat and Hanoi no
 longer in need of military support from China, a series of difficult problems
 involving the national interests of both countries surfaced. Even before the
 fighting had ended, Hanoi and Peking were disputing ownership of islands in
 the South China Sea, principally the Paracels-which the Chinese occupied
 in 1974, and the Spratlys-portions of which are controlled by Vietnam. For
 the past three years there have also been sporadic reports of conflict-
 including small-scale firefights this year-over the land border between the
 two countries, a border that was demarcated in the 19th century.

 The issue of Soviet influence in Indochina has been a fundamental and
 perennial source of Sino-Vietnamese tensions. The Vietnamese Communists,
 who needed the support of both Moscow and Peking to gain control of all
 Vietnam, skillfully played the two Communist powers against one another
 during the war, tilting one way for a time and then the other in order to gain
 maximum advantage from both. When the war ended, the USSR was in a
 better position than China to provide the economic assistance Vietnam
 needed to reconstruct and unify the country. Moreover, as the more distant
 power, Moscow clearly represented a less direct potential threat to Vietnam
 than did China. As a result, Hanoi's relations with Moscow in the postwar
 years grew closer, just as Sino-Vietnamese tensions were increasing.
 Still, for obvious reasons, neither Hanoi nor Peking seemed to want a
 complete rupture of relations. From Peking's point of view, a break would
 push Hanoi even further toward Moscow and almost certainly result in an
 increased Soviet presence in Vietnam. Hanoi would find itself with a powerful
 antagonist on its northern border, and nearly totally dependent on Moscow
 and its East European allies for vital assistance.
 The Importance of Cambodia
 Despite the interest of both sides in holding their differences in check,
 frictions continued to mount during the postwar period. With the outbreak of
 serious fighting between Vietnam and Cambodia last December, these
 frictions became acute.
 The attitudes of China and Vietnam toward Cambodia demonstrate the
 stark conflict of interests in the region. Peking wants a sympathetic govern-
 ment in Phnom Penh that will serve both as a counter to what the Chinese see
 as Vietnamese regional ambitions and as an obstacle to the growth of the
 Soviet presence in the area. Hanoi, on the other hand, wants a Laos-type
 regime in Cambodia that will be responsive to Vietnamese direction and thus
 enhance Hanoi's aspirations for a "federation" of Indochinese states dominat-
 ed by Vietnam. Peking's deep involvement in Cambodia-especially its
 military aid to Phnom Penh since the fighting began-has been especially
 nettlesome to Hanoi. From Peking's point of view, however, the support is
 essential if Cambodia is to remain an effective counter to Hanoi.
 Peking became increasingly outspoken about its displeasure with Hanoi
 as the Vietnam-Cambodia fighting intensified early this year. Party Chair-
 man Hua Kuo-feng's criticism of "regional hegemony" at the fifth National
 Peonle's Congress in February was aimed directly at Vietnam.

 At the same time, Vietnamese frustration with Peking's continued
 support for the Cambodian regime was growing. After the Vietnam-Cambo-
 dia fighting increased, Vietnamese officials raised the level of their private
 attacks on Chinese support for the Cambodians, revealing their conviction
 that China was encouraging the Cambodians to stir up trouble on the
 Vietnam-Cambodia border. While it is extremely difficult to assess hrw much
 Peking is able to influence Cambodian policies, there is little doubt that
 Peking would not be disappointed if Cambodia-Vietnam tensions led to a
 drain on Hanoi's energies. At the outset of the Vietnam-Cambodia fighting,
 Peking adopted a relatively evenhanded public stance, calling for a Vietnam-
 ese withdrawal from Cambodia and a negotiated settlement. During the first
 four months of the year, Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister Phan Hien was
 frequently in Peking. While the talks probably covered a broad range of
 problems, the Vietnam-Cambodia dispute was discussed. The talks, however,
 seem to have broken off in late April without any resolution of the
 fundamental disagreement between the two sides.
 This growing frustration with Peking probably ended whatever misgiv-
 ings the Vietnamese had about proceeding with "nationalization" measures
 they knew would most affect Vietnam's ethnic Chinese community in both
 the North and South. Although economic considerations were the most
 important factors in the decision to "nationalize," the Vietnamese also knew
 that the planned measures would be deeply resented in Peking. Whether or
 not the Vietnamese fully anticipated the mass exodus to China that followed
 these measures, their frustration with Peking seems to have led them to
 accept the further deterioration of bilateral relations that was almost certain
 to follow implementation of the plan. In fact, as early as March Vietnamese
 officials were saying privately that there was little hope of any improvement
 in relations with Peking.
 Peking's Likely Approach
 Peking is likely to pursue a two-pronged approach toward a hostile
 Vietnam that has close links with the USSR. The Chinese probably will
 increase their support to Cambodia in an attempt to prevent Phnom Penh
 from coming under Hanoi's dominance. Besides continuing efforts to improve
 relations with other countries-especially in Southeast Asia-Peking also is
 likely to play on the already healthy fears in the area about Hanoi's and
 Moscow's intentions. The Chinese are portraying the Vietnamese as Soviet

 Approved For Release 2004/03/11 : CIA-RDP80T00634A000900050001-2
 pawns and aggressive regional "expansionists" who require united Southeast
 Asian resistance. Peking has built good relations with Thailand. Malaysia,
 and the Philippines since 1975, but it has not yet normalized ties with
 Indonesia or Singapore.
 The Chinese also seem determined to "punish" Hanoi by bringing their
 remaining leverage to bear on the Vietnamese. Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping
 told visiting Thai reporters in early June that China had watched "tolerantly"
 while Hanoi took "10 steps" against China, and had retaliated only when the
 Vietnamese took the "llth step"-the "expulsion" of Vietnam's ethnic
 Chinese. Teng added that Peking is prepared to take additional retaliatory
 measures if Hanoi does not moderate its overseas Chinese policies. Peking has
 already terminated some of its economic assistance projects and is undoubted-
 ly prepared to end others. While we do not know the precise levels or kinds of
 Chinese assistance to Vietnam, Peking clearly has less economic leverage over
 Hanoi than it had during the war. Even if Peking halted all its projects in
 Vietnam, the effect would be nettlesome but not catastrophic, since the
 USSR could make up the difference.
 The Chinese already have demanded the closure of three Vietnamese
 consulates in southern China, where a small Vietnamese minority resides.
 The move will force Hanoi to deal through Peking on virtually all its business,
 presumably including low-level trade and other essentially regional business
 that had been handled between the consulates and China's provincial
 authorities. The Chinese also have engaged in some military posturing along
 the border and in the Gulf of Tonkin. Although there has been no major troop
 buildup near Vietnam, Peking doubtless wants to remind Hanoi that it
 already has considerable military forces in the region.
 The Chinese probably will try to press Phnom Penh to adopt more
 reasonable domestic and foreign policies, especially toward neighboring
 Thailand. This may prove to be a difficult task. The same xenophobia that
 drives the Cambodians to provoke the Vietnamese appears to lie behind their
 persistent aggressiveness on the Thai border, where Cambodian attacks on
 Thai villages and police outposts occur frequently.
 Hanoi's Options
 The continuing deterioration in Sino-Vietnamese relations, coupled with
 increased Chinese support to Phnom Penh, presents Hanoi with a series of
 interrelated policy problems. Since the end of the Indochina war, Hanoi has
 seen rapid economic development as its primary national objective. Problems
 with Cambodia have diverted Vietnamese resources away from this objective.
 Furthermore, the Vietnamese realize that China has the economic leverage to
 put additional strains on the development effort. In the past, the Vietnamese
 had hoped to negotiate their differences with Phnom Penh and, if necessary,
 try to obtain Chinese cooperation in seeking an end to Cambodian provoca-
 tions. With both of these avenues blocked---at least for the time being-and
 25X1
 Approved For Release 2004/03/11 : CIA-RDP80T00634A000900050001-2
 with China and Vietnam arguing bitterly over other issues, Hanoi's options
 are limited. One fundamental decision it must make is whether to attempt to
 resolve the Cambodian matter by forcing a change in leadership in Phnom
 Penh or to try to alleviate tensions by seeking a negotiated settlement with the
 Cambodians.
 Although another limited military thrust into the border area would
 offer no guarantee of forcing Cambodia to the bargaining table and would
 again mark Hanoi as an aggressor, continuing Cambodian provocations could
 generate increasing pressure from the Vietnamese military for a punitive
 attack such as that conducted last December.
 I                         Hanoi may be pursuing another option-that
 ambo ian resistance force to fight the present Phnom Penh
 of training a Cambodian'
 regime. The chances of a Vietnam-based resistance movement developing a
 viable base of support in Cambodia seem slim at best. Although Hanoi played
 the key role during 1970-73 in developing the ragtag Khmer Communist
 insurgent movement into an effective. organization and developed close
 associations with a broad range of Khmer Communists, it is unlikely that
 many pro-Hanoi cadres have survived the widespread purges in Cambodia.
 Nonetheless, there is an outside chance that there are still some who-if given
 an opportunity-would cooperate with the Vietnamese. In any event, in view
 of the risks involved in overt military operations, Hanoi may now see the
 mounting of an increased subversive challenge to Phnom Penh as a relatively
 low-cost gamble that could in time pay off.
 We cannot rule out other, more dramatic destabilizing developments. If
 fighting flares up again, a major Vietnamese offensive, much larger than the
 intrusion last year, could conceivably lead to a rout of Cambodian military
 units and pave the way for the introduction of a pro-Vietnamese puppet
 regime in Phnom Penh. Although our extremely limited knowledge of
 political and security conditions in Cambodia suggests that the present
 Cambodian leadership remains firmly in control, an open breakdown of
 political unity in Phnom Penh and/or large-scale popular uprisings in the
 countryside might tempt Hanoi to move with whatever force necessary to
 install a friendly regime. Nonetheless, the capture of the capital would
 probably be a Pyrrhic victory, leaving the Khmer Government at large in the
 jungle to continue guerrilla warfare against long, exposed Vietnamese supply
 lines.
 US Angle
 Vietnam's deteriorating relations with China will probably increase
 Hanoi's interest in establishing diplomatic ties with the United States as an
 alternative political and a possible economic counterweight to the Soviet
 Union. The reduction and potential cessation of Chinese aid already threaten
 to push Hanoi into a more dependent and thus less flexible relationship with
 Moscow-a position Vietnam's leaders have been anxious to avoid. The need
 Approved For Release 2004/03/11 : CIA-RDP80T00634A000900050001-2
 for other sources of aid-a major consideration from the beginning in Hanoi's
 desire for diplomatic relations with the United States-undoubtedly will now
 be an even more explicit motive.
 Increased political pressure on Hanoi by Peking and Moscow may also
 produce a more flexible approach to Washington. Hanoi clearly sees intrinsic
 political value in an American presence in Vietnam. Vietnamese Deputy
 Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach has remarked that Hanoi was trying to
 stay out of a Sino-Soviet squeeze and would be better off in a tripolar world.
 Even without prior assurances of US aid, then, the Vietnamese might regard
 an American embassy in Hanoi as a useful symbol of Vietnam's basic
 independence from Moscow. Signs that China and the United States were
 moving toward full diplomatic relations would increase Hanoi's fears of
 isolation, moreover, and generate even stronger pressure for modification of
 its own conditions for normalization. There already are tentative signs that
 Hanoi may be considering dropping its demands for reparations.
 The non-Communist states of Southeast Asia have drawn some comfort
 from the open fighting between Cambodia and Vietnam. Aside from the
 deflection of Vietnamese attention and resources, the conflict provides the
 most dramatic evidence to date of a new and welcome political equilibrium in
 the region that pits the Communist states of Indochina and their Great Power
 backers against each other. Without exception, member countries of the
 Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) regard a Vietnam-
 controlled Indochina as a threat to the stability of the area. Attempts to
 implant a friendly regime in Phnom Penh would severely undermine Hanoi's
 postwar diplomatic efforts to establish an image as a nonaggressive power
 seeking peaceful relations with its neighbors. Nonetheless, there clearly is
 some sympathy for Hanoi's treatment of the overseas Chinese problem, one
 that most ASEAN countries share. Some, especially Singapore and Indone-
 sia, which have not yet established normal diplomatic relations with China,
 are wary of Peking's connections with the ethnic Chinese. In fact, Singapor-
 ean officials have expressed their concern about the possibility that China's
 handling of the ethnic Chinese problem in Vietnam indicates that Peking is
 determined to take a stronger hand in "protecting" overseas Chinese
 throughout the region.
 For Thailand, the neighbor most immediately concerned with the
 conflict and its outcome, the view is considerably more complicated. From
 Bangkok's perspective, Hanoi's military strength and its aspirations for
 regional influence make Vietnam a much more serious potential threat than
 Cambodia. The Thai, in fact, are inclined to accept the Chinese and
 Cambodian charge that Hanoi intends to establish an Indochinese "feder-
 ation." This would be the worst of all possible Cambodian outcomes for

 Bangkok, since Vietnamese-controlled forces would then confront the Thai
 directly along their border with Cambodia.
 In short, the status quo, with a Chinese-oriented Cambodia serving as a
 buffer between Vietnam and Thailand, would seem the best possible situation
 for Bangkok. Other ASEAN states would also quietly approve a stalemate
 between Cambodia and Vietnam.
 The View From Mosocow
 The USSR has fully supported Hanoi in the Vietnamese-Cambodian
 fighting, while accusing Peking of encouraging Cambodian mischief along the
 border. Soviet press coverage of the Sino-Vietnamese imbroglio over the
 ethnic Chinese issue also reflects Moscow's readiness to exploit the rapid
 deterioration of relations between Peking and Hanoi. Moscow has been quick
 to label the issue as one involving Chinese "interference" in Vietnam's
 internal affairs, implicitly warning all Southeast Asian leaders that China
 might use the overseas Chinese to stir up problems in their countries as well.
 While the USSR has no major economic stake or vital strategic
 objectives in Southeast Asia, it has long sought-with limited success to
 date-to counter Chinese influence in the region. Moscow, of course, will
 welcome continuing polemics between Peking and Hanoi and will use the
 opportunity to bolster its own influence and presence in Vietnam. Over the
 longer term, the Soviets almost certainly see closer ties with Hanoi as the key
 to extending their influence deeper into the region. At the same time, Moscow
 views the potential development of a second "front" against China in
 Vietnam-complementing the Soviet front in the north-as a new contribu-
 tion to its strategic interests vis-a-vis Peking.
 Prospects
 While the brouhaha over Vietnam's Chinese population will leave a
 bitter aftertaste in both Peking and Hanoi-as well as increase apprehensions
 in other Southeast Asian countries with large overseas Chinese communi-
 ties-this specific issue will probably subside if the Chinese refugees from
 Vietnam are resettled without major delays or problems.
 Even if the overseas Chinese issue is resolved or pushed aside, however,
 Sino-Vietnamese relations are not likely to improve in the near future.
 Cambodia remains a far more important bone of contention between the two
 countries, and the prospects are for continued fighting. Hanoi now seems to
 have abandoned all hope of reaching an acceptable modus vivendi with the
 present Cambodian leadership and probably is embarked on a long-term
 effort to bring a more malleable regime to power in Phnom Penh. Under these

 continue to denounce Hanoi as a "regional
 In addition to strong propaganda commentary, Peking can and probably
 will resort to a number of other measures to remind Hanoi of China's
 influence and capabilities in the region. These are likely to include further
 reductions in economic assistance and trade, military posturing along the
 border, increased diplomatic attempts to convince other countries-especially
 in Southeast Asia-to reduce China's dealings with Vietnam, and perhaps a
 more aggressive assertion of its claims to islands in the South China Sea,
 which are disputed by Vietnam as well as other countries.
 One possible outcome of the current downward spiral in Sino-Vietnam-
 ese relations is increased Soviet influence in Vietnam. If the Chinese follow
 through on their threats to terminate economic assistance to Vietnam, now
 about one quarter of Hanoi's foreign aid, the Soviets and their East European
 allies almost certainly will pick up the Chinese portion. In return, Moscow
 undoubtedly will anticipate political and perhaps military concessions from
 Hanoi. At a minimum, Hanoi could be expected to become a firmer supporter
 of Moscow's side in the Sino-Sovict dispute and of other Soviet foreign policy
 objectives.
 If the present leaders in Phnom Penh were to be replaced with others
 subservient to Hanoi, the impact would be far reaching. Hanoi's image of
 restraint, which has been carefully nurtured since the end of the Indochina
 war, would be badly tarnished. In Bangkok and other Southeast Asian
 capitals, apprehension about Vietnamese intentions would increase sharply
 and probably would create heightened interest in joint security arrangements.
 Hanoi's dominance of Indochina and Moscow's presumably closer ties to
 Vietnam would be a sharp blow to Peking's interests and would set the stage
 for an even more intense confrontation with Hanoi. If Hanoi felt it was under
 intolerable pressures, it might accede to a Soviet military presence in
 Vietnam, long one of Peking's major fears about Soviet intentions toward the
 region.
 Whatever the fate of the current regime in Phnom Penh, the rancor and
 bitterness that have developed between Peking and Hanoi over the past year
 will not die quickly. In fact, Sino-Vietnamese rivalry is likely to intensify.
 While fundamental but largely contained tensions between Peking and Hanoi
 have up to now been the central element of the postwar political equilibrium
 in Southeast Asia, a prolonged confrontation between the two states could
 work to disrupt regional stability. The ASEAN states may over the shorter
 term take some comfort from the fact that Vietnam, already preoccupied with
 internal problems and a frontier war with neighboring Cambodia, is further
 distracted by its dispute with China. At the same time, however, regional
 hopes to keep the lid on Great Power maneuvering and rivalry in the area over

 the longer run have been set back by the open political warfare between
 China and Vietnam.
 ASEAN capitals already are concerned about the possibility of a more
 aggressive and supportive Chinese approach to overseas Chinese populations
 in the wake of Peking's intervention on behalf of local Chinese in Vietnam.
 Southeast Asian leaders probably also realize that the stage may be set for
 more direct Sino-Vietnamese rivalry for influence within the Thai Commu-
 nist party and for insurgency, a development that ultimately could result in
 the rebels posing a much more serious threat to Bangkok. Finally, the Sino-
 Vietnamese split seems certain to further strain relations between China and
 the USSR as the two countries maneuver for position and influence in the
 region.
