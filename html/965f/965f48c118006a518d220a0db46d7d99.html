 Tokyo remains committed to reducing the government debt, estimated
 at $540 billion.  Nakasone, therefore, wants to:
 --Maintain budgetary austerity and force deficit reduction.
 --Privatize public corporations.
 --Avoid resorting to fiscal measures to stimulate domestic demand.
 Relying on exports to fuel economic growth has created tension in
 Japan's relations with most of its trading partners, especially with the
 United States.  To head off US protectionism, Nakasone has:
 --Agreed in the May 1984 yen/dollar accord to liberalize financial
 markets.
 --Cooperated with Washington's Market Oriented Sector Specific
 (MOSS) approach to open markets in telecommunications,
 pharmaceutical/medical goods, electronics, and forest products.
 --Pushed through the July action program which reduced tariffs and
 eased standards and certification procedures.
 None of these measures is likely to make a big dent in the trade
 surplus, at least in the near term.  To placate its trade partners,
 Japan has relaxed budget discipline to permit expansion of defense and
 foreign aid.
 Under the leadership of Prime Minister Nakasone, Japan has become
 more confident and assertive.  Although the US-Japan relationship
 remains the cornerstone of Japan's foreign policy, Tokyo is increasingly
 willing to pursue its own interests.
 --Despite Nakasone's interest in promoting dialogue with Moscow, his
 support for stronger defenses and alliance with the US suggests
 Japanese relations with the Soviet Union will remain cool.
 --Despite Japan's trade surplus with China, Nakasone's trip to
 Beijing last year and the ministerial meeting last month showed
 the importance Tokyo attaches to their relationship.
 --Although Japan is trying to expand ties to Europe, the Europeans
 are becoming increasingly critical of Japanese trade practices,
 and Nakasone's tour of Europe did not ease their conerns.
 --Despite Japan's support for South Korea, it is increasing its
 contacts with the North since the lifting of Rangoon sanctions.
 --Criticism from ASEAN has been temporarily defused by the trade
 package, but demands for access to Japanese markets will grow.
 --In an effort to play a role in Mideast peace efforts, Japan last
 month invited Iran's number two man, Rafsanjani, to Tokyo and sent
 Foreign Minister Abe visited Syria, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia.

 HONG KONG
 The December 1984 signing of the Sino-UK accord on Hong Kong's future
 ushered in a twelve year transitional period during which the territory's
 political and economic future as a Special Administrative Region of China will
 be shaped by a number of specialized committees:
 -- The Joint Liaison Group, comprised of Chinese, British, and Hong Kong
 Government officials, which will resolve issues of common interest to
 all parties.  First meeting in July confirmed the territory's
 continued participation in the Asian Development Bank.
 -- The Joint Land Commission will adjudicate land sales and rentals prior
 to the territory's reversion to Chinese control in 1997.
 -- The Basic Law Draft Committee, established by the Chinese government,
 includes 24 Hong Kong citizens.  The committee will draft the "basic
 law" that will govern Hong Kong for fifty years beyond 1997.
 At the same time, the Hong Kong government has embarked on a course of
 "democratizing" the territory's political scene.
 -- In March 1985 the first "popular" elections for District Board members
 took place.
 -- This fall voters will indirectly elect members to the Legislative
 Council, whose members had previously been appointed by the Hong Kong
 Governor.
 -- The government hopes to introduce direct elections to the territory's
 top legislative bodies by 1987.
 -- Nascent political parties are forming, most notably the Progressive
 Hong Kong Society under the leadership of Legislative Councilor Maria
 Tam.
 the local Xinhua news agency--Beijing's unofficial
 representative in the territory--is monitoring individuals it believes are
 unsympathetic to Beijing's interests.
 After a bad year in 1984, the Hong Kong economy has rebounded.  The stock
 market reached its highest ever levels earlier this year, and investor
 confidence in the territory's economic viability has been restored.
 -- The Hong Kong Government nonetheless remains concerned over the
 effects US restrictions on trade may have on the local textile
 industry.
 -- Handling of the failure of the Overseas Trust Bank by monetary
 authorities has created some concern about growing intervention of the
 government in Hong Kong's freewheeling economy.

 SOUTH KOREA:  MAJOR ISSUES
 President Chun Doo Hwan has retreated from political liberalization
 and is adopting hardline tactics that could provoke a backlash.
 -- Chun is increasingly falling under the influence of hardliners
 among his personal advisors.
 -- Student dissidents are being branded pro-communist and some are
 being charged under national security laws.  The President is
 pushing a campus stabilization law that includes re-education
 camps for convicted dissident students.
 -- The emergence of a potent opposition party in last February's
 parliamentary elections -- the New Korea Democratic Party -- has
 turned the National Assembly into a forum for heated debates on
 sensitive political issues.
 President Chun is trying to bolster his image at home by promoting a
 statesmanlike image.
 -- Seoul is engaging Pyongyang in a multi-channel dialogue.
 Agreements in principle have been reached regarding reunions of
 separated families and formation of an economic cooperation
 committee; a joint team for the Seoul 1988 Olympics is being
 discussed.  We remain skeptical, however, about any early
 breakthroughs.
 -- Chun plans to speak at the UN General Assembly meeting
 this fall and seeks a public meeting with President Reagan at
 that time.  Perceived United States support for Chun, however,
 has spurred nascent anti-Americanism among some intellectuals.
 The recent improvement in North Korea's relations with the Soviet
 Union represents, we believe, a tactical adjustment in the P'yongyang-
 Moscow-Beijing triangle.
 -- Recent Soviet military deliveries -- including Mig-23s -- will
 not destabilize the military balance on the peninsula.
 -- They will, however, prompt Seoul to press for closer military
 ties to Washington.
 Sluggish economic growth has prompted Seoul to loosen its austere
 monetary and fiscal policies in order to spur growth.
 --   Government estimates of real 1985 GNP growth have been
 revised downward to 6.3% from 7.5%, due to a
 slump in exports -- 5 to 6% growth is likely.
 --   Washington is pressing Seoul to accelerate market opening
 measures that are strongly resisted by Korean businessmen and
 conservative economic policymakers.  Seoul is also concerned
 about possible US restrictions on footwear and textiles.

 Thailand:   Political and Economic Developments
 Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda  is approaching the halfway
 mark of his second term in a strong political position:
 --Appointed in 1980, the retired general has now remained
 in office longer than any previous civilian head of
 government.
 In the meantime, however, the Bangkok political pot continues
 to simmer.   Party politics and military restiveness will periodically
 increase tensions:
 support of senior military officers and the monarchy.
 --Prem has benefited from the Thai economy's generally good    25X1
 performance during the past several years and from the
 --Quarrels within the ruling coalition may prompt Prem
 to reshuffle his cabinet later this year. Nonetheless,
 dissidents in the ruling parties probably are not powerful
 enough to to threaten government stability.
 r em  robabl
 can continue to outmaneuver his opponents.                       25X1
 On the  economic front,   Prem  is implementing a  package of
 reforms and   belt-tightening measures to  boost exports and ease
 recent balance  of payments  problems.    Despite  a good  overall
 economic performance, Thailand's balance of payments deteriorated
 sharply in 1983 and  has  improved  only modestly  since    then--
 largely  due to  slower import  growth.     Moreover,   Bangkok                  is
 concerned by its rising foreign debt obligations and committed to
 maintaining its good  international  credit rating.      Political
 considerations,    however,   will limit  Prem's  ability to  make
 reforms:
 more year.
 --Austerity measures must be handled carefully to avoid
 provoking the military, the opposition, and labor groups.
 --Structural reforms--designed to improve the efficiency of the

 Singapore Experiences a Rare Period of Decline
 Prime Minister LEE Kuan Yew's People's Action Party won only 63 percent of
 the popular vote in the December 1984 national election--down from 76 percent in
 1980--and two opposition parties placed spokesmen in the traditionally single-
 party Parliament.

 style of Lee--J. B. JAYARETNAM, Workers' Party, and CHIAM See Tong,
 Singapore Democratic Party, have sparked debate over a wide range of
 Lee has announced that he will retire from politics after the 1988 elections
 --when he reaches age 65.  Most Singaporeans, however, are skeptical.  Cabinet is
 drafting a constitutional amendment to make the ceremonial presidency an elective
 office and give the president the power to veto spending of reserves accumulated
 by previous governments.  Moving into the presidency would allow Lee to turn over
 the day-to-day overnin  to a handpicked successor while retaining substantial
 control.
 ? Three MPs in their early 40s--GOH Chok Tong, First Deputy.Prime Minister and
 Minister of Defense; MG Teng Cheong, Second Deputy Prime Minister and
 Secretary General of the National Trades Union Congress; and Tony TAN Keng
 Yam, Minister of Education and of Trade and Industry--have survived a decade
 of leadership testing by Lee and are thought to be in the running to become
 ? The Prime Minister's son, Brigadier General LEE Hsien Loong (Res.), 33,
 handily won a seat in Parliament in December 1984--after rising to flag rank
 in the Army in a short 13 years.  He holds two junior ministerial posts and
 may move into Cabinet within a year.  As head of the newly created Economic
 Committee, he is in the spotlight.  Many Singaporeans assume he is being
 groomed to succeed his father.                                            25X1
 Singapore in 1985 is experiencing the most dramatic economic recession in
 its 26-year history.  Projected 1985 gross domestic product for Singapore is

 CHINA:  Current Domestic Issues
 Deng Xiaoping and his allies are pressing forward aggressively on key
 reforms despite unanticipated problems in implementing their economic
 program.  September's national conference of party delegates, slated to
 endorse a substantial turnover in the top leadership and lay the groundwork
 for the 7th Five Year Plan, will be the political event of the year.
 The party leadership faces a wide range of pressing domestic issues:
 The Economy.  Deng's critics have sought to use the shortcomings of
 reform to slow the pace and scope of change.
 -- Since early spring, the reformers have implemented market-style
 adjustments as well as administrative measures to control the
 inflation, drawdown of foreign exchange reserves, and excessive
 industrial growth and capital construction caused by reform.
 -- Partly to defuse the criticism of party old timers, Beijing is
 taking steps to curb the rising incidence of official corruption.
 -- Wage and price reforms remain the key to the economic program and
 are being implemented gradually
 Personnel Rejuvenation.  Against the rearguard actions of party
 traditionalists, Deng has accelerated the pace of personnel turnover in key
 national and provincial posts.
 -- Since April, 13 new provincial secretaries and 7 provincial
 governors have been installed.  Generally, the new leaders are men
 and women in their fifties, approximately a decade younger than
 their predecessors.
 -- The obstructionist director of party propaganda was fired in July.
 -- At the September party conference, Deng will attempt to stack the
 Central Committee by adding some 50 new members from the ranks of
 younger, pro-reform leaders.  Key reformers will also be added to
 the Politburo and Secretariat.
 -- Beijing has publicized the "retirement" of approximately 1.1
 million officials and wants to reach 2 million by yearend.
 Party Reform.  A party "rectification" campaign is now in its second of
 three years.  The drive seeks to balance traditional concerns of the party old
 guard against the requirements of reform.
 -- Rectification consequently is concentrating on cleaning up
 official corruption--the bete noir of party veterans--while
 ensuring a pro-reform membership through careful recruitment--
 cooptation--of an educated elite and simultaneous purge of
 politically unreliable members.
 The Military.  Rejuvenation and streamlining are proceeding in the
 military as well but remain politically controversial.  With a few important
 exceptions, the military high command has undergone a major shakeup.
 -- Streamlining and foreign military sales will allow modernization
 in select areas that depend on access to foreign (largely Western)
 technology.
 -- The effect of manpower reductions probably is not as drastic as
 implied by the announced cut of about 1 million men.
 Succession.  According to stories circulating in Beijing, Deng ultimately
 intends party Secretary Hu Qili to succeed General Secretary Hu Yaobang, while
 Vice Premier Li Peng reportly will replace Premier Zhao Ziyang.
 -- Rumors that Deng plans to retire as Military Commission Chairman
 in favor of Hu Yaobang appear premature in the light of recent
 propaganda asserting Deng's continuing vigor and mental alertness.

 Burma:  Major Political and Economic Issues
 The  succession question--Burma's  most important  political
 issue--was addressed at the Fifth Congress of the Burma Socialist
 Program Party, held in early August:
 --Ne Win retained his position as Party Chairman and de facto
 leader of Burma.  Barring serious health problems, we expect
 him to hold the reins of power for the foreseeable future.
 --President San Yu--Ne Win's longtime confidant--was selected
 for the newly created post of Party Vice Chairman, firmly
 establishing him as second in command and the most probable
 successor to Ne Win.
 Insurgencies    remain    Burma's  major    internal    security
 problem--although none of  the groups is capable  of overthrowing
 the government.    Because the insurgents   are heavily involved in
 narcotics production and trafficking,   Rangoon's efforts to crack
 down  on  them  have  included  an  aerial  eradication program,
 supported by US agencies. Burma nonetheless produces    about 90
 percent of Southeast Asia's opium.
 In addition to increasing its   cooperation with  the United
 States in narcotics control,   Burma has stepped up its diplomatic
 activity with other countries in the past several months.   Ne Win
 recently visited Beijing,    where Chinese leaders assured  him of
 decreased support for the Burmese Communist Party.    As a result,
 relations between the two countries have improved.
 Rangoon's  most    pressing  economic  problem  remains  the
 country's sharp decline in export earnings:
 --Rice exports, which provide 40 percent of the country's foreign
 exchange earnings, may fall to half of last year's levels due to
 poor quality and high prices.
 --Exports of timber, cement, and urea have aggravated domestic
 shortages and crimped the country's development plans.
 --Cuts in imports and foreign borrowing--while necessary to control
 Burma's mounting debt service ratio--have further limited the
 economv's growth.
 2oDM
 To  boost  foreign  exchange  revenues,    Rangoon  plans  to
 diversify its exports to higher sales-value crops.   In addition,
 it plans to develop natural gas  reserves in the Gulf of Martaban
 to produce gas, urea, and ammonia for export.    With a $1 billion
 outlay required,  however,   Rangoon probably  will have to accept
 foreign participation in  the project-- which it so  far has been
 unwilling to do.                                                                25X1
