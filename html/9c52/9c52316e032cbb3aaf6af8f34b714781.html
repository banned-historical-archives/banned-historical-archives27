DAILY BRIEF 
I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC 
� Communist China: For the second time in less than a 
month, the Chinese Communist Party's top theoretical jour-
nal, Red Flag, has emphasized that negotiations between the 
bloc and the West, regardless of their success in "reaching 
some sort of agreement," should not lead Communists to 
abandon their long-term struggle against the West. The ar-
ticle, apparently directed toward justifying the continuation 
of the "tense situation" in Sino-American relations, rebuts 
the "revisionist" view of Tito--and, by implication, the views 
a Khrushchev--that "nations can relax," and asks: "Is there 
tranquillity in our Taiwan Strait?" (Page 1) 
USSR-India: Moscow has reportedly offered New Delhi 
"unlimited" amounts of crude oil at discount prices in an at-
tempt to stress the USSR's ability to supply India's petroleum 
needs. Despite the attractiveness of the offer, New Delhi 
would encounter difficulty in utilizing much Soviet crude, but 
may use the Soviet offer to exert pressure for pricing conces-
sions from the three Western companies which operate most of 
India's refining capacity. (Page 3)

*South Korea: The announcement that President Rhee has 
agreed to lead a parliamentary system of government with a 
cabinet headed by a prime minister, is probably a device to re-

i J0 election of Yi Ki-pung to the vice presidency sparked the re-

Laos: The wile oi tne French UNESCO official, who was mur-
deredri-ii 1 April in a resort near Vientiane, says she received 
the "clear impression" that her husband's assailants had mistaken 
him for an American. The American Embassy in Vientiane com-
ments that if this is valid, it would tend to support previously un-
confirmed reports that the Communist Pathet Lao insurgents had 
issued a directive early this month calling for "positive action" 
against Americans. The embassy has prohibited Americans from 
traveling outside Vientiane until after the national elections this  
Sunday.  
Japan: �ine nationwide leftist campaign against ratification of 
the US-japanese security treaty is likely to be exploited by ex-
tremists who plan a violent student-led demonstration in front of 
the Diet building on 26 April. Government officials plan to mobil-
ize 10,000 police equipped with tear gas to cope with the demon-
strations. Leftist extremism could delay the ratification schedule, 
but it will antagonize the Japanese public and probably undercut op-
position to the treaty. (Page 7)

Peiping Reaffirms Disagreement With Soviet Policy of Detente 
For the second time in less than a month the Chinese Com-
munist party's top theoretical journal, Red Flag, has emphasized 
that negotiations between the bloc and the West, regardless of 
their success in "reaching some sort of agreement," should not 
lead Communists to abandon their long-term struggle against 
the West. The article, apparently directed toward justifying 
the continuation of the "tense situation" in Sino-American re-
lations, rebuts the "revisionist" view of Tito--and,by impli-
cation, the views of Khrushchev--that "nations can relax," 
and asks: "Is there tranquillity in our Taiwan Strait?" The 
article strongly implies that foreign policy differences between 
Peiping and Moscow arise mainly from the Chinese view that 
China has nothing to gain from a policy of detente with the 
West. 
The latest Red Flag article suggests that Peiping may be 
developing a strong propaganda line in anticipation of possible 
developments at the summit and disarmament conferences. On 
22 April the chief of the party's propaganda department stated 
that although it is "entirely permissible and necessary" that 
bloc countries conduct negotiations with the West, they should 
guard against reducing their "revolutionary spirit"

policies. The article implies that Lenin's "original" con-
clusions and a Communist's "usual conception of Leninism" 
have been distorted for policy reasons by Moscow, particular-
ly on the issue of the inevitability of war. It insists that local 
wars still "count as wars" and emphasizes, in a tone contrary 
to that of statements made at the Soviet 21st party congress, 
the continuing possibility of war. 
[ln another area of Sino-Soviet difference, the representa-
tive of Peiping's official news agency in East Berlin stated on 
14 April that Mao Tse-tung is the most important living Yfarxist 
and ranks just behind Lenin in interpreting Marxist philosophy 
correctly. He characterized Khrushchev as "simply" premier 
of the USSR and first secretary of the Soviet party, implying 
that the Soviet leader is a theorist of little stature in Chinese  
eyes. These views.  
are in line with extravagant claims being made publicly for 
Mao in China.

USSR Offers "Unlimited" Quantities of Crude Oil to India  
Moscow reportedly has offered New Delhi "unlimited" 
amounts of Soviet crude oil and some refined products at dis-
count prices with payment in Indian rupees. While couching 
its offer in unusually attractive terms to stress its willing-
ness to supply a major part of Indiabpetroleum needs, the 
Soviet Union probably hopes to achieve only limited results 
by partially replacing Western oil suppliers. 
Despite the attractiveness of the Soviet offer, not only in 
price but also in foreign-exchange savings, India would face 
major difficulties in utilizing Soviet crude. The three Western-
owned refineries which process all of India's imported crude 
(35,000,000 barrels in 1959) would not be obligated under their 
present contracts to use the Soviet crude and would certainly 
resist any Indian pressures in this direction. The only govern-
ment-owned refineries, Barauni and Gauhati, both of which are 
being built with bloc assistance, are located Well inland in east-
ern India and are designed to refine the relatively small quanti-
ties of crude oil produced by India. New Delhi may, therefore, 
accept the offer of refined products as part of a long-term agree-
ment already reported in the offing, while using the offer of 
Soviet crude as a lever to extract pricing concessions from the 
Western companies. 
This is the first time the USSR has offered crude oil to 
India� Earlier Soviet-Indian oil negotiations resulted in the 
inclusion, for the first time, of small amounts of Soviet pe-
troleum products in the annual trade agreement for 1960-61. 
The USSR frequently has exploited trade opportunities in other 
underdeveloped countries by agreeing to provide Soviet oil in 
barter or soft currency transactions.

South Korea 
The announcement that President Rhee has agreed to a par-
liamentary system of government with a cabinet headed by a 
prime minister, is probably a device to resolve the present po-
litical crisis by eliminating the controversial vice presidency. 
The fraudulent tactics used in the 15 March election of Yi Ki-
pung to the vice presidency sparked the recent outburst of popu-
lar violence. Under a parliamentary system prior to 1954, 
Rhee as president was able to exercise the powers usually as-
sociated with the prime minister. It is problematical whether 
any prominent members of the opposition Democratic party would 
participate in a coalition if such an arrangement is proposed by 
Rhee. 
Rhee may. contemplate selecting a prime minister, from 
among five former political lieutenants with whom he consulted 
on 21 April. The five, whose popularity is questionable, had 
been dropped by Rhee after either outliving their usefulness or 
showing signs of acquiring political power of their own. Rhee's 
objective may be to install a man who could assure the admin-
istration's control over, the Liberal Party and National Assem-
bly. 
Rhee, who has maintained that the nationwide demonstra-
tions were Communist-instigated, may have belatedly recog-
nized to some extent the public resentment against his admin-
istration.  ffTevertheless,  
Rhee is under pressure from leaders of the Liberal   
Party, the police and the State Council not to agree to decisions 
which would work against themA The embassy and American 
information officers throughout South Korea report that US state-

Yi ICi-pung has publicly said he is considering renouncing his 
election. Chang told the American army attache on 22 April 
that, following his resignation, the party will file a resolution 
in the National Assembly calling for the resignation of Pres-
ident Fthee and Yi Ki-pung. Chang's resignation probably is 
intended to maintain the momentum of the popular drive, and 
it will provide further unsettling effects on the South Korean 
situation;) 
Student restiveness continues throughout South Korea, with 
one major demonstration reportedly dispersed on 22 April by 
police without casualties in the port city of Inchon, which is not 
under martial law. Martial-law commander Lt. Gen. Song Yo-
chan has ordered restrictions relaxed in Seoul and other cities 
under martial law, and in the capital all but about 100 of the 
1,700 demonstrators seized by the police have been released. 
In the provincial capital of Kwangju, however, there are wide-
spread rumors that some 600 students still held by the author-
ities are being tortured, and the city appears "cowed rather than 
quiet." Although army troops fired on student demonstrators on 
21 April, the people of Kwangju reportedly tend to regard the sol-
diers as "moderators" between themselves and police.

Disorder in South Korea May Spread to Taiwan  
The disorder in South Korea has increased the possibility 
of protest demonstrations over any irregularities during local 
elections on 24 April in Taiwan, where developments in Korea 
are being followed closely. Major demonstrations on the day 
of the elections appear unlikely, but blatant election irregulari-
ties could generate incidents such as fist fights at polling sta-
tions. Defeat of any of several independent candidates by a 
narrow margin in one of the hotly contested races could incite 
open accusations that the elections were rigged in favor of the 
Kuomintang candidate. 
Yang Chiu-hu, a member of the opposition Democratic So-
cialist party, petitioned President Chiang Kai-shek at a recent 
session of the National Assembly to require the ruling Kuomintang 
party to clean up elections on Taiwan. Independent Taiwanese 
politicians and newspapers also have criticized the Kuomintang 
for election irregularities--such as ballot-box stuffing, plural 
voting, and unfair invalidation of ballots--and requested that op-
position s well as Kuomintang candidates be allowed to appoint 
poll supervisors. Government and Kuomintang officials have re-
jected this demand. 
The Kuomintang wants to display overwhelming popular sup-
port by winning a majority of the contests, but it is anxious to 
avoid a shutout of minority representation. The party has re-
frained from nominating a full slate of candidates and in some 
contests surreptitiously supports independent candidates to 
foster a facade of opposition. Local party officials, however, 
are conscious of the adverse effect independent representation 
might have on their political careers and may ignore party 
orders to avoid any actions which might give rise to demonstra-
tions.

Japanese Demonstrations Against Security Treaty With US  
The nationwide leftist campaign against ratification of the 
US-Japanese security treaty is likely to be exploited by ex-
tremists, who are planning a student-led violent demonstra-
tion in front of the Diet on 26 April, about the time the lower 
house plans to put the treaty to a vote. The opposition So-
cialists, who already have halted committee hearings on the 
treaty by preventing the chairman from taking his seat, may 
also resort to nonparliamentary action to delay or even pre-
vent a floor vote. 
Some 30,000 members of Zengakuren, the radical uni-
versity students' association, are planning to exploit the 
demonstration already scheduled by 70-80,000 members of 
organizations participating in the leftist-sponsored Peiaple's 
Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty. Zengakuren 
leaders--many of whom have been expelled from the Japanese 
Communist party for extremism, including the precipitation 
of a riot at the Tokyo airport when Prime Minister Kishi 
departed for Washington last January to sign the new treaty--
have rejected the council's program as "too passive and in-
effective." 
Government leaders are concerned that Zengakuren, 
prompted by the student riots in South Korea, may resort to 
its most violent action to date. Accordingly, they plan to 
mobilize 10,000 police equipped with tear gas to cope with 
the situation. In the final analysis, however, leftist ex-
tremism, while possibly upsetting the treaty ratification sched-
ule, will antagonize the general Japanese public and probably 
prove counterproductive by undercutting opposition to the treaty.

of Posts,. Telegraphs, and Health Albert Hertzog, has reported-
ly been exploring ways of easing racial tension by applying 
the apartheid policy less harshly. These efforts were reflected 
In Sauer's 19 April call for "an important change in the practi-
cal application of government policy," involving revision of the 
stringent native pass laws, higher wages for urban Africans, 
and increased interracial contaFg 
E4auer has been publicly rebuked by External Affairs Min-
ister Eric Louw and Minister of Bantu Administration M. D. C. 
de Wet Nel, the spokesmen for the conservative Nationalists. 
Louw told Parliament on 20 April that the government's policy 
"remains unchanged" and that changes could be made only by 
Verwoerd. Sauer's speech was also criticized by the Nation-
alist newspaper Die Vaderland, whose board of directors in-
cludes Hertzog and three other cabinet members. Die Vader-
land's criticism may indicate that the other members of the 
rxicide-rate faction in the cabinet are hesitant to give public sup-
port to Sauer's proposals as a result  of the negative party re-
action to them._

Guinea Regime Reported Moving Against Opposition  
President Sekou Tours and the influential left wing of Guinea's 
authoritarian regime are taking vigorous measures to suppress 
elements which have recently moved to establish a rival political 
party;  
Toure's militant and highly disciplined Democratic party of Guinea 
has been the sole political organization and the real governing 
authority in the country since shortly after Guinea voted for inde-
pendence from France in September 1958. 
The opposition movement, which reportedly is headed by Jus-
tice Minister Ibrahima Barry and includes several other ministers, 
appears inspired in large part by the traditional hostility of the 
hinterland Foulah tribe toward the Malinke and Soussous tribesmen 
who predominate in Toure's regime. Rumors of increasing unrest 
among the Foulahs have been circulating in Guinea since late 1959. 
In the last few days, these have become more specific in nature, 
pointing to an early attempt by Barry to establish an opposition 
party pledged to moderating the regime's strongly socialist-oriented 
internal policies and reversing its drift toward the Soviet bloc. The 
opposition group reportedly favors the establishment of "Common-
wealth ties" with France. 
There appears little likelihood that Tours and his group, who 
are believed to be in firm control of the security apparatus, will 
be overturned in the near future. Repressive action, including 
house-to-house searches for antiregime propaganda and the arrest 
of one minister= not Barry= and many second-echelon opposition 
leaders, reportedly began on 19 April. However, a desire not to 
reveal publicly the extent of the split within the government may 
influence Tours to move against other top opposition leaders one 
by one rather than to arrest them all now. 
Although there is no evidence available of direct French support 
and guidance of the opposition movement,

French involvement is "very likely." In a 21 April pub-
lic statement probably related to the reported action against the 
opposition, Toure charged that "French colonialism," in collab-
oration with "certain Africans," had organized a "counterrevolu-
tionary plot" aimed at sabotaging the country's economic inde-
pendence. This blast may presage further difficulties for the 
� dwindling French business community in Guinea.
