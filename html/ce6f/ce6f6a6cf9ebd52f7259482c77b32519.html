Dean Insists Before Senate 
Inquiry President Knew, 
About the Plot Earlier: ? 
By DAVID E. ROSENBAILIN 
Special tee Thr New York Tlmea 
WASHINGTON, June 20?A 
White House account of Presi-
dent Nixon's conversations 
this year with John W. Dean 3d 
charges that Mr. Dean, despite 
constant pressure from the 
President, withheld front Mr. 
Nixon all information about 
White House Involvement In 
the Watergate burglary and 
cover-up until March 21. , 
On the other hand, a surb-
mary prepared by lawyers on 
the Senate/Watergate commit-
tee of their interrogation of Mr. 
Dean last Saturday containg 
Mr. Dean's assertion that Mr. 
Nixon knew earlier about the, 
cover-up plot. ? 
Much of the evidence against 
the President that Mr.' Dean 
gave the committee staff is 
hearsay, according to the sum-
mary. But he told of some di7.' 
rect '.convetsations with the 
President in which aspects of 
ithe..covor-up.. had been dig-
'Fussed, 
U. S.-Soviet Summitry 
With the Senate committee 
.in recess for a week, the capi-
'tat had planned to devote its 
'full attenUon to the United 
States and Soviet summitry. 
But details of Mr. Dean's 
long interview last week have 
been filtering into print for. 
Several days, amid suggestions 
that ? the White House and 
the Senate investigators, each 
recognizing the importance of. 
Mr. Dean's testimony in public. 
next week, *ere trying to 
ishape the public's attitude 
toward his eventual appear-
ance. 
Much of what was contained's 
inent and the ? abbre 
in both the White Hvg Jocu-
rayed IfraitietakgkeiNMICIMIRMINMOTelg18?U19"ng: 
count of win Dean's testimony', 
had come to light previously. 
But there were some new or 
more detailed allegations by 
Mr. Dean, a central 'figure in 
the Watergate case. They in-
cluded the following: 
41That the President, in a' 
conversation with Mr. Dean 
last September, directed an ef-
fort to block a ';Watergate 
investigation by a House com7' 
mittee and urged Mr. Dean to 
prepare to "take care of" re-
porters unfriendly to the White 
House. ? 
(Mat Charles W. Colson, a 
former White House special 
Counsel, and John D. Ehrlich-
man, the former domestic ad-
viser to the President, had 
'sought from Mr. Nixon permis-
sion to promise executive 
clemency to E. Howard Hunt 
Jr., one of the Watereate con-
spirators. Mr. Dean said that 
he had "heard this" from Mr. 
Colson and later this spring 
had a. "discussion with the 
President" about the clemency 
offer. ? 
clThat Mr. Dean had been ip-
structed by Mr. Ehrlichman 
and H. R. Haldeman, the for-
mer White House chief of 
staff, to enlist the aid of Lieut. 
Gen. Vernon A. Walters, the 
deputy director of the Central 
Intelligence Agency, in cover-
ing up the Watergate con. 
spiracy. Mr. Dean's account 
was that the White House aides 
said that General Walters 
"'owed his allegiance to the, 
White House," but that the 
C.I.A. official had declined to 
help. 
?EIThat Mr. Nixon had told 
Mr. Dean that the late director; 
of the Federal Bureau of In-1 
vestigation, J. Edgar Hoover, 
had advised the President that 
he "had been bugged" in the 
1968 campaign, and that Mr. 
Nixon believed the White House 
should use the information to 
its advantage at some point. 
List of Dates Released , 
The White House released 
several days ago a list of the 
dates on which Mr. Dean had 
met with Mr. Nixon. But not 
until the summary sent to the 
Senate committee became avail-
able today had there been any 
indication of the White House 
version of the substance of the 
discussions. 
Papers Made Available 
The White House account 
was submitted to the Senate 
committee this week. It and the 
summary of the investigators' 
intervietaw with Mr. Dean, the 
former White House counsel, 
were made availabue to The 
New York Times by persons 
with access to committee 
documents. 
The White House account 
was five pages long and, ac-
cording to Senate sources, was 
prepared by J. Fred Buzhardt, 
Jr., special counsel to the Presi, 
stance of 18 meetings this year 
between the President and Mr. 
Dean. ? 
Mr. Dean And White House 
spokesman have agreed that 
there were more than 35 dis-
cussions between President 
Nixon and his former counsel 
between late January and April 
of this year, some face-to-face, 
and others by telephone. 
Met Almost Daily 
From March 1 until March 23, 
according to the account, the 
President and Mr. Dean met 
about the Watergate affair al-
most daily: 
In answer to questions from 
the President, Mr. Dean said 
time and again at the early 
meetings that there was no 
White House involvement in the 
purglary or the cover-up, the 
account states. But it says that 
Mr. .Nixon was told by Mr. 
Dean on March 13 that Gordon 
C. Strachan, then the top as: 
srstant to H. II. Haldeman, 
%lite House chief of . staff, 
"could be involved." 
'Pe was not until March '21; 
the account states, that Mr. 
De4p "gave the President his 
t.170iry of what happened." 
11,ffi3 told the President "that 
Magruder probably knew, that 
Mitchell possibly knew, that 
Strathan probably knew, that 
Haldeman had possibly seen 
the fruits of the wiretaps 
through Strachan. that Ehrlich-
man was vulnerable because of 
his approval of Kalmbach's 
funr-raising efforts, the docu-
ment states. 
uz711,?ers Got Summary 
T mate committee- sum-, 
mar Kr. Dean's private tes-
timony ? reducing his 51,4 
hours of testimony last Satur-
day to seven sparse and tan-
talizingly vague pages of alle-
gations ? was prepared by a 
junior staff n member and dis4 
tributed to he seven commit-
tee members on Monday by 
Samuel DCM, the chief coun-
sel. ? 
The summary presented a 
vivid picture of widespread at-
tempts within ?? . the ?. upper 
reaches of the White' House 
and the Committee for the Re-
election of the President to 
cover up the magnitude of the 
Watergate, ease. 
Mr. Dean accused H. R. Hal-
deman, the former White House 
chief of staff, of having or-
dered the destruction of infor-
mation obtained from the 
Watergate wiretap, of having 
Joined in planning efforts to 
obtain White House influence 
over the Republican members 
of the Senate investigating 
committee and of attempting 
to persuade John N. Mitchell, 
the former campaign director 
and Attorney General, to "take 
the heat" off other officials by 
assuming the blame for the 
Watergate break-in. 
Mr. Dean, according to the 
summary, alleged that John D. 
Ehrlichman, the former Presi-1 
ential adviser on domestic mat-
ters, had put preseure on Mr.1 
Dean to "lean on" Lieut. Gen.1 
Vernon A. Walters, the deputy! 
director of the Central Intel-1 
agency in a cover-up. 
Accordng to the summary, 
IGeneral Walters "said it. would 
be a bad idea," but Mr. Ehrlich-
man was "dissatisfied" when 
Mr. Dean reported the intel-
ligence official's reluctance to 
.help. 
Linked to Meeting 
Futhermore, Mr. Dean said 
that Mr. Ehrlichman had in 
structed ?him to throw ,wire-
tapping equipment "in Ethel 
river" after the material had 
been discovered In the White' 
House safe of E. Hoard Hunt' 
Jr., one of the Watergate con-, 
spirators. 
Mr. Dean was said to have 
linked Mr. Ehrlichman to al 
meeting on Feb. 10 this year at 
which the plans to try to under--
:mine the Senate investigations 
were discussed. 
? Mr. Dean, according to th& 
isummary, is prepared to testify; 
to the full Senate committee) 
when he appears before it nextl 
week that Mr. Mitchell admit-
ted approving the plans to bug 
the Democratic headquarters 
but said that he believed at 
the time that more care would 
be taken to assure that the par-
ticipants could not be traced 
to the President's campaign 
committee. 
The summary contains the 
most serious allegations to date 
that Charles W. Colson, the 
former special counsel to the 
President, was involved in the 
Watergate conspiracy. Accord-
ing to Mr. Dean's account, Mr. 
Colson had pressed for approv-
al of the bugging plan drafted 
by -G. Gordon Liddy, one of 
the Watergate conspirators. 
In addition, Mr. Dean was 
said to have told the Senate 
investigators that Mr. Colson 
was deeply involved in nego-
tiations at the White House to 
arrange executive clemency for 
Hunt and to provide $122,000 
demanded by Hunt in return 
for silence about Watergate. 
Mr. Colson has insisted that 
he was not involved either in' 
the conspiracy or the attempt-1 
ed cover-up. Mr. dean was said 
to have told the committee that 
he had tape recordings of a 
conversation in which Mr. 
Colson and Hunt discussed the 
demand for hush money. 
The summary of Mr. Dean's 
testimony also related alleged 
involvement by Robert C. 
Mardian?the former Assistant 
Attorney General and political 
counselor to the campaign 
committee ? in the cover-up. 
Mr. Dean contended that Mr.. 
Mardian had gone to Mr. 
Dean's White House office, 
along with lawyers for the re-
election committee, to read 
confidential F.B.I. summaries 
of interrogations of White 
House and campaign officials. 
Criticism of Gray Cited 
Mr. Dean also said, accord-
ing to the summary, that Mr. 
Mardian had voiced criticism 
of the former acting F.B.I. di-
rector, L. Patrick Gray 3d, for 
"pushing too hard" with the 
Watergate investigation last 
.year. Mr. Dean attributedto 
Mr. Mardian the suggestion 
that the White House try to 
.get the Central Intelligence 
Agency to cooperate in a 
,cover-up. ,

Versions in conflict 
over Nixon's role 
By Richard L. Strout 
Staff correspondent of 
The Christian Science Monitor 
Washington 
Two widely conflicting and semi-
official versions of President Nixon's 
relations to the Watergate cover-up 
now have emerged. 
They are condensations by the staff 
of Sen. Sam J. Ervin's committee of 
pre-hearing evidence, the first frotri 
the White House and prepared by J. 
Fred Buzhardt Jr., special counsel of 
Mr. Nixon, and the second by John W. 
Dean HI, former presidential counsel, 
based on sworn testimony which he 
gave the committee in executive 
session. 
The White House version presents 
Mr. Nixon as repeatedly asking Mr. 
Dean, since late February, about 
Watergate and repeatedly being told, 
until March 21, that the White House 
was not involved. 
? The second, from Mr. Dean, postu-
lates that several of the top staff at 
the White House knew of the progress 
of the unsuccessful cover-up. It also 
offers new, behind-the-scenes, details 
like blocking a proposed House com-
mittee inquiry, and a reported charge? 
by J. Edgar "Hoover, late FBI head, 
that Democrats bugged Republicans 
in 1968. 
Much of the Dean testimony, sum-
marized by the Ervin staff, rests on 
hearsay. 
In turn, White House spokesmen 
say they do not vouch for the ac-
curacy of the condensation of their 
versions of an analysis of Nixon-Dean 
talks, prepared by the Ervin com-
mittee. 
The text of the two Ervin committee 
summaries was made available to 
the press in piecemeal form while the 
committee is in recess during the visit 
of Soviet Secretary-General Leonid I. ? 
.Brezhnev. _ 
Like it or not, Washington agrees 
that the trial-by-publicity is going on, 
despite absence of formal hearings, 
and that the issue is historically 
unique, whether President Nixon did, 
or did not, have knowlege of the 
illegal Washington cover-up attempt. 
Dean called 'turncoat 
Without waiting for formal con-
frontation, partisans are talc lug sides; 
Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott 
(R) of Pcrui:,.. IvaitLA, for example, 
branding ousted White House counsel 
Dean as a "turncoat" and "embez-
zler," 
Mr. Dean, through his lawyer, has 
refused to give further preliminary 
executive-session testimony until the 
public hearings. 
In a separate development, the staff 
of Archibald Cox, special prosecutor 
In the Watergate case, reportedly is 
considering calling a new grand jury. 
This would hear allegations that the 
Nixon election organization used ille-
gal pressure to force corporations 
with issues pending before the gov-
ernment, to contribute to campaign 
?funds. Funds ultimately reached 
more than $50 millions. 
Primary attention centers here on 
the contrast between the summary of 
the Dean testimony, and the analysis 
of the Nixon-Dean talks coming from 
the White House. 
Approach differs 
These clash chronologically at a 
few points. But the big difference is 
the approach: 
Throughout the Dean version is 
the basic assumption that knowledge 
of the cover-up attempt was wide-
spread in the White House. 
is Throughout the White House 
analysis is the assumption that Mr. 
-Dean was keeping the truth from 
President Nixon, and that the latter 
was innocent of the cover-up. 
The two accounts do not really meet 
because they are interpretations of 
different matters; but they proceed 
on postulates which get to the heart of 
the issue on which Mr. Nixon's cred-
ibility may ultimately rest. 
The White House analysis is based 
on the log kept on meetings and 
telephone conversations between Mr. 
Nixon and his then counsel. There was 
one meeting on Sept. 15 last year, and 
37 meetings or phone calls since late 
February. 
? The White House repeatedly 
presents Mr. Nixon as asking Mr. 
Dean about Watergate, and the latter 
assuring the President that the White 
,House wasn't involved. 
Point withdrawn 
How far afield these two were is 
Indicated in a matter not discussed in 
the new chronology: Mr. Nixon told 
the nation, for example, that Mr. 
Dean had submitted a written report 
clearing the White House on Water-
gate. Mr. Dean denied submitting 
such a report, and the White House 
withdrew the point. 
In the White House version of 
affairs (as condensed by the Ervin 
staff) there are repeated entries "the 
President asked Dean point-blank" 
(about Watergate) and was told no 
White House involvement; the Presi-
dent called Dean that night (March 
20) and "Dean said 'There was not a 
scintilla of evidence' "of White House 
complicity.

ecounts 
By David S. Broder 
Weehinaton Poet Staff Writer 
In his Senate testimony 
yesterday, former presiden-
tial counsel John W. Dean 
III drew a picture of a pre-
election White House neu-
rotically concerned with the 
presence of anti-Nixon dem-. 
onstrators and morbidly fas-
cinated with gossip and in- 6 
telligence about the Dem-
ocratic opposition. 
Others who worked there 
.and In the Nixon campaign 
said In interviews yesterday 
that Dean's description 
matched" their own recollec-
tions. 
But Patrick J. Buchanan, 
then and now a consultant 
to the President, said there 
had been "a real diminution 
of concern" by the time of 
which Dean was speaking, 
compared to the atmosphere 
in 1969 and early 1970. 
"I don't think there was 
paranoia," Buchanan said. 
Dean did not use the word 
"paranoia" in his testimony, 
but he told the Senate 
Watergate investigators that 
he found "a climate of ex-
cessive concern over the pce 
Mimi. impact of demonstra-
tors, excessive concern over 
leAks, an insatiable appetite 
for political intelligence, all 
coupled with a do-it-yourself 
White House staff, regard-
less of the law." 
Dean called the break-in 
at Democratic headquarters? 
an "inevitable outgrowth" of 
this climate, and said it was 
also responsible for such ae-
tions as: 
? A threat by former pres-. 
Idential aide Dwight Chapin 
"to get some 'thugs' to re-
move" a single demonstra-
tor the President had spot-
ted in Lafayette Park. 
?An order by the Presi-
dent, using "some rather 
blunt synonyms," for the Se-
cret Service to remove a 
group of demonstrators in 
Akron, and a request from 
the President, just last 
March, for a speech to be 
drafted showing that "his 
opponents had employed 
demonstrators against him 
in his re-election campaign." 
? A" all from Richard G. 
Kleindienst, then deputy at-
torney general, instructing 
c Dean to carry from the FBI 
to the White House "some 
very important information" 
of a "rather sensitive nature 
. . . regarding the foreign 
travels of Mary Jo Ko-
pechne," the young woman 
killed in an auto accident In-
volving Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy (D-Mass.). 
? The dispatch from the 
White House to Chappaquid-
dick Island, site of that cv? 
dent, of special inves 
Anthony Ulasewicz, who, 
Dean said John Caulfield 
told him, was on the scene 
"within six hours of the ac-. 
c en " and posed as a re-
porter to dig out informa-
tion on the case. . 
? A proposal from presi-
dential aide H.R. (Bob) 
Haldeman; rejected as too 
dangerous, that Kennedy be 
kept under surveillance 24 
hours a day. 
? A special investigation, 
of Kennedy's activities dur-
ing a .24-hour stopover in 
Hawaii on a 1971 Far East-
ern trip. 
? And the delivery, dur-
ing the spring of 1972, by "a 
top man at the Secret Serv-
ice" of information regard?
ing Democratic presidential 
contender George McGov-
ern, which then White 
House aide Charles Colson 
"was very interested" in and 
"had ... published." 
White House press secre-
tary Ronald Ziegler de-
clined to commentS on 
Dean's testimony and most 
others mentioned by Dean 
were unavailable to report-
ers. 
Jack Warner, a spokesman 
for the Secret Service, said 
it had begun an internal in-
vestigation of the charges 
that Secret Service agent 
protecting McGovern were 
reporting back to the White 
?House, at the time those 
charges first appeared, last 
November, in The New York 
Times. 
Neither then or later, he 
said, "have we found any-
thing to bear out these elle-
gations. Our investigation is 
continuing." 
Colson, in a separate in-
terview, acknowledged re, 
ceiving the report from 
Dean but said he had -not 
,been able to get it pub-
lished, "because no one 
.could ever check it out." He 
'saki the report concerned "a 
fund-raising affair McGov-
ern attended in Philadel-
phia, where the fellow in 
charge had a questionable 
background." 
Colson said Dean "just 
walked in with it, and never 
said where it came from. It's 
very characteristic of what 
Dean did throughout his tes-
timony yesterday?laid off 
his own sins on others, and 
did it cleverly." 
Colson said he had been 
interviewed about the case 
by the Secret Service and 
had told them the same 
thing. Asked if he now be-
lieved the report came from' 
the Secret Service, Colson 
said, "Well, Dean said it was 
from the SecretService, and 
the& ova *alp 
hite House 
Kennedy's press secretary, 
Richard Drayne, said the 
senator was unaware of any 
White House surveillance, 
or of the activities of Ula-
sewicz at Chappaquiddick. 
Drayne said Kennedy told 
him yesterday he knew 
nothing of any foreign trav-
els by Miss Kopechne nor of 
any reason why his visit to 
Hawaii should have been, of 
White House interest. 
The report to the White 
House on Kennedy's visit to 
Honolulu on Aug. 17, 1971, 
submitted by Dean to the 
Senate committee, is very 
bland. 
It said Kennedy held an 
airport press conference, 
left with two friends and 
made no public appearances 
except for a tennis game. 
"Discreet inquiry deter: 
mind that Kennedy used 
the estate (where he was 
staying) solely for sleeping 
purposes, took only his, 
breakfast meal at that loca-
tion and quietly :visited 
friends at other locations on 
the island . . . An extensive 
survey of hotels, discreet 
cocktail lounges and other 
hideaways was conducted 
with a view towards deter-
mining a covert EMK 
(Kennedy) visit. The results 
were negative," the report 
said. 
In his statement yester-
day, Dean said that "it was 
not until I joined the White 
House staff in July of 1970 
that I fully realized the' 
strong feelings that the 
President and his staff had 
toward antiwar demonstra-
tors?and demonstrators in 
general." 
He said the White House 
continually sought informa-
tion that would discredit the 
,demonstration leaders, show 
that they were backed "by 
some foreign enemy" or had 
ties to some "major political 
figures, specifically members 
of the U.S. Senate, who op-
posed the President's war 
policies." 
Dean said that in the late 
winter of 1971 "the Presi-
dent happened to look out 
the windows of the resi-
dence of the White House 
and saw a lone man with a 
large 10-foot sign stretched 
out in front of Lafayette 
Park." 
He said Larry Higby, a 
Haldeman aide, "called me 
'to his office to tell me of 
the President's displeasure 
. . . and told me that Mr. 
,Haldeman said the sign had 
to come down." 
Leaving Higby's office, he 
met Chapin, "who said that 
he was going to get some 
'thugs' to remove that man 
08/CirFattaMDF'17404:1 
with help from the Secret 
Service and the Park pollee,. 
'persuaded the man to move, 
'to the back side of the park,' 
"out of sight from the White 
'House," 
Haldeman, he said, "was 
.delighted." 
Only three months ago, he 
said, Mr. Nixon himself told 
him that "as a part of the 
planned counter-offensive 
,for dealing with the Senate 
Watergate investigation, the 
President wanted to show 
that his opponents ' had 
employed demonstrators 
,against him during his re-
election campaign." 
The problem, said Dean, 
was that "we never found a 
scintilla of viable evidence 
indicating that these demon-
strators were part of a mas-
ter plan . . . funded by the 
Democratic political funds, 
nor that they had any direct 
,connection with the Mc-
Govern campaign." For that 
reason, he said, William Ba-
roody was never able to 
write the speech the ,Presi-
dent wanted on the subject. 
"This was explained to 
Mr. Haldeman," Dean said, 
"but the President believed 
that the opposite was true." 
Dean's view of a White 
House neurotically preoccu-
pied with the4hreat of dem-
onstrators was contradicted 
by Buchanan, who had been 
a close adviser to Mr. Nixon 
. for the past seven years. 
"There was a great deal 
more apprehension here in 
1969 and at the time of Cam-
bodia and Kent State," he 
said, "than in any subse? 
quent period. By the time 
we were moving into the 
campaign?and certainly at-
ter the May. Day demonstra-
tions in 1971?there was a 
real diminution of concern. 
For one thing, every time a. 
demonstration occurred, it 
was politically helpful." 
Dean's Statement to the 
committee yesterday dif-
fered in tone from his de-
scription of the same situa-
tion in a reports he com-
posed last March, before his 
forced resignation from the 
White House. That March 
statement was also enterea 
In evidence yesterday. 
In both statements, Dean 
referred to White House dis-
satisfaction with intelli-
gence reports on the demon-
strators. In March he said 
that "when Haldeman would 
read the reports regarding 
demonstrations be would ? 
and rightly so ? express 
continual dissatisfaction." 
12R0001.0041/000t1'e7 evidence
t)rovift said he dissuaded him and, would appear that the dem-
3 
Approved For Release 2001/08/07 : CIA-RDP77-00432R000100180001-7 
' onstrations were well-or-
chestrated' and well-fi-
nanced," he wrote then, "no 
one could ever find hard in-
formation as to who was be.
hind it and what motivation 
might exist, other than the 
obvious antiwar theme." 
Back in Mardi, he sug-
gested two reasons why the 
President might be rightly 
concerned with the demon-
stration problem: "First," he 
sold, "it made the atmos-
phere of public opinion 
much more difficult for the 
President to negotiate an 
honorable peace in Vietnam, 
and, secondly, when the gov-
ernment dealt firmly with 
the demonstrators, we 
would be charged with op-
pressive tactics even though 
the demonstrators ? were 
seeking to tie the govern-
ment into, knots." 
Interviews with three for-
mer White House and cam-
paign aides, on the other 
hand, iwought support for 
the view of a White House 
,preoccupation with security 
,and polilieal espionage, 
which Dean described yes-
terday. 
One former campaign 
aide said Dean's testimony 
yesterday "rang very true. 
We all learned that what 
pleased them most was a 
tidbit hey could pass on to 
-Haldeman. That would get 
? you rewards. Every one of 
us felt the need to supply 
that kind of information." 
He recalled that hs far 
back its.. Mr. Nixon's 1962 
. campaign for Governor of 
California, Haldeman, who 
was then the campaign man-
ager and others "were so 
desperately afraid of letting 
.Nixon see any hostile dem-
onstrators that we had to or-
ganize groups of kids to . 
lock arms and keep them 
away." 
A second man, a former 
White House official, said, 
"It all goes back to his (Mr. 
Nixon's) problem with hav-
ing the unexpected happen. 
'It's part and parcel of that. 
His staff learns to go to any 
'length to protect him from 
something for which he is 
not prepared." 
A third man, now also re-
tired from the White House, 
said "I never got the feeling 
that Nixon himself or the 
lop staff guys?the ones at ? 
the 7:30 meeting ? were 
,that upset with the demon-
strators. 
"But I always had the 
feeling that the reaction ac-
celerated , as it went down 
the chain of command, and 
frequently by the time it hit 
the third or fourth guy, it 
was completely out of con-
'trot. There was a lot of it 
with the guys who worked 
for Haldeman. Colson, Chip 
pin and tl..e deep-down un-
derlings of (John) Ehrlich-
man ? Boy Scout stuff."

Ex-Counsel Also Names 
White House Assist ants
;REcAus wARNING 
Declares He Told the 
President Episode 
Was 'a Cancer' 
h 
By JAMES M. NAUGHTON 
? ? Special to The New York TImes 
WASHINGTON, June 25 
John W. Dean 3d, asserting 
that President Nixon had failed' 
to heed a warning that the 
Watergate case was '"a cancer 
growing on the Presidency," 
? testified today that the Presi-
dent had taken part in the 
Watergate cover-up for as long 
as eight months. 
Mr. Dean, the dismissed 
White House legal counsel, told 
'the Senate's investigating com-
mittee that he still clung to a 
belief that Mr. Nixon "did not 
realize or appreciate at any 
time the implications of his in-
volvement." 
Nonetheless, in a day-long, 
matter-of-fact recitation of Mr. 
Dean's own involvement in the 
Watergate cover-up and in 47 
documents that he submitted to 
the Senate committee, he de-
scribed a widespread effort to 
mask the extent of the con-
spiracy that he said spread 
from the White House staff, the 
Committee for the Re-election 
of the President; the Depart-
ment of Justice and, ultimately, 
to the oval office of the White 
House. 
245-Page Account 
His head bowed as he read 
calmly from a 245-page pre-
pared account, Mr. Dean pub-
licly detailed for the first time 
the following allegations of Mr. 
Nixon's own involvement: 
oriThe President complimented 
him last September for having' 
helped to assure that the Gov-
ernment's investigation of the 
Watergate case "had stopped 
with [G. Gordon] Liddy," One 
of the convicted Watergate 
conspirators. 
(11n February, the President 
asked him to report directly to 
Mr. Nixon on what he learned 
of the continuing investiga-
tions because H. R. Haldeman 
and John D. Ehrlichman, the 
two senior domestic aides to 
the President, "were principals 
In the matter," and also meet-
ing with Mr. Dean was taking 
up too much of their time. 
4 
Approved For Release 2001/08/07 : CIA-RDP77-00432R000100180001-7 
? 
gThe President discussed 
with him on March 13 the de-
mands by the Watergate con-
spirators for large sums of 
money to maintain their silence 
and that when Mr. Dean told. 
him it could cost more than 
$1-million, Mr. Nixon "told me 
that was no problem." 
liThe President had told him 
of discussions early this year 
with Mr. Ehrlichman and 
Charles W. Colson, a former 
Special counsel to the Presi-
dent, about a promise to grant 
executive clemency to E. How-
ard Hunt Jr., another of the 
Watergate defendants. 
liThe President directed that 
the Administration try to cur-
tail the Senate investigation 
and block an attempted in-
quiry into Watergate by the 
House Banking and Currency 
Committee last September. The 
President also ordered aides to 
make sure that L. Patrick Gray 
3d, the former acting director 
of the Federal Bureau of In-
vestigation, would be "pulled 
up short" in his testimony last 
spring to the Senate Judiciary 
Committee. 
tlAt? one point, in a meeting 
on March 21, the President 
discussed with his aides the 
possibility that the cover-up 
might be kept secret if John N. 
Mitchell, the former Attorney 
General and director of Mr. 
Nixon's re-election campaign, 
could be persuaded to assume 
publicly responsibility for the 
burglary and wiretapping of 
the Democratic headquarters at 
Watergate a year ago. 
tlAfter he (Dean) had re-
solved to try to "end the mess 
without mortally wounding the 
President" by giving informa-
tion to Government prosecu-
tors, the President apparently 
tape recorded an April 15 meet-
ing with him and asked a num-
ber of "leading questions" in 
an evident effort to create a 
record that would "protect 
himself." 
filThe President tried to get 
him, in a "tense conversation" 
on April 16, to sign two letters 
of resignation that tended to 
Incriminate Mr. Dean, but he 
"looked the President squarely 
in the eyes and told him I 
would not sign the letters" or 
become a "White House scape-
goat." 
On Stand 2 More Days 
Mr. Dean's recital to the 
Senate Select Committee on 
Presidential Campaign Activi-
ties consumed the entire hear-
ing today. Members of the com-
mittee will interrogate him to-
morrow and Wednesday and 
they plan to call Mr. Mitchell 
as the next witness on Thurs-
day. 
Mr. Dean did not provide any 
firsthand information to link 
the President to prior knowl-
edge of the Watergate burglary 
and the arrests of five men 
inside the Democratic National 
Committee offices. But he told. 
. in a fourth-hand account, of 
having been advised in Febru-
ary that Mr. Haldeman had 
"cleared" with the President 
Liddy's $250,000 master plan to 
gather information on the Dem-
ocratic opposition in the 1972 
campaign. 
Furthermore, he said he was 
told last Nov. 15 by Mr. Halde-
man and Mr. Ehrlichman that 
Mr. Nixon had decided he must 
obtain the resignation of Dwight 
L. Chapin, the former White 
House apopintments secretary, 
because of Mr. Chapin's in-
volvement with Donald H. Se-
gretti, the alleged director of a 
broad campaign of sabotage of 
Democratic Presidential candi-
dacies. 
Reports Burglary Order 
The former White House 
counsel said that another aide 
to Mr. Ni::on, Egil Krogh Jr., 
had told him on March 29 that 
the authority for a September, 
1971, burglary of the office of 
a psychiatrist treating Dr, Dan-
iel Ellsberg had come "right out 
of the oval office," 
Mr. Dean's account was the 
first before the Senate com-
mittee to accuse Mr. Nixon cat-
egorically of involvement in 
the cover-up. He sat alone at 
the witness table, his wife, 
Maureen, and his lawyers 
seated one row behind him, to 
dramatize what he had said last 
week was the loneliness of his 
plight in making accusations 
about the President. 
He acknowledged to the 
committee?before which he 
appeared only after obtaining a 
grant of partial immunity from 
prostcution?that he had been 
involved himself in "obstruct-
ing justice," arranging for "per-
jured testimony" and in making 
personal use of $4,850 of cam-
paign funds. 
As he began his appearance 
before the Senators, Mr. Dean 
said that he hoped that when 
all the facts were known "the 
President is forgiven." He apol-
ogized for havin gto describe 
illegal acts of "friends" and of 
indidivuals he said he admired, 
!but he went on to recount, 
calmly, without passion and in 
;narrative form, the involvement 
of several score Government 
and campaign officials in the 
Watergate case. 
According to Mr. Dean's tes-
timony, the effort of the Nixon 
Administration to limit the in-
vestigation of the Watergate 
break-in to those immediately 
arrested and to cover up any 
involvement of White House of-
ficials in surveillance op-
erations against the Democrat-
ic National Committee and 
Democratic Presidential candi-
dates began within two days of 
the June 17 break-in. 
Furthermore, as Mr. dean 
described a succession of meet-
ings, the cover-up involved all 
those whose names have so far 
figured in the accounts that 
have dribbled out of testimony 
before the grand jury and in 
interviews with Federal prose-
cutors, staff lawyers of the 
Senate select committee and 
prior testimony before that 
Approved For Release 2001/08/07 : CIA-RDP77-00432R000100180001-7 ? 
committee. 
In his testimony today, Mr. 
Dean implicated in the cover-
up Mr, Haldeman, Mr. Ehrlich-
man, Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Stans, 
Mr. Colson; Mr. Gray, Mr. Mae-
dian, Mr. Petersen, Mr. Kalm-
bach and a host of other of-
ficials at the White House and 
the Committee for the Re-elec-
tion of the President. 
i Dean's Story 
, This, in brief, is the story 
'Mr. Dean told today of the 
mounting efforts, at times ap-
proaching the frenetic, to pre-
vent the Investigation of the 
Watergate episode from engulf& 
lag the White House: 
Landing in San Francisco on 
June 18, 1972, from Manila, 
Mr. Dean said, he learned of, 
the break-in in a call from Fred 
Fielding, his assistant, and im-
mediately departed for Wash-
ington. 
1 He said that on Monday, the 
19th, he had a succession of 
meetings and telephone con-
versations with Jack Caulfield, 
then with the Treasury; Jeb 
1Stuart Magruder deputy di-
;rector of the reelection com-
mittee, who volunteered that 
th whole think was "all Liddy's 
fault:" Mr. Ehrlichman, who. 
told him to find out what he 
could; Mr. Strachan and Mr. 
Colson, the latter assuring him 
that he had "no involvement 
In the matter whatsoever" but 
expressing concern about "the 
contents" in the safe of E. 
Howard Hunt Jr.; G. Gordon 
Liddy, who said Mr. Magruder 
"had pushed him into doing it" 
And apologized for his men be-
ing caught, and Attorney Gen-
'eral Kleindienst, who said the 
F.B.I. and the District of Co-
lumbia police were investi-
gating. 
The most important develop-
ments on that day, he related, 
were (1) that Mr. Strachan 
said to Mr. Dean that Mr. Hal-
deman had instructed him to 
winnow the Haldeman files of 
"damaging materials" such as; 
"Wirefax information from thei 
DNX" and destroy them, and 
(2) that Mr. Ehrlichman ordered 
Mr. Dean to "call Liddy to have 
him tell Hunt to get out of the 
country." and also to remove 
the contents of Hunt's safe.. 
At Mitchell's Place 
On the evening of the 19th 
or 20th, Mr. Dean said, he went 
to Mr. Mitchell's apartment. 
Mr. Mardian and Mr. Magruder 
were there, and Mr. Dean te-
called only that there was a 
discussion of "how to handle 
the matter from a public rela-
tions standpoint." 
At a meeting with Mr. Klein-
dienst?Mr. Dean could not 
remember whether it iwas the 
19th or the 20th?he said, "I 
told him that I did not know 
if the President was involved, 
but I was concerned" because 
if the investigation led to the. 
White House "the chances of 
re-electing the President would 
be severely damaged." , 
At this point, Mr. Dean re-
lated, Mr. Kleindienst sent for 
1Mr. Petersen and left the two 
1 men together. 
"I told him 1 hadmibli,W. p 
where this thing mijaff 'ea,' 
Mr. Dean said, "lout I told him 
I didn't think the White House 
could withstand a wide-open 
investigation [and] I had rea-
son?without being specific 
with him to suspect the 
worst." 
? At mid-morning of June 20, 
he said, men from the Govern-
ment Services Administration 
who had opened Hunt's safe 
brought the contents to him. 
He said the contents included 
a hand 'gun; a large briefcase 
containing electronic equip-
ment; a large batch of classi-
lied State Department cables 
from the early years of the 
Vietnam war, a "bogus cable" 
Implicating the Kennedy Ad-
ministration in the fall of the 
Diem regime in 1963; "a num-
ber of materials relating to 
Daniel Ellsberg," who made the 
Pentagon study of the Vietnam 
war available to the' press; 
"some materials relating to an 
investigation Hunt had conduct-
ed for Colson at Chappaquid-
dick," and many memoran-
dums to Mr. Colson on the per-
formance of the ."plumbers 
unit" under Egil Krogh Jr., 
White House aide, that had 
been formed on the President's 
'orders to investigate leaks., 
Separating Documents 
Mr. Dean said that, on his 
orders, Mr. Fielding separated 
out' the "politically sensitive 
documents" which were then 
placed in Mr. Dean's safe. The 
'briefcase was put in a locked 
closet in his office, he said, and 
the State Department docu-
ments stored in an aide's of-. 
'fice pending their return to the 
department. 
Later, he said, when he re-
ported to Mr. Ehrlichman on 
the contents of Hunt's safe, 
Mr. Ehrlichman told him "to 
shred" the bogus cable, the 
documents relating to Dr. Ells-
berg and other politically sensi-
tive material, and to "deep six" 
the briefcase with the electronic 
equipment. Then, Mr. Dean 
testified: 
"I asked him what he meant 
by 'deep six.' He leaned back 
in his chair and said, You drive 
across the river on your way 
home at night, don't you?' I 
said yes. He said, 'Well, when 
you cross over the bridge on. 
your way home, just toss the 
briefcase into the river.'" 
Mr. Dean said that he sug-
gested to Mr. Ehrlichman that 
he get rid of the bugging equip-
ment since he also crossed the 
river. "He said, no thank you," 
said Mr. Dean. 
Decided Not to Obey 
He said he was "very trou-
bled" about Mr. Ehrlichman's 
instruction, and Mr. Fielding 
shared his feeling that it would' 
be "an incredible action to 
destroy potential evidence.". 
Therefore, he said, he decided 
not to follow the instructions. 
. On June 21, he stated, he 
met with Mr. Gray, who told 
him the F.B.I. had traced four 
'checks totaling $89,000 con-
tributed by a group of wealthy 
Texans to a bank in Mexico 
City, and a $25,000 check to 
Kenneth Dahlberg, a Nixon 
middle Western fund raiser, 
ickdativetteitemOn 
from ayne n p reas. 
wealthy Minneapolis business-
man who had been 'a long-time 
backer of Senator Hubert H. 
,Humphrey. The total of $114,000 
had turned up in the Miami 
bank account of Bernard L. 
Barker, one of the Cubans ar-
rested ? in the Watergate break-
in. 
' Mr. Dean said that Mr. Mit-
chell and Mr. Stans were con-
terned that Mr. 'Andreas not 
be embarrassed and were wor-
ried about the four Mexican 
checks, possibly, he said, be-
cause they might have been 
liegel corporate contributions. 
Mr. Dean said that Mr. Stens 
had asked Hugh W. Sloan Jr., 
the campaign treasurer, how 
the money ended up in Barker's 
account. Mr. Sloan had ex-
plained that he had given the 
Checks to Liddy to cash, and 
Liddy had evidently "used 
Barker to cash them." 
Explaining that this money 
was unconnected with Water-
gate, Mr. Mitchell and Mr. 
Stans, Mr. Dean said, asked 
him "to see if there was any-
thing the White House could 
do to prevent this unnecessary 
embarrassment." 
Therefore, he said, he talked 
to Mr. Haldeman and Mr. 
Ehrlichman, and at their re-
quest went to see Mr. Gray on 
June 22. Mr. Gray, he said, had 
one theory that- Watergate 
might have been "a C.I.A. 
operation" because of the 
former C.I.A. employes: in-
volved and planned to talk to 
agency officials about it. He 
also, Mr. Dean said, "expressed 
his awarenesS of the potential 
problems" for the ? administra-
tion in the F.B.I. investigation. 
Mr. Dean said that on June 
23 he reported on his confer-
ence with Mr. Gray to Mr. 
Haldeman, Mr. Ehrlichman and, 
in a meeting with Mr. Mitchell, 
Frederick C. LaRue, an aide to 
Mr. Mitchell, and Mr. Mardian. 
It was in this meeting, he said, 
that he first heard discussion 
of "the need for money to tnke 
care of those who were in-
Volved in the break-in." 
? It was at the June 23 meet-
ing, he said, following his re-
port that Mr. Gray believed the 
C.I.A. might be involved, that 
Mr. Mardian suggested the 
C.I.A. "could take care of this 
entire matter if they wished." 
Role for C.I.A. 
Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Dean said, 
suggested that he explore with 
Mr. Haldeman and Mr. Ehrlich-
man "having the White House 
contact the C.I.A. for assist-
ance." By this, apparently, Mr. 
Mitchell meant that the agency 
should assume responsibility 
for Watergate by paying those 
apprehended to keep silent.. 
Mr. Ehrlichman, Mr. Dean 
testified, thought Mr. Mitchell's 
suggestion "a good idea" and 
ordered Mr. Dean to explore it 
with Lieut. Gen. Vernon A. 
Walters, the C.I.A. deputy di-
rector, rather than the director, 
Richard Helms.

NEW YORK TIMES 
26 JUNE 1973 
Dean Says White House 
Put a 'Friend' in C.I.A. 
? By MARJORIE HUNTER 
? SOretal to The New York Ti 
WASHINGTON, June 25 ? 
John W. Dean 3d testified to-
day that he had been told by a 
top Nixon aide that the White 
House had put its own "good 
friend" into the Central Intelli-
gence Agency in order to "have 
some influence over ? the 
agency." 
That !'good friend," Mr. 
Dean told the Senate Watergate 
committee,' is Lieut. Gen. Ver-
non A. Walters, Deputy Dir-cc 
tor of the C.I.A. and frequent 
interpreter for President Nixon 
on foreign trips. 
This latest disclosure of . 
alleged White House efforts to 
involve the C.I.A. in domestic 
' activities came amid increas-
ing demands by Congress for 
tighter control over the top 
secret agency. 
Within the last few weeks, 
former and present officials of 
the C.I.A. have trooped to 
Capitol Hill in unprecedented 
numbers to he questioned for 
hours at a time upon the 
agency's role in the Watergate 
affair. 
Out of these harings by both 
Senate and House committees 
and subcommittees have come 
startling revelations of C.I.A. 
cooperation with the White 
House on strictly domestic ope-
rations?a field that its own 
charter would? seemingly rule 
out of bounds. 
And out of these hearings 
have come equally stunning ac-
counts of While House efforts 
to enlist C.I.A. aid in covering 
up the Watergate scandals. 
Mr. Dean's testimony today 
supported earlier accounts by 
General Walters and other 
C.I.A. officials of White House 
efforts to get the agency to 
shoulder the blame for the 
break-in at the Democratic Na4 
tional Committee headquarters 
In the Watergate complex last 
June 17. 
At the same time, the Dean 
testimony appeared to shed 
light on what had been a pub-
licly unanswered question: Why 
had the White House passed 
over Richard M. Helms, at that 
time Director of Central In-
telligence, to negotiate almoqst' 
solely with his deputy on, the 
Watergate matter? 
Mr. Dean testified that, a 
few days after the Watergate 
break-in, L. Patrick Gray, then 
acting Director of the Federal 
.Bureau of Investigation, sug-
gested to him that it might 
have been a C.I.A. operation 
because of the number of for-
mer agency people involved. 
Mr. Dean said that he later 
told John D. Ehrlichmann, the 
President's domestic affairs ad-
viser, of Mr. Gray's suggestion 
and hat Mr. Ehrlichmann told 
him to call the agency and ex-
plore the matter. 
"He then told me that I 
should deal with General Wal-
ters because he was a good 
friend of the White House and 
the White House had put him 
in the Deputy Director position 
so they could have some in-
fluence over the agency," Mr. 
Dean testified. 
Assurance for Ehrlichman 
Mr. Dean said he later in-
formed Mk Ehrlichman that Ge 
eral Walters had assured him 
that agency involvement in the 
Watergate was impossible: 
Mr. Dean said that Mr. 
Ehrlichman responded by say-
ing "something to the effect, 
that General Walters seems to 
have forgotten how he got 
where he is today." 
, A spokesman for the CIA, 
',said that General Walters 
!would have no comment on the 
Dean testimony. 
j Shocked by these and other 
:disclosures, Congressional crit-
ics and supporters alike are 
now calling fcir stern measures 
to assert firmer control over 
the agency. , 
Won House Approval 
Just last week, the first move 
to curb C.I.A. activities came 
with House approval of a ban 
on agency assistance to do-
mestic law enforcement agen-
cies. The Senate has not acted. 
The provision, sponsored by 
Representative Elizabeth Holtz-
man, Democrat of Brooklyn, 
was promoted by disclosures 
that agency employes had been 
training police officers in New 
York City and other cities in 
clandestine activities. 
Mike Mansfield, Democrat of 
Montana, the Senate majority 
leader, plans to renew his un-
successful drive of many years 
ago to establish a joint Senate-
House committee to oversee 
operations of the CIA, and 
.other Government intelligence 
agencies. 
1 
Senator' Stuart Symington, 
Democrat of Missouri, the act-
ing chairman of the Senate 
Armed Services Committee, has 
said that he will conduct a full-
scale investigation of the evolv-
ing "secret charter" under 
which the agency has operated 
since its establishment 25 years 
ago. 
There are also proposals to 
revise ? the agency's basic law 
either to outlaw domestic 
operations specifically or to re-
quire that any such domestic 
involvement be permitted only 
upon the personal request of 
the PreSident. 
The National Security Act of 
1947, under which the intelli-
gence agency was created, was 
designed to prohibit it from 
conducting domestic operations 
by stating that it "shall have 
no police, subpoena, law-en-
forcement or internal security 
functions." 
But the act also contains two 
major loopholes: 
First, it gives the Director of 
Central Intelligence the respon-
sibility of "protecting intelli-
gence sources and methodc 
from unauthorized disclosure." 
Second. the act gives the 
agency authority "to perform 
Approved 
such other functions and duties 
relating to intelligence" as the 
National Security Council, an 
arm of the Presidency, "may 
from time to time direct." 
Furthermore, secret eXecu-
tive orders, interpreting the Na-
.tional Security Act, have been 
,issued through the years, cre-
atting what some call the 
'C.I.A.'s "secret charter,"- mew 
the target of Senator Syming-
ton's planned investigation. 
While earlier efforts to assert 
greater Congressional control 
over the C.I.A. were success-
fully blocked by successive Ad-
ministrations, the recent dis-
-closures in the Watergate affair 
have stunned Congress. 
Cushman Agreed 
Among the disclosures were 
the following: 
gin the summer of 1971 Gen. 
Robert A. Cushman, at that 
time deputy director of the 
agency and now commandant of 
,the Marine Corps, agreed to a 
White House request to supply 
E. Howard Hunt Jr. with a wig, 
false identification papers and 
other items later used in burg-
larizing the California office of 
Dr. Daniel Ellsberg's former

agency and now Ambassador to 
Iran, agreed to another White 
House request for preparation 
Of a psychological profile of Dr. 
Ellsberg, who was later indicted 
for leaking the secret Pentagon 
papers on American involve-
'trent in Southeast Asia. 
(11\4r. Helms and General 
Walters, the deputy director 
of the agency, have told of 
Mr. Ehrlichman, two of Presi-
dent Nixon's top aides, to per-
suade the agency to halt an 
.inquiry by the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation into Nixon re-
election campaign funds thatrj 
were channeled through a Mex-
ico City hank to hide thei 
source. Some of these funds , 
were found on the persons of 
the men caught breaking into 
the Democratic National Corn:-
mittee headquarters. 
()General Walters also has 
told of efforts by Mr. Dean to 
get the C.I.A. involved in a 
futher cover-up of the Water-
gate affair by asking the 
agency to pay ball and salaries 
for thhe jailed burglars.

formally implemented. 
The highly touted docu-
ments, including eight me-. 
mos released in full and the 
sanitized version of another 
document, show that plans 
were formulated for domes-

show no implementation of , 
potentially illegal opera-
tions. 
The documents show that 
former White House intelli-
gence aide Thomas C. Ilu-' 
ston and Dean continued to 
formulate plans for domes-
tic security after July 28, 
1970, when Mr. Nixon said 
the:plans were rescinded. 
In testimony yesterday be-
fore the Watergate commit-
tee, Dean said, however, 
that he knew of no illegal 
operations that grew from 
the plans or from the later 
establishment of an Intelli-
gence Evaluation Committe6 
to coordinate efforts of ex-
isting government intelli-
gence agencies, Including 
the FBI. CIA, and Defense.

In an interview yesterday, 
Iluston said that he contin-
he knew of no operations 
that grew out of the plan. 
The Huston memos to 
then-White House chief of

White House to review the 
plan and delay implementa-
tion. 
Huston continued to push

Aug. 5, Aug. 7 and Sept. 10, 
1970, but said yesterday that 
the language in the memos 
is "optimistic," as if the plan 
had not been killed in hopes 
of getting Haldeman's sup-
port, which he said he never 
got. 
In a September 18, 1970, 
"top secret" memo released 
yesterday, Dean wrote to 
then Attorney General John 
N. Mitchell to suggest 
"procedures to commence 
our domestic intelligence 
operation as quickly as pos-
sible." 
This was about two 
months after the basic do-
mestic intelligence plan au-
thorizing wiretapping, 
break-ins, mail cover and de-
velopment of sources on col-
lege campuses had been res-
cinded. 
In the memo Dean said 
that there should be no 
"blanket removal of restric-
tions" on such illegal opera-
tions as there was in the ini-
tial, rejected plan. In: his 
testimony yesterday Dean 
said the memo led to the es-

"At some point, Hoover'.

ticularly true with regard to.

That memo continues: 
"The biggest risk we 
could take, in my opinion, 
to continue to regard the vi-
olence on the campus and in, 
the cities as ? a temporary. 
phenomenon . . . I believe, 
we are talking about the fu-
ture of this country, for 
surely domestic violence 
and disorder threaten the' 
very fabric of our society." 
"For eighteen months we3 
have watched people in this 
government ignore the Pres-
ident's orders, take actions. 
to embarrass him, promote 
themselves at his expense,. 
and generally make his job' 
more difficult. It makes me.

Hoover is doing here is putting:

say that Attorney General'

rity plan. 
The top secret memos dei:, 
scribing the basic intelli-

June 7 by The New York,

Washington Post. 
Those documents showed: 
that President Nixon ap-? 
proved the expanded intelli- ?

being warned by Hustoui 
that parts of it were "clearly 
Illegal" and involved "seri-
ous risks" to his administrie 
tion if the operations ever, 
became known. Because or' 
affair. 
Further, in a long colloquy 
with Senator Joseph M. ? Mon-
toya, Democrat of New Mexico:* 
Mr. Dean disputed each of a, 
Series of Presidential explana-
tions of' the Watergate- bur:, 
glary, describing them as mis-
leading, unfounded or overly 
"broad." 
Crucial Conflict Seen 
Mr, bean's steadfast adher-
ence today to the accusations 
contained in the 245-page 'state-
ment that he read yesterday to 
the Senate Select Committee on 
Presidential Campaign Activities 
posed an immediate?and po-
tentially crucial?conflict with 
the White House. 
In San Clemente, Calif., 111 
nearly the same time that M. 
Dean was disputing a string Of 
Presidential statements on Wat-
ergate, a spokesman at the 
Western White House said that 
Mr. Nixon would stand on the 
May 22 statement disavowing 
any participation in the plan-
ning of the Watergate break-in, 
or the subsequent cover-up. 
; His Word Against Nixon's ' 
Mr. 'Dean acknowledged, dur-
ing rambling cross-examination 
by the Senate panel, 'that he 
was in the position of present-
ing his word, as a 34-year-ol4 
deposed White House lawyer, 
iagainst that of the President. 
? But he insisted that his only 
motive in testifying was to end 
Ihis personal involvement in the 
cover-up and, to respond to the 
Committee's request for his 
knowledge of it. 
"What makes you think that 
your credibility is greater than 
that of the President, who de-
'pies what you have said?" Sen-
ator Herman E. Talmadge, 
Democrat of Georgia, asked Mr. 
Dean. 
"Well, Senator," Mr. Dean re-
plied, his elbows propped *top 
the felt-covered witness tible,' 
"I have been asked to come up 
here and tell the truth. I have. 
told it exactly the way I know 
It.,, 
Differences With Nixon 
? The way Mr. Dean told it. 
presented clear and sharp dis-
crepancies with the public' 
record of Mr. Nixon's Water-
gate' statements, and Senator 
Montoya proceeded late today 
to explore the ,conflicts. ? 
? The Senater asked Mr. Dean 
to appraise Mr. Nixon's state-
ment, at a news conference last 
Aug. 29, that a "complete in-
vestigation" by Mr. Dean had. 
cleared everyone in the White 
House of involvement in the 
June 17 break-in at the Water-
gate. ? 
Taken literally, Mr. Dean 
replied, the statement that no 
.one employed in the White 
:11Vglillariltelirr2b1129:11?? 
7 
might have been true, but he 
said that the flat assertion 
"was a little broad." 
Similarly, Mr. Dean told Sen-
ator Montoya that he had not 
provided any 'basis for the 
President to declare, last Oct. 5, 
that the. Watergate investiga-
tion conducted by the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation had 
pursued every possible lead "to 
the end." 
Mr. Dean said that "It was 
true that the F.B.I. investiga-
tion was extensive, but it ob-
!Piously was not complete." 
No Report From Dean 
The former legal counsel to 
Mr. Nixon said that he was also 
"quite aware" that the Presi-
dent had never received a re-
port on Watergate from Mr., 
Dean when the President said, 
on March 17, that Mr. Dean 
had undertaken such an in-
vestigation. 
The most direct rebuttal of 
the President by Mr. Dean 
occurred during Senator Mon-
toya's inquiry into an April 17 
assertion by Mr. Nixon that he 
would "condemn any attempts 
to cover up in this case." 
"Do you believe he was tell-
the truth on that date?" 
asked Senator Montoya. 
' "No sir," Mr. Dean replied 
crisply.
* T Senator and the witness 
discussed for several minutes 
Mr. Dean's point-by-point quar-
rel with the President's May 
Z2. statement. Mr. Dean said 
he' had no "first-hand knowl-
edge" to rebut Mr. Nixon's dis-
avowal of prior knowledge of 
the break-in, but he went on 
at great length to recount, as 
no had yesterday, Mr. Nixon's 
alleged involvement in the 
aover-up. 
A Shift on Peterson 
Under close questioning by 
;red D. Thompson, the com-
mittee's Republican counsel, 
!dr. Dean backed down today 
,rom his suggestion yesterday 
that Henry E. Petersen, an As-
sistant Attorney General, had 
lcted improperly when he was 
in charge of the Government's 
Vatergate investigation. 
Mr. Dean flatly declared that 
Ronald L. Ziegler, the White 
tlouSe press secretary, had not 
een told the truth about 
Watergate and thus had not 
aeliberately misled the media 
during the 10 months in which 
he denied any White House 
involvement in the case. 
But Mr. Dean, in response 
10 interrogation, added new 
;barges today of efforts with-
al the Nixon Administration 
to use investigative agencies 
improperly. 
He testified that the White 
House maintained, and con-
stantly updated, an "enemies 
list" of individuals unfriendly 
to the Administration. Mr. Dean 
promised to submit to the corn-
mittee a memorandum he had 
written about possible uses of 
the list, 
Tax Audit for Writer 
He charged that after the 
publication in Newsday, the 
Long Island newspaper, of an

have some problems" with the 
Internal Revenue Service. Mr. 
Dean said that he had arranged 
for the writer, whose name he 
could not recall, to be sub-
jected to an income tax audit. 
? He stated that an official of 
? the Secret Service, whom Mr. 
Dean did not identify, had. 
given him a "small intelligence 
:printout" alleging that Senator 
George McGovern, the 1972 
, ,Democratic Presidential. nomi-. 
nee, would attend a fund. 
raising function in Philadelphia 
at which "either Communist 
money or former Communist. 
? supporters" would be involved! 
He said that he passed the 
Item to Charles W. Colson, a 
former White House 'special 
? counsel, who told him he ar-
ranged to have it published. 
Mr. Dean also alleged that 
Frederick V. Malek, the former 
White House personnel admin-
istrator who now is deputy di-
rector of the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget, had not been 
truthful in accounting for a 
background investigation con-
ducted by the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation on Daniel 
Schorr, a Washington corre-
spondent for the Columbia 
Broadcasting System. 
Questions on Monologue 
Mr. Dean said ? as Mr. 
Schorr, who is reporting on the 
Watergate hearings, looked on 
?that he had learned "after 
the fact" that H. R. Haldeman, 
the former White House chief 
of staff, had ordered the inves-
tigation through Lawrence M. 
Higby, who was Mr. Haldeman 
deputy. 
Mr. Dean said that J. Edgar 
Hoover, then the F.B.I. director, 
had pursued a "wide-open" 
field investigation, "to the dis-
may of the White House," and 
that Mr. Malek, "who at the 
time knew nothing of this,'.' 
subsequently explained that 
Mr. Schorr was under consid-
eration for a key position with 
the Administration. 
The bulk of Mr. Dean's first 
day of questioning by the Sen-
ate committee?he will return 
for more questions tomorrow?
dealt with the credibility of his 
long monologue yesterday, in 
which he described the partici-
pation of the President, the 
White House, the Committee 
for the Re-Election of the Presi-
dent, the Department of Justice 
and assorted individuals in a 
"massive" Watergate cover-up. 
With almost stoic repose, Mr. 
Dean sat barely an inch away 
from the public address and 
television microphones in the 
hearing room, placidly replying 
to questions that alternately 
appeared to bolster or try to 
poke holts in his earlier testi-
mony. 
He told Samuel Dash, the 
committee's Democratic chief 
counsel, that, in' his opinion, 
Mr. Haldeman would have been 
advistd in advance of the plans 
to wiretap the Democratic 
party offices in the Watergate 
office complex last year and 
that Mr. Haldeman "probably 
would have reporttd it" to the 
President. But Mr. Dean balked 
later when Mr. Dash sought to 
elicit his "opinion" as to 
'whether Mr. N ixon had 
probably been advistct by aides 
of the cover-up at its incep-
'tion. ? 
The former lawyer for Presi-
dent Nixon agreed with Mr. 
Dash's leading questions, in 
which the committee counsel 
suggested that from last Sept. 
15 on. Mr. Dean had no doubt 
about the participation of the 
President in the cover-up ef-
fort. 
Executive Clmency Cited . 
Mr. Dean testified yesterday 
that on Sept. 15 the President 
congratulated him on his ef-
forts to guarantee that Federal 
Indictments in the Watergate 
case handed down that day had 
not reached any but the seven 
individuals first arrested. 
He also described yesterday 
a series of conversations with 
the President about arrange-
ments fpr executive clmency for 
one of the Watergate defend-
ants, about "silence money" to 
assure that the original de-
fendants would not talk and 
about Mr. Nixon's direction of 
efforts to curtail Congressional, 
,Government and cout investiga-
tions of the case. 
The tone of ?Mr. Dean's per-
sistent declarations today that 
he had told the truth was set 
In this exchange with Mr. Dash: 
Mr. Dash: I guess you are 
fully aware, Mr. Dean, of the 
gravity of the charges you have 
made under oath against the 
highest official of our land, the 
President of the United States. 
Mr. Dean: Yes, I inn. 
Mr. Dash: And being so 
aware, do you still stand on 
your statement? 
Mr. Dean: Yes, I do. 
Unshakeably, Mr. Dean main-
tained the same position 
throughout the interrogation. 
He explained that he had waited 
until April 15 to begin telling 
what he knew to Government 
prosecutors because "I was 
hopeful the President himself 
would step forward and tell of 
his involvement in some of 
these things?' 
'Almost Impossible Task' 
He said that he realized that 
the 47 documents he submit-
ted to the Senate committee 
yesterday did not deal directly 
with his conversations with the 
President and that he had no 
evidence to support his asser-
tions. 
"I realize," Mr. Dean stated, 
"it is almost an impossible 
task, if it is one man against 
the other, that I am up against, 
and it is not a very pleasant 
situation. But I can only speak 
what I know to be the facts 
and that is what I am provid-
ing this committee." 
Some of the sharpest inter-
rogation of Mr. Dean was con-
ducted, after the fashion of the 
former prosecutor that he once 
was, by Mr. Thompson. 
Asked how he became in-
volved in the cover-up, Mr. 
Dean said, "I was in the proc-
ess before I began thinking 
about the process." 
At one point, Mr. Thompson 
apologized if he appeared to be 
"badgering you in any way" 
as he explored the possibility 
that Mr. Dean had offered his 
testimony in hope of gaining 
immunity from criminal prose-
cution. 
"In fact," Mr. Dean said, a,

Documents Give Insight 
On White House Efforts 
By ANTHONY RIPLEY 
SIMC1411 to The New York Times 
' WASHINGTON, June 26 --' 
i 
The documents that John W. 
Dean 3d submitted with his 
'testimony before the Senate 
Watergate committee give a 
rare insight into the White 
tHouse and related 1972 Pret.i-
idential campaign activities. 
1 There are glimpses of Pres-
idential attitudes and fears of 
'news leaks and demonstrators. 
There are the thoughts and 
plaws of those who served the 
President. . 
There are conversations over 
the handling of campaign funds. 
There is the reluctance of 
James W. McCord Jr. to go 
along with part of the cover-up 
of Watergate. 
There is the penetration of 
Representative Paul N. McClos-
key Jr.'s rival campaign. 
There is even the attempt to 
keep the Senate hearings them-
selves under control and a 
number of other points in the 
still unfolded scandals. 
In all, Mr. Dean submitted 
50 documents to back up his 
written testimony of 245 pages. 
Excerpts Given 
Following are excerpts from 
some of the documents gath-
ered by Mr. Dean, who served 
for almost three years as Mr. 
Nixon's counsel until his dis-
missal April 30: 
A memorandum from Gordon 
Strachan to his boss, H. R. 
Haldeman, then the White 
House chief of staff, undated 
and dealing with news leaks: 
"It would he helpful to real-
ize that there are five distinct 
types of leaks: only some of 
these are deterrable. The types 
include: A) the August SALT 
[Strategic Arms Limitation 
bit bitingly, to Mr. Thompson,' 
"if I were still at the White 
House I would probably be 
feeding you the questions to' 
ask the person who is sitting 
here." 
Mr. Thompson retorted, "If 
.were here, as I am, I would 
have responded that I do not 
need questions to be fed to me 
from anybody." 
Nonetheless, it was Mr. 
Thompson who elicited from 
Mr. Dean the statement that 
Mr. Dean had not meant to 
imply yesterday that Mr. Peter-
sen had acted unethically in 
providing information to the 
White House about the scope 
and conduct of the Govern-
ment's inquiry into the Water-
aate case last year.g 
"I know of no impropriety," 
Mr. Dean said of Mr. Ptersen's 
dealings with the White House. 
"I think he tried to be very 
fair?in dealing with the White 
House and that fact that we 
had an investigation going on 
in a political year, that it could 
result in embarrassment on 
Approved Far Release 2001/08/07 : ClAclinDtlOs7c-Vainii0001001 
Talks] leak prompting the lie 
detector tests at State. The in-
dividual consciously violated 
the law to protect his own view 
of national interest?non-deter-
rabic; 
' "B) The September SALT 
(accidental war agreement) 
leak: too many individuals (all 
of Congress and our NATO 
allies) knew and so the informa-
tion is not controllable?non-
deterrable; 
"C) The self-serving leak 
which ?strengthens the individ-
ual policy position by acquiring 
public support before the final 
decision is made---deterrable; 
'D) The ego-stroke leak 
Where the Individual eithec 
wants to see his name in print 
or to be known as one with 
influence?deterrable; 
"And E( the careless leak 
resulting from . either a slow 
individual with information and 
a foot reporter or too much 
liquor--deterrable." 
Monthly Reporting Plan 
The memo stated that 11 
cases for "possible Haldeman 
action as 'Lord High Execu-
tioner' to stop leaks" had been 
studied but that none had been 
acted upon. A monthly report-
ing plan, ith investigations and 
use of politically loyal person-
nel, was put into action with 
the approval of Mr. Haldeman. 
In another of the memors, 
a long one drawn up this year 
at Camp David, Mr. Dean at-
tempted to review how a dom-
estic intelligence program that 
came to disaster in the Water-
gate burglary on June 17, 1972, 
had begun. 
He said officials had been 
very concerned about the 1972 
Republican national conven-
tion, fearing that it might ex-
plode in violence, as had the 
1968 Democratic convention. 
I told HRH (Mr. Haldeman) 
that we would push the Federal 
intelligence agencies to keep 
is informed, but I doubted if 
,ve would get much better in 
Itelligence than we had. In 
Ishort, I was instructed to assist 
;the re-election 'committee in 
preparing itself for expected 
'intense demonstrations. 
"I discussed this matter with 
Mr. Hoover (the former direc-
tor of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, J. Edgar Hoover) 
approximately ? trio date: 
given), and he agreed that we. 
would have a problem, that4 
the F.B.I. would help but that 
the re-election committeed 
should develop its own capacity*. 
to gather such intelligence. He 
offered to provide names of 
former agents that might be 
of assistance but I never asked ' 
him for such names." 
Instead, the White House' 
developed its own campaign 
intelligence team headed by G. 
Gordon Liddy. Mr. Dean said. 
Liddy was convicted at the

Message by McCord 
After the Watergate burglars 
were caught and indicted, Mr. 
Dean said, McCord "was not 
cooperating with his lawyer" 
and alleged plans for blaming' 
the Central Intelligence Agency? 
, for the break-in were not work. 
ing. 
McCord sent the following 
message to John J. Caulfield, a. 
former White House aide: .? 
"Dear Jeck: 
"I'M 'softy to have to wriW 
you this letter but felt you had 
to know. 4,.? 
"If HelniS [Director' of Cen-
tral Intelligdnce Richard Helms]. 
.goes and the Watergate opera., 
tion is laid at C.I.A.'s feet$ 
where it does not belong, every:, 
tree in the forest will fall. ? , 
, "It will be a scorched desert... 
,The whole matter is at the 
precipice now. 
"Just pass the message that 
if they want it to blow, they; 
are on exactly the right course.' 
"I'm sorry that you will get; 
hurt in the fallout." 
McCloskey Incident - 
On Dec. 11 and 12 an "opera-
political intelligence gathering 
scheme "penetrated' Repre-
sentative McCloskey's . Wash. 
ington campaign headquarters, 
Mr. Dean memorandums show. 
At the time the California 
Republican was opposing Mr. 
Nixon in the Presidential' 
primaries. 
The , "operative" found little 
money, few volunteers and al-
most everyone gone off to New 
'Hampshire, according to- 
'ports that went from Mr: Caul-
field to Mr. Dean toJohn N. 
Mitchell, then the Attomek 
General and later campaign 
manager for Mr. Nixon. 
In late February this year, 
Mr. Dean prepared the Presi-
dent for a meeting with Sena-
tor Howard H. Baker Jr., Re-
publican of Tennessee and vice 
chairman of the Senate Water. 
,gate committee. 
. Among Mr. Dean's sugges-
tions on a briefing paper. were 
to "take Baker's pulse and find 
Out how much he wants to help 
keep this from becoming a 
political circus. 
"If Baker appears to be truly. 
desirous of cooperating ?and 
the fact he is seeking guidance 
may so indicate?he might be 
told that there are matters un-
related to the bugging incident 
per se (E. G. Segretti, Kalm-
bach) that could be embarrass-
ing and tarnish good people 
whose motives were the high-
est," the memo said.

Ni,xon Plans 
To .Answer,'
_ 
Lard Says. 
Bitl David S. Broder 
Washington Post Staff Writer 
president Nixon is willi-
ing to respond to "all ques-
tions" 4out his role in the 
Watergate affair after the 
major wTtnesses have given 
their stoOes to the Senate 
Investigating committee, the 
new White House domestic 
counselor, Melvin R. Laird, 
said yesterday. 
In an interview with The? 
Washington Post, the for-
Mer Defense Secretary said 
Mr. Nixon would not 
"respond to every witness" 
but would answer, "ques-
tions, all questions . . . at a 
press conference, "when we 
get near the conclusion of 
the hearings." 
Laird said he had dis-
cussed the timing of a press 
;conference with the Presi-
dent and "I think he's will-
ing to do that . . . I don't 
think there will be any prob-
lem with that." 
Laird also strongly sug-
,gested that despite his re-
,cent elevation on the White 
' House staff, Ronald L. Zie-
gler will be replaced as the 
President's principal press 
spokesman by his current 
deputy, Gerald L. Warren. 
"I have an appreciation 
for Ron's problem," Laird 
said. "I'm convinced he 
, didn't ?knowingly mislead 
? (the press). But from the in-
. formation I've been able to 
get, I think it's good to have 
t some other press spokesman 
,for a while. 
r? "Sometimes people are 
'caught up in a series of cir-
cumstances where you have 
to make certain changes. 
And I think those changes 
'will be made. I don't think 
'you have to make a big an-
nouncement over something' 
like that." 
Ziegler, recently desig-
nated as an Assistant tp the 
President as well as press 
,.secretary, has been under 
fire from press groups for 
providing inaccurate inform-
ation to its reporters during 
the period of the Watergate 
. crime and alleged White 
House cover-up. 
. Former White House 
counsel John W. Dean III 
has testified this week that 
Ziegler was rehearsed by 
other White House staff 
meinbers for his press brief-
trigs on Watergate and was 
repeatedly deniedknowl-
edge of what; really had 
taken place. , 
,Laird said Ziegler's expe-
rience showed 1, that 
"anybody who's going to 
Approved FtlektbkagrAtitfoiroiP 
9 
every meeting." 
??"I think 'that can be 
changed," he said, referring 
'to:the shteldinrof the press 
secretary from vital knowl-
edge. ' "I ? think Jerry 
(Warren) ha's tO take over 
that responsibility, and I 
hope he can. I'm not sure, 
'but I hope that he can," 
' ? (In San Clemente, Calif., a 
White House official, said 
that Ziegler will continue in 
'his responsibilities as out-
lined when Mr.' Nixon ele, 
vated him to the, position 
esSistant to the. Presiden) 
earlier this Month. 
? (At that 'time, the Presi-
dent said that Ziegler also 
'would continue as press sec-
retary. 
("The observation that 
Ziegler's usefulness is im-
paired is not shared by the 
President," the official saidl 
?(He said that the Presi-
*dent is contemplating a gen-
eral .press, conference "at 
some point." But the Presi-
dent has not decided when 
it will be, the official said.) 
In a wide-ranging inter-
view in the ?west-wing White 
House office he has taken 
over from his resigned pre-
cedessor, John D. , Ehrlich-
man, Laird also said: 
? He is cutting back the 
Domestic Council staff he 
Inherited from Ehrlichman 
and trying to shift decision-
making to the Cabinet de-
partments,.but running into 
resistance from congress-
men and bureaucrats who 
don't want to act "unless 
they get White House guid-
ance." 
? He has asked first-term' 
domestic councelor 'Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan, now am-
bassador to India, to suggest 
!Nays of res 
dving the family 
issittance welfare reform 
plan abandoned by Mr. 
Nixon this' year after an un-
three-year three-year effort 
for congressional passage. 
:-.??? He is doubtful that the 
,President's expressed : wish-
to scrap controls and return 
to a free economy can be ac-
in the face of a 
"very difficult" worldwide 
'food shortage, but acknowl-
edged that the temporary 
;freeze of market prices it-
self is "causing some prob-
lems" of future food supply. 
Recalled to government 
service early this month in 
the wake of the Watergate 
scandal, the former Wiscon-
sin ? congressman and De-i 
fense Secretary seemed 
more subdued than custom-, 
ary in an hour-long Inter-
view. 
Asked about the mood of 
the White house and the 
President. Laird paused for 
a long moment and said: 
"Well, of course, this is a 
tough period for the Presi-
dent. No question about 
that. Rut I have the feeling 
... that morale about getting 
C RCP lia-66402R00040 0 1 
ernint -it has improved." 
Laird paused again, and 
said: "You're talking to me 
In one of the most difficult 
weeks, as far as the past is 
concerned, that I can think 
of. But If didn't feel that 
we could move forward and 
get some of these programs 
working, I wouldn't be 
here." 
The new presidential ad-
viser said one of the 
"pluses" from the Watergate, 
may be that "the operations 
o the Executive Branch will 
be strenghtened." 
"We just have to open this 
place (the White House) up," 
he said,"but it's not, easy to 
do. There's been a tendency 
on the part of people to con-
centrate everything in the 
White House and the White' 
House staff. The situation 
has to be switched back, so 
the departments and the 
line agencies really have the 
staff to do the work and 
can carry on their consulta-
tions with the governors, 
the mayors and the con-
gressmen on their own pro-
grams." 
Laird said that "its going 
'to take a little time to 
change" habits, after years 
of centralized decision-mak-
ing, because "there is a 
tendency among some mem-
bers of Congress to like hay-
ing one place to call, rather 
than going to the depart-
ments, and there is a tend-
ency on the part of some of 
the departments not to 
make a decision or specific 
recommendation unless they 
get White House guidance." 
To counter that habit, 
Laird said, he had been vis-
iting a different Cabinet de-
partment almost every day 
since taking his job. "I don't 
ask them to come here," he 
isaid. "I go there. I try to 
.make it clear to each of the 
Cabinet officers that he is 
going to be responsible for 
the department, for the peo-
ple he's putting into jobs, 
and that they're going to be 
responsible to him. You 
can't have any Cabinet offi-
cer in a position where he 
doesn't have complete trust 
and faith in the people who 
are working,for him." 
Second Laird said, he is 
trying to stimulate closer 
consultation between the de-
partments and members of 
Congress. 
Laird himself has taken 
advantage of his privilege as 
gress and. has appeared on 
.the floor of the House se-
veral times In the last three 
weeks, engaging in long con-
ferences with former col-
leagues.

Senate Panel Investigating Watergate

yollowing are excepts froth a 7, 
;transcript of the testimony 
on the 14th day of hearings 
on ,the Watergate case today 
before ? the Senate Select , 
Committee On Presidential'. 
.   
campaign activity:c  
? MORNING 
SESSION 
? 
John W. Dean 3d 
SENATOR ERVIN: We have 
!two very peculiar questions 
which have been addressed to 
the committee, apparently by 
Mr. J. Fred Buzhardt, special 
counsel to the President. The 
first question addressed to 
the committee by Mr. Buz-
,hardl is this: ? 
? "Did you and your counsel' 
'develop a strategy for ob-
',taining immunity from prose-
'cution? What were the ele-
ments, of that strategy?" 
On behalf of the commit-Et, 
'tee, I would reply to Mr. 
Buzhardt that the only strat-
gy we developed was to' 
'pursue the course outlined by 
the act of Congress codified 
'as Sections 6002 and 6005 of 
Title 18 of the United States. 
Code. 
The second question Is this 
?this is to the committee?
the second question is: "Didn't 
your strategy include delib-
erate leaks of information to, 
the media on what you had 
told investigators? Maybe this 
is addressed to Mr. Dean, I, 
do not know. 
It is probably addressed to 
Dean. 
Well, Mr. Dean, I will ask 
you these questions ? well, 
maybe I had just better let 
us proceed in orderly fash-
ion. am sorry I misconstrued 
the. question. 
I might state these were 
:just handed to me about one 
second before I read them 
and I drew the inference, 
? sinee the questions were sep-
arated as they were, some of 
'them were addressed to the 
' committee rather than the 
'Witness. 'But perhaps I am 
'Mistaken in that but I would 
'say that the only strategy 
this committee, has followed 
,lto secure immunity for any 
witness has been to pursue 
:the law strictly. 
Now, on yesterday the wit-
'ness was asked to produce 
some exhibits and I. just 
'Wanted to ask him if he had 
provided them. 
DEAN: Yes, I did. These 
.are from a file that le entitled 
Opponents List and Political 
Enemies Project. 
? Back to the Beginning 
I,. SENATOR GURNEY: We 
:have had a great deal of tes-
faimony, 245 pages of your 
statement as well as the tes-
timony yesterday. and Imust 
say it is, hard to know where 
ito, begin in all this. think 
probably the best place to 
,start always is at the begin-
Ihing. Would you say that it 
hi fair to say that Gordon 
Liddy's plan of hugging and 
,electronic espionage really 
started out the whole Water-
gate affair? 
' --A. Well, there was an at-
mosphere that might have 
r been Several precursors 
.source to that plan. The plan 
lavas an accident of fate 
!where they culminated into 
Mr. Liddy's pecific poposal 
that was presented in the 
'Attorney General's office in 
the two meetings which oc-
reurred in late January and 
early February. 
Q. But as far as the Water-
gate break-in itself is con-
'cerned, it really stemmed 
frean Mr. Liddy's plan of 
bugging and electronic es-
pionage, ? did it not? Now, 
'Who recommended Mr. Liddy 
'to' the committee to re-elect 
Ithe President? 
A. I passed on a recom-
tnendation that I had received 
from Mr. Krogh to Mr. Mitch-
'ell and he in turn, endorsed 
'that recommendation and 
rsent him over to the re-elec-
tion committee. 
'0 Q. Did you interview Mr. 
itiddy after Krogh recom-
mended him to you? 
1. A. Not to my recollection, 
.tid. I was present when he 
1Was interviewed by Mr. Mitch-
ell and again when he was 
lInterviewed by Mr. Magruder. 
'Q. Did you ask any ques-
itiOns about his qualifications 
:at that time or did Mr. Liddy 
'Jost simply answer questions? 
A. I asked Mr. Krogh abdut 
;hit qualifications at that time 
'when he first mentioned him 
to me. And they asked ques-
tions during those interviews, 
'Yes. 
Q. Did you ever ask him ? 
'What he had been doing for 
Mr. Krogh? Or Mr. Hunt? 
,A. No. I did not. 
Liddy's Qualifications 
'Q. Would that not be im-
portant in finding out his 
qualifications, his previous 
employment? 
A. Well, I was told. for 
?example, when I met him?
when I talked to Mr. Krogh 
about him. I can recall Mr. 
'Krogh very specifically tell-
ing me that he had written 
some of the best legal memo-
,randurns that he had run 
across in a long time. He ex-
'plained that Gordon had taken 
some rather complex subjects 
.and analyzed them in a very 
precise way. One of these 
memoranda had gone in to 
the President and the Presi-
dent had complimented Mr. 
Liddy through Mr. Krogh on 
'the quality ef the document 
;that he had prepared. , 
Q. Was it under that part 
of his duties would he in 
charge of security or things 
like that? A. That is correct. 
Q. Well, did you ask any 
questions of him as to what 
he had been doing in the area 
of security? 
A. I was told that he had 
an F.B.I., Treasury Depart-
ment, law enforcement back-
ground. There was not a 
great focus on that at that 
time. I knew Mr. Krogh had 
worked in the past 'before I 
came to the White House. 
and partially after, I was still 
at the White House with the 
demonstrator problem. 
Q. You never did go into 
what he had been doing with 
Krogh and Hunt? A. No, I 
did not. 
Q. The Jan. 27 meeting 
occurred and as I recall, you 
testified that the original plan 
?and I do not know what 
the word was that you used 
to describe it, but? A. I 
think I called it a "Mission 
Impossible" plan. 
Q. Did you ever talk to 
Mr. Mitchell or Mr. Magruder 
after this horrendous plan? 
A. As I recall, the only con-
,- versation I had was a very 
brief conversation. Mr. Liddy 
was taking the charts off the' 
easel and they were preparing 
to leave the office when I 
paused in front of Mr. Mitch-
ell's desk and he told me that 
this was certainly out of the 
question. 
Plan Caused Worries 
Q. well, did it worry you 
that this man came up with 
kidnapping, prostitution, mug-
ging, and all the rest of it? 
A. Yes, sir, it did. 
Q. But you never really 
discussed it with Mitchell 
and Magruder as to Liddy's 
capability of staying on at 
the job? A. Well, sir, you 
would have had to have been 
there to believe it and I 
might say that it was so far 
Out that there was no hope 
in my mind that anyone was 
ever going to approve any 
plan like this. So I just as-
sumed that it was going to 
die a natural death. 
Q. Now we come to the 
second meeting that occurred 
on Feb. 4. My recollection al-
. 
so is that you testified that 
you were again very dis-
turbed at what he was pro-
posing. A. That is correct and 
I was injecting myself into 
the meeting in an effort to 
terminate the meeting, whicht 
I did. 
Q. Well, did you have any: 
discussion after the meeting 
with Mr. Mitchell and Mr., 
Magruder about his contin-
uing? 
A. I had a direct discussion: 
with Mr. Liddy at that time. 
I might add, after the first. 
meeting. I had told Mr. Liddy 
he should destroy the charts.' 
After the second meeting, as 
we were leaving the office, I, 
told him that I would not dis-; 
cuss this with him any fur-
ther, I' indicated to him that 
it still was not what was nec-
essary, and it was a rather. 
' brief discussion. I must say 
I felt very sorry for Gordon 
Liddy during much of this be-
cause of the fact that he had 
received no guidance from 
anybody that I .could tell?
certainly none from .me?as 
to what was expected of him. 
Q. Was what you testified 
that you told him that he 
was never to discuss this 
thing again with you, that if 
any plan was approved like 
this that you did not want to 
know atiout it? A. That is 
correct. ? 
Reported to Haldeman 
Q. Why did you not go 
back to the President and tell 
him about this hair-raising 
scheme? A. Well, I did go 
back, but I did not have ac-
cess to the President, as I 
think I explained. I went to 
Mr. Haldeman. 
Q. Did you try to gain ac-
cess to the President? A. Sen. 
ator, I did not try. I had 
never been into the Presi-
dent or called by the Presi-
dent before. My reporting 
channel was through Mr. 
Haldeman and I went hack 
and told what I thought was 
the proper reporting channel. 
I told him what I had seen, 
told him my reaction to it, 
told him that I thought it was 
unwise, unnecessary, and Mr. 
Haldeman agreed with me. 
Q. Did you ever discuss 
after this meeting with Mr. 
Mitchell and Mr. Magruder, 
whether this plan was going 
to be implemented or what-
ever happened to it? 
A. I never heard about the 
plan again until. as I have 
testified, Mr. Liddy came 
into my office some time In 
February or March?I do not 
know the precise date?and 
told me that he could not get 
his plan approved. I reminded

him- that I was not going to 
; talk ? with him about it, and 
, he said that he understood 
. and he did not talk about it. 
Q. Did you ever report that 
to the President? 
. A. No, I didn't, sir. 
Q. Now, to get back to 
, the break-in 'at the Water- ' 
gate, as I recall your testi-
mony, there really wasn't 
anything in Watergate or 
, much of anything i?he 
activities surrounding the 
? committee to re-elect the 
President from that Feb. 4 
meeting until the Watergate 
Break-in. And I understand 
you got back from the Philip-' 
, pine Islands on the 18th1and 
? then returned here to Wash-
? ington and went in your 
office on the 18th.' 
Then, as I recall, you said 
that you had received phone 
calls that day, and talked to 
a number of people--Caul; ' 
field, Magruder, Ehrlich-
man, Strachan, Colson, Sloan, 
and you later called Liddy 
"and Kleindienst. Why all 
these calls if you weren't 
that closely associated With 
? what they were doing over. 
there in the political field? ,? 
? 
Investigative Office , 
? A. Well, Senator, I would." 
Say that my 'office was one' 
that, one, I did have some' 
dealings with 'the re-election:1. 
committee, I did know all the 
parties involved. My office 
normally, was' asked to in'q 
vestigate or look into any-
problem that came up, of. 
that nature. When. any 
wrongdoing was charged-ran: 
Administration office, for ex- , 
; ample, when the grain deal 
came up?and I think as the 
Senator will recall, during 
the I.T.T. matter, my office 
had some peripheral involve-.? 
ment in that. And I believe ? 
we had some dealings with! 
you office on that matter.' 
Q. Not my office. 'I 'think 
we met in Senator Hruska's' 
office,' the Republican metn-(, 
bers .of the committee. A.. 
Well, Senator, I recall one 
time that Mr. Fielding and I, 
came lip to your office on the 
matter and Mr. Fielding pro-
vided some material for your!? 
staff. 
Q, What does that have to 
do with the Watergate? A. 
Well, I was explaining the; 
. type of thing that would 
come to my office and my of-
fice was a fire-fighting office 
and would get into various?
Q. Did you do other 
fire-
fighting before June 18th? 
A. Yes, sir. 
Q. At the committee' to re-
elect? A. Not to my knowl-
edge, no. That was the only 
fire I recall over there, and it 
' was the biggest one. 
Q. Now, then, you men-, 
tioned in your testimony yes-
terday in response to Mr.' 
Dash that you inherited the 
cover-up. Would you tell 
how you inherited the cover-
up? 
, A. When I came hack to. 
the office on the 18th and 
talked to Mr. Strachan, 
realized that the cover-up 
was already in effect, in be-
ing, and I realized that when, 
Mr. Strachan told 'me of the 
documents that he had de:' 
stroyed and Mr. Haldeman's 
instruction, that there cer-
tainly wasn't going to be a' 
revelation of the White, 
_ House involvement in the 
matter. I didn't at that point 
in time know the potentials 
of the White House involve; 
. ment. 
, Early Meeting Recalled 
Q. Was not one of the first 
meetings of the cover-up held 
.in John Mitchell's' apartment 
on the 19th of June? 
A. Senator, I would say 
that the day of, to my know-
day f the 19th at 
8: theWhite House was a very 
busy day. That the calls I re-
ceived from Mr. Ehrlichman, 
from Mr. Colson, the meet-
ings I had with Mr. Ehrlich-
man and then again later with 
Mr. Colson about the safe 
? were long before I went to 
the meeting at Mr. Mitchell's 
apartment, which I do not 
recall was on the 19th or 
20th. I do recall a meeting 
in Mr. Mitchell's office but I 
do. not recall specifically 
which day it was. 
Q. Well, what you are say-
? 
log is then that these several 
phone calls you had with all 
. of these people really had to 
do with at least the begin-
nings of the cover-up, is that 
'right? Well, you were 'in on it 
? from the beginning, were you 
not? A. Yes, sir. 
Q. You really did not in. 
herit anything. You were in, 
on the sort of hatching of it, 
were you not? Who set the 
policy on the cover-up? 
, A. I do not think it was a 
policy set. There was just 
no alternative at that point 
' in time. Q. Did you advise 
e, the President of .what was, 
going on? ; 
;..1 A.. Senator, the first time 
ever talked to the President 
was one occasion that I re-
call, before Sept.. 15th which 
was in late August. to the. 
best of my recollection, and 
, that certainly was not an 
occasion to talk to the Pres-
ident about anything because 
'his formet laie partners were 
? in the office, Mrs. Nixon was 
in the office, there were sev-
eral notaries or one notary 
? there, some other members 
of the staff and it had to do 
with the signing of the Pres-
ident's testamentary papers 
ia and it was?just was not a 
very appropriate occasion to 
,' even give a whisper to the 
t; President that I would like 
to talk to him. So I must say 
, ? that any time between June 
* ??19th and Sept. 15th I had no 
'conversations with the Pres-
ident. and nor did I approach 
,h the President at any time 
other than through reporting 
to Mr. Haldeman and Mr. 
, Ehrlichman. 
, Did Not Try to See Nixon 
' Q. Do you not think as the 
President's_ attorney, you 
should have tried to go to 
him and warn him about 
what was being done? A. I 
, probably should have but I 
was assuming everything I 
reported to Mr. Haldeman 
and Ehrlichman was also be-
jog reported to the !resident. 
? Q. 'Let us go and discuss' 
for a moment the F.B.I. re-
ports of the investigation.. 
Did you first go to Mr. Klein-
? dienst for these reports? A. 
e Right. I do not recall whether 
it was Mr. Kleindienst or Mr. 
Petersen that I first discussed 
? this with. 
Q. Who asked you to get? 
:the reports? A. Initially the 
I request came from Mr. Mitch- ; 
ell and I believe that was a 
result of Mr. Mardian's de-
sire to see the reports. Mr." 
e, Ehrlichman and Mr. Halde-
man thought it was a good.' 
idea that I see the reports, 
and had?rat vhat point in ' 
time I actually raised this 
with either Petersen or 
. Kleindienst my recollection . 
'? is I did talk to Mr. Petersen.:, 
,. about it at some time and he . 
suggested .1 go directly to 
Mr. Gray,. and I do recall dis-
'Cussing it with Mr. Gray. ; 
. Q. Let us get back to Mr. 
..Kleindienst. Are you sure you 
cannot recall whether you. 
ever talked to him about get-
ting these 302 forms? A. It is.: 
very possible, as I said, Sena- ? 
!tor, it is very possible I did. 
t Q. Well, do you recall if 
? you talked to Mr. Petersen? 
'What did you recall of that 
'conversation? A. I recall he, 
,suggested that I go directly 
.to Mr. Gray. 
? Q. ?Did either Mr. Petersen 
or Mr. Kleindienst or any-
body, according to your recol- ' 
lection, tell 'you that you ,1 
? could not get these F.B.I. re-
ports, that the President him-, 
self would have to get them? 
A. I was told that the best 
way to deal with this situa-
tion is go directly to Mr. 
Gray. 
' Q. Then, you have no, 
.recollection that the At-
torney General or Mr. Peter-
sen told you that you could 
:not have them unless you get 
them through the President? 
A. I do not recall it, frankly.:, 
Conversations With Gray 
Q. Well, then let's go to 
, Mr. Gray and your converse-, 
ttions with him. 
.. A. Mr, Gray told me that 
be thought that I could read 
them in his office, I told him 
thought that was,awkward, 
and when we discussed it, ' 
he wanted some Assurance 
that this information was be-
ing reported' to the President. 
As I recall, I gave him such 
an assurance. 
To the best of my recollec-
lion Mr. Gray said to me 
that, after I gave him assur-
ance it was going to be re-
ported, that he would work 
something out. Now I don't 
recall when I first received 
the initial reports. I only 
recall* that it was after a 
summary report ,was pre-
pared on the 21st of July, 
as I recall the date, and I 
showed that report to the 
people at the White House 
and the people at the re-
'election 'committee, that the 
pressure began that I let 
others read the raw F.B.I. 
reports. 
? Q. Let me get back again 
now to the conversation 
with Mr. Gray. Wasn't he 
pretty specific with you that 
4 
the only reason he would 
turn these things over to you 
is because the President of 
. the United States requested 
them through you? 
' A. Well, Senator, in my 
.dealings with Mr. Gray from 
the very outset was very 
anxious to be of any assist-
ance he could. 
When he told me, for ex-
ample, he was .traveling 
,around the country a lot and 
I should deal with Mark Felt 
that to me evidenced that 
Mr. Gray wanted to be of as-
sistance if he wasn't there I 
should talk to others. The 
same tenor was in the con-
versation that he would have 
to check and he wanted as-
surances these were going 
to the President, this infor-
mation would go to the 
President. I am sure he knew 
very well that the President 
didn't want to sit down and 
read a stack of raw F.B.I. 
materials. 
Q. Did you ever report to 
' the President what was in 
those 302 forms? A. There 
was never anything in those 
F.B.I. reports that I read 
worth reporting even to Mr. 
: Haldeman or Mr. Ehrlich-
man. 
82 F.B.I. Files ? 
Q. Did you ever show a 
? Single one of the 82,302 files . 
? to the President? Did you 
ever report a single informa-
tion that was in those files 
-to the President? 
A. Not to my recollection, 
no. I may have reported the 
general tenor of the investi-
gation which was, I might 
say, very vigorous. I would 
report that to Mr. Haldeman 
and Mr. Ehrlichman and as 
my channel of reporting. 
Q. Did you ever get a call' 
from Mr. Gray about this 
newspaper story about one 
of the reports being shown 
to Mr. Segretti? 
A. Well, I recall that when 
the story broke, Mr. Gray 
called me and asked me if 
that were true, and said 
absolutely not, that the FBI 
reports have never left my 
office and I have never 
showed an FBI report to Mr. 
Segretti which, in fact, is 
? true. 
Q. Who did you show them 
to? 
A. Mr. Mardian was anx-
ious to see them, Mr. Mitchell 
thought that was a good idea 
and also that Mr. O'Brien and 
Mr. Parkinson also come see 
them. They came to my of-
fice. I recall them scanning 
them. The only other occa-
sion I recall anybody else 
looking at the files is when 
Mr. Dick Moore who was 
special counsel to the Presi-
dent was given those docu-
ments to look at. 
Q. Now, as I understand 
it some material was turned 
over to the F.B.I. but certain 
materials were held out, is 
that correct? . What was 
turned over to Gray? A. Two 
envelopes containing sensi-
tive political documents. 
Q. That was turned over at 
a meeting in Mr. Ehrlich-
man's office, is that right? 
A. That is correct. You will 
recall I had been .instructed

Approved For Release 2001/08/07 : CIA-RDP77-00432R000100180001-7 
'to "deep-six" and shred docu-
ments. I had to come up in 
my own mind with a per-
suasive argument for Mr. 
.Ehrlichman as to why not to 
"deep-six" and destroy docu-
ments. 
Q. Now then what' trans 
Spired when they [the docu-
ments] were turned over? ' 
A: As I said, I took the' 
'documents and had a very 
brief discussion with Ehrlich-
It was pretty well under-
stood what the meeting was 
for, so it was not necessary 
to have any extended. dis-' 
cussion other than the, fact 
that the documents were 
, very politically sensitive, that ' 
'as I recall, I called them 
, political dynamite when I 
raised them with Gray, that 
he should take custody of 
them, and that would be the 
way to handle it as ?far as 
the White House was con-
cerned. I do not recall any 
discussion of telling Mr. Gray' 
to destroy the documents. 
He at that point in time, as 
? I recall, placed the documents. 
in a small sort of briefcase 
? and seemed quite willing- to 
take them. 
Spoke to Petersen 
Q. Did you ever ask hith 
again on any occasion what 
be had done with the docu-
ments? A. After I had dis-
closed this matter to Mr. 
Petersen, I recall that I was 
at luncheon at the Justice 
Department. This was prob-
'ably in early January. At 
'that time, Mr. Gray came up 
to me and sort of took me 
by the arm and said: "John, 
you have got to hang tight 
on not disclosing these docu-
ments." And? I said nothing 
to him. 
Q. Let us go to the August 
press conference, where the 
President referred to the 
Dean report. My understand-
ing is that you indicated 
,great surprise at this so-
called Dean report? A. That 
is correct. 
Q. Did you ever protest to 
the President? A. No sir, but 
others I did. I talked to Mr. 
Mitchell about it; I talked to 
Mr. Moore about it; I talked 
to my associate, Mr. Fielding. 
Q. Let's turn now to the 
,Sept. 15th meeting with the 
President and Mr. Haldeman 
and yourself. A. The Presi-
dent asked me to sit down 
and told me that Bob had told 
him what I had been doing 
and he expressed appreciation 
for it. 
Q. Did you discuss the 
criminal cases that were 
coming on for trial; the civil 
suits that were filed by the 
Democrats, the Common 
Cause suit that had been filed 
by Common Cause, the Pat-
man hearings? A. That is cor-
rect, we did. 
Q. Did you discuss any as- os 
pects of the Watergate at t 
that meeting with the Presi-
dent? 
A. Well, given the fact that h 
he told me I had done a good d 
job I assumed he had been c 
very pleased with what had m 
been going on. The fact that 
the Indictments, he we 
pleased that the indictmen 
had stopped at Liddy becaus 
the only other link into th 
White House was Magruder 
Q. Did you discuss wha 
Magruder knew about Water 
gate, the cover-up money 
Strachan bringing wiretap in 
formation into Haldeman, [or 
Haldeman Instructing Sta 
chan to destroy all of thes 
materials? A. No, I did not. 
a' roughly' five ancl it Came up 
ts to $4,850. put a check, 
e ? 'wrote a check out and put it 
e in, wrote it to cash, 
-,_ Q. Do you know this is a 
t 'crime, Mr. Dean? Isn't it em-
? ? bezzlement? 
' A. Well, I had very clear-
. 
- ly made, there was no in-
tention oft my part never to 
- : account for the full amount. 
e,, CHARLES SHAFFER: Ex-
cuse me I would like to 
say as counsel for Mr. 
Dean that, based upon the 
'fact that have been discussed 
with Mr. Dean, if they are 
true, Mr. Gurney says that 
'is embezzlement. I disagree 
with him, and I think there t 
are enough lawyers in the 
room to know what embez-1, 
ziement is. 
SENATOR GURNEY: As I 
recall, in the testimony there 
was discussion sometimes 
around November about a a 
written report that was to E 
be written by you on 
gate? A. a is correct. p 
t Q. Who requested that re- A 
port? A. It was Mr. Halde-', m 
s man. 
g , Q. Dili you ever write this , 
e, report? A. Yes, sir, and h 
have submitted that as a a 
document to the committee. w 
Q. Did ,you ever tel the th 
t , President about this report p 
or give him a copy of it? fo 
A. No, sir, I used my nor- th 
? mai reporting channels. 
Clemency for McCord 171 
Q. Well now how can you 
say that the President knew , 
all about these things from a 
simple observation by him 
that "Bob tells me you are,, 
doing a good job?" 
A. L was awaree of the fact 
that Mr. Haldeman had often 
made notes, Mr. Haldeman 
has a good memory. This was. 
the hottest issue that was', 
going in the campaign. I can't 
believe that the fact that we 
were going to contain this 
matter would totally escape 
the President's attention and, 
it was to me a confirmation 
and a compliment to me tha 
I had done this. 
Q. Did he say that "Bob ha 
been telling me everythin 
you have been doing." A. H 
said, "Bob has been reporting 
to me," something of this 
nafuo. 
Q.-I thought you said tha 
he said that "Bob has been 
telling me what a good job 
you have been tieing." A 
Well, we are quibbling ove 
words but I remember?
A. I had tried back as early 
as the second meeting, I be-
lieve, to tell him that felt 
that I was involved in an 
obstruction of justice, par-
ticularly after he had told me 
that I should report to hirn 
and made the comment to 
me that . Haldeman and Ehr-
lichman were principals. 
That stuck, in my mind so 
very clearly that I thought 
maybe he did not understand 
everything that I was doing. 
When I raised this with him, 
I gave him a few of the facts 
and he began to debate with 
ie about the fact that he did 
not think I had any legal 
problem based on what I WAS 
citing him and I, said I did. 
He did not vant to get into 
t at that time. 
Data on Later Meeting 
Q. Did you have a later 
rneeting ? with the President 
nd Mr. Haldeman and Mr. 
hrliohman? 
A. Yes sir. I went from the 
resident's office to a subse-
uent meeting with Ehrlich-
an and Haldeman and the 
iscussions began to focus 
n Mitchell coming down and 
aving Mitchell step forward 
nd if Mitchell stepped for-
ard and would account for 
is thing, then maybe the 
roblems that had followed

look at the bank statement 
,and tell the committee how 
'much money you had in the 
checking account at that time, 
Mr. Dean. 
$1,625.12, is that not cor-
'rect.? Yet, you put in your 
-file where you were Iteeping 
the money in trust a ,check 
for $4,850. 
?' A. That is correct. 
Q. Mr. Dean, we were dis- ? 
cussing the time lapse be-
tween those meetings with 
the President, the last meet-
ings on the 20th and 21st 
and 22d and your 'next corn-? 
.munication with him, whichl 
,was April 15, as I recall. 
' All of these meetings on. 
'the 20th, 21st, 22d, as I un-
.derstand it, they were the 
first meetings between what 
I would call perhaps the 
most principal people in-
:volved in Watergate, at least 
those in the White House, to 
.where you were coming to 
serious discussion about 
what ought to be done and ' 
.all of you realized that some-
thing certainly had 'to be 
done, and done rather fast,' 
,as I understand it? ? . 
A. 'I would not characterize"' 
'the meetings as to What had 
,to oe cione. In fact, the meet-
ings were, as I believe I de-
scribed them in my testi-
mony, very similar to many, 
many meetings I had oc-
curred, or I had been in ear-
lier where we talked about, 
you know, how do we deal 
with the Senate_committee, 
.the President at one point in:` 
the meeting picked up the 
'phone and called the Attor-
ney General and asked him , 
why. he had not been meet-
ing with Senator Baker. 
Q. Mr. Dean, finally, be-
fore wrapping up here, I 
would like to pin down the 
occasions this year prior to 
March 21st, the meeting with 
the President, when you and 
?he discussed the cover-up of 
Watergate. 
A. All right. It was the 
meeting on the 27th [Febru-
ary] that I had with the 
President when he told me to 
report directly to him. Well, 
also, I might add at the con-
clusion of that meeting, as 
we were walking to the door' 
'to "leave the office, he again 
complimented me on the fact' 
that I had done a good job 
during the campaign, that 
this had been the only issue 
that they had had, that they 
had tried to make something 
of it but they had been un-
able to make anything of it 
and he was very compli- , 
mentary of my handling of 
the job. 
He then told me we have 
t, you know, you have got 
to fight back on situations , 
like this. And I can recall 
something I cannot express? 
in.writing, a gesture when he 
sort of put his fist into his 
.hand and said, you have just 
got to really keeping fight-
ing back and I have got con-
fidence in you that you can ? 
do that and this thing will 
not get out of hand. ? 
I am now at the March 13 
meeting, where the matter 
of executive clemency and , 
the million dollars came up 
That would be the next in-
stance in the sequence. At 
MarCh 13, there was a num-
ber of unspecified demands 
for money that had come to' 
HOUSTON POST 
18 June 1973 
? 
me through Mr. O'Brien. I 
had also been having conver-
sations with Mr. Mitchell. 
So there was this general 
problem that was existing 
before the 13th of March as 
' the suport money and how It 
was going to get there, That 
.is what prompted me to raise 
',it with the President at the 
'end of the meeting, because 
? it was on my mind, and I told 
him that, you know, there 
were money problems, there 
was no money to pay these 
people and he said, "How 
much vill it cost?" 
I said, "My best estimate' 
? Is a million dollars or more." 
He asked me who the de-
mands were coming from. I i 
told him principally from Mr. 
Hunt through his attorney. 
At that point in time, he said 
something to the effect that, 
well, Mr. Hunt has already 
been given an assurance of 
clemency. 
He said, I talked to Mr. 
Ehrlichman about that and 
then Mr. Colson came and 
talked to me about it after 
he had been instructed not ' 
to talk to me about it. 
; Q. I am just trying to 
shortenit up. Did you d' 
cuss Watergate with him at 
all? A. Not specifically, no. , 
Q. March 17. You had a 
meeting that day? A. Yes, 
that was St. Patrick's Day, 
and I recall the President 
had a green tie on and sit- ' 
siting in the Oval Office. He.: 
was very relaxed and he had 
his feet up on the desk and i 
?was very ? the thing that 
stuck in my mind from that 
iparticular conversatibn was ' 
that he wondered if the Sen-
ate would bite the bait that 
he had put out at his press 
Behind The Secrecy 
The Central Intelligence Agency has operated 
for 25 years without much inspection by Con-
gress. The Federal Bureau of Investigation 
under the late J. Edgar Hoover went on for 
nearly a half-century without any substantial 
questioning in Congress. The secrecy that has 
shielded the two agencies from public informa-
tion or criticiim has left both open to the 
description of being akin to secret police ? 
something for which America presuislably had 
no room. 
Perhaps that will now be changed. Senator 
Symington of Missouri says he will lead his 
Senate Armed Services subcommittee in a thor-
ough investigation of the CIA. Representative 
Rndino of New Jersey, new chairman of the 
House Judiciary Committee, promises an in-
quiry into the FBI. 
. The reasoning of the two men is similar. 
,Revelations stemming from the Watergate af-
fair indicate that both agencies were compro-
mised by White House political control and 
could have been compromised further had Presi-
conference on litigating over 
the question of Dean and 
executive privilege because 
he was convinced if they did 
you would never see any of'' 
the White House staff before , 
the Senate. 
Q. Then, I think it is also 
true, at least, according to 
my understanding, -that dur-?'' 
ing the rest of the year 1972 ' 
between the June,16 or was 
it if the 17th, the 17th, the 
;day of the break-in, except . 
for a meeting on Sept. 15, 
even you have not testified 
to any discussions with the 
President about Watergate. 
Isn't that correct? A. That is, 
correct. 
Q. Now, then we come to 
the year 1973 and from what 
I have been able to gather 
in the questioning I have just 
finished your testimony is 
that on Feb. 28 you did dis-
cuss this matter of obstruc-
tion of justice and then you 
also testified to what you 
did here on March 13, and 
then, of course, we come to 
the meeting on March 21 
when you told him most of 
what Watergate was all 
about. And the summary that 
I can see from the testimony, . 
the President of the United 
States certainly didn't know 
anything about all this busi-
ness, to this one Senator:, 
until this thing on Feb. 28, 
acording to your testimony, 
and on March 13 but espec-
ially, of course, the meeting 
on March, 21 where you did 
discuss with him at great 
length the Watergate and he 
a later press conference said 
that he learned about it on 
that date.. 
dent Nixon's plan to broaden the domestic in-
telligence network been left in effect for a 
longer period. 
Representative Rodino says the situation re-
garding potential "politicization" of the FBI is 
unhealthy. Senator Symington questions tha 
legality of a "secret charter" of presidential 
directives under which the CIA has long oper-
ated without the knowledge of Congress, which 
created the CIA and the legal basis for 
operations. 
The plain fact of the matter is that Congress 
can hardly expect agencies it establishes to 
follow its legislative definitions closely, if it 
leaves those agencies entirely to presidential 
control hidden by the cloak of secrecy. Such 
agencies then become repositories of unchecked 
arbitrary power, as well as possible political ex-
ploitation. They can become a danger to the 
rights and liberties of the people they are 
meant to serve. And the people should know 
about it. Congress has a duty to subject the 
CIA and FBI to an incisive review.

NEW YORK TIMES 
28 JUNE 1973 
Text of White House Analysis of Dean's 
Testimony efore Senate Watergate Unit 
Spotial to The New York Times 
' WASHINGTON. June 27?
Following is a draft of a - 
White House analysis of the 
testimony of John W. Dean 
3d submitted to the Senate 
Watergate committee. today 
together with a series of 
.questions to he asked of Mr. 
Dean. A revised version of 
the draft analysis was read 
. at the committee's hearing 
today by Senator Daniel K. 
Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii, 
and commented on at various 
points by Mr. Dean. The tran-
script of the hearings, includ-
ing the final version of the 
draft analysis and Mr. Dean's 
comments, was not available 
for publication for this edi-
tion. The questions will be 
asked of Mr. Dean tomorrow. 
It is a matter of record 
that John Dean knew of and 
participated in the planning 
that went into the break-in 
at Watergate, though the ex-
tent of his knowledge of that 
specific operation or of his 
approval of the plan ulti-
mately adopted have not yet 
been established. There is no 
reason to doubt, however. 
that John Dean was the 
principal actor in the Water-
gate cover-up, and that while. 
other motivations may have 
played a part, he had a great 
interest in covering up for 
himself. 
Dean came to the White 
House from Justice from a 
background of working on 
problems of demonstrations 
and intelligence. Among those 
working under him at the 
White House were Tom Hus-
ton and Caulfield. Dean was, 
involved in discussions in 
1971 about the Sandwedge 
Plan Caulfield proposed. Ehr-
lichman was told that the 
original authors of the SI-
million plan were Dean and 
Liddy. Whatever the ' fact 
about this, it is clear that 
Dean attended the meetings 
that led up to adoption of 
the Watergate plan. Dean in-
troduced Mitchell (who had 
sponsored Dean for his White 
House position) to Liddy. 
Dean Liddy, and Magru-
der met to discuss intelligence 
- plans of this kind on Jan. 27, 
1972, and, together. with 
Mitchell, on some later date. 
Dean was not present at the 
final meeting on March 30 
when the $250,000 pan was 
approved. It is not clear ' 
whether he was not there be-
Icause he disapproved oo sim-
ply because he was not in 
:Key Biscayne or because he 
'wanted to trv to keep his 
siwn record clean. He is re-
:ported as having said that he 
,"didn't think it was appro-
priate for him to be in on 
;these conversations." He is 
Approved 
;also reported to have said, at 
'a meeting in Mitchell's office, 
that "we shouldn't discuss 
'this in front of Mitchell or in 
:The Attorney General's of-
'flee." 
' At some point during the 
spring Magruder phoned Dean 
rand asked him to talk to 
.Liddy to try and calm him 
ldown. Also on March 26, 
'1973, Dean told Haldeman 
that in the spring of 1972 he 
'had told Haldeman that he. 
had been to two meetings at 
which unacceptable and out-
landish ideas and intelligence : 
gathering had been rejected 
by himself and by Mitchell 
and that he, Dean, proposed 
not to attend any more such 
meetings. (Haldeman may be 
off on this date?compare 
Haldeman deposition). Halde-
man has no personal recol-
lection of Dean telling him 
about the meetings at the 
time but is "willing to accept 
that as a possibility." 
Whatever the facts may 
be on the matters .that are 
Uncertain in the spring of 
1972 about Dean's knowledge 
or approval of the break-in, 
It must have been clear to 
Dean, as a lawyer, when he 
heard on June 17th of Water-
gate, that he was in personal. 
difficulty. The Watergate af-
fair was so clearly the out-
growth of the discussions 
and plans he had been in on 
that he might be well be re-
garded as a conspirator with 
regard to them. He must im-
mediately have had reason 
to realize that his patron, 
Mitchell, would also be in-
volved. 
There is some indication 
that Ehrlichman called Dean 
on June 17th to advise him, 
of the problem and to direct 
him to take charge of it for 
the White House. Even with-
out an instruction, this would 
have been his responsibility, 
as counsel for the President, 
from the time of the occur-
rence and he was active in 
that role from the moment 
of his return to the city a day-
, or two after the break-in. 
On June 19th, Dean met 
with Liddy and learned, 
among other things, of the 
Ellsberg break-in. (that Dean 
met with Liddy and others 
Is confirmed in Magruder 
testimony) There was also a 
meeting that day by Dean 
with Mitchell, Strachan, Mar-
dian, and Magruder to discuss 
a cover-up. A series of meet-
ings, also including LaRue, 
followed throughout the 
summer. 
Dean was not merely one 
'of the architects of the cover-
up plan. He was also perhaps 
its most active participant. 
It was Dean who suggested 
to Haldeman that the F.B.I. 
was concerned that it might 
run into a C.I.A. operation, 
ing on behalf of Mitchell, who 
It was Dean, purportedly act-
came to -Ehrlichman several 
weeks after the break-in to 
obtain approval for fund=rais-
ing by Kalmbach for the ar-
rested persons. It was Dean 
who reviewed the papers 
founed in Hunt's safe and de-
clared that they were "politi-
cally sensitive" and should 
, be given special treatment. 
It was Dean and Mitchell 
who prepared Magruder for 
his perjurous grand jury 
testimony. On Aug. 29th 
when Colson prepared a 
memorandum stating the 
facts as he knew them, and 
suggested it be sent to 
Silbert, it was Dean who 
Said: "For God's sake,destroy 
the memo, it impeaches 
Magruder." It was Dean who 
was the agent in some of the 
money dealings with the 
arrested persons. It was Dean 
who gave Caulfield instruc-
tions on how he was to 
, handle McCord. 
'Perfectly Situated' 
? Throughout all of this 
Dean was perfectly situated 
to master-mind and to carry 
out a cover-up since, as 
counsel to the President and 
the man in charge for the 
White ? House, he had full 
access to what was happen-
ing in the investigation by 
the F.B.I. He sat in on F.B.I. 
intreviews with White House 
witnesses and received in-
vestigative reports. Dean and 
Ehrlichman met with Attor-
ney General Kleindienst late 
in July. The Attorney Gen-
eral described the investiga-
tion and said that "it did 
not appear that any White 
House people or any high-
ranking committee people 
were involved in the prep-
aration or execution of, the. 
break-in." 
History fails to record that 
at that moment Dean cor-
rected the Attorney General's 
erroneous impression by 
pointing out that, however 
innocently Mitchell, Magru-
der. and Dean had all been 
involved in planning of oper-
ations of which Watergate 
was an obvious derivative, 
or that Strachan had knowl-
edge of the fruits of this 
kind of operation, or that all 
of them were suborning per-
jury and otherwise seeking 
to conceal the facts. 
Dean's activity in the 
cover-up also made him, 
perhaps unwittingly, the prin-
cipal author of the political 
and constitutional crisis that 
Watergate now epitomizes. It 
would have been embarrass-
ing to the President if the 
true facts had become known 
shortly after June 17th, but 
it is the kind of embarrass-
ment that an immensely 
popular President could have 
easily have weathered. ? 
The political problem has 
been magnified 1000-fold be-
cause the truth is coming to 
light so belatedly; because of 
insinuations that the White 
House was a party to the 
? cover-up, and, above all, be-
cause the White House was 
led to say things about 
Watergate that have since 
been found to have been un-, 
' true. These added conse- ? 
quences were John Dean's 
doing. ? 
Dean was responsible with-
in the White House for be-, 
coming apprised of what had 
happened, From June 17th on 
Dean had periodic converse-
tions with Ehrlichman "about t 
virtually every aspect of this 
case." Dean reported also to 
Haldeman and to Ziegler, to ' 
him he gave repeated assu-
ranced that he made an "in-
tensive investigation" and 
had found no White House 
involvement: Dean was "the ? 
foundation of the proposition , 
that the White House was. 
not involved." 
With the election nassed 
and public interest in Water-
nate on the Wane. Dean may 
have thought that this coy-, 
er-up had ? been a success, 
although he purported to 
continue an ongoing investi-
gation. In February, however, 
with the Ervin committee be-
ginning its work. the Presl-? 
dent was concerned that all.; 
of the available facts be 
trade known. 
In the middle of February, 
1973, Dean and Richard 
Moore met with Ehrlichman 
and Haldeman at San Cle-
mente. Dean was assigned 
to reduce "to written form 
all of the detailed facts as 
they related both to the com-
mittee to re-elect and the" 
White House." Dean was ? 
pressed continually for that 
statement, particularly by 
Haldeman, but never pro- ? 
duced it. 
QUESTIONS 
1. You quote the President 
as saying on Feb. 27th that 
Haldeman and Ehrlichman 
were "principals" in the' 
Watergate matter and that 
therefore you could be more 
objective. What did you 
understand by this? Did you 
have any evidence then or 
now that Ehrlichman had 
prior knowledge of the break-
in? 
2. If the President was re-
ferring to post June 17th 
events, were you not equally 
a "principal' as you china

3. Your 245 page statement,, 
Is remarkable for the detail ', ? 
with which it recounts events 
and conversations occurring 
over a period of many . 
months. It is particularly re-
markable in view of the fact 
. that you indicated that it 
was prepared without benefit. 
of notes or a daily diary. 
Would you describe what , 
? documents were available to 
you in addition to those. 
. which have been identified as ?

e,struction was based? 
5. Have you always had a 
'facility for recalling the dc-' 
"tails of conversations which 
l; took place many months ago? 
i. 6. Specifically with regard 
to 'the meeting of Sept. 15, '

,  r?
state for the record your rec-
ollection of that meeting,' 
Compare with the version , 
in the prepared statement tot? 
see if it appears either ?In-r, 
consistent or memorized. .+ 
9. You indicated in your' 
testimony yesterday that yote,..: 
were certain after the Sept. A 
' 15th meeting that the Presi-
dent was fully aware of the 
cover-up, did .you not? 
'Won Your Spurs' 
10. And you further testi- . 
? tied that you believed that 
you "had won your spurs" 
*) in handling the cover-up by 
' Feb. 27th when you were . 
,? told by the President that you , 
would report to him directly, , 
. isn't that correct? 
? 11. If that was the case, 
' why did you feel it necessary. 
on Feb. 27th to tell the Presp',-
dent that you had been par-
? ticipating In a cover-up and 
therefore might be' charge-
f..? able with obstruction of jus-, 
tice? ?'. 
12. If, as you assume, the'r 
? President was ware of the , 
cover-up and you had "won 
. your spurs," wouldn't that 
.? have been perfectly obvious? 
13. Did you and your coun-
sel develop a strategy for ob-
t ? 
,)taining immunity from pro-
secution? What , were the 
elements of that strategy? - 
14. Didn't your strategy 
, include deliberate leaks of 
. information to the media on 
:'what you had told investiga-
tors and what you might be

these contacts with the media 
handled? Who represented.,

stories or quotes attributed 
- to you or sources close' to: 
7.; 
you inaccurate? If so, whati, 
if any steps did you take to,.; 
correct these stories? ? ; 
15. Mr. Dean, one point of' 
distinction you drew in your 
testimony puzzles me. You 
? have testified that you had' 
received and placed in your 
safe the sum Apprieed 
which you never turned over 
'to anyone because you didn't 
want funds you had physical-
ly handled to be used for 
payments to the Watergate, 
defendants. You also testi-
fied that you called Mr. Stand, 
and asked him for $22,000 to 
make the $350,000 fund' 
whole, and that you had your' , 
deputy, Mr. Fielding, go to 
Mr. Stans's office, pick up? 
the money and later ,deliver 
It directly 'to Mr. Strachan? 
knowing ,that .$22;000 would, 
probably be ?used for 'pay-
mens to the Watergate de-
fendants. Now do you mean 
to imply that you think there ? 
Is some moral basis for this 
distinction, or were you just 
? being cautious to protect 
yourself technically from 
-; committing the criminal of-
tense of obstructing justice 
!"(at the expense of implicating 
your deputy)? 
: Role of Fielding 
' ? 16. Mr. Dean, you have 
testified as to your close 
working relationship to your 
,deputy, Mr. Fielding. It was 
he who' you sent to pick up 
the $22,000 from Mr. Stens, . 
he who helped you sort the 
documents from Mr. Hunt's 
safe and he who went to 
' England to retrieve Mr: 
Young's secretary. Did Mr. 
Fielding know that you 'were 
Involved in a conspiracy' to 
, obstruct justice, perjure 
' testimony and pay defend-: 
ants for their silence?.' 
' 17. (If answer "no").: If. 
Your deputy, Mr. Fielding,. 
' who worked so closely with 
'you, and who carried out 
, some of your missions con?
nected with the conspiracy, 
had absolutely no, knowledge 
"of the cover-up conspiracy, 
how do you so blithly assume, 
12" that others on the White. 
?? House staff and even the. 
, President did know of your: 
t.:conspiracy? ? 
' 18. Mr. Dean, beginning in 
late . May and, early. June; 
there were a series of news-
'..Paper stories reporting with 
'!--what you had told various" 
Hnvestigators as quotek 
sources close to you as to! / 
what you had said. A number, 
f..1 of these reports, for example 
the one story in The Wash-
...itigton Post of June 3, 
al-
leged that.. you began your 
private meetings with the'? 
President either early in, the't 
year, or as in the case of this'!' 
particular story beginning on 
January 1st. According to 
your testimony today, your ' 
first private meeting with 
the President in 1973 was not 
until Feb. 27. Did you or did 
you not tell investigators 
\ and/or friends that you be-
gan meeting with the Presi-
dent personally either the 
first of the year or begin-.
!;ning Jan. 1, and were these 
, stories an attempt to exag-
gerate The length 'of, time 
which you had been daling 
directly with the President 
and by implication imparting 
tri him knowledge of ? the 
Watergate? ? 
? . 
Leaks and Immunity 
19. Mr. Dean. the number 
of source stories containing 
allegations against the Presi-
_dent_ attributed directly or 
For Kelease 2001/08/07 
indirec? tly to 'you' over the 
last four or five weeks have 
been most numerous. Do you 
, deny that these stories were 
planted in a calculated at-
tempt to influence Federal 
o. prosecutors to believe .you 
had such important testimony 
that they should 'give you 
transactional immunity, from 
.. the crimes which you have 
o committed in return for your 
testimony against others? 
20. Mr. Dean, the May 14, 
1973 edition of Newsweelc 
,,.carried a long article abotit 
you and your prospective tes-
t.- this article you 
her of 
were q 
,1 times and in' many Instances 
the quotes in that article 
were word-by-word identical 
to the testimony you have 
given this week. Indeed, for 
the most part this Newsweek 
article was a very 'accurate 
.preview summary of the., 
lengthy 'statement which you. 
detailed before this commit-. 
'tee. There are, however, sev-
eral very noticeable differ-. 
.ences. One difference is an 
omission from the testiniony 
you gave here. ' , 
You told this committee'. 
that when the President dis-, . 
cussed the matter of your in-
vestigation of Watergate. you, 
did not tell him you made no", 
such investigation. The News-
week article, however, re-
ports that in your meeting 
with the President of March 
,21, and I quote, "Dean also 
bore down hard. he said, on 
the fact that .there had never' 
been any .study clearing' 
'white House staffers. 
, "Mr. Nixon replied that lie" 
'had had verbal reports of 
, Dean's Work. but the counsel 
'insisted, 'nobody asked me-
- for a report. Mr. President.' 
he said. 'I did not go around' 
asking people questions in ? 
their offices. There was. no 
report.' At this point, sources 
quoted Dean, as 'saying that 
'the President came out. of 
his chair' into a half crouch 
of astonishment and shock." 
? If the Newsweek account 
is Correct, Mr. Dean, the 
President's reaction was 
most inconsistent with that ? 
to whic hyou have testified 
before this committee. Did 
you or did you not tell the 
President that you had never 
conducted an investigation, 
and have you made the 
statement previously that 
"the President came out of 
his chair into a half crouch 
of astonishment and shock"? 
Operation Sandwedge 
21. Mr. Dean, did I under-' 
stand you to testify earlier 
that you had led Mr. Caul-. 
field to believe you were as-
.sisting him in obtaining ap-' 
proval and funding for what 
he called Operation 'Sand-
wedge, but that in fact you 
let Operation Sandwedge die 
a natural death? 
22. If answer is affirma-
tive: I call your attention to 
Exhibit 'No. 11 which is a 
memorandum for the Attor-
ney General from John Dean, 
dated Jan. 12, 1972, and I 
call your attention to the 
first sentence of the second 
paragraph which says, "Open; 
ation Sandwedge will be in 
need for refunding at the 
: CIA-RDP77-00432R0001 
1.S 
end of this month, so the 
time is quite appropriate for 
such a review." Mr. Dean, if 
you let Operation Sandwedge, 
die a natural death, why did 
you state to Mr. Mitchell that 
it would be in need of re- ' 
funding at the ned of Jan-, 
uary? 
23. Mr. Dean, if I recall 
correctly you testified to this 
committee that it .was not 
your idea for Magruder's 
diary to be altered nor were 
you aware before Mr. Ma-
gruder testifed before the 
grand jury last September 
that Mr. Magruder would tes-
tify that the first meeting 
appearing' i nhis diary had 
been canceled, and the sec-
ond meeting had been to dis-
cuss election laws. On both' 
' of these points your testi-
mony is in direct conflict 
with the sworn testimony of 
Mr. Magruder. Are we to be-
lieve that Mr. Magruder lied 
as to these details concern; 
ing you, and if that is your 
position, what could Mr. 
Magruder's motive be for 
lying about the details of the, 
manner in which Mr. Ma-
gruder's perjury was con-
ceived? 
24. Mr. Dean, Ma-
? gruder also testified that Mr., 
Liddy told him that you, 
among others, had indicated 
:he would have a million dol-
lars for his plans which he 
had been working on before 
1,,he even came to the comil-
' tee. You testified, on the 
other hand, that you were 
:surprised when Mr. Liddy 
briefed his million dollar in-
telligence plan to Mr. Mit-
'chell in your presence. To 
what motive do,you attribute 
?Mr. Liddy' S 'report to' Mr. 
'Magruder that you knew 
'About his' extensive plan be-
fore you saw them in Mr., 
:Mitcsell's office? . 
Meeting With Krogh 
25. Mr. Dean, just prior to 
taking Mr. Liddy to meet Mr. 
Magruder in early Decem-
ber,. 1972, did you and Mr. 
Liddy not have a meeting 
with Mr. Egil Krogh and did 
you not at that time tell Mr. 
Liddy he would have one mil-, 
lion dollars for intelligence 
?gathering 'at' the committee?, 
. 26. Mr. Dean, Mr. Magruder, 
, testified that in March 1972? 
Mr. Liddy had threatened to 
kill Mr. Magruder and that 
Mr. Magruder made a deci-
sion to terminate Mr. Liddy's 
'employment. In this connec-
tion, Mr. Magruder testified 
that he received a call from 
you encouraging him not to 
become personally concerned. 
about Mr. Liddy and not to 
let personal animosity get in 
the way of Mr. Liddy's proj-
ect. Did you in March inter-. 
cede with Mr. Magruder on. 
Mr. Liddy's behalf and if so, 
since you have said you as-
sumed Mr. Liddy's intelligence 
project died after your meet-
ing in February, what , was 
the project of Mr. Liddy that 
you urged Mr. Magruder to 
give priority over his per-
sonal animosities? 
27. Mr. Dean, Mr. Magruler 
testified under oath that 
prior to his August 16 grand 
Jury appearance at a meeting 
00180001-7 
Approved For Release 2001/08/07 : CIA-RDP77-00432R000100180001-7 
In your office, you told' him ? 
.that if the worst happened, 
"everything would he taken 
care of, even executive clem-
ency:" Did you make such a 
promise of executive clem-
ency to Mr. Magruder as he 
. testified and if so, did you 
have authority from anyone 
, else to make such an offer,, 
';or was it on your own in-
itiative? ?? ? ? 
28. Mr. Dean, you have de-
picted all others in the White 
House as excessively preoccu-
,pied with political intelli-
glnce, use of court methods 
and security, and yourself as 
a restraining influence. on 
:these preoccupations. Yet, 
Your background, of responsi-
bilities at the Justice Departv 
ment seems to suggest that 
your experience in these very, 
types of activities might have 
contributed to your being in-, 
;,vited to join the White House 
,staff. What precisely were 
?your duties in connection, 
with demonstrations while 
you were at the Justice De-
partment? 
29. Immediately after you 
were appointed counsel . to 
the President, did you not 
take over the responsibilities 
of Mr. Tom Huston in con-
nection with intelligence ac-
tivities? 
30. You did testify, did you 
not, that political intelligence 
was routed to you in the 
White House?  
Memorandum Cited 
31. Mr. Dean, I believe that' 
you were the author of the 
memorandum to the Attorney 
General which led to the 
establishment of the intelli-
gence evaluation committee.' 
,Did you hold the first meet-
ing of that committee in your 
office? 
32. Were you not the one 
on the White House staff 
who levied requirements on. 
and received the reports from, 
the intelligence evaluation 
committee? ? , ? 
. 33. In interagency meet-
ings to plan for handling 
, demonstrations, were you not., 
the White House representa-
tive? 
34. in .The St. Louis Post-
Dispatch. of May 14, 1973,1 
there is a report that you at-
tempted to recruit a Depart-. 
ment of Interior employe, Mr. 
Kenneth Tapman, for under-
cover work at the Democratic 
convention. Did you attempt 
to recruit Mr. Tapman, or 
any others for undercover 
work, and what prior experi-
ence did you have in recruit-
Ing for undercover work? 
35. Mr. Dean, you have 
testified concerning your on : 
versations on three different 
occasions with Gen. Vernon 
Walters, the deputy . director 
of C.I.A., beginning on the 
26th of June. General, Wal-
ters prepared a memorandum' 
for the record of each of 
these conversations with you. 
In General Walter's memo-
randum for the record for', 
your meeting with him on 26 
June, you are, reported to 
have asked General Walters' 
Whether there was not some 
way that the Central Intelli-
gence Agency could pay bail 
for the Watergate defend-
ants, and if the men went to 
prison could C.I.A. find some, 
Iway to pay their salaries, 
? while they were in jail out, 
of covert actions funds. In 
your testimony you made no' 
mention of asking General 
Walters whether the C.I.A. 
. could pay the Watergate de-
fendants' bail or salaries 
while they were in prison.' 
Was this' an intended omis-' 
, sin on your part in the. in" 
'Wrests of saving them, or do 
you deny .that you made 
these specitic requests ofl 
? General Walters? 
36. Mr. Dean, I believe you 
testified that on March 26th, 
:while you were at Camp' 
David, you called Mr. Mar-
gulls, the attorney, for Mr. 
Liddy, and asked for a state-
,ment by Mr. Liddy that you, 
had no prior knowledge of 
the Watergate break-in. Is 
that correct? 
? 37. Now you also testified, 
did you not, that it was on 
March 28th that Mr. Halde-
man called you to meet with 
Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Ma-
-gruder and that it was at 
that time you became con.' 
victed 'you had to look out 
for yourself, isn't that cor-
rect? 
38. If you were, as you, 
testified, still a part of the 
cover-up team on March 26th, 
why were yo utrying to get 
material to absolve yourself 
at that point? 
39. If on March 26th, after 
,you, according to your testi-
mony, had admitted to mak-
ing payments to Watergate 
defendants to obstruct jus-
tice, offering clemency to the' 
defendants to bostruct justice', 
and suborning perjury, you, 
were still actively trying to 
build your defense against 
,having prior knowledge of the 
break-in. on March 26th,, 
doesn't this demonstrate that 
throughout this affairs your 
'motivation was to protect 
yourself against the criminal 
charge of authorizing and 
directing the Watergate 
break-in?. , ; 
40. You Stated that Me' 
Maroulis called -you back ort 
the "29th: of March' and told 
you he could not get you the 
statement you wanted from 
? Mr. Liddy. Did you, record, 
'either of these telephoiie 
versations you had with Mr,) 
,Maroulis? .? 
16 
41. A central credibilit3.01; 
question is: What prompted 
Dean's tactics in March and/ 
April 1973?the desire WI 
have the truth told or: the 
;effort to achieve immunity, 
from prosecution. The follow.i 
ing sequence of events 
important: 
?Dean's admitted personal, 
connection with the, offer of. 
clemency to McCord in Jatf-'. 
uary (Dean to Caulfield toc 
McCord via Ulasewicz) (p.4 
141). 
?Dean's admitted personal, 
connection with Hunt's de-, 
mand for more money on; 
March 19 (Hunt .to O'Brien, 
to Dean). 
. 
?Dean's meeting with the'! 
President on March 21-22. On 
any version of this meeting 
is was an effort to get the, 
President to take action on; 
what was becoming a per.; 
sonal problem for Dean. 
---,McCord's letter to Judge 
Sirica on March,23. This was, 
the critical break in the, 
cover-up. Dean learned via a, 
call from O'Brien. On March 
25 press comments directly 
linked Dean with knowledge 
of the Watergate break-in., 
He called Liddy's attorney, 
Maroulin, on March 27th to, 
get a statement that he did. 
not have prior knowledge of: 
break-in. Maroulis called 
back on March 29th with 
word that he couldn't give, 
him a statement. This state-,. 
ment might have been taped.' 
On March ,28th and March 
29th he solicited names oc 
criminal counsel, On. March, 
30th, he decided to retaid.: 
Mr. Shaffer. ' 
Time had run out; the cov-,, 
er-up had come apart; 'Dean 
was centrally involved. He 
sent his lawyers to the U. S.4 
attroney on Monday, April 
and commenced his negotia-t 
Lions for immunity." '

,From: Tom Charles Huston 
Subject: Domestic Intelligence 
In, anticipation of your meeting with 
Mr. .Hoover and the Attorney General 
I would like to pass on these thoughts 
I. More than the FBI is involved in 
this operation. NSA, DIA, CIA, and the 
ilitary services all have a great' stake 
a a great interest. All of these agen 
c 6-supported the options selected by 
the President. For your private infor 
mation, so did all the members of Mr 
Hoover's staff who worked orti the report 
t(he'd fire, them if he knew this.) 
which will simply go away as soon as 
the.Scranton Commission files its re-
port, The one statement that Rennie 
Dayis made at HEW which I thought 
made sense was that the Attorney Gen-
eral:was kidding himself when he said 
? the;eampuses would be quiet this fall., 
D4Vis predicted that at least 30 wouldi 
14 closed down in September. I don't 
Ake to make predictions, but I am not 
?af all convinced, on the basis of the in-
. teThgence I have seen, that we are any-
way near over the hump On this prob-
letfi,'and I am convinced that the p0-
',for even greater violence is 
praent and we have a positive oblige-
tioli( to. take every .step within our? 
power to prevent it. 
6. hoover can be expected to raise 
the hallowing points In yourmeeting:, 
) "Our ' present efforts are -ode-
qtiiite." The answer is bullshit! This is 
particularly true' with regard to FBI 
campus coverage. 
-.lb). "The eiiks are too great; these, 
folks' are going to get the President 
into trouble and RN had better listen 
to .me." The answer is that we have 
considered the risks, we believe they 
are acceptable and justified under the 
circumstances. We are witting to weigh 
each exceptionally sensitive operation 
on its merits, but the Director of the 
FBI is paid to take risks where the se-
curity'of the country is at stake. Noth-
ing we propose to do has not,been, 
done in the past ? and in the past it 
was always done successfully. ? 
(c) "I don't have the personnel to do 
'the job the President wants done." The 
answer Is (1) he has the people and/or 
(2) he can get them. 
(d) "I don't object to NSA condnet-
ing surreptitious entry if they want , 
to.", The answer is that NSA doesn't 
have the people, can't get them, has no 
authority to get them, and shouldn't, 
have to get them. It is an FBI job. ? 
(Paragraph has been deleted by the 
Senate committee for national security 
!awns.) 
?i3:$ We Are not getting the type of 
hard intelligence we need at the White 
Heuse. We will not get ,it until greater 
effort 'is made through community-
wide coordination' to dig out the in-
forMation by -using all the resources 
potentially available. It is, of course, a 
mater of balancing the obvious risks' 
? 
against 'the desired results. I thought 
We 'balanced thee risks rather objec-
tifely lir the report, and Hoover is es-
ealating the risks in order to cloak his 
determination to continue to do busi-
ness as usual; . 
-4:4At? some point, Hoover has to he , 
told; who is President. Me has become ' 
totally unreasonable and his conduct is 
detrimental to our domestic intent- I 
gence operations, In the ? past two 
weeks, he has terminated all FBI liai-
sorrwith NSA, DIA, the military serv-
ices, Secret Service ? everyone except 
the' White House, , lie terminated liai-
son with?CIA in May. This is bound to 
have a crippling effect upon the entir 
community and Is contrary to his pub--
liwassurance to the President at the 
meeting that there was close and effec-
tive. coordination and cooperation 
within the intelligence community. It 
Is Important to remember that the en-
tire intelligence, community knows 
that the Presidentmade a positive de-
cision to go ahead and Hoover has now 
succeeded in forcing a review. If he 
gets his way it is going to look like he 
Is' more .powerful than the President, 
He?had his say in the footnotes and 
RN:decided against him. That should 
close the ,matter and I can't under-
stand why the AG is a party to reopen-
Infra. All of us are going to look damn 
sillyln the eyes of Helms, Gayler, Ben-
nett; and the military chiefs if Hoover 
scate,unilaterally reverse a ? Presidential 
decision based on a report that many 
people worked their asses off to pre-
pare and which, on its 'merits, was a 
first-rate, objective job. 
17 
(e) "If we do these things, the ' 
'jackets (sic) of the press' and the , 
,ACLU will find out; we can't avoid 
leaks." Answer: We can avoid leaklv, 
by using trained, trusted agents and. 
restricting knowledge of sensitive op-
erations on a strict need to know basis. 
We do this on other sensitive opera. 
lions every day. 
0) "If I have to do these things, the', 
Attorney General will havuto approve , 
them in writing," This is eit'to the AG', , 
but I would tell hoover that he has 
been instructed to do them by the 
President and he is to do them on that , 
authority, lie needn't look for a scape 
goat. He has his authority from the 
President and he doesn't need a writ-
ten memo from the AG. To maintain ?

graalit sten.

(g), ''We don't need an Inter:Agency - 
.Committee on Intelligence Operntions ? 
because (1) we're doing fine right now 
..,--good coordination, etc.?and .(2) 
'there are other existing groups which 
can handle this assignment." The an-
swer is that we are doing lousy .right 
,now and there aren't other groups . 
,which can do the job we have in mind' 
'because: (1) they don't rheet; (2) they 
don't have the people on them we want 
,or have some people we don't want; (3) 
they don't have the authority to do 
what we want done; (4) ultimately this 
new operation will replace, them; and 
(5), they aren't linked to the whlte 
lionse staff. ' 
There are doubtless another dozen 
or so specious arguments that Hoover 
,will 'raise, but they wilt be of similar 
quality. I hope that you will be able to, 
convince the AG of the importance 
Mut necessity of getting Hoover tp go, 
along. We have worked for nearly a 
;year to reach this point; others have 
worked far longer and had abandoned 
hope. I believe we are talking .about 
the future of this country, for surely 
domestic violence and )disorder 
threaten the very fabric of our society. 
'Intelligence is not the cure, but it,can 
.provide the diagnosis that makes a 
.cure possible. More importantly,- it can 
provide us with the meam to prevent 
the deterioration of the situation. Per-
haps lowered voices and peace in Viet-
nam will defuse the tense situation ,we 
Lace, but I wouldn't want to reIY? on it 
exclusively. 
There is this final point. For eigh-
teen months we have watched people in 
this government ignore the President's 
orders, take actions to embarrass him, 
promote themselves at his expense, 
and generally make his job more diffi-
cult. It makes me fighting- mad, and 
what Hoover is doing here is putting 
'himself above the President. If , he 
thought the Attorney General's advice. 
should be solicited, he should have , 
done so before the report was sent to 
the President. After all, Hoover was 
chairman of the committee and he t 
could have asked the AG for his corn- . 
.ments. 13ut no, he didn't do so for it 
never occurred to him that the Presi-
dent would not, agree' with his foot-
noted objections. He thought all he' 
had to do was put in a footnote and 
the matter was settled. He had abso-
lutely no interest in the views of NSA, 
CIA, DTA, and the military services, 
and obviously he has little interest in 
our views, or 'apparently even in the 
decisions of the President. I don't see 
- how we can tolerate this, but being a 
, fatalist, if not a realist, I am pripared 
to accept the fact that we may.have to 
4 
do so.

STATUS REPORT ON, ? 
SPECIAL SERVICE GROUP 
In August 1969 the Senate Commit-
tee on Government 'Operations held 
'open hearings on several controversial 
organizations including the Black Pan-
ther Party, Student. National Coordi-
nating ',CoMthittee; Republic of New 
. Africa, and, Students for Democratic 
Society. Information developed during 
? these hearings established that various 
organilations; categorized as extrem-
ists on the right, or left, presented 
problems to the Internal Revenue in 
the organizations were not in eompli-
'ance with Internal Revenue laws. In-
formation developed in these bearings 
indicated that extremist organizations 
were receiving financial support from 
various sources. Some of the individu-
als 'involved in the forefront of these 
organizations filed tax returns reflect-
ing very nominal income, or did not 
file at all, although they were obvi-' 
ously expending substantial amounts 
of funds. 
? ? Recognizing the responsibilities.'of 
the Internal Revenue Service to ad.'

gard to the social or political objec-
fives of individuals or organizations, a

that might result from their activities 
and the likelihood that ,this notoriety

The staff responsible for this Reify." 
ity was first designated as the Activist' 
Organizations Group, but it recently', 
was changed to "Special Service 
Group"to avoid any erroneous impres-
sion of its objectives. The function of 
the Special Service Group is to obtain,, 
consolidate and disseminate any in-
formation on individuals or organiza-
tions (including' major financial spon-
sors of the ? individuals or 
organizations) that would have tax im-
plications under the Internal Revenue' 
laws. Liaison has been established with 
, all investigative and law enforcement 
agencies and with Senate anti House, 
Investigating Committees. The Group 
also subscribes' to various underground 
publications as a source of Information 
on matters involving taxable Income of 
individuals, activities of organizations 
having or seeking tax exempt status, 
and identity of individuals' or exempt . 
organizations providing financial sup.' 
.port to activist groups. In the case of 
"financial support" our interest is to , 
he able to determine that donors do 
not receive tax benefit from the firm- ? 
cial assistance where such benefit is 
not clearly allowable by law. 
As information is accumulated ? on 
the activities or financial support of 
particular organizations or taxable in-
come of individuals it is referred to 
? 
the appropriate field ?offiee of the In-
ternal Revenue Service for enforce 
ment attion.' Field Offices may be 
asked to investigate the activities of ? 
organizations which have been held to 
be exempt as charitable organizations; 
they may be asked to investigate the 
income tax liability of individuals who 
have openly expCnded substantial 
sums of money without obvious means 
of support or they may be asked to in-
vestigate alleged violations of.the fire-, 
arms statutes falling within the juris-
diction of the Alcohol, Tobacco and

It is Important to note that' alt hough 
various types of information about or-

by the Service from cooperating agen-
cies, only that information relating to

17 atter gate Case 
Iei il#ers Soviets 
By Robert G. Kaiser 
WsshInston Post Staff Writer 
At a reception?in Moscow 
recently, a Soviet journalist 
who once lived In Washing-
ton was explaining the 
Watergate affair to an 
American colleague. One 
thing, the Russian said, was' 
certain?President Nixon 
would survive Watergate. 
The American tried to ex-
plain that the Situation was 
complicated?that , Mr. 
' Nixon was in serious diffi-
culty. "Well," the Russian 
, conceded, "I'll always re-
member what Jim Garrison 
said. Ile said that they got 
Kennedy, and if another 
*American president ever 
tries to turn the .United 
States away from militar-
ism, they'll get him too." 
What do Leonid I. Brezh-
nev and his Soviet col-
leagues really think about 
Watergate? The question is 
unanswerable, but the anec-
dote about the New ?Heins 
district attorney who failed 
to prove a conspiracy to kill 
Kennedy gives a hint of the 
confusion Watergate has 
created in Soviet minds. 
For a Soviet Communist, 
Watergate is a bewilder-
ment. Its every element con-
tradicts hianxist-Leninist ide-
ology. The gravity of the 
affair defies Soviet notions 
of common sense. 
Perhaps most important. 
the Soviets -seem to inter-
pret a threat to President 
Nixon as a threat to them-
selves, largely because 'they 
have invested so much in 
their new relationship with 
Mr. Nixon. 
Officially, the Soviets 
have made no substantive 
'comment on Watergate. Or-
dinary Soviet citizens?. 
apart from those who listen 
to foreign radio broadcasts 
?know virtually nothing 
about it. Brezhnev has In-
sisted publicly that he will 
neither exploit nor even 
mention Watergate in his 
talks this week with Presi-
dent Nixon. 
Unofficially. Soviet jour-
nalists in East Europe and 
elsewhere have suggested 
that the furor over Water-
gate is the work of a right-
wing conspiracy designed to 
frustrate Mr. Nixon's de-
lente policy. One journalist 
In Moscow recently slam-
tied his desk in mock anger 
and said with a stern expres-
sion and a wink, "You can't 
do this to our Nixon!" 
But. what the Soviets re-
ally think is a mystery. 
Much depends on the- repor-
torial skill of Ambassador 
Anatoliy F. Dobrynin. who 
Is known in Washington at a 
brilliant diplomat, though 
no one In Washington reads 
the messages he dispatches' 
to Moscow. 
Dobrynin was away from 
his post and in Moscow 
when -the crucial decision 
was made to announce firm 
int6.11igence agencies involved forl, 
personnel that might be appropriately 
;.involved in this activity or Nvito mLght

(2) You request that HooVer assign

.(3) I request that other involved in-'

for the interagency unit. 
. (4) I request from the agencies names. 
? of,, appropriate personnel for assign:' 
ment to the operation. I ? 
r 
? 'Finally, I would suggest that. you"

:,problems'as they emerge and to make1 
certain that we are moving this pro= 
gram Into. implementation as, quickly 
.as possible,

dates for this summit meet-
ing. He didn't have an op-
portunity to report from 
here on the signficance of 
then-recent events: the dis-
missal of?the Ellsberg prose; 
cotton, L. Patrick Gray's as-
sertion that he had warned 
President Nixon about. a 
Watergate cover-up, the in-
dictments of John N. Mitchell 
and Maurice H. Stalls, and the 
shakeup of Mr. Nixon's Cabi-
net. 
Despite that coincidenoc 
of ominous events during 
the second week of May, the 
Soviets agreed on May 12 to 
announce firm dates for the 
Brezhnev visit. Some cynics 
suggested at the time that 
the Soviet leader knew ex-
actly what he was doing, 
and would .demand appropo, 
Hate gestures of apprecia-
tion from Mr. Nixon in re-
turn for his willingness to 
weather the Watergate tem-
pest. 
This argument may tempt 
the cynics, but it is too sim-
ple.- It seems much more 
likely that the Soviets sim-
ply don't take the Watergate 
affair as seriously as many 
Americans. After all, the 
kind of behavior for which 
Mr. Nixon's associates are 
now under investigation is 
perfectly normal for the So-
viet political police. 
The Russians, who are al-
'ways inclined to believe that 
other societies are much 
like their own, probably 
can't imagine that Water-
gate-style activities aren't 
typical here as well. . 
- 
The Soviets are great 'ad-
mirers of authority. They 
must find It hard to believe 
that the President of the 
United States, after an un-
precedented electoral vic-
tory, is believed by some to 
be in danger of losing his 
authority now. 
Brezhnev himself sug-
gested this attitude when he 
was asked about Watergate 
on his visit to West Ger-
many last month. "What do 
you expect." he asked, "an 
earthquake?" He obviously 
did not. 
The history orthe Water-
gate affair also suggests 
that the American system of 
checks and balances' has 
some vitality, a proposition 
that is ideologically inadmis-
sible in the Soviet Union. 
Ideology plays a more in-
portant role in determining 
the Soviet view of the world 
than many Westerners ap-
preciate. 
Events may prove that So-
viet skepticism about the 
importance of Watergate 
was justified. But if the 
scandal grew worse and the 
President's position were 
threatened, the Russians 
would be likely to regard 
that the turn of events as a 
threat to them. The Soviets 
? like Americans ? assume 
that they must he an impor-
tant factor in important 
events. As they have already 
revealed, Soviets watching 
the -Watergate affair unfold 
tend to see a plot against 
themselves just below the 
surface.

Hunt Alleged 
Blackmait 
White Housel 
By Bob Woodward 
and Carl Bernstein 
WaAhington Pot Staff Writers ? '4 ; 
Watergate conspirator E. 
Howard Hunt Jr. effectively . 
. blackmailed the White. 
House by threatening to dis-
close the involvement a 
?? high Nixon administration' 
officials.in secret Illegal ac-
tivities unless he received ? 
large sums of money and a 
? guarantee of executive clem-
ency, according to govern-
ment sources. 
Since the Watergate 
; break-in almost a year ago, . 
. the sources reported, Hunt.: 
' has been paid more than! 
$200,000 to remain silent. 
and received repeated assur-
ances of clemency. Shortly 
before he was to he sen-
tenced in March, Hunt de-
. mancied an additional $1.30,, 
1000 that was never paid, the 
. sources said. 
# Investigators have estab-
lished that White House and 
, Nixon campaign officials, in, 
eluding former presidential' 
special counsel Charles W. 
Colson, received at least 
five "messages" from Hunt' 
demanding money and clem-
ency between June, 1972,.'? 
, and March, 1973, the sources 
t reported. 
Senate and Justice De- . 
partment investigators now 
believe that the acquies- ? 
cencc of high White House 
officials in the Watergate ' 
cover-up was in part related 
to their fears that Hunt . 
would reveal the Nixon ad- , 
ministration's secret opera- , 
tions against radicals, politi-
cal opponents and the press. 
Testimony at the Senate 
,Watergate hearings has es-
stablished that an obstruc-
tion of justice was contem-
plated Immediately after the 
June 17 arrests in the Demol 
crats' Watergate headquar-i 
ters. 
Another factor, however, 
according to one source, was 
that "from, the beginning 
Hunt began blackmailing 
the White ? House." The 
source. added: ? 
"They (White House 
officials) went along . . . In 
fact, it is Hunt's demands 
and threats that make the 
case a clear example of ob-
struction of justice. Hunt 
was being paid to keep 
quiet. It demolishes the ar-
gument that . the money was 
just for lawyers' fees and 
care for the families of the 
defendants?' 
Sources said that with-
out the crucial element of 
paid hit* silence, it would 
be difficult to prove obstrue-
tion of justice on anyone's 
part in connection with pay-
ments to the defendants. 
One source said: "It 
would have been embarrass-
ing for It to get out that the 
White House was paying le-
gal fees, but that's not ille-
gal. The evidence that the 
payment (to Hunt) was for 
silence proves the case of 
obstruction." 
. The prosecutors in the 
Watergate case also have 
testimony from conspirator 
James W. McCord Jr. that 
he was offered money to re-
main silent. 
Hunt, the author of more 
than 40 spy-and-sex novels, 
relayed his initial demand to 
the White House within days 
of the Watergate arrests, in-
vestigative sources said, by 
cryptically warning: "The 
writer has a minuscript of a 
play to sell." 
* M. Douglas Caddy, the 
first attorney retained by 
Hunt and the other Water-
gate conspirators, relayed 
the message to Paul 
O'Brien, an attorney for the 
President's re-election com-
mittee, the sources said. 
in turn, O'Brien, who has 
told investigators he was not 
aware of the identity of the 
"writer" or the precise 
meaning of the message, re-
layed it to John W. Dean 
III, then President Nixon's 
-White House counsel, ac-
cording to the sources. 
At the White House, the 
sources said, the message 
about selling a manuscript 
or a play was clearly recog-
nized as a threat from Hunt 
and shortly thereafter large 
cash disbursements began 
flowing to the conspirators, 
especially Hunt. 
The initial payments to 
H u n t, according to the 
sources, were made by Fred-
erick C. LaRue, an aide at, 
the Nixon campaign com-
mittee, who delivered the 
cash either directly to Hunt 
or to Hunt's present attor-
ney, William 0. Bittman. 
Bittman, the sources said, 
has acknowledged to investi-
gators that he received three 
or four sealed envelopes 
from LaRue for delivery to 
Hunt, but maintains that be 
did not know that the envel-
opes contained money. 
Meanwhile, the sources 
said, Hunt had been assured 
through representatives of 
the Committee for the Re-
election of the President 
that he would receive execu-
tive clemency if he re-
mained silent. 
"Hunt viewed it as similar 
to a CIA operation," one 
source observed. "If a deal 
blows up, everybody's taken 
care of." 
However, by the fall of 
1972, Hunt "said he was 
damn dissatisfied with his 
channels to the White House 
? 
clemency were real," an-
other source reported. 
"So he wrote a three-page 
letter that he gave to Bitt-
man with new demands. 
he upped the ante and de-
manded more direct chan-
nels with the White House 
and assurance of an execu-
tive clemency." The source 
added: "It kicked up a crisis 
at the White House." 
At about this time, the 
sources reported, Hunt con-
tacted then-presidential spe-
cial counsel Colson, who had 
originally hired Hunt as a 
White House donsultant. 
Colson, according to the 
sources, taped the conversa-
tion with Hunt to protect 
his own interests and has 
supplied the recording to in-
vestigators. One source de-
scribed the conversation as 
follows: "Hunt was very up-
set and threatened to talk, 
making it clear in some 
strong, if not wild language 
that he had better get more 
attention." ' 
Later, at least two other 
threats bY Hunt were con-
veyed to high White House 
'officials, one of them by 
Bittman, who visited with 
Colson in the White House 
in December, according to 
investigators. 
As previously reported, 
former White House counsel 
Dean told investigators that 
Bittman approached Colson 
In December to say that 
"something had to be done"' 
to avoid a long jail term for 
Hunt. 
Colson then passed the re-
quest along to Dean and 
John D Ehrlichman, then 
the President's top domestic 
adviser, who answered, "I'll 
check," according to ac-
counts of Dean's allegations. 
Ehrlichman then walked 
into the President's Oval Of-, 
flee and returned with what 
he said was a promise of ex-
ecutive clemency for Hunt, 
according to Dean's version 
of-events. 
Ehrlichman instructed 
Colson to tell Batman that 
"everything is ok" but not to 
be too specific in relaying 
the clemency offer, accord-
ing to this account, which 
has been provided to the 
Washington Post by two 
sources and was initially re-
ported in Newsweek maga-
zine last month. 
Bittman has declined to 
comment on the matter. 
Hunt's final demand to 
the White House came on 
March 16, according to in-
vestigators, one week before 
he and his co-conspirators 
were to be sentenced. 
"His wife was dead and he 
was going to jail. There was 
no one to take care of his 
children." one source said, 
and again Hunt asked for 
more money---$130.000, ac-
cording to several sources.

NEW YORK TIMES 
18 JUNE 1973 
To Check on C.I.A. 
To the Editor: 
On June 7 you printed a letter fro 
Robert F. Drinan, Member of Congress 
4th Dist. Mass., in which he calle 
"incredible" my statement, "... in m 
opinion the Congress has done a g 
job of checking on C.I.A. activities" 
(0p-Ed May 17). 
Father Drinan then goes on to say 
that he was advised that only two 
members of Congress knew how much 
money was voted for C.I.A. in 1971; 
and the even more misleading state-
ment, "... no one in the Congress yet 
knows how much money the C.I.A. 
. spends or how it expends the amount 
allotted." 
From 1953 through 1961; as In-
spector General of C.I.A. I was charged 
by the Director with assisting in the 
supervision of the Agency's work with 
the Congress. From 1962 until I left 
.the Government in 1965 as the Execu-
tive Director-Comptroller, I was in 
charge of the preparation of the budget 
and its presentation to the Appropria-
tions Committees. In fact, the first 
budget hearing I attended was with 
C.I.A. Director Walter Bedell Smith in 
1951 when Clarence 'Cannon of Mis--
souri Was chairman. 
In this period covering some fifteen 
years C.I.A. gave to the committee a 
full report on its budget. In fact,-
under the chairmanship of Representa-
tive' George Mahon of Texas, the 
House Appropriations Committee ex-
amined in even greater detail the 
amounts allotted and 'the rationale 
behind the expenditures. Further, mem-
bers of the subcommittee were invited 
to examine details of the budget to 
whatever extent their time permitted. 
As far as the Armed Services Com-
mittees arc concerned, there never was 
any question but that the C.I.A. sub-
committee members could inform 
themselves of whatever details about 
C.I.A., within whatever guidelines the 
chairman prescribed. Thus my state-
ment about the quality of the Congres-
sional check on C.I.A. ? 
Father Drinan's letter does illustrate 
what I consider to be a situation, not 
-in the best interests of the nation: 
that some members of the Congress 
,are not even aware of the extent of . 
review of C.I.A. performed by the sub-
committees in Appropriations ., and 
Armed Services in both houses.

'would not work (and) that

anyway," according to a 
Senate Watergate commit-
tee memorandum. 
The demand for money 
would be satisfied with 
that?' " 
The Senate Watergate 
' committee memorandum Is 
a summary compiled from 
'information supplied orally 
and In writing by White 
House officials on the Presi-
dent's meetings with Dean 
.from April, 1972, until April, 
1973. Included are 37 meet, 
ings or telephone conversa-
tions that the White House 
? says Mr. Nixon had with 
Dean between Feb. 27 and 
April 22 of this year. 
Dean has reportedly told 
Senate investigators and 
federal prosecutors that he 
discussed aspects of the 
Watergate cover-up with Mr. 
Nixon or in Mr. Nixon's 
presence on at least 35 occa-
sions between January and 
April, 1973. Dean has not 
yet, however, made those 
,allegations under oath. 
The White House version. 
of those meetings disputes 
Dean's by stating that he 
did not tell Mr. Nixon until 
March 21 that a number of 
:White House officials proba-'' 
%ly knew either about they 
:bugging in advance or par-
aicipated in the cover-up. ' 
One of the charges report-
, 
k,..edly made by Dean is that 
he Presid6nt told Dean at a 
Dnecting shortly before the 
t-sentencing of? the seven 
vatergnte defendants 
March 23 that there would 
? e no problem paying $1, 
million to the conspirators 
:.for their continued silence, 
$I'hat money, Dean has sup-
posedly told investigators, 
.17,vas to be in addition to 
$460,000 paid to the conspir-
tof the psychiatrist of Daniel 
11sherg, who leaked the 
!,Pentagon Papers to the 
1)ress, but Ehrlichman did 
not report that break-in to 
police. 
After Dean told Mr. Nixon 
4)f 'Hunt's demand, according 
to'the Senate memorandum, 
The president said it was 
wrong, would not work and 
t.he truth would come out

o Dean then said, the memo-
randum continues, "that a 
'Cuban group could possibly

linents." No other mention of 
Ai. $1 million figure appears, 
tyl, the White House version 
bf the Nixon-Dean meetings. 
v'The memorandum; made 
divailable to some newspa-
laers Wednesday and con-
firmed as authentic yester-
day by knowledgable 
cources, is the latest in a se-
les of leaks this week con-
Oerning Dean's forthcoming 
Yestimony before the Senate 
pelect committee on the 
Watergate affair. 
Dean had been scheduled 
to testify this week, but his 
appearance was put off until 
hext week because of the 
visit of Soviet Communist 
party General Secretary Le; 
Odd Brezhnev. 
The purpose of the leaks 
Cs not clear. Some are evi-
dently designed to discredit 
Dean's testimony; others 
may be intended to bolster 
his credibility; still others 
may have been leaked he-
alms? of internal political 
friction within the Senate 
Watergate committee itself. 
In any event, the general in-
tention of the leaks appears 
to be to influence public 
,inion about Dean in ad- 
varice of his nationally tele-'ised appearance next week. 
The Senate committee's 
memorandum about the 
Dean-Nixon meetings began 
with the committee's re-
quest of White House logs 
of the sessions after the 
publication of Dean's allega-
tions about what went on 
there. The White House 
turned over a seven-page 
listing of the dates, times 
and place of the meetings, 
along with who else was 
there and, in a Jew cases, 
what was discussed. 
An response to the corn-
inittee's request for more 
detailed information, White 
House officials, including 
Leonard Garment, the pres-
ent White House counsel, 
and J. Fred Buzhardt, the 
President's special counsel,' 
orally described the sessions 
fOr committee staff. 
.-White House officials ref-
Used to comment yesterday 
on the substance of the Sen-, 
ate committee's memoran-
dum, as it appeared in the 
press, saying it is based on 
the interpretation made by 
the Senate staff members of 
what Garment, Buzhardt 
and others told them. 
The memorandum begins 
With a meeting September 
15, 1972, the date of the in-
dictments of the seven 
Waterg a t e conspirators: 
"Dean reports on (Internal: 
Revenue Service) IRS inves-
tigation of Larry (Lawrence 
F.) O'Brien (then the chair-
man of the Democratic 
Party). Dean reported on 
Watergate indictments." 
(O'Brien, reacting yester-
day to the disclosure that 
IRS was conducting an in-
vestigation of him, corn-. 
mented: "I have been sub-
jeetqd to intensive scru-
tiny by the IRS since 1970 
upon my return as Demo-
cratic national chairman. Up 
to this point I had no reason 
td believe that the audits 
were on anything but the 
merits, now I'm not sure." 
(An O'Brien associate said, 
that O'Brien had to hire a 
law-yer and accountant to 
deal with the IRS audit and 
the cost to him in fees was 
about $10,000. The result of 
the audit was an adjustment 
upward in O'Brien's taxes of 
a few hundred dollars). 
On Feb.' 28, 1973, the mem-
orandum -continues. "Presi-
dent inquired of Watergate; 
Dean said no White House 
involvement." Dean added 
that Nixon associates men-
tioned in connection with 
Watergate, including then 
special counsel Charles W. 
Colson and Maurice H. Stans, 
the Nixon campaign's chief 
fund-raiser, were victims of 
circumstance. "Dean sug-
gested," according to the 
memorandum, "they make 
sure that wiretaps of previous 
years (other administrations) 
be made known." 
On March 1, the President 
was preparing for a press 
, conference: "Was decided 
the question would come up 
as to. why Dean was sitting, 
in on FBI interviews and 
that reason was he was con-
ducting an investigation for4 
? the President. President; 
asked Dean to write a re-' 
I port. Dean was also' critical, 
of Gray (a reference to L. 
Patrick Gray III, then acting 
FBI director.) 
On Mareh 13, the memo-
randum goes on, the Presi-
dent again asked about the 
Involvement in Watergate of 
specific White House and 
campaign officials. For the 
first time, Dean said that 
Gordon Strachan, an aide to 
then White House chief of 
.staff H. R. (Bob) Haldeman 
could have been involved. 
March 17: ? "Dean again 
suggested they bring out the 
1968 bugging and President 
said (then Attoney General 
Richard) Kleindienst had ad-
vised against it. Several 
names were discussed ea 
possibly subject to attack: 
Colson, Haldeman, 
Ehrhich-
man, (former Attorney Gen-
eral and Nixon campaign di-
;rector John N.) Mitchell and, 
Dean. 
The President asked Dean 
point-blank if he knew about 
the planned break-in in ad-
vance. Dean said no, there 
was no actual White House 
involvement regardless of 
appearances except possibly 
Strachan. Dean told PreSi-
sient (that deputy campaign 
director Jeb Stuart) Magru-
der pushed (Watergate con-
spirator G. Gorden) Liddy 
hard but that Haldeman was 
not involved." 
. March 20: "The President 
called Dean' that night and 
Dean said there was 'not a 
scintilla of evidence' to indi-
cate White House Involve-
ment and Dean suggested 
he., give the President a 
more in-depth briefing of 
what had transpired." 
, That call set the stage, 
according to the memoran-
dum, for the meeting on 
March 21 when the Presi-
dent first learned of the 
probable involvement of his 
close associates in the 
Watergate affair, It was that 
meeting the President was 
apparently referring to 
when on April 17 he said he 
had learned important new 
facts about the case on 
March 21. 
Two days later, Watergate 
conspirator James W. Mc-
Cord Jr. made his cele-
brated accusation before 
U.S. District Court Judge 
John J. Sirica that, perjury 
had been committed at the 
Watergate trial In January 
and political pressure ap-
plied on the defendants to 
keep them silent. Following 
McCord's public letter, dis-
closures about those in-

volved in the Watergate in 
creased markedly. 
There had been specula., 
tion that it was McCord's 
letter that forced the White' 
House to confront the 
Watergate affair, but ac-: 
cording to the Senate memo-
randum,,Dean finally "gave 
the President his theory of 
what had happened" on 
March 21 and from then on 
the President moved quickly, 
to deal With the situation. 
? 
"lie (Dean) still said no 
prior June 17 White 'House 
knowledge," the memoran-
dum states, "that Magruder' 
;probably knew, that Mitch-
ell probably knew that 
Strachan Probably knew,. 
that Haldeman had possibly 
seen the fruits of the wire-
taps through Strachan, that 
Ehrlichman was vulnerable 
? because of his approval' 
of (Herbert W.) Kalm-
bach's (fund-ral,sing activity)., 
[Kalmbach was then the , 
President's personal lawyer!t 
who had allegedly raised 
hush money for the Water-: 
gate defendants], Colson 
had made the call to Magru-
der (urging him to approve 
a Liddy Intelligence plait)." , 
Then came the discussion . 
, about Hunt's demand for" 
t more money. "Dean said 
Colson had talked to Hunt 
about executive clemency,", 
the memorandum gees on. 
"Dean said nothing of his 
role In regard to the cover-
up money .. . This informa-
tion was gone over twice,! 
the last time in Haldeman's 
f' preSepCe. 
' "Later that afternoon it 
was tentatively decided that 
everyone would go to the 
grand jury, however, Dean, 
, wanted immunity. Halde-
man suggested that they 
!write the whole thing out, 
and release it from the 
White House. Ehrlichman 
said there should be no ex-
ecutive privilege claim and 
that no one should ask for 
immunity. The President' 
told them to discuss these 
matters with Mitchell." 
On March 23, the memo-. 
randum says, the President) 
told Dean to go to Camp,, 
,David and on March 30' 
"after it became obvious'. 
Dean would write no report 
the President directed Ehrl-e? 
ichman to investigate." 
The final meeting was on' 
April 16: "The President. 
asks Dean to resign. Had' 
two drafts, prepared for 
Dean's signature. Dean de-,, 
manded Haldeman and Ehr1.-. 
ichman resign also." 
On April 30, the President, 
'ordered Dean to submit his 
resignation?which Dean' 
did?but the two did not! 
meet that day. 
NEW YORK TIMES

'Hunt Said to get $72,000 
After aThreat to 'Tell All' 
By SEYMOUR M. HERSH 
Special to The New York Thee 
WASHINGTON, June 21?E, ing the Hunt message contain-
Howard Hunt Jr. received a ing the money demand. "Dean 
final cash payment of $72,000 
in mid-March after he had 
warned John D. Ehrlichman 
that he was ready to "tell all" 
about the White House opera-
tions against Dr. Daniel Ells-
berg in 1971, sources close to 
the Watergate case said today. ? 
The warning, the sources 
said, was Included In a letter 
that Hunt sent to John W. Dean 
3d,- the former White House 
?counsel, for relay to Mr. Ehr-
lichman, then President Nixon's 
domestic affairs adviser. 
"He said 'Pass this along to 
Ehrlichman,'" according to a 
person who has seen the mes-
sage. This source added that 
r 
Hunt' who was given a pro-
visional 35-year jail term on 
March 23 for his role in the 
Watergate break-in in June, 
1972, demanded a payment of 
$72,000 for himself and $50,000 
for attorney fees. 
A few days before the letter 
was sent, another source said, 
Hunt told a former White House 
official that he was planning to 
write a book abut Watergate 
unless he got more money. The 
Washington Post reported last 
week that the former Central 
Intelligence Agency official had 
received more than $200,000 at 
the time of his renewed request. 
Hunt, along with G. Gordon 
Liddy, the leader of the Water-
gate break-in team has been 
linked to the attempted bur-
glary of the Los Angeles office 
of Dr. Ellsberg's psychiatrist in 
September, 1971. At the time, 
the two men were members of 
a special investigations unit 
that was set up under Mr. Ehr-
ichman inside the White House 
after the publication of the Pen-
tagon papers in June, 1971. 
On Sunday, The New York 
Times reported that Mr. Dean 
was prepared to tell the Sen., 
ate -Watergate committee in 
his televised testimony that he 
was told that President Nixon 
had authorized the break-in of 
'the office of Dr. Ellsbergl 
psychiatrist ' 
Mr. Dean referred indirectly 
to the Hunt letter in his private 
testimony before the ,Senate 
Watergate committee last Sato 
i 
,urday. Excerpts from that tes-
timony were published in The 
New York Times today. 
According to the summary. 
which was signed by Samuel 
Approv tett:treterritO tkOOP/013007 : CIA-RDP77-00432n00100180001-7 
an tote ot mew-
told Ehrlichman," the summary 
continued, "and Ehrlichman 
told Dean to call [former At-
torney General John N.] Mit-
chell." 
Package Delivered 
"f he ;summary then quoted 
Mr. Dean as saying that on 
March 21 or March 22 of this 
year, "Ehrlichman asked Mit-
chell if Hunt's problem had 
been taken care of, and Mitchell 
said 'Yes.'" 
A nutnber of sources con-
firmed today that on either 
:March 20 or March 2l?days 
on which key White House ad-
visers were discussing Water-
gate With President Nixon?a 
package containing $72,000 was 
delivered by Frederick C. La 
Rue to the office of William 0. 
Bittman, Hunt's attorney. 
Mr. LaRue has been identi-
fied as the recipient of more 
than $400,000 in cash that was 
ultimately used to 'help to fi-
nance the elaborate cover-up 
that began with cash payreents 
in late summer of last year. 
Both Mr. Dean and Mr. Ehr-
lichman have been ,repeatedly 
linked to payments reportedly 
made to the seven Watergate 
;defendants in return for their 
;silence, 
The 'General Accounting Of-
fice reported last month that 
at least $210,000 was raised 
,last year by Herbert W. Kalm-
bach, President Nixon's former 
personel attorney and a leading 
campaign fund-raiser. Investi-
gators have determined that 
other cash was taken from a 
secret $350,000 campaign fund 
that was set up in April, 1972, 
in the office of H. R. Halde-
man, the former White House 
'chief of staff. 
Special Bank Account 
? In August, 1972, Mr. LaRue 
reportedly received $70,000 in 
;cash taken from the safe of 
Maurice H. Stans, the chairman 
of the Republican finance com-
mittee, for payoff purposes. In 
November, according to the 
published grand jury testimony 
of Gordon C. Strachan, then an 
aide to Mr. Haldeman, the en-
tire $350,000 cash fund was 
taken to Mr. LaRue's apart-
ment. 
Sources close to Mr. LaRue,' 
lwho is now believed to be co-
loperating with Federal prosecu-
tors in the 'case, said -that he 
had since placed the unused, 
cover-up funds?totaling more 
than $112,000 ? in a special 
bank account. He also returned 
some cash to representatives 
of Mr. Stens, who served as the 
chief Republican fund-raiser in 
the campaign, sources said. 
Mr. LaRue will keep the cash 
in the bank, a friend said to-
day, "until he finds somebody 
to take it back." 
Some sources said today 
that they were puzzled by the 
discrepancy between the $122,-
000 sought by Hunt in his mes-
sage to Mr. Dean and the 
$72,000 that was eventually 
provided him. 
"They wouldn't dare bargain 
with a guy who's going to plow 
them out of the water," one 
lawyer close to the case said. 
The lawyer suggested that some 
of the cash had been 
"skimmed" by the participants 
in the payoff scheme. 
According to the official 
White House version of the 
meetings between the President 
rod Mr. Dean which was pro.,
%.icied to the Senate this week 
and also published today in?Thel 
New York Times, Mr. Nixon; 
was told of the Hunt demand 
on March 21. 
The summary quoted Mr.. 
Dean as stating to the Presi-.

re k-14 at Bremer Home' ' 
By Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein 
WaAhington Posts:it:al Writern 
About an hour after the atterfipt to as-, 
?sassinate Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace-
' last year, special presidential counsel. 
Charles W. Colson ordered E. Howard 
Hunt 'Jr. to fly immediately to Milwaukee 
and illegally break into the tipartment of 
Wallace's suspected assailant, according to . 
accounts of sworn testimony by Hunt. 
Colson told Hunt to bring back informa-
tion from the apartment of the suspect, , 
,Arthur H. Bremer, that might be useful in 
linking Bremer to left-wing political ? 
causes, according to the accounts of Hunt's 
tesilniony, 
Hunt, then a White House consultant,: 
said he never went to Milwaukee; He told. 
Colson he could not get there soon enough. 
to commit the burglary without running a; 
high risk of. getting caught, according to 
. accounts of recent testimony by ,Hunt to a j 
closed-door session of the Senate's Water-
gate investigating committee. 
Colson categorically denied to The Wash-
ington Post that he had ordered Hunt to.? 
Milwaukee for any purpose. 
Mint's attorney, William 0. Bittman,? 
confirmed on Tuesday that Hunt told Sen-
ate investigators that he ? was ordered by 
Colson to bring back information from 
Milwaukee about Bremer, the 21-year-old 
busboy who has since been convicted in 
the May 15, 1972, Wallace assassination 
attempt. 
? "There is no question;" Batman said,-
"that there was testimony about that . 
Colson asked him (Hunt) to go to Milwau-
kee and go into Bremer's apartment 
I don't have a clear recollection of the 
reason why he was to go out there. I don't' 
.., ? 
?recall whether the word 
break-in was involved." 
Hunt, a former CIA agent,' 
pleaded guilty in January to: 
all charges against him ih, 
;:the. NVatergate conspiracy': 
'and is now serving a 35-year 
'provisional jail sentence. 
Within hours of the Wal-
lace assassination attempt, a' 
'White House official was 
.asked by the Washington. 
Post about the Identity of 
the governor's attacker. Dur-
:ing a subsequent converse 
-
tion that evening, the 
of-
ficial raised the possibility 
of Bremer's connection . to 
leftist causes and the carri 
.paign of Sen. George McGov-
, ern, through literature found 
M his. apartment. 
? The Associated Press, in a 
dispatch that May night, 
quoted a source close to the 
: investigation as saying that 
,.scraps of paper found in 
Bremer's apartment "showed 
: he allied himself with 'left-
wing causes.'" 
On the evening of the 
Wallace shooting, reporters 
-said 
they were able to enter 
c the Bremer apartment 
during a 1?-hour period 
I. Shortly after the assassina-
tion attempt. 'Several said 
. they entered only after FBI 
Approved 
-agents had been there once 
and left, and that agents 
's later arrived at the apart-
ment again, sealed it off and 
thereafter refused to let. 
reporters enter. 
i ? The FBI, which ? moved 
Into the case immediately,. 
has never fully explained 
why Bremer's apartment 
was not guarded to prevent 
access to the apartment by' 
reborters. 
Among items found by re-
porters in Bremer's untidy 
apartment were a Black 
Panther newspaper, a book 
depicting comic strip eharac-
.t.ers performing sexual acts, 
a Confederate flag, some 
Wallace campaign liter 
a-
ture, two boxes of bUllets 
. and seven targets for pistol 
, shooting. . 
According to the accounts 
of Hunt's sworn testimony 
' to the Watergate committee, 
. Hunt said that after a tele-
phone call from Colson or-
dering him to Milwaukee, 
Hunt went to his home in 
Potomac, Md., 
Apparently.' In 'a second 
telephone conversation, 
ac-
cording to the accounts of 
his testimony, Hunt told 
, Colson that it would take. at 
least four hours to reach 
, Milwaukee, at which time 
13remer's apartment would, 
he staked out by the FBI?
thus making a successful 
. burglary impossible. 
After. that, the sources 
- said, Hunt testified the mis-' 
sion was aborted because it 
; was apparent that an illegal 
, entry, was clearly 
ble. 
, In denying that he asked 
Hunt to ,go. to Milwaukee,. 
Colson said it is "absolutely 
untrue and I'd' swear it is 
untrue under oath." ? 
: Colson. in a telephone call 
to The Washington Post last 
night, called the "charge ...: 
an s utterly preposterous 
'one." He said he did "not be-
lieve that it could be an ac-
curate report of any testi-
mony that the Senate com-
mittee has received." ? 
Colson said last night that 
It would be irresponsible "to 
take that (Hunt's testimony) 
seriously without checking 
the conditions" and "great 
duress" under which Hunt 
testified?a reference to an 
altercation between Hunt, 
and his - cellmate the night 
before Hunt appeared be-
fore the Senate committee 
on June 11. 
Hunt's attorney. Bittman, 
said last night that Hunt 
had only three houra sleep 
"In a day and half" before 
he appeared before the com-
mittee and that he (Rittman) 
had therefore asked the 
For Release 2001/08/07 : CIA-RDP77-0043iR000100180001-7 
'committee for permission to 
treview the record of Hunt's. 
"testimony and amend it 
later, if necessary. Bittman' 
,said he and Hunt had not, 
yet reviewed the testimony . 
and that "there is always 
the possibility for mistakes" 
under what he called "the 
unfortunate timing of Mr. 
!Hunt's appearance." 
Colson provided .a re-
porter A copy of A memo 
.dated dune 20, 11372, five 
weeks after the -Wallace 
'shooting and the day that 
Hunt's possible involvement 
in the Watergate operation 
was first made public. In the. 
memo, title "memorandum 
for the files," Colson said: 
"I also talked to him 
(Hunt) on the telephone I he 
night Governor Wallace was 
shot simply to ask for his re-
actions on what :he thought 
might have been the cause? 
of the attempted ? assassina-
tion. (Hunt was known .of 
something of an expert of - 
psychological warfare and 
motivations when in the 
CIA.)" 
Colon said he provided a, 
copy of the metrui to then 
presidential counsel John 
W. Dean III on Aug. 29. In a 
covering memo to Dean, 
however, Colson said "I can-
not be sure that my memory 
is all that precise." 
After checking White 
House logs, Colson said 
Tuesday that he had dinner 
with the President the, night 
of the Wallace assassination 
attempt and could not have 
talked to Hunt until after 
10:45 p.m. Colson 'said it 
would have been wholly il-
logical for him to order 
Hunt to Milwaukee at that 
hour when there were no 
planes and the FBI should 
have been swarming all 
over Bremer's apartment. 
(Hunt's testimony places 
the order from Colson about 
an hour after the 4 p.m. as-
sassination attempt.) 
-In addition, Colson said 
that he was in regular con-
tact that night with ANsist-
lant FBI Director W. Mark 
Felt, urging Felt 'to insure 
that the FBI was on the.. 
case fully: "Would it have 
been logical for me to push' 
In the FBI and simultane-
ously order Hunt to Milwau-
kee?" Colson asked. 
FBI sources said that the 
FBI moved. immediately into 
the case before receiving 
word from the White 
House, hut confirmed that 
Colson had talked several 
times with Felt. The Presi-
dent asked for a personal 
FBI briefing every :30 min-
utes the evening of. May 1.5 
on developments in the ease,' 
the?sources said. 
Senate soUrees said they 
place a different interpreta-
tion on Colson's June 20, 
1972, memo for the, files. 
One Senate attorney said, 
"The NVateissate had blown, 
S 
?Approved For Release 2001/08/07 : CIA-RDP77-00432R000100180001-7 
Hunt was going to be nailed 
and Colson writes a memo 
for his files to get his ver-
sion down on paper of all the 
other expeditions Hunt had 
done/for the White House." , 
. In the three-page Colson 
memo, Colson attempts gen-
erally to dissociate himself 
from ?11u.nt's activities, in- , 
eluding the Watergate oper-
ation. 
Gov. Wallace, a candidate 
for the Democratic presiden-, 
tial nomination at the time, 
of the attempt on his life, 
Nixon's chief aide in foreign 
affairs. 
' Colson denied making the 
,fire-bombing suggestion to) 
.Caulfield, and an associate of 
Colson .said such a remark 
might have been made as a 
? "joke." Colson has acknowl-? 
edged attencitng a discussion 
among other White. House 
aides about the possibility 
of retrieving information 
from the Brookings Institu-
tion by unspecified means. 
' Last week, Jeb Stuart'MaA"

Md.o ? the Senate committee that

'that Colson knew of plans to 
bug the Watergate before 
Democratic headquarters 
were placed under illgal

According to Magruder's 
testimony, Colson called 
'him during February "and

Liddy's plans"?a reference

or the-Nixon campaign. 
If such a tie existed, the 
source said, the President 
Indicated it could cost hint

less than six months away. , 
' ' "The President was agi-

the source said:

sent the third time in recent 
weeks that. Colson's name? 
has figured in reports -of. 
'burglaries that purportedly 
'were planned or carried out 
.under White House supervi-
sion. 
In the first instance, Hunt. 
,told the Watergate grand 
jury that, after returning; 
:from the 1971 break-in at 
? 
'the office of Daniel Ells-, 
,berg's psychiatrist in Los 
Angeles, he went to Colson's 
office .with , photographs 
taken during the burglary. 
"I have something that 
might be of interest to ? you," 
Hunt testified he told Col-. 
son, adding: "It has to do 
with my activities this past 
weekend." 
. According to. Hunt's testi-i 
,mony, Colson told him "I' 
don't want to hear anything ? 
, about them". and left the 
room. , 
In the other Instance, 
John J. Caulfield, a White 
!House intelligence opera= 
tive, told federal prosecu-
tors that Colson had sug-
gested to him that he bur-

l'E NEW YORK TIMES, SATURDAY 'JUNE 23,1973 
McCord Says HeAlertegC.I.A. 
To Scapegoat Plan in Break-1n 
By MAJORIE HUNTER 
Special to TM New York Times 
WASHINGTON, June 22 ? 
James McCord Jr. ,one of the 
convicted Watergate conspira-
tors ,said today, that he had 
alerted the director of Central 
Intelligence last yea1 that ef-
forts were being mane to get 
the agency to take the blame 
for the Watergate- break-in. , 
McCord said that he issued 
his warning in a letter to Rich-
ard M. Helms, at that time 
director of the agency and now 
Ambassador to Iran. 
The Helms letter, he said, 
was one of seven that he had. 
sent to officials of the ageocy 
;between' July 29 of last year 
and Jan. 5 of this year. 
"I felt that an attempt was 
being made to wrongfully lay 
the blame for Watergate on 
the C.I.A.," he said. 
McCord spoke as he emerged 
from three hours of question-
ing by the House Armed 
Services subcommittee on In-
telligence Operations, which is 
looking into the agency's in-
affair.. 
, The session was closed, but 
both McCord and the subcom-
mittee chairman, Representa-
tive Lucien N. Nedzi, Democrat 
of Michigan, ? confirmed that 
McCord had discussed the let-
ters extensively during his 
testimony. 
That earliest letter, sent to 
Mr. Helms, was signed "Jim" 
but the others were unsigned, 
according to Mr. McCord. 
Asked why he had not signed 
the others, McCord said that 
be "wanted to be sure" his 
name would not be generally 
known "in case the letters got 
out of channels." 
McCord had worked as a 
C.I.A. agent for some 20 years 
before retiring several years be-
ore the Watergate break-in 
last June 17. At the time of the 
Watergate affair, he was secu. 
rity officer for the Republican 
re-election committee. 
Officials of the agency had! 
told the Nedzi subcommittee; 
several weeks ago that letters 
believed to have been written 
by Mc-Cord had been received, 
but that nothing had been done 
about them because various 
persons who read them as-
sumed "the other guy" would 
take some action. 
McCord said today that he 
had mentioned the name of his 
former attorney,. Gerald Alch, 
as being among those who had 
suggested to him that the 
agency shoulder the blame. I 
"I don't recall specifically if " 
others were mentioned In the 
letters," he said. 
McCord had testified before 
the Senate Watergate com-
mittee in May ? that Mr. Alch 
had suggested to him that 
James Schlesinger, who suc-
ceeded Mr. Helms as C.I.A. di-
rector, would "go along" with 
a plan to have the agency say 
that McCord was on its pay-
roll at the time of the break-in. 
Mr. Schlesinger later denied 
any knowledge of such a plan. 
Representative Nedzi said 
that McCord told the subcom-
mittee today that he first sus-
pected efforts to involve the 
C.I.A. last summer after a con-
versation he had with Mrs. E 
Howard Hunt Jr., wife of an-
other Watergate conspirator 
"He was vague about what 
she had told him," Mr. Nedzi 
said, "but he said it planted a 
definite suspicion in his mind." 
Mrs. Hunt was killed in the 
crash of an airplane over 'Chi-
cago. She had $10,00 in cash 
in het purse at the time. 
The Nedzi subcommittee 
hopes to explore this matter 
further by questioning Hunt, 
who has been subpoenaed for 
questioning next Thursday. He 
has not appeared before any 
of the Congressional panels in-
vestigating the Watergate af-
fair.

By Fred Barnes 
Star-NMI/Staff Writer 
The special Senate Water-
gate committee has decided 
to investigate the possible 
involvement of the Central 
Intelligence Agency in the 
Watergate affair. . 
Staff members for com-
mittee, which is to resume 
its public hearings next 
week, have already begun 
work in preparation for 
calling witnesses to testify 
about any CIA link, sources 
said. 
? Specifically, these steps 
have been taken: 
O The committee has re-
quested the transcripts of 
closed-door hearings of a 
Senate Appropriations sub-
committee which looked 
into the CIA matter. The 
subcommittee agreed yes-
? terday to provide the tran-
scripts. 
O Committee staffers are 
drawing up a list of likely 
witnesses for the CIA probe 
which includes Gen. Vernon 
Walters, the deputy director 
of the agency, and Gen. 
Robert Cushman, his prede-
cessor in that job. 
O A Senate Armed Serv-
ices subcommittee has 
handed over to the Water-' 
gate committee a collection 
of classified documents 
which it had obtained in the 
course of its own CIA in-
quiry. 
Walters and Cushnian are 
not included on the list of 
Watergate witnesses which 
the committee released ear-
lier, nor is former CIA 
director Richard Helms,

another potential witness. 
? But the list includes sev-
eral witnesses who are now 
'expected to be questioned 
by the committee about 
possible CIA involvement as 
well as about other' Water-p 
gate matters. 
These are former acting 
FBI director L. Patrick 
Gray and one-time White 
House aides John W. Dean 
III, John L. Ehrlichman, H. 
R. Haldeman, Egil Krogh, 
David Young and Charles 
Colson. 
Walters, Cushman and 
Helms have already testi-
fied before one or more of 
the three congressional 
subcommittees, two in the 
Senate and one in the 
House, which have been 
ilooking into the CIA ques-
tion in recent weeks. 
By MARJORIE HUNTER 
spevii,i to The New York Throes 
?WASHINGTON, June 19?
Charleg W. Colson, a former 
White House aide, told a Sen-
ate panel today that he had 
personally asked John D. 
Ehrlichman to help E. Howard 
Hunt Jr. establish "liaison with 
the C.I.A." in the summer of 
1971. 
Mr. Colson's testimony would 
seem to refute the recent denial 
by Mr. Ehrlichman, the former 
top Nixon domestic aide, that 
he had made any approach to 
the Central Intelligence Agency 
to ask that Hunt be given what-
ever assistance he might need 
Approved 
THOUGH THE hearings 
have been in executive ses-
sion, a series of revelations 
have emerged from them 
which have fueled specula-
tion about a CIA link te the 
Watergate. 
Among other things, a 
memorandum written a 
year ago by Walters was 
disclosed in which he said 
that Haldeman, then chief 
of the White House staff, 
had ordered him to inter-
fere with the FBI'S investi-
gation of the Watergate 
case. 
And Cushman told the 
Senate Appropriations sub-
committee that Ehrlichman 
called him in 1971- to clear 
the way for E. Howard Hunt 
to make contact with the 
that summer. 
But it supported testimony 
made recently by Gen. Robert 
E. Cuashman Jr., commandant 
of the United States Marine 
Corps. 
Hunt had been employed 
that summer by the White 
House as a member of a special 
team ? dubbed "the plumb-
ers"?created to track down 
leaks of sensitive national 
security information, including 
the Pentagon papers detail-
ing American involvement in 
Southeast Asia. 
Using a wig and various 
other equipment supplied to 
him by the C.I.A., Hunt was 
subsequently involved in bur-
glarizing the Califorinia office 
of the former psychiatrist to Dr. 
Daniel Ellsber.g, the principal 
defendant in the Pentagon pa-
pers trial. 
Hunt was also later convicted 
of conspiracy in the break-in at 
Democratic national headquar-
ters in the Watergate complex 
on June 17, 1972. 
Mr: Colson's testimony today 
appeared to deepen the mys-
tery of White House efforts to 
involve the C.I.A. ..in domestic 
For Release 2001/08/07 
CIA. 
At the time, Hunt was a? 
member of a special White 
House team?the "plum-
bers"?which was assigned 
to track down leaks of sensi-
tive national.security infor-
'nation. 
Later in 1971, Hunt was 
able to get in touch with 
, CIA officials, and he ob-
tained equipment from 
them that was reportedly 
used in the September 1971 
burglary of the office of 
Daniel Ellsberg's psychia-
trist in Los Angeles. 
EHRLICHMAN, however, 
has denied that he ever 
talked to Cushman about 
allowing Hunt access to CIA 
officials. The Watergate 
committee is expected to 
attempt to clear up this con-
flict in testimony. 
Haldeman, too, has de-
nied the allegation against 
him, saying that he never 
sought to have the CIA 
block the FBI investigation 
of the Watergate break-in. , 
Sen. John L. McClellan, 
D-Ark., said yesterday he 
has concluded from his 
Appropriations subcommit-
tee's CIA probe that the 
agency has acted improper-
ly in involving itself in do-
mestic affairs. 
According to the law 
which established the agen-
cy, the CIA is supposed to 
deal only in intelligence 
matters related to foreign 
affairs. 
McClellan said that his 
subcommittee has compiet-
activities, both before and after 
the Watergate affair. 
During a two-hour appear-
ance before the Senate Appro-
priations Subcommittee on In-
telligence Operations, 'Mr. Col-
son testified: ? 
"On the 7th or possibly the 
8th of July [which would have 
been by phone] I told Mr. -Ehr-
lichman that Mr. Hunt wanted 
to establish liaison with the? 
C.I.A. as well as with other 
Government agencies. 
"The need for contact with 
the C.I.A. was immediate in 
that one of Mr. Hunt's first 
assignments was to interview, 
a Lieut. Col. Lucien Conein.' 
who had been a principal

period of the Diem coup (in 
South Vietnam)." 
Previous testimony by C.I.A. 
officials had made no mention 
of Hunt's interest in Colonel 
Conein during his initial ef-
forts to obtain assistance from 
the intelligence agency.

IN THE FINAL session 
yesterday, the subcommit-
tee questioned Colson for 
more than two hours. Col-
-son revealed at the hearing 
that he had acted in 1971 to 
clear the way for Hunt to 
contact a top CIA agent. 
He said that he spoke to 
Ehrlichman about Hunt's 
interest in talking to the 
agent, Lt. Col. Lucien Co-

why Hunt wanted to contact 
Concin, whose field of ex-

that Hunt talked, to him "some-

Colonel Conein said that he 
told Hunt he had had no con-

1967 and knew nothing about 
the Pentagon papers. ' 
Colonel Conein was the 
C.I.A.'s liaison with the group 
of Vietnamese generals who

South Vietnam, in 1963. Mt?,

As Unfair to Nixon 
Special to TN Nrer 'for* Timms 
WASHINGTON, June 15?A 
British journalist accused the 
American press today Of failing 
to discharge its duty to be 
fair to the President" in the 
Watergate affair. 
"The press of the United 
States has a duty to be fairlo 
the President," William Rees-
Mogg, editor of The Time's of 
London, said in a speech at the 
National Press Club. But the 
nation's press, taken together 
and not individually, is not dis-
charging that duty, he said. 
The 44-year-old Mr. Rees-
Mogg, tn an editorial in The 
Times on June 5, described the 
President as in the "unenviable 
position of being tried by his 
fellow countrymen in three 
different forums"? the Senate 
Watergate committee, the 
WEItergate grand jury and the 
press. 
Mr. Rees-Mogg accused the 
press of failing to give credit 
to Mr. Nixon for his "major 
contributions" in foreign af-
fairs. "The press is not willing 
to give credit where credit. is 
due," he said.

In a question-and-answer 
session after his talk, Mr. Rees-
Mogg said that the "role of a 
fair trial is even more funda-
mental than a free press." - 
"The press cannot claim that

Disclosure of that memo by 
Jack Anderson, the columnist, 
on Feb. 29, 1972, was the 
ocasion for the reopening of 
hearings by the Senate Judi 
ciary Committee on the nomi-
nation of Richard G. 
Kleindienst to be Attorney Gen-
eral. ? 
During the two months of 
hearings, high Administration 
officials denied that an out-of-
Court settlement that allowed 
I.T.T. to retain the Hartford 
Fire Insurance Company in re-
turn for divestiture of several 
other companies was related in 
any way to the I.T.T. pledge 
of up to $400,000 in support 
for the Republican National 
Convention then planned , for 
San Diego. 
'Noble Commitment' Cited 
Mrs. Beard had written her 
superior, William R. Merriam, 
vice president in charge of 
I.T.T.' s Washington office, that 
"our noble commitment has 
gone a long way toward our 
negotiations on the mergerl 
coming out as Hal [Harold S. 
Geneen, I.T.T. president] wants 
them." 
After the memo was 
disclosed, Mrs. Beard disap- ? 
peared from sight for several 
days. She was discovered in 
a Denver hospital under treat-
ment for a heart attack. Later 
her attorney there, David Flem-
ing, issued a statement by her 
that the Anderson memo was 
fraudulent, although some of 
Its phrasing was identical to 
a memo she had actually writ-
ten.

conspirator, had gone to Denver

The question Of authenticity 
"had become critical for the 
Administration," Mr. Colson 
said, because the memo had 
become "central to whether 
Kleindienst would be. con-
firmed." 
Mr. Colson said he Was firmly 
convinced now that the Ander-
son memo was not authentic. 
He gave as his reasons the fact 
that Mrs. Beard's secretary had 
denied typing it, that Mr. Mer-
riam had never seen it, and that 
"the most incriminating sen-
tences were non sequiturs." 
Later, Intertel, a concern of 
private investigators, said first 
that the Anderson -memo had 
not been typed on Mrs. Beard's 
typewriter. Intertel later said 
the memo had been typed on 
her typewriter, but that its 
authenticity was doubted. The 
Federal Bureau of Investigation 
had obtained the Anderson 
memo, which was an original 
copy, and stated that it had 
been typed on Mrs. Beard's 
typewriter and roughly on the 
date at the top, June 24, 1971, 
Mr. Colson told the subcom-
mittee that he had seen the 
copy given by the Senate com-
mittee to the F.B.I., and that 
John W. Dean 3d, the White 
House counsel, had shown it 
to him. He said he did not know 
how Mr. Dean had obtained it, 
but added that Mr. Dean was

'meeting .that . he and John D. 
a memo he had written to Mr. 
Colson and Henry C. Cashen, 
another partner, last April 13. 
In that memo, Mr. Morin had 
suggested that they "lean" on 
G. Bradford Cook, then chair-
man of the Securities and Ex-
change Commission, but since 
resigned, to get him to name 
King Mallory as S.E.C. general 
counsel. Mr. Morin proposed 
that they solicit influence from 
Mr. Ehrlichman, Kenneth Cole, 
'his deputy, and Jerry Jones, a 
White House aide in charge of 
recruiting for top Administra-
tion posts. 
"This is one of the chips we 
really should pick up, because 
It is a key job in the commis-
sion and one of extreme impor-
tance to us in representing our 
clients," Mr. Morin had writ-
ten. 
, Today Mr. Morin told the 
subcommittee that the memo 
was "a silly document" dictat-
ed "off the top of my head." 
He said that he had no idea of 
"placing" a general counsel at 
the S.E.C. who would be be-
holden to the firm, and that he 
was simply concerned ?to get 
Mr. Mallory in the post because 
of his qualifications for dealing 
with "antitrust problems" be-

Mr. Colson said that neither 
he nor Mr. Cashen ever did 
anything about the memo, al-
though Mr. Colson acknowl-

NEW YORK TIMES 
15 JUNE 1973 
Nixon Not Implicatec 
in the Conspiracy by-
Campaign Aide 
By WALTER RUGABER 
Special to The New York Times . 
WASHINGTON, June 14?jet ? 
Stuart Magruder, the formei 
deputy director of President 
Nixon's 1972 re-election cams 
paign, told a first-hand story 
today of how he and alio. 
high-ranking officials had Plot-
ted the bugging of the Demo. 
crats and then tried to covet 
it up. 
In 51/2 hours of nationally-
'televised testimony before the 
Senate Watergate committee, 
the 38-year-old Mr. Magruder 
confessed his own guilt and im-
plicated a number of former Ad-
ministration officials?includ-
ing John N. Mitchell, 'John W. 
Dean ad and H. R. Haldeman?
but not the President. 
Mr. Magruder said that Mr. 
Mitchell, a former Attorney 
General, and Mr. Dean, former 
White House counsel, had been 
among those who planned the 
Watergate bugging as part of 
a broader espionage campaign. 
He said that he told Mr. Halde-
man, the President's former 
'chief of staff, the full story 
last January. 
An Early Decision 
The cover-up et fort was de? 
cided on ahnost Immediately 
after the arrests on June 17, 
1972, of five men inside the 
Watergate headquarters of the 
Democratic National Commit-
tee, Mr. Magruder testified, and 
among those who knew that he 
would lie to authorities about 
the case were Mr. Mitchell, Mr. 
Dean ' and H. R. Haldemann, 
then the White House chief of 
,staff. a 
Mr. Magruder said .that he 
had felt the President had had, 
no knowledge of the spying op-
eration but added that he had 
been afraid Mr. Nixon's re-
election "would be probably. 
negated" if the story was re-
vealed. 
Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. 
. of Tennessee, the Republican 
vice chairman of the commit-
tee, asked Mr. Magruder wheth-
er the decision on concealing 
the truth should have been 
made by the President. . 
"Sir, I can't comment as to 
whether he did or did not or 
.was involved in it," Mr. Ma-
gruder testified. "I had no deal-
ings directly with the Presi-
dent." 
The tanned witness traced 
?for a closely listening. audience 
what he said was the develop-
ment of the conspiracy. He said 
that at one point it included 
plans to kidnap radicals and 
Approved 
entice Democrats with "call 
girls" operating on a yacht in 
Miami Beach. ? 
He said that a principal aim 
in wiretapping telephones at 
Watergate was to cripple politi-
cally Lawrence F. O'Brien, then 
Democratic National Chairman 
and a man "who could be very 
difficult in the coming cam-
paign." 
? ? Mr. Magruder, once a rising 
White House figure with large 
political ambitions, testfied 
readily, calmly and almost mat-
ter-of-factly about the eventa 
that finally broke his career. 
Scattered through his testi-
money were glimpses of the 
personal relatins and the 
stresses and conflicts that final-
ly led him to tell hisstory in 
mid-April to the United States 
Attorney's office here. 
He said, for example, that 
tensions shot up on March 23 
when Chief Judge John J. Sirica 
of the United States District 
Court here rad a letter from a 
convicted conspirator, James 
W. McCord. 
McCord has indicated that it 
was a picture of Mr. Magruder 
and his family, showing them 
in a relexed pose during the 
Wategate trial, that con-
tributed to his decision to tell 
what he knew about higher-ups 
in the plot. 
Mr. Magruder, once reported 
to be badly shaken by the im-
pending collapse of the cover-
up, said today that he had 
agreed to plead guilty to one 
count of conspiracy and to be-
come a prosecution witness in 
the trial of others. 
- He has been granted im-
munity from prosecutionon his 
testimony before the Senate, 
but this does not preclude 
criminal prosecution, and he 
told the committeetoday that 
"for those errors in judgment 
that I made, I take full re-
sponsibility." 
As early as September, 1971, 
Mr. Magruder began', there were 
discussions with Mr. Dean on 
political intelligence operations. 
The talk began in earnest in 
December. when G. Gordon 
Liddy arrived at the Commit-
tee for the Re-election of the 
President, he ,said. 
Liddy, convicted with Mc-
Cord in January, was to be the 
Nixon organization's lawyer, 
but Mr. Magruder testified that 
Liddy and Mr. Dean and un-
identified other people on the 
White House staff had been 
discussing a "broad-gauged in-
telligence plan." 
Projects Are Described 
On Jan. 27, 1972, Liddy pre-
sented his plan to Messrs. 
Mitchell, Dean and Magruder 
at a meeting in the then At-
torney General's office at the 
Department of Justice, Mr Ma-
gruder said. 
The projects included "wire-
tapping, electronic surveillance 
and photography [of .docu-
mental," Mr. Magruder said, 
and therewere plans "relating 
to the abduction of individu-
als." 
"Mr. Liddy had a plan where! 
the leaders [of radical groups]' 
would be abducted and de-
tained in a place like Mexico, 
and that they would -then be 
returned to this country at the 
For Release 2001/08/07: 
end of the convention," the Wit-
ness said. 
There were also the call girls, 
and Liddy "envisioned renting 
a yacht in Miami and having it 
set up for sound and photo-
graphs" during the Democratic 
National Convention there. 
All this would cost $1-mil-
lion, Mr. Magruder said, and 
"all three of us were appalled" 
at the "scope and size of the 
project." Mr. Mitchell was said 
to have told Liddy to "go back 
to the drawing boards and come 
up with a more realistic plan." 
The "general nature" of the 
first Liddy plan was relayed to 
Gordon C. Strachan, an assist-
ant to Mr. Haldeman who dealt 
with the President's political 
organization. 
The committee was voted to 
seek immunity for Mr. Strachan, 
but the Department of Justice 
has moved under the immunity 
statutes to delay his appear-
ance on Capitol Hill for 30 days. 
A $500,000 Plan 
Mr. Magruder said that he 
and Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Dean, 
gathered?again on Feb. 4, 1972, 
and that Liddy presented them 
with a $500,000 plan, trimmed 
of everything but wiretapping 
and photography. 
The four menn talked over 
prospective "targets," the wit-
ness said, and these included; 
the Democratic National Com-
mittee headquarters, the party's' 
convention headquarters at thei 
Fountaineblew Hotel in Miami 
Beach and Democratic Presi-
dential campaign offices. 
Either Mr. Mitchell or Mr. 
Dean?Mr: Magruder said he 
couldn't remember who it was 
?talked about the "potential 
for an entry" at the offices of 
Hank Greenspun, publisher of 
the Las Vegas Sun. He was 
thought to have "information 
relating to Senator [Edmund 
S.] Muskie, then a leading Pres-
idential contender. 
Samuel Dash, the commit-
tee's chief counsel, asked Mr. 
Magruder about the object of 
the plan. At the time, the wit-
ness said, there was concern 
about Mr. O'Brien. He ex-
plained: 
41 . I think there was a gen-
eral concern that if he was al-
lowed to continue as Demo-
cratic National Chairman?
because he was certainly their 
most professional, at least from 
our standpoint, their most pro-
fessional political operator?
that he could be very difficult 
in the coming campaign. So we 
had .hoped that information 
might discredit him." , 
Despite this increasing inter-
est, Mr. Magruder said. Mr. 
Mitchell still "just didn't feel 
comfortable" with the plan, 
even at the reduced level. But 
Liddy was encouraged to keep 
trying. 
Sometime after the Feb. 4 
meeting, Mr. Magruder testified 
he received a telephone call 
from Charles W. Colson, then 
special counsel to the President. 
'[He] called me one evening 
and asked me in a sense to . 
get off the stick and get the 
budget approved for Mr. Liddy's 
28 
CIA-RDP77-00432R000100180001-7 
plans, that we needed informa-
tion, particularly on Mr. 
O'Brien,' the witness said. "He 
did not mention . .. anything 
about wiretapping or espionage 
at that time. 
On March 30, 1972, Mr. 
Magruder said, he, took Liddy's 
third proposal to Key Bascayne, 
Fla., and discuSsed it wit hMr. 
Mitchell and Frederick S. Larue, 
an assistant to the former At-
torney General.. 
Liddy had cut the cost to 
$250,000, with the wiretapping 
and photography projects re-
tained. No one "particularly 
overwhelmed," Mr. Magruder 
said, but he quoted Mr. Mitchell 
as giving his approval as follows: 
"Okay, let's give him a quar-
ter of a million dollars, and 
let's see what he (Liddy] can 
come up with." Mr. Magruder 
came back to Washington "and 
notified the parties of Mr. 
Mitchell's approval." Liddy and 
Mr. Strachan were informed, 
the witness said. 
Mr. Mitchell has acknowl-
edged that the bugging plans 
were presented to him at vari-
ous times, but he has insisted 
that he disapproved them on 
each occasion. The former At-
torney General made no corn-
pent today. 
Mr. LaRue, a Jackson, Miss., 
businessman, has refused to 
talkk with reporters. He could 
not be reached today, nor could 
Mr. Strachan. Mr. Dean is ex-
pected to testify before the 
Senate committee next week. , 
The loss of the wiretapped 
conversations and photographs 
of documents in the Demo-
cratic files reached Mr. Magru-
der in two packages, the first 
one a week or so, after the 
,tap was installed in May. 
Mr. Mitchell was shown the 
illicitly gathered information 
at a morning meeting, Mr. Ma-
,gruder said, and the former 
Attorney General "reviewed 
the documents" and reacted 
las follows: 
I "He simply indicated that 
this was not satisfactory, and 
it was worthless and not worth 
the money that he [Liddy] had 
been paid for it. . ? There was 
no information relating to any 
of the subjects he hoped to 
receive...." 
'Lack of Substance' 
Mr. Strachan came over from 
the White House to examine 
the data, Mr. Magruder said, 
and he, too, talked about "the 
lack of substance" in them. 
A second tap at the Water-
gate worked, but the one on 
Mr. O'Brien's telephone did not, 
and early on the morning of 
June 17 five men under Liddy's. 
direction broke in again to re-
pair things. 
Mr. Magruder was in Los An-
geles when the news of the ar-
rests came through later that 
day. He was having breakfast 
at the Beverly Hills Hotel, and, 
Liddy called to say "there had, 
been a problem the night 
before." 
Mr. Haldeman called the next 
day, Mr. Magruder said, "and 
asked me the basic background 
of the break-in and what hap-
pened." The White House ad-
viser said "I should get back 
-to Washington Immediately," 
Ithe witness added.

the annual appearance on 
Capitol Hill of the late J. 
Edgar Hoover. 
But the Watergate scandal 
has brought egg to Its face 
and demoralization to its 
ranks. The bureau has been 
accused of leaking like a 
sieve, relaxing surveillance 
of domestic subversives and 
turning its back on the rest 
of the intelligence commu-
nity.

Times Stet/ Writer 
? The controversial "en-
'skids" apparently spell out 
in specific terms just what 
authority is granted for 
covert operations overseas 
and just what the CIA can 
do in the 'United States?
even though ,the National 
Security Act specifies that 
the agency is not. to he in-
volved in intelligence acti-
vities at home. 
Disclosures in the 
Watergate scandal have 
resulted in new concern 
that Congress has failed to 
properly oversee CIA; 
operations. 
Publication of secret 
White House documents 
last week revealed that a 
1970 intelligence plan?, 
approved by President 
,Nixon, then canceled five. 
days later?involved the 
CIA in discussions of a 
widespread scheme for, 
spying on domestic "tar-'` 
gets." 
. Though memorandums 
Written by White House 
aide Tom Charles Huston 
cited the cooperation of 
then-CIA Director Richard 
Helms in putting together 
the plan, some sources' 
argue that the documents 
. failed to show that the 
CIA had agreed to become 
:involved in the. White 
House operations for 
domestic spying. 
Nevertheless, a former 
CIA analyst who is now an 
'intelligence expert on Ca-
pitol Hill said, "Helms 
never should have partici-
pated in discussions like 
that, and when the subject 
was raised he. should have 
walked out." 
According to sources fa-
miliar with operations of 
the agency, the CIA's acti-
vities in the United States 
include recruitment of and 
.assistance to students 
from "Third World" coun-
tries attending colleges 
and universities. 
Such activities are 
termed "building future 
assets," establishing rela-

stand to become figures in

WASHINGTON ? The 
Central Intelligence Agen-
cy, precluded by Congress 
26 years ago from engag-
lag in domestic opera-
,tions, operates under a 
top - secret charter from 
.the President's National 
'Security Council that may 
directly conflict with its 
congressional mandate. 
The secret charter, in 
the form of National Se-
curity Council Intelligence 
'Directives, or "enskids," is 
.known only to a few high-
level operatives in the in-
t elli gence bureaucracy 
and fewer, if any, mem-
bers of Congress. -

"T h e secret charter," . 
said a congressional ex-
pert on CIA operations, "is: 
a. curse. 
"We must have publicly 
?confirmed what authority 
'is given to the intelligence 
community in this coun-
try." 
chest loyalists concede that* 
the bureau was not keeping 
step with the violent politi-
cal activism in the campuses 
and ghettos that swept to its 
peak in the l903-1970 period. 
"We still haven't solved 
the Capitol bombing or the 
Pentagon washroom bomb-
ing,'' admitted one retired 
senior bureau official loyal 
to Hoover. "We've still got 
fugitives from the Weather-
men and SDS even though 
they've been on the 'Ten 
Most Wanted' list. We did a 
great jot, on the Communist. 
Party and the Klan. This 
was different." 
Yet even those concerns 
maS? have been outdistanced 
by events. The colleges and 
ghettos have quieted down. 
So have the styles of politi-
cal protest.

When asked about the

Helms told the Senate

that was a clear violation, 
of what our charter was.", 
The question was raised 
when the committee con- '

? Yet last week, in the se-. 
.cret White House doc-
uments published by the.:4 
'New York Times, domes--
tic' security aide Huston, 
'outlining his work on the 
White House domestic in-' 
telligence unit, said "I

fearful that the CIA would 
refuse to cooperate. In' . 
'fact, Dick Helms was most 
;cooperative and helpful, 
and the only stumbling 
.block was ,Mr. (J. Edgar), 
Hoover." 
Development of a secret

said, amounts to the coun-

which he partly blames on,

Oversight of the CIA has 
11een made especially diffi-

isponsibility. 
Over the years, commu-

T1 Functions of The CIA 
/ Disclosures about Central Intelligence 
Atency involvement in domestic espionage 
have given rise to a call for curtailment of CIA 
functions. It is being proposed that thC spy 
agency's operating functions be turned over 
to State Department and military personnel, 
confining the CIA to the task of evaluating 
and coordinating intelligence. 
This proposal derives weight from the 
fact that one of those advancing the idea is 
Morton H. Halperin, a former adviser to the 
National Security Council. He and Jeremy J. 
Stone of the Federation of American Scientists 
joined in making the proposal at a New York 
. University conference on governmental 
secrecy. 
Their recommendations appear to focus 
mainly on the role of the Central Intelligence 
Agency abroad. 'The time has come," they 
argue, "for America to change its strategy 
from covert intervention to setting a standard 
on non-intervention." They rightly note that 
whenever an instance of CIA manipulation of 
affairs abroad becomes. known?and this has 
frequently happened?harm is done Ameri-
ca's reputation and credibility. 
Halperin and Stone also are concerned 
about the intrusion of the CIA, into domestic 
affairs, both directly and to some extent in-
directly through the use of CIA-trained per-
sonnel. "The greatest presidential scandal of 
modern times," they say in their paper, "has 
arisen from the injection of covert methods, 
used by CIA graduates, into American so-
ciety." 
Just what changes should be made re-
mains debatable. Certainly action should not 
be hasty, but ought to be taken on the basis 
of a thoroughgoing review of past CIA activi-
ties and a searching consideration of what?its 
future role should be. But in our judgment 
Congress could do well to adopt as a working 
principle that the policy-making function of 
the Central Intelligence Agency should he 
eliminated or at very least strictly defined 
am! limited. In addition, steps should he 
taken to force the CIA not to depart in any 
, way from the legal structure on involvement 
kin domestic affairs.

The trouble with the truth 
The Politics 
Of Lying 
Government by Deception, 
Secrecy and Power. 
By David Wise. 
915 pp. New York: 
Random House. $8.95. 
By RICHARD HOLBROOKE 
Multiple Choice Question for 
the 1970's: The Government of 
the United States lies: (a) never; 
(b) only when it has to for 
reasons of national security; (c) 
whenever it feels like it, wheth-
er or not it affects national se-
curity; (d) whenever it feels like 
it,, to protect itself from domes-
tic political embarrassment; (e) 
most of the time; (f) all Of the 
time. ? 
By now, many Americans 
would pick- one of the last 
two choices to the question 
posed above. Turned off by 
Vietnam and Watergate and 
two Presidents in a row who 
have had low credibility ratings 
(for good reason), disillusioned 
by recent revelations of decep-
tion and even during the excit-
ing 1,000 days of the Kennedy 
Administration, many educated 
people see deceit even where 
there is none, and trickery be-
'hind even routine announce-
ments. Like the Boy Who Cried 
Wolf, the Government often has 
trouble being believed when it 
Is telling the truth. (Try Con-
vincing people, for example, 
that the Peace Corps is com-
pletely clean of any C.I.A. in-
volvement, as I firmly believe it 
is; even Peace Corps staff and 
volunteers sometimes doubt it, 
although three Presidents have 
issued orders to this effect, and 
no evidence has ever emerged. 
to the contrary.) 
It was not always thus. As 
recently as 1960, when the 
United States announced that 
it had lost a "weather research 
plane" near the Turkish bor-
der, most Americans accepted 
the official State Department 
explanation?until, confronted 
by a C.I.A. pilot alive and well 
in Soviet hands, President Ei-
senhower admitted the decep-
tion and accepted personal re-
sponsibility for the U-2 spy 
flights. 
Did the President of the Unit-
ed States lie? And, especially, 
Dwight D. Eisenhower? Ike real-
ized the cost of the lie, appar-
ently, for in retirement he said 
that "the lie we told about the 
U-2" wag his "greatest regret." 
Thirteen years after the U-2 
was shot down, the trust the 
United States Government once 
had has been seriously eroded. 
(Who would believe that cover 
story today?) Disbelief and 
cynicism are widespread. And 
it is not unusual to hear some 
of the more cynical among us 
argue that lying and deception 
are ncithing to .get upset about. 
After all, as I was told recently 
while debating some under-
graduates who were seven years 
old at the time of the U-2 inci-
dent and who view their Govern-
ment with appalling cynicism, 
"Everybody in the Government 
lies, so -why get excited?" 
Astounding, that one should 
even have to defend the propo-
sition that our Government 
should not lie to us. Yet it has 
become' necessary to make the 
case. Anthony Lake, who re-
Signed as Henery .Kissinger's 
assistant after the -1970 Cam-
bodian "incursion" *(and who 
recently learned that, while 
Working for Kissinger, he was 
having his home telephone 
tapped for "national security 
reasons") has written: "The es-
sential first step is for the Gov-
ernment to realize that it can-
not lead the public .whild mis-
leading it." 
"The Politics of Lying" is 
thus a title and theme of great 
promise. Major national issues 
transcending partisan politics 
are at stake. The Government 
is using its power to classify 
material, as David Wise ?tor-
rectly puts it, in order "tb de-
prive the American people of 
vital information." The system 
that has grown up, he adds, 
"has played a significant role 
in the general expansion of 
Presidential power" since World 
War II, and he conclude that 
"the Government's capacity to 
distort information in order to 
preserve its own political 
Power is almost limitless." 
Unfortunately, Mr. Wise's 
book is not equal to the am-
bitious task he has set out to 
accomplish. It never lives tip to 
the promise of its title. Anec-
dote follows anecdote to shock 
or amuse the reader; but they 
do not form a coherent picture 
of why and when the Govern-
ment chooses to lie; what it 
gains or loses by lying; and 
when and why the Hart get 
away with it. The complex 
reasons that lead official' tito 
public deception are not ex-
plored here. 
The extraordinary irony of 
the way in which public lying 
creates self-deception within 
the executive branch (and the 
great costs of such self-decep-
tion) is overlooked entirely. 
Instead, one finds a collection 
Of 'stories, some old, some new, 
some borrowed all designed 
to convince the readtr of what 
Wise himself says the reader, 
already knows: the Government, 
lies a lot. We want more than! 
The whys and hows of lying,. 
as well as its 'real costs, are 
only glimpsed through the 'un-
even aneedotage of ? this book. 
As for solutions, we can all 
agree with Mr. Wise that "the 
only 'solution' to 'Government 
lying is to tell the truth," but 
.his recommendations are both 
brief and unrealistic. (To sug-
gest, fir example, that all 
classified documents should be-
come public after three years 
unless the President personally 
keeps them classified is simply 
not workable.) 
Too much of "The Politics of 
Lying" is devoted to a compen-
dium Of essentially minor com-
plaints about the treatment of 
the press by the' White House. 
It is a shame, because Mr. Wise 
is addressing one of the major 
problems of our times, one that 
is far deeper than the "credibil-
ity gap." There seems little 
.likelihood of it diminishing, 
eitlitr, despite the hopeful state-
ment with which the Presi-
dent's Communications Direc-
tor, Herb Klein, ushered in the 
Age of Nixon in November, 
INS: "Truth will be the hall-
mark of the Nixon Administra-
tion. . . . We feel that we will 
be able to eliminate any possi-
bility of a credibility gap in this 
Administration." 
Credibility gap. The very 
phrase,, V.,hich entered our vo-
cabulary only a few years ago, 
both identifies a colossal prob-
lem for every administration, 
and obscures the even more 
important question of why 
Presidents, other . politicians, 
and bureaucrats lie. Take Water-
gate, for example?a classic 
and staggering case of lying, 
apparently at every level of the 
Government. But why? Mr. 
Wise's book (which ? was fin-
ished before the more recent 
spectacular events) does not 
provide us with many clues. 
But in the Watergate tragedy, 
lying must be viewed as the 
public front edge of a much 
larger failure?.a failure on the 
part of our leaders to believe 
in, and live by, the democratic 
principles on which our nation 
is supposedly based. 
The evidence relentlessly 
emerging supports this gloomy 
assessment; our leaders lied 
publicly because they were act-
ing in an anti-democratic man-
ner privately. In the brilliant 
perception of columnist Stewart 
Alsop, ? they were using the 
techniques of war, not politics. 
And when their private (and 
illegal) action began to emerge 
they had no recourse 'but to 
lie as a defense. 
The credibility gap, then, 
? may. be viewed in a somewhat 
different way. The Government 
this, but it is not here.

Arab edigor comments on Nixon, Brezhnev: 
gate *ts effectiveness in 
By John K. Cooley 
Staff correspondent of 
The Christian Science Monitor 
Beirut, Lebanon 
A leading Arab commentator says 
that Watergate and Soviet policy have 
, made it impossible for President 
Nixon and Soviet Communist Party 
leader Leonid I. Brezhnev to deal 
effectively with the Middle East 
crisis. 
Muhammad Haykal, chief editor of 
the Cairo Daily Ai-Ahmm, bitterly 
criticized the Soviet Union in a com-
mentary published June 22. He ac-
cused Moscow of cutting its' aid to the 
Arabs in half, while the U.S. doubled 
its own help to Israel. 
Though its terms are more dra-
matic than most other Arab reactions 
to the Nixon-Brezhnev, summit, Mr. 
Haykal's article reflects the growing 
Arab disenchantment with Moscow. 
? Ealier a Kuwait newspaper, Al-
Siyassa, expressed this by caning on 
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab 
oil states to cut down their depen-
dence on both the U.S. and the 
Soviet Union for aid and oil markets, 
and take the solution of the conflict 
with Israel into their own hands. 
A Lebanese writer, Clovis Mak-
soud, reported from Washington in 
the Beirut newspaper Al-Nahar that 
Zionist quarters in the United States 
were conducting a powerful cam-
paign to "submerge" the Nixon-
Brezhnev summit in the issue of 
Soviet Jewish emigration to Israel. ' 
In his article, Mr. Haykal said 
, Watergate had reduced the ability of 
'the White House to deal with the 
Mideast by strengthening the hand of 
the U.S. Congress, where Watergate 
had left Israel's supporters even 
stronger than before. 
This may have ended all plans for a 
Mideast policymaking role by Henry 
Kissinger who even before Watergate 
had been reluctant to attack the 
Mideast issue, Mr. Haykal added. 
Kissinger described 
(In an article in the lastest issue of 
the Beirut quarterly magazine, Jour-
nal of Palestine Studies, U.S. political 
scientist and Mideast expert Malcolm 
Kerr writes that "Kissinger has 
shown no great interest in Middle 
Eastern problems in the past." 
(". . . even if Nixon as a second-
term President cared nothingJor his 
party's loss of electoral favor, the 
heat and anger of public debate that a 
get-tough policy toward Israel would 
surely generate and the prospect of 
revolt from a Democratic Congress 
. . are bound to make him wonder 
whether he could even control, let 
alone justify, a controversial Middle 
East policy, "Dr. Kerr writes. 
("What would he plan to do if 
Congress suddenly seized the in-
itiative over his veto and voted for 
new arms shipments to Israel, accom-
. panied by a resolution endorsing her 
bargaining position?" Dr. Kerr asks.) 
Soviet position 'neutralized' 
Mr. Haykal contends in his article 
east 
that while the United States knows 
what it wants in the Middle East, the 
Soviet Union does not. 
Israel, he says, has "neutralized" 
' the Soviet position in the Mideast. If 
U.S. support to Israel in the past was 
"100 percent, it is now 200 percent," 
Mille if Soviet backing for the Arabs 
"was only 50 percent in the past, at 
present it is 25 percent." 
What Moscow does not want, Mr. 
Haykal says, is another Arab defeat 
that would destroy residual Soviet 
prestige in the Mideast. Moscow fears 
to use its strength to change the power 
balance, since it might dislike the 
results and come into confrontation 
with the United States. 
Finally, says Mr. Haykal, the 
U.S.S.R. does not want an "American 
solution," Mr. Haykal sees American 
strategy as aiming at keeping the 
cease-fire and Israeli military superi-
ority; halting efforts inside and out-
side the UN for a real settlement; and 
draining Egypt's strength and isolat-
ing her. 
Further, writes Mr. Haykal, Wash-
ington concentrates on the Persian 
Gulf area, which Mr. Haykal calls 
"the potential focus of war;" deep-
ening Arab-Iranian tensions; wiping 
out "revolutionary centers;" telling 
the Arabs that Washington holds the 
key to the Mideast problem and 
offering pragmatic solutions "which 
are really a way of keeping the 
Mideast situation as it is, rather than 
changing it."

VOCE REPUBBLICANA, Rome 
2-3 May1973 
WATERGATE AND US 
THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY 
Frankly, it seems to us that even now, when the "Watergate 
Case" concerning wiretapping in America has fully exploded, even 
now when the eyes of the entire world are fixed on this new, ' 
dramati crack in American society, when the temptation to make 
comparisons with what is going on in our own house is quite legitimate, 
very few here in Italy have fully understood the profound but evident 
meaning and lesson that is being imparted to us by this event. 
By this it is meant that very few have had the courage--not to mention 
decency--to admit that the difference between the United States and 
us is this: on the one hand there is a country that is struggling 
for the defense, or rather the strengthening of democracy and, on 
the other hand, the country is a quagmire in which democracy is 
suffocating. And the lack of awareness of this unbridgeable 
difference constitutes an element--burcertainly not the only element--
of the botched democracy that we see around us whose manifestation 
every day and in every domain we can only note and lament. 
The most widespread sentiment which we hear expressed in all 
political and public opinion sectors is, in broad terms, as follows: 
political structures in America are creaking, and the !Watergate Case" 
is a clear demonstration that there is no true democracy; with us, 
however, things are even worse: scandals of this type, when they 
do not abort, die at birth. Political corruption in the United States 
exists, but it just so happens that it is denounced, even if the 
"system" remains what it is; with us, corruption is just as widespread 
(if not more so) but, as soon as it comes to light, it is enmeshed in 
such a tangle of competing interests as to be suffocated immediately, 
with the result that no one even has the satisfaction or learnjng the 
details. In other words, between the two failures of true democracy, 
ours is worse. From this derives, if one can so express it, a 
quantitative difference of non-qualitative democracy--or lack of 
democracy. 
Whoever says this, either in good faith or bad, has not, so 
far as we can see, grasped the true connection between what is 
happening in the U.S. and what we are witnessing in Italy. Democracy 
is not something that exists in the abstract and, where it does 
exist, does not need continuous examination, continuous checking. 
The democratic system is not for those who once they have obtained 
it need no longer think about it--that holds, for example, for 
dictatorships; precisely because its structure is "open" to all 
components, the good and the bad, democracy requires the constant 
surveillance of the society of which it is the expression. Democracy 
is always imperfect, is always a tormented dialectic game, is always 
running risks of involution. For this reason, Churchill's phrase is 
valid, that it is a bad system but that the others are worse. But, 
if its principal 'danger is that of being corrupted, its principal virtue 
is that of knowing how to-correct itself.

All this is so evident that the type of uninformed regurgitation 
underlying almost all Italian conunents on these events on the other 
side of the Atlantic seems incredible--the idea, in short, that if 
things are not going well in our country, they are not going much 
better in America. The truth is quite otherwise. At issue is not 
corruption, which is a human activity in every political system and . 
in every latitude. What is to be judged is the manner of fighting it. 
And here the difference between the U.S. and Italy is unbridgeable. 
Is it necessary to repeat that the American system is not only the 
Administration, is not only the White House, but is rather that 
particular combination of constitutional guarantees, that particular 
system pf political checks and balances, that type of control and of 
public opinion participation. The 'Watergate Case," after Vietnam, 
after Johnson, after the Pentagon Papers, is the umpteenth confirmation 
of it. What, if not "the system," has led to the dismantling of 
almost the entire White House general .staff, to the removal of those . 
whom public opinion had identified as being primarily responsible for 
the scandal, and to the insertion of others, like Richardson, 
considered "liberal"? Whence, if not out of the system, came the 
courage and energy to correct the system? 
Let us repeat, to consider that American society is now 
politically healthy would be to close one's eyes to reality: the 
scandal has revealed a profound rot reaching to Washington's 
political summits. But let us recognize that we are dealing with 
a democracy capable of defending and correcting itself with pitiless 
determination and rigor, without fear of the "eyes of the world." 
This is precisely the unique lessOn that we can draw from the event. 
It would be a salutary lesson, if it were heard. But given the 
conunents it has elicited in Italy, the American scandal does not 
induce many hopes. Commentators have harped on the scandalous aspects--
sacrosanct, certainly--and have underrated the gigantic effort that 
American society has exerted, and is exerting, to emerge from them 
with justice. Of such a collective effort in Italy, one sees not even 
a trace as regards our own affairs. Energies here are dedicated to 
party interests, to personal benefits, to shady relationships of currents. 
One navigates among scandals, still unborn or born maimed and then 
asphyxiated. There is, in all strata, a sense of suffocation and 
strangulation of true democracy, which has few positive turns. One 
notes the spread of a fragmented, obscure, corporatized, uncontrolled 
power, which is born and dies in the darkness of corridors and under-
the-table negotiations. A democracy without checks and balances is 
not a democracy; it has neither the chance nor the capacity to correct 
itself that is indispensable for keeping itself vital. This is the 
lesson of the "Watergate Case": whoever draws other lessons from it 
has not understood the always more dramatic problems of our democracy 
or has understood them and'sPeaks only for the sake of convenience.

WASHINGTON POST PARADE 
17' June 1973 
A SPECIAL JACK ANDERSON REPORT  
WASHINGTON, D.C. , 
resident Nixon will know enough . 
[ 
iaabout Leonid Brezhnev zo write a 
biography when the two leaders fi-
nally sit down together at the sum-
mit. Brezhnev's health? The President 
, will have a complete medical report. 
Brezhnev's temperament? A detailed 
psychological profile will be available. 
' Brezhnev's beliefs? The President will 
have transcripts of private Kremlin 
. conversations. 
Intimate information 
Nixon even has the name of Brezh-
nev's favorite masseuse. In the privacy 
of the Kremlin, Brezhnev confided to 
_Soviet President Nikolai Podgorny that 
he was looking forward to a rubdown 
from a masseuse named Olga. Ameri-
can spies were listening when Pod-
gorny answered, with a knowing 
chuckle: "Oh, ho! Olga!" 
In the rarefied atmosphere of inter-
? national power politics, such intimate 
inform' aiion can be a powerful bargain-
ing chip. Thick dossiers on world 
leaders are compiled by the Central 
Intelligence Agency, which gathers its 
information by every method, from 
electronic eavesdropping to routine 
research. 
The secret profile of Leonid Brezh-
nev, according to those who have seen 
it, portrays him as an amiable, robust, 
hard-drinking outdoorsman. He likes to 
gossip about his colleagues in the 
Kremlin, and he engages in the con-
stant bickering and backbiting that goes 
on behind those Byzantine walls. His 
private conversations are heavily laced 
with locker-room language. He likes to 
relax at a place Soviet leaders call the 
"Clinic" near the Kremlin. This is the 
Soviet equivalent of a private health 
Club. 
' The profile also contains incidents 
and insights from CIA intelligence re-
ports. During the 1968 Czechoslovakian 
crisis, for example, the man Brezhnev 
ousted as Premier, Nikita Khrushchev, 
suddenly showed up at theARPAWIAF 
demanded to see his successor. Khrush-
they loudly warned that the Czech in-
vasion could turn into a disaster unless 
Soviet troops were pulled out at once. 
Brezhnev gruffly refused to see Khrush= 
chev and ignored his advice. 
A profile of Castro 
The profile on Fidel Castro contains a 
CIA report that the Kremlin has asked 
the Cuban dictator "to try to regain 
control over Latin American revolution-
ary movements" and has promised to 
"pay all the costs involved." 
The CIA also reported Castro's pri-
vate opinion of the Marxist regime in 
Chile and its leader, President Salvador 
Allende. Castro correctly predicted a 
year in advance "a breakdown in pub-
lic order." This, he said, could come 
about at any time because the opposi-
tion, especially the middle class, had 
lost its fear of government. Castro 
opined that a government must have 
fear if it is to control the country. 
"Another factor listed by Castro," 
continued the secret CIA report, "was 
the possible deterioration of Allende's 
health. Castro said he is worried about 
Allende because the latter is physically 
'spent.' Castro also observed that [Chil-
ean) leaders live too Well and are not 
undir sufficient tension to take the 
offensive." 
The CIA not only keeps Communist 
leaders under scrutiny; it also checks on 
friendly leaders. The financial difficul-
ties of Costa Rica's respected President 
Jose Figueres, for example, were quietly 
relayed to Washington. The CIA quoted 
a family member as complaining that 
"all the members of the President's 
family are deeply concerned with fam-
ily financial matters:' 
The CIA also gleefully reported 
an awkward confrontation between 
France's President Georges Pompidou 
and West Germany's Chancellor Willy 
Branch a few months ago. "A heated 
exchange took place after the Brandt-
Pompidou dinner," said the CIA. A 
German economics official, "told Pom-
? pidou that France was profiting from 
and encouraging the inflation afflicting 
other European countries . . . Accord-
ing to members of Brandt's party, 
Brandt stood by and visibly enjoyed 
Pompidou's discomfiture. Schoel lborn. 
supported his accusations with details 
which Pompidou was unable to refute." 
The world's two most celebrated ? 
women leaders, Israel's Golda Meir and ? 
India's Indira Gandhi, are reported by 
the CIA to have a long-distance feud 
brewing. According to the CIA account, 
. Mrs. Meir regards Mrs. Gandhi as "neu-
tral ... on the side of Egypt," while Mrs. 
Gandhi sees Israel as a "warmonger." 
The dossiers on Arab leaders are.: 
loaded with CIA tidbits. Egypt's Presi- ? ? 
dent Anwar Sadat,' "when threatening . 
Israel with an all-out war, was bluffing," ? 
reported the CIA. Jordan's King Hussein' 
threatened "to go on a ghazou" unless ? 
he received more American aid. A gha- . 
zou, it was explained, "is a Bedouin 
, raid against neighbors for the purpose 
, of looting." Syria's President Hafez-al-
Assad was portrayed by the CIA as an ? 
outspoken militant who doesn't "expect 
? too much from Egyptians." Assad uses 
the Arabic word "Iamma" when he 
speaks of war with Israel. "Lamma" 
means "when" not "if," explained a 
CIA report. 
Spying on foreign leaders is a routine 
operation, involving CIA agents in the 
field and researchers at headquarters. 
Reports from diplomats and military at-
tach?also go into the dossiers. If Wash-
ington suddenly wants more informa-
tion about a certain dignitary, say in 
advance of a summit meeting, he be-
comes "targeted." Then the full re-
sources of the clandestine agency are 
trained upon laying his life bare. 
The first step in the daily spying 
process is known as the "library 
search." Researchers routinely clip 
newspaper and magazine articles about 
foreign notables and send them into the 
'CIA's "Biographic Registry" computer. 
As part of the "library search," field 
agents are asked to fill out forms on 
foreign leaders, which resemble job 
applications. To the extent possible, 
relatives, friends and acquaintances are 
casually contacted. Information is gath-
ered helter-skelter, with rumor and fact' 
carefully noted. It is left to the experts 
in Washington to assemble the jigsaw 
pieces and make the final distinctions. 
Nothing taken for granted 
Even the most rudimentary facts, 
however, are not taken for granted. "In 
many foreign societies, the leaders 
mask their backgrounds as much as pos-
sible," a CIA man told us. "It's not like 
in the 'United States where you have 
everything from FBI files to job applica-
alttictivemo.p_7sonal history."

tion can be picked up quite legitimately ' 
by America's observers overseas. For 
,example, a military attache in Moscow 
became great friends with the Soviet 
Defense Minister during the Khrush-
chev years. While the stuffy Soviet big-
wigs would shuffle about at official re-
ceptions, the attache and minister 
would toss down vodka and swap sto-
ries about their superiors. 
Of course, electronic eavesdropping 
is often used. In Belgium .a CIA opera-
tive learned that the Chinese Com-
munist embassy was planning to move. 
He quickly located the new site and 
rented the house next door. Bugs were 
placed in the new embassy before the 
Chinese moved in. The CIA 'picked up 
an earful before the bugs were eventu-
ally discovered. 
While the field operatives are poking 
;into every dark corner of the subject's 
life, academics back at the CIA com-
pile anthropological and sociological 
data on the arra in which the subject 
grew up. This is done in the CIA's 
"Geographic Office." The structure of 
the society, its mores and customs, are 
depicted. Even the type of diet adds to 
the portrait of the person. 
The "Geographic Office" report on 
-Mao Tse-tung, for instance, noted that 
he traveled as a beggar through the 
country in his youth, seeing firsthand 
the poverty and corruption. This 'pro-
Joundly affected the young Mao and 
helped ignite the revolutionary fire that 
caused him to help fOund the Chinese 
Communist Party in the early 1920's. 
Today, intelligence reports confirm that 
Mao is still the purest of revolutionaries. 
. Medical diagnosis 
The CIA also directs its agents to 
dredge up all possible medical informa-
tion for the medical researchers to diag-
nose. Once, agents tapped into wash-
room pipes in one of Monte Carlo's 
most glamorous casinos to get a urine 
sample from the oil-rich King of Saudi 
Arabia, who was rumored to be ailing. 
Inside the washroom, crouched behind 
a commode door, an agent waited with 
an electronic signaling device. The King, 
a heavy drinker and addicted gambler, 
finally entered in a swirl of white robe. 
The agent alerted his colleague in the 
plumbing closet, and the nbzzle was 
turned on the pipe tapped into the 
washroom plumbing. 
But the greatest coup in the annals 
of. the CIA's medical espionage oc-
curred during Nikita Khrushchey's state 
visit to the United States in 1959. CIA 
men managed to iSolate and bore tri-
umphantly to the labs. the Soviet lead-
er's solid waste for medical analysis. 
Sophisticated photographic tech-
niques arealso used to observe leaders 
at long distance. Called "targets .of op-
portunity" in CIA jargon, the photos are 
compared with old Ones for signs of 
stress, aging and disease. A blotchy skin, 
38 
for example, can indicate a liver prob-. 
lem. 
Through long-range observation, the 
CIA learned of the late Egyptian Presi-
dent Nasser's heart condition and of the 
late Indonesian President Sukarno'S vis-
its to a Viennese specialist. (Surveillance 
of Sukarno, incidentallY, revealed he 
liked his hosts to have a woman for him 
on state visits.) 
Photographic evidence 
Long-range photography settled a 
rumor, back before the Chinese-Ameni-s* 
can detente, whether Mao Tse-tung was 
sick and using a double for public ap-
pearances. A photograph was taken 
Mao in public. By measuring the length 
of the earlobe and by determining that ' 
his facial wart was in exactly the right 
place, the agency certified him as genu-
ine. Then by closely examining the pic-
ture, CIA analysts learned that the aging 
leader was not critically ill as had been 
rumored: 
For all the sophisticated methods the 
CIA uses to gather intelligence on 
world leaders, however, nothing is 
quite .as revealing as a face-to-face 
meeting. More can be learned from one 
tough negOtiating session than from a 
10,000-page report prepared by the 
CIA. For it's not the juicy tidbits So 
much as the basic attitudes that matter 
in the world of power politics.
