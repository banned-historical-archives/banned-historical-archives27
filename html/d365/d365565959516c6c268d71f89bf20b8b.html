 The Policy Views of
 China's Hu Yaobang
 From Out of Deng's Shadow:
 significance.
 Hu Yaobang, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, is
 China's most controversial leader, though by no means its most powerful.
 Outspoken, impulsive, aggressive, he has aroused opposition among the
 party's elders-civilian and military alike-both for his unconventional
 personal style and for his policy views. Although regarded since 1980 as
 Deng Xiaoping's chosen successor for political leadership of the party, a
 combination of objections to Hu's leadership and dissatisfaction with
 reforms he has advocated appears to have dampened his prospects of
 stepping directly into Deng's leading role on the Politburo. Nevertheless,
 Hu will remain a key figure in Chinese politics for the next several years,
 and his views on issues confronting the leadership will be of major
 Hu is indeed a complex and contradictory figure:
 ? He is strongly identified with political reform and the movement to
 rejuvenate the party with younger, more capable technocrats.
 ? He is not an orthodox Marxist in the economic sphere and clearly sees
 radical reform as necessary to solve China's massive economic problems
 and to win popular support for a party badly tarnished by a residual
 "leftist" image, corruption, and poor bureaucractic performance. Hu
 seems particularly concerned that China not follow the Polish example.
 ? Hu is the leader most identified with promoting "liberal" trends in
 China, ranging from encouraging peasants to "get rich" to loosening
 restrictions on literary expression to wearing Western-style clothing.
 ? He is, nonetheless, a staunch proponent of party controls on many aspects
 of social and political life and takes strikingly dogmatic positions on
 questions involving socialist morality and the need for ideological
 education.
 interviews with foreign journalists.
 ? Although usually portrayed as obsessed with facts and details, Hu
 sometimes betrays only a rudimentary understanding of important
 foreign and domestic policies and often makes "misstatements" in

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/06/22 : CIA-RDP04T00447R000200900001-3
 On questions of foreign policy, Hu's views seem somewhat at odds with
 those expressed by Deng and other senior reform leaders, and his tendency
 to state them bluntly sharpens the sense that they are controversial:
 ? Hu appears less favorably disposed toward closer relations with the
 United States and frequently disparages US policies, leaders, and social
 trends.
 ? He seems to take a consistently hard line on the Taiwan question, and
 particularly on the role of the United States as Taiwan's protector.
 ? Since he is a visceral nationalist conditioned by 50 years of Communist
 activism, Hu's foreign policy framework seems more narrowly ideological
 than Deng's, and he appears genuinely to favor equidistance in China's
 relations with the United States and the Soviet Union.
 ? Hu may have fewer reservations about developing closer relations with
 Moscow.
 China's leadership picture is clouded by uncertainty as the party moves
 toward a major Central Committee conclave in September, at which
 personnel issues, including succession questions, will be addressed. Rumors
 abound that the 70-year-old Hu may accede to Deng's position as
 Chairman of the party's Military Commission, but that he will shortly be
 replaced as General Secretary by his younger (56) protege, Hu Qili. At this
 point, we do not know how these modified succession arrangements will
 sort themselves out or what effect they will have on China's foreign and do-
 mestic policies. Hu Yaobang continues to talk tough and act confidently,
 and the reform programs he has pushed hardest are being implemented
 steadily. He remains a formidable political figure.
 In a post-Deng leadership in which Hu would play an important role, we
 would expect relative continuity with most of Deng's policies:
 ? Organizational reform will continue, but perhaps more slowly, because of
 the lack of Deng's mediating influence.
 ? Economic reform will proceed, but its pace and scope may be altered by
 the persistence of practical problems and by the cast of a post-Deng
 leadership, which probably will be more cautious and conservative. The
 "open-door" approach to trade with the West and promotion of market-
 style macroeconomic policies probably will be maintained.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/06/22 : CIA-RDP04T00447R000200900001-3
 ? Hu might be inclined to take a tougher position regarding the United
 States in general, and his propensity to speak first and ask questions later
 might complicate bilateral relations. Hu might, for example, be less
 skilled than Deng has been at keeping troublesome issues such as textile
 disagreements from adversely affecting larger interests. Nonetheless, the
 importance of the US connection for China's economic development will
 provide a firm foundation for the relationship.
 ? Hu may be more amenable to overtures from Moscow to improve
 relations, but China would maintain its "independent and antihegemon-
 ist" perspective. Hu is not pro-Soviet, but his tone, style, and what we
 view as his relatively narrow perspective suggest that he, unlike Deng,
 may steer China toward a truly independent foreign policy. Cooperation
 with the Soviet Union against US interests in our view would be unlikely.

 Secret
 From Out of Deng's Shadow:
 The Policy Views of
 China's Hu Yaobang
 Hu Yaobang is an unconventional Chinese leader. In
 sharp contrast to his colleagues on the Chinese Com-
 munist Party's ruling Politburo, Hu eschews a dour,
 reserved style in favor of a more animated, outspoken
 approach. In command of a party filled with aloof,
 privileged high officials, Hu-rough, bluff, and self-
 educated-projects a genuine man-of-the-people im-
 age. Although most of China's top leaders envelop
 even routine political matters in obsessive secrecy, Hu
 impulsively expresses himself to Chinese and foreign-
 ers alike with remarkable candor and may then joke
 about having divulged "top secret" material. When
 seized with an idea, he may spontaneously run it out
 to a point beyond either the party's official position or
 his own previously expressed views. This pattern of
 Hu's behavior has aroused considerable anger among
 the party old guard.
 Any attempt to take Hu's measure as a man and
 leader is complicated by his cluttered public record.
 We view him, as do many Chinese, as a bundle of
 contradictions. Widely seen as a staunch reformer,
 Hu nevertheless is capable of issuing starkly orthodox
 ideological injunctions. He is often characterized in
 the press                       as a man "on
 top of things" and obsessed with facts and details, but
 sometimes Hu betrays only a rudimentary under-
 standing of important foreign and domestic policies.
 Although he leads a party that prizes its image of
 unity and collective decisionmaking, Hu impulsively
 oversteps the boundaries that usually restrict leaders
 from speaking their minds.
 As General Secretary, Hu exercises greater day-to-
 day influence over the lives of the Chinese people than
 any other leader. One of the six members of the
 Politburo Standing Committee, Hu plays a key role in
 deliberating the broad guidelines for all party and
 state policy. He operates from a formidable base
 within the party, having installed a network of rela-
 tively youthful supporters in key positions throughout
 the apparatus. As the political heir of China's para-
 mount leader, Deng Xiaoping, Hu has crisscrossed the
 country selling Deng's policies, risked the political fire
 Hu Yaobang, General Secre-
 tary of the Communist Party of
 of Deng's opponents by taking advanced positions on
 reform, and has been a principal mover and shaker on
 questions such as organizational reform and policy
 toward intellectuals. After Deng, Hu is the party's
 chief ideological spokesman.
 In his public behavior, Hu seems aggressively confi-
 dent of his place as party leader, but a growing body
 of recent evidence indicates that the 70-year-old Hu,
 beset by controversy and opposition during his tenure
 as General Secretary, will soon surrender the post to
 his younger protege, Hu Qili.
 Hu will then succeed Deng as chairman of
 the party's Military Commission. We have long ex-
 pected that Hu would eventually head the commis-
 sion, but losing his post as General Secretary would
 diminish the significance of the appointment. As a
 member of the Politburo Standing Committee, how-
 ever, Hu probably will remain one of China's key
 decisionmakers in the post-Deng era. Moreover, once
 Deng departs, Hu may yet become, as Deng now is,
 the weight that tips the scales in deliberations, a force
 for policy continuity or policy reversal. Political condi-
 tions altered by Deng's death, including the distribu-
 tion of power in the leadership, may generate pressure
 for change in domestic and foreign policy, and Hu's
 views will be crucial in any post-Deng reassessment.

 Political Superiors
 Hu's policy preferences and political strategies are
 directly shaped by those of Deng Xiaoping and, to a
 lesser extent, other senior leaders. In a speech follow-
 ing his elevation to party Chairman at the June 1981
 Central Committee plenum, Hu deferred to the lead-
 ing role of party elders Ye Jianying, Li Xiannian,
 Chen Yun, and especially Deng Xiaoping, whom he
 referred to as China's "primary decisionmaker.'~
 As Hu has warmed to his role as party leader,
 however, he has shown more and more impatience
 with the accumulated wisdom of the elders and
 greater willingness to strike out on his own. In a
 recent interview, for example, he disputed Deng's
 contention that China is capable of imposing a block-
 ade on Taiwan. In late 1984, Hu told foreign journal-
 ists that China's gerontocratic leadership had a "se-
 nility problem."
 Young Confidants
 Hu's coterie of former Communist Youth League
 (CYL) associates is well known.' Foremost among
 these is his apparent successor, Hu Qili, permanent
 secretary of the Secretariat and the man to whom Hu
 delegates much of the daily work of running the party.
 Hu Qili is constantly at his mentor's side at press
 interviews, on domestic inspection tours, and on visits
 abroad. Given the lean personal staffs of China's
 leaders, Hu Qili seems to serve the General Secretary
 much like a chief of staff-as executor, idea man, and
 "lightning rod."
 Over the past two years, Hu has pulled several other
 young associates up from relative obscurity. Secretari-
 at alternates Qiao Shi and Hao Jianxiu and party
 department chiefs Wang Zhaoguo and Qian Liren are
 frequent companions of Hu. Qiao, Wang, and Qian-
 handling personnel, administrative affairs, and inter-
 national party-to-party ties, respectively-are key
 players in Hu's effort to consolidate his authority
 within the party bureaucracy, as well as sources of
 advice. Hao, a former textile worker, is the most
 prominent political woman of the coming generation.
 By showcasing younger, better educated leaders, Hu
 personally puts policy on display-promoting "third
 echelon" leaders is one of his frequent themes-while
 implicitly suggesting that the advice he receives is not
 warmed-over, 1950s-style Communist dogma.
 Family
 Like most Chinese leaders, Hu relies on his family to
 perform political tasks and provide counsel. His wife,
 Li Zhao, a retired textile ministry official, traveled to
 Hong Kong in the wake of the Sino-British accord,
 presumably to gather impressions and report to her
 husband. According to a diplomatic source, his son
 Hu Deping moves in intellectual circles and often
 funnels unconventional advice and theoretical view-
 points to his father. Another son, Hu Liu, is a chemist
 and vice president of a corporation set up to import
 Western technology.

 Secret
 Inspection Tours
 "Going deep into reality" for firsthand experience is a
 party rite, and no national figure goes deeper than
 Hu, China's most peripatetic leader. Hu frequently
 draws on personal observations from his tours to make
 a point or draw a conclusion in Beijing. Hu says he
 wants to visit all of China's provinces, and his widely
 reported travels implicitly contrast his personal vigor
 to the sedentary style of the party elders. Hu made 13
 trips during 1984, visiting 14 provinces and 102
 counties and cities. Reports of Hu on site have him
 peppering local officials, workers, and peasants with
 sharp questions that, at the hands of the propagan-
 dists, invariably demonstrate his familiarity with the
 local situation. Since the plenum, Hu has especially
 sought to meet, and focus national attention on,
 innovative peasants who have cashed in on the
 reforms.
 Hu often acts as his own political troubleshooter, and,
 as such, is blunt and decisive.
 the West appears to be from books.
 Books
 Although he is basically a pragmatist, Hu appears to
 be well grounded in Marxist-Leninist classics and
 frequently cites the works of Marx, Lenin, Stalin, and
 Mao as acceptable guides to action. Hu also claims to
 have read a wide variety of materials from both
 Chinese and Western sources-history, political biog-
 raphy, and, among other things, former President
 Nixon's books (in private translation). Although he
 has traveled outside China, most of Hu's knowledge of
 Experience and Political Culture
 Hu's views bear the deep imprint of Chinese party
 institutions and history. He picked up organizational
 skills as a young party cadre during the war with
 Japan and in the subsequent Communist takeover of
 China and became imbued with the same nationalism
 that inspired the entire party leadership. Hu's Youth
 League experience, apart from providing a political
 base, fostered a reputed sensitivity to the impatience
 and ambitions of young Chinese and a sympathetic
 view of intellectuals.
 after quitting."
 For Hu and other Chinese officials, the Cultural
 Revolution is a watershed for formulation of current
 attitudes and policies. Much of what Deng and Hu
 have sought to accomplish entails reversing and ne-
 gating the radical politics of that era. Reflecting on
 the violence and social chaos of that period, Hu has
 said that the party "should never stir up another
 internal disorder that causes us to suffer failures and
 poverty." Hu is concerned that the "ultraleftist"
 practices that characterized the Cultural Revolution
 continue to act as an insidious force of habit among
 Chinese, as he put it, "like reaching for cigarettes

 It is difficult to distinguish clearly the policy prefer-
 ences of individual Chinese leaders. We receive few
 accounts of deliberations within the inner circle of
 leadership, and public statements, even in more spon-
 taneous forms such as press interviews, generally
 reflect collectively determined positions rather than
 the personal views of the speaker. Other analytic
 difficulties, such as differentiating between actual
 policy views and posturing for effect, are hardly
 unique to China.
 The relative importance of a leader within Beijing's
 political pecking order can often be determined by the
 bluntness of his speech. The right of relatively unre-
 stricted speech is enjoyed by only a handful of
 Chinese leaders, and it is the privilege of the most
 powerful to make policy on their feet and have others
 accommodate themselves to the pronouncement. Few
 leaders apart from Mao and Deng have been powerful
 enough to make a habit of outspokenness.
 Hu Yaobang, however, seems to have fewer reserva-
 tions than other Chinese leaders about speaking out.
 In our view, Hu's candor is partly the byproduct of a
 voluble nature and partly an effort to assert his
 leading role. We believe that Hu, like Deng, frequent-
 ly uses unvarnished language for tactical purposes to
 apply political pressure. Moreover, we view Hu's habit
 of speaking out as itself a policy preference, part of an
 effort to broaden the party's popular base and "demo-
 cratize" inner party discussions. Recent practices
 such as announcing national political conferences in
 advance, openly disclosing items on the political agen-
 da, and publishing lists of party and state appointees
 reflect Hu's belief that the party should partially raise
 the curtain of secrecy that traditionally has distanced
 the rulers from the ruled in China.
 Economic Reform
 For the economy, Hu, like Deng, favors policies that
 get results. He readily admits his general ignorance of
 economics, a deficiency he shares with most of the top
 leadership. Although he once seemed content to leave
 the economy to government administration, he has
 become more involved and insistent on questions of
 economic reform. He appears keenly attuned to the
 political imperatives that drive reform-especially the
 need for success
 Hu's public remarks on wage reform, an issue where
 economic and political considerations overlap, are a
 case in point. In a recent interview, Hu said he was
 disappointed that the timetable for wage reform had
 slipped from January to July 1985, and he hoped that
 the reform could be undertaken in April (it was not).
 Regarding individual incomes, Hu implicitly has criti-
 cized conservatives such as Chen Yun-who has
 argued that people should eat well, "but not too
 well"-by asserting that, when production has been
 developed, it is improper to require people to econo-
 mize on food and clothing and to restrict consump-
 tion.
 Although the leadership disagrees on the utility of
 establishing specific long-range goals that ultimately
 could prove embarrassing, Hu has been among those
 in the forefront calling for the quadrupling of China's
 economic output by the year 2000. The recent perfor-
 mance of the Chinese economy has led Hu to pro-
 claim confidently that the quadrupling goal was as-
 sured
 Hu has favored doctrinally unorthodox formulations
 in promoting economic reform. While on an inspec-
 tion tour in Sichuan, Hu told a gathering that "the
 party's criterion for assessing right or wrong (in
 economic reform) is to see whether a thing helps
 people get rich." Hu also told local leaders that
 exploration, adventure, and competition, although
 bourgeois ideas, are progressive and worth emulating.
 Almost alone among his Politburo colleagues, Hu
 frequently has allowed that changes in lifestyle can

 promote economic change (he has advocated wearing
 Western-style clothing and suggested that use of
 knives and forks is a more sanitary way of dining).
 "Even if reforms go a bit too far," he said late last
 year, "they must be protected and remedied."
 Organizational Reform
 In his own statements, Hu reflects the dilemma of a
 party in transition, seeking to shift the basis of its
 legitimacy away from doctrine and coercion toward
 practical demonstrations of its fitness to rule. Organi-
 zational reform is an essential part of this task. Hu, a
 member of the Communist Party for more than 50
 years, clearly shares concerns of veteran revolutionar-
 ies about corruption and "slackness" in the party. In
 speeches from 1979 to the present, Hu has addressed
 several key themes:
 ? Leadership: the party's vanguard role is absolute
 and indispensable.
 ? Self-sacrifice: Hu is critical of those who put their
 personal interests ahead of the party's and abuse the
 trust implicit in party membership.
 ? Discipline: special vigilance is required against those
 who resist the party line.
 ? The socialist system: its superiority must not be
 doubted.
 At the same time, Hu has pressed on issues that are
 not nearly so dear to the hearts of the party elders,
 and in fact has irritated many by raising sensitive
 issues publicly:
 ? Habitual "leftism": the most serious adverse legacy
 of the Cultural Revolution.
 ? The imperative of party reform: the basic lesson of
 Poland was that the party betrayed the Polish
 people-it was too dependent on the Soviet Union, it
 stressed production goals over people, and its leaders
 were corrupt.
 ? Rejuvenation: both the party and the state require
 an infusion of younger leaders as sources of energy
 and fresh ideas.
 ? Intellectuals: older party members must overcome
 their reservations about entrusting educated offi-
 cials with important duties.
 Hu's ideas-on this score nearly indistinguishable
 from Deng's-have prevailed completely on the ques-
 tion of bureaucratic reforms. In our assessment, the
 reform leadership, and Hu in particular, recognizes
 that durable reform ultimately requires filling the
 upper reaches of the bureaucracy with capable offi-
 cials who are relatively free of outdated policy biases.
 Hu has been a driving force behind bureaucratic
 rejuvenation and efforts to use college-educated offi-
 cials more efficiently. Moreover, Hu has goaded the
 process along by placing bureaucratic rejuvenation on
 the party's public agenda, announcing via press inter-
 views, for example, that 70 percent of the leading
 party and state officials would be replaced by June
 1985.
 The 12th Party Congress in September 1982 marked
 a breakthrough-an unprecedented number of tech-
 nocrats were named to the Central Committee, partic-
 ularly to the rolls of alternate (nonvoting) members
 who are being groomed for eventual membership.' Hu
 once predicted that problems inside the party Central
 Committee would be solved by expelling some mem-
 bers and promoting others from the list of alternates,
 a tactic that may be implemented in September at an
 extraordinary party "conference of delegates.'
 Hu chairs the party committee that oversees the
 conduct of a rectification campaign, now in its second
 of three years, to reform the party and purge political-
 ly unreliable members. As early as 1979, Hu advocat-
 ed lenience for Cultural Revolution era malefactors,
 and, to date, the campaign has departed sharply from
 the party's previous rectification procedures-gruel-
 ing struggle sessions, public condemnations, and often
 violent confrontations. The current "mild rain, gentle
 breeze" approach to rectification is, above all, practi-
 cal: Hu and his colleagues recognize that, because
 millions of Chinese were involved in wrongdoing, a
 ' Of 210 members of the 12th Central Committee, more than half
 were new or promoted from the list of 11th Central Committee
 alternates. More than two-thirds of the new members were under
 60 years old, and about a fifth of the entire committee were
 functional specialists.

 public policy of forgiving and forgetting is politically
 more suitable and creates fewer anxieties among
 officials than an open settling of scores."
 The Military
 Hu's public remarks on the military generally do not
 reflect an original viewpoint. Most often he confines
 himself to standard exhortations on military policy
 and generally echoes Deng's views. We presume that
 Hu accepts the essentially derivative status of the
 military in China's modernization scheme-the civil-
 ian economy must improve before greater material
 allocations can be directed toward Army moderniza-
 tion.
 Hu has been an active spokesman in the campaign to
 convince soldiers of the reasonableness of Beijing's
 military policies. Like Deng, Hu clearly favors the
 professionalization of the armed forces and a reduced
 role for senior soldier-politicians at the top level of
 decisionmaking. He has strongly endorsed Deng's
 sweeping plans to streamline and rejuvenate the mili-
 tary, such as the 1-million-man reduction in troop
 strength and the wholesale shakeup of military com-
 mands announced in June 1985.
 Hu apparently is concerned, however, about whether
 veteran officers will continue to support the reform
 program. Publicly, Hu asserts his confidence that the
 People's Liberation Army is absolutely trustworthy
 and loyal to the party
 Hu appears to recognize that it may be helpful to
 court the military. He seems at pains to express his
 good intentions, such as in an interview last fall when
 he conceded that, although the Army had a dispropor-
 tionate number of problems left over from the Cultur-
 al Revolution, these difficulties were being handled
 Hu observes military maneuvers in 1981 with
 Deng Xiaoping (left) and Beijing Military Region
 without rancor. He implied that most Cultural Revo-
 lution-era troublemakers in the military would simply
 be retired at full pay rather than suffer additional
 punishment because they had merely followed orders
 and previously had been brave and loyal.
 At the same time, Hu typically seems either confident
 or intemperate enough to risk the ire of military
 leaders by making provocative statements. For exam-
 ple, while in New Zealand in April, Hu, without
 apparent authorization, announced to a press confer-
 ence the 1-million-man demobilization, which had not
 yet been publicly disclosed in China. Shortly there-
 after, he suggested in an interview that the chairman-
 ship of the party Military Commission was a fitting
 post for an old man such as Deng because, "to tell the
 truth, there are not a lot of things to do in the army."
 He then added, "We let Deng hold a concurrent post
 (he is also Chairman of the Central Advisory Com-
 mission) ... enabling us to attend to urgent matters."
 Foreign Policy
 From the time he joined the Politburo Standing
 Committee in 1980 until about mid-1982, when he
 had been party chairman for a year, Hu most often
 addressed questions involving his areas of greatest

 Secret
 competence-party policy and personnel. On those
 few occasions that Hu spoke on the relatively unfamil-
 iar topics of economics and foreign policy, he rarely
 strayed from his talking points. Since approximately
 mid-1982, however, this no longer seems the case.
 Hu's willingness to speak out on China's foreign
 relations is directly related to his growing involvement
 in the formulation of foreign policy. Since late 1978,
 Deng Xiaoping has always had pride of place within
 the small circle of officials who deliberate China's
 foreign policy. In 1981 Hu told visitors that foreign
 affairs was the responsibility of Deng along with Zhao
 and Li Xiannian.
 IIn his
 recent actions and statements, Hu, in our view, seems
 fully to expect to inherit Deng's leading role in foreign
 policy. Indeed, part of that reponsibility may already
 have shifted: Hu now appears the leader most closely
 associated with China's relations with Japan, North
 Korea, and some East European countries.
 Our examination of Hu's foreign policy record leads
 us to conclude that:
 ? Compared with leaders such as Deng and Zhao, Hu
 appears much less favorably disposed to closer
 relations with the United States.
 ? He has taken a consistently harder line on the
 Taiwan question and particularly the role of the
 United States as Taiwan's protector.
 ? Hu may have fewer reservations about improving
 relations with the Soviet Union.
 ? Hu's foreign policy views are more doctrinaire than
 Deng's-his foreign policy outlook seems the com-
 bined product of visceral nationalism and a relative-
 ly narrow perspective conditioned by more than 50
 years of Communist activism.
 United States. Almost a year before China publicly
 broke with the "united front against (Soviet) hege-
 monism" line and invoked China's "independent for-
 eign policy" at the 12th Party Congress, a diplomatic
 source reported a divergence of opinion between Deng
 and Hu over relations with the United States.' Ac-
 cording to the source, Hu favored a more passive
 foreign policy that was less closely identified with the
 United States and more oriented toward Third World
 interests. The two leaders agreed, however, that Chi-
 na should seek no closer ties to the Soviet Union.
 Although these differences appear mainly matters of
 weight and degree, Hu's reported preferences were
 fully represented at the 12th Party Congress and
 given authoritative endorsement by the Central Com-
 mittee.
 Other diplomatic sources confirmed the differing
 foreign policy slants of Deng and Hu. In accounts of a
 top-level meeting held in March 1983, Deng defended
 the foreign policy line of 1978-82, while Hu specifical-
 ly reminded attendees of his personal reservations
 about the previous attempt to forge a de facto alliance
 with the United States.
 Although we do not have a full picture of Hu's foreign
 policy views, one point that appears incontrovertible is
 his suspicion of the United States as a reliable foreign
 policy partner. When providing foreign visitors or
 journalists with a foreign policy tour d'horizon, Hu is
 generally moderate and sticks to standard policy
 formulations. When he departs from the standard
 brief, however, Hu seldom fails to criticize US policy
 more harshly than other Chinese leaders. Following
 are examples from a sizable list of Hu's blasts:
 ? In early 1981, when Beijing was still seeking, in
 Hu's words, "a kind of alliance" with the United
 States against the Soviets, foreign policy guidance
 quoted Hu's view of the Reagan administration as
 "reactionary, anti-Communist, and pro-Taiwan."
 ? In mid-1983, Hu told foreign visitors that Washing-
 ton does not honor its treaty commitments (specifi-
 cally, the Shanghai Communique) and continues to
 cherish a "one and a half Chinas" policy. There had
 been no major improvement in Sino-US relations,

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/06/22 : CIA-RDP04T00447R000200900001-3
 Hu avowed, since the breakthrough 1972 talks.
 (Around the same time, Deng was also questioning
 the reliability of the United States.)
 ? According to the official Chinese press, Hu heaped
 abuse on the United States before a Swedish Com-
 munist Party delegation in April 1983. "The United
 States has instituted a Taiwan Relations Act, per-
 sisted in its arms sales to Taiwan, connived in the
 enticement and coercion of Chinese athletes and
 students in collusion with Taiwan agents, and even
 granted `political asylum." These are all acts inter-
 fering in China's internal affairs, injuring China's
 sovereignty, and hurting the Chinese people's feel-
 ings. This is hegemonistic behavior."
 ? In remarks made last year
 echoed in his recent comments to the Hong Kong
 journal Pai Hsing, Hu charged that the United
 States keeps Taiwan "artificially alive" through
 special "blood transfusions," and that, without US
 interference, the problems of reunification would
 have been solved "years ago."
 ? Speaking                     last year, Hu
 characterized the United States bleakly as a nation
 in decline that had not had a leader of vision since
 the 1940s, that was disliked around the world, and
 that had a stark and growing gap between rich and
 poor.
 Taiwan. Although Beijing has consistently maintained
 that the Taiwan question is solely an internal affair,
 neither Hu nor many other national leaders discuss it
 outside the context of relations with the United
 States. In our view, Hu appears to regard the Taiwan
 question as more pressing than Deng, who seems to
 have a better feel for the limits of the practical. Hu's
 generally more xenophobic view of the West spills
 over into the Taiwan question.
 Hu has acted in a contradictory manner on the
 Taiwan question, at one time acknowledging that
 Beijing and Washington have an implicit understand-
 ing and at another time apparently breaching that
 understanding in a provocative way:
 Hu acknowledged the delicacy of the
 Taiwan connection in Sino-US relations and admit-
 ted that most issues could be finessed if the US
 Government would simply refrain from openly com-
 menting on Taiwan-related questions. It was the US
 Government continuing to comment on its commit-
 ment, even its "alliance," with Taiwan, Hu argued,
 that summoned forth harsh responses from Beijing.
 25X1
 ? Yet Hu himself focused the spotlight on Taiwan in          25X1
 the Pai Hsing interview of May 1985. There Hu,
 apparently in disregard of Deng's frequent asser-
 tions that China could impose a naval blockade
 around Taiwan, claimed that China was militarily
 unable to undertake such an operation, but, that in
 seven to 10 years, China would have the necessary
 capability, and perhaps the will. "If the broad
 masses of the Taiwan people wish (for reunification)         25X1
 and a small number of people do not, it will be
 necessary to use some force," Hu asserted.
 Soviet Union. Available evidence does not suggest
 that Hu is pro-Soviet. In our view, however, he is not
 as vehemently anti-Soviet as Deng. As with his record      25X1
 on other topics, Hu's statements on the Sino-Soviet
 relationship combine aspects of the official line to-
 gether with expressions that seem more personal.
 Consequently, his remarks have little internal consis-
 tency-he sometimes takes a position of exaggerated
 hostility, sometimes of exaggerated magnanimity. We
 are uncertain whether these inconsistencies reflect
 Hu's personal views or are mere posturing for effect.
 The record suggests, however, that Hu sees more
 openings than other leaders for improved relations
 with Moscow. For example, recent public references
 to the Soviet Union as a "socialist" country-the first

 Secret
 since the 1960s-reflect a view expressed by Hu since
 at least the late 1970s.
 ___]Hu's personal diplomacy in Eastern Europe-
 namely, his visit to Romania and Yugoslavia in
 1983-may in part be an effort to ease gradually and
 indirectly toward closer Soviet contacts.
 Hu, however, sees little prospect of a return to the
 halcyon days of Sino-Soviet alliance. In mid-1983, he
 told Japanese reporters that complete normalization
 of relations with the Soviets might take 20 or 30
 years, and even then, there would be no return to the
 alliance of the 1950s. Early the following year, diplo-
 matic sources in Beijing learned that East European
 callers on Hu found the Soviet portion of his foreign
 policy briefing to be "embarrassingly negative and
 sarcastic." Again in 1984, he noted that Moscow
 (following the Andropov accession) was seeking to
 create an impression that relations with Beijing are
 improving without having to concede a thing. Howev-
 er, Hu noted, their "chauvinism and ideological train-
 ing" keep them from actually changing their ways.
 Even though he may be moderately warmer toward
 Moscow, we estimate that a Hu-inspired repositioning
 within the Beijing-Moscow-Washington triangle
 would not amount to a full-blown rapprochement, but
 perhaps would incline Beijing toward an attempt to
 achieve a position of equidistance between the two
 great powers. Based on our assessment of the record,
 we believe Hu may favor a less confrontational ap-
 proach to China's relations with the Soviet Union
 than Deng Xiaoping, whom Moscow considers the
 most anti-Soviet of China's leaders. As a corollary to
 this view, Hu may be willing to sacrifice aspects of the
 US connection in the interests of improved relations
 We are uncertain whether developments in Sino-
 Soviet relations since last fall represent a leadership
 consensus that Hu obeys rather than drives. These
 recent events are suggestive but not conclusive:
 ? In his trip to the Mongolian border last fall, Hu
 called for making the city of Erenhot an inland
 special economic zone, implying that he favored a
 major improvement in Sino-Soviet economic
 relations.
 ? In March, through Vice Premier Li Peng, Hu
 conveyed his congratulations to Mikhail Gorbachev
 upon his accession to Soviet party leadership, term-
 ing the Soviet leader "comrade."
 ? The following month, in a session with Hong Kong
 journalists, Hu acknowledged that Sino-Soviet rela-
 tions are abnormal but pointedly refrained from the
 ritual recitation of the "three obstacles" to Sino-
 Soviet normalization'-even claiming he did not
 know precisely how many obstacles there were-
 stating only as a general condition for improving
 relations that Moscow must eliminate Beijing's feel-
 ings of insecurity on its borders.
 ? In the Hong Kong interview, Hu added that there
 were no obstacles to upgrading contacts between
 Beijing and Moscow, even to the possible exchange
 of visits by premiers.
 Strategic Considerations. Deng is commonly credited
 with the strategic vision to have seen that China's best
 chance for realizing its domestic economic goals
 called for continuity with the foreign policy of Mao
 and Zhou Enlai-that is, an end to Chinese isolation-
 ism and cooperation with the West and Japan both for
 the economic benefits and as a strategic counter-
 weight to the Soviet Union. Hu's vision appears to
 differ in important respects, especially regarding the
 relative distance between the two superpowers. In-
 deed, some Soviet observers tend to view Hu as a man
 ' The three obstacles are that Moscow should end its support for
 Vietnam in Kampuchea, withdraw from Afghanistan, and reduce
 with the Soviets.

 A high-stakes bridge game: Hu
 and an unidentified placer
 against Deng (right) and Secre-
 tariat memher Hu Qili. Politi-
 huro member Wan Li (standing)
 looks on
 Moscow might be able to bargain with, and believe
 that, with Hu in charge, there will be better prospects
 for improved Sino-Soviet relations.
 Ideology and Intellectual Freedom
 llu .4s a "Liberal." Hu has taken controversial stands
 on artistic freedom but has then bowed to party
 traditionalists when political exigencies so dictated.
 During the summer of 1981, Hu endorsed, then
 criticized "Bitter Love," a screenplay by Bai Hua that
 satirized Mao and the party and drew heavy fire from
 Army conservatives. He subsequently attacked Bai's
 critics, however, insisting that their hasty and unrea-
 sonable reaction had actually generated support for
 Bai. At the same time, Chinese writers believed that
 Hu was forced to yield to conservative pressure but
 held that he remained their advocate. According to a
 diplomatic source, Bai Hua himself told a confidant,
 "No matter what Hu feels compelled to say about me
 and my writings, I know that in his heart he is a
 liberal and supports me.1
 The available evidence suggests that Bai's judgment is
 apt. Hu's own interview style indicates a firm belief
 that public discourse in China should be freer, and
 that writers should have greater latitude. Neverthe-
 less, IN above all is a political creature, leader of an
 organization accustomed to exercising control by es-
 tablishing limits. The current economic and political
 trend, in which reforms proceed with only thin ideo-
 logical justification, requires lipservice to some tradi-
 tional Communist expressions, occasionall} followed
 up by tougher sanctions against those who exceed
 unspoken ideological boundaries
 Hu as a Pragmatic Politician. As party chief, I lu
 must attempt to bridge the perennial gap between the
 party regulars' demands for ideological discipline and
 orthodoxy and the intellectuals' desire for greater
 expressive freedoms. He has been a leader in the
 party's effort to woo intellectuals to the party pro-
 gram, but at the same time is responsible  as the
 party's chief ideological spokesman-- for defining the
 borderline between acceptable and unacceptable ide-
 ology, tolerable and intolerable expression. Hu's w a-
 vering on this question has provided critics on both
 sides ample opportunity to find fault with his perfor-
 mance.
 Hu's speech of 8 February on party journalism neatly
 underscores his dilemma." First of all, it is a tough,
 A The speech was not published until 14 April, presunutbly berme
 of its controversial contents, the corresponding need to acquire the
 endorsement of senior leaders, and, probably, because earlier
 publication would have appeared to negate the party's endorsement
 of artistic freedom publicized at the December 1984 Januan I98~
 Writers Conference. At that session, IN Yaobang's protege Hu
 Qili, serving as spokesman for his mentor, pronounced a polie> of

 secret
 ideologically orthodox talk, almost certainly prompted
 by conservative critics of the trend toward relaxed
 restrictions in literature. At the outset, Hu noted that
 the official press must serve as "the mouthpiece of the
 party" and contrasted journalism to artistic creation,
 saying that freedom of creation does not require
 editors to publish any item a writer submits. In his
 most dogmatic moment, Hu maintained that, in Chi-
 na, it is unnatural for the press to speak in "different
 voices" because all Chinese have the same opinions,
 which are represented faithfully by the Central Com-
 mittee and the State Council. When asked by a Hong
 Kong journal to reconcile his speech to his relatively
 "enlightened" public record on artistic freedoms, Hu
 responded, "Being enlightened should not make me
 the sagacious elder statesman. Most importantly,
 Deng must believe that Hu will continue to support
 the policies both have worked to set in place.
 The designation of a political heir in China, however,
 is risky." Named successors automatically become the
 target of all who wish to try for power. Hu's rise under
 Deng's tutelage and his willingness to stake out
 extreme positions have drawn fire from numerous
 critics. During his five years atop the party bureau-
 cracy, Hu has absorbed much of the criticism and
 little of the credit for China's policies, and he is
 personally associated with the most controversial as-
 pects of the reforms. Indeed, it falls to the party chief
 to balance competing views, and this is a task for
 which keenly partisan Hu seems particularly
 lose principles!"
 On economic questions, however, Hu permits few
 principles to encumber him and has a well-deserved
 reputation as a pragmatist. Combined with his often
 ill-concealed contempt for China's "leftist" propagan-
 da apparatus, Hu's approach to finding ideological
 justifications for economic policy seems almost cyni-
 cal
 It was Hu Yaobang's speech to theoretical
 workers in November 1984 that provided the key text
 for a controversial People's Daily commentator of 7
 December, which argued that, in light of contempo-
 rary developments, "Marxism cannot solve China's
 problems." (The following day, this was corrected to
 read "Marxism cannot solve all China's problems.")
 Will Hu Stay the Course?
 Political Concerns
 Several considerations must originally have motivated
 Deng to choose Hu as his successor. Deng obviously
 saw him as a pugnacious man who would goad the
 party bureaucracy into action, work long hours at-
 tending to necessary detail, staff important projects,
 go on provincial tours, and thereby permit Deng to be
 unsuited.
 Partly because of his stylistic quirks, Hu has had
 problems winning the full approbation of senior party
 traditionalists.
 leaders such as Standing Committee member Chen
 Yun, Premier Zhao Ziyang, and even Deng Xiaoping,
 have at one time or another been critical of Hu's
 performance. Hu has never quite been able to shake
 the perception that, because he jumps too easily to
 conclusions and is too readily tempted to impetuous
 action, he is not quite up to the job of party General
 Secretary.

 Hu Qili---rumored in line to
 replace Hu Yaobang as General
 Hu arouses strong emotions in both his supporters and
 his detractors, and the pressures of high office per-
 haps are beginning to tell. He is 70 years old and
 perhaps slowing down---during his recent trip to
 Australia and New Zealand, Hu canceled a day of
 activities because of exhaustion. On several occasions
 recently, Hu suggested to foreign reporters that he
 will leave his post at the 13th Party Congress in 1987.
 Whether or not Hu Qili ultimately accedes to IN
 Yaobang's position, Hu remains the most prominent
 party leader of his generation and the one best
 positioned to try for Deng's authority once Deng dies
 or becomes incapacitated. The looming question be-
 fore both Chinese and foreign policymakers must be:
 will IN Yaobang continue China's present policy
 course when Deng is gone')
 In our view, the answer is a guarded "yes.'' Our
 revie~N of flu's record suggests that, on most issues,
 Deng and Hu are like minded. Hu may be willing to
 go a bit faster on economic reform, may have some
 reservations on China's foreign policy, and may be
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/06/22 : CIA-RDP04T00447R000200900001-3
 more tentative in his relations with senior soldier-
 politicians. He is certainly willing to go a bit farther
 toward an ideological reformation and toward grant-
 ing individual freedoms that would satisfy the de-
 mands of Chinese intellectuals for a greater stake in
 reform.
 Yet without Deng, Hu will be subject to different
 political pressures and may be less able to work his
 own will. Deng presumably- has kept the party elders
 at bay while gradually devolving greater authority to
 Hu. In most instances, Hu's words gained additional
 credibility because of his role as Deng's spokesman.
 When Deng is gone, Hu will have to deal more
 directly with Deng's generational peers, who are aged
 and tired but still politically formidable. Even with
 Deng's protection, Hu has been forced to concede to
 the old guard on issues such as ideology, simply in the
 interest of preserving a rough leadership consensus.
 Both the issues and Hu's policy positions are complex
 enough for Hu to be turned in a variety of directions,
 according to political exigency:
 ? We expect Hu to continue to mind his party con-
 cerns first: challenges to party control during the
 course of reform, as when intellectuals attempt to
 question the party's primacy, will be met decisive-
 ly-the important political voices in Beijing are
 unanimous on this score.
 ? Hu will continue to press for organizational changes
 but may encounter greater resistance without
 Deng's mediating influence. Exceptions to the re-
 tirement rulings have already been allowed, and it
 may be politic for Hu to allow several more in the
 post-Deng period.
 ? If Hu accedes to the Military Commission chair-
 manship, it will presumably be under institutional
 arrangements set by Deng. The May-June 1985
 meeting of the commission has established a series
 of military reforms that probably can proceed with-
 out Deng's direct attention.

 ? Hu's economic views, because they are so imperfect-
 ly formed, may be swung about by advisers' urgings,
 but his record since 1978 indicates that he is
 basically satisfied with-and proud of-China's
 performance, and will generally remain an advocate
 of current policies. Hu may curb his rhetorical
 excesses to placate party elders, but he seems to
 have no doubt that economic reform is vitally
 important for China. The "open-door" approach to
 trade with the West and promotion of market-style
 macroeconomic policies probably will continue.
 ? Foreign policy seems an arena for greater give and
 take after Deng's death, and Hu's position may be
 particularly susceptible to political and emotional
 influence.
 ? Although the record is clouded on his views toward
 the Soviet Union, Hu may genuinely believe that
 China would improve its position within the triangu-
 lar relationship if it reaches some kind of accommo-
 dation with Moscow. If so, in our view, this would
 jeopardize Deng's more carefully crafted foreign
 policy, which appears inextricably entwined with
 the need to enlist Western participation in China's
 economic development.
 ? Hu, however, is not pro-Soviet, and his critical views
 of both the Soviet Union and the United States
 generally are shared by all of China's leaders,
 including Deng. Hu's tone and style along with his
 much narrower perspective, however, suggest that
 he, unlike Deng, might steer China to pursue a truly
 independent foreign policy.
 ? Responding to domestic political pressures, Hu may
 seek favor among more conservative leaders at the
 Politburo level who
 favor more rapid improvement of relations with the
 Soviets and, perhaps, greater distance from the
 United States.
