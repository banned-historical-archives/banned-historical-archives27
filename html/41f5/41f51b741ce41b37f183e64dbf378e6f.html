WASHINGTON POST 
Senate Votes 
Curb on Pay 
To Viet Allies 
By Spencer Rich 
? Washington Post Staff Writer 
The Senate plunged into a 
new debate yeiterday on pro-
posals to restrict US. finane. 
ing for what critics call "fon 
eign mercenaries" fighting in 
Indochina. 
By voice vote, senators lip, 
proved an amendment forbid 
ding U.S. payinents of Special 
t Korean or any other 
troops 
for Thai, 
troops in excess of the combat 
pay levels being received bY 
U.S. soldiers. 
Foreign Relations Commit 
tee Chairman J. W. Fulbright 
(D-Ark.) said a subconirnitte 
headed by Stuart Symington 
(D Mo) had, with extreme difJ, 
ficult y, extracted statistll 
from the administration. '-
See DEFENSE, Al2, do 
Yti 
DATE AV4 
' 
revealed that a Thai 
t nant general fighting in 
11 Vietnam would receive 
$5,400 a year in U.S.-financed 
special combat pay, while an 
American officer of equival-
ent rank got only $780 extra. 
Fulbright said the American 
people, unaware for years of 
the secret agreements with 
Thailand, the Philippines and 
South Korea "Were ?cohtinually 
told by their leaders" that 
in Vietnam represented ?recog-
in Vitnam represented recog-
nition that all Asian nations 
had a stake in Vietnam. That 
stake, it now turns`ottt, was in 
good part money." , 
Fulbright also called up a 
second and much farther 
reaching "anti-mercenary" 
amendment to the $19.3-billion 
defense procurement bill. It 
would prohibit U.S. financing 
of Vietnamese or Thai mili-
tary operations on behalf of 
either the Cambodian or Lao-
tian governments. A vote on it 
may collie today. 
Fulbright said its purpose 
was to make sure that the 
U.S., without congressional as-
nt, does not begin financing 
tnamese or Thai military 
tures that could escalate 
it in Laos, risk provok-
ed China into interven-
-there or involve the U.S. 
aid to South Vietnamese 
rces?"in propping up the 
Lbn Nol government" in Cam-
bodia "through third parties." 
The Senate Armed Services 
Committee, in its report on 
the proprement bill, had in 
eluded a paragraph attempt-
ing to make clear that funds 
should not be used to finance 
thlth Vietnamese interven-
tion on behalf of the Cambo-
dian government. 
But Fulbright said this 
should be made applicable to 
both Thai and South Viet-
namese troops and broad-
ened to include intervention 
on behalf of Laos,. 
The excess pay amendment 
was accepted by Armed Serv-
ices Committee Chairman, 
John Stennis (D-Miss.), who 
said he would be glad to take 
it to a House-Senate confer-
ence but ?6 feti fie could 
insist on f milication to 
existing agreements with for-
eign nations. He gaid, how-
ever, h? would ask for its an-
plieatidn to future payment 
agreeinents and would also 
seek full reports from the \ ad-
ministration on details of 
agreements. 
Earlier yestercity, the Sen-
ate debated for hours an ad-
ministration-oppoSed amend-
ment by Mark Hatfield (R-
Ore.) and Barry Goldwater 
(R-Ariz.) to experiment with 
the concept a an all-volunteer 
army. Hatfield said the amend-
ment would ,raise military pay 
now and thus allow the Pen-
tagon to determine ? a year 
before the current draft law 
runs out?whether added in-
ducements would make it pos-
sible to depend on volunteer 
only. 
Objecting, Edward M. Ken-
nedy (D-Mass.) said cyllege 
students, in the current war 
time situation, would simply 
not volunteer and "we're go 
ing to have the poor people 
of this country end up being 
the volunteers" to "fight rich 
men's wars." Stennis predict. 
ed the war "will continue for 
some time under the policy 
The President" and volun-
teers would not fill manpower 
needs.

YORK TIMES 
SENATE ASKS CURB 
ON WAR PAY GOING 
TO VIETNAM ALLIES 
Votes to Forbid Allowances 
? Higher Than Those Paid 
American Soldiers 
By ROBERT M. SMITH 
SPecial to The New York, Times 
WASHINGTON, Aug. 20 ? 
The Senate voted today to bar 
the United States from paying 
larger allowances to ?allied: 
troops in Vietnam than it pays 
to American soldiers. 
Special allowances have been 
given three countries ?Thai-
land, South Korea and the Phil-
ippines ? for troops that they 
sent to Vietnam. It was dis-
closed in testimony before a 
Senate subcommittee that the 
allowances granted to these 
troops exceeded the allowances 
paid to United States military 
personnel in Vietnam. 
The allowance- for G.I.'s, for 
example, was put at $65 a 
month, but "twice that for 
Thai and South Korean troops," 
the committee was told. 
The Senate, which has been 
caught up in wrangle after 
wrangle on amendments to the 
military procurement bill, took 
only 50 minutes to debate the 
proposal, offered by Senator J. 
W. Fullbright, Democrat of Ar-
kansas. The Senate then passed 
the amendment by unanimous 
voice vote. 
The only Senator speaking 
against the proposal was Strom 
Thurmond, Republican of South 
Carolina. Mr. Thurmond urged 
that "nothing be done to? cause 
these 69,000 troops from free 
world countries to be with-
drawn." 
In presenting-his amendment, 
Senator Fulbright pointed out 
that a Senate Foreign Relations 
subcommittee discovered in 
hearings last fall and winter 
that the United States was pay-
ing allowances to allied troops 
that were about double the 
allowances paid to its own 
servicemen. 
State and Defense Depart-
ment testimony before the sub-
committee on United States 
security agreements and com-
mitments abroad disclosed that 
while Thailand was paying its 
majors $98 a month in base 
pay, the United States was pay-
ing them $180 more in over-
seas allowances. Thailand was 
paying its privates $26 a month; 
the United States was paying 
them $39 more a month. 
AecOrdifig to testimony at 
the hearings, the Philippines 
r I 
was paying its captains $125 a 
month, and the United States 
was paying them $150 more a 
month. The Philippines paid its 
master sergeants $53 a month, 
and the United States was pay-
ing them $76 a month. 
Senator Fulbright alsoointed 
outthat each South Orn 
a, 
Ic 
soldier leaving South Vietnam 
got 40 cubic feet of personal 
cargo space on the ship taking 
him home. The Koreans use 
the space, the Senator said, to 
take home American beer, C-ra-
tions, cigarettes and Amerthan 
electrical products. 
"It is time," Senator Ful-
bright said, "to stop tnakin 
mercenaries out of allies, an 
allies out of mercenaries. You 
should not pay overseas Or 
combat pay to a foreign soldier 
more than to an American sol-
dier." 
Senator John Stennis. Demo-
crat of Mississippi, who heads 
the Armed Services Commit-
tee, agreed: "I'm in'tpre-Sted 
with it, and if some adjustment 
can be made consistent with 
our honor, I'd like to see it 
done." 
Senator Stennis promised he 
would try to get the House of 
Representatives to go along 
with the provision in the joint 
conference committee that will 
haVe to try to work out an 
agreement between the two 
houses on the final military 
procurement bill. 
But Senator Stennismade 
? two admonitions: That the 
United States would?haVe to 
observe any commitments it 
might have already made, and 
that some delicacy might be 
necessary since American 
forces are leaving Vietnam. As 
he put it, "We are withdraw-
? ing, and I don't feel we should 
.go in there with a meat axe." 
Goldwater Backs Amendment 
Senator Barry Goldwater, 
Republican of Arizona, said he 
agreed with the amendment 
and asked whether it would be 
"improper to ask either the 
Department of State or the De-
partment of Defense to make 
reports on what foreign troops 
are paid." 
"You talk about getting re-
i5orts," Senator Fulbright re-
plied. "It took six months to 
get this one report" for the 
subcommittee last fall. The 
Senator noted, at another point, 
that "Congressional approval 
was neither sought nor given" 
for the allowances. 
Senator Fulbright also said 
that the quarterly reports the 
Defense Department did sub-
mit to Congress grossly under-
estimated the actual outlays. 
He said that a report done by 
the General Accounting office 
for the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee found that the United 
States had given the Philip. 
pines $40.8-million from the 
fiscal year 1966 through the 
second quarter of 1970, while 
the Pentagon reported having 
provided only $17.3-million. 
Urging that the Senate not 
take hasty action against al-
l**, Senator Thurmond said: 
"1.-1e induced them to help us. 
TY:ey are helping to bail us 
out." 
This brought Senator Charles 
H. Percy to his feet. "We are 
there helping them," the Illinois 
Republican declared. "They are 
there protecting themselves. 
We are not in danger." 
Senator Fulbright said sev-
- .oral times that the allied troops 
were not in Vietnam to fight 
but were only there for their 
propaganda value. 
"The Filipinos didn't do an 
Iota of fighting," he charged 
"We paid them very well to gc 
down there and sit on their he. 
hinds." 
In regard to the Thais, hi 
quoted what he said was tin 
remark of an American sol 
dier: "The only way you car 
get the Thais to fight is to Pu' 
a PX between them and thi 
? VC."

should we fail to continue to hope and 
pray that freedom will be restored to 
Czechoslovakia and the other nations 
subject to Soviet domination. 
A TRIBUTE TO THE PEOPLE OF 
CZECHOSLOVAKIA 
Mr. PERCY. Mr. President, on this 
August 21 it is fitting that we pause and 
Pay tribute to the people of Czechoslo-
vakia; for it was 2 years ago today that 
the Soviet-led forces of the Warsaw 
Pact occupied Czechoslovakia and pro-
ceeded tot bring to an end the Czecho-
slovakia experiment in liberalization. 
Much has been written about this 
latest tragedy for Czechoslovakia. Care-
fully recorded in the press, in periodical 
literature, and in books are the develop-
ments of these past 2 years during 
which the Soviets have succeeded in un-
doing the work of the reformers and re-
turning the country to its former path of 
rigid orthodoxy. Symbolically, this task 
was completed by Prague's acceptance of 
the "Brezhnev Doctrine" as formulated 
within the recently concluded Soviet-
Czechoslovak treaty. 
An important point about the events 
prior to the Soviet intervention was the 
dramatic manifestation of the Czecho-
slovak desire for freedom. The pressure 
for reform came from below, from the 
people, and was translated into political 
action ironically by a Communist lead-
ership that itself could not escape its 
awesome influence. 
What was taking place during the few 
months prior to the intervention was the 
resurgence of the irrepressible spirit of 
freedom that is deeply rooted in the peo-
ples of Czechoslovakia. 
On this anniversary, therefore, let us 
turn our thoughts to the people of 
Czechoslovakia and once more dedicate 
ourselves to the proposition that one day 
they will regain their freedom. 
FLIGHT SERVICE STATIONS OB-
SERVE GOLDEN ANNIVERSARY?
AIR TRAFFIC SPECIALISTS PRO-
VIDE VITAL SAFETY EFFORT - 
Mr. RANDOLPH. Mr. President, this 
week marks the golden anniversary of 
flight service stations, a far-reaching 
network of 340 facilities operated by the 
Federal Aviation Administration to pro-
vide a wide range of aeronautical serv-
ices. 
Originally established by the Post Of-
fice on August 20, 1920, to support the 
early airmail service, these facilities have 
phased from bonfires to beacons to broad-
casts. From wireless to computers they 
have bridged civil aviation's communi-
cations and navigations gap?from the 
primitive "spark" and "arc" transmitting 
devices to solid state and remote con-
trol equipment. 
The original string of 17 airway radio 
stations, for the most part, stretched over 
desolate wilderness and high mountain 
passes. Some stations were accessible 
only by mule train; others by skis and 
sleds. The one room shacks were drab 
and drafty, generally manned by a lone 
operator who worked 7 days a week on a 
split shift. His communications equip-
ment was sketchy and primitive. Four of 
the original stations have been in con-
tinuous operation since 1920: Elko, Nev.; 
Rock Springs, Wyo.; Salt Lake 'City, 
Utah; and Washington, D.C. 
Like the first airmail pilots and other 
pioneers of flight, the men and women 
who kept them flying?the ground sup-
port specialists, the airway radio oper-
ators?were equally intrigued by avia-
tion. They had a mission and they pro-
vided a service. Their work began before 
dawn and it ended after dark. Quite lit-
erally, they laid the foundation for to-
day's airway network. 
The Federal Aviation Administration 
this week is commemorating the first 50 
years of flight service stations, with a 
series of national events including open 
houses, radio and television programs, 
and other community festivities. 
But amid the visitors and public at-
tention, the quiet, resolute work of FAA's 
4,600 air traffic specialists continues. Over 
the counter, over the phone, or over the 
radio flight service specialists are provid-
ing assistance around the clock to safe-
guard our Nation's pilots. Specialists of-
fer thorough preflight briefings and 
weather forecasts; alert airborne pilots 
by radio of expected weather conditions 
and assist them in charting alternative 
courses; and broadcast information 
about special airport conditions and nav-
igational aides that might be temporar-
ily out of commission. And if a pilot runs 
low on fuel or gets lost, the calm, steady-
ing voice of the air traffic specialist is 
with him in the cockpit to guide him out 
of danger. Help is just the push of a 
microphone button away. 
I congratulate FAA Administrator 
John H. Shaffer, and the employees of 
FAA, particularly the flight service sta-
tion personnel, on this 50th anniversary 
of Flight Servide Stations. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that my congratulatory telegram to 
the West Virginia Flight service stations 
be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the telegram 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows:

, JENNINGS RANDOLPH, 
U.S. Senator. 
THE IMPORTANCE OF LAND RE-
FORM IN SOUTH VIETNAM 
Mr. MAGNUSOk. Mr. President, this 
year, an event of fundamental signifi-
cance has taken place: the National As-
sembly of South Vietnam has passed, 
and President Thieu has signed, what 
the New York Times has termed "the 
most ambitious and progressive non-
Communist land reform program of the 
20th century." 
There can be no doubt that this action 
should have taken place long ago?I 
have been attempting to persuade the 
State Department on this point for many 
years. But there can also be no question 
that past failure to enact a land reform 
program in South Vietnam should not 
dissuade us from taking action to speed 
up implementation of the "Land to the 
Tiller Act," while land reform is possible 
and still important. The benefits of rapid 
implementation of land reform could be 
considerable, both in terms of American 
lives saved and in terms of the future 
stability of South Vietnam. 
Land reform is not a simple issue; 
many people who would support it if they 
fully understood its significance are 
mi-
certain about many facets of the pro-
gram. The questions that land reform 
poses can and should be answered, be-
cause understanding the importance of 
land reform is critical to understanding 
the nature of the forces at work in South 
Vietnam and in modernizing nations 
throughout the world. 
My remarks today have this aim: to 
explain the significance of land reform 
in modernizing nations generally; to re-
capitulate briefly the history and pros-
pects of land reform in South Vietnam 
particularly; to explain why land reform 
can and should be carried out there ir-
respective of the time table for American 
troop withdrawal; and to demonstrate 
that such reform is truly in the best and 
expressed iterests of the people of South 
Vietnam, regardless of the government 
that is in power there at the present time 
and regardless of the nature of any gov-
ernment that may come to power in the 
future. 
My earnest hope is that Senators and 
their staffs will take the time to review 
these remarks, and to see how land re-
form in South Vietnam is compatible 
with each of the many views about the 
war in South Vietnam held by members 
of this body. This is not a partisan issue, 
nor an issue that will divide supporters 
and opponents of the President's war 
policies?something that a glance at the 
list of supporters will indicate immedi-
ately. At the very least, the Senate should 
ponder the importance of land reform so 
that conflicts like that in Vietnam can 
be avoided or minimized in the future.

, MODERN WING NATIONS GENERAL LN 
Whether we refer to the nations 01. 
lie Third World as -"modernizing," 
"emerging," or -developing," we can 
easily recognize that the types of change 
a nation experiences on the road from 
tradition to modernity are difficult ones 
that may cause tremendous political in-
si.ability, The process of change involves 
the disruption of traditional institutions 
anti relationships that provided conti-
nuity and stability in the past. It is dur-
ing thie transition- phase from tradi-
tional institutions to more modern ones 
that a de-yeloping nation is most prone 
to -violence, insurrection, and retailution, 
the urban sector of modernizing na-
tions, important new political groups 
emerge during the process of moderniza-
tion and make demands upon the gov-
ernment and the political system. These 
groups -lnclude a proletariat, industrial-
ists, merchants and financiers, students. 
intellectuals and a military establish-
meet. The competing demands and vary-
ing strengths of these urban groups fre-
quently lead to urban unrest or rebel-
lion, which in turn may lead to a sac-
ceseion in governments or ruiing elites. 
fiecause most modernizing nations are 
predominantly rural, however, and be-
eause the impact of the central govern-
ment On these rural areas is generally

ter of the nation. Governments can and 
do enatete without affecting the way of 
life that. the great mass of the country's 
populace have followed for centuries. Be-
cause tee countryside remains passive

tion makes the impaet of such disrup-
tion massive if it should occur. 
hr ui al sector, like the urban sec-
(01 . must undergo fundamental changes 
IW fog medernization. Unlike the urban 
isictor, however, the rural sector is char-
acterized by only one traditional "fist-
isinen Ooi. rna)or importance: the pattern 
of landownership. In almost all tradi-
tional societies, the bulk of the land is 
owned by a small class of wealthy land-
lords. while the vast majority of those 
who actually till the soil do not own the 
land they work. As the modernizing in-
fluence spreads to the countryside, and 
as the desire for change accompanies it. 
it is this traditional landlord-tenant re-
lationship that becomes the focus of 
peasant unrest and revolutionary efforts. 
The peasant has a simple goal: to gain 
control of the land he tills. This simple 
redistributive aim of the peasant be-
comes a powerful force as the burden 
of rents, taxes and labor, and the uncer-
tainty of tenure with which the tenant 
lives, become intolerable. 
It is this universal objective of the 
peasantry, combined with its great num-
bers, that makes the peasant a most 
volatile and critical element. The peas-
ant's allegiance will belong to the party 
that gives him his land; as Mao Tse-
tung writes: 
Who ever solves the land question will win 
the peasant. 
The crucial question for a moderniz-
ing nation is whether the peasant is 
promised his land by the government or 
by those whose aim is to overthrow the 
government. 
It is this battle for the allegiance of 
the rural population that distinguishes 
contemporary guerrilla warfare in mod-
ernizing nations from traditional war-
fare between two sovereign nations. 
Rather than being faced with a military 
threat from foreign troops, the govern-
ments of many modernizing nations find 
themselves facing what is primarily a 
political/military threat from native 
guerrillas. These guerrillas do not ini-
tially attack government troops--they 
are far too weak and far too few in num-
ber to dissipate their resources at this 
stage. Instead, the guerrillas seek to build 
a political base of Support in the coun-
tryside, among the peasants who are in-
creasingly dissatisfied with the central 
government and its failure to bring about 
agrarian reform. As one expert has writ-
ten: 
Currant guerrilla warfare is the logical 
and planned result of building upon a foun-
dation of peasant discontent over land ten-
ure and the society shaped by it. 
This antigovernment guerrilla war-
fare takes the form of convincing the 
peasantry that the revolutionaries, 
rather than the government, can best 
respond to the peasant's needs. One of 
these needs is the need for protection, 
and the terrorist activities of the guer-
rillas during the early year.; of the con-
flict?including the assassination of vil-
lage headmen and even some peasants?
are designed to demonstrate that the 
government cannot or will not defend the 
peasantry, and that it is useless for the 
peasant to look to the government for 
protection or control. 
A less publicized, but much more sig-
nificant, eleffie:nt of antigovernment 
warfare is the promise of the guerrillas 
to turn the land over to the peasants. 
This has been a central theme of every 
major revolution or revolutionary at-
tempt in the 20th century. The revolu-
tionaries promise, and often carry out 
even during the conflict, land reform on a 
large scale. In contrast to the pledge and 
performance of the revolutionaries, the 
central government frequently uses its 
force to continue the hated institution 
of tenancy and the domination of the 
despised landownine classes_ 
Communist revolutionaries, from Lenin 
to Mao Tse-tung and Fidel Castro 
have recognized the ability of the peas-
antry to be mobilized as a force for 
revolution through the land tenure issue 
Lenin also recognized the ability of the 
central government. to command the 
peasant's loyalty through land reform. 
and so undermine the revolution?that 
is why, in prerevolution days, he de-
spaired of the revolution's success in the 
face of the redistributive Stolypin Re-
forms. Had Stolypin not been assassi-
nated in 1911, the course of the Russian 
Revolution might leave been a very dif-
ferent one. 
Mee and Castro made effective use of 
the land reform issue to build a powerful 
base, of support in the countryside, al-
lowing the revolutionaries to receive 
supplies, information, and hiding IN hen 
necessary. In Mexico and Bolivia, how-
ever, where land reform had been car-
ried out by non-Communist revolutions. 
the immunity of the peasantry to Com-
munist revolutionary fervor has been 
recognized by Communist and non-Com-
munist leaders alike. Che Guevara him-
self bemoaned the conservative ori-
entation of the Bolivian peasants, and 
attributed that orientation directly to 
the land reforms that had been carried 
out. 
Mexieo and Bolivia are the exceptions. 
however. In many other nations, the rev-
olutionary forces have not only prom-
ised land reform, but have carried it our 
in the areas within their control. Unfor-
tunately for the peasantry, however, the 
aftermath of successful Communist rev-
olutions has always been the brutal and 
bloody collectivization of peasant-held 
agricultural lands. This was true in the 
Soviet Union, in China, in Cuba, in North 
Korea., and in North Vietnam. This col-
lectivization process not only deprives 
the peasants of the land they held briefly_ 
but invariably results in wholesale 
slaughter of those who resist. Nonethe-
less, because "few peasants are histo-
rians," the appeal of the revolutionary 
slogans guarantees substantial peasant 
support for anti-government forces, par-
ticularly where the government has 
failed to undertake a competitive land 
reform program of its own. 
Nowhere has the appeal of land re-
form promised by the antigovernment 
forces been greater than in South Viet-
nam, where landownership is blata.nts 
inequitable. The Vietcong, and the Viet-
minh before, them, have actually given 
land over to the peasants in those prov-
inces where they have control. Not only 
does this drastically reduce whatever in-
centive the peasantry may have had to 
support the government, but it has made 
possible a high level of recruitment for 
the Vietcong. As one American military 
official has written, the Vietcong recruit-
ment effort is simple: "The movement 
gave you your land: now give us your 
son."

A government faced with a revolution-
ary threat during the early stages of 
modernization is thus faced with a bat-
tle for the support and allegiance of the 
peasantry. The alternative to allowing 
the peasants to become revolutionaries 
is, in theory at least, a simple one: the 
government must carry out reforms that 
give the land to the peasants. By doing 
so, the government gives the peasants a 
stake in the defense of the country, and 
insures that they will be an antirevolu-
tionary force. As Samuel P. Huntington, 
a distinguished student of developing na-
tions and the past chairman of the Gov-
ernment Department at Harvard Univer-
sity has written: 
The peasantry . . . may be the bulwark 
of the status quo of the shock troops of 
revolution Which role the peasant plays is 
determined by the extent to which the exist-
ing system meets his immediate economic 
and material needs as he sees them. These 
needs normally focus on land tenure and 
tenancy, taxes, and prices. Where conditions 
of land-ownership are equitable and provide 
a viable living for the peasant, revolution is 
unlikely. Where they are inequitable and 
where the peasant lives in poverty and suf-
fering, revolution is likely, if not hthritable, 
unless the government takes prompt meas-
ures to remedy these conditions. Ho social 
group is more conservative than a landown-
ing peasantry, and none is more revolution-
ary than a peasantry which owns too little 
land or pays too high a rental. The stability 
of government in modernizing countries is 
thus, in some measure, dependent upon its 
ability to promote reform in the countryside. 
IL OBSTACLES TO GOVERNMENT-INTTIATED 
LAND Foam 
As Huntington has written, in the ab-
sence of land reform, the peasants may 
be the key to revolution?or with land 
reform?the key to stability. Given the 
crucial "awing role of the peasant, land 
reform is thus the most important non-
military activity that a government 4 a 
modernizing nation can undertake. Why 
then is government-initiated land reform 
so rare a phenomenon in the 20th cen-
tury? 
The answer to this question is not that 
government leaders, as a group, have 
failed to perceive the importance of land 
reform?in fact, the opposite is true. But 
understanding the needlor land reform 
and carrying it out are two separate is-
sues. History is replete with examples of 
leaders who have tried valiant& to bring 
about land reform, but who have been 
unable to surmount the obstacle S in the 
path of this reform and who have con-
sequently been overthrown or deposed., 
The reasons why governments fail to 
carry out land reform even when they 
understand its importance are both po-
litical and financial. In most traditional 
or transitional societies, the landowning 
classes are a powerful political force with 
substantial bases of support in the cab-
--Viet, the assembly, or the court. Land re-
form is impossible without the acquies-
cence?voluntary or compelled?of the 
landowning class. Compulsion is rarely 
possible, because of the landowning class' 
political strength, and "voluntary acqui-
escence to land reform hinges on the gov-
ernment's ability to compensate the 
landlords for the lands to be distributed. 
Persuasion of the landlords to accept 
land reform has thus been possible pri-
marily in those nations?notably the oil-
producing nations of the Middle East?
where the government has sufficient rev-
enues to make land reform attractive to 
the landowners and peasants alike. 
Sometimes the recognition that the al-
ternative to land reform is revolution, 
and that revolution means the confisca-
tion of land without compensation, has 
made landlords more receptive to the 
government's program. As Prime Minis-
ter Amini told the landowners of Iran: 
Divide your lands or face revolution?or 
die. 
Land reform has traditionally foun-
dered, therefore, when the government 
of the modernizing nation has been too 
weak to confiscate the land and too poor 
to pay for it. This has meant, unfortu-
nately, that the two conditions under 
which land reform has been most suc-
ceasfully carried out are revolution and 
foreign occupation. Communist revolu-
tion has betrayed land reform in the end, 
as we have seen, although non-Commu-
nist revolutions such as those in Mexico 
and Bolivia have achieved more lasting 
results. Foreign occupation has produced 
results?in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan?
for the simple reason that the occupying 
power is not committed to the landown-
ing class and that an occupying power 
generally has the financial capability to 
carry out a land reform program of 
sweeping proportions. 
Fortunately, however, a willingness to 
provide financial assistance can be just 
as effective trs occupation, and a good 
deal less repugnant to both the foreign 
power and the country in which the re-
forms are to be carried out. The United 
States has recognized this periodically, 
as when we offered $60 million to the 
government of Peru to implement land 
reform there. 
Land reform assistance from the 
United States is a route that can and 
should be followed in South Vietnam. It 
is now consistent with the aims of the 
South Vietnamese Government, the de-
sire of the peasantry, the position of the 
landlords, and the goal of this Nation to 
end our military involvement in South 
Vietnam as quickly as possible. The rea-
sons for this will be explored in the next 
section of my remarks. 
In summary, land reform is the single 
most important nonmilitary activity of 
a developing nation faced with a revolu-
tionary threat. The success of the land 
reform effort will determine whether or 
' not the peasants become a force for po-
litical stability or a force for revolu-
tion?and the peasantry is generally the 
most crucial force in determining the 
future of a modernizing nation. Leaders 
of moderninzing nations, as well as their 
revolutionary opponents, 'have generally 
recognized the importance of land re-
form, but few governments have been 
able to finance such reform through their 
own revenues, and fewer still have been 
able to induce the landowning classes 
to accept land reform in the absence of 
adequate compensation. Foreign assist-
ance, whether through military occupa-
tion or financial aid, has been the single 
most effective agent for the implemen-
tation of land reform, short of revolu-
tion. Such land reform' has been 
instrumental in bringing political sta-
bility to otherwise unstable societies. 
Land reform made possible by foreign 
assistance or by non-Communist revolu-
tion has been a form of "preventive 
medicine" for revolution?cheaper by 
far than subsequent attempts to "cure" 
revolution by military means. In short, 
land reform determines, in Huntington's 
words, whether the peasants will be the 
bulwark of the status quo or the shock 
troops of revolution. 
III. LAND REFORM IN SOUTH VIETNAM: PAST AND 
PRESENT 
I recognize that for many people it is 
a long step between supporting land re-
form in principle and supporting land 
reform in South Vietnam, particularly 
land reform that is to be partially fi-
nanced with American funds. I would be 
the first to admit that the major impact 
of land reform in South Vietnam would 
have been 10 years ago, if it had been 
carried out at that time, rather than to-
day, when the conflict is advanced. 
There remain many reasons why the 
United States should help implement 
such reform today, however. Later on in 
my remarks, I will point out that by so 
doing, we not only will not prolong our 
military involvement in South Vietnam, 
but instead may hasten our departure 
and reduce our casualties substantially. 
And the price of land reform in Vietnam, 
will be less than the price paid by the 
United States in two days of combat. 
Circumstances are now such that the 
only remaining obstacle to successful 
land reform in South Vietnam is the 
potential lack of capital on the part of 
the government there, and all relevant 
parties?the peasantry, the landowners, 
the government of South Vietnam, and 
American AID officials?are prepared to 
implement a sound program, already 
passed into law, as funds are made 
available. 
The peasants of South Vietnam have 
a proverb that is filled with meaning 
for the situation today: 
He should own the land who rubs it 
each season between his hands. 
This centuries' old feeling helps ex-
plain why the peasantry has always been 
the key element of the indigenous anti-
government forces in South Vietnam?
since historically the land has not been 
owned by those who till it, and since 
the government of South Vietnam in 
the past has made no effort to redress 
this wrong the peasants feel. 
In two areas of Vietnam where the 
Vietcong are particularly Strong?the 
Mekong Delta and the Central Low-
lands?statistics demonstrate vividly the 
basis of peasant discontent. In its per-
centage of landlessness, the Mekong 
Delta is one of the five worst areas in 
the world: 73 percent of the peasants are 
substantially dependent on tenant 
farming. They pay, on the average, 34 
percent of their income in rent to the 
landlord, who provides few or no inputs. 
They exist on the land without any as-
surance that they will be "allowed" to 
remain on the land the following year. 
If the crop should fail, the rent is still 
due. Virtually no disposable surplus re-
mains of the crop, even in years of bum-
per harvests, after the landlord has been

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD? SENATE August ,V1, 1970 
paid. Conditions in the Central Low-
lands, where rents may exceed 50 per-
cent of the crop, are no better. Because 
of these and similar conditions, the Viet-
namese peasants in the Stanford Re-
search Institute field survey named land 
ownership five times more often than 
physical pecurity as a matter of chief 
concern to them. 
Despite these incendiary conditions, 
until recently neither the Government of 
South Vietnam nor LISAID officials have 
undertaken serious attempts to bring 
land reform to South Vietnam. The con-
trast with the Communists could not be 
more vivid. As Robert Sansern wrote: 
The Americans offered the peasant a con-
t;titution; 'the Viet Cong offeren hint his land 
and with it, the right to survive. 
The result, of course, has been that na-
tive guerrillas have always made up a 
huge percentage of the foices working 
for the overthrow of the South Vietnam-
ese Government. 
The Vietcong, like the Vietminh be-
fore them, have skillfully manipulated 
the peasantry by promising and carrying 
out land reform in those areas under VC 
control. The peasantry, in return, have 
supplied the bulk of the Vietcong fight-
ing force, and have actively aided the 
Vietcong by providing and caching ;sup-
plies. These same peasant guerrillas have 
been responsible for the laying of mines 
and boobytraps that have resulted in 
more than half of the American casual-
ties since the Tet offensive. These cas-
ualties, of course, have been greatly in-
creased because peasants hostile to the 
American and ARVIN]. forces have failed 
to warn our troops as they entered areas 
in which the land mines and boobytraps 
were placed. 
The Communists seized the initiative 
in the battle for the peasant's allegiance 
soon after World War IT. The Vietminh 
carried out land reform on a massive 
basis at a time when they controlled 60 
to 90 percent of South Vietnam. In the 
North, the Vietminh land reforms were 
cruelly and brutally, reversed in the col-
lectivization process than began after 
North Vietnam was constituted in 1954. 
In the south, however, the peasants in 
Vietnimh territory were allowed to hold 
on to their lands?until the Diem govern-
ment of South Vietnam began to reassert 
control. As Diem's troops regained 
province after province from the Viet-
minh, the landlords were restored to 
power and the peasantry resubjugated to 
the yoke of tenancy that the Communists 
had lifted from them years earlier. 
For this reason, the Communists hat e 
remained identified in the south as the 
agents Of land reform, while the govern-
ment has long been known ste the author-
ity responsible for keeping the landlords 
in power. With the government enforcing 
the rural status quo, and with the Com-
munists promising?and delivering?
land to the peasants, it is no great won-
der that the peasants hate harbored, 
aided, and fought on behalf of the Viet-
cong. 
Although President Diem i.trid Presi-
dent Eisenhower initially make token 
statements about the importance of land 
reform, both Saigon and the American 
command lapsed into the belief that this 
was a more or less traditional military 
struggle to be settled by traditional mili-
tary means; the fallacy of this approach 
has been amply demonstrated by the 
elusiveness of that "light at the end of 
the tunnel." When 'pacification" has 
meant landlords following triumphant 
American troops back into villages "lib-
erated" from, Vietcong control, it is no 
wonder that the pacification program has 
not realized our expectations for it. 
The first real indication that Saigon 
had become aware of the importance of 
land reform did not come until January 
of 1968. At that time, President Thieu 
undertook a massive land reform effort 
io win back the support of the peasan-
try. Former French lands, held by Diem 
the immediate past, were distributed 
to the peasants at an impressive rate. 
The following table demonstrates the 
dramatic progress made by this program, 
once it was aggressively undertaken: 
land distribution in South Vietnam: 1968-69 
[Acres distributed] 
January-June 1968  20, 000 
July-December 1968  40, 000 
Tanuary-August 1969  90, 000 
September-December 1969  90,000 
Not only did Thieu distribute the 
former French lands, but he decreed that 
..andlords should no longer be restored 
'n areas that came under the control of 
ARVN forces. To insure that landlords 
whose properties had already been re-
stored did not evict tenants in anticipa-
tion of future land reforms, Thieu also 
decreed an occupancy "freeze" to keep 
all tenants on the land he hoped?and 
still hopes?to give to them. Although 
there were some reversals in this pro-
gram, by late 1969 it was obvious that 
Thieu intended to make good on his 
new-found Pledge to give the lands to 
the peasantry and to win their support 
for the struggle against the Vietcong. 
The most significant among these 
many significant changes of attitude in 
Saigon was the passage, in March of this 
year, of a sweeping land reform program. 
President Thieu personally rallied sup-
nort in the National Assembly of South 
Vietnam, and. the result, as I stated at 
the outset, was one of the most dramatic 
and thorough land reform programs of 
the twentieth century. This plan, if fully 
araplemented. will pat ownership of all 
land directly into the hands of the peas-
ants tilling it, at no cost whatsoever to 
he peasant. The "land to the tiller" 
erogram can be substantially imple-
mented within the coming year and in 
lime for the next harvest, if financial 
,upport from the United States is forth-
eoming. 
Because of the importance of this 
land to the t:iller" program, and because 
lapid implementation of the program 
will be the goal of all Senators interested 
in this program, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert at this point in the REC-
ORD a description of the various titles of 
this act, prepared by Prof. Roy Proster-
rnan of the University of Washington 
haw School. A review of these sections 
will allow the Members of the Senate to 
I amiliarize themselves with the sections 
if the "land to the tiller" program, and 
to see that it is a practical plan with 
promise of being highly effective. 
There being no objection, the review 
was ordered to be printed in the REC-
ORD, as follows: 
Sec-rune LEVIEW 
Articles 1 and 2 establish the operating 
principles, including an initial recognition 
of the priority, as benefic aries, of "those peo-
ple actually cultivating"; the intent to af-
fect, without any limit: ;1011 by way of re-
tained acreage, "lands which are not directly 
cultivated by landowner .''; the resolution to 
" (e) liminate tenancy" a hich, like the actual-
cultivator arid zero-ratan don principles, un-
derlines the universal application of the pro-
gram to both secure and insecure areas; the 
principle of "distributioe free of charge" and 
that of "fair compensation" to landlords: 
and the inclusion of "communal ricelands" 
further underlining the universality of the 
distribution. 
Article 3 confirms that not only "riceland" 
but also "secondary cropland" will be af-
fected. The exclusions i Article 5 make it 
clear that this means Si. lastantially all land 
not used for industrial crops or orchards. 
Again, .Article 3 underlie es that both public 
and private lands are affected. 
Article 4 takes care of some of the admin-
istrative problems experienced under the 
Diem law, notably by requiring that a trans-
fer to be given effect mite) be regstered (not 
just dated in the parties.' own documenta-
tion) "prior to the promulgation date of this 
law." This becomes mosl important in con-
junction with the exclusion from the law. 
in Article 5, of up to 5 hectares per family 
of "ancestral worship lar d." While there is 
some ambiguity, the intent of the drafters 
was pretty clearly to excl ode front considera-
tion any "ancestral worselp" land not regis-
tered as such, prior to Match 26, 1970. Other-
wise, a vast administrative snarl would open 
up as landlords pushed fraudulent claims for 
exemption of five hectares. (Paced with such 
a snarl under the 15 hectare "ancestor wor-
ship" lands exemption le Diem's; Ordinance 
57, which did not require a previously reg-
istered claim, the administrators ultimately 
decided that all claims would be allowed 
across-the-board, effectieely increasing the 
100 hectare retention limit to 115 hectares.) 
The other significant exemptions of Ar-
ticle 5 are lands "presently directly culti-
vated by landowners- (and under the occu-
pancy-freeze decree, there should have been 
no change in who "presently" cultivates since 
April 1959), up to a maxi. num of 15 hectares, 
and religious-organization-owned lands, a 
minor concession economically but a major 
one in Thieu's effort to set the Vietnamese 
senate to approve the bill. 
Article 6 sets the prim plc that changes in 
use will not suffice to invoke the Article 5 
exemptions. 
Article's 7 through 11 establish the prin-
ciples of landlord compensation, basic pro-
vision to be for compensation at 2],e times 
the annual paddy yield, paid 2C% in cash 
and aoe in bonds matuang over eight years 
and bearing 10% interest. (In the legislatve 
process the bonds were deprived of an infla-
tion-proofing feature, bet given a higher 
interest rate.) Bonds are transferrable, but 
will probably be sharply discounted at least 
until significant U.S. f .11tdIng s appori hs

the future, if at all?that all tracts are in 
fact less than the limits: To use such a sim-
plifying presumption is well within the para-
meters for administering Vietnamese land 
laws, and use of the presumption or some-
thing like it is essential to the overriding 
purpose of the legislation. It appears that 
something close to this will in fact be done. 
Article 1.3 nnderlines that the "present 
tiller" is number one in order of priority. 
There may be occasional departures from 
this at village level, but any departures that 
were sure to happen probably happened at 
soon as a given village was administratively 
reoccupied by daylight, and the guidelines 
from Saigon should be firm on the legisla-
tive standard, (Incidentally, it is the gen-
eral consensus that there are very lew sol-
diers who have been totally separEited from 
their former lands. Most already occupy land 
through proxies in the immediate family, so 
that someone already is on the land to make 
their claim under the "present tiller" cate-
gory) 
Article 14 cuts off all taxes on the recipi-
ents, including property tax during the first 
year. The purpose of this was to give the 
new owners the siMplest possible message: 
you don't pay anything to anybody. 
Article 15 tracks other nations' land-re-
form laws in providing for direct cultiva-
tion and a bap on transfer (for 15 years) by 
the new owners. Article 16 confirms exist-
ing decrees in ending payment on former 
French and Ordinance 57 lands. 
Articles /7 th,rough 20 set a credible scale 
of penalties, including fines up to 200,000 
piastres for landlords' efforts to interfere 
with implementation, and a special penalty 
of expropriation wholly withont compensa-
tion for any landlord who makes a false 
claim of self-cultivation to attempt to in-
voke Article S. . ? 
? Article 21 provides broad power to regulate 
implementation by decree, and Artica 22 
cancels all contrary provisions of law. 
After concluding this analysis of the 
"Land to the Tiller" program, Professor 
Prosterrnan noted: 
Considering the pressures against a viable 
bill which came from many quarters in the 
legislature (including both the landlord:. 
related interests and politicians who feared 
the program would give too broad a base 
of popular support to President Thieu), the 
result is a remarkable tribute to Thieu's 
persistence and to the strength of his recog-
nition of just how important this program 
can be to the survival of a non-communist 
Vietnamese government. 
The bipartisan group in the Senate 
that has urged greater American assist-
ance for this program shares a similar 
recognition of just how important this 
program cari-be. Flexibility will be pro-
vided both to our Government and to 
the South Vietnamese in settling upon 
an effective payment mechanism. 
The details of the payment mechanism 
will be discussed at a later date. The aim 
of my remarks in this section has been 
to demonstrate that, whatever our views 
of the present government in Saigon', 
land reform is a worthwhile program 
that American assistance can make pos-
sible--and the price of that assistance is 
almost insignificant in comparison with 
the price of continued combat. Land re-
form is obviously in the best interests of 
the peasantry of South Vietnam, regard-
less of the fate Of the South Vietnamese 
government. Land reform is also in the 
best interest of the United States, Which 
seeks to end its involvement in South 
Vietnam and at the same tirne provide 
for some small measure Of stability in 
that war-torn nation following the de-
parture of American troops. 
V. WILL LAND REFORM IN SOUTH VIETNAM 
PROLONG AMERICAN TROOP INVOLVEMENT? 
It is entirely conceivable that some-
one who understands the importance of 
land reform in modernizing countries, 
and who recognizes the potential for land 
reform in South Vietnam, still might 
oppose American assistance to implement 
this plan. Such a position is commonly 
advanced by those who fear that land 
reform in South Vietnam will prolong 
American involvement there and delay 
the date when all American troops can 
be brought home safely. 
Let me state flatly that if I believed 
land reform would in fact prolong or 
deepen our involvement in Vietnam, I 
would oppose it. I would like to see all 
of our men home as quickly as possible. 
The facts simply do not bear out the 
contention that land reform will cause 
any delay in American troop withdrawal, 
however, even under the terms of the 
most ambitious plans. 
The land in South Vietnam can be 
given to the peasantry before next sum-
mer, and in fact should be carried out 
by this winter for maximum effective-
ness. Admittedly, registration of the 
lands given to the peasants will take a 
bit longer, but neither this nor the trans-
fer of the land to the peasants requires 
the presence of American troops. Not 
only would successful implementation of 
this plan not delay the departure of 
American troops, but it could cut our 
casualties from land mines and booby-
trops, and even reduce dramatically the 
recruitment ability of the troops wepave 
been fighting. The Vietcong obviously 
fear this, and they have undertaken a 
major campaign to try to persuade the 
expectant villagers that tht, land reform 
plan will not be carried out as promised. 
There are several reasons why the 
land reform program will not delay our 
withdrawal. 
First, American troops will not be 
needed in order to implement it?this 
can be performed by Saigon officials in 
conqert with the USAID mission in 
Saigon. 
Second, the upcoming harvest season 
is from December to March. It is during 
this period that the peasants, who now 
anticipate receiving their land from the 
government, should have their desires 
realized. American financial assistance 
on the order of $100 million?to be paid 
only as the program is implemented, and 
not all at once?can make possible suc-
cessful land reform for the majority of 
peasants within areas of ARVN and 
American control. 
Third, the result of these reforms 
should be a reduction in the Vietcong 
recraitment rate, and a corollary in-
Create in the support and loyalty that 
ARVN troops can command in the coun-
tryside. Reform is essential if the Viet-
namese are ever really to bear the bur-
den of maintaining the independence 
and stability of their own nation. 
Fourth, as I mentioned earlier, more 
than half our casualties since the spring 
of 1968 have come from such essen-
tially local activities as the placement of 
mines and booby traps. Land reform, by 
winning the support of the peasants, will 
cut down on peasant participation in 
such activities and increase ARVN and 
American knowledge of where traps 
have been laid; this will reduce the 
deaths and maimings that such traps 
have produced in tragic numbers. 
For all of these reasons, then, those 
who want to increase dramatically the 
rate of American troop withdrawal?and 
I am one?will find that land reform is in 
concert with this objective. Those who 
favor a more gradual timetable will find 
that land reform improves the "Vietna-
mization" program and leads to reduced 
American casualties. Land reform, then, 
is one program that everyone can agree 
upon, if we discard the fears and miscon-
ceptions that surround this vital pro-
gram. 
VI. IS LAND REFORM "IMPERIALISTIC"? 
It seems appropriate to close by look-
ing at land reform from the perspective 
of American foreign policy as a whole. 
Our young people today, and many mil-
lions of their elders, are justly concerned 
about America "imposing" her will and 
her ideas about "democracy" on the peo-
ples of the world. These critics have 
argued?none more ardently than the 
Senator from Arkansas (Mr. FULBRIGHT) 
in his book?that America should not 
seek to make over the rest of the world 
in her own image. From this general 
position, many specific criticisms of our 
actions in Vietnam may be drawn. 
To this I can only respond that I am 
no great admirer of the 'Thieu-Ky gov-
ernment or its domestic policies?I have 
recently written President Thieu to ex-
press my strong objections to the "tiger 
cages" of Con Son Island and other vio-
lations of personal and political liberty. 
Yet land reform is ,not ,meant primarily 
to benefit Thieu and Ky?it is meant to 
benefit the peasantry of South Vietnam, 
the people on whose behalf we undertook 
this costly war. 
These people make up 60 percent of 
the population of South Vietnam, and 
they want land reform. The landlords 
are willing to accept land reform under 
the conditions of the "land to the tiller" 
program. Even the enemies of the Gov-
ernment have promised land reform, 
although we have ample reason to believe 
the promise is a deceitful one. 
In short, land reform is truly desired 
by the people of South Vietnam?there 
can be no doubt about that?and in help-
ing to implement land reform, the United 
States is not "imposing" any unwanted 
social reform on the people of South Viet-
nam. To help a nation fulfill domestic 
policies demonstrably favored by vir-
tually all elements of that nation's pop-
ulation is not imperialistic, but rather a 
responsible form of international assist-
ance. 
I will go one step further and suggest 
that helping implement land reform is 
the type of activity that the United States 
should engage in throughout the world. 
We cannot and should not be the "world's 
policeman," but we can and we must 
be a constructive force in the world com-
munity of nations. Every student of the 
developing nations knows that they will 
not develop without substantial assist-
ance from the industrialized nations. The

August 21, 1970 
leaders of the developing nations recog-
nize this, too. The issue America faces 
in the latter portion of this century is 
not whether we should have a role in 
international affairs, but rather what 
form that role should take. 
In the past, the major "assistance" the 
United States has provided has come in 
the form of warfare and military aid. If 
the tragedy of Vietnam has taught us 
anything?and I pray that it has?at is 
that an over-reliance on military "solu-
tions" is an inadequate substitute for 
aiding a nation in making the economic, 
social, and political reforms that will 
enable it to make the transition to mod-
ernity. This transition may not be peace - 
ful?although we can always work and 
hope for peaceful change. But the tran-
sition may not take place at all, either 
peacefully or with localized disruption, 
if the United States and the other in-
dustrialized nations abdicate the role of 
cooperative assistance. 
The United States must not react to 
the Vietnam morass by abandoning its 
efforts to be of assistance to the nations 
of the Third World. We cannot remain 
aloof from the problems, the deprivation, 
or the aspirations of these people. Our 
foreign policy must attempt to find non-
military means to assist these nations, 
preferably in concert With other mem-
bers of the international community. By 
looking ahead, by dealing with the causes 
of violence rather than the symptoms, we 
can make our foreign policy more re-
sponsible. Land reform?not alone in 
South Vietnam, but in Latin America 
and elsewhere in the Third World?can 
be a useful, appropriate, relatively inex-
pensive, and nondestructive method of 
assisting the modernizing nations. 
Finally, a7nd most importantly, unlesa 
we broaden our conception of foreign 
policy to include land reform, we may 
risk more Vietnams in the years to come. 
The consequences of such continued ig-
norance and intransigence Will therefore 
be the same as the consequences, both 
international and domestic, of this hate-
ful war. Our Nation, and the nations of 
the world, cannot afford such a perilous 
future. The first step toward avoiding 
other Vietnams, belated as this step may 
be, is land reform in South Vietnam. I 
earnestly hope that the Senate will recog-
nize this fact, and act swiftly to make 
the 'land to the tiller" program a suc-
cess. 
Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I 
support the statement of the distin-
guished senior Senator from Washing-
ton (Mr. Maorensort) concerning land re-
form in South Vietnam. 
I am a strong support of the South 
Vietnamese land of the tiller program. 
For the past decade and a half, a nuns-
bar of Americans, beginning with the late 
President Eisenhower, have spoken of the 
need for such a program. 
The land of the tiller program is de-
signed to transfer the ownership of an-
proximately 21/2 to 3 million acres of land 
to some 1 million tenant and refugee 
families. I am convinced that this will 
give the tenant farmers?who comprise 
one-third of the total population of 
South Vietnam?a lasting stake in their 
Government. 
But this program must be speedily im-
plemented. By giving the peasants a 
stake in the preservation of their coun-
try, rapid implementation of land re-
form offers the possibility of a significant 
shift in peasant allegiance toward the 
Central Government. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD an 
article I wrote last year for the Ripon 
Society Forum, outlining the urgent need 
for land reform not only in South Viet-
nam, but in other quarters of the world. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
LAND REFORM: THE PEACEFUL REVOLUTION 
Over the past 60 years, four great civil 
wars have erupted and claimed over a mil-
lion lives apiece?in Mexico, beginning in 
1910; in Russia, starting in 1917; in China, 
beginning in the 1920's; and in Vietnam 
starting in 1945?with an even more virulent 
phase beginning about 1960. Each of there 
PM essentially a peasant revolt. 
The Mexican Revolution Was reformist but 
Largely nonideological, and it created one of 
Latin America's most politically stable and 
economically progressive regimes. The other 
three uprisings occurred under Communist 
banners, and brought into play successively 
greater degrees of American involvement?
culminating in the tragedy of Vietnam, 
which has thus far cost nearly 40,000 Ameri-
can lives and more than 100 billion Ameri-
can dollars. 
But for all our knowledge about thee() 
peasant revolutions, we have not fully under-
stood what has happened and why. And I fear 
that until we do, we are doomed to repeat 
our Vietnam experience again and again. 
RITRAL REVOLT 
Let us first be sure that we understand the 
largely agrarian nature of. these revolutions: 
Mexico, in 1910, was two-thirds rural, 
with 95 percent of its rural population liv-
ing as landless peons or as sharecroppers. 
The spark of revolution came after the In-
dians' last remaining lands had been seized 
by speculators, when a presidential eondl - 
date offered to give back the land. Zapata 
accepted the offer. 
Russia, in 1917, was 80 percent rural. 
Roughly three out of every five rural families 
were landless. And, though Karl Marx had 
written in the Communist Manifesto of the 
"idiocy of rural life," one of Lenin's.two great 
decrees in the first week of the October 
Revolution vested immediate ownership of 
all land in those who actually tilled it. With-
out the peasants' support of the revolution 
the ensuing civil war would have had a dif-
ferent result. 
China, beginning in 1927, was the scene 
of Mao's explicit break with the Marxist con-
cept of revolution based on the urban in-
dustrial proletariat, and of his effort to 
fashion a peasdnt revolt. With an 80 percent 
rural population, three-quarters of which 
VMS landless, China was ripe for revolution. 
Chiang Kai-shek's efforts to fight Mao's land 
reform with military hardware lost a nation 
of half a billion people in two decades. 
Vietnam, from 1945 on, saw an application 
of much the same tactics that had suc-
ceeded in China. In the Viet Minh stage, the 
promise of land-to-the-tiller was effectively 
tied to a nationalist revolution. Here again, 
80 percent of the population was rural, and 
the bulk of that segment was substantially 
landless (tenant farming accounted for 
around 50 percent in the central and north-
ern reaches, and for nearly 75 percent in the 
populous Mekong Delta). The prognosis for 
revolution was again excellent. 
A DOZEN VIETNAMS 
Today there are dozens of Mexices and 
Russias and Chinas and Vietnams in the 
making. Three-fifths of the tote : population 
of the developing nations is neral, and a 
staggering percentage of these people are 
landless laborers or tenteit farmers. In places 
like Vietnam, these fanners may pay one-
third to one-half of their tiny crop in rent 
every year to an absentee landlord. In re-
turn, they are granted no security or tenure 
whatever. Or, if their situation is like that 
of laborers on Latin American plantations, 
they may make $15.00 e month to feed toad 
clothe a whole family. 
These discontened p-Asants are search-
ing for a better life---art I wearever the Com-
munists offer it, they ru -h to the Communist 
banner. 
A paradox arises, however, when one con-
siders further our four great revolutions. The 
Mexicans kept their promise; they redistri-
buted half the crop latel in the country. so 
that 75 percent of the mini families now own 
their MD land. The pleased peasants not 
only have refrained faun overthrowing a 
Mexican government ter half a century, 
but they have also mo: i than tripled their 
agricultural production ti ace the 1930's; and 
their higher incomes hove fueled the growth 
of urban industry to su, ply consumer goods 
and agricultural inputs A similar promise 
was made and kept in Bolivia?with less 
bloodshed--and made and kept without any 
revolution at all in eapan, Taiwan (ten 
years too late), South Korea, and Iran. Such 
a promise has recently been made in Peru. 
tINKEPT PLCMISES 
But the Russians, Chinese, and North 
Vietnamese didn't keep their promises; once 
the revolution had succeeded, they launched 
into e second stage of -land reform," which 
involved the collectivization of holdings 
under the state as a kind of sut er-landlord. 
The Russian "land refor 0" killed or deported 
millions; the Chinese keled 800,000 or more; 
the No, Vietnamese, 50 000 to 100,000. This 
was the "land reform" path also followed by 
the Cubans. 
And the peasants' unhappiness with the 
arrangements in these ceuntries could be de-
tected in their drastic: ny reduced produc-
tivity. Russia took until 1853 to return to its 
1928 (pre-collectivization) level of agricul-
tural production. China is about even now. 
Taiwan. by contrast, has doubled its rice 
production since the land-to-- the-family-
farmer reform has began. Cuba is still be-
hind the pre-Castro lev:d. 
Thus, we have a re-her strange set of 
facts: 
1. Mexico, Japan and .yther countries have 
carried out massive land reform basically on 
the family-farm patter o and have reaped 
the twin benefits of long-term political sta-
bility and a sustained increase in production. 
2. Russia, North Vietnam, and other coun-
tries that have rutlalea colleetivized the 
land have secured a can sistently miserable 
production record from I heir sullen peasants. 
3. Nonetheless, those nho call themselves 
Communists have been able in much of the 
developing world?including Vietnam and 
Latin America?to hold themselves out as 
the genuine agrarian relorrners. 
AN ArrECTIVE ALTERNATIVE 
The problem, it seems to me, is that the 
United States has not effectively offered an 
alternative; and until we do, we will be 
faced with a continuous series of Vietnam-
type .crises built on peasant unrest around 
the world. 
Our alternative is land reform?broad land 
reform., with fair compensation to the land-
owners, that gives the great mass of peasants 
a stake in their society and an incentive to 
produce. Land reform eradicates the key 
appeal that has been used in starting "wars 
of national liberation"; and it can "revoIu-
tion-prodf" the developing world against 
such enticements, as it has most notably 
clone for the Bolivian peasant against the 
call of Che Guevara and for the South Ko-

rean peasant against the efforts of the North 
to start a behind-the-lines "people's war." 
There is,no sounder, higher-priority use of 
our foreign aid dollar than in the reform of 
land tenure. We must think in terms of four 
related ideas Ili order to use that land re-
form dollar most effectively and with maxi-
Minn leverage: 
1. Information. We are woefully short of 
detailed data on the land-reform problem 
arOlinti the world. Too many political officers 
In overseas embassies send back their assess-
ments of rural unrest based on what they 
have heard at English-speaking, urban cock-
tail parties?instead of on what they have 
observed while bounding along back roads 
in a Jeep. 
In Latin America, a preliminary assess-
ment based on non-government scholarship 
indicates that countries on the "critical list," 
as prime candidates for peasant-based re-
volutions over the next decade or so, include 
Brazil, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Most of Cen-
tral ,America. In Asia, the list includes the 
Philippines, Indochina, India, Pakistan, and 
Nepal. Systematic gathering of comparative 
data on tenancy, agricultural labor, land 
Values, credit needs, and related matters in 
these and other developing countries should 
be initiated at once. 
2. Compensation. In most nations, politi-
cally viable, non-revolutionary land reform 
programs must first assuage the landlords' 
doubts that the bonds ,they receive for their 
propertIr will ever be paid off. To resolve 
these doubts, a central element in our land-
reform strategy should be the creation of a 
multilateral agency to acts as guarantor of 
land reform bonds issued by individual 
Countries. Under such a plan, the U.S. could 
pledge one dollar to the capital of such an 
agency for every dollar (or two dollars) put 
up by other developed countries and for 
corresponding, though lesser, amounts Put 
up by the -developing nation. 
NORTILEAS'T BRAZIL 
Brazil, for example, 'badly needs a land 
reform program in its teeming Northeast, 
where 70 percent of the 30 million popula-
tion is rural and 70 percent of that element 
is landless. ACCOITling to a preliminary esti-
mate, it would cost about $1 billion to carry 
Out such a program over a period of seven 
to ten years. If the Brazilians wanted help?
and most of the nations in Brazil's position 
are desperate to find a way out consistent 
with. not bringing their governments crash-
ing down?they would enter into an agree-
ment Isrith the insuring fund. For an ap-
proved Plan (one giving the bulk of its bene-
fits 10 the landless tenant and plantation 
worker), the fund would guarantee the prin-
cipal and interest of the land reform bonds 
to be issued. 
The chief source of bond retirement would 
be a sinking fund established under agreed-
upon rules, into which the peasants would 
make payments for their land over a period 
of perhaps 15 years. Meanwhile, the original 
landowners would know that the interna-
tional community stood behind the bonds 
(which, however, they would be allowed and 
encouraged to transform into needed non-
inflationary capital goods from the start). 
Very preliminary calculations suggest that 
$1 billion of land reform in Brazil could be 
bought at a net outlay by the U.S.--through 
the international fund?of only $100 to $200 
, For the above-named "critical" 
coWitries as a group, preliminary data sug-
gest tht land' reform with a gross cost of 
some $6 to $8 billion would likely ""revolu-
tion-proof" most of the developing world for 
the next couple of decades, and that the net 
cost to the U.S.?through the fund?would 
probably be less than $2 billion, or what it 
costs us to fight in Vietnam for a month. 
3, Credit. The fund, should also be a ve-
hicle for credit and supporting services to 
the smallest farmers. Too much U.S. agri-
culture credit assistance?including that for 
the "miracle" rice and wheat programs?ap-
pears to be going to the solid, traditionally 
creditworthy farmer, and not to be benefiting 
the masses of rural poor in any way. (Even 
if more rice is produced, they still can't af-
ford to buy it.) Credit might be generated 
partly by fund guarantees to commercial 
banks, and partly by direct establishment of 
a revolving fund to be replenished by pea-
sant repayments. For the "critical" coun-
tries, this package of supporting services 
might come to a further $3 to $4 billion with 
a net U.S. outlay of less than $1 billion. 
4. Bilateral aid. In a few spots, notably 
Vietnam, our support for land reform will 
have to be quick and bilateral. The failure 
to carry out land reform sooner is perhaps 
the greatest tragedy of the whole Vietnam 
involvement. Fortunately, the Vietnamese at 
least seem to be moving strongly on a radi-
cally simplified, sweeping land reform pro-
gram, with a total cost of $400 to $500 mil-
lion (no peasant repayment, since we are 
conapzting with a purportedly "free" Viet 
Cong program). The U.S. should bear as 
much of this as needed?the whole amount 
is a week's cost of the war?to keep the pro-
gram moving fast. 
AVOIDING NEW TRAGEDIES 
In certain proximate countries, like Pan-
ama or the Dominican Republic, a few tens 
of millions for land reform now may help 
avOld tragedy in the 1970's; and strategic 
considerations may suggest immediate bi-
lateral assistance. 
In summary, with the right priorities and 
with imaginative programs, and at a total 
cost of perhaps $3 billion spread over a de-
cade or more, the U.S. can become the 
"champion" of land reform; help bring about 
markedly increased political stability in the 
developing world; and help motivate a 
marked increase in agricultural production. 
For a tiny fraction of what it has cost us 
in Vietnam, the United States can buy in-
surance against future Vietnams, and can 
bring a higher standard of living and a more 
meaningful existence to millions of people 
whose lives are now more reminiscent of the 
Middle Ages than the 20th Century. 
Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that there be printed 
in the RECORD a statement prepared by 
the Senator from Maine (Mr. MusmE) 
and the article entitled, "Real Land Re-
form Comes to Vietnam," as requested 
by Senator MusKiE. 
There being no objection, the State-
ment and article were ordered to be 
printed in the RECORD, as follows: 
REAL LAND REFORM COMES TO VIETNAM 
Mr. MUSKIE. Mr. President, during the past 
year I have spoken several times on the 
great importance of United States support 
for a comprehensive program of land reform 
in South Vietnam. I join today with Sena-
tors Magnuson and Packwood in reempha-
sizing the broad implications which such a 
program can have for termination of the 
conflict in Vietnam. 
It is clear that whatever policy the United 
States pursues in disengaging from this 
war, an increasing burden and responsi-
bility must fall upon the South Vietnamese 
themselves. It is also clear that this respon-
sibility must include broadening the base of 
support for the central government, whoever 
may be at the head of that government. 
The fighting and killing in Vietnam can 
never be brought to an end without a politi-
cal settlement of some sort. That settlement 
'mist necessarily be based on winning the 
support of the Vietnamese peasant, Who 
today has little stake in the future of his 
country. 
A successful land reform program offers 
a unique possibility for winning this sup-
port. It could provide the incentive neces-
sary to stabilize the political situation in 
South Vietnam, As Senator Magnuson and 
Senator Packwood have pointed out in their 
remarks, the promise of land tenure has been 
a key weapon in revolutionary movements 
during this century. Vietnam is no excep-
tion. 
In the August 9 edition of the Baltimore 
Sun there was an article on land reform by 
Professor Roy Prosterman, who has been 
very influential in the development of the 
land to the Tiller Bill signed into law in 
March, 1970, by President Thieu. Professor 
Prosterman has provided a thoughtful and 
concise analysis of the historical background 
leading up the present program of land re-
form, which President Thieu initiated. In 
commenting on the significance of this pro-
gram and the failure of the Diem regime to 
carry out land reform in the 1950's, Professor 
Prosterman states that, "indeed, if the Com-
munists had been deprived of their chief 
selling pont in the South Vietnamese coun-
tryside through effective land reform, it is 
probably true that there never would have 
been a war." 
Turning to the possible impact of a suc-
cessful land reform effort, Professor Proster-
man further states that for the first time, 
Saigon has the opportunity to "come to grips 
with the focal issue in the countryside, the 
one that has supplied the chief Viet Cong 
appeal to the peasantry." 
I urge my colleagues to consider the argu-
ments presented in this article. Land reform 
In Vietnam is long overdue. The United 
States must provide its full encouragement 
and support for implementation of this pro-
gram as rapidly tie possible, if the impact of 
land reform is to be fully realized. 
REAL LAND REFORM COMES TO VIETNAM 
(fly Roy L. Prosterman) 
An editorial in a major daily in late March 
called the new South Vietnamese land reform 
law "the most important news to come out 
of Vietnam since the end of the Japanese 
occupation." They may not have exaggerated. 
Lack of landownership among the peasan-
try formed a basic part of the Communist ap-
peal in Russia, China and Cuba, so it should 
be no surprise that it has performed a paral-
lel function in Vietnam in the hands both 
of the Viet Minh and the Viet Cong. 
Tenant farming is the biggest occupation 
in South Vietnam, with close to a million 
Vietnamese families, or about 6 million peo-
ple in a population of 17 million, dependent 
on it. The Mekong Delta, where about 70 per 
cent of the farm families are primarily de-
pendent on farming tenanted land, has one 
of the highest proportions of tenant farmers 
in the world. The typical delta family lives 
on 31/2 acres, pays a third of its crop to the 
landlord (who supplies no inputs of any de-
scription), rarely has any surplus beyond its 
immediate nutritional needs, is evictable at 
will and is held for the rent even in the case 
of crop failure. In Central Vietnam, the 
typical tract is 2 acres and the rent averages 
half the crop. 
For years the Viet Minh and then the Viet 
Cong were allowed to hold themselves out to 
these people as land reformers, who would 
drive away their landlords and give them 
their land while the successive Saigon gov-
ernments were identified as pro-landlord. 
DIEM'S DISASTBR 
In retrospect, the most disastrous of all Ngo 
Dinh Diem's policies in the late 1950's was 
probably that which promoted return to the 
landlords of the extensive lands purportedly 
distributed by the Viet Minh to the peasantry 
in the 1945-1954 period and reassertion of 
the landlords traditional 'rights over their 
former tenants. The promotion of this worse-
than-useless program?with the co-operation 
of American advisers who were unwilling to 
push for the major land reform that our top

Aug itst 21, 1970 
policy-makers wanted?was surely one of the 
me-eminent disasters of postwar American 
foreign aid. 
Diem's failure to act was doubly tragic be-
cause the Communists in the North were car-
rying out their usual second-stage land re-
form?collectivization, as in Russia, China 
and later Cuba?which defeated most of the 
expectations that had lead, peasants to sup-
port the revolution. As elsewhere, collectivi-
zation was violent, unpopular and disastrous 
for production. 
Diem might have looked, as an alternative 
for the South, toward any of the massive 
democratic land reforms that had already 
been carried out in the Twentieth Century in 
Mexico, Bolivia, Japan, South Korea and 
Taiwan. But Diem failed to profit by example. 
He stood with the landlords and we stood 
with Diem and as we moved into the 1960's 
the revived Communist movement was once 
more offering land to a population whose en-
tire security and livelihood were bound up 
with their relation to the soil. 
Little wonder that the common recruiting 
appeal in wide areas where Viet Cong land 
reform was in effect was "the movement has 
given you land, give us your son," as it was 
put by Marine Lt, Col. William Corson in 
"The Betrayal," 
Or that the late Bernard Fall called land 
reform "as essential to success as ammuni-
tion for howitzers?in fact, more so." 
Or that Douglas Pike, probably our leading 
authority on the Vies Cong, describes their 
indoctrination system as "based on vested 
interests in land." 
Or that field interviewers in a 1967 Stan-
ford Research Institute study found that 
Vietnamese tenant farmers named landown-
ership five times as frequently as physical 
security as a thing of crucial concern to 
them. 
Of that over half of those bearing arms 
against us in Vietnam, main foree and guer-
rilla units taken together, are still today 
native South Vietnamese. 
Or that over half of all American casual-
ties in the last two years have been due to 
such essentially local guerrilla activities as 
planting mines and booby traps--the vil-
lagers then standing silent as we walk into 
them. 
Or that virtually no main force activi-
ties could take place without the essential 
advance work done by the local villagers in 
carrying in and burying supplies and am-
munition at intervals along the line of 
march toward the military objective. 
Indeed, if the Communists had been de-
prived of their chief selling point in the 
South Vietnamese countryside through ef-
fective land reform, it is probably true that 
there never would have been a war. Presi-
dent Nguyen Van Thieu himself made sub-
stantially that observation in a epeach given 
January 18, 1968. 
The failure from 1955 well into 19613 to 
come to grips with this problem is so com-
plete and so numbing that one must mental-
ly prepare to receive the pleasont shock of 
the facts from recent months. 
Now, at long last, the South Vietnamese 
government, under strong pressure from 
President Thieu and with newly firm Amer-
ican support, is preparing to offer the peas-
ants as much as the Viet Cong have seemed 
to offer. Much more, in fact, for the Saigon 
land reform program is not meant to be 
renewed by collectivization. Since coming 
to grips with the fundamental need for land 
reform in early 1968, President Thieu has 
successfully pushed through five critical land 
reform measures: 
FIVE MEASURES 
I. At the end of 1968, he ended the in-
credible, self-defeating practice by which 
landlords had been returning to reassert 
their "rights" to land, often riding into 
newly secured villages in South Vietnamese 
Army jeeps, 
? 
2. In April, 1969, he put a freeze on all 
rights to land. occupancy, pending passage 
of new land reform legislation. Preliminary 
field observations have indicated this freeze 
to be well-publicized and quite effective. 
3. In June, 1069, he began an accelerated 
d,stribution of government-owned lands free 
of charge. Since then, over 300,000 acres have 
been distributed to the benefit of nearly 
100,000 former tenant-farmer families. 
4. In July,' 1969, he presented the land-to-
the-tiller bill to the National Assembly. 
After a desperate fight against landlord in-
terests and political opponents, the bill was 
passed in March. This measure, which the 
New York Times has editorially called "prob-
ably the most ambitious and progressive non-
Communist land reform of the Twentieth 
Century," is the keystone of Mr. Thieu's ef-
forts. It embodies a drastically simplified 
program which will distribute virtually all 
tenanted land in the country to the present 
tillers free of charge and with fair payment 
by the government to the landlords. Owner-
ship of over half the cultivated land in the 
country will change hands and a million 
tenant-farmer families?a third of the na-
tion's population?will become full owners. 
The total price tag of about $400 million 
it equivalent to around five days' cost of the 
war. U.S. support?in the form of productive 
commodities to generate piasters?for some-
where between a quarter and a half this 
amount will be asked from Congress in the 
coming months and it is to my mind un-
doubtedly the biggest bargain of the Viet-
nam War; preliminary measures have already 
been introduced in both houses with ex-
tremely broad bipartisan support. 
5. Last June, he further simplified the pro-
gram's administration by decreeing an im-
mediate end to all rents without formalities, 
!each as Western-style land titles. 
A number of factors have combined with 
the program's enormous simplicity and the 
major results already achieved to give even 
tee most jaded observers real hope that this 
package of measures will be largely effective 
by the next main harvest from December 
through February. 
EXCELLENT PROSPECTS 
There are excellent prospects that the great 
majority of South Vietnam's million tenant-
farmer families will be free of rents they 
would otherwise pay and will regard them-
selves at definitely on the road to full owner-
ship under policies sponsored by Saigon. 
Those living in Viet Cong-controlled areas 
will consider themselves definitely freed from 
the prospect that Saigon's control means the 
landlords' return and confirmed in possession 
of the land they are tilling. 
If Saigon can carry it off, what conse-
quences can be expected? There would appear 
to be several, each of potentially far-reaching 
importance: 
For the first time, Saigon will have suc-
cessfully come to grips with the focal issue 
in the countryside, the one that has supplied 
the chief Viet Cong appeal to the peasantry. 
A significant spectrum shift in allegiance 
among Vietnam's 6 million tenant-farmer 
people can be expected in Saigon's direction. 
This shift will have not only a political 
dimension, but a significant military dimen-
sion. Notably, tenant farmers and sons of 
tenant-farmers, who are the largest rank-
and-file group in the South Vietnamese Army 
and in the local militia, are more likely to be 
motivated to fight if they have a stake in 
their society, which is probably of more fun-
damental irnpOrtance to the success of "Viet-
na.mization" than whether the recruit gets 
an M-16 to replace his M-1. Moreover, peas-
ants who regard Saigon as the source of their 
land-ownership are more likely to take the 
risk of supplying intelligence. At the same 
time, the root of peasant motivation to sup-
port the Viet Gong in a variety of ways will 
he significantly weakened. 
MIGHT HELP PAR CS TALKS 
The prospect of such a massive, grassroots 
shift in peasant support is one of the few 
things that can be visualized which might 
supply enough bargaining leverage to get the 
Paris talks moving again. Indeed, former 
Paris negotiator Cyrus Vence suggested last 
fall that the offer to hold back on imple-
mentation of the land reform in historically 
Viet Gong-controlled areas could become a 
powerful bargaining lever, once the land-to-
the-tiller bill had been pessed. 
Land reform, at last, and tragically late, 
appears to have come to Vietnam. But even 
at this date it is, withoue exaggeration, one 
of the major events of the war,
