on 5 Aprils although marked by less political acrimony than prevailed in 
previous sessions, still took actions only preparatory to real economic 
achievement. The Committee requested the Secretariat, to make several new 
studies, among them trade with Japan and the dollar shortage in the ECAFE 
region? The most important action, however, was the establishment, by an 
'A. to 1 vote with the USSR dissenting, of a Committee on Industry and Trade. 
The new committee will meet annually in the spring and again just before 
thn full SCARS sessions each fall. Initiative leading to this action was 
taken by the Indian delegate, while the US delegation did effective work in 
reconciling differences between the original Indian draft and a UK counter-
draft. The US delegation reports that establishment of this Committee has 
the positive virture of providing a permanent body capable of examining the 
economic aspects of ECAFE's work more or lees free from. political iSRUGG0 
Ambassador Stanton, the US delegate, reports that he considers the 
most positive value of the session to the US was the goodwill engendered 
among Indian and other Asiatic delegations by US support of their strong 
desires to establish the Committee on Industry and Trade and our assistance 
In reconciling conflicting views, in sharp contrast to 
tactics which were resented by Asiatic meMbers. 
Before the Bangkok session began there had been some indication that 
implementation of Point IV would be a primary topic for discussion. The 
other delegations acquiesced, however, to the US desire to hold off any 
ECAFE resolutions on Point IV until ECOSOC acts upon it following submission 
of the Secretary General's study and report, at its July meeting*

rest will be made up of other foodstuffs; raw materials such as tongeten

Since the Korean republic's economy is competitive with that of other 
non-industrial Far Eastern countries, its natural trade orientation is 
necessarily towards industrial Japan, despite strong Korean fears of a 
return to the pre-liberation conditions of Japanese economic domination. 
Jepan, in turn, has a critical need of Korean rice imports. If, as seems 
probable, Korea has no exportable rice surplus in the coming twelve months, 
Japan nevertheless mill have use for the dollars received for exports to 
Korea in order to purchase imports elsewhere. 
Simultaneous with the announcement of the SCAP-ECA trade arreenent. 
the Korean Government has ordered suspension of all barter trade with its 
reeet neighbor tothe north, on. the grounds that northern Korean teeders 
aehed as expionage agents for their Soviet-supported regime. US Oceepation 
officials in southern Korea generally have favored barter trade with the 
north in the past on the grounds that even the small quantities of critical 
materials so received have benefited the Republic's economy sufficiently 
to overshadow other considerations. It appears that the Korean Government 
now believes such critioal items can be procured elsewhere with ECA-
supplied funds0 
Members of the UK Commission on Korea (UNCOK), in contract, haee 
advocated increased barter with northern Korea as a step towards removal 
of economics barriers now existing along the 38th Parallel, thus implementing 
the UN mission of promoting Korean national solidarity. The Government's 
action in ending barter may, therefore. reinforce the opinion of some UNCOK 
members that President Rhee is not sincere in his stated desire to assist 
them in solving the problem of unification. 
KOREA 
North Korean underground-- Independent underground organizations, having 
TITATIlinia770a-aralther central direction nor lateral liaison, are 
reported to exist in urban areas of northern Korea. In the larger cities, 
group oonmanders have been appointed, recoenition signs learned and weapons

movements, and the informal "ultimatum" sent to Acting President LI 
Tsung-jen. Although LI has assiduously sought a peace settlement, he 
has repeatedly indicated his unwillingness to accept terms tantamount 
to liquidation of remaining Nationalist power. In partial reply to 
the Communist preasure, LI her, sent MAO Tse-tung a dramatic appeal, 
citing the popular demand for peace in all China and offering to 
surrender himself for punishment as a. "war criminal." 
While attempting to saddle the Communists with responsibility for 
the probable break-down of negotiations, We regime meanwhile will 
offer various counter-proposals, seek concessions, and try to prolong 
the discussions as long as possible. There has been a definite trend 
on the part of many Nationalist leaders toward a resigned acceptanee 
of the idea of Coomunist domination; hence a dangerous drift toward 
CCP/USSR orientation. Despite this trend, if the LI-HO regime cona 
eludes an overall surrender agreement with the Chinese Communists, the 
commitments probably will be repudiated by a majority of Nationaliat 
leaders, who will atteApt continued resistence from the South and 
claim that the "recognized" government still functions from Canton, 
Meanwhile the Chinese Coamunists are likely to demand that the 
Nanking Government: (1) accept full responsibility for the civil war; 
(2) repudiate CBIANG Kai-shek end all treaties with the US; (3) transfer 
to a Communist-controlled "coalition" all of its authority as a "National 
Government," together with title to all assets; and (4) formally transfer 
all Nationalist armies to the "coalition" for subsequent "reorganieation." 
Lies aovernment can comply with all or the above demands simply 
by signing an "agreement." Such an "agreement" could not keep the 
Generalissimo from reclaiming his position as "President of the ho-
public," destroy remainini anti-Communist forces, or deliver Nationalist 
armies to the "coalition- But it would greatly weaken the Generelissimole 
claim; it would confirm as "criminals" those refusing to surrender 
Government assets and it would make outlaws of those armies refusing 
to be "reorganized." Thus all of these forces would become in effeot 
the object of a Communist-led "bandit suppression campaign. 
If the Nanking government signs such an agreement, its leaders 
will be removed from the. "war criminal" list and accepted into the 
"coalition." If those leaders refuse to sign?and they will not te 
allowed much more time--the Chinese Communists will resume the offensive. 
Whether in the name or the "coalition" or the Chinese Communist Party 
alone, Communist armies probably will cross the Yangtee within the 
next six weeks. 
Hankow evacuatioaaalans-- As superior Communist forces continue 
their southern push along the Piaghan railroad toward Baakow, the 
Central China. commander FAX Chung-hsi appears to be readying his forces

15 April to allow use of the premises as the advance headquarters for 
the Central China Command. Indications are that PAI's main headquarters 
probably will be moved south to Changsha as the first phase in with-
drawal to his home province of Kwanesi. Almost all of PAI's heave' 
equipment has long since been moved south. The timing for the with-
drawal of his troops is dependant upon the rapidity of Red troop AOVO 
ments toward Hankon. PAI will probably offer only token resistan7e 
in the Hunkow sector, thereby conserving his troops for possible 
inclusion in a southern bloc or an authonomous Kwangsi regime, 
Communists infiltration of  Taiwan-- Increased Communist activity 
in Taiwan is apparent and Taiwanese dissatisfaction with Nationalist 
Osineee rule continues to mount. The Chinese Communist radio recently 
announced the presence of a Taiwanese woman Communist in North China, 
a Hong Kong Communist group has announced its program for Taiwan, 
and the distribution of Communist propaganda on the island has been 
greatly increased. The Conmunistis may also have been active in the 
recent student demonstration in Taipei which led to the detention of 
some twenty students and to the closing of the university, The arrival 
of additional mainland troops may provide the means for further Com-
munist infiltration. Meanwhile; soaring prices,' erowing economic 
instability and Chinese corruption, especially as evidenced by recent 
private transactions in US military equipment, are fanning the flames 
of Taiwanese resentment against Chinese rule and increasing the 
possibility of an uprising. 
Soviet Policy in Manchuria-- Scanty reports coming out of Man-
churia indicate that although USSR covert influence there is powerful, 
the Soviet is operating through the Chinese Communists, and is being 
careful to avoid either jeopardizing the USSR's strong legal rights in 
Manchuria or offending Chinese Communist nationalist sensibilities. 
There are apparently no Soviet troops in Manchuria outside the Kwantung 
Peninsula, with the possible exception of detachments reported to be 
eneaeed in training Chinese Communist forces in Harbin and Chiamaresu. 
There are a number of Soviet railwey guards and advisers employed 
in connection with the Chinese Changchun. Railway--established by the 
August 1945 Sino-Soviet Agreement and consisting of the former Chinese 
Eastern end South Manchuria railways. The USSR, however, is not 
participating in the administration of the Railway, which, under the 
Agreement, was to have been operated jointly by the USSR and the Re-
public of China. For the sake of observing its legal railway cbligations 
to the letter, the USSR will probably not join in the railway administration 
until such time as. the Chinese Communist regime is recognized as the 
Government of China, following which the USSR will be in a strong legal 
position to consolidate its gains in Manchuria, an area that the USSR 
regards as strategically necessary in a future struggle with the West.

land frontier. 
The Chinese Communists have thus far not opposed Soviet expensioniet 
designs on Manchuria. On the contrary, North Shensi radio has broai-
cast a major policy statement, amounting to increased emphasis on a 
satellite foreign policy. The broadcast reaffirmed Chinese Communist 
loyalty to the USSR and endorsed, for the first time, the Sino-Soviet 
Treaty of 1945, and characterized Soviet occupation of Dairen and Port 
Arthur at; "severe blows to imperialist aggression in the Far East and 
far-reaching guarantees of the interests of the Chinese people against

NEWS NOTES 
Nationalist Inflation Perhaps the last spiral in the inflation 
of the gold yuan began this week with the Shanghai market's unfavorable 
reaction to the dumping of 60,000 ounces of gold by the Central JJank 
on April 4. The 100% spurt in prices touched off by the Central Bake 
supposedly deflationary action is apparently a sign that the gold 
yuan will shortly be repudiated by. the Chinese people and that the 
Nanking Government will have lost its last source. of income, the print-
ing press. The Government's April budget called for nearly one trillion 
gold yuan, to be obtained largely by increaeed note iseue, If .deprived 
of this income to support its civil and military functions, the Govern-
ment's last figments of authority will be seriously threatened, 611 
its position at the Peiping peace table. 
Communist Trade-- While there is a definite trend towards revival 
of trade with Communist-held North China, the quantity of this trade 
hanMetd at Tientsin during March was extremely all From 19 February 
to 2$ March, only seven or eight small foreign ships unloaded cargos, 
at Tientsin. The newly-opened Tientsin Customs Administration reported 
that Hong Kona cargos.. the majority, totaled US $18,000 in value, 
This amount is only a fraotion of pre-Communist Tientein imports 
which exceeded US $500,000 monthly in early 1948. 
Land Reform-- One of the few attempts at land reform in North 
China areas of recent Communist occupation was announced rectintia for 
the Tientsin vicinity. This pertinent provisions of the reform 
are that 2 public land shall continue to be rented; "landlords" will 
receive farms "generally equal" to others, but in a number of merle 
may retain their holdings; wealthy middle class farmers" and poorer 
people who till their own land "snail have protection"; no land farmed 
by machines shall be confiscated; and land will be confiscated by and 
become the property of the Tientsin Peoples Government alone. This

cautious program program et most provides for state expropriation and control 
of small amounts of land. The government will not redistribute land 
but instead will rent to "unemployed and poor tenant farmers." The 
purpose of Tientsin land reform is not to erase the inequalities of 
feudalism or to fulfil the promioes of SUN Yat-sen, but to "protect 
and develop agricultural production, in view of the arrival of spring 
cultivation," according to the Communist announcement. 
BURMA 
Karen-Burman'...1kflajLelmed--The Karen "surrender", as announced by 
Th7-51-mese-----Ziovernment, failed to materialize after two days of negotia-
tions and military operations have been resumed against the Karen forces 
at Insein, 10 miles north of Raneoon. This action was taken after the 
Karens ignored strieeent Government peace terms, evidently desiened to 
give the impression that the Karens were repentant and humble. 
Temporary Karen participation in negotiations with the Goverment, 
however, was primarily motivated by the Commonwealth ambassadors endorse-
ment of Thakin Nuts peace-talk invitation. Since the Government had 
taken the initiative in arranging peace discussions, the Karens expected 
to win considerable concessions, particularly in the mati;or of a separate 
Karen state. The Goverment, largely at the inaistance of Supreme 
Commander No Mee demanded instead taut the Karens surrender their arms 
and lersonnel and that Karon army mutineers be treated as any other muti-
neers. Such terms amounted to unconditional surrender and were ob-
viously unacceptable to the Karens who were willing to continue the 
struggle. Finally, when Karen counter-proposals?including a Burma-wide 
truce between Karen and Government forces?were rejected by the Govern-
ment, the Karens apparently felt that further negotiations were useless, 
Although new efforts may be made to mediate the Karen-Burman conflict 
and it appears that Thakin Nu may have been and possibly still in willing 
to explore the possibilities of a peaceful settlement further, no simple 
or lasting solution is to be expected in the near future. The Karens in 
all likelihood will continue their steugele until they obtain an autono-
mous state and are permitted to retain the arms with which to defend 
themselves, or until they suffer severe military reverses,

Dutch vie for Rmill17_oan trog control--A contest for control of

they ask the Siliwangi Division's aid in restoring order in the area 
by neutralizing the fanatical Moslem and pro-Communist armed bands that 
were terrorizing the populace and destroying important installations* 
The Pasundan Government forwarded the Dutch suggestion. There presently 
appears to be a difeerenoe of opinion among the 14 Siliwangi battalions 
of the Division in the vicinityof Bandoena. The Dutch have recently 
claimed that five of the battalions have come over to their side. It 
appears now, however, that only two of the Siliwangi battalions have 
actually turned themselves over to the Dutch, while the loyalty of the 
other throe still ravers. Republican leaders who have been consulted 
are opposed to the idea of cooperation with. the Dutch at the present 
time and. recommend that extremist groups bo eliminated after a.settle-
ment with the Dutch is reached. Inasmuch as the Pasundan Government is 
pro-Republican in sentiment andthe son of its highest official is an 
influential officer in the Siliwangi Division, it is believed that only 
a mall portion of Siliwangi troops will accept the Dutch offer. If 
the Dutch Army carries out its threat to attack Siliwanai units at this 
point, the majority of Siliwangi battalions, ? still loyal to the Republic, 
are capable of carrying out prolonged and intensified guerrilla warfare, 
PHILIPPINES 
NacionalistasWa.s_oth ends--Contrury to Party policy in the Senate, V 
Nacionalista Party members in the Houne of Representatives may lend 
their strength to the Avelino faotion of the Liberal Party Such an 
action would imperil President Quirino's position and give the Naneenal-
istas the same important bargaining position in the House which they now 
hold in the Senate, where Quirino's control is completely dependent upon 
their temporary support. (See BAE Weekly 1146). In the douse, although 
Quirinistas have greater strength than the pro-Avelino Liberals, they 
cannot defeat a possible combination of Avelinistas and Nacionalistasa 
On 5 April, three Nacionalistas and four pro-Avelino Liberale 
filed a resolution in the House to impeach President Quirino on charges 
of extravagance, misappropriation of funds, and abuse of power in. 
abetting graft and corruption. 'Quirino himself asked for ineediate 
action on the resolution. Some political observers believe that this 
move is part of a Hacionalista plan to wreck the Liberal Party, the 
first phase having been the nenate's discrediting of avelino and the 
second to be the house's undermining of the Quirino faction. It in ex-
pected that Quirino's impeachment will be defeated but his prestige will 
decline as the. charges of corruption and dishonesty are publicized. 
throughout the Philiaaines. Tho Nacionalistas can be expected to take 
full advantage of Liberal Party dissension to improve their brightening 
prospects for victory in the fall. elections.
