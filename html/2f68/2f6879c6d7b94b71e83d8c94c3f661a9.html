 PART  I     MAJOR WORLD  PROBLEMS
 1.          General.    The  balance  between the  US  and USSR
 in the tangible elements  of national power,         while  con-
 tinuing to be marked by offsetting assymetries,                                                is
 unlikely to change      fundamentally.   Perceptions of the
 less  tangible  aspects of the balance of power -- national
 attitudes,  will,  the momentum and direction of interna-
 tional                                events -- may change  importantly in either Moscow
 or Washington or elsewhere.  In a situation of  rough
 equality in  intercontinental nuclear forces between the
 US  and USSR,  other national assets will gain  importance
 as  elements of the  "strategic"  balance of power.
 While the Soviet-American relationship will remain
 the most  important  single  factor,  power will continue  to
 diffuse,  both because of the  spread and changes  in   tech-
 nology and because                                   of the  growth of interdependence.   Issues
 not  susceptible to  conventional methods of diplomacy or
 force will grow in   importance.  The  spread of nuclear
 weapons,  the existence  of  the  OPEC cartel,  and to a  lesser
 extent the growing demand for raw materials have made
 coercive power available to additional  states  and non-
 governmental groups  including terrorists.                                            The  United States
 therefore will be  faced not only with a persistent  threat
 to  its  interests  from the USSR,  but also with turbulence
 and challenge   in  its relations with other nations.

 2.   The  USSR.    The United States and the Soviet Union
 will    remain principal  adversaries  during the next  five
 years.   Their  relationship will probably  continue    to be
 marked by     an  absence of armed  conflict  and at  least
 public adherence,  by both governments,  to  the desirability
 of  cooperation   and the need to avoid a reversion to
 cold-war relations.   Disagreements between the two powers
 will  continue  to abound,  however,  in the application of
 this  approach to  specific problems.         There is little
 reason to believe  that the USSR will         accept and act
 on Western views   about the content of a normal,  fruitful
 relationship.
 The  Soviet  leaders  seem convinced that  in the  overall
 "correlation of    forces,"  world events are moving over the
 long run in  favor of the USSR.   They will attempt  to further
 this movement through a variety of political,  economic,
 and subversive activities,  backed with growing military
 capabilities. in doing so,  the   Soviets will be  cautious,
 trying to avoid confrontation with the US  and foreign
 policies  so assertive  as  to jeopardize what  the Soviets
 see  as  favorable trends  in US-USSR relations  and world
 affairs  generally.   They will  also favor the  use  of  state
 power in the  economic,   diplomatic,  and conventional military

 fields  over the  revolutionary approach which,  however,
 will  continue to be  utilized in  favorable  situations..
 The  USSR will  seek to keep  "detente"  as  the  leading
 feature     of  its  foreign policy with the US and Western
 Europe  for at  least the next  five years,  largely  for
 pragmatic  reasons  --  i.e., because they think  it offers
 them more advantages    than  any other alternative to:
 --  reduce the  risk of nuclear confronta-
 tion;
 --  control  local crises which  could lead
 to general war;
 -- minimize China's  chances of developing
 anti-Soviet  combinations with other major
 powers;
 --  obtain Western economic and technological
 assistance;
 -- promote  the  disintegration of US-Allied
 power blocs;  and
 play a superpower role with the  US  with
 respect to world affairs.
 The  Soviets  are not  likely to be  substantially
 restrained by arms  control arrangements,  although  for
 political  imagery they will      not  only espouse  a variety of
 disarmament proposals,  but work       to approve some actual,
 albeit     limited,  agreements.   In  the  field of strategic

 offensive  forces,  the modernization program now underway
 will  give the  Soviets  larger numbers of more accurate missile
 warheads,  improved missile  survivability and greater opera-
 tional  flexibility.   In their  strategic offensive and
 defensive programs,      research and development  is  aimed at
 unique applications of  existing technologies  and applica-
 tions of advanced technology based on theoretical or techno-
 logical                                   breakthroughs.   Given present and planned US
 capabilities,  we believe that the  Soviets     could not
 develop  in the next     five years  a  first-strike  capability
 so  overwhelming as to prevent  substantial retaliation.
 However)  in the  conventional field,  the    Soviets will
 continue to build and modernize  their ground,        naval,
 and air  forces for theater warfare along the periphery
 of  the USSR and for distant  limited operations.   These
 programs will increase  a variety of Soviet capabilities
 and strain the  credibility of  Soviet professions'of
 peaceful  intent.
 The USSR will  continue  to  see  China  as  a  major
 hostile  competitor and will  expend considerable  foreign
 policy support  in a global  struggle with the  Chinese  for

 influence  and  leverage.   At the  same time,  now that Mao
 is  dead,  Moscow will try  to  influence  the Chinese  succession,
 seeking to  identify and strengthen any elements  in the
 leadership  sympathetic  to  less hostile,  more pragmatic
 Sino-Soviet relations.
 In  its economic policy,  Moscow will continue          to give
 high priority to the kinds  of  growth which increase  national
 power and facilitate  its projection abroad.   A new aware-
 ness of the high burden of the  Soviet defense                                   effort,
 however,  raises  important questions about the   relative
 efficiency of,  and structural differences between,  the
 military and civilian  sectors  of the  Soviet economy.
 A better understanding   is     needed of the process  of West
 to East technology   transfer,  particularly the  differen-
 tial  ability of these two                                     sectors to absorb and pro-
 liferate this technology.   Domestically,                                          pressures will
 grow for modernizing reforms    of the  Soviet economic
 system,  particularly its  administrative      structure.   As
 has been the  case  elsewhere  in Eastern Europe  (e.g.,
 Czechoslovakia),  reforms which  seek the managerial bene-
 fits of                                 some type  of         demand system could have implications

 for  liberalizing other areas of  Soviet life,  and will
 accordingly encounter powerful  resistance.    Prolonged
 detente  could threaten to  erode the pervasive authority
 of the Communist Party over the   Soviet populace.   But
 these  are  long-standing and  chronic problems,  and over
 the  next five years  the  regime is quite capable of
 resisting unwanted  changes in the  essentials  of the  So-
 viet domestic  system.
 A key intelligence focus over the next      five years
 will be the Soviet  leadership  succession, as  Brezhnev
 and the  other aging  seniors  leave the political scene
 and their replacements  consolidate power.      Both the new
 leadership's policy modifications and the  relative  smooth-
 ness                                  or turmoil of the succession process will have
 implications  for bilateral relations with the US  and the
 Soviet  stance  abroad generally, as well as    for domestic
 Soviet priorities  and the Party management of the  country.
 While the  odds  heavily favor continuity,  Soviet politics
 are  so centralized -- and  so  secretive  -- that signifi-
 cant  change  under a new leadership cannot be wholly ex-
 cluded.

 3.   The People's Republic of China.   The controversy
 which has  accompanied the  death of Chou En-lai,  and the
 purge  of Teng Hsiao-ping has  demonstrated that the  suc-
 cession will be  contested.   Mao's  death has not altered
 this.   The leadership appears to be  split on  factional
 lines.   Contentious issues have emerged which are not.
 susceptible to early   solutions.   An authoritarian com-
 munist leadership dedicated to  the  creation of a great
 socialist power by the year 2000    is  commonly accepted --
 disagreements                                      are on means  to achieve this and on who will
 run the party and the  state.   Internal  strength and ex-
 ternal security will be China's main preoccupations.
 China will continue to develop its strategic  forces
 gradually,  though it will present an  increasingly   serious
 retaliatory  threat  to the  Soviet Union.   In the  early
 1980s,  it  should have the  capability of striking the
 United States with an  ICBM and possibly an SLBM.     China
 will maintain  large general purpose  forces  capable of
 operations  on its periphery, and the  gap between Chinese
 military might and that of  its neighbors    (other than the
 USSR)  will probably widen.   China will be  unlikely to
 commit its  forces,  however, in  the absence of major
 provocation or concern,   but China will become  increasingly

 concerned about achieving a  solution to the Taiwan problem.
 There  are pressures  in China  to get the US  to end its
 military  involvement with Taiwan and to establish full
 relations with Peking within a shorter time  frame.   At
 the  same time  China will      seek to  combat what  it perceives
 as  encirclement by the USSR.   As       a consequence China will
 face  some hard decisions:
 How to deal with a  continuous  Soviet
 threat while also exerting pressure
 for the neutralization of Taiwan.
 How to reconcile  its  support for a
 belligerent North Korea with its   de-
 sire  for stability                                           in North Asia and
 fruitful relations with Japan and the
 US.
 Internally,  China will                                    continue  its  agriculture--
 focused economic programs  that are                                       essential  to keeping
 food supplies  abreast of population.   These programs
 will nevertheless  enable  industry     to expand capacity
 and output selectively and permit  some modernization
 of the  defense  establishment.   Internationally,       China
 will  seek to play a major role with the  developing
 countries.   It will participate  in aid programs  and
 similar political gestures and will increase  its

 stantial authority over developing countries.   China
 may become  a significant producer and exporter of oil
 by  1980  and problems  could arise  in conflicting off-shore
 oil   claims.
 China still has to decide on the  role  of  foreign
 imports,  particularly  advanced technology,    in its
 growth process.   This  has  been an historic issue  in
 China now  further complicated by    ideology and the  demands
 of modern military-industrial complex.   China's  approach
 in the past has been erratic  and there  is  evidence
 that  this is one  issue which divides the  current leader-
 ship.
 Despite the  death of Mao,  the prime architect  of
 China's  anti-Soviet policy,  China will probably not seek
 a  reconciliation  with  the  USSR.    The  consequences  of  the
 present hostility,  however,  have been so  important  to
 Asia and to the US  that even a moderate  improvement
 (which is possible)    would alter foreign policy  calcula-
 tions  in numerous                                capitals;  outright military   conflict,
 a  lesser possibility, would be  a critical world event.
 Changes  in  either direction will almost certainly  depend

 While  Eastern Europe will  con-
 tinue  to be  under  Soviet  control,  economic uncertainties
 and recurrent pressures  for  some loosening of ties with
 Moscow will complicate the picture.   Poor  in natural
 resources,  the  region is faced with a  slowdown  in economic
 growth rates which could have  repercussions   at  the politi-
 cal  level.                               The  five-year period could see an explosion
 within  some East European  country against Soviet dominance,
 but Moscow would quickly reestablish  its    hegemony,  by
 force  if necessary,  whatever the price  in terms  of other
 policies.   Less spectacularly,   individual  regimes may
 find themselves  able  gradually to expand some areas of
 autonomy,  primarily in domestic policy,  while  adhering
 to Soviet  guidance  in  foreign policy and   security matters.
 The passing of Tito could open a period of difficulty
 and contest  over the  succession and over the  external
 orientation of Yugoslavia,  a period that could be  risky
 should the  Soviets  try to  intervene,  either to prevent
 a westward drift or to pull  the  country eastward.

 the  aspirations  of  the  Arab  side.    As  a  result,  regional
 volatility will remain at a high  level and the  danger
 will persist  that   even a minor incident could result  in
 major military    action.         On  the Israeli  side,  political
 cleavages   stemming  from disagreements      on issues such
 as  the necessity for negotiation and the retention of
 settlements  in occupied territories will  sharply            limit
 the  government's  capacity  for bold,          decisive decision-
 making on non-military  subjects.   The Arab world will
 also  continue to be  rent by  traditional enmities,  to be
 plagued by relentless  Palestinian irredentism,  and to
 be  split into economically handicapped  frontline
 states  and oil producing donor  states.   Nevertheless,

 ing achievement of                         some visible milestones  in       that

 Important potential  sources  of  regional instability
 include  the  continuance of politico-religious  friction
 in  Lebanon,  the  overthrow of key national  leaders  --
 such as                                  Sadat,  Asad,  Husayn, the Shah or the Saudi  royal

 family  ---  or marked  shifts  in attitudes  toward either or
 both  of  the superpowers.      if war resumes  in the Middle
 East      an ever present and largely unpredictable
 possibility             --  Israel would have a decisive military
 advantage    over any  combination of Arab  forces and could
 be  expected to win    the  conflict within several weeks
 time.   Soviet reaction to      the prospect of yet another
 humiliating defeat of  its Arab clients would likely    in-
 clude  the                                  rapid implementation of a massive  resupply
 effort,  and possible  introduction of token Soviet  forces
 in order to exert  further political and psychological
 leverage.    Such actions  by the USSR would  substantially
 increase the  risks  of US-Soviet  confrontation in the
 Middle  East.   In view of  increasing dependency by both
 the  US and its  allies  on Middle Eastern oil,  resumption
 of  fighting or even   lesser  crises could also again im-
 peril Western economies  via  the                                 cutoff or curtailment
 of oil  shipments.
 Although US ability to influence  events  in the  area has
 exhibited a generally  upward trend,  maintenance  of  this
 transitory and fragile     capability  is  dependent  upon
 American  success        in bringing about  real, rather than il-
 lusory,                                   progress toward a     settlement of  the Arab-Israeli
 conflict,  while avoiding confrontation with the   USSR.

 Although a breakthrough  cannot be  ex-
 cluc.'led,  there  is                                         little  in the  situation now to suggest
 that  the  Korean peninsula       five    years  from now will  look
 markedly different  from the way  it  looks        today.   Efforts
 by the   Republic  of Korea to  strengthen its        independent
 military capabilities     are     likely to be met by  equally
 vigorous North Korean efforts to do the  same;         despite
 obstacles  that may be put        in  its  way,   the nuclear option
 is  likely to  look  increasingly attractive  to  the    ROK..
 9. Africa.   Southern Africa and the  Horn of Africa
 will be  areas of  turmoil during the next  several years.
 There will be an   increased risk of communist meddling
 and an increasing    likelihood of  developments which will
 threaten US  interests  and objectives  in these  areas.
 In the  Horn,  there  is a  serious danger of hostilities
 between Somalia,   which will  look to Moscow for  support,
 and Ethiopia,  which may turn to the US.   In  southern
 Africa,  black-white  confrontation is  likely to  increase.
 Whether by  force  or by negotiation,  Rhodesia  and probably
 Namibia will have black majority governments well before
 1983.   These  governments  are  likely to be  radical in na-
 ture,  and in Rhodesia,  particularly if the blacks gain
 power by  force  of arms,  the  government will probably be

 strongly  anti-US.   In        South Africa,  the prospect  is  for
 increased strife   over the  government's  apartheid policies,
 and Pretoria,  surrounded by basically hostile neighbors
 and most likely  confronted with  increased international
 opposition to  its policies,  will         become  even more  iso-
 lated.   In  such a situation,  there  clearly is  a danger
 that the     South Africans might  strike out against  its
 neighbors  or that  they might move    to begin a  campaign of
 insurgency against South Africa.
 10. Economics.    The need for worldwide economic
 intelligence will   continue           to  increase.   The past few
 years  of globally  shared inflation,  recession,    supply
 interruptions  and material     shortages  have underscored the
 high degree  of economic  interdependence among countries
 and its pervasive   impact on American  interests.   To be  of
 value  to US policymakers,  economic  intelligence must
 provide  timely  explanations  of the meaning and implica-
 tions                                of  internal and external economic  developments
 in major   free world and communist nations.   It must  also
 provide  an understanding of  topical  issues, such as  the
 maintenance of world monetary  stability, the  distribution
 of income  as between  rich and poor  countries,  (the  "North-
 South dialogue")  and other                                regional  economic problems,

 situation  continues  to pose  complex problems,  particularly
 whether or not the OPEC cartel will be willing to pro-
 vide  enough oil to meet                            the      rising demands  of consuming
 countries,   and at what price,  if,  indeed,  viability of
 the  cartel  itself  is not once again called into question.
 12.   New Powers and Blocs.   OPEC's  disruption of`  the
 non-Communist world's energy  situation is     likely to  in-
 spire    further  attempts  at                       cooperative efforts  by  small
 nations  to  control  other  important raw materials,  such
 as bauxite and phosphates.   Although most  of these   at-
 tempts will  fail,      efforts                to form various                 types  of pro-
 ducer's  associations by these  developing countries  already
 have had some political effects within many            industrial
 consuming  states as well as on  international  economic;
 and political relationships. Whatever agreements      are
 negotiated between producing  and consuming  countries
 concerning the  supply and price  factors  for         raw ma-
 terials,  the political  and economic effects                                            for the

 international  system --        including the  connections  of
 the  Communist states  to that  system --  could be  signifi-
 cant.    Brazil,  Venezuela,  Nigeria,  and                               Zaire  are  becom-
 ing regional powers                                and are playing more substantial
 roles  in  international  forums.   Aside      from these,  sev-
 eral nations whose                                 ties       to the  US have traditionally
 been  close will display greater    independence.   This will
 be particularly prevalent in the  economic  field but may
 also affect certain US    strategic interests.
 13.   The Developing Countries will present other
 major problems to US policymakers.   The nature     and
 severity of these problems will hinge  in part on  for-
 eign,  especially developing world,  perceptions                           of America's
 ability  -- and willingness  -- to succor its  friends,
 to protect  its  interests  and those of its allies,  and,
 generally,  to play an   active  role  in areas beyond its
 borders.   The  developing countries will be especially
 concerned with US willingness  to  support transformations,
 in their  favor,  in  the  international economic and politi-
 cal  system.

 If the  developing  countries  do not consider that  the US
 and other rich industrial        states  are  sufficiently  forth-
 coming  in  closing  the  gaps                                         between the  developed and less-
 developed worlds,                                        they will  seek outlets  for  their  frus-
 tration  in  assaults on the                                            existing international  sys-
 tem. The  domination by  the  developing countries  of  cer-
 tain  international  forums will result  in increased  con-
 frontation and could eventually incapacitate                                            these forums
 as useful international organizations for  the        industrial
 states.   Also, some  sufficiently angry developing coun-
 tries may  resort to                                 covert actions in attempts              to black-
 mail  selected industrial  states  through terrorism -- of
 a  conventional or nuclear variety -- or through        covertly
 sponsored "liberation  armies."
 14. Social change  will  cause  turbulence and pos-
 sibly  create power vacuums in a number of  areas                                      stemming
 from increased expectations and a perception of the        grow-
 ing  rather than narrowing economic gaps between developing
 countries (and classes within developing countries)  and
 the more  developed industrial world.   Areas particularly
 susceptible to this process will  be  the Persian Gulf,  cer-
 tain other Arab  states  such as Morocco, India,                                           and in
 Latin America,  Argentina,  Peru,  Colombia,  and possibly

 even  Brazil.   Internally this  turbulence may be temporarily
 stilled  by  some authoritarian governments,  particularly
 those benefiting  from increased oil  revenues,  but  they
 will have  difficulties  in maintaining themselves over the
 longer term.    Such turbulence will also exist within  ad-
 vanced nations,                                as  economic,  racial,  ideological,  or re-
 gional minorities                                 turn to violence  and terrorism to press
 their  claims against more  and more delicately tuned and
 interdependent   societies.
 15.   The acceleration of events      will be  characteris-
 tic  of the years  ahead.   This will  come  from improved com-
 munications  and transportation,            sharply reducing the                             time
 available  to reflect on, negotiate, and resolve  interna-
 tional problems.   It will  also raise many  local events                                 to
 international prominence and  inflate national or politi-
 cal pride,  posing further handicaps  to  successful nego-
 tiations.         There will be   a resulting tendency toward
 breakdowns of overloaded institutions, shorter attention
 spans  for individual  situations, and a need for simul-
 taneous perception and management of a multiplicity of
 international relationships.   Such  change will occur
 most  conspicuously  in the fields of  science  and tech-
 nology,  but the pace there will                                 have  substantial  effects
 on the pace of  sociological,  industrial,  and institutional

 change,  with  resultant political  and economic  impacts.
 Identification and accurate  assessments  of  such  changes
 and their                     effects will be needed on an  increasingly
 rapid basis.
 16.                   Interdependence  will  be an  increasingly  important
 characteristic of the world of the        future.   Intelligence
 problems will  also  be  increasingly     interdependent,  re-
 quiring more complex models  for analysis  to give  full
 weight to the number of  disciplines  involved.   For ex-
 ample,  intelligence  on the                                                         USSR's  ability to acquire and
 absorb Western technology will  require  a sophisticated
 interweaving of political,                           economic, military and psy-
 chological  analyses.
 Interdependence also will                                reflect greater national
 dependence on other nations,                            particularly in  the  economic
 sphere.   The  following key variables will be important
 to analyze as  indicators  of  future  trends:   economic
 growth,  population,  energy,  raw materials and food.
