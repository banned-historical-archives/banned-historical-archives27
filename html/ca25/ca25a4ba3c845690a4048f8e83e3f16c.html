9 APRIL 1975 
VIETNAM 
Hanoi and PRG media maintain that the massi.ve communist gains in 
South Vietnam have decisively changed the balance of forces and 
laid the groundwork for "greater victouies." However, there have 
been no predictions of imminent, total military victory. There has 
been nc call for the immediate "liberation" of Saigon as had 
accompanied earlier communist z3ssau1ts on Darning and other areas, 
but a 4 April appeal called on the people in Saigon to "rise up' 
and overthrow Thieu and to "be ready to participate" in the revoluion. 
The media continue to advance the January 1973 Paris peace agreemcnt 
as the basis for a settlement, but there is no evidence of flexibAity 
on terms. Thus, the communists repeat their standard offer to 
negotiate with Saigon only after Thieu has been removed from offi,:e. 
Neithr the PRG nor Hanoi has acknowledged Western reports thai. FRG 
Foreign Minister Nguyen Thi Binh had indicated that France or other 
councries might contribute to a settlement. 
Vietnamese communist comment on the U.S. position, including propa-
ganda pegged to President Ford's 3 April press conference, claims 
Washington is stubbornly clinging to old policies and is confused 
and pessimistic over GVN losses. U.S. steps to assist in evacuations 
have prompted particularly bitter comment, including a 7 April PRG 
statement which denounced efforts to evacuate Vietnamese and labeled 
Americans in Vietnam as "disguised" military personnel who must be 
immediately withdrawn. 
Communist efforts to bring order to newly captured areas were 
reflected in a 10-point PRG policy, released on 3 April, which 
provided a blueprint for occupation and the establishment of new local 
administrations. Liberation Radio has also reported the dispatch of 
PRG officials, i!'cluding President Huyen Tan Phat, to visit the new 
areas of control. Authoritative PRG and DRV statements have reiterated 
appeals for international assistance for these areas, and communist 
media have reported the arrival in Danang of the first shipment of aid 
from the NFLSV/PRG. 
Soviet commentatozs continue to applaud the communist military advances 
but stress the desirability of reaching a peaceful solution. Peking 
media attention to events in South Vietnam is mostly limited to replays 
of Vietnamese Ind other foreign media reports.

communignes. The latest communique, released on 6 April, 
jubilantly cited specific details on the GVN losses of teicitory, 
military personnel, and equipment, and it maintained that the 
communists have achieved a position of unquestionable military 
superiority. Earlier PLA- communiques on 30, 26, and 20 March, 
marked the capture of Danang, Hue, and the central highlands, 
respectively.* 
According to the 6 April communique, "all the manpower, weapons, 
technology, and other means of war in the whole of Military 
Regions I nd 11 have been annihilated and broken up." The 
communique asserted that 2/0,000 troops were put out of action, 
six divisions "wipcd out or completely disbanded," and that the 
five major cities of Hue, Danang, Qui Nhon, Nha Trang and Dalat 
and 16 provinces have been "liberated." As a result of these 
latest gains, the PLAF now claims communist control over 9.3 million 
people "from the 17th parallel to the southernmost tip of Ca Mau." 
The tremendous military advances detailed in the communique of the 
6th give an impression of unbounded optimism for additional PLAF 
battlefield successes and the imminent collapse of GVN control over 
the rrmaining pertion of the country. In describing the communist 
forces' current advantage, the 6 April communique was replete with 
such characterizations as the "sure-to-win position," while it 
depicted the GVN as being in a position of "irretrievable failure," 
and on the verge of "ignominious defeat." Averring that recent 
military gains have brought about "an obvious change in the balance 
of forces between us and the enemy," the communique went on to 
flatly declare that "we are now stronger than the enemy." 
The other three recent PLAF Command communiques had been more 
reticent in evaluating the shift in the balance of forces between 
the GVN and the communist 7)1.-ces. Only the communique of the 20th--
issued after the fall of the highlands--broa lied the issue, but with 
the less categorical claim that "today the strength and position of 
our armed forcrs and people are stronger than ever." Past discussions 
of the balance of forces in Vietnamese communist propaganda have 
ordinarily been couched in phraseology suggesting an ever-increasing 
advantage accruing to the communist forces in the South, and have 
stopped short of rhe unequivocal assertion of superiority that was 
contained in the 6 April communique. 
* For a discussion of the communiques of 20 and 26 March see the 
TRENDS of 26 March 1975, pages 6-10. The communique of the 30th is 
discussed in the TRENDS of 2 April 1975, pages 1-4.

HANOI COMMENT The 6 April PLAF communique's evaluation of 
the balance of forces in South Vietnam has 
been echoed in other comment, including editorials in the major 
Hanoi papers on 7 April. The North Vietnamese army paper QUAN DOI 
NHAN DAN claimed that victories in the South had "led to a funda-
mental change in the balance of forces . . . in which the revolu-
tionary position is much superior to that of the enemy." The 
party paper NHAN DAN compared the situation in the South to that 
at the Lime of the 1945 general uprising that led to the establish-
ment of the DRV. 
Hanoi announced on 8 April that the situation in South Vietnam had 
been discussed that day at a special session of the DRV National 
Assembly S:anding Committee. The meeting was said to have heard 
a report on the "offensive and uprising" by DRV Defense Mirister 
Vo Nguyen Clap, but no details on his remarks have been reported. 
The communique on the session noted that the Standing Committee 
had affirmed that the Southern victory had created "new, exr.remely 
favorable opportunitiec. . . . to continue to advance toward still 
greater victories and to lead the southern revolution to total 
victory." It called upon northerners to "do their best to provide 
support and assistance" to the South. 
PRG, DRV ASSAiL U.S, ROLE IN EVACUATION OF REFUGEES 
Hanoi and the PRG have reacted to U.S. evacuation efforts in South 
Vietnam with an outpouring of wrathful indignation, culminating in 
a government statement from the FRG on 7 April and a DRV Foreign 
Ministry statement on the following day. Vietnamese communist 
invective or he evacuation issue has been harsher than language 
used in recent comment reacting to U.S. officials' statements on 
other issues and seems to reflect communist distress at the widely 
publicized exodus of the South Vietname,e population in advance 
of the communist troops. U.S. actions T.:re also authoritatively 
protested in a 3 April DRV Foreign Ministry statement, a PRG 
Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement of the 4th, and a NHAN DAN 
Commentator article on the 5th. 
The 7 April PRG statement recapitulated earlier complaints directed 
against the United States for aiding the Saigon government by 
transporting refugees fleeing from the war zone. It described the 
rescue open-Aim as a "large-scale forcible evacuation" and an 
attempt to "rake in manpower and material resources to continue the 
war." The statement also accused the United States of "kidnaping" 
thousands of South Vietnamese children and assailed Washington for 
involving other governments and international organizations in the 
operation.

The 7 April PRG statement also called attention to White House 
comment on the poLsibility of employing U.S. troops for the 
protection and removal of U,S. personnel in Vietnam, terming 
thjs "a new scheme aimed at intervening in South Vietnam." It 
cha,:ged, in this connection, that Americdns in Vietnam were 
"military personnel disguised as civilians and jAlegally 
introduced." When a spokesman of the PRG militzxy delegation 
stationed at Saigon's Tan Son Nhut airbase had ')een queried at 
a 15 March press conference od the possible capture of Americans 
at Ban Me Thuot, he replied: "Foreigners, inc1ud1ng honest 
Americans, will be well treated and released if they are 
captured, but this treatment will not be given to U.S. military 
advisers. They are special cases because they have violated the 
Paris agreement. 
(Charges that U.S. military personnel w' re being secretly assigned 
to South Vietnam have been standard communist fare since almost 
immediately after the final 29 March 1973 withdrawal of U.S. 
servicemen from South Vietnam under the terms of the Paris agree-
ment. Current communist propaganda claims t112 continued presence 
of some 25,000 such individuals.) 
The 8 April DRV Foreign Ministry statement reached an even higher 
pitch cf stridency than the PRG statement in reiterating charges 
of "forcible" evacuation of refugees by the United States, 
comparing U.S. actions with "the genocidal crimes perpetrated 
by the Hitler fascists." In this same vein, a 9 April NHPN DAN 
editorial in support of the DRV Foreign Ministry statement termed 
the evacuation operation and removal of South Vietnamese children 
to the United States "a major crime of history, a sordA, filthy 
maneuver, and a most despicable move." The refugee question was 
also discussed at length in a commentary in the army paper on the 
7th which flatly denied that the communists had terrorized or 
retaliated against people in the captured territory and assailed 
the "Ford clique" for raising tbc possibility of "imagit,ary blood 
baths." The commentary also charged that U.S. evacuation efforts 
were serving as a pretext for thc Administration to get more 
military aid for Thieu and as a cover for the mobilization of U.S. 
military forces "to serve as deterrent force in South Vietnam," 
"check the advance of the revolution," and save Thieu.

FBIS TRENDS 
9 APRIL 1975 
The 5 April NHAN DAN Commentator article* cited a Western press 
agency to make the claim that the United States was studying 
plans to move as many as one million people from South Vietnam 
and that a U.S. senator had asked President Ford to deploy the 
"entire Seventh Fleet" to move two million Vietnamese within 
seven days. The Commentator article likewise characterized 
the transfer of Vietnamese orphans to the United States and the 
children killed in the C-5A crash as "crimes" against the 
Vietnamese people. The immediate goal of these moves, according 
to Commentator, is to provide evidence alleging that the 
Vietnamese people are anticommunist and to give the United States 
a "pretext to prolong its involvement." And then without further 
elaboration, he cryptically added: "The imperialists' plan to 
use force to bring many people away is also designed to implement 
their future sinister schemes." 
REACTION TO President Ford's 3 April press conference remarks 
U.S. STATEMENTS on Vietnam prompted a PRG Foreign Ministry spokes-
man's statement of the 4th that took issue with 
the Administration's ordering of U.S. ships to the coastal waters of 
Vietnam to help 1.n the refugee evacuation. A 5 April Hanoi radio 
eport on a NHAN DAN article of the same date on the President's 
press conference said that he had "regretted he could not use the 
U.S. Air Force and admitted that he had no intention of sending 
American forces back to South Vietnam since that is banned by law." 
The article was quick to point out, however, that U.S. contingency 
plans exist to protect and evacuate Americans in South Vietnam and 
Cambodia, and these could include the use of U.S. troops. The same 
article claimed that "Ford blamed the military debacle in South 
Vietnam on Thieu's inep- command, but everyone knows that any 
military plan applied by Thieu was drawn by his U.S. advisers them-
selves." 
Secretary of State Kissinger's 5 April press conference was discussed 
by Hanoi radio on the 7th in a broadcast that derided his remarks on 
Indochina as revealing the "confusion and embarrassment of the White 
House in the face of the irremediable collapse of the Thieu clique 
in Saigon and the country-selling clique in Phnom Penh." A NHAN DAN 
* Commentator is an authoritative byline which has appeared only 
irregularly in NHAN DAN since the signing of the Paris agreement.

1975, pages 1-4.

article of the 6th pegged to Thieu's speech two days before was 
equally caustic in characterizing Walt Rostow as a "nitwit" for 
his recent proposal to land U.S. marines in North Vietnam. 
General George Brown's remarks in Indonesia concerning possible 
direct U.S. intervention into Vietnam failed to elicit any 
significant response from tne PRG or Hanoi. While a spokesman 
for the PRG delegation tc., the La Celle-Saint-Cloud consultative 
conference released a statement on the 7th denouncing Brown's 
speculation as a "serious violation" of the Paris agreement, it 
was essentially low-keyed. A Hanoi radio broadcast of the 8th 
on Brown's "threats" quoted Western press agency reports that 
Congress would "prevent such an intervention at all costs."

MOSCOW SCORES U,S, AID FOR THIEU, PRESSES PRG STAND ON TALKS 
Moscow media have continued to acclaim communist advances in 
South Vietnam while stressing that a political settlement should 
be reached on the basis of the terms offered by the PRG. The 
U.S. role in supporting the Thieu Government was predictably 
attacked by Soviet commentators, but criticism was restrained. 
Moscow commentators have avoided direct criticism of President 
Ford or Secretary Kissinger, instead deploring the desire of 
"certain circles" in Washington and the Pentason to continue 
or expand U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Moscow's circumspection 
regarding the President was strikingly illustrated in the TASS 
accounts of official Vietnamese statements: explicit references 
to the "Ford Administration," were changed to "U.S. Government." 
On the other hand, the President's position has been fully 
reflected. For example, TASS and PRAVDA accounts of his 3 April 
press conference reported his remarks on continued U.S. support 
for Thieu, his appeal for congressional approval of more military 
aid, and his announcement of the dispatch of U.S. ships to the 
Indochina coast and other steps "under the pretext of a possible 
evacuation of retreating Saigon troops." 
ZHUKOV IN PRAVDA The most authoritative current Soviet comment 
on Vietnam was a 5 April article by PRAVDA 
political commentator Yuriy Zhukov. He typically portrayed 
current military action as a popular South Vietnamese uprising 
against the Thieu government, denying the view of 'some people in 
the West" that the GVN was the victim of an offensive launched by 
the DRV or that congressional reductions of aid to the GVN had 
brought about its present deterioration. Zhukov supported the 
Vietnamese communist contention that refugees in South Vietnam 
were not fleeing from the advancing communist forces but rather 
had been forcibly resettled by the Saigon government, and he 
endorsed PRG protests against the movement of U.S. ships to aid in 
evacuation. 
Rejecting as "false allegations" speculation that the communists 
were planning to capture Saigon, Zhukov cited NFLSV-PRG protesta-
tions that they were "only striving for strict fulfillment of the 
Paris agreement, which has been and is being violated most 
flagrantly by the Thieu clique and its patrons." Like other 
Soviet comment, the Zhukov article reiterated the PRG proposal 
for resumption of political talks with Saigon after Thieu has been 
removed, adding: "The new situation taking shape in South Vietnam 
opens up a clear prospect for the establishment of peace."

MIDDLE EAST 
MOSCOW ADDS CAUTIONARY NOTES TO STANDARD CALL FOR GENEVA TALKS 
Having for months urged the "immediate" reconvening of the 
Geneva talks when this seemed a distant prospect, the Soviet 
Union is now advocating the need for adequate advance preparations 
to insure the success of the conference.* Predictably, Moscow 
has pointed to Israeli 'reservations and conditions" as the chief 
complicating factors. But it has also intimated uncertainty 
over the attitude of the United States as its fellow conference 
cochairman as Washington reappraises its Mideast policy, and 
has cited statements by President Ford as indicating U.S. reluctance 
to turn to Geneva. By omission, Moscow has underlined the complex 
problem of getting the Arab participants into line; comment has 
skirted these difficulties, merely sketching a broad picture of 
Arab support for resumption of the conference. 
PREPARATIONS Cautionary Noscow remarks about the necessity 
FOR GENEVA for preliminary preparations began to appear at 
the end of Narch. One of the first to indi7ate 
such concern was Mich,ast specialist Igor Belyayev, on Moscow 
radio's 30 March ascrvers' roundtable. The moderator, noting 
that to recoavene thc. conference "say, tomorrow or the next day" 
would not assure its success, asked Belyayev what were the 
preconditions for a su.-cesslul Geneva conference. Belyayev 
answered that its success would depend primarily on a "positive 
approach by all sides involved" and noted in this regard that 
there was a "broad range of problems" connectA with a Mideast 
settlement--such as determination of participants, particularly 
Palestinian representiltion-- and that "consequently, it is essential 
Ciat much preparatory work be done." He stressed that the Geneva 
conference must be resumed, but only after the "necessary 
prerequisites" for is success had been created. 
Also on the 30th, Kolesnichenko's international review in PRAVPA 
implied the need for advance preparations, remarking that a return 
to Geneva was the practical path in the quest for a Mideast peace, 
but "at the same time farsighted observers stress the importance 
* Moscow's initial comment on the breakddwn of Secretary Kissinger's 
mission pointed to resumption of the Geneva conference 3S the logical 
step, but had made no mention of any necessary prerequisites. See 
the FBIS TRENDS of 26 ilarch 1975, pages 1-3.

of insuriEg that the Geneva conference does not have a dry run." 
And an international review by Mikhaylov in the 1 April IZVESTIYA 
called it necessary "to prepare and organize the work of the 
conference" to insure that the fundamental problems are resolved. 
Moscow also gave a notably lukewarm reception to Egypt's official 
request to the United States and Soviet Union--announced by 
Egyptian Foreign Minister Fahmi on 1 April--that the two cochairmen 
undertake to reconvene the conference. The first monitored Soviet 
acknowledgment of the Egyptian request came in an unattributed 
commentary on Moscow radio's Arabic service on 2 April. Although 
describing the request as "the most important element in the current 
Mideast situation," the broadcast dwelt at length on the difficulties 
involved, emphasizing in particular Israel's "negative attitude" 
and alleged U.S.-Israeli "plans to undermine or postpone" the 
conference. Moscow apparently did not publicly mention the Egyptian 
request again until PRAVDA on the 5th carried a brief Glukhov 
dispatch from Cairo reporting without comment that Fahmi had 
announced the request. The Glukhov dispatch also noted that Fahmi 
had stated Egypt's readiness to send representatives to Geneva 
and had expressed Cairo's support of participation in the talks 
by Great Britain, France, and one nonalined country. 
Scanty Soviet attention to Egyptian activities included a roundup 
in ZA RUBEZHOM (No. 15, signed to press on 3 April) of news reports 
on the Mideast which cited he Cairo ROSE AL-YUSUF to the effect 
that Egypt haLl begun "intensive diplomatic contacts to reconvene 
the Geneva confecence" and that the Egyptian foreign minister was 
currently preparing the necessary documents, including "a joint 
working document with Syria on all the questions to be discussed." 
TASS on the 7th noted that the Egyptian ambassador to the USSR 
had met with Foreign Minister Gromyko to discuss "topical problems" 
concerning the Middle East, "including resumption of the Geneva 
peace conference." 
U.S.-SOVIET ROLE Belyayev was th,. first Soviet commentator 
to work out the details of the Geneva talks. 
Referring in the 30 March roundtable program to the need for 
preparatory work, he went on to say: "Incidertally, there is also 
a mechanism for this. At one time there were special ambassadors 
of the Soviet Union and the United States in Geneva and they had 
to discuss and resolve the essence of those problems which it was 
essential to resolve before the resumption of the work of the 
Geneva conference."

This idea was picked up by PRAVDA's KolesnIchenko In a 1 April 
Moscow radio broadcast to North America. Kolesnichenko recalled 
that joint U.S.-Soviet efforts had created the Geneva conference 
as a mechanism for solving the Mideast crisis and that, under 
present circumstances, "Soviet-Amelican contacts in seeking a 
Mideast peace settlement should in my opinion be stepped up and 
not terminated." And TASS on the 28th, reporting Ftesident Ford's 
24 March Hearst interview which was released on the 27th, noted 
that the President had expressed the view that U.S. rel3tIons 
with the Soviet Union would help avoid an aggravation of the 
Mideast situation. TASS quoted him as saying he was of the 
opinion that in this situation detente would make things easier. 
U.S. POLICY treatment of the President's interview, however, 
generally underlined the United States' lack of 
enthusiasm lor renewing the conference. The TASS account high-
lighted his statement that with the collapse of the step-by-step 
approach the United States "has no other choice" than to return 
to the Geneva conference. The President in fact said "I don't 
believe we have any other choL'e now other than to go to Geneva. 
I regret it but . . . there appears to be no alternative." Also 
citirg the remark on "no other choice," TASS director general 
Zamyatin observed, on Moscow radio's 29 March "International 
Situation" program, that the President's remark was "not very 
definite." And Matveyev, on the 6 April Moscow radio roundtable, 
pointed to the "hint of regret" with which President Ford seemed 
to indicate that the Geneva conference was now inevitable" and 
"thcre was no other way out." 
Limited an testrained comment on the U.S. Mideast policy review 
has in the main suggested Fkepticism about any significant change 
in Washington's relations with Tel Aviv. A Yefremov commentary 
on Moscow's domestic service on the 28th did claim that with 
the failure of the Kissinger mission and the subsequent U.S. 
policy reassessment, "a serious obstacle elt the path to resumption 
of the Geneva conference has been removed." But TMS director 
general Zamyatin, without mentioning the policy review, asserted 
on Moscow radio on the 29th that the United States continued to 
c',Ade a solution" of the key questions of a settlement, talking 
of "the complicated nature of the problem, of Israel being unprepared 
for an all-round settlement, and so forth." Kolesnichenko in 
the 30 March PRAVDA review declined to specLiate on the outcome 
of the policy reassessment, saying that "time will tell" what the 
results might be.

V -E DAY 
SOVIET ARTICLES ON WAR ANNIVERSARY DIFFER ON DETENTE ISSUES 
The early atiicl2s that hcIde appeared in this year's lengthy 
Soviet campain to celebrate the 30th anniversary of victory 
In World War If reflact differing viewpoints regarding current 
policy issues. Some of the articles take a pro-detente stance, 
citing the history of atlied cooperation during the war as a 
model for the present. Others clearly intended to stress 
the importance of maintaining r strong defen3e posture, and 
they cite the alleged primacy of the Soviet Union's contribution 
to tne victory as an object lesson in this regard. Other:: 
take a still more conservative line, stressing the role of 
the party as the organizer of victory, or even the role of 
Stal-In In this regard. It is still too soon to say whether 
these differences reflect a eemergence of internal Soviet 
debate over the (12terte-defense issue or merely the normal 
range of nuances to he expected in this kind or campaign. 
PRO-DETENTE ARTICLES The February CPSD Central Committee 
decree announcing the start of the 
national celebration of the 30th anniversary signaled no 
particular orientation regarding current policy issues. It 
omitted any mention of Stalin, which seemed to suggest a 
pro-detente orientation, but on the other hand it gave no 
more than a perfunctory bow to the role of the allies in the 
war. The Moscow domestic radio carried a summary of the decree 
on 9 February, and KOMMUNIST carried the text in issue No. 3, 
signed to the press on 11 February. The decree's publication 
in nAVDA was unaccountably delayed, hovever, until 98 February.* 
* Moscow radio this year began to give significant coverage to 
the 30th anniversary of V-E Day as early as the second week of 
February and has maintained a substantial level of attention to 
the suject since. This represents a much earlier and much 
heavier stress on the anniversary than obtained for either the 
25th cnniversary in 1970 or the 20th in 1965, when the campaigns 
began only in April.

CONFIDENTIAL FIliS TRENDS 
9 APRIL 1975 
The pro-detente line of commentary on the anniversary was typified 
by a 12 March editorial in IZVESTIYA. it was couched in high-flown 
rhetoric about the anti-Hitler coalition and expressed hope that 
the memorialtzation of the victory would provide a new stimulus 
to detente. More recently, Moscow has sought to link the nnniversary 
with its current oolicy of calling for a world disarmament 
conference. A TASS commentary on 5 April reporting the conclusion 
of the UM committee session on preparing for the conference noted 
that the initiative was appropriately timed to coincide with the 
30th anniversary. 
MILITANT ARTICLES Articles published in the military press or 
written by military authors have generally 
taken a much harsher line on the lessons to be drman from the 
anniversary observances. This can be attributed in part to the 
circumstance that the start of the campaign coincided with the 
annual celebration of Armed Forces Day (23 February)--an occasion 
traditionally marked by bold declarations from military spokesmen. 
Yet even allowing for this,such articles as Maj. Gen. S. Baranov's 
essay on economic preparedness in RED STA' t on 27 February stand 
out as unusually assertive of military interests. Focused largely 
on Soviet econom_c policy in the prewar and war years, the article 
uses some of the most unqualified formulas from Lenin's writings 
to stress the importance of preparin the country foe war. It 
puts a fine topical point on the r.,essage, moreover, by pointing 
out that the party must take into consideration not only the 
present detente situation but other "possible" situations, and by 
declaring that "we will continue to be prepared for any change 
in the development of events." 
CONSERVATIVE ARTICLES A third track taken by some commentators 
on the anniversary has been to stress 
the rolo_ of the traditional party organs in the achievement of 
victory. This is the line taken by chief of the Lenin 'Iilitary 
PolLical Academy, Gen. Ye. Ye. :Ialtsev, in a 4 April article in 
PRA'.DA. Asserting that "all fundamental questions of conducting 
the war were decided by the Central Committee--the Politburo, 
Orgburo, and Secretariat," he went on to say that the polcy 
of the CPSU and its Leninist leadership has been, is, and will 
remain the decisive coadition guaranteeing the invincible defense 
capacity of the Soviet state, the military might of the armed 
forces."

Thc Maltsey article also Illustrates a fascinating sub-theme which 
may become more prominent as the anniversary approaches. This 
has to do with the treatment of Stalin--a sub)uct which 
Is unsettled in the Soviet Union despite repeated regime efforts 
to strike a balanced assessment. Maltsev, by his unusual 
recitation of the names of the top party bodies, manoged to 
avotd recalling the extraordinary party-str.te-military bodies 
with which Stalin was more intimately associated, and indeed 
railed to mention Stalin's name at all. Other recent articles, 
however, have mentioned Stalin's role, although these articles 
appear to be in the minority thus far. Lt. Gen. S. Bobylev, 
writing in the l Apr 1.1 WRA. LIFE, referred to "Sect-2tary General 
1.V. Stalin" as head of the w,-rtine State Defense Committee, 
and Maj. Gen. M. Kir'yan, writing in the 4 April RED STAR, noted 
as well that Stalin was head of the Supreme Comman I as well as 
of the State nefense Committee. 
Even before the current anniversary campaign, pressure to give 
Stalin more credit had become apparent from several quarters. 
The most blatant example was Ukrainian First Secretary Shcherbitskiy, 
who hailed Stalin's role in an 18 October 1974 speech celebrating 
the 30th anniversary of the liberation of the Ukraine. Other 
spokesmen in the Ukraine have followed Shcherbitskiy's lead. In 
the meantime, the film of Aleksandr Chakovskiy's novel on the 
war, which contains extensive descriptions of Stalin's lealership, 
is currently running in Moscow and Leningrad theaters, and 
installments of the novel have appeared in the last four issues 
of the journal ZNAMYA. 
Conservatives have :Aso lately been pressuring writers to stress 
the victories in the war, rather than the embarrassing initial 
defeats. Belorussian First Secretary Iasherov, in a 27 February 
speech to writers reported in the March KO:MNIST BELORUSSII, 
complained of "one-sided" and "erroneous treatment" of the 
initial period of the war and declared it "completely Licolerable" 
to undermine the people's pride in their "hecoic victory." 
Similarly, at a 14 March Moscow writers union meeting reported 
in the 16 March MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA, Moscow First Secretary 
Grishin complained that some periods of the war have been described 
in dozens of books while other periods were being ignored.

USSR-YUGOSLAVIA 
MOSCOW TRIES TO MOLLIFY TITO ANGER OVER OFFENSIVE ARTICLES 
Yugoslav-Soviet relations were considerably exacerbated in the 
week before Premier Bijedic's scheduled 9-15 April visit to the 
USSR, as President Tito and Yugoslav media reacted angrily to 
newspaper articles by Warsaw Pact commander Yakubovskiy and 
Soviet Defense Minister Grechko which, according to Belgrade, 
"belittled" the wartime role of Tito's partisan army. Moscow 
attempted to improve the atwosphere for Bijedic's visit, but 
perhaps insufficiently, with an 8 April TASS interview of a 
low-level Soviet official who praised the partisans' contribution 
to defeating Nazi Germany and acknowledged that the partisans 
deserved the credit for liberating Yugoslavia, but did not 
mention the offending articles. 
Yakubovskiy's article, in the 25 March CSSR party daily RUDE 
PRAVO and aooarently pegged to next month's 30th anniversary of 
V-E Day, was sharply criticized by Tito in a 2 April speech in 
Skopje, although he eschewed direct reference to Yakubovskiy or 
the article. Related media comment on the other hand was both 
direct and more vitriolic, denouncing Yakubovskiy as well as 
Grechko, whose supposedly similar article appeared in the 3 
April issue of the CSSR Defense Ministry's OBRANA LIDU, not yet 
available in Washington. Yakubovskiy heaped praise on the Red 
Army's ro2_e in liberating East Europe while minimizing the 
contribution of other East European forces. Particularly offensive 
to Belgrade was his characterization of the various liberation 
movements as one individual movement and his implication thi.t all 
resistance movements in East Europe owed their success to the 
Red Army. 
Tito seemed particularly disturbed that Yakubovskiy's generalized 
treatment of the liberation movements in effect equated the 
Yugoslav partisans' campaign against the Germans with that of the 
Bulgarians. Belgrade recently has shown increased sensitivity 
to mplicit Soviet support for Sofia's contentions that Bulgarian 
troops liberated Macedonia, which Belgrade interprets as a 
Bulgarian effort to lay claim to Macedonian territory. Questioning 
the policical motivations behind the article, Tito took the occasion 
to re.27,11 last year's Corinformist affair in noting that Belgrade 
would continue to resist those "mini-groups" and individuals 
who "take the same stands as those who assert that they liberated

us . . . ." Tito also seemed to be warninr Moscow that its 
"falsifIcation" of history could influence Belgrade's foreign 
ties, maintaining that it would be a "disgrace" for the partisans' 
wartime record to be recognized by the West but not by their 
closest wartime allies. 
Yugoslav media were more explicit in presenting Belgrade's fears 
regarding the implications of Yakubovskiy's and Crechko's articles. 
For example, Zagreb commentator Sundic on the 3d questioned 
taetorically whether such articles could be written by officials 
who favored good relations with Yugoslavia. And POLITIKA, 
as reported by TANJUG on the 5th, argued that conceding that an 
outside force had liberated Yugoslavia would mean giving that 
force "an opportunity to lay claim on our present and future." 
Belgrade comment in an 8 April Russian-language broadcast was 
more restrained, referring only to "foreign" attempts to belittle 
the partisans' wartime record and to "falsify" history. The same 
commentary acknowledged the Soviet Union's contribution to defeating 
Nazi Germany but added that Soviet aid to the partisans did not 
begin until 1943 and that the partisans liberated Yugoslavia 
"mainly with our own forces." 
Moscow's efforts to smooth over the trouble caused by t.he two articles 
was relegated mainly to Vladimir Zelenin, a historian obviously 
lacking the status of the two marshals. Zelenin, identified as 
a representative of Moscow's Institute of Slavic and Balkan 
Studies, was a former military adviser to the partisans in 
1944-46. He was called on during the 1950's to broadcast several 
commentaries to Yugoslavia hailing Soviet-Yugoslav wartime 
cooperation and wrote a handful of similar articics in the 
1960's. Ze-enin's TASS interview was rich in praise of the 
partisans; he was also careful to point out that Yugoslav 
communists began their operations against Lae Germans in 1941, 
thus "earlier than other European peoples." Zelenin also conceded, 
in effect, that at least in the early years of the war, the partisans 
fought the Germans in Yugoslavia on'their own. In addition to 
the Zelenin interview, an IZVESTIYA article, as reported in a Serbo-
Croatian broadcast to Yugoslavia on the 8th, welcomed Bijedic's visit 
with a positive assessment of relations between the two countries and 
highly praised the "heroic struggle" of the Yugoslav partisans. 
'n addition to concern aLout Bijedic's visit, ZIOSCC4IS sensitivity 
to Belvade's pique over the two articles may reflect its interest 
in creating a harmonious atmosphere for the 30th V-E Day observance 
in Moscow next month. The CPSU Central Committee and the Supreme Soviet 
Presidium have extended an invitation to Tito's number two man, Stane 
Dolarc, according to a 17 March TANJUG report.

LOW-KEYED ANNIVERSARY OBSERVANCE SUGGESTS CONTINUED TENSIONS 
Delivery of the main address at Hungary's 30th liberation anniver-
sary observance on 3 April by the figurehead President Losonczi 
and the attendance of only a second-level SovieL figtv_e, CPSU 
Secretary Kapitonov, suggest that Moscow-Budapest tensions over 
the latter's liberal economic policies iday be persisting, despite 
the appear ,lce of cordiality during Brezhnev's attendance at the 
recent MSZMP congress.* Brezhnev and Hungarian party First 
Secretary Kadar had been the main speakers at the 25th anniversary 
festivities in Budapest in 1970, while both countries' presidents, 
Mikoyan and Dobi, spoke at the 20th anniversary in 1965. 
Losonczi's fig'trehead status is underscored by the fact that he 
is the Lily president of an East European Soviet ally who is not at 
tl!e same time a member of the party Politburo. 
Top leaders of the two countries participated in Hungary's 30th 
liberation anniversary only peripherally: An interview with Kad:!r 
was carried on Moscow and Budapest TV on the 2d, and Premier Fock 
was in Moscow on the 7th, three days after the anniversary date, 
for the opening of a Hungarian exhibit, also attended by Kosygin 
and Podgornyy. The Soviet leaders' anniversary message to their 
Hungarian counterparts appeared to take into account conjectures 
regarding Moscow-Budapest tensions when it stressed "the 
indestructible unity of views" of the CPSU and MSZMP "on all 
fundamental matters in the construction of socialism and communirm." 
The Soviet leaders' ataiversary messages to their Polish, Bulgarian, 
and East German counterparts had merely underscored bilateral 
friendship and solidarity rather than stressing indestructible 
ideological unity. 
The keynote address by Losonczi at the Budapest meeting on 3 April 
paid due tribute to the USSR's liberation of Hungary and subsequent 
friendship and support for his country, Among other things, 
Losonczi expressed appreciation to the CPSU and the Soviet Government 
for their help in shielding the Hungarians from the effects of

the GDR's 25th anniversary observance in October.

spiraling world market prices for energy. Endorsing detente, 
the Hungarian president declared that the task of Hungarian 
foreign policy was to promote the success of "the socialist 
coultries' peace policy" and underscored Budapest's contribution 
to strengthening the forces of "socialism, national independence, 
peace, and detente." Losonczi's speech did not include any 
mention of Brezhnev, unlike Kadar's address at the recent party 
congress and his anniversary TV interview on 2 April. At the 
congress, Kadar had thanked Brezhnev personally for helping 
the Hungarians on the oil-price issue, and his TV interview 
praised Brezhnev as a world leader in the quest for 
peace. 
Regarding the 1956 "counterrevolution," the Hungarien president 
paid due tribute to "the internationalist aid of the Soviet 
Union and the international working class" in saving socialism. 
Stressing the Hungarian communists' own role, he recalled that 
"we managed to conquer the dark forces of counterrevolution 
because .:he party pursued a consistent struggle against both 
sectarianism and revisionism, and we reestablished Leninist 
norms." While not directly mentioning the controversial new 
economic management system, Losonczi was in tune wita Budapest's 
current de-emphasis of that syctem in registering the Hungarians' 
determination to strengthen the party's leading role, the planned 
economy, and "systematic" economic development. Underscoring 
Budapest's membership in CEMA, he declared that his country would 
utilize "primarily international socialist economic integration." 
Losonczi's failure to mention BrezhneN, was made the more obvious 
by Kapitonov's twice recalling the Sov:et leader's participation 
in the recent Hungarian party ccngress and conveying Brezhnev's 
personal greetings, in addition to reading the anniversary 
message from the three Soviet leaders. The brief speech, much 
shorter than Losonczi's, firmly undersc:7red the primary Soviet 
role in detente, pointing to the USSR's implementation of the 
peace program of the 24th CPSU Congress and stressing that "the 
socialist countries, coordinating their efforts," were jointly 
working for this cause. 
Putting the best possible face on Moscow-Budapest relations, 
Kapitonov acknowledged Losonczi's expression of gratitude for 
Soviet liberation of Hungary, voiced sati:faction with the current

KADAR INTERVIEW Kadar's interview with Moscow radio and TV 
correspondent Kaverznev, aired in Moscow 
and Budapest on the 2d, was notable for his strong praise of 
Brezh.tev and for his modest estimate regarding the prospects 
for achieving the goal of completing the building of socialism, 
set by the MSZMP congress' program declaration published on 
9 March. Asked about the program declaration's goal of 
completing socialist construction in Hungary in the next 
15-20 years, Kadar reulied that "we cannot really say whether 
we are two-thirds of the way [in the 1945-1990 time span] 
toward building a developed socialist society." To achieve 
such a goal, he added, Hungary faces "major tasks" in the form 
of two to three-fold increases in sue.' areas as national income 
and industrial and agricultural production. He insisted that 
the Central Committee and the party congress had made their 
estimates "responsibly and, as far as was humanly possible, set 
realistic targets." 
In praising Brezhnev, Kadar went beyond Brezhnev's contributions 
to USSR-Hungarian relations and referred to "that eminent and 
outstanding fighter for the cause nf socialism and peace known 
throughout the world, Comrade Leonid Ilich Brezhnev." Apparently 
attempting to discredit reported Soviet-Hungarian differences, 
Kadar added that Brezhnev's speech at the Hungarian party congress 
and the welcome given him in Budapest had demonstrated "our 
cloudless and unshakable friendship."

PRC FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
CHINESE VICE PREMIERS LEAD DELEGATIONS TO IRAN, MEXICO 
Peking's increasingly active role in world diplomacy and its 
higher international profile were illustrated by recent, unpre-
cedentedly high-level visits by Chinese vice premiers to Iran 
and Mexico, the first of a long-overdue series of trips abroad 
by ranking Chinese leaders to reciprocate the many visits to 
China by foreign leaders in recent years. The Chinese visits 
reflect the normalization of Chinese government operations 
in January by the National People's Congress, which appointed 
10 new vice premiers, thus providing a total of 12 deputies to 
assist ailing Premier Chou En-lai and making it possible to 
send high-ranking officials on diplomatic missions outside 
China. The current visits are in belated response to visits 
to China by the Iranian and Mexican heads of government in 
1972 and 1973 respectively, and they underscore the importance 
Peking attaches to solidifying relations with these influential 
Third World states. 
LI HSIEN-NIEN Vice Premier Li Hsien-nien's current tour of 
VISIT TO IRAN Iran was highlighted by a 6 April "cordial and 
friendly" talk with the Shah and by a 5 April 
banquet hosted by the Iranian prime minister, during which Li 
endorsed Iran's policies in several sensitive areas. Offering 
Peking's first comment on the recent Iranian-Iraqi agreement 
on borders and other issues, Li praised "both parties" for 
settling the dispute, and said the accord was "a very good thing" 
that showed the underlying unity of Third World states and 
enhanced stability and peace in the Persian Gulf. During a 
brief visit to Iran in June 1973, then Chinese Foreign !linister 
Chi Peng-fei had defended Teheran's heavy defense expenditures 
as necessary to counter Baghdad's close ties with the USSR.* 
During the latest visi:, Li, following Chi's pattern in 1973, 
supported Iran's stand on Persian Gulf countries settling 
their own affairs and the establishment of an Indian Ocean 
zone of peace. And Li added the highest-level Chinese endorse-
ment to date of Iran's proposal for the establishment of a 
nuclear-free-zone in the Middle East. The vice premier Plso

used the occasion to voice Peking's first authoritative comment 
on last month's OPEC summit conference in Algiers, hailing its 
"great achievements" and offering generalized Chinese backing 
for the developing countries' rights to control their natural 
resources and to demand the establishment of a new international 
economic order. 
Also following the pattern displayed during Ch.. Peng-fei's 1973 
visit, Li warned that superpower contention was the most serious 
threat to the Persian Gulf area, while concurrent Chinese comment 
has made it clear that Peking sees the Soviet Union as the real 
danger in the zrea and the United States as a stabilizing influ-
ence. For example, a 4 April NCNA report, released on the same 
day that Li left Peking, favorably replayed remarks by CENTO 
military leaders during a recent meeting in Pakistan. It noted 
their affirmation that the U.S.-backed alliance continued to 
play a "useful role" in the area and that it continued to make 
"significant progress in providing an atmosphere of security 
and stability in the region." The report underlined Teheran's 
role in the alliance by noting that bases in Iran would be used 
in upcoming CENTO military exercises. 
The first monitored Soviet reaction to Li's visit, an 8 April 
Radio Peace and Progress commentary in English to Asia, pointed 
to the 4 April NCNA dispatch on CENTO as well as reports of Li's 
remarks in Teheran in criticizing the Chinese for preaching 
"a sermon of war" and supporting an "imperialist military" 
presence in the area, which it said was contrary to the developing 
Asian states' alleged desire for a system of "collective security. 
CHEN YUNG-KUEI PRC Vice Premier Chen Yang-kuei's 27 March - 
VISIT TO MEXICO 7 April visit to exico was hailed by NCNA 
as an affirmation of the "time-honored tradition 
of amity" existing between the two countries. No communique was 
issued and no agreements were announced. But Chen's lengthy visit 
and NCNA's extensive coverage may be read as a demonstration of 
China's overall interest in expanding relations with Latin America 
and its recognition of the Third World role played by Mexico's 
President Luis Echeverria, whose 1973 visit to the PRC was the 
first such trip by a noncommunist Latin chief of state.* 
* Echeverria's visit is discussed in the TRENDS of 25 April 1973, 
page 15-16. The only previous trip to Peking by a Latin head of 
state was the September 1961 visit by Cuban President Osvaldo 
Dorticos.

Chen, the highest-ranking Chinese official ever to visit Latin 
America, began his stay by reiterating Peking's support for 
the Echeverria-initiated Charter of Economic Rights and Duties 
of States (CERDS), which was endorsed at the last UN Genera). 
Assembly session and by which Echeverria hopes to enhance 
Mexico's status as a Third World leader. As reported by NCNA 
on 28 March, Chen characterized the charter as "the just call 
of the Third World countries against imperialist plunder and 
exploitation" and added that China "firmly supports the just 
struggle of the Mexican Government and people." Stressing 
the usual Chinese theme of solidarity with developing countries, 
Chen said that "in the long struggle against imperialism and 
colonialism" Mexico and China "have always sympathized wit'l 
and supported each other." Noting that this historical tradition 
had been accelerated since President Echeverria's April 1973 
visit to China, Chen said that the two nations had "not only 
supported each other politically, but have also learned from 
and helped each other in the economic field." 
Elaborating on the theme of economic cooperation at a FRC-hosted 
banquet reported by NCNA on 4 April, Chen indicated what might 
be one of the conc.7ete results of the trip when he noted that his 
visit to Mexico had shown him many opportunities for cooperation, 
"especially in the exchange of agricultural sciences and tech-
nologies." Chen concluded that "our future common struggle to 
defend national sovereignty and develop the national economy' 
would strengthen the "traditional friendship and relations of 
friendly cooperation between the two countries." 
The only monitored Moscow mention of Chen's Mexican visit came in 
a TASS dispatch from Mexico City on 7 April which reported that 
the Mexican socialist party had demanded that the PRC break 
diplomatic relations with the "fascist regime" in Chile. This 
demand, TASS said, was conveyed "to PRC Deputy Premier Chen lung-
kuei duri.lg his vist to Mexico."

FBIS TRENDS 
9 APRIL 1975 
CHANG WARNS PARTY MEMBERS TO FOLLOW MODERATE ECONOMIC LINE 
A major, authoritative article by CCP Politburo member C;:ang 
Chun-chiao in the April RED FLAG underscores Peking's resolve to 
use the current ideological campaign to strike a cautious balance 
between the pursuit of economic goals and adherence to ideological 
principles. Signed press articles by Politburo members have been 
extremely rare in recent years, but a new pattern now seems to 
have developed, linked to the start three months ago of the 
campaign to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
Chang's article, entitled "On Exercising All-round Dictatorship 
Over the Bourgeosie," follows by only a month another article 
in RED FLAG by Politburo member Yao Wen-yuan, who called for 
order and discipline to meet China's economic goals set by Chou 
En-lai in his report to the Fourth National People's Congress (NPC) 
in January.* Chang's article elaborates on this theme, charting 
a mo6erate economic course for meeting Chou's ambitious objectives. 
He argued that communist ecoaomic reforms must be postponed to 
allow sufficient time "to build China into a powerful socialist 
country before the end of the century. Indicating that errant 
cadres from both the right and the left sould move toward the 
center on the issue of economic reform, Caang warned party 
members who have joined the party organizationally but not 
ideologically that "it is dangerous to stop half-way! The 
bourgeoi.45e is beckoning you. Catch up with the ranks and 
continue tne advance!" 
Much authority is attached to any pronouncement by Chang, who 
shares the daily duties of operating China's government with 
party Vice Chairman Teng Hsiao-ping. At the beginning of the 
cultural revolution Chang was a party secretary in Shanghai, 
having risen to the post through the municipal literary 
bureaucracy in the years since 1949. He supported Chiang Ching's 
cultural reforms and played a role in launching the struggle 
that produced the cultural revolution. In 1967 the central 
authorities entrusted Chang with running Shanghai, and he was 
named to the Politburo at the Ninth Party Congress in 1969, 
moving up to the standing committee of the Politburo at the 10th 
Party Congress in 1973. Chang was named a vice premier at the

Lion. Shanghai mdta reports on (hang's activftles during ii It; 
tenure in the city suggesL he is an f.conomfc moderate who 
favors central planning and central allocation of resou:ces, 
an Impression strengthened by the current RED FLAG article. 
COrMUNIZATION Much of Chang's article seemed to be addressed 
to left-leaning cadres holding the mistaken 
idea that China should quicken the pace of communization and 
thus speed the transition into a communist state. Discrediting 
this approach, which was tried during the late 1950's and 
resulted In serious economic shortfalls, Chang indicated that 
rapid communization was not desired at this time and he 
criticized cadres who spread "rumors about a wind of 'communi-
zation' being stirred up." Makihg it clear that the current 
stress on meeting production goals in 1975 should not be 
misinterpreted by local cadres as a signal for rapid communi-
zation, Chang declared that "the wind of 'communization' as 
stirred up by Liu Shao-chi and Chen Po-ta shall never be 
allowed to rise again." He ruled out any attempt to rapidly 
increase the current level of communization by arguing that 
"our country does not yet have a great abundance" of commodities. 
Chang developed the thesis that until communes were able to 
"offer a great abundance of products for distribution according 
to need among our 800 million people, it would be necessary 
to take proper measures to "curb the harm caused" by those 
remaining capitalist practices affecting the development of a 
socialist economy. 
While throwing cold water on any plans to quickly expand the 
current level of communization, CL'Ing reported approvingly 
thrIc there was a gradual trend toward a higher degree of public 
ownership in rural areas. Chang used a commune near Shanghai 
as an example of this trend, the commune ci?ed apparently 
being a model showing how China could eventually realize the 
theoretical objective of shifting a higher share of production 
to the large commune base, leaving less for the smaller levels 
of brigades and production teams. Chang noted that in the year 
from 1973 to 1974, the commune-level income share of total income 
here rose from 28.1 to 30.5 percent and the brigade-level share 
rose from 15.2 to 17.2 percent, while the income share oi the 
smaller production teams dropped from 56.7 to 53.3 percent.

Scressing the in?ed to increase slowly t 10 oroduct Ion share :it. 
Hie commune level, Chang noted Hull In the rural peonle's 
communes lust outside ilhanghal, where the economy at the 
commune and production brigade levels has developed with 
"good speed," the production teams still accounted for ')0.7 
percent of thv total fixed assets owned by all three levels. 
Putting any ma Ion economic changes far Into the future, Chang 
argued that. "It will take a fairly long time to effect the 
transition from the team to the brigade an0 then to the commune, 
functioning as the basic accounting unit." He explained that 
"even when the commune is made the basic accounting unit, it 
will still remain under collective ownership," thus necessitat-
ing the "Inevitable" conthluation of "commodity production, 
exchange through money, and distribution according to work."

Ind i ea Led t_ in "boti tt I r I gilts" mus t even t ua I I y

in strengthening socialist economic development. Chang argued 
that the harmful effects of certain "bourgeois rights" should 
be to temporarily (hiring the cnirrent socialist stage in 
order to help develop the state's economic potential, strengthen 
the economic base, and provide the necessary conditions for the 
eventual transition into a communist society. 
Material incentives do not appear to be among those "bourgeois 
rights" which will be allowed to play a role in the current 
socialist. economy. Evidence of this was (:hang's at tack on Lin 
Piao and Liu Shao-chi for taking "advantage of the inexperionce 
of young people" and "peddling among the youth the idea that 
material incentive is like fermented bean curd: although it 
smells bad, it tastes delicious." Emphasizing the call for 
cadres to make greater efforts to substitute ideological pro-
duction incenti1.2s for material ones--a major lteme of the 
current dictatorship campaign?Chang quoted a passage from a 
previously unpublicized lfl69 lao speech: the passage criticized 
party leaders in some factories for "resorting to material 
incentives, putting profits in command and, instead of promoting 
proletarian politics, handing out bonuses, and so forth." 
Spelling out the current dilemma facing party leaders charged 
with increasing production levels, Cnang called upon cadres to 
learn how to balance the goal of "building a powerful country" 
with a concern for maintaining proper ideological objectives. 
Illritrating this point, Chang pointed to the "Khrushchev-Brezhnev

[MORD! R In setting forth N go-slow, middle-of-the-road 
approach to r?:torming the economy, Chang's article 
appears to reflect Peking's concerti to keep the dictatorship 
campaign under tight central control, thus preventing social 
disruptions and shortfalls in economic production. Peking's 
fears appear to he well-gronnded: recent PofeI broadcasts have 
revealed that Anhwei party officials are engaged in struggling 
against the actions of "active counterrevolutionaries and bad 
elements sabotaging raIl transport." A 7 April Hofei broadcast 
reported that the central authorities had Issued instructions 
For local. railway workers and armymen living along the railways 
"to take prompt action . . . to deal heavy blows at the handful 
of class enemies carrying out the criminal activities of 
sabotaging rail transport." Arguing that "rail transport is 
of utmost importance in the national economy," the broadcast 
focused on the need to "maintain order in railway stations and 
on trains" in order to "promote stability and unity." 
Problems with Anhwei's transportation network appear to date 
back at least to 27 March, when the local radio reported that 
a rally of 100,000 people had called for "strengthening social 
security and maintaining good soci.?1 order for the successful 
development of both revolution and production." The rally 
concluded that it was "Imperative" to arouse the masses to 
struggle against class enemies "who sabotage industi.ial and 
agricultural productioo or communications and transport services."

CH1NLSL LLADIRSHIP: The death of CCP Politburo member and former 
I( ting Chief of State Tung Pi-wu at the agt of 90, announced by 
NCNA on 1 April, leaves Mao Tse-tung as the only living founder 
of thv CCP. Neither Mao nor Chou En-lai attended the memoz-lal 
meeting fo:- Tung on 7 April In Peking. The memorial was presided 
over by Wang Hung-wen, the party's third-ranking leader under 
Mao and Chou. Yeh Chien-ying's memorial speech eulogized Tung 
as a "great revolutionary fighter" and urged "translating our 
grief" over his death to the campaign to strengthen the dictator-
ship of th proletariat and "building China into a strong and 
modern socialist country." Mao has been absent from public 
view since 16 January, when he received West Cerman CS0 leader 
Strauss while the National People's Congress (NPC) was In session 
In Peking. Mao has made no reported public appearances In Peking 
since May 1974, when he apparently left the capital. Chou En-lai 
has not appeared outside the hospital since 15 January when he 
attended the funeral for Vice Premier Li Fu-chun, although he 
continues to receive a steady flow of toreign guests in the 
hospital. 
CHIANG KAI-SHEK DEATH: A low-key 6 April NCNA report on Chiang 
Kai-shek's death expressed Peking's confidence that Chiang's 
demise would enhance movement in Taiwan toward reunIfication 
with the mainland. In contrast to Peking's past expressions of 
"hope" that people and leaders n Taiwan would work tor reunifica-
tion, NCNA said emphatically that Chiang's passing "will certainly" 
encourage "people" in Taiwan to "further efforts" to liberate the 
island. NCNA also claimed that "military and administrative 
personnel" in Taiwan "will have a clearer view of the situation" 
and will actively contribute to Taiwan's reunification. The 
report characterized Chiang's named successor, Yen Chia-kan, as 
a "puppet president," but avoided all mention of the critical 
role now played by Chiang's eldest son, ROC Premier Chiang 
Ching-kno, who has been criticized by Peking in the past. The 
re!)ort contained only a passing reference to Chiang Kai-shek's 
reliance on "U.S. imperialism" while in Taiwan. Moscow has thus 
far not commented on Chiang's death, confining its coverage of 
the event to a one-sentence 5 April TASS report noting news agency 
reports on his passing.
