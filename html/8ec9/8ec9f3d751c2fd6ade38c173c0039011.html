DAILY BRIEF 
*Cony: E_UN representatives in New York say that by the 
end of 28 ebruary Luluabourg was a "UN city," with all 
Congolese troops cleared from the town and the airport. 
Earlier,   most of the Gizengist 
force which entered Luluabourg last week was disarmed by 
Congolese forces there loyal to Leopoldville. 
 the Gizengist force arrived "hungry and in rags," 
consisted largely of new recruits, and "gave up without a 
fight" after failing to swing a majority of the Luluabourg 
troops over to their cause. Hammerskjold commented to 
Ambassador Stevenson in New York on 28 February that 
he felt troop movements such as have recently taken 
place in the Congo are not bringing about a significant mil-
itary or political shift in the balance of power among the 
various factionE 
Gizenga is continuing his demands for outside aid. On 
28 February,  
Gizenga said, "I hasten to insist that your republic come to 
our aid immediately," and reiterated that Stanleyvilles re-
quest to buy long-range aircraft--in exchange for Congolese 
goods--is "very important." On 1 March Gizenga's representa-
tive in Cairo asked for permission to go to Moscow in order 
to "settle the Question about the airplanes." Gizenga has 
itself if provided with long-range aircraft.

Ebinet's subcommittee on foreign affairs on the 27th, warns 
that if the issues of Hammarskjold's status and the Congo are 
not kept separate, "we shall never find a solution to the Congo 
problem." Subsequent discussion by the subcommittee indicated 
that both Nehru and Defense Minister Menon are thinking in 
terms of sending a brigade-size unit (about 3,000 men) of In-
dian soldiers to the Congo. A final decision, however, awaits 
assurances from Hammarskjold that Belgian personnel are in 
fact being withdrawn from the Congo. In addition, Nehru is 
awaiting a reply from Nasir to a letter sent on 26 February in 
which the Indian leader sought to persuade Nasir of the desir-
ability of reinforcing the UN forces in the Congo. Furthermore, 
Nehru is reported especially concerned about avoiding clashes 
between Indian troops and any. African troops which might be  
sent imilntprally to sunnort the Gizencra ree1me-7

withdrawal irregulars from the Burma-Laos border area, C, k

has been given responsibility for the operation, said he plans p

staff, has reportedly ordered irregulars recruited for special 
battalions, but except for a battalion of local tribal peoples that 
had been serving with the Nationalists, no Chinese Nationalist  
tr7ODS have joined the Laotian armed forces)

14-nation conference could achieve worthwhile results. 
In Burma's view, the prerequisites for 
the restoration of stability in Laos were an agreement by all 
� countries not to intervene in any way in Laotian internal af-
fairs and an agreement among all major Laotian factions to 
hold free elections under the supervision of a neutral commis-
sion. Burma would be willing to serve 
on such a commission.   
France: Flie fourth French nuclear weapons test in the 
Sahara is expected to be a tower shot in late March or April. 
The test will coincide with US-UK-USSR test ban talks which 
are to be resumed in Geneva beginning 21 March, De Gaulle, 
determined to obtain "full membership in the atomic club," 
continues to maintain that France would not agree to a test ban 
unless it were bound up with agreements on the destruction of 
nuclear, weapons stockpiles. Paris is apparently willing to face 
the increasingly hostile reaction which is expected from African 
and Middle Eastern states, including a censure move in the 
United Nations. The announcement that later French tests will  
be underground is unlikely to calm this hpstile reaction? 
thina: Peiping appears to feel the need for a 
limited liberalization of scientific thought and an increase in 
freedom of expression among the country's intellectuals. An 
editorial published in the 28 February issue of the party journal, 
Red Flag, reviving the concept of "let 100 flowers bloom," states 
that the findings of scientists should be welcomed even if they 
lack a "Marxist-Leninist viewpoint." The Chinese Communists 
have recently released and allowed to appear in public several 
prominent intellectuals who were arrested in the aftermath of 
the 1957 liberalization fiasco. Remembering the campaign 
against those who had expressed themselves too freely, before, 
the intellectuals will be  extremely wary about the new invitation 
to "bloom and contend." (Backup, Page 2)

Brazil-Yugoslavia: The Yugoslav Government,

favorable time. Although Yugoslav interests in Latin America 
are limited, Tito has long wished to tour the western hemisphere. 
He should have little trouble in arranging visits to some other 
Latin American enuntries and can be expected to seek an invi-
tation to the US. (Backup, Page 3) 
Ecuador: Foreign Minister Chiriboga has told an American 
officia=the intends to resign at the cabinet meeting on 3 
March, unless President Velasco agrees to change his in-
creasingly favorable policy toward Cuba. Chiriboga's resigna-
tion could provoke a cabinet crisis. The foreign minister's 
stand is directly related to the return from Havana of the pro-
Cuban, pro-Soviet former minister of government, Manuel 
Araujo, a key lieutenant of Velasco who publicly denounced 
Chiriboga on 21 February as a "State Department servant." 
Araujo reportedly plans to promote mass unrest and may have 
gained a dominant influence over Velasco in regard to policies 
toward both Cuba and the Soviet bloc.

they have the capability to do so. There is an uncon-
firmed report that the Communists have a plan to 
Initiate operations at an unspecified time in the south 
of Laos. They have the capability to initiate such ac-

Kong Le resources. Large-scale action would require 
outside resources such as Viet Minh; we consider this to 
be unlikely at this time. Meanwhile, the Communist bloc

they can get away with in resisting any UN move to neu-
tralize their forces. Under the impetus of the Kasavubu-

Situation in the Congo 
(fhe threat the Gizengist incursion into Luluabourg appeared 
to pose to Leopoldville reportedly aroused many leaders of 
ICasavubuis government to the point of being willing,for the first� 
time, to take forceful action. These leaders are said to be 
urging Mobutu, who is now near Bumba with about 1,500 men, 
to attack Orientale Province "even if the troops must open 
fire." It is questionable, however, whether Mobutu's forces 
would fight even if such an order were given, especially since 
the threat to Leopoldville has at least temporarily been reduced) 
fkammarskjold said that the Luluabourg episode was not a 
military victory for Stanleyville but that it did show the disintegra-
tion of the Congolese Army. He implied that a parallel situation 
is now shaping up in Equateur Province, where Stanleyville troops 
easily disarmed the garrison at Ikela and are now moving toward 
Coquilhatville, which is virtually unguarded by troops of the 
Leopoldville government because Mobutu has taken most of its 
garrison to the Bumba area. Press reports on 1 March say 
that Mobutu forces in Coquilhatville are defecting to GizengaZi 
.1ammarskjold also questioned where Mobutu stood in relation 
to recent events, pointing out that he was not particularly loyal 
to Kasavubu or Ileo, and that he had never broken'personally with 
Lumumba. The secretary general pointed out that Mobutu had 
started toward Stanleyville with "the most publicized--and 
slowest--military offensive in history" and then last week told 
UN Commander McKeown that he was taking up positions only 
for defense against infiltrators from Stanleyville. Hammarskjold

Peiping Announces New "100 Flowers" Campaign 
Where previously the slogan was "let politics take com-
mand;' the 28 February issue of Red Flag says that science 
and politics "are not the same thing" and that however help-
ful a correct world outlook may be, "Marxism-Leninism 
cannot replace actual study in the various branches of science." 
Scientific work, states Red Flag, must not merely repeat 
"successes achieved by our predecessors," but should strike 
out in new fields. The withdrawal of Soviet technicians last 
summer probably brought home to the Chinese the extent of 
their dependence on the USSR for scientific and technological 
information and their pressing need to expand their scientific 
capabilities. If a modicum of freedom of expression will help 
achieve this end, Peiping finds the risk worth taking. Red 
Flag rationalized the acknowledgment that non-Marxists can 
make valuable contributions to research by stating that such 
individuals "lean toward materialism" without knowing it. 
Peiping admits that the concept of "let 100 flowers bloom" 
may spill over from the academic into the political sphere but 
somewhat defensively states that "Marxists-Leninists are not 
afraid. . . because of that." In 1956-57 when Mao Tse-tung 
originated "100 flowers," the criticisms voiced by the intel-
lectuals obviously shook the leaders. Mao was termed "hot-
tempered, imprudent, reckless, and desiring to be a benev-
olent god." The anti-rightist campaign which followed saw the 
arrest and imprisonment of many intellectuals and the creation 
of a stultifying atmosphere in academic circles. Presumably 
neither the intellectuals nor the regime desires a repetition of 
the 1957 excesses.

Tito to Visit Latin America 
The Brazilian. ambassador in Belgrade was instructed on 
23 February to tell the Yugoslav foreign minister "that the 
new Brazilian administration is interested in increasing rela-
tions with Yugoslavia in all areas, political, economic, and 
cultural. . . . Proceed at once to make discreet inquiries on 
the reception which an official invitation for Marshal Tito would 
receive." The Brazilian ambassador reported a favorable Yugo-
slav reply on 25 February and advised that the matter "continue 
to be secret," but Foreign Minister Arinos has publicly suggested 
a Tito visit to Brazil. 
Quadros' invitation to Tito is intended to demonstrate the 
"truly independent" foreign policy he promised in his inaugural 
address on 31 January and during his campaign. Before the elec-
tion Quadros publicly expressed admiration for the independence 
of Tito and Nasir and during a pre-inauguration visit to Europe 
apparently hoped to arrange a meeting of neutralist leaders on 
the Yugoslav island of Brioni. 
Yugoslavia's first serious effort to broaden its economic 
and political relations with Latin America came in mid-1959 
when a Yugoslav cabinet officer led a good-will mission to seven 
Latin American capitals. Several months later, another high re-
gime official visited four other Latin American states, resulting 
in rumors that Tito would tour the area the following year. 
Yugoslavia's relations with the West are generally good; the 
West is Belgrade's primary source of developmental capital and 
provides roughly 65 percent of Yugoslavia's foreign trade. In 
January, Yugoslavia put into effect a foreign trade and exchange 
reform which brings its foreign trade practices into closer ac-
cord with those of the West. Tito has long wanted to make an 
official state visit to the United States, but his regime continues 
publicly to view the West as the chief villain in international af-
fairs. 
Tito is currently in Ghana, the first stop on a two-month 
African tour that will include official visits to Togo, Liberia, 
Guinea, Morocco, and Tunisia and an unofficial call on UAR

President Nasir. This is the third tour Tito has made to in-
crease Yugoslavia's ties with the uncommitted and underdevel-
oped countries; trips through the Middle and Far East were 
made in 1954-55 and 1958-59. Belgrade believes that close 
identification with the uncommitted states is its best defense 
against possible future political and economic pressure from 
East or West and the best possible platform from which to 
voice its views on international affairs. At the UN session 
last fall, the UAR's Nasir�long Yugoslavia's closest collab-
orator- Ghanat Nkrumah, Indonesia's Sukarno, and India's 
Nehru worked closely with Tito in an effort to ease East-
West tensions. Since then, Belgrade has advocated that the 
neutrals confer more often, collaborate more closely, and 
act in concert more frequently. 
In contrast to virtually nonexistent party-to-party rela-
tions, Belgrade has generally satisfactory relations with the 
Communist world at the state level, except for Albania and 
Communist China. Tito and Khrushchev held conversations 
in New York last falltOne result of which was an agreement 
to exchange visits by their foreign ministers3 Moscow and Bel-
grade hold similar views on most international issues, such as 
disarmament and colonialism. Albania and Communist China 
disapprove of close state _reaqtions_witlavia and maintain 
them at a minimal level.

Violence May Break Out in Ecuador Over the Cuban Issue  
Chiriboga told Ambassador Bernbaurn in early February 
that he was greatly concerned over the Ecuadorean political 
situation, and predicted another postponement of the eleventh 
Inter-American Conference now set for Quito on 24 May. He 
noted President Velasco's desire for closer relations with 
Cuba, his friendship for Araujo, and his refusal to take action 
against Communist or Cuban activities in Ecuador. 
The potential for violence over the Cuban issue was indi-
cated recently by Communist-backed student unrest in both 
Quito and Guayaquil which caused demonstrations against 
Chiriboga and the incumbent minister of government The 
Castro regime has cultivated relations with Velasco, particu-
larly by expressing support for Ecuador in its long-standing 
boundary dispute with Peru. 
Chiriboga also stated to an American official on 28 Febru-
ary that a military coup was being planned in Guayaquil. Such 
an attempt has been considered by a group of about 50 high-
ranking officers, under the leadership of the former army com-
mander, who were retired soon after Velasco was inaugurated 
last September. As minister of government, Araujo accused 
these officials of treason--a move which touched off a political 
controversy and helped precipitate his resignation. Although 
Velasco has a substantial following among the officer corps, he 
might alienate it if he reappoints Araujo to a top government 
position and follows a pro-Castro, pro-Soviet policy. Chiriboga 
said he had information that at a cabinet meeting last Saturday 
Velasco agreed to repudiate Araujo and threaten him with jail 
if he continued his activities; but Chiriboga also said he was 
certain Velasco will not follow through on this. 
Araujo recently spent about three weeks in Cuba, and he 
has reportedly maintained close contact with the Cuban Embassy 
in Quito. An advocate of close relations with the bloc, he pos-
ciblv contacted one or more bloc missions while in Havana.
