 Insidethe

 By Ste~re Lolr
 T WAS ABOUT 6:30 IN THE MORNING WHEN THE
 shooting started. On a jungle ridge dotted with coconut
 palms, more than 50 members of the New People's Army,
 the Communist rebels in the Philippines, were getting
 ready for breakfast at a makeshift camp in Sorsogon
 Province, some 290 miles southeast of Manila (map, page
 42). They had finished ahalf-hour of calisthenics and
 drills, and [he morning meat, wild cabbage stewed in
 coconut milk, and rice, was cooking. Here and there, the
 young guerrillas - an army without uniforms, wearing
 sneakers or barefoot -were attending to chores, clean-
 ing weapons, drying laundry and washing in a nearby
 stream.
 At the sound of gunfire, the piercing, staccato report of
 automatic rifles, the rebels took up their weapons and
 supplies, breaking camp hurriedly but without panic.
 The Government troops, apparently marine and army
 units, were getting closer. There were several brief exchanges of
 fire, with the guerrillas firing bursts from their M-16 assault rifles
 and then pulling back. Atone point, the military shot from as close as
 150 yards, and bullets creased a tree a few feet away.
 Then the rebels, hugging the ground and crouching behind palms,
 returned the fire in ear-splitting bursts. They fired their M-79 gre-
 nade launchers as well. The explosions sent the,Government troops
 scurrying for cover. The guemllas then broke into two groups and
 fled into the jungle, with the military in pursuit.
 A couple of days before, a New People's Army officer conceded

 that the Philippine armed forces had some well trained and profi-
 cient lighters, especially the marines and the army scout rangers.
 "But in the local areas, they are foreigners compared to us," he said.
 "So they are deaf and blind."
 His claim was put to the test that morning and afternoon, as the de-
 tachment of about two dozen rebels played acat-and-mouse game for
 the next six hours with the pursuing military. The escape traced a
 circuitous route over jungle terrain and across rivers and streams.
 Guerrilla scouts, equipped with hand-held radios, monitored the
 movements of the Government troops.
 Eventually, the rebels found a gap in the military's encircling
 maneuver and slipped through undetected. When one group of guer-
 rillas came upon the isolated bamboo-and-thatch but of a local farm-
 er, they found a welcome reception. There was water, handfuls of
 rice, and shelter for as long as the fleeing rebels wanted it. After the
 early exchanges, amounting to about 200 rounds, there was no more
 gunfire. In the N.P.A. unit I accompanied, there were no casualties
 that day.
 HE SHOOTOUT AND CHASE IN SOUTHEAST-
 ern Luzon was but one minor skirmish in the esca-
 lating warfare between Communist insurgents and
 the Government of Ferdinand E. Marcos, the en-
 during strongman of Southeast Asia who has ruled
 the Philippines for two decades. As recently as two
 years ago, the New People's Army was generally
 dismissed by the Philippine Government and for-
 eign analysts alike as nothing more than the latest
 version of the insurgent groups that, under various
 banners and ideologies, have come and gone for al-
 most four centuries on this 7,000-island archipela-
 go. But that complacency has been replaced by
 alarm as the Communist rebellion has grown rap-
 idly in the last couple of years, aided immeasura-
 bly by political and economic developments that
 have amplified the appeal of the radical alternative
 the guerrillas espouse.
 The August 1983 murder of the opposition leader Benigno S. Aquino
 Jr. at the Manila International Airport, as he returned from three
 years of self-imposed exile in the United States, seriously under-
 mined the credibility of the Marcos Government and the Philippine
 military, which has been implicated in the killing. Since then, the
 economy has plummeted, law and order have deteriorated and mili-
 taryabuses have continued.
 Washington, international lenders and the domestic opposition
 have all pressed Marcos to allow a revival of democratic institutions
 and to relax his strong hold on the nation's political and economic
 life. This message was reintorced in late October, when President
 Reagan sent Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada to meet with President
 Marcos in Manila. According to United States officials, Laxalt ex-
 pressed Reagan's "serious" concern over the situation in the coun-
 try, and urged Marcos to undertake urgent reforms.
 The 68-year-old president,  however,  still  retains  most of  his
 powers, including the authority to make laws by personal decree. His
 political opposition, weakened by internal rivalries, seems powerless
 to change that. And skepticism is widespread as to whether most op-
 position politicians genuinely want to change Philippine politics from
 being an exercise in personal enrichment or, as one businessman
 puu it, they just want to take "their turn at the trough." Today, it
 isn't unusual to hear lawyers, doctors and corporate executives
 admit privately that they are sympathizers of the N.P.A. because
 they regard it as "the only real alternative."

 violence, often amounting to the simple murder of government of-
 ficialsand other perceived enemies, is a central part of the N.P.A. al-
 ternative. Yet the use of such tactics seems to have gained increas-
 ing acceptance, even among many affluent Filipinos. "The violence
 is against my conscience," said a 42-year-old businessman who is a
 rebel sympathizer. "But in our circumstances, it is a way, a neces-
 saryevil, to reach a better end for this country."
 During the first half of this year, insurgency-related clashes left an
 average of 14 people killed every day, including soldiers, guerrillas,
 targeted government officials and innocent civilians caught in the
 crossfire. Once limited to small raids on isolated outposts, the rebels
 now regularly mount company-size and some battalion-scale opera-
 tions against fortified military facilities, usually to seize weapons,
 ammunition and equipment.
 The strength of the New People's Army is difficult to measure pre-
 cisely. Yet by all accounts it has thrived and expanded its activities
 considerably in the aftermath of the Aquino assassination. The Phi-
 lippine Government now places the rebel force ac 10,000 to 12,000 -
 about twice the estimate just a year ago. The Communists say they
 have more than 20,000 armed fighters.
 "The N.P.A. is winning -it's that simple," one Western military
 analyst said. "They aren't about to overthrow the Government now.
 But if the tide isn't turned over the next three to five years, the Com-
 munistscould be unstoppable."
 The growth of the N.P.A. insurgency represents the most serious
 challenge to American foreign policy in Southeast Asia since the mid-
 1970's. "The Philippines could become another Vietnam," warns Ste-
 phen J. Solari, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Asian and
 Pacific Affairs: "I doubt it would be another Vietnam in the sense of
 committing large numbers of American troops in the Philippines, buc
 it could be another country lost to Communism."
 The headcount of armed regulars in the New People's Army seri-
 ously understates the influence of the broader leftist movement of
 which the guerrillas are a part, known as the National Democratic
 Front. An umbrella group embracing various community, labor,
 church and other organizations, the :National  Democratic  Front
 claims to have a membership of one million and the support of 10 mil-
 lion Filipinos, out of a population of 54 million people. Its constituent
 organizations are committed to supporting the guerrilla warfare of
 the New People's Army and to a vaguely Marxist economic program
 calling for the nationalization of selected industrtes.
 The National Democratic Front advocates ananti-American for-
 eign policy, demanding the removal of the two large United States
 tilitary facilities here. Clark Air Base a~ the naval base at Subic
 Bay, and the expulsion of most American corporations. The two Phi-
 lippine bases are an essential part of United States military capabil-
 ities in Southeast Asia, and most analysts agree that their loss would
 be a major setback to American security interests. This concern has
 been heightened by the expansion of Soviet military activity in the re-
 gion, centered around the former American facilities at Cam Ranh
 Bay, Vietnam.
 Still, the leftist revolution gaining ground in the Philippines seems
 to be a home-grown phenomenon. It is a third-world nationalist
 movement preaching nonalignment, although critics point out that,
 as with the Sandinistas in Nicaragua and other rebel movements
 elsewhere in the third world, the N. P.A.'s true orientation may not be
 revealed until it has succeeded in gaining power. Its revolutionary
 ideology is borrowed from Marx, Lenin and Mao, but its leaders say
 they are adamantly opposed to falling under the imperialistic sway
 of any superpower. Moving into the Soviet orbit, they insist, will
 never be a part of their program.
 According to State Department officials, there is no evidence of
 "material" support tmm foreign governments. However, there is
 evidence, they say, of financial support from sympathetic leftist
 groups, mostly in Europe. The biggest sources of funds, according to
 these officials, are organizations in the Eastern bloc, Scandinavia
 and West Germany. Where those groups, in turn, get their money is
 unknown- leaving open the possibility of indirect Soviet financing.
 The Philippine revolutionaries appear to be skittish about direct
 Soviet support, in part because N.P.A. leaders believe that any overt
 connections linking their group to Moscow would invite American in-
 tervention in the Philippines. And Chinese support of the N.P.A. is
 unlikely, State Department officials say, because the Chinese seem

 TODAY,  THE  NEW
 People's Army is ac-
 tive in nearly all of the
 country's 73 provinces. West-
 ernanalystsestimate that the
 N.P.A. etiectively controls 20
 percent or more of the vil-
 lages,  or  barrios,  in  the
 Philippines. The Marcos Gov-
 ernment  claims  such  esti-
 mates are exaggerated. But
 barrio  residents,  business-
 men and hacienda managers
 in  some  areas  of  N.P.A.
 strength report that the per-
 centage is far higher, with
 Communist shadow govern-
 ments, called Barrio Revolu-
 tionary Councils, controlling
 as much as 50 percent of the
 barrios in many towns.
 The group's members are
 young, 19 or 20 years old, on
 average. Judging from inter-
 views with more than two
 dozen N.P.A. fighters in three
 different units in southeast-
 ern Luzon, most are the sons
 and daughters  of  impover-
 ished  tenant  farmers.  The
 majority never finished high
 school. Without the alterna-
 tive offered by the New Pea
 pie's Army, they faced the
 same fate as their parents,
 working long hours to scrape
 a subsistence from the coco-
 nut stands they farm. They
 are the underclass in a feudal
 agrarian world of two classes
 -the hacienderos and the
 tenants.
 The hacienderos, or land-
 lords, frequently live in Mani-
 la, and their farms are run by
 hired supervisors. The ten-
 ants work the land, but the
 hacienderos take most of the
 crop, with the tenants making
 do with what is left. It is
 enough for adirt-floor dwell-
 ing of a couple of rooms with
 no plumbing. If there is elec-
 tricity, it is typically supplied
 by a car battery wired to a
 naked lightbulb or two.
 N.P.A. fighters speak of the ~,
 injustice of Philippine soci-
 ety, and they defend their
 movement as an attempt to
 improve the lives of disad-
 vantaged tenant farmers like
 their relatives and neighbors.
 But few of them talk of the
 other two main elements in
 N.P.A. doctrine - opposing
 imperialism  and  "bureau-
 crat" capitalism.
 the Tagalog word for com-
 rade or companion; a first
 name or Filipino niclmame
 follows. Ka Nestor, a 2>l-year-
 old who became a guerrilla
 seven  years as[o. conceded
 that his early knowledge of
 the group's doctrine was lim-
 ited.  "In  truth,"  he  said,
 "when I joined I did not really
 understand the objectives of
 the movement. I had only a
 general idea that this was for
 the good of the people. "
 Nineteen-year-old          I{a
 Andy, a veteran N.P.A. guer-
 rilla who bears the scars of
 seven bullet wounds suNered '.
 in battle, is now a member of !!
 an N.P.A. "sparrow squad,"
 which specializes in assassi-
 nations of local officials and
 military  officers.  "I  don't
 Prot anymore," he says, in a
 statement typical  of  many
 N.P.A.  fighters,  mast  of
 whom, like 85 percent of Fili-
 pinos, were raised as Roman
 Catholics. "I don't believe in
 God anymore. The N.P.A. is
 my family now and the move-
 menc is my religion."
 To its members and to the
 local communities where it is
 strong, the N.P.A. has sold it-
 self as a kind of "social po-
 lice." It maintains peace and
 order, administers its brand
 of  rough  justice,  collects
 taxes and carries out its ver-
 sion of agrarian reform. In
 the N.P.A. program of land
 reform. the traditional crop-
 sharing arrangement on ten-
 ant farms, which gives the
 landlord two thirds of the
 crop a~ the tenant one third,
 is reversed.
 There have been signs that
 once the N.P.A. is powerful in
 an area, it tends to abandon
 its "Robin Hood" image and
 use force to extort funds from
 villagers  and  gain  support
 through coercion. Yet for the
 most part, the N.P.A. is still
 widely perceived as a benevo-
 lent organization, performing
 tasks for the community that
 the Government should but
 does not.
 This  image  has  imbued
 most of the rebels with a sin-
 cere belief in the righteous-
 ness of  their  revolutionary
 movement, despite the via
 lence and hardship the guer-
 rilla life involves. The N.P.A.
 preaches abstinence and dis-
 cipline. Drinking is banned.
 There are strict rules guiding
 courtship   (including   the
 pointed  suggestion  not  to
 marry  outside  the  move-
 ment). Premarital sex is out-
 lawed.
 Like soldiers in any army,
 the  N.P.A.  fighters  have
 lengthy  periods  of  empty
 time. They fill it playing vol-
 leyball,  telling  stories  and
 jokes, strumming guitars and
 singing. All activities seem to
 include people in groups of
 three or four or more. Few in-
 dividuals are left to them-
 selves. Asked what she liked
 about being a member of the
 N.P.A., I{a Totoy, a 21-year-
 old guerrilla, replies:  "The
 principles, the discipline and
 the camaraderie. "
 The rebel movement,  for
 security reasons, is intention-
 ally vague about its com-
 mend structure. both at the
 national and regional levels.
 Two former campus activists
 at the prestigious University
 of the Philippines in Manila,
 Rodolfo  Sales  and  Rafael
 Baylosis,  are  identified  by
 Government  authorities  as
 the chairman and secretary
 general of the  party.  For
 their part, the guerrillas will
 not identity anyone by title,
 except  to  say  someone  is
 "senior member" or a "re-
 sponsible  officer"  in  the
 N.P.A.
 THE   SLIGHT   36_
 year-0!d man, with a
 pencil-thin  mustache
 and  heavy-lidded  eyes,  is
 known as 1{a Oggie. He is one
 of the most senior members
 of the N.P.A. in the Bicol re-
 gion, or nationally, for that
 matter. An anti-Government
 activist in Manila, he joined
 the rebels in the hills in early
 1970.  That  was  15  months
 after  11  young  revolution-
 aries, in a split with the inef-
 fectual, Soviet-0riented Huk-
 balahap   rebel   group,   formally
 created the Communist Party of the
 Philippines, on Dec. 26,  1968.  The
 young radicals pledged to re-establish
 the party "guided by Marxism-Lenin-
 ism-Mao Zedong thought." In keeping

 the party controls the gun," the New
 People's Army, the party's military
 wing, was established on March 29,
 1~ -one year before Ka Oggie
 joined up.
 Seated on the floor of a tenant farm-
 er's dwelling one night, smoking and
 speaking by the light of a kerosene
 lamp, Ka Oggie said that the N.P.A.'s
 first decade had been marked by mis-
 takes and setbacks. The group's ideo-
 logical fervor did not translate into
 combat  effectiveness.  "We  didn't
 know anything about waging a war,"
 the rebel veteran said, ' `and we had to
 learn with many lives, unfortunate-
 ~   In  the  1970's,  the  movement's
 agrarian reform was more radical
 than the current program, and mis-
 takenly so, in the view of today"s
 rebel leaders. "It was 90 percent for
 the tenant and 10 percent for the land-
 lord," ICa Oggie said. "If the landlord
 did not accept, there was confisca-
 tion. That extreme approach lost us
 the support of the middle forces -
 landlords and small-business  men.
 Now, we recognize that we need their
 support."
 Indeed, the N.P.A.'s ability to re-
 cover  from  its  early  setbacks  is
 largely attributable to its flexibility.
 It has adapted Communist revolution-
 ary theory to Philippine conditions,
 broadening its support.
 Militarily, the party has also fash-
 ioned aFilipino variant of the Maoist
 model, tailored to the nation's geogra-
 phy. The blueprint for its brand of
 guerrilla warfare was presented in a
 1974 tract entitled "Specific Charac-
 teristics of Our People's War," by
 Amado Guerrero, thought to be a pen
 name for Josh Maria Sison, a founder
 and first chairman of the Communist
 Party of the Philippines.
 "In a small, fragmented country
 like   the   Philippines,"   Guerrero
 wrote, "it would be foolhardy for the
 central leadership to ensconce itself
 in one limited area." Instead, he de-
 clared, the  N.P.A. should set up a
 series  of  decentralized  "guerrilla
 fronts," each spanning several adja-
 cent towns and villages and including
 a party organ, an N.P.A. unit and a
 network of civilian organizations sup-
 porting the revolutionary movement.
 At present, the rebels claim to have
 more Wan 60 such fronts scattered
 across the country.
 Building  popular  support  is  the
 foremost consideration of We revolu-
 tionary   movement,   I{a   Oggie
 stressed: "We are doing Wings in We
 countryside that any decent govern-
 mentought to be doing -helping poor
 people meet their basic needs and giv-
 ing them justice."
 into an empty glass," he continued.
 "We give them something, while the
 government gives them nothing."
 Government officials dismiss
 claims as self-serving romanticism.
 The N.P.A.,  President Marcos as-
 serts, is less concerned with improv-
 ing life in the Philippines than with
 justifying the actions of a member-
 ship that is made up largely of "plain
 criminals,  local bandits, or bored
 young people seeking adventure."
 The movement's foreign policy is
 still developing. At this juncture, it
 seems to be a leftist amalgam of na-
 tionalism, Marxism and opportun-
 ism. According to the Communists
 and the members of  the National
 Democratic Front, their objection to
 the American military bases in the
 Philippines is primarily nationalistic.
 They don't want any foreign bases in
 the country, they say, adding
 that the Philippines should be
 a neutral, nonaligned nation.
 Yet the June 1985 edition of
 Ang Bayan, the underground
 publication of the Communist
 Party of the Philippines, de-
 clared: "It is the duty of the
 Filipino people to forge links
 of solidarity with the other
 peoples  of  the  world.  Our
 principal enemy is U.S. im-
 perialism, which is also the
 principal enemy of the peo-
 ples of the world."
 Virtually every observer of
 the   Philippine   guerrilla
 movement       is   watching
 closely for signs of outside
 sponsorship,  but  the  Phi-
 lippine military says it has
 not yet found evidence of sup-
 port from any foreign govern-
 ment.
 For his part, Ka Oggie, the
 Bicol guerrilla officer, says
 that the rebels want the back-
 ing of governments that are
 "friends of our revolution,"
 though he declined to name
 any candidates. "It will be
 difficult to win without for-
 eignsupport," he admits. The
 overseas  backing  that  the
 N.P.A. needs, he says, woWd
 be  mainly  weapons  ship-
 ments, including artillery. So
 far,  We  rebels'  arms  are
 mainly high-powered rifles,
 with M-16's by far We most
 common. They also have.car-
 bines,  and  some  machine
 guns and grenade launchers.
 Much  of  what  Wey  carry
 bears the legend "property of
 U.S. Government" or "U.S.
 Army," having been seized
 from the Philippine military
 in ambushes or, occasionally,
 purchased from corrupt offi-
 cers.
 To  benefit  from  foreign
 backing, Ka Oggie said, the
 Philippine  guerrillas  must
 first increase their strength
 enough to control large sec-
 tions of the nation's shoreline
 so that weapons shipments
 can land easily. The N.P.A.
 should reach that threshold in
 "a couple of years," he fig-
 ures.
 TALL,  LEAN,  WITH
 close-croPP~   g='aY
 hair, Col. Rodolto Bla-
 zon stands at the forefront of
 the Philippine Government's
 effort to stem the growth of
 the Communist insurgency.
 The 50-year-0ld marine cow-
 wander heads the counterin-
 surgency drive in the area
 around Davao, the sprawling
 port  city  of  Mindanao.  In
 Davao,  the  New  People's
 Army is so active with its or-
 ganizing, tax collections and
 selective liquidations of Po-
 lice and other officials that
 Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile
 has called the city a "laboratory for
 the N.P.A." It is Blazon's job to make
 sure that the Communist experiment
 i   in Davao and the surrounding coun-
 tryside is not a success.
 Following the declaration of mar-
 tial law in 1972, the Philippine mili-
 tary acquired a reputation for being
 corrupt, abusive and top-heavy with
 officers personally close to President
 Marcos. Blazon epitomizes the other
 side of the military -the professional
 soldiers. He is a graduate of the Phi-
 lippine Military Academy, which is
 modeled after West Point. He is intel-
 ligent, articulate and respected both
 by supporters of the Government and
 by its strident critics. The marines
 under his command are also highly
 regarded in the community. They are
 disciplined,  well  trained  and  well
 equipped troops.
 Blazon commands military sweeps
 in the hills surrounding Davao to cap-
 ture guerrilla uniu, but he spends
 most of his time talking to civilians,
 usually in small groups. He talks to
 students, local businessmen, opposi-
 tion politicians, anybody who will lis-
 ten. "The military side of the N.P.A.
 is often overstated,"  Blazon says.

 "The real danger is their teach-ins,
 their so-called education program,
 ~   That is what I work to counteract, and
 i   that's where the main counterinsur-
 gency battle. has to be fought and
 won."
 "This  insurgency  problem,"  he
 went on, ' `is not going to be solved by
 body counts. The important thing is to
 change the thinking of the people.
 They have to be convinced that their
 grievances against the Government
 may be temporary and that Commu-
 nism is the real enemy."
 Blazon views himself as a kind of
 evangelist. In his lectures, he sides
 with institutions, not personalities. "I
 teach for democracy and against
 Communism,.' he explains. "I don't
 promote the Government." At times,
 in fact, he sounds like an opposition
 politician: "If you take away the op-
 position groups, you have a dictator-
 ship. They are the alternative for a
 peaceful change. We need them." To
 the opposition, his admonition is to be-
 ware of the "danger of Communist in-
 filtration" - a warning he presents
 as the lesson of the Nicaraguan revo-
 lution.
 During the last year, more than 20
 barrios in Davao that were once heav-
 ily influenced by the Communists
 have been returned to Government
 control, thanks to the coun-
 terinsurgency campaign. But
 in some of these, the marines '
 are nothing more than an oc-
 cupying force, and the civil-
 ian population is neutralized.
 "If the marines are there, the
 villagers   support   them,"
 noted  Prospero  Nograles, a
 Davao human-rights lawyer.
 "But if the N.P.A. comes in,
 they  will  cooperate  with
 them."
 Another important factor is
 the  presence  of  less-disci-
 plined Government troops in
 the area. The marines under
 Blazon account for only about
 one third of the regular mili-
 tary troops in the area. These
 9,500 regulars are  far out-
 numbered by the 7,000-strong
 contingent of the paramili-
 tary civilian home detense
 force.  Poorly  paid,  badly
 equipped and often undisci-
 plined, these units occupy the
 lowest rung of the Philippine
 military. They are known as
 trigger-happy bad boys who
 are  frequently  little  more
 than guns-tor-hire, and whose
 side businesses include theft
 and extortion. So, though Bla-
 zon and his charges are im-
 pressive and respected, they
 are twt the face of the mili-
 tarythat most people see.
 HE N.P.A.'S STRUG-
 gle has been promoted
 by it followers not as a
 coming Communist takeover,
 but as a nationalist revolu-
 tion. The nationalist theme
 has  broad  appeal in  the
 Philippines,  which  was  a
 Spanish  colony  for  nearly
 four centuries and then, from
 1898 to 1996, was controlled by
 the United States, except for
 the Japanese occupation dur-
 ing World War II. In their
 small-group   indoctrination
 sessions, the leftists rarely
 mention the word "commu-
 nism." In fact, many full-
 time members of the move-
 ment, including some in the
 armed units, insist they are
 not Communists, but merely
 part of the National Demo-
 cratic Front.
 Whether this is a distinction
 with a difference is dubious.
 In ideological terms, the Phi-
 lippine Communist Party and
 the   National   Democratic
 Front are virtually indistin-
 guishable, blaming  "Amer-
 ican imperialism" for most of
 the problems in their country
 and elsewhere, and advocat-
 ing the necessity of armed re-
 bellion.
 Still,  many  middle-class
 Filipinos who support the left_
 ist cause do not believe they
 are  backing  Communism
 and, perhaps naively, do not
 believe that their business in-
 terests and property will be
 taken hum them if the rebels
 win.  A  38-year-old  lawyer
 who is a landowner in south-
 ern  Luzon  says:  "I  don't
 think this will be a Commu-
 nist country, even after the
 revolutionary   movement
 takes  over.  It  is  because
 democracy  has   been  sub-
 verted in this country that I
 support  this  revolutionary
 movement."
 Even some longtime party
 members explain the Com-
 munist element in the move-
 ment more in terms of prag-
 matism than as an unshak-
 able faith in Communist doc-
 trine. I{a Cesar, a rugged 35-
 year-old with a stocky phy-
 sique, is a senior party cadre
 ~ in  the  Bicol region.  At the
 home of a large landowner
 sympathetic  to  the  move-
 ment, he said: "We believe
 that radical change is needed
 in this country, and we need
 an ideology.  We have seen
 that the Marx-Lenin-Mao ap-
 proach has been effective in
 waging and winning revolu-
 tionary   struggles   else-
 where.,
 "But," he continued, "that
 doesn't mean it will have that
 character here. We are open
 to all elements of other ideolo-
 glee as long as they help us
 win..,
 Yet many Filipinos wonder
 whether the movement's tac-
 tics as it strains to increase
 its base of popular support
 are only that -tactics, to be
 cast aside as its strength in-
 creases. This kind of reserva-
 tion  is  frequently  heard
 among other opponents of the
 'Marcos  Government,  espe-
 ciallymoderates seeking non-
 violentchange.
 One of these is Jaime V.
 Ongpin,  a  Harvard-trained
 corporate   executive         in
 Manila and a persistent critic
 of the Marcos Government.
 In Ongpin's view, the growth
 of the New People's Army is
 largely a symptom of the na-
 tion's problems - an authori-
 tarian regime, a bloated and
 abusive military and a pros-
 trate economy riddled with
 corruption  and  favoritism.
 The communist insurgency,
 he believes, will wither away
 if the Philippines gets rid of
 Marcos and then sets about
 the tasks of reviving demo-
 cratic  institutions  and  re-
 forming the military and the
 economy.
 "The rise of the N.P.A. is
 alarming but not overpower-
 ing," Ongpin says. "There is
 still time. Ninety percent of
 the guerrillas are not com-
 mitted  to  the  Communist
 ideology. They are just peo-
 pie reacting to circumstances
 -  poverty  and  military
 abuses. At present, with Mar-
 cus's  power,  they  are  not
 given a decent alternative to
 joining the N.P.A.  But the
 Filipino is not a Bolshevik. He
 doesn't want that much. He
 wants to be left alone, to earn
 a  decent  living  and  have
 enough to send his kids to
 school. "
 Ongpin may not want Com-
 munism  in  the  Philippines
 but, like a growing number of
 moderates, he doesn't want
 the American military bases
 in the Philippines either. Ong-
 pin favors the departure of
 the American presence as a
 pragmatic  nationalist:   he
 does not think the bases serve
 the Philippines. And asked if
 he would stay in the Philip-
 pines  if  the  nation  turned
 Communist, he replies: "Yes
 I would. I am Filipino and
 this is my country, regard-
 less." ^
