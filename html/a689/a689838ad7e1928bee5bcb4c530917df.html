 DCI BRIEFING FOY.
 DISARMAMENT SUBCOMMITTEE,
 SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS
 I.   I understand you wish me to discuss today the
 military threat posed by the Soviet Union and
 Communist China, touching on the related eco-
 nomic and political considerations.
 A.    I propose to give you the general thrust
 of the present situation and probable
 future trends.
 B.    As you know, we could easily spend a full
 day on the detailed strength and hardware
 of the Russian and Chinese military establish-
 ments.
 C.    I feel it will be more useful to present an
 over-all picture,  after which we can go into
 any details you may wish on the basis of your
 questions.

 1.   The new Soviet ICBMs--which we call the third
 generation--are coming into operational status
 now at a rapid rate.
 A.    At this time last year,  the count had been
 stable at about 225 for a good year and a
 half .
 1.   The Soviets at that point had completed
 their deployment of the first- and second-
 generation missiles.
 2.   In 1964, however,  they began their new
 program, comprising two new missile sys-
 tems.
 B.    One of these, we call the SS-9.   It is a large
 and accurate missile which can carry
 warhead 5,000 miles, or
 warhead about 7,000 miles.
 ?
 C.    The other,    the SS-11,  is less accurate and smaller.
 We estimate the maximum yield of its warhead at
 II.    The silos for these new ICBMs become operational,
 at present rate of construction,  two years or a
 little more after they are started.   As a result,

 the estimated number of operational launchers
 has already moved up from that plateau of 225
 to about 385.
 A.   Our current National Intelligence Estimate
 concludes that by the middle of this year
 the Soviet Union will have about 425 to 485
 ICBMs ready to launch.   By mid-1968, the figure
 should be 670 to 765.

 B.   A-: longer range, we estimate that the Soviet
 ICBM force will have somewhere between 800
 and 1,100 operational launchers four years
 from now, in mid-1971 to be specific.
 III.    The numbers, however, do not tell the whole story.
 The present deployment is also changing the char-
 acter of the Soviet ICBM force.

 A.      First,  it is going to be harder to knock out.
 All of the new launchers are in hardened

 silos,
 at the 'existi-ng'-missi.le._complexes
 B.      Secondly, the main emphasis of the new deploy-
 ment is on the SS-11 system.   By mid-1968,  there
 may be as many as 400 of these, making up more
 than half of the Soviet force.
 1.   The SS-9 system has the accuracy and the
 big warhead needed to attack hardened mili-
 tary targets.
 2.   In contrast,  the SS-11, with less accuracy
 and a much smaller warhead yield,  is more

 ?
 suitable for large, soft targets.   In
 other words,  it is a "city-buster."
 C.   The Soviets, by putting their missile force
 in silos and concentrating on the SS-11,
 are working for what we call "assured
 destruction"--that is, the capability to
 destroy a significant portion of the
 population and resources of the United
 States even if U.S. missiles should strike
 first.
 IV.    This improvement of strategic attack capabilities
 is bound to give the Soviet leaders greatly
 increased confidence that they have achieved
 a sufficient "assured destruction" capability
 to serve as a deterrent..
 A.    We do not believe, however,  that between
 now and the mid-1970s the Soviets
 themselves expect to be strong enough to
 consider the deliberate initiation of a
 war against the United States.
 V.   Let me review briefly the status of the
 remainder of the Soviet capability for strategic
 attack.

 MRBM/IR&3M
 A.            There have been no major changes during the
 ~)ast year in the Soviet Intermediate-range
 and Medium-range ballistic missile force.
 1.   There are about 100 intermediate and 600
 medium-range operational launchers.
 2.   About 90 percent of the sites are  in  the
 Western USSR,  constituting a massive
 threat to Europe.
 3.   We do not expect much change over the
 next 10 years in the size of the MRBM/
 IRBM force, but again,  the character will
 probably change.
 4.   As the existing systems become obsolescent,
 launchers on soft pads will be phased out.
 Present research and development also sug-
 gests that the Soviets are working for
 mobile systems, and solid fuel.   They ...ave
 paraded prototypes of mobile missiles,  in-
 cluding one which they called a mobile
 ICBM,  and they have tested a solid-fueled
 missile to about 3,000 miles, which is
 right on the borderline between Inter-
 mediate and Intercontinental range.

 B.   The Soviet submarine force has a growing mis-
 sile capability.
 1.    A nuclear-powered submarine now under con-
 struction is the first unit of a new class
 which will apparently carry eight or more
 tubes for submerged launch of a new missile
 with a range of 1,000 to 2,000 miles.
 2.    A few operational submarines have been con-
 verted to fire a 700-mile ballistic missile
 while submerged.
 3.    The rest of the missile units have to
 launch from the surface.
 4.    There are 36 submarines, with about 100
 launchers altogether,  for ballistic missiles.
 Most of these missiles have a range of 350
 miles.
 5.    Another 47 submarines carry a total of about
 250 cruise missiles, with the primary mission
 of attacking naval task forces.   Their mis-
 sile has a range of about 450 miles.
 6.    About 45 of the 360 Soviet submarines are
 nuclear-powered.   The power plants are
 noisier than ours,

 Long Range Aviation
 ?
 ?
 C.            As for strategic air threat,  Soviet Long Range
 Aviation now consists of 950 to 1,000 bomber
 and tanker aircraft.   The number is declining
 slowly, and there has been no evidence of any
 new Soviet heavy bomber program.
 1.   The Soviets have about 200 heavy bombers,
 some of which are used as tankers.   We es-
 timate that they could mount a strike of
 about 100 aircraft on two-way missions
 against the United States.
 2.   The rest of Long Range Aviation consists
 of medium-range aircraft,  featuring the
 super-sonic-dash BLINDER medium bomber.
 We expect the mediums would be used
 primarily to attack U.S.  and allied tar-
 gets on the Eurasian landmass.
 3.    The Air Force,  however,  has two major res-
 ervationsu                        One is the Air
 Force belief that Long Range Aviation is
 likely to have a new heavy bomber in the
 next few years.   The other is the Air Force

 calculation that in all-out war, 300
 medium bombers could be used to supple-
 ment the 100 heavies in an attack on
 targets in the United States.
 4.   The Soviets have developed air-to-surface
 missiles to extend the operational use-

 manned aircraft.   They
 appear to be having trouble, however,
 with the missile designed for the BLINDER.
 The principal operational missile at
 present delivers a nuclear warhead about
 350 miles, with a terminal speed approach-
 ing twice the speed of sound.

 SOVIET STRATEGIC DEFENSE
 ?
 ?
 I.   The status of Soviet strategic defense is the
 subject of a sharp difference of opinion in the
 intelligence community over Soviet anti-missile
 capability.   So that we can have a clear under-
 standing of the controversy,  let me point out
 that it involves two separate missile systems.
 Moscow System
 A.   First,  around Moscow the Soviets are indeed
 deploying an array of missiles and radars
 conclusively demonstrated to be an ABM system.
 B.   Part of the system should be ready to go this
 year,  and the entire complex by about 1970.
 C.   When it is finished,  Moscow will be protected
 by about 100 solid-fuel missiles that can
 reach out several hundred miles and explode
 a. nuclear warhead above the atmosphere.
 .1.  We think the system would have a good
 capability against a limited number of
 existing missiles,  but it doesn't have
 what it takes to cope with a major attack,
 or with the penetration aids that incoming
 missiles will have in the future.

 The intelligence community is agreed on
 this evaluation of the Moscow system.
 D.   The system starts with early warning radars
 in northwestern Russia that cover the avenues
 of approach for missiles coming from the con-
 i;inental United States.   They can probably
 detect a missile as much as
 ?
 1.    These radars)
 should be operational this year or early
 in 1968.
 E.   Nearer Moscow,  there is a big radar which
 acquires the incoming missile from the
 early warning facilities,  tracks it, and
 F.   Finally, at a dozen sites forming a ring
 about 50 miles from the center of Moscow, are
 the engagement radars, which aim the missiles
 on  their nearby launchers and track them to
 the target.
 G.   We have recently calculated that this system
 including all of the radars but not the
 developing and testing--will have cost the
 Soviets the equivalent of about three billion

 U.S. dollars,  from the start of construc-
 tion through 1970.
 H.   This system I have just described is unique
 to Moscow.   You only have to think for a
 minute about what Moscow has meant in Rus-
 sian history to realize that the Soviets will
 defend Moscow with any system that might help,
 regardless of cost, effectiveness, or feasi-
 bility.
 1.    We have seen no indication that this
 system is going to show up anywhere else
 in the Soviet Union.
 Tallinn System
 II.  Now let's leave Moscow to look at another defen-
 sive missile deployment.   This one is being de-
 ployed extensively.   We call it the Tallinn system
 after the city in Estonia where the first such
 com-olex was built. The Tallinn system is the
 object of the controversy I have mentioned, be-
 cause so far there just isn't enough hard evidence
 to be positive of its purpose.
 A.   CIA believes that this system is more likely
 to be a defense against high-flying,  high-
 speed aircraft and other aerodynamic vehicles.

 B.     The other view is that the weapon is basically
 an antiballistic missile, with a secondary
 mission against aerodynamic vehicles.   This
 is the view of DIA,  the Army, and the Air Force.

 III.   So far we have evidence of 26 complexes for the
 Tallinn system.   The deployment pattern forms a
 forward defense across the northwestern Soviet
 Union, with others situated for local defense of
 specific targets.
 A. We think that more than 20 of these complexes
 can be operational this year.   At the present
 pace of deployment, the Soviet Union could
 have about 75 of them by 1972.
 :L.       Most of the complexes have three sites,
 with six launchers at each site.   The 26
 complexes now under construction will ap-
 parently have a total of about 550 launchers.
 B. On the basis of the evidence we have, we be-
 lieve the Tallinn system missile will probably

 ea-determi-oe, some of the Tallinn system
 locations do not have the early warning and
 long-range radar coverage that an effective
 ABM system would have to have.
 Other Air Defense
 IV.   The rest of the Soviet strategic defense picture
 is relatively static.
 A.    New jet fighter aircraft which are now be-
 coming operational will give the Soviet Union
 improved all-weather capability, and greater
 ir. terceptor range.
 B.    There are about 1,000 sites in the Soviet
 Union for the SA-2 surface-to-air missile
 system.   Performance in North Vietnam has not
 been particularly impressive--more than 1,500
 missiles have been fired to bring down a maximum

 C.      The SA-3 system is supposed to be more effec-
 tive at low altitudes,  but the Soviets have
 deployed it to only about 110 sites in the
 Soviet Union.   This suggests that it has not
 come up to expectations.

 I.     About two thirds of Soviet military manpower--
 some 2 million men--are in what we call general
 purposes forces: the ground forces, tactical air,
 and tactical navy.
 A.   The number of divisions has remained fairly
 constant.   There are 109 divisions almost
 completely equipped and ready for early com-
 mitment to battle.
 1.   Their manning ranges from about 60 per-
 cent of wartime levels in the Soviet
 interior, to 90 percent  in Eastern Europe.
 2.   Another 32 cadre divisions have only about
 20 percent of full strength.
 B.    Tae Soviets are gradually but steadily improv-
 ing the ground forces weapons.
 C.    T.aey are also making a start in developing
 strike forces which they could use for action
 at distant points--a Soviet shortcoming until
 now.
 1.   Airlift is being improved,  a marine corps
 has been created, and there has been an
 increase in airborne and amphibious
 maneuvers.

 D.     The Soviets continue to help the moderniza-
 tion and improvement of the East European
 satellite forces.   The East Europeans can
 now contribute about one million men in 42
 divisions for Warsaw Pact needs.

 1.   For this shot,  the Soviets reactivated
 their test site at Novaya Zemlya in the
 western arctic.   Novaya Zemlya was the
 location of many of the U.S.S.R.'s
 earlier explosions in the atmosphere,
 but had not been used for underground

 series,

 D.   Last September 30,  the Soviets used a nuclear
 explosion to put  out a fire which had been
 burning at a natural gas well for several years.

 of the Urals,  in 1965, and at Azgir,  north of
 the Caspian,  in 1966,

 1. The Soviet economy continues to have problems,
 notably with the allocation of critical re-
 sources,.    ver,, the next few years we do not
 expect that`Soviet Gross National Product will
 match the performance of the 1950's.
 A.   The Soviet GNP and total Soviet industrial
 production are each a little less than half
 of ours.
 B.   Nevertheless,  the Soviet Union virtually
 matches our defense effort, mainly because
 the Soviet consumer is way down in the peck-
 ing order when it comes to allocating output.
 C.   Military and space spending remained fairly
 constant between 1962 and 1965, but we es-
 timate that outlays in 1966 were up about 7
 :percent.
 1.   The state budget for 1967 includes an
 admitted increase of 1.1 billion rubles
 for defense,  and hidden allocations else-
 where in the budget may make the actual
 increase considerably bigger.
 D.    For our purposes today,  let me just say that
 we conclude that the Soviet economy will come

 1.   In the Kremlin today,  the General Secretary of
 the Party, Leonid Brezhnev, seems to have the
 most important voice in making key assignments,
 and he is getting more and more of the spotlight.
 A.   The Soviet leadership, however, was brought
 into power in reaction to Khrushchev's erratic
 personal leadership, and it is still function-
 ing by and large as a collective government.
 B.   That means that it is a relatively cautious
 government, not given to radical departures
 from established policies and procedures.
 C.   The present leadership stands better with
 the military, as far as we can judge, and
 this is largely because it has dropped
 K:rushchev's attempts to cut back on mili-
 tary spending.
 II.    Domestic pre-occupation centers on the economy.
 It has been so hard to reach decisions on resource
 allocations,  that the Soviets are in the second
 year of their present Five Year Plan, and the Plan
 itself hasn't received final approval yet.
 III.    In foreign affairs,  the overriding concern right
 now is the dispute with Communist China.

 A.    Tension between Moscow and Peking has in-
 tensified markedly in recent months.   The
 Soviets feel they have gotten the upper
 )land in the world Communist movement, and
 they are beginning to behave somewhat more
 boldly.
 1.   For instance,  they are again trying to
 convoke an international meeting to
 condemn the Chinese.
 The Soviets have exploited Peking's re-
 jection of appeals for united Communist
 action in support of North Vietnam.
 3.   Peking's retort has been that Moscow is
 secretly conspiring with the United States
 against the Asian Communists.
 4.   Moscow,  to avoid giving any substance to
 the Chinese charges, has been taking the
 line publicly that there can be little
 advance in U.S.-Soviet relations until
 the Vietnam conflict is settled.
 B.    The Kremlin has made it clear in private,
 however,  that the Soviet Union wants to keep
 lines of communication with Washington open,
 o.espite the strains and constraints imposed

 by the Vietnamese fighting and sensitivity
 to charges of Soviet-U.S. collusion.
 1.    If it weren't for Vietnam,  the Soviet
 leaders would probably prefer to resume
 the dialogue with Washington on matters
 which are of greater concern to Soviet
 national interests,  such as European
 security, arms control,  and East-West
 trade.
 2.    The agreements recently reached on civil
 air routes and the peaceful use of outer
 space showed that limited cooperation is
 still possible.

 CHINESE COMMUNIST ADVANCED WEAPONS
 I.        The Chinese Communists are making a concerted
 effort--on their own and with overriding priori-
 ties--to develop modern weapons for strategic
 attack.   They are devoting increasing resources
 to missiles and nuclear weapons.
 B.    They are,  therefore, making progress toward
 a nuclear strike capability.
 C.    We estimate that they could begin to deploy
 a medium-range ballistic missile with a
 nuclear warhead this year, and their first
 crude ICBMs in the early 1970s.
 II.      The fourth Chinese nuclear test was a device
 detonated near Lop Nor on October 26.   The Chi-
 nese claim it was delivered by ballistic missile.
 A.    As nearly as we can ascertain,  the claim is
 probably true.
 B.    The vehicle was probably a Soviet-model,:",

 much nearer -the detomat ?-gym ,
 B.       The tests indicate that the Chinese can
 manufacture nuclear bombs which can be car-
 ried by their medium bombers--about a dozen
 old TU-4 BULLs similar to our B-29, and two
 TU-16 BADGER jet bombers.

 2.     Their likely immediate goals, however,
 are probably warheads for short- and
 medium-range missiles, and possibly a
 weapon for the IL-28 BEAGLE light jet
 bomber.   The Chinese have about 250 of
 these aircraft, which have a better
 chance of reaching a defended target
 than the BULLs.
 C.     In the present state of Chinese technology,
 any weapons they might make now would be
 crude and inefficient by our standards.   By
 Far Eastern standards, however,  they are a
 significant addition to Chinese military
 prestige.
 IV.     The Chinese probably started their missile de-
 velopment by test-firing Soviet MRBMs given them
 before the_Sino-Soviet split in 1960.
 A.    They may have begun testing their own native
 versions as early as 1963.
 B.    Now they are apparently working on several
 surface-to-surface missile programs.

 2.   If the Chinese inaugurate a reasonably
 successful flight test program within
 the next year or so, they probably
 could have a few ICBMs deployed by the
 early 1970s.
 3.   These probably would be inferior in
 reliability and accuracy by US stand-
 ards, but they could--in Chinese eyes--
 constitute a limited intercontinental
 deterrent.
 D.    The Chinese Communists have built one copy
 of the Soviet G-class submarine.   In the
 ;Soviet fleet this class is armed with three
 ballistic missiles of 350-mile range.   We
 have to assume that the Chinese are working
 on a missile to fit the submarine.

 CHINESE CONVENTIONAL MILITARY FORCES
 ?
 ?
 1.    Despite Chinese progress in advanced weapons,
 the military power of Communist China for some
 years to come will derive primarily from the
 numerical strength of its enormous ground
 forces--about 2,300,000 men--and great reserves
 of manpower.
 II.     There are more than 100 infantry divisions and
 abou,: a dozen armor and artillery divisions in
 the Chinese Communist Army,  concentrated in the
 heavily populated regions of eastern China.
 A.     The Chinese Army probably has the capabil-
 ity to overrun any of its mainland neighbors
 in short order, provided it does not run
 into significant opposition from a major
 power.
 1.'    It has demonstrated its ability to
 move and fight with primitive trans-
 portation and rudimentary logistic
 support.
 2.     If it should come to all-out war,
 however,  the Chinese will be badly

 hampered by shortages of armor, heavy
 ordnance, mechanized transport, and fuel.
 III.    The Chinese air force and navy are oriented
 primarily toward defensive missions.
 A.    The bomber force at present consists of 250
 Jet light bombers--IL-28 BEAGLEs.   We believe
 the Chinese will start producing BADGER jet
 mediums about 1968.
 B.    The bulk of the jet fighter force consists of
 about 1,900 MIG-15s and MIG-17s, obtained
 10 or more years ago.
 1.    Over the past two years,  the Chinese
 have begun assembling supersonic MIG-19s
 in an aircraft plant at Shen-yang (Mukden)
 in Manchuria which was provided by the
 Soviets before 1960.    The Chinese
 inventory of MIG-19s has risen from 150
 to about 350,  and they have been able to
 supply another 50 to Pakistan in 1966.
 2.    The Chinese have about 35 of the Mach-two,
 delta-wing MIG-21s,  probably supplied by
 the Soviet Union in the early 1960s.

 IV.    Peking's navy is the weakest element of the
 It has the world's fourth largest undersea
 fleet, with 34 submarines, most of them
 medium-range torpedo attack boats.   They
 have no experience in extended operations,
 however, and most of their training appears
 to take place within 20 miles of the coast.
 B.    The Chinese are building submarines, de-
 stroyer escorts,  and guided-missile patrol
 boats.   They have four obsolete destroyers,
 six new DEs,  and 11 patrol boats.
 Chinese Forces in North Vietnam
 V.     We estimate that there are 26,000 to 48,000
 Chinese Communist military personnel in North
 Vietnam.
 A.   As far as we can determine, there are no
 ground combat formations.
 B.   :Evidence shows that there are two antiair-
 craft artillery divisions and possibly elements

 is
 of two more, manning the 85-millimeter and
 100-millimeter guns defending some of the
 key targets.
 C.    The rest of the Chinese personnel are mainly
 railway,  engineer, and logistic units,
 building airfields,  bridges, and the like,
 laying track, and keeping the supplies
 moving.

 ?
 Possibility of Chinese Intervention
 VI.     We believe that there are three situations in
 which Peking would feel obliged to intervene in
 force in the Vietnamese fighting.
 A.     One of these would arise from U.S. air
 strikes against targets in China.
 In May 1965, Chinese Foreign Minister
 Chen Yi asked the British charge in Peking
 to pass along a warning to this effect.
 B.     The second circumstance which would trigger
 Chinese intervention would be a major U.S.
 invasion of North Vietnam.   Chinese leaders
 passed this word to a visiting delegation
 from Ghana, shortly before Chen Yi talked
 with the British.

 C.     In addition,  if the collapse of the Hanoi
 Government should seem imminent, China
 would probably move into North Vietnam to
 "restore order."
 VII.     It is always dangerous to assume that the Chi-
 nese are going to be guided by rational deci-
 sions,                                   but we believe that Peking is bound to
 feel that the domestic political turmoil and the
 intensification of the dispute with Moscow leaves
 China less ready than it might otherwise be to
 engage in direct hostilities with the United
 States.
 A.     Another factor which would contribute to
 increased Chinese caution would be a growing
 belief in Peking that the United States is
 determined to persevere, over the short
 run at least, in the Vietnamese war.
 B.     We think,  therefore,  that the threshold of
 sensitivity--the level at which Peking would
 feel forced to fight--has probably been
 raised a degree or two.
 1.    For example, a shallow incursion by
 US troops into the Demilitarized Zone

 Approved For Release 2006/11/05: CIA-RDP79T00827A000600100003-4
 TOP SECRET      0
 between North and South Vietnam might
 be less likely today to trigger a Chi-
 nese reaction than it would have been
 in 1965.
 C.     Chinese statements concerning the "inevitabil-
 ity" of war with the US now appear only in-
 frequently.
 L.     Peking has made no mention of "volun-
 teers" for Vietnam since the fall of
 1965,  except for brief flurries last
 summer and again in December, after
 bombings in the area of Hanoi and Haiphong.
 2.     Peking has always said that the Viet-
 namese must bear the primary respon-
 sibility for fighting;  in recent months
 this theme has been given more emphasis.

 CHINESE POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS
 ?
 ?
 I.   Communist China is being racked by the greatest
 political convulsions since Mao Tse-tung took
 control in 1949.
 A.       Mao, at 73,  is aging, sick, and more and
 more inflexible.
 1.     He is clearly concerned that his
 Communist Party is losing the revolu-
 tionary zeal of its early days, and
 cannot be relied on to keep China on
 the right track after he is gone.
 2.     The teen-aged millions of the Red Guard
 are supposed to re-kindle that zeal with
 their youthful and unbridled enthusiasm.
 3.     When Mao re-appeared last summer after
 a protracted absence from public view,
 he passed over the men who had been the
 heads of the party hierarchy and named
 Defense Minister Lin Piao (Lin Byaw)
 as Number Two Man--in effect, Mao's
 designated successor.
 B.    To Mao Tse-tung,  the cultural revolution is
 probably primarily a drive to reshape the

 ?
 the Communist Party, or replace it with a
 more reliable, more fanatical, and younger
 version.
 C.    But for the men who aspire to succeed Mao,
 it became a naked struggle for power and
 for survival the minute Mao began to shake
 up the order of precedence in the leader-
 s;1ip.
 II.    It is difficult to determine from day to day
 where the cultural revolution stands, who is
 on which side, or who is going to come out on
 top.   The struggle seems to have entered a
 critical phase in January.
 A.    The most dramatic development has been Mao's
 call for the Red Army to back up the Red Guards
 and eliminate resistance to the cultural revolution.
 1.   We had been speculating when the resist-
 ance first developed that the army would
 have been called in even earlier if there
 were no doubts about its reliability.
 2.   Now there is evidence that the armed
 forces are considerably less than mono-
 lithic in their loyalty to Mao and Lin.

 ?
 III.     When and how will the turmoil in Peking finally
 be resolved?
 A.     We have no idea.   The opposing forces,
 judging by the protracted struggle,   must
 be quite evenly matched.   If the clashes
 between workers and Red Guards spread--
 particularly if the army's loyalties are
 divided--then we may soon see something
 for which there is no other term but Civil
 War.
 1.    Some days,  it looks as though the op-
 posing elements are digging in for a
 long winter of political trench war-
 fare.
 2.    The next day, a war of movement and a
 showdown may appear imminent.
 3.    I would say it is still too early to
 speculate usefully on the outcome.
 B.     There are two points, however, which we
 can make.
 1.    First, as long as China's leaders are
 pre-occupied with this internal wrangling,
 they will find it difficult to reach
 agreement on any new policy lines.   So
 TOP SECRET
 Approved For Release 2006/11/05: CIA-RDP79T00827A000600100003-4
 ?    TOP SECRET    0
 we do not expect any radical depar-
 tures from existing policies.
 2.                 Second, whoever wins, we can see no
 reason for suspecting that there will
 be any dilution of Peking's implacable
 hostility to the United States.
 Chinese Economy
 IV.    Finally, a quick look at the Chinese Communist
 ?
 economy:
 A.       China has regained only part of the ground
 lost when the Great Leap Forward collapsed
 in 1960 and Soviet aid was withdrawn.
 1.    Prospects to regain the momentum of
 the 1950's appear remote, even without
 the disruption of the "cultural revolu-
 tion."
 2.    The longer the political upheaval lasts,
 the greater the likelihood of severe
 damage to the economy.
 3.    There have already been extensive
 strikes, shutdowns, and disruption of
 transportation.

 0   TOP SECRET    0
 B.       It has taken an overriding priority on
 defense to permit the progress China has
 made in advanced weapons.
 1.    One of the ministries hard hit by the
 waves of political purges and poster
 denunciations has been a ministry
 directly related to the missile
 effort.
 C.     Stagnation in agriculture remains the chief
 obstacle to a resumption of adequate economic
 growth.
 1.    Peking claims a record harvest in 1966,
 but actual grain production was some-
 what lower in 1966 than in 1955.
 2.    It wasn't much above the level of 10
 years ago, when there were almost
 150 million fewer people to feed.
 3.    There were localized ration cuts, and
 it was only thanks to grain imports
 that the average ration could be kept
 above the lean levels of the poor
 year of 1960.
 4.    China imported more than 5 million tons
 of grain from the Free World in 1966,
 and will probably have to import substan-
 tially more this year.

 II.   The Indian attitude toward development of nuclear
 weapons has been complicated by Peking's nuclear
 capability.
 A.    Prime Minister Gandhi has maintained the
 government's "no bomb" nuclear policy despite
 criticism in Parliament.
 1.   Both the Prime Minister and the new Chair-
 man of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission,
 Dr.  Sarabhai, have stated that India's
 present economic and industrial position
 does not permit launching a nuclear weapons
 project, particularly from the viewpoint of
 developing suitable delivery systems.

 B.    India has the plutonium production capacity
 already to fabricate and test a device within
 a year of a decision to do so.
 1.   An agreement with Canada, however, stipu-

 reactor now operational will be used only
 for peaceful purposes.
 2.   Two other reactors which will be opera-
 tional in 1969 and 1970 are covered by
 safeguards.

 sophisticated research and test facilities to
 support this program.
 A.  The Soviets are aware of most of the chemical
 warfare agents known to the West.   Their own
 inventory includes at least one. agent which
 may be more toxic than any stockpiled by
 Western military powers.
 1.   We have identified more than 20 sites,
 mainly in the western and central Soviet
 Union, which we believe to be storage
 depots for chemical. warfare agents.
 B.  We believe that these stockpiles contain
 munitions for use by tactical aircraft,
 missiles, rockets, artillery, and mortars.
 Soviet troops also have a chemical warfare
 capability with spray systems, aerosol
 generators, land mines and grenades.

 C.  Soviet military leaders assume that the
 West would use chemical weapons in the event
 of general war.   All elements of the Soviet
 forces stress defensive chemical warfare
 training, and Soviet protective equipment
 for the armed forces is excellent.
 Bacteriological Warfare
 II.   The Soviet Union probably began investigating
 the concept of biological warfare in the
 nineteenthirties. References in Soviet scientific
 literature show a long-standing interest in a
 variety of diseases which are potential
 biological warfare agents.
 A.   There are several sites in the USSR which
 we suspect are supporting biological warfare
 research.   Testing could also be carried out
 at some of the chemical warfare research
 facilities.
 B.   The Soviet Union has the scientific foundation
 for a good capability in both the offensive
 and defensive aspects of biological warfare.
 The Soviets have probably developed some
 biological warfare agents, but we have no
 evidence as to which ones, or the extent of
 the program.

 SOVIET RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

 I.  The Soviets have given maximum support to military
 research and development since World War II, and
 it seems clear that they intend to maintain a
 vigorous program to update their military potential.
 A.   There have been some shortcomings--rigid
 planning procedures, overly centralized
 program direction, compartmentation of
 research, and--by our standards, poor
 quality control and poor industrial crafts-
 manship.
 1.   The pressure on weapons designers to
 deliver the goods has encouraged
 improvement of established technology
 in preference to new concepts in some
 fields.
 B.   At the same time the Soviets have repeatedly
 shown their willingness--with systems of the
 highest priority such as they'SS-11        -"
 --to start
 production and even deployment even before
 testing and evaluation is completed.

 H.    Soviet spending for military and space R&D and the
 procurement of advanced weapons is growing much
 faster than total defense expenditures.   The
 outlay for the so-called "exotics" has more than
 doubled since 1958.
 Most of this increase has gone to R & D,
 rather than procurement.   The Soviets
 obviously have accorded a high priority
 to advances in both strategic offense
 and strategic defense.
 Estimated expenditures for military and
 space research, development, testing and
 evaluation amounted to roughly 4.2 billion
 rubles in 1965, and are expected to
 increase to about 6.2 billion rubles by
 1970.
 This represents about 70 percent of the
 total expenditure for all research and
 development in the Soviet Union.
 III. There is a broad R $ D program in strategic
 offensive missiles.   Over the next five to ten
 years, we expect to see solid-fueled  and mobile
 systems enter the ICBM and MRBM/IRBM forces.
 A.    There has been no evidence so far of
 Soviet testing of advanced re-entry concepts,
 but we would expect to see investigation of
 penetration aids, maneuverable RV's, and

 independently-targeted RV's over the next
 10 years.
 B.   Research and development also continues on
 all the components of ABM and other defensive
 missile systems from early-warning and tracking
 radars to new missiles and probably new
 warheads.
 IV.   In space, the Soviets have been working on a
 1   b-life, manned orbital space station, and
 orb tal bombardment systems.
 A.   Wi h optimum progress in development of
 the  ecessary booster and spacecraft, the
 Soviets might be able to orbit a manned
 space sta 'on as early as 1968.   They
 have the cap bility to orbit a long-life
 station with a  anted performance in the
 period 1970 to 19 5.
 B.   The new space treat,   together with the
 greater effectiveness  f existing ICBMs,
 makes it unlikely that t e Soviets would
 push the development of a    ltiple-orbit
 bombardment system at this
