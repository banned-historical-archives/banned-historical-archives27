 Appendix
 Asia as Puma y Target of Communists
 and Necessity of United States Keeping
 Its Word in Vietnam Discussed by Col-
 umnist Carl McCardle in Wheeling,
 W. Va., Intelligencer
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. JENNINGS RANDOLPH
 OF WEST VIRGINIA
 IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
 Wednesday, August 18, 1965
 Mr. RANDOIPH.  Mr. President, one
 of our country's dedicated and well in-
 formed journalists, Carl W. McCardle of
 the Wheeling Intelligencer staff, Wheel-
 ing, W. Va., has made significant con-
 tributions to the discussions of the Com-
 munist movement in general and the
 Vietnam issue in particular.
 Mr. McCardle writes not only as an ex-
 perienced and respected newsman but,
 also, from a broad background of service
 in public affairs and international rela-
 tions with the U.S. Department of State.
 In his Intelligencer column of August
 13, 1965, Mr. McCardle recalled his ex-
 perience in having covered the United
 Nations for the Philadelphia, Pa., Bulle-
 tin, and he quoted appropriately and ex-
 tensively from a dispatch he filed with
 that newspaper on November 30, 1950,
 concerning the performance of the Chi-
 nese Communists before the United Na-
 tions at that time.  He concludes that
 now, as then, Asia remains the primary
 target of the Communists.
 In a column on August 6, Mr. McCardle
 wrote convincingly on the theme of the
 necessity that the United States keep its
 word in Vietnam. He emphasizes several
 highly pertinent facts, and especially
 clarifies two points which seem not to be
 fully understood.
 The first is an answer to the question,
 "What is the Vietcong?"
 Mr. McCardle responds with the obser-
 vation that "it is not a righteous band
 of men who, in supposedly justifiable dis-
 agreement with the Republic of South
 Vietnam, is engaged in a civil war. with
 It, as the Reds in their own sinister way,
 have tried to picture it. The Vietcong is
 composed of Communists who, after
 Vietnam was divided at the 17th parallel
 between the Communist north and the
 free south, went up to North Vietnam for
 training and then infiltrated into South
 Vietnam."
 The second point of Mr. McCardle's
 column is that "if this is an American
 war, it is mainly because the United
 States is the Red's public enemy No 1,
 powerful enough to prevent Communist
 world domination.  And we are not pre-
 cisely alone, as some persons would have
 us believe, In combating the Reds in
 Vietnam.  The Australians, New Zea-
 landers, Filipinos are there and South
 Korea, which has already sent 2,000
 fighting men to help us in South Viet-
 nam,  is                                                                         now  sending  15,000  more.
 Others are there helping, which is a fact
 that isn't publicized."
 The McCardle column on the neces-
 sity of the United States keeping its
 pledge in Vietnam concluded with the
 declaration  that  President  Johnson
 knows the stakes are high, and with this
 forecast:
 If the Reds win in Vietnam which they
 won't-then they would go on to try to get
 southeast Asia, the Rice Bowl of Asia with
 its riches, such as tin and rubber and other
 products the Communist need.  If they were
 to succeed in southeast Asia, then you could
 more or less say goodby to all of Asia, and
 the American  defense line in the Pacific
 against  the  Communist  aim  of  world
 dominance.
 Mr. President, the two McCardle col-
 umns are meaningful and helpful con-
 tributions to the discussions by our citi-
 zens which appropriately are taking
 place throughout the country on these
 vital issues.  In this interest and con-
 cern, therefore, I ask unanimous con-
 sent to have printed in the Appendix of
 the RECORD the articles from the Wheel-
 ing Intelligencer.
 There being no objection, the articles
 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:

 CITES NECESSITY OF UNITED STATES KEEPING
 ITS WORD IN VIET
 (By Carl W. McCardle)
 I am writing this column well in advance
 of formal reports scheduled to be made by
 Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Secretary
 of Defense Robert McNamara on Vietnam.
 I would hope that Secretaries Rusk and
 McNamara would say that the United States
 is not going to give way in Vietnam and
 that we will do what is necessary to drive
 the Reds back to where they belong above
 the 17th parallel from which they invaded
 South Vietnam.  I would also personally
 welcome it if the two U.S. officials make clear
 that the outcome in the Vietnam struggle is
 of vital interest to the future of the United
 States.
 Should the United States go back on its
 word made as I recall around 1954 by Presi-
 dent  Eisenhower  that  the  United  States
 would protect the territorial integrity of free
 South Vietnam, then no free country any-
 where would rely with confidence on U.S.
 assurance against the Communist menace,
 especially in Asia.
 The same would have been true if Presi-
 dent Eisenhower had not fulfilled similar
 safeguards  elsewhere  which  had  become
 American  policy  under  Democratic Presi-
 dents.  It is part of the greatness of the
 United States that on foreign affairs, the
 members of both political parties, always
 with some exception-and the right of dis-
 sent has likewise been a source of the tower-
 ing stature of the United States-respect-
 fully supported the President.
 I had to laugh when the Communist re-
 gime of North Vietnam, solemnly announced
 on Sunday that it is ready to respond to a
 call for help from the Vietcong to fight the
 Americans in South Vietnam.  This is psy-
 chological twaddle.
 The highly trained 325th Vietnam Division
 is already in South Vietnam, as well as other
 contingents.
 And what is the Vietcong, anyway?  It is
 not a righteous band of men who, in sup-
 posedly justifiable disagreement with the Re-
 public of South Vietnam, is engaged in a
 "civil war" with it, as the Reds in their own
 sinister way, have tried to picture it.
 The Vietcong are Communists who, after
 Vietnam was divided at the 17th parallel be-
 tween the Communist North and the free
 South, went up to North Vietnam for train-
 ing and then infiltrated into South Vietnam.
 I am personally surprised and proud that
 our fighting men so far have done, along
 with the South Vietnamese troops, so well
 during the monsoon or rainy season in Viet-
 nam.  They have had their problems, but
 theirs, as it has .turned out to date, haven't
 been so damaging as the Communists have
 experienced.
 It had been predicted that the Vietcong,
 well acquainted with the rainy season, would
 take advantage of that period, which lasts
 roughly for a little more than 4 months,
 through June and on through September, to
 mount a big offensive that would knock us
 out.  They haven't been able to do that.  In-
 stead they have suffered heavy losses, and
 haven't, in the monsoon, gained one bit of
 territory.  And the U.S. air raids in North
 Vietnam have done a good job.  I still don't
 believe that Red China, or Soviet Russia, will
 actively get into the Vietnam war.  They've
 been saying they would for months.  If this
 Is an American war, it is mainly because
 the United States Is the Reds' public enemy
 No. 1, powerful enough to prevent Commu-
 nist world domination.  And we are not pre-
 cisely alone in combating the Reds' in Viet-
 nam.   The  Australians,  New  Zealanders,
 Filipinos are there and South Korea which
 has already sent 2,000 fighting men to help
 us in South Vietnam, are now sending 15,000
 more.
 Others are there helping which isn't publi-
 cized.
 The United States has more than 80,000
 troops in Vietnam.   This will increase to
 125,000 or more.  President Johnson knows
 that the stakes are high. If the Reds win in
 Vietnam, which they won't, then they would
 go on to try to get southeast Asia, the rice
 bowl of Asia with its other riches, such as
 tin and rubber and other products the Com-
 munists need.  If they were to succeed in
 southeast Asia, then you could more or less
 say goodby to Asia, and to the American
 defense line in the Pacific against the Com-
 munist aim of world dominance.

 ASIA REMAINS PRIMARY  TARGET  OF
 COMMUNISTS
 (By Carl W. McCardle)
 "Back in Washington, after 'a trip to the
 United Nations to watch the great Chinese
 Communist performance everybody has been
 telling us to calm down, not to get excited.
 "Maybe so.
 "But at the moment we happen to think
 that too many people, including too many

 officials and generals, have been too calm too
 long, and it is time that we all get just a
 little bit excited.
 "It could be that Gen. Wu Hsiu-chuan,
 the Chinese Communist mouthpiece at the
 U.N., unhinged us somewhat.  But we know
 that anyone who listened to Wit's 2-hour
 exercise in vilification with the United States
 his villain, can no longer be complacent
 about the mortal fix that we are in.
 "As is usual with the aggressors of this
 century, Wu laid out the blueprint, and also
 as usual probably few people will believe that
 he could mean what he clearly meant.  He
 said:
 "'One of the master planners of Japanese
 aggression, Tanaka, once said: "To conquer
 the world, one must first conquer Asia; to
 conquer Asia, one must first conquer China;
 to conquer China, one must first conquer
 Manchuria and Mongolia; to conquer Man-
 churia and Mongolia one must first conquer
 Korea and Formosa." '
 'Th_ ats just about the way the Commu-
 nists are doing it, isn't it?  Wu didn't say
 that, of course. He was citing the quotation
 es a text for his brazen thesis that this is
 the goal of the American Imperialists.
 "As for us, we are ready to read it just the
 way Hitler could always be read, and realize
 just what the Communists are up to. From
 now on we happen to think that anybody
 who tries to rationalize the Chinese Com-
 munists in any way except that they are
 eager-beaver accomplices of Russia is very
 foolish, indeed.
 "As a correspondent, we heard the Nazi
 supermen spouting their hateful propaganda
 in the thirties, and for what seems to be
 a large part of our life now we have been
 on the scene to hear Molotov and Vishinsky,
 GroMyko and Malik spout the same kind of
 propaganda at Lake Success, Paris, London,
 and Moscow.  But we must admit that we
 have never allowed ourselves to get so down-
 right mad over any of these outrages as we
 did over the show put on by Ambassador--
 as he has the effrontery to call himself-Wu.
 "The whole business was a disgrace to
 decent people everywhere.
 "Here was this special agent of the world's
 tyranny, invited by the U.N. Security Coun-
 cil, to come to Lake Success, and 10 peace-
 loving diplomats had to sit there in polite
 silence  while  he  audaciously  called  the
 United States every name in the book al-
 most;  imputed  to  us  all the predatory
 motives that the Communists have; and,
 with a flourish, insulted the President of the
 United States. The  11th diplomat, Rus-
 sia's Malik, naturally was highly pleased,
 leaning back in his chair self-satisfied and
 smug.
 "After the bizarre ordeal was over, we asked
 a  top  ranking American  official  how  he
 managed to remain silent through it all, to
 take it from this guest-star liar, without ris-
 ing up and walking out of the meeting in
 disgust, with a parting assertion that this
 Peiping intruder should be thrown out of
 the U.N. premises, and out of the country.
 "The American said it was all he could do
 to remain quiet.
 "We then asked a British diplomat how
 he felt about it.  (The British have recog-
 nized the Chinese Communist regime, and
 have felt that the  Chinese  Communists
 should be seated in the U.N. and then per-
 haps  they  could                        be wooed away  from
 Russia.)
 "'He was a bit hysterical, I must say,' said
 our English friend about Wu."
 This rather long quote is from my favorite
 author-myself, of course.
 It is excerpted from a column of mine
 that was published on the opposite editorial
 page of the Philadelphia Bulletin.  The date
 of its appearance In the Bulletin was some
 time ago.  It was November 80, 1950.  I was
 then chief of the Bulletin's Washington bur-
 eau.  I had gone up to New York to report
 the story of the hearing by the U.N. Security
 Council of a delegation of Red Chinese ob-
 servers, headed by Ambassador Wu.
 Soviet Russia had insisted that the Com-
 munist regime on the Chinese mainland
 have the observers  on hand at the U.N.
 Security Council when the matter of which
 regime-the Communists on the mainland
 or . the  Nationalists  on  Formosa--should
 represent China in the U.N. was debated.
 Soviet Russia and Red China were then
 close allies.  Some experts say that they
 are not so close now.   Perhaps yes; perhaps
 no.  In my opinion a Communist is a Com-
 munist.  And I think that if there has been
 a break between Russia and Red China it
 was brought about by the so-called softer
 line taken by Khrushchev.  Mao Tse-tung,
 the bossman of the Chinese Communists,
 was and is an old Stalinist.  In my viewpoint
 a major factor in the surprise ouster of
 Khrushchev was that he seemed to be pursu-
 ing a course that might lead to an open
 showdown with Red China, which the Com-
 munist masters did not want on either side.
 Red China, after Professor Wu's exhibition
 of what a nonaggressive, peace-loving regime
 he was speaking for, never has gained ad-
 mission to the U.N.
 I should perhaps point out thatthe U.N.
 was  then housed in temporary quarters
 called Lake Success, which was somewhat
 ironical for various reasons including the
 fact that there was not even a lake there.
 Later the U.N's imposing own headquarters
 were built.
 In my November 30, 1950, column I said
 that some "reexamining could be done with
 great usefulness in respect to our top com-
 mand in Korea."
 I wrote: "Word here in Washington is that
 'intelligence' fell down and that led General
 acArthur to be lured into the Chinese Com-
 unist trap."  I said that, I had seen an
 ppraisal of our "Intelligence at the time" 2
 ays before MacArthur jumped off on his
 n the war and get the boys home by
 hristmas offensive.  The intelligence report
 aid that the Chinese Communists "were
 uilding up menacing reserves in Man-
 huria."  The record shows that on Novem-
 r 26, 195Q, some 200,000 Chinese Commu-
 ist "volunteers crossed the Yalu River into
 orth Korea."
 General MacArthur was relieved of his
 command by President Truman on April 11,
 1961, for not clearing statements by him
 through the Defense Department. But on be-
 half of General MacArthur it should be said
 that he was aged 70 then and had before
 his downfall performed brilliantly in Korea.
 The point of this essay is that for a long
 time the Communist have regarded Asia as
 the primary battleground.  And the reason
 they did not succeed completely in Korea, one
 of the places mentioned in Professor Wu's
 blueprint, was that the United States and
 other countries resisted them with force and
 they were finally stopped at the 36th parallel
 from which they had begun their invasion.
 And as for Formosa, also mentioned by Dr.
 Wu, the United States has made it very
 clear it will use force to repel any attack upon
 Formosa.
 Social Security Observes 30th Birthday
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 of
 HON. THADDEUS J. DULSKI
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, August 18, 1965
 Mr. DULSKI.   Mr.  Speaker,  this
 month, 30 years ago, our Nation saw the
 birth of the social security program.
 Prior to its inception, this was one of
 the most controversial issues of our time.
 Today it is hailed as one of the most
 beneficial programs our Nation has ever
 inaugurated.
 The significance of social security is
 well depicted in articles which appeared
 in two leading newspapers in Buffalo,
 N.Y.  Under unanimous consent, I in-
 clude the following articles from the
 Buffalo Courier-Express, dated August
 14, entitled "Social Security Observes
 30th Birthday," and from the Buffalo
 Evening News, dated August 14, entitled
 "Social Security Marks 30th Year of
 Service":
 SOCIAL SECURITY MARKS 30TH YEAR OF SERV-
 The country's most sweeping attack on old-
 age poverty and helpless dependency was
 made 30 years ago when on August 14, 1935,
 President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the
 Social Security Act.  The act provided only
 bare minimum coverage to many elderly per-
 sons during its first few years but it did
 provide some measure of independence for
 elderly citizens who labored all of their lives
 but were unable to build up a retirement
 nest egg.
 While the Social Security Act passed both
 Houses by overwhelming majorities it was
 attacked on many sides as confiscatory and
 socialistic by those who opposed it.  Further,
 there was a question as to the constitution-
 ality of the act and this question was not
 cleared up until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled
 on it almost 2 years later.
 How great an impact it has had on the
 Nation can be understood when one realizes
 that 76 million workers now are covered by
 the act and about 20 million presently are
 receiving benefits up to $135.90 a month
 with additional increases coming along until
 1971 when the top payment will be $167.90 a
 month.
 Insurance and retirement plans have been
 written around this act and its coverage has
 been extended to include medical and hos-
 pital care for retirees at a time when they
 need such protection the most.  This phase
 will not become effective until next year and
 still is meeting bitter opposition from some
 quarters.
 In view of the success of the original plan
 and its amendments we cannot help but won-
 der what the opposition will be, or if there
 will be any, 30 years from now.
 SOCIAL SECURITY MARKS 307`H YEAR OF SERV-
 ICE-PROGRAM SERVES 20 MILLION BENEFICI-
 ARIES WITH BROADENED COVERAGE AND BmsE-
 Frrs
 Social security marks its 80th birthday to-
 day with many happy returns from 20 million
 beneficiaries.
 About 112,000 are in Erie County.
 Since  President  Franklin  D.  Roosevelt
 signed the original bill August 14, 1935, social
 security coverage has been broadened and its
 benefits increased.
 The original legislation has been amended
 nine times, most recently this year to in-
 crease benefits 7 percent, and to provide
 health insurance for the elderly, starting next
 July 1.
 Costs have risen as coverage was broadened.
 Thus, the new amendments raise the rate de-
 duction to 4.2 percent up to $8,600 annually,
 starting January 1, 1966.  In the original law,
 it was 1 percent of the first $3,000.

 OF CALIFORNIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, August 18, 1965
 Mr. LIPSCOMB. Mr. Speaker, amidst
 all the recent talk of increasing trade
 with the Communist bloc and the sup-
 posed benefits that would be gained
 politically and economically, columnist
 David Lawrence, in the Washington Eve-
 ning Star of August 13, 1965, clearly
 sums ? up the problems of trade with the
 Communist bloc. He particularly shows
 the effect such trade is having on the
 United States and Vietnam.
 Under leave to extend my remarks I
 submit the column by Mr. Lawrence for
 inclusion in the RECORD:
 TRADE WITH WEST BOLSTERS REDS
 (By David Lawrence)
 Which is more important-to make money
 for oneself in trading with an enemy or to -
 help save human lives?
 Everybody would say at once that it is
 obviously better to avert bloodshed and end
 any war that's going on.  But when this is
 applied in practice, it turns out that many
 individuals  in various  countries,  hitherto
 allied wth us, have a greater passion for
 dollars or pounds or francs or marks or pesos.
 There wouldn't be a war in Vietnam today
 and American boys wouldn't be fighting and
 dying in a far-off land if the nations of the
 world whom the United States has befriended
 and to whom it continues year after year
 to send billions of dollars of aid took a stand
 in support of the American position in Viet-
 nam.
 There would be a different story to tell if
 trade with Red China were cut off by the
 free world, and if the Soviets saw that the
 same thing would happen to them should
 they keep on siding with North Vietnam by
 building missile sites there and sending weap-
 ons to be used to kill American soldiers and
 airmen.  The Russian people, if they knew
 the facts, would not go along with the Red
 Chinese.
 Perhaps the Johnson administration has
 failed to be realistic about the situation.
 The President has said that he has ample
 authority to send American armed forces
 to southeast Asia under the resolution passed
 by both Houses of Congress on August 10,
 1964.
 But, while this is true, Congress has not
 formally declared "a state of war," which
 is  recognized  in  international law as re-
 quiring all nations to refrain from sending
 contraband goods to the belligerents under
 penalty of seizure or confiscation of ship-
 ments of such commodities.
 Red China is in every sense a cobelligerent
 with North Vietnam.  The Vietcong couldn't
 last a month if forces and weapons were not
 wheat to Communists at 75 cents a bushel
 less than American flour millers have to pay
 for it.  And If Congress authorizes the ad-
 ministration's new wheat program, the Com-
 munists next year will be able to buy our
 wheat at $1.25 a bushel less than it is sold
 for food in this country.  In other words,
 the administration proposes to sell our wheat
 to Communists at the low world price while
 at the same time it is asking Congress to
 boost the price of domestic wheat for food
 to  double the  world  price-which  means
 American    consumers  would  have  to pay
 higher prices for wheat foods-for exam-
 ple, 2 cents a loaf more for bread.
 "Moreover, we are beginning to hear that
 inasmuch as our grain sales to Russia simply
 free Russian grain for export to Red China
 and Cuba, we might as well get in on this
 trade directly.  Not mentioned is the argu-
 ment that if we did not sell grain to Russia,
 it would have less grain to supply Red China
 and Cuba.  And if we sell to Red China, why
 not ship food directly to North Vietnam,
 even though it is directing a war against us
 and killing Americans in South Vietnam?
 "Although grain is not usually classified
 as 'strategic material' in the sense of arms
 and   ammunition,   it   certainly  becomes
 strategic when our enemies are hungry and
 can't feed themselves."
 So it comes back to the same old question:
 Which is more important-to make money
 for oneself or to help save human lives, espe-
 cially American lives?  The war the United
 States is fighting in Vietnam has a worthy
 purpose and Winning it can do a great deal to
 prevent further acts of aggression and to
 preserve world peace.  But if, as in the 1930s,
 private greed supersedes the interests of the
 people as a whole, the world may again see
 a global conflict.  For it was the failure of
 the embargo on oil against Mussolini in 1935
 and the flagrant indifference of the nations
 of Europe to the plea of President Roose-
 velt in 1937 for a quarantine or economic
 embargo against Hitler that brought on the
 very conditions which made World War II

 Wednesday, August 18, 1965
 Mr. DAGUE.                                  Mr. Speaker, in the
 New York Times of August 10 there ap-
 peared a rather interesting commentary
 concerning  the                             approach  of  certain
 Peruvian Indians to their agricultural
 problems. It reports:
 PERUVIAN  INDIANS  BLOCK  HELP  FOR  GORED
 TORERO
 LIMA,  PERU  (Reuters).-Indian    peasants
 in Canas Province expect an excellent harvest
 because of the death of a bullfighter and
 the serious goring of seven spectators.
 Recent reports said a large crowd cheered
 the death of the bullfighter, Pepe Huanca,
 from a stomach wound after he was tossed
 by a bull.   The Indians believe that the
 death of a torero means good harvests and
 increased wool crop.  Seven spectators who
 jumped into the ring to aid the torero were
 gored by the bull.
 Local authorities were unable to stop the
 bullfight because of the Indians' hostility, the
 reports said.
 If we shared the superstitions of
 these Peruvian Indians, I suppose we
 might conclude that this legislative ex-
 hibition augured great things for Ameri-
 can agriculture.
 If a bloodied and beleaguered sacrifice
 portends prosperity, we surely have con-
 jured up about as much as we can take
 at one time.
 For in the course of consideration of
 this conglomerate agriculture bill, we
 have watched the interests of the Amer-
 ican farmer in effigy, butted and rebutt-
 ed, gored and trampled and ground into
 submission, and every effort to try to save
 him has been hostilely turned back by
 unyielding numbers.
 It has been quite a performance, and
 there can be no doubt about it-again,
 the bull has prevailed.  Indeed, we see
 reaffirmed the old observation that "cows
 may come, and cows may go; but the bull
 goes on forever."

 Wednesday, August 18, 1965
 Mr. SCHMIDHAUSER.  Mr. Speaker,
 I would like to call to the attention of my
 colleagues in the House of Representa-
 tives an excellent editorial regarding a
 recommendation by the American Farm
 Bureau Federation that the interest rate
 on future REA loans, to rural electric
 cooperatives be raised.
 The editorial, which appeared in the
 May  1965  issue  of  Current News,  a
 monthly publication of the Eastern Iowa
 Light & Power Cooperative, follows:
 LOCAL, NATIONAL POLICIES DIFFER
 The American Farm Bureau Federation on
 April 29 recommended to Congress that the
 interest rate on future REA loans to rural
 electric cooperatives be raised to "the cost of
 long-term funds to the Federal Government"
 or more than double the present 2-percent-
 rate.
 This position is similar to that taken by
 the power companies, the U.S. Chamber of
 Commerce, and other REA. critics.
 Your cooperative was - quite  shocked to
 learn that the American Farm Bureau Fed-

 were so small that the only value their pro-
 test had was that of furnishing some new
 fodder  for the  Communists  around the
 world.  Reports that went to the Reds
 a'hroad no doubt magnified the numbers of
 those on hand and hauling off a few limp
 demonstrators against the U.S. policy in
 Vietnam probably was dubbed police brutal-
 ity by Communist propagandists.
 Here at home, however, it was apparent
 that the Assembly of Unrepresented People
 did not represent many people in this coun-
 try.  The people they represented were our
 enemies all over the world.
 GET CONGRESS HOME
 The view of a segment of Washington, at
 least, is that the President has been sur-
 prised by the speed with which some parts
 of his program have been enacted, even
 though in the past they have been considered
 highly controversial.
 The President apparently did not know his
 own strength.
 Aid to local schools? medicare, even subsi-
 dized rent, not only get the approval of
 Congress, but there is talk in that body of
 ways the original plans can be broadened
 and extended.
 Only a few items remain on the Presi-
 dent's list of musts as he submitted them
 originally to Congress.  Before he lets the
 Members  go home, he will doubtless  get
 them.  It is not part of the Johnson tech-
 nilque .to take the pressure off when he has
 everything rolling his way.
 All of this means that the best interests
 of the country will be served by as early a
 return home by Congress as is possible.  Any
 Congress which voluntarily yields its right
 to perform as a coequal part of the Federal
 Establishment, as this one has, is a continu-
 ing threat to the Nation.
 Progress at Geneva
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. JONATHAN B. BINGHAM
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, August 18, 1965
 Mr. BINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, as Sen-
 ator ROBERT F. KENNEDY and others have
 recently pointed out, there is no greater
 threat to the future of mankind than the
 impending  proliferation  of  nuclear
 weapons.
 It is difficult for those of us who are
 not experts to understand the signifi-
 ce,nce of negotiations in this field. Ap-
 parently, the proposals just made in Ge-
 neva by the administration are far more
 important than has been generall recog-
 nized.
 This morning's Washington Post con-
 tained two articles on this subject which
 underline the significance of the U.S.
 proposal. Under leave to revise and ex-
 tend my remarks, I include herewith
 these perceptive and enlightening arti-
 cles:
 [From the Washington Post, Aug. 18, 1965]
 PROGRESS AT GENEVA
 (By Joseph Kraft)
 Anybody can sing a dirge on the draft
 treaty against the further spread of nuclear
 weapons that this country presented yester-
 day at Geneva.                          The Russians are not about
 to sign.    Prance and China are not even
 in the conference.  And the draft is only a
 piece of paper anyhow.
 Even so, the draft is probably the biggest
 step toward peace since the test ban treaty
 of 2 years ago.  Indeed, its mere existence
 confirms  the  President's  growing mastery
 over forces and pressures that have previous-
 Iy slowed or blunted almost all conciliatory
 proposals of the United States.
 Up to now, discussion of nonproliferation
 of nuclear weapons was everybody's favorite
 excuse for braying insults.  That fatal temp-
 tation could be seen even in the relatively
 mild sessions of the present Geneva meetings.
 The Russians kicked off by saying that the
 price for a treaty was that this country aban-
 don Vietnam, Laos, the Congo, and West
 Germany.  The American delegate retorted
 that the Russians were using the talks as a
 cover "for the form of aggression they call
 wars of national liberation."  The most im-
 portant neutrals at Geneva-India, Sweden,
 and  Egypt-thereupon declared that they
 would make no commitments until the Big
 Two settled down to the realities.
 The treaty draft at least gets the subject
 down to realities.  It indicates what is re-
 quired,  from  big                                                                              countries  and  small,  if
 early and rapid proliferation of nuclear weap-
 ons is to be prevented.  Diplomats would
 not be diplomats if they were not adept at
 avoiding the subject.  But from here on in,
 when nonproliferation is the subject, the
 world will know who is talking seriously and
 who is merely sprouting propaganda.
 In working out the draft, moreover, the
 White  House  asserted  primacy  over  two
 power centers in the West that, for good rea-
 Sons of their own, have usually been against
 conciliatory moves.  The West Germans, for
 one,  have  feared that a  nonproliferation
 agreement would foreclose their chance to
 participate in NATO decisions on nuclear
 weapons.    A section of the State Department
 has always Wanted to humor Bonn on the
 grounds that otherwise vicious nationalism
 would reassert itself in German politics.
 For years, the combination of Bonn and
 Foggy Bottom has been slowly diluting pro-
 posals  favored  by  determined  Presidents.
 With German elections set for September 19,
 and with little chance that the Russians
 would sign anything, another victory for the
 combination looked like a sure bet. But
 two happy circumstances, and a large dose
 of maneuvering skill, made it possible for the
 White House to beat the odds.
 The  first happy circumstance  was the
 speech calling for a nonproliferation treaty,
 by Senator RoFIERT F. KENNEDY of June 23.
 The speech drew widespread and favorable
 attention, including endorsement from the
 nuclear deans of the Senate, CLINTON P. AN-
 DERSON and JOHN O. PASTORS.  The President,
 in effect, was on his mettle to produce.  Next
 day, with an intimation that it would brook
 no foot-dragging by the State Department,
 the White House requested proposals for a
 draft treaty from the Arms Control and Dis-
 armament Agency.
 As to the second happy circumstance, for
 domestic political reasons the British Gov-
 ernment had been longing to take a new
 initiative in disarmament.  In eagerness to
 engage the Russians, the British, on July 26,
 came up with a plan that would have cut
 out the Germans entirely from a voice in
 NATO nuclear affairs.  Such a plan, had it
 been put forward as a formal proposal at
 Geneva, would probably have blown the al-
 liance to bits.
 With that threat in the air, the United
 States was under even more pressure to come
 up with a draft treaty, while the Germans,
 for once, had to make concessions.  After
 2 weeks of behind-the-scenes talks, the Ger-
 mans, and the British came round to a plan
 that continues an option for German par-
 ticipation in NATO nuclear decisions even if
 a nonproliferation treaty is reached. That,
 in effect, is the American draft treaty pro-
 posal.
 The end result is that a door once locked
 tight is now slightly ajar. If that gain looks
 A4623
 minimal, the fact is that, just as in the test
 ban, the Russians may, any time, walk
 through the door.

 SOVIET OBJECTION OBSCURES U.S. SHIFT
 ON NUCLEAR ISSUE
 (By Murrey Marder)
 Prompt and expected Soviet objection yes-
 terday to the U.S. draft treaty to halt the
 spread of nuclear weapons obscuted the fact
 that it marked a public change in the Amer-
 ican position.
 In the proposal, the United States in fact
 did agree to a new kind of limitation on
 what the Soviet Union publicly objects to
 most: the development of a nuclear force in-
 side the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
 Under  the  new  language,  according  to
 American officials, such a force could not
 evolve into an Organization with "independ-
 ent power to use nuclear weapons" unless
 a present nuclear nation contributed all of
 its weapons to it.
 HOPES PUT ON MLF
 The United States, particularly at West
 Germany's urging, always has been anxious
 to keep open the possibility that the now
 dormant and disputed multilateral nuclear
 force, or anything like it, someday might
 evolve into an independent Western Euro-
 pean nuclear force.
 That possibility Is still open under the new
 language, but only if either Britain, France,
 or the United States would surrender their
 present national nuclear forces to the joint
 force.
 That comes about through some delicately
 contrived  phraseology,  originally  largely
 British in origin, in the key article I of the
 U.S. Draft Treaty:
 "Each of the nuclear states party to this
 treaty undertakes not to transfer any nu-
 clear weapons into the national control of
 any non-nuclear state, either directly, or in-
 directly through a military alliance; and each
 undertakes not to take any other action
 which would cause an increase in the total
 number of states and other organizations
 having independent power to use nuclear
 weapons."
 WOULD PUT CEILING AT FIVE
 The United States, the Soviet Union,-Brit-
 tain, France, and Communist China now are
 the world's nuclear members.  The inten-
 tion of the draft treaty is to make that
 numberof five the ceiling on the world nu-
 clear grouping of either nations or organiza-
 tions.
 In other words, in order for there to be a
 veto-free NATO nuclear force, the United
 States, Britain, or France would have to sur-
 render the "independent power to use nuclear
 weapons."
 The United States, with its massive nuclear
 power, surely will not do so.  France, at least
 under President de Gaulle, is adamant about
 retaining its nuclear force.  Therefore, it is
 said,  Britain,  under  this proposal,  would
 hold the key to determine if a veto-free
 NATO force might ever evolve, because NATO
 then would in effect replace Britain as the
 world's fifth nuclear power.
 Even so, Britain dissented.        The reason
 given in Geneva yesterday by cl}ief British
 negotiator Lord Chalfont was that the draft
 treaty "does not rule out the possibility that
 an associatign of states could by a majority
 decision use nuclear weapons"
 While that possibility may be only theo-
 retical, Lord Chalfont said, Britain would
 prefer "this door be closed."
 In other words, he said, he wanted to as-
 sure that if a nuclear nation gave up its
 nuclear deterrent and joined a federation of
 states, that federation could not have inde-
 pendent control over nuclear weapons.
 FEAR OF GERMANY CITED
 A major reason for that stand is continu-
 ing popular concern in Britain that Germany
