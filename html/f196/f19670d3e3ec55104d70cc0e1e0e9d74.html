STATEMENT OF THE MANAGERS ON THE PART OF THE 
HOUSE 
The managers on the part of the House at the conference on the 
disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the amendments of the Senate 
to the bill (H.R. 8864) to carry out the obligations of the United States 
under the International Coffee Agreement, 1962, signed at New York 
on September 28, 1962, and for other purposes, submit the following 
statement in explanation of the effect of the action agreed upon by the 
conferees and recommended in the accompanying conference report: 
Amendment numbered 1: Under the bill as passed by the House, the 
short title for the bill was the "International Coffee Agreement Act of 
1963". Senate amendment numbered 1 strikes out "1963" and in-
serts "1964". The House recedes. 
Amendment number 2: This amendment adds a new section 4 to 
the bill providing that whenever the Congress finds, in a concurrent 
resolution agreed to by the two Houses, that there is an unwarranted 
increase in the price of coffee in the United States attributable, in 
whole or in part, to the application or operation of the International 
Coffee Agreement, 1962, the President shall cause a copy of such 
concurrent resolution to be transmitted to the International Coffee 
Council and the Executive Board established under chapter IV of such 
agreement. The new section 4 would also provide that if, after the 
expiration of thirty days after the transmittal of such concurrent 
resolution, the President finds that the Council has failed to make such 
adjustments of quotas, or to take such other action, as is necessary to 
remedy the situation, the President is authorized and directed to 
cause to be filed with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, 
in accordance with the provisions of article 68 of such agreement, 
written notice of withdrawal of the United States from the Inter-
national Coffee Agreement, 1962. The House recedes. 
Amendment number 3: The bill as passed by the House authorized 
the President to exercise any powers conferred on him by the bill 
through such agency or officer as he shall direct. Under Senate 
amendment numbered 3, the President would be authorized to exer-
cise any powers and duties conferred on him by the bill, other than 
the powers and duties conferred by the new section 4 added by Senate 
amendment numbered 2, through such agency or officer as he shall 
direct. The House recedes. 
Amendments numbers 4, 5, and 6: These are clerical amendments. 
The House recedes.

No. 941 
INTERNATIONAL COFFEE AGREEMENT ACT OF 1963 
MARCH 12 (legislative day, MARCH 9), 1964--Ordered to be printed 
Mr. SMATHERS, from the Committee on Finance, submitted the 
following 
REPORT 
together with 
MINORITY AND INDIVIDUAL VIEWS 
[To accompany H.R. 8864] 
The Committee on Finance, to whom was referred the bill (H.R: 
8864) to carry out the obligations of the United States under the 
International Coffee Agreement, 1962, signed at New York on Sep-
tember 28, 1962, and for other purposes, having considered the same, 
report favorably thereon with amendments and recommend that the 
bill as amended do pass. 
PURPOSE 
The purpose of H.R. 8864 is to authorize the procedures required 
in order that the President might carry out the obligations of the 
United States under the International Coffee Agreement of 1962. 
That agreement has been signed by the United States, and the Senate 
has given its advice and consent to ratification. 
The bill would authorize the President to require all coffee enter-
ing U.S. markets and all exports of coffee to be accompanied by a 
certificate of origin or a certificate of reexport; to limit imports of 
coffee from countries which have not joined in the agreement; to 
require the keeping of certain records, statistics, and other information; 
and to take such other action as he may consider necessary to imple-
ment the obligations of the United States under the treaty. 
The bill also authorizes appropriations necessary to carry out the 
obligations of the United States under the treaty. Certain obsolete 
provisions of law would also be repealed.

2_ INTERNATIONAL COFFEE AGREEMENT ACT OF 1963 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS 
Under the committee amendments, a new section 4 is added to the 
bill. This amendment provides that whenever the Congress passes 
a concurrent resolution, in which it finds that there is an unwarranted 
increase in the domestic price of coffee attributable, in whole or in 
part, to the application or operation of the International Coffee Agree-
ment, 1962, the President shall cause a copy of the resolution to be 
transmitted to the International Coffee Council and the executive 
board which are established under chapter IV of the agreement. If 
the President finds that the Council has failed, within 30 days after 
the transmittal of the resolution, to make such adjustments of quotas, 
or to take such other action, as is necessary to remedy the situation, 
he is authorized and directed to cause written notice of withdrawal of 
the United States from the agreement, such notice to be filed with 
the Secretary General of the United Nations in accordance with the 
provisions of article 68 of the agreement. Under article 68, with-
drawal of a contracting party becomcs effective 90 days after the notice 
is received by the Secretary General. 
Under the bill, as passed by the House, the President is authorized 
to exercise any powers conferred on him by the bill through such 
agency or officer as he directs. Under the committee amendments, 
the powers and duties conferred on the President by the new section 
4 may not be so delegated. 
The amendment is designed to prevent, insofar as possible, sharp 
changes in prices which would be to the detriment of the American 
consumer. The coffee agreement provides for the withdrawal of 
members and this provision would be used whenever Congress felt 
that high prices were being maintained unnecessarily. The United 
States is the greatest coffee-consuming country in the world and it 
would seem unlikely that the agreement could stand without the 
membership of the United States. 
GENERAL STATEMENT 
The Senate, on May 21, 1963, gave its advice and consent to the 
ratification of the International Coffee Agreement, 1962. On Decem-
ber 27, 1963, the United States deposited its instrument of ratification. 
By so doing the United States became a party of this treaty as a 
provisional member pending the enactment of implementing legisla-
tion enabling the United States to meet its obligations under the 
agreement. H.R. 8864 authorizes the establishment of such pro-
cedures. 
Membership in the agreement does not obligate U.S. purchasers to 
buy coffee from any particular country, to buy any specific amount of 
coffee, or to pay any specific price for coffee. Coffee traders will be 
free to continue their established practices and patterns of trade, 
competing as before with buyers in other consuming countries. 
The interests of the United States are protected by the fact that it 
will hold a minimum of 400 votes out of the total of 1,000 consumer 
votes in the International Coffee Council, the governing body of the 
agreement, and will also be a member of the executive board. Since 
practically all important decisions, such as adoption of the budget, 
establishment of the quotas, or the production control program, 
require a two-thirds vote of the consumers and producers voting

separately, the United States holds sufficient votes to prevent actions 
which might be considered adverse to our policy interests, to our 
business community, or to the American consumer. 
The International Coffee Agreement does not contemplate any 
changes in the traditional relationships between the traders, the 
roasters, and the retailers. Coffee is a high volume, staple food 
product. Coffee price and quality are subject to keen competition in 
retail outlets in the United States. This means that the benefits of 
success if promoting low-cost efficient production, or in stabilizing the 
price cannot be withheld from the consumer. 
The President is required to submit to the Congress an annual 
report on the operations of the agreement, including full information 
with regard to the level of prices. Also the legislation will expire on 
October 1, 1965. Thus Congress will have repeated early oppor-
tunities to review the operation of the agreement and its advantages or 
disadvantages to the United States. The United States may withdraw 
from the agreement at any time upon 90 days' notice. 
The Senate Committee on Finance has added another safeguard in 
this respect by approving an amendment to H.R. 8864 providing that 
if the Congress passes a concurrent resolution finding that an un-
warranted increase in domestic coffee prices is attributable to the 
operation of the agreement, the President is directed to initiate a U.S. 
withdrawal from the agreement if remedial action is not taken within 
30 days after transmittal of the resolution. 
The substantial increase in the price of coffee in recent months 
is attributed to the natural disasters which have occurred, and trader 
reaction to these disasters as described by Under Secretary of State 
W. Averell Harriman in his statement before the Committee on 
Finance on February 25, 1964. 
Wholesale or green coffee prices have risen sharply recently. 
I know that the members of this committee are concerned 
by this and that you may want to know what role the agree-
ment has played in that rise and whether it can be used to 
check it. 
I want to state unequivocally that the coffee agreement 
did not cause the rise in coffee prices. That rise was trig-
gered by a virtually unprecedented combination of natural 
disasters to coffee plantations in Brazil?the world's largest 
coffee producer. First came frost, then fire, then drought, 
and the drought is still continuing, particularly in Sao Paulo. 
That is one of the Brazilian provinces that is an important 
producer of coffee. 
The change in Brazil's crop prospects is enormous. In 
the season 1959-60, Brazil produced 44 million bags of 
coffee; 37 million bags were of exportable quality. This 
year exportable production is barely 19 million bags. Some 
of our officials believe next year's exportable crop will not 
exceed 13 million bags; the Brazilians?some Brazilians?
say 8.5 to 9 million bags. Some in our trade say it may be 
even less than this. 
No one can tell, but whichever figure is right, it is clear that 
a buyer's market has been turned dramatically into a seller's 
market. Buyers are scurrying to buy up the short crop to 
assure themselves of fresh coffee. As Brazilian coffee prices

4 INTERNATIONAL COFFEE AGREEMENT ACT OF 1963 
have risen, other coffee prices have been pushed upward as 
? well. That's the way the market works. 
The situation would be worse but for Brazil's large stocks. 
Unfortunately, they are not all of the qualities that we con-
sume here. Of the approximately 50 million or so bags in 
stock, our trade believes that perhaps 20 to 22 millionL bags 
are of exportable quality. That may see Brazil through for 
the next few years until the trees revive from nature's 
ravages. But the market will be in a highly vulnerable 
position given the possible exhaustion of stock. Conse-
quently, higher prices than we have known in the past years 
of glut?the last 5 years?are to be expected. We're in a 
seller's market, not a buyer's market. And buyers will 
always pay more for fresh coffee than for "stored" coffee 
from stocks. 
? Some say that quotas are a factor, albeit minor in the price 
rise. The fact is that exporters had a system of quotas in 
effect in the year following the negotiation of the agreement. 
Nevertheless, coffee prices continued to decline and reached 
new lows in August and September of 1963. Basically, that 
was because quotas were considerably too large and produc-
tion was overabundant. 
When the Brazilian situation appeared to be turning the 
market around, an effort was made to raise quotas but be-
cause market developments could not be clearly foreseen, no 
action was approved. However, now we have a background 
of rapid rise in prices and large buying for inventories as a 
safeguard against still higher prices. Accordingly, a little 
over 2 weeks ago, the Council of the Coffee Agreement raised 
quotas. Another 2.3 million bags of coffee will legally be 
available for export. In our judgment this will assure that 
the quotas will not be a factor in future price rises, if any. 
If further quota increases seem necessary, we are confident 
that producers would again agree with us and action would 
be taken. After all, look at the vote on the recent quota 
increase: importers voted unanimously for the increase and 
exporters voted 842 out of 955, including Brazil and Colom-
bia, for the increase also. That is an impressive record of 
nearly unanimous agreement. 
Price stability is what we are after and quotas should be 
used for this purpose. 
Although the United States deposited its instrument of ratification 
of the agreement on December 27, 1963, its participation in the agree-
ment has not been effective. This implementing legislation should be 
enacted by June 1, 1964, if the United States is to carry out the 
obligations of the agreement.

5, 
For- the information of the Senate the text of the International 
Coffee Agreement, 1962, is printed below.: 
INTERNATIONAL COFFEE AGREEMENT, 1962 
PREAMBLE 
The Governments Parties to this Agreement, 
Recognizing the exceptional importance of coffee to the 
economies of many countries which are largely dependent 
upon this commodity for their export earnings and thus for the 
continuation of their development programmes in the social 
and economic fields; 
Considering that close international co-operation on coffee 
marketing will stimulate the economic diversification and de-
velopment of coffee-producing countries and thus contribute 
to a strengthening of the political and economic bonds be-
tween producers and consumers; 
Finding reason to expect a tendency toward persistent 
disequilibrium between production and consumption, accu-
mulation of burdensome stocks; and pronounced fluctua-
? tions in prices, which can be harmful both to producers 
and to consumers; and 
Believing that, in the absence of international measures, 
this situation cannot be corrected by normal market forces, 
Have agreed as follows: 
CHAPTER I-L-OBJECTIVES 
ARTICLE 1 
Objectives 
The objectives of the Agreement are: 
:(1) to achieve a reasonable balance between supply and 
demand on a basis which will assure adequate supplies of 
coffee to consumers and markets for coffee to producers at 
equitable -prices, arid which will 'bring about long-ternrequi-
librium between production and consumption;
(2) to alleviate the serious hardship caused by burdensome 
surpluses and excessive fluctuations in the prices of coffee to 
the detriment of the interests of both producers and con-
sumers; 
(3) to contribute to the development of productive re-
sources and to the promotion and maintenance of em-
ployment and income in the Member countries, thereby 
helping to bring about fair wages, higher living standards, 
and better working conditions; 
(4) to assist in increasing the purchasing power of coffee-
exporting countries by keeping prices at equitable levels and 
by increasing consumptien ;' 
(5) to encourage the consumption of coffee by every- pos-
sible means; and 
(6) in general, in recognition of the relationship of the trade 
in coffee to the economic stability of markets for industrial

the provisions of the Agreement, the Members agree on the 
necessity of assuring that the general level of coffee prices 
does not decline below the general level of such prices in

assuring to consumers prices which are equitable and which 
will not hamper a desirable increase in consumption.

Member group in accordance with Article 5, the basic export 
quotas specified for those countries in Annex A shall be 
added together and the combined total treated as a single 
quota for the purposes of this Chapter.

(1) At least 30 days before the beginning of each coffee 
year the Council shall adopt by a two-thirds majority vote 
an estimate of total world imports for the following coffee

countries. 
(2) In the light of these estimates the Council shall forth-
with fix annual export quotas which shall be the same per-
centage for all exporting Members of the basic export quotas 
specified in Annex A. For the first coffee year this percent-
age is fixed at 99, subject to the provisions of Article 32. ? 
ARTICLE 31

reasonable balance with estimated demand throughout the 
coffee year. 
(2) These quotas shall be, as nearly, as possible, 25 per

coffee year. No Member shall be allowed to export more 
than 30 per cent in the first quarter, 60 per cent in the first 
two quarters, and 80 per cent in the first three quarters of 
the coffee year. If exports from any Member in one quarter 
are less than its quota for that quarter, the outstanding 
balance shall be added to its quota for the following quarter 
of that coffee year. 
ARTICLE 32 
Adjustment of Annual Export Quotas 
If market conditions so require, the Council may review

by Members.' 
ARTICLE 33 
Notification of Shortfalls 
(1) Exporting Members undertake to notify the Council

ceding paragraph, the Council may, if it finds the market 
situation so requires, make adjustments among the current 
and remaining quarterly export quotas for the same coffee 
Year, without, however, altering the annual export quotas. 
(4) If on account of exceptional circumstances an export-
ing Member considers that the limitations provided in para-
graph (2) of Article 31 would be likely to cause serious harm 
to its economy, the Council may, at the request of that 
Member, take appropriate action under Article 60. The 
Member concerned must furnish evidence of harm and pro-
vide adequate guarantees concerning the maintenance of 
price stability. The Council shall not, however, in any event,

annual export quota in the first quarter, 65 per cent in the 
first two quarters, and 85 per cent in the first three quarters 
of the coffee year. 
(5) All Members recognize that marked price rises or 
falls occurring within brief periods may unduly distort under-
lying trends in price, cause grave concern to both producers 
and consumers, and jeopardize the attainment of the objec-
tives of the Agreement. Accordingly, if such movements in 
general price levels occur within brief periods, Members may 
request a meeting of the Council which, by distributed simple 
majority vote, may revise the total level of the quarterly 
export quotas in effect. 
(6) If the Council finds that a sharp and unusual increase 
or decrease in the general level of prices is due to artificial 
manipulation of the coffee market through agreements among

MINORITY VIEWS ON H.R. 8864 
The Senate should not hesitate to reject this bill. The chief bene-
ficiaries of the International Coffee Agreement are government 
treasuries which levy heavy taxes on exports, coffee speculators, and 
a few large landowners and the American housewife will pay the bill. 
The agreement is a brew of international politics in which those 
interested in global price fixing are determined to place an unnecessary 
and unconscionable burden on the coffee drinkers of our Nation and 
the world. This commodity agreement substitutes political judgment 
for economic judgment in trying to solve an economic problem. 
The agreement gives some lipservice to the regulation of supplies 
in order to prevent wide fluctuations in prices, but its prime purpose 
is to keep those prices at a high level. Article 27(2) states that: 
the Members agree of the necessity of assuring that the 
general level of coffee prices does not decline below the 
general level of such prices in 1962. 
?There seems to have been a policy established which would place a 
floor on prices, but there is no reference to any ceiling. Article 1 
refers to the objectives to?
achieve a reasonable balance? between supply and demand 
on a basis which will assure adequate supplies of coffee to con-
sumers and markets for coffee to producers at equitable 
prices * * * 
but this objective is at once lost sight of and there is no later provision 
for carrying out that objective. 
In short, the principal purpose of the agreement and the imple-
mentation of it are aimed at keeping prices high. 
The International Coffee Council in London was conceived and 
created not to stabilize the prices of coffee, but to increase them at 
the discretion of the coffee-producing countries. 
The only possible provision for preventing runaway prices is that 
for increasing quotas, and this by no means assures the American 
consumer of fair prices. 
Before quotas can be increased two-thirds of the consuming coun-
tries, plus two-thirds of the producing countries, must vote in favor 
of the increase. Every consuming country could vote for an increase, 
but this would not be sufficient. 
The first test of the agreement painfully proved that the United 
States is powerless and defenseless in that body. It proved the coffee-
producing countries of Africa, Latin America, and Asia can and will 
dominate the market. They can and will reduce or limit export-
import quotas at their discretion, thus fixing prices at any level they 
see fit. 
Furthermore, if there happens to be a shortage, the price can 
skyrocket and there is nothing to prevent it from so doing. On the 
other hand, if stocks become large so that the price might be affected,

44 INTERNATIONAL COFFEE AGREEMENT ACT OF 1963 
or if competition on the market tends to drive the price down, the 
quota system prevents any of this advantage from reaching the 
ultimate consumer. 
Present experience bears this out. There are claims that today's 
inflated price is the result of crop failure in Brazil. Yet testimony 
before the Finance Committee brought out the fact that there is a 
very large supply on band, and there seems to be no question that if 
there had been no coffee agreement there would be an ample supply 
and prices would be much less than at present. 
If there have been crop failures, and there may someday be a 
shortage, than prices at some future date might have risen, but a 
possible future shortage seems little reason for the very high prices 
of today. It is more than just coincidence that prices began an 
inexorable march upward just at the time the international agreement 
became effective. Had prices not increased, then the stated objec-
tives of the agreement would have failed in accomplishment. 
Nothing could be done which would interfere more with the natural 
economy of free enterprise than controlled production, subsidized 
inefficiency, and artificially supported subsidies for large producers. 
Those who know the situation in the principal producing countries 
are aware that the fancy prices now being paid for coffee by the 
American housewife never reaches the worker on the foreign planta-
tions. It is readily admitted that the increased income from higher 
prices for coffee is intercepted to a very large degree by the govern-
ments of the countries concerned, and what does filter through is 
quickly pocketed by the owner of the plantation. 
This is not a program for the stabilization of coffee markets, it 
is a very bad form of foreign aid, camouflaged to deceive the un-
suspecting public. 
Is it not reasonable to assume that the State Department, which 
will be our representative in the International Coffee Agreement, 
would be more interested in buying good will in coffee exporting 
countries than in protecting our coffee consumers? 
If the coffee drinkers of the United States were fully informed about 
the reasons for the great increase in the cost of a pound of coffee, and 
if they understood that little, if any, of the extra amount they have 
to spend ever reaches the workman's level in the foreign country, 
they would be even more up in arms about the new "foreign entangle-
ment" we have entered into. The public should know that coffee 
buyers in the United States are now paying at the rate of over $500 
million per year more than in 1962. 
In May of 1963, the Secretary of State, the Honorable Dean Rusk, 
wrote: 
The objective of the new International Coffee Agreement 
is to stop the long-term decline in revenues from coffee ex-
ports by stabilizing prices at a level no lower than the 
general level of coffee prices in 1962. 
Before the agreement was more than a few weeks old, it had suc-
ceeded in the price increase part of that objective, but it has failed 
utterly to stabilize prices at any fair level to the consumer. 
This implementing legislation, if adopted, will cost the taxpayers 
literally billions over a relatively few years. 
It places-a floor on prices but makes the sky the limit as far as a 
ceiling is concerned.

INTERNATIONAL COFFEE AGREEMENT ACT OF 1963 
45 
Although the United States consumes one-half of the coffee used in 
the entire world, when it comes to changing quotas to affect some 
reduction in price, it has only one-fifth of the votes, and even worse, 
it must convince two-thirds of the producing countries to take a finan-
cial loss by taking the necessary action to reduce prices. The only 
way this can be done, as has been proved already, is to exert diplo-
matic pressure. Such pressures almost invariably result in a loss of 
good neighborliness and friendship. 
The American housewife pays and pays, and the recipients are 
foreign governments and wealthy landowners. 
It seems obvious that the below-normal crop in Brazil has not been 
the real cause of all of the massive price rise that is still growing. Huge 
stocks are on hand and could have been used, and can yet be used, 
to keep prices to a reasonable level. 
Foreign countries have been encouraged and financially helped to 
diversify production. The coffee agreement is a step in the opposite 
direction. If the United States supports price fixing and helps to 
assure a high level of income to coffee producers, how can we expect 
them to listen to pleas to produce a wider range of commodities? 
How can they hear what we are saying when what we are doing rings 
so loudly in their ears? 
If H.R. 8864 is adopted there can be but one result. Prices will 
remain high and continue to penalize the domestic consumer. A 
solid floor has been built, but nothing has been done to set an upward 
limit. 
The time has arrived when we had best begin to look after our 
American interests, instead of trying to assume the burdens of surplus 
coffee producers. in, many ,na,tions. 
The bill should be defeated.

INDIVIDUAL VIEWS BY SENATOR PAUL H. DOUGLAS 
The implementing legislation to make the International Coffee 
Agreement effective in this country (H.R. 8864) creates grave dangers 
for the people of the United States. 
I. THE STRUCTURE OF THE AGREEMENT AND PROPOSED LEGISLATION 
Under section 2 of H.R. 8864, the President is authorized, in order 
to carry out the agreement?
(1) to regulate the entry of coffee for consumption, or 
withdrawal of coffee from warehouses for consumption, 
including (A) the limitation of entry, or withdrawal from 
warehouses, of coffee imported from countries which are 
not members of the International Coffee Organization and 
(B) the prohibition of entry of any shipment from any 
member of the International Coffee Organization of coffee 
which is not accompanied by a certificate of origin or certifi-
cate of reexport, issued by a qualified agency in such form 
as required under the agreement. 
Stated more simply, this means that our Government would be 
expected to be an enforcing arm of the coffee organization or cartel. 
We would not be expected to admit coffee from any country which is 
not now a member of the International Coffee Organization or which 
in the future secedes from it. Similarly, we would not be expected 
to admit coffee from any maverick inside a member country who tries 
to export coffee to us without a permit from that country authorizing 
him to do so. 
Pursuant to this agreement, the International Coffee Organization 
fixes quotas for each country of the number of bags of coffee which 
can be exported annually. The sum of these quotas constitutes, of 
course, the global total. This was set originally in 1662 at 45.6 
million bags of coffee of 60 kilograms each. Brazil was allotted 18 
million bags, or between 39 and 40 percent of the total. Colombia's 
allotment was 6,011,000 bags, or over 13 percent. The 5 Republics 
of Central America were allowed 4.43 million bags, or nearly 10 
percent. Mexico was given 1.5 million bags, or 3% percent, while 
3 South American countries (Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela) were 
allotted 1.6 million bags, or 3% percent. In all, the share of the Latin 
American countries came to 70 percent of the global total. The 
African countries, which have been rapidly expanding their produc-
tion, were allotted approximately 27 percent, while India and Indonesia 
had 3 percent. 
These were the original total quotas. But population is also 
increasing rapidly all over the world, new groups are adopting coffee 
as a drink, and since coffee is, in a sense, habit forming, the demand 
for coffee is steadily increasing. It is estimated that this annual 
increase ,in the quantity demanded at the same price is somewhere 
around 3 percent a year.

?? ?How QUOT. AS MAY .BE CHANGED 
...Now -let us notice carefully ;how the ?quotas .may be -adjuste&and 
changed. This is laid down in article -35, paragraph .3 of the Inter-
liatiOnal -Coffee Agreement as follows: . 
All decisions by the-Council on ?the fixing and adjustment 
of annual and quarterly export quotas- under articles 30,' 
31, 32, and 34 shall be ?taken unless otherwise provided by;. a ? 
distributed two-thirds Majority vote. (Hearings -before 
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Mar. 22, 1963; 
?? P. 20.)' ? ? '? 
What, then,- is-the meaning of "a distributed two-thirds majority 
vote"?. This is defined in article 2, paragraph 11 (Senate hearings, 
p. 8) as "a two-thirds majority of the votes cast by exporting mem-
bers present. and a two-thirds majority of the votes cast by import-
ing members present and voting counted separately [Italics mine.] 
In other .words a simple .majority of . the. two panels of. the exporting 
and importing nations taken either separately or together will not 
be sufficient to alter the export quotas, nor will a majority of the 
.combined two panels in joint session. No, it must be two-thirds of 
. ? 
each panel taken separately. A clear proof of this was given last 
November. when the International Coffee Council, which is the leg-
islative body of the organization, met to decide whether they would 
increase the export quotas as. had been recommended by the execu-
tive board. All of the importing countries voted for such an increase 
and cast their full.1,000 votes in its favor, but only 629 of the 1,000 
votes among the exporters were cast affirmatively, instead of the 667 
which were needed to carry the proposal. 
It is further contended by advocates of the bill that, while a third 
of .the votes of the exporting nations may prevent an increase in the 
quarterly quotas, they cannot do so in the case. of the annual quotas. 
These they maintain, are -"original' ! quotas . and the two-thirds 
requirement of each panel voting separately does not apply. 
? This is a clear and proven error. ,Section 28 of tbe International 
Coffee Agreement covers this point in clear and explicit language.

for the importing countries are alloted in proportion to the relative 
volume of their coffee imports during the preceding 3 years. No 
nation, however, is to have more than 400 votes. Since the United 
States consumes approximately 52 percent of all coffee imported, this 
does mean some scaling down of our representation. Since we have 
more than a third of the votes, we will, however, be able to veto 
changes in the quotas. Had the agreement been negotiated some 
years back when Brazil dominated the export market with from 60 to 
47 percent of coffee exports, the limit on total votes would also 
have applied to that nation. But now that the Brazilian quotas are 
only 37 percent of the total, the ceiling of 400 votes applies only to 
the United States. 
But just as the United States, with its 400 votes in the importing panel, 
can veto any change in the quotas (as can a solid front of the Western 
European nations which import approximately 37 percent of the total) 
so can Brazil with its approximately 370 votes. So can a coalition of 
the countries of Central and Northern South America when supported 
by the countries of the Caribbean and some from Africa and Asia. 
Finally, a solid Afro-Asian bloc, with some aid from Latin America, 
could also impose a veto. 
The conclusion is inescapable. While we are protected from having 
the total exports of coffee reduced by our effective voting veto, we 
are not protected from the exporting countries refusing to increase 
the global quotas in the face of a world increase in population and in 
the demand for coffee. This failure to increase the quotas, or increas-
ing them inadequately, would, of course, raise the price per pound and 
levy tribute upon the consumers, over half of whom are in the United 
States. 
The vote in November within the Coffee Council showed some of 
the possibilities. While Brazil and Mexico voted for an increase in 
global and assigned quotas, the Central and Northern South American 
countries did not and they were able to get sufficient support from 
other areas to poll about 37 percent of the export votes and hence to 
defeat the proposals. 
This is what we would have to fear in the future were we to pass this 
implementing legislation, namely, that Brazil, or some coalition of 
exporting countries, would refuse to permit adequate supplies of coffee 
to be exported even though population and the world demand for 
coffee were steadily rising. This would, of course, increase the price 
of coffee in the United States. And yet while we stayed in the Coffee 
Organization, to whose principles we are now asked to subscribe, we 
would be prevented from importing coffee from any country which 
might secede from the Organization or from any maverick who tried 
to ship us coffee without an export license. We would become an 
enforcing arm of a coffee cartel which, in the face of a rising demand, 
refused to permit supplies to be expanded adequately. And we 
would be helping to maintain artificially high prices at the expense of 
the great mass of American consumers. 
We should never forget that each increase of 1 cent a pound in the 
retail price of coffee means an added burden of $30 to $35 million 
a year to the American consumer. Last March, when the Foreign 
Relations Committee considered the treaty, the import price of Brazil-
ian coffee was 34 cents a pound. On Monday, March 2, it was 51 
cents. During the period, therefore, in which the treaty and imple-
menting agreement have been under consideration by the U.S.

? Government, we have had an increase in the wholesale price of 17 
cents a pound, an increase of 50 percent. This has meant a loss to 
the American consumer of at least $500 million. There are influential 
voices in the exporting countries proposing a further increase of 10 
cents per pound. If this were to happen our housewives would lose 
a further $300 million a year. These are not small sums. The effect 
of such increases are widely distributed but primarily hit the low and 
middle income groups. Their impact, therefore, is highly regressive. 
II. THE ARGUMENTS OF THE ADVOCATES OF THE LEGISLATION CONSIDERED 
But, rejoin the advocates of this legislation, "did not the exporting 
countries show their good faith by agreeing in early February to a 
further increase in the global quotas of 2.6 million tons, or 5.6 percent? 
Is not this proof of their benevolent intentions?" 
The reversal of the November refusal to increase quotas is surely 
to be welcomed. But it should be scrutinized carefully before it is 
accepted as conclusive proof of a permanent change of heart. The 
Council was summoned to meet only a few days before the Senate 
Finance Committee.was scheduled to consider the implementing legis-
lation. There had already been a sharp increase in the price of coffee 
and it was known that there were some Senators, at least, who were 
more than dubious about the wisdom of passing the enabling legislation. 
It was also felt that unless the exporting nations gave ground a little, 
the Senate might refuse to approve the bill which is now before us, 
thereby severely crippling the ability of the cartel to maintain or 
raise prices. In response to a question which I directed to him, 
Mr. John T. McKiernan, an honest and competent witness, who is an 
ardent advocate of the legislation, admitted that the shadow of pos-
sible adverse action by the Senate hung heavily over the meeting and 
while it was not referred to officially, it exercised a powerful influence 
to induce hitherto recalcitrant countries to permit an increase in world 
supplies. 
But once we have passed this legislation, this inducement will 
largely disappear. In slang phrase, we will have been "hooked." 
We will be bound to shut off our markets from dissenters and noncon-
formists and the cartel will have its way with , the United States. 
We will be committed to help the cartel enforce the quotas for world 
consumption, with their consequent effect upon price. 
CAN WE WITHDRAW? 
But, expostulate the sponsors of this legislation, under article 68 
we can withdraw upon giving 90 days' notice. Therefore, if we are 
gouged, we can always escape. 
This may be technically true, but we all know the moral and propa-
ganda opprobrium which would be heaped upon us if we were to 
withdraw. We would be accused of breaking faith with the coffee 
exporting nations of the world, and the followers of Castro, Khru-
shchev, and Mao Tse-tung would seek to set all of Latin America 
against us. The honest nationalists of the countries affected would 
also be embittered and estranged. 
No, the possibility of an ultimate divorce should not lead us to 
contract an unsound marriage. As a matter of fact, this body has 
already been led too far down the primrose path of dalliance by

50 INTERNATIONAL COFFEE, AGREEMENT ACT OF 1963 
previous steps which we have been induced to take by the State De-
partment and by our Foreign Relations Committee. 
-We were told by the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee last year when we were considering the formal 
coffee treaty that even if we did approve it, it would not go into 
effect or be binding upon us until the Congress passed the legislation 
now before us. I am sure the able and honorable Senator from 
Arkansas, who made that pledge, did so in complete and utter good 
faith. Secretary Rusk, also a highly honorable man, made a similar 
pledge to the minority leader. (See Congressional Record, May 21, 
1963, p. 8624.) We assumed, therefore, that the ratification of the 
treaty would not be deposited unless and until the implementing 
legislation was passed. 
The Finance Committee was delayed in considering the imple-
menting legislation in the fall because of hearings on the long delayed 
tax bill. But in December our committee squared away to consider 
the measure. I shall never forget the hectic morning when the State 
Department started off by urging speedy hearings on the coffee 
agreement and then within an hour urged just as strenuously that 
action be withheld until after the tax bill was passed. I do not blame 
anyone for this. Assistant Secretary Dutton manfully took the blame 
for this, but it was obviously not his fault as he was merely the mes-
senger. Then, at the suggestion of members, the chairman asked a 
high authority whether, if we withheld action as requested, there would 
be any danger that the treaty would be deposited and hence go into 
effect even though no implementing legislation had been passed. He 
reported to us that he had been assured that this would not be done. 
The committee, therefore, felt it safe to postpone the hearings on 
coffee and get on with the tax bill. No sooner was this done, however, 
than individuals on the committee, of whom I was one, were informed 
that, due to the pressure of time, the State Department would deposit 
the treaties after all. I was asked if I had an individual objection 
and replied that I did not regard myself, as one Member of the U.S.  
Senate, as being sufficiently important to alter the policy of the U.S. 
Government, but that I thought the Finance Committee had been 
treated cavalierly to say the least and that promises had been made 
which had not been fulfilled. 
Now, Under Secretary Harriman, who is one of the finest and most 
experienced men in public life, tells us that while we are legally and 
morally free not to pass the implementing legislation it is, nevertheless, 
unthinkable that we should back away from the treaty. I ask, there-
fore, how much chance is there that once we have passed this second 
bill the State Department would ever permit us to withdraw from the 
Coffee Organization even though prices were to be raised further by 
the cartel? I think I can answer "Very little." 
Once in, we are caught. ?This is aln-lost our last chance to exercise 
caution and I urge that we stop, look, and listen before we follow those 
siren calls and blindly pass this legislation. 
HAVE FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS HELD BACK EXPORTS? 
I do not wish to impugn the motives of any foreign government. 
They have a right to decide what they shall do. But I was a bit 
disconcerted when the very nice? special representative on coffee 
matters of the State Department pled ignorance upon what the past

policies of -Brazil in the:matter of -coffee had been prior to 1958. I 
have never specialized in the affairs of that commodity or that coun-
try, but I thought I could remember a long line of attempts by the 
'Brazilian governments torestrict coffee exports and to keep up 
prices. 'In the days which have passed since that hearing, I havelad 
the chance to look up the record and I have had the chance to study 
a number of authoritative books and,articles which I cite in a footnote 
and which the State Department and the Foreign Relations Committee 
may find useful in their studies.' 
The record shows that early in this century the State of Sito Paulo, 
-then the chief 'coffee producing center of the world, destroyed enor-
'mous quantities of coffee in an effort to keep up world prices: The 
record further shows that after World War I, the Brazilian Govern-
ment itself took- 'a' hand and restricted exports and fixed minimum 
export prices.? The -record aim; shows that during the 1930's, the 
Brazilian- Government 'destroyed and burned no less than 75 million 
bags of coffee or 4M million tons. This was equal to two and one-half 
times the yearly -world exports. 
' The record also shows that the Brazilian Government has been 
holding back Coffee for the last 8 years and that there has been an 
admitted world production during that time of approximately 70 
million bags above world exports.' Allowing for some coffee which 
has spoiled, there is an admission that at least 50 million bags are 
now stored. in Brazilian warehouses which could be used to meet the 
demands of the coffee drinkers of the world. The record further 
shows that Brazil-governs the amount which can be exported by means 
of export-licenses and fixes minimum export prices. It levies a high 
export tax on coffee and thus the Government shares in the venture. 
The existence of such a huge oversupply of coffee might be expected 
to depress ,the :futures market on coffee: But this has not been the 
case. On Monday, March 9, December coffee futures were 3 cents above 
Spot prices; iiain?,?54' instead' of 51 'Cents. " And the well-informed

While this is-denied from time to time, it is shown in the Department of State's own brochure, "Coffee: 
Production-Trade Prices," p, 2. The world's exportable production of coffee averaged 48,500,000 bags a 
year during the 5 years from 1956 to 1960, inclusive. This was a total, therefore, of 242,500,000 bags. The total 
exports amounted to an average of 39,200,000 bags, or a total of 196 million bags. This left a surplus of 
46,500,000 bags. The surplus for 1961 was 9,100,000 bags and for 1962, 11,600,000. The combined surplus for 
the 7 years was, therefore 67,200,000 bags. This does not include 1963 when the exportable production was 
51,700,000 bags but for which we do not yet have precise figures on actual exports. Moreover, a considerable 
amount of coffee is produced which is not included in the figure of exportable production.

52 \INTERNATIONAL COFFEE AGREEMENT ACT OF 1963 
WILL FEAR OF SPOILING THE MARKET RESTRAIN THE EXPORTING 
COUNTRIES? 
But, it is argued, even if the exporting countries had the desire, the 
past experience, and the present machinery to restrict exports and 
boost prices unduly, they would be restrained from abusing their 
powers by the fact that such action would reduce the demand for 
coffee by promoting the use of substitutes such as tea,- cocoa, the cola 
drinks and by the increasing use of "instant" coffee whereby we may 
get more cups to the pound. But this ignores the fact that while 
there will be some such substitutes, on the whole the demand for 
coffee is relatively inelastic. If the price of coffee were increased by 
10 percent a pound, the quantity of coffee purchased will decrease by 
much less than 10 percent. In consequence gross receipts for the 
exporting nations will be greater. This is the consequence of inelastic 
demand and it is why Brazil and other countries have sought to 
reduce exports and hence supply. The Federal Trade Commission 
in its 1954 study estimated that the elasticity of demand for coffee 
was only ?0.5, or that the proportionate fall in quantity demanded 
was only half the relative increase in price per unit. Such study as I 
have been able to give to the subject suggests that the elasticity of 
demand may well be lower and that the total gains from a reduction 
in supply and an increase in price may indeed be greater than the 
Federal Trade Commission believed 10 years ago. In short, it will be 
to the interest of the coffee exporting countries to restrict the amounts 
they ship abroad. We no longer will deal with a Brazilian but a 
world cartel. And where the economic interests lead, can the execu-
tion linger far behind? 
IS WEATHER SOLELY TO BLAME FOR THE BIG PRICE INCREASE? 
But now an old excuse is being put forward. The increase of 16 
cents a pound in spot prices during the last few months and the fact 
that coffee futures are still higher is said not to be due to the coffee 
agreement and the cartel but to the recent inclement weather in 
Brazil and to the damage infficted by frost upon the coffee shrubs 
and trees. This no doubt is a factor. ? But it is not the sole and pos-
sibly not even the primary cause of the tremendous upsurge in coffee 
prices. Even with the frost, there are 50 million bags of good coffee 
ensconced in safe, weatherproof warehouses and storage sheds in Brazil 
which could more than make good any damage done to the coffee trees. 
But due to the policies of the Brazilian Government and the Inter-
national Coffee Organization these are not to be allowed to come on 
to the market. And if we pass this legislation we will be bound under 
?section 2 of this bill, to refuse to let them be sold on the American 
market should they be sent here in violation of the agreement. More-
over the argument that it is the weather and not the cartel which 
sends up the price of coffee is an old excuse which should be thread-
bare by now. It was used in 1953-54 as a coverup for the restriction-
ist policies in Brazil and was frequently employed even before that. 
There is a modicum of truth in it, but not enough to conceal from an 
observing eye the naked use of cartel restriction and price boosting.

INTERNATIONAL COFFEE AGREEMENT ACT OF 1963 
HOW MUCH WILL THE AGREEMENT HELP THE PEASANTS? 
53 
With all the economic justifications for approval of this legislation 
largely stripped away, its advocates fall back upon another argu-
ment; namely, that we, through this legislation; can promote the 
Alliance for Progress which aims to help the common people of Latin 
America, and the allied claim that it is necessary to prevent Latin 
America from turning toward Havana, Moscow, or Peiping. 
Appeals are being made that it is necessary to raise the price of 
coffee markedly to improve the conditions of the impoverished 
peasantry of Latin America. It is suggested that those who oppose 
any such move are hardhearted enemies of the oppressed, and that 
those who seek to raise coffee prices are, on the contrary, trying to 
emancipate the masses of the people from misery and are their true 
friends and benefactors. 
There is certainly terrible misery and poverty among the peasants or 
campesinos of the coffee countries. In Guatemala, El Salvador, 
and Columbia, which my wife and I have visited at our own expense, I 
doubt if the daily wage during the coffee season exceeds $1?and 
perhaps more often is only 80 cents. Employment is slack during the 
rest of the year. But with some honorable exceptions the rich land-
lords, who in many countries own and operate the coffee plantations, 
have never shown themselves appreciably concerned about the con-
ditions of the people. They have, on the contrary, (again with honor-
able exceptions) kept wages down, repressed efforts at organization, 
and taken advantage of the docility of the Indian population. They 
have neglected the health and education of the people, have resisted 
efforts at genuine land and tax reform, and have not helped with hous-
ing or with the provision of vegetable gardens from which a supple-
mentary living might be derived. While an increase in coffee prices 
would help the small growers, who it is understood predominate in 
such countries as Costa Rica and certain sections of Brazil, there is 
little surety that the owners of the big plantations would pass the 
gains on to their workers. Indeed, the evidence is all to the contrary. 
They would pocket most of these gains for themselves. Indeed, there 
is little evidence that very much of the tremendous increase in coffee 
prices which occurred in 1953; 1954, and 1955 ever trickled down to the 
peasants at the bottom of the social, economic, and political structure. 
They remained poor, miserably fed, clothed, and housed, deprived of 
education and health, and kept in political and social subjection. It 
was the big growers, merchants, and exporters who profited. 
It is true that the governments of the exporting countries profit 
greatly from export taxes which they levy. As the following table 
shows, in 1962, a year of low coffee prices, the governments collected 
approximately $472 million in this fashion of which $360 million went 
to Brazil and $43.4 million to Colombia. With an increase in prices 
the governments will collect more. But should the low and middle 
income consumers of, the United States be required to subsidize further 
these governments where the most important country in this group 
has indulged in very unsound financial practices?

I In several cases these figures are derived, and should therefore be used as approximations only. 
Moreover, the dominant landed and semifeudal proprietors do not 
invest appreciably in their own countries. Instead they send a large 
part of their rents and profits abroad into numbered and anonymous 
accounts in Switzerland and balances in the New York, London, and 
Geneva banks. I have seen estimates that in recent years they have 
been investing abroad more money than we have been pouring in 
through the Alliance for Progress. Excuses can be given for this in 
the fear of nationalization which the Castro movement has en-
gendered and in the galloping inflation which has been endemic in 
such countries as Chile and Brazil. But the same tendency has been 
at work until recently in countries like El Salvador which have had a 
comparatively stable price level and a decent government. Not 
much of the higher income from coffee would, therefore, trickle down 
from the few at the top to the many at the bottom. I am surprised 
that many who reject the trickle-down theory of prosperity as being 
not applicable in the United States with our relatively democratic 
economic and social system should nevertheless think it would work 
in the semifeudal societies of the coffee countries. 
Nor do I place much reliance in the belief that progressive govern-
ments can be developed which can tax away the surplus given to 
those on top and use it for the benefit of the people. I am afraid, rather, 
that the few governments which try to carry out such a policy will be 
overthrown by the dominant economic groups. 
I do not mean that I feel hopeless about social reform in Latin 
America. Reform is needed. It is ethically right. We are trying 
to further it and I have always been a strong supporter of the principles 
of the Alliance for Progress and expect to continue as such. But I do 
say that further to enrich the wealthy is not the most effective way of 
aiding the poor. Rather the increase in coffee prices would levy a 
heavier burden upon our own poor to enrich the wealthy landlords 
and plantation owners of Latin America. It would be an economic 
blood transfusion from the hard-pressed, low income families of the 
United States into the well-fed bodies of the coffee aristocracy. This 
would be the Alliance in reverse. If there were some surety that any 
increase in prices would largely go to help the group in the coffee 
countries who are furthest down, then I think the generous families 
of the United States would be willing to pay a little more per pound.

But there is no such surety. There is no such provision in the coffee 
treaty or agreement and I see at the moment no way of making such a 
provision effective in other countries by a provision in our own laws. 
No, I choose instead to help Latin-America through the Alliance 
for Progress properly conducted. And I do not think that we can 
properly be called hardhearted by the power hierarchies of the coffee 
countries which stubbornly fight social reform, seek to sabotage the 
Alliance for Progress, but want to wring more profits out of the coffee 
crops of the Americas. 
The Alliance, on the other hand, reaches the people who need help 
the most. It is under our own control as regards the amount of aid 
to be granted, whereas the costs of the coffee program would be largely 
controlled by foreign nations. The Alliance, moreover, can be sup-
ported from a relatively progressive system of taxation while the 
coffee levies are regressive, falling most heavily on the lower income 
groups. 
IS THE LEGISLATION NECESSARY FROM THE STANDPOINT OF FOREIGN 
POLICY? 
A final plea of the State Department is that approval of the agree-
ment is necessary to keep Latin America on our side in our struggle 
with Russian and Chinese communism. The coffee growers are the 
most powerful economic group within Brazil, Colombia, and several 
of the Central American Republics. If they are tied to us and to 
the free world by a higher coffee price, it is argued, they will be more 
ardent in their opposition to a Communist takeover of their govern-
ments. The coffee countries will, moreover, have more foreign 
exchange with which to purchase machinery and other capital goods, 
thus helping to industrialize their economies and raise the standard 
of living of their peoples. For us to refuse to enforce the export 
quotas of the international coffee cartel would, it is said, expose the 
economies of Latin America to sharp fluctuations in prices and pros-
perity. 
This last point is unfortunately true in the case of those commod-
ities the demand for which, like coffee, is relatively inelastic. For 
here slight fluctuations in quantity create larger proportionate 
fluctuations in price. An increase in quantity, other things remaining 
the same, will cause the price per pound to fall by a greater ratio so 
that the total gross receipts will be less. There is, to be sure, some 
tendency for demand to increase; namely, for more to be demanded 
at the same price. But when the increase in quantity exceeds this 
shifting of the demand curve, then the coffee industry will suffer. 
That is what the coffee producers fear and why they want the con-
suming countries to help them enforce the restrictions upon exports 
which they seek to impose. If we do not do this it is indeed probable 
that they will blame us and that what is in reality the unfortunate 
peculiarity of the free and impersonal market in cases where the de-
mand is inelastic will be ascribed to us as a national sin. The political 
consequences may indeed be unfortunate. Not, however, because 
the coffee producers will be angry with us, but because it will have 
an effect on the general prosperity within these countries. 
I grant this and I can understand why the State Department 
favors this legislation. But is this coffee agreement the way we want 
to promote democratic attitudes and institutions among our friends

00 INTERNATIONAL COFFEE AGREEMENT ACT OF 1963 
in the Americas? There are many other ways we may wish to proceed 
with this serious problem. I have already made reference to the 
Alliance for Progress and my support of the Alliance as a more equit-
able way to aid all the people of Central and South America. 
It is also true that since World War II we have spent no less than 
$100 billion in assistance to foreign nations. Never in human history 
has a nation been so generous and, I believe, farsighted. I recognize 
that a good deal of this assistance must be continued. But to tax 
the poor here at home to help primarily the rich south of the border 
does not seem to be either a wise or a truly charitable undertaking. 
Some charity should begin at home. Is there an obligation on the 
United States to shore up the prices of most tropical products? For 
years we paid a bonus of $150 million a year to the foreign producers 
of cane sugar. An effort will shortly be made to restore this practice. 
Our consumers are now being asked to subsidize the Latin American 
coffee cartel to the probable tune of several hundred million dollars a 
year. And behind coffee lies cocoa. An international convention 
for this commodity has been drafted. It has not yet been put into 
effect because, it is understood, of justified State Department opposi-
tion. If this legislation is enacted, however, it is likely to be taken 
out of the closet and either approval will be asked of Congress or it 
may be put into effect through an Executive agreement. If this 
happens we will then be charged with a major responsibility for sup-
porting the economies of Africa as we are now being asked to do for 
Latin America. 
With all our proper desire to help other peoples, should we assume 
unlimited liability for all the economic ills and liabilities of the world? 
Can we not continue to be a good neighbor while evidencing some 
concern for the poor and the low-income families of our own country? 
Is a regressive tax on our own people for the benefit of a very few 
wealthy landowners in Latin America the way we should properly 
proceed? Or are there not better ways, such as the Alliance for 
Progress? 
I ask merely that these considerations be taken into account before 
the Senate takes a fateful step which, in my judgment, may be 
extremely costly to the people of the United States.
