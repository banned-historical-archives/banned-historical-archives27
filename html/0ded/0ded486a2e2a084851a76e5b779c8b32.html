 INTELLIGENCE MEMORANDUM
 Communist China:   One' Year After the Ninth 'Congress
 Introduction
 The Chinese Communists' ninth party congress
 in April 1969 marked the end of the most tumultuous
 phase of the Cultural Revolution.  In the ensuing
 year, Peking has shown itself determined to launch
 a more constructive phase of the "revolution" and
 has been largely preoccupied with searching for the
 elusive "internal unity" called for by the congress.
 Over-all, it has adopted a cautious approach to do-
 mestic issues with the result that major political
 upheavals have been avoided.   The regime's most no-
 table success has been in ending violent factional
 fighting in most areas of the country, but it has
 also moved forward in formulating the broad outlines
 of policy on such pressing issues as party recon-
 struction and economic development.  Nevertheless,
 Chinese policy-making is still characterized by
 considerable uncertainty, and many of the social
 and political problems that went unresolved at the
 congress still persist.   The fact that not a single
 provincial party committee has been formed in the
 year since China's new party constitution was adopted
 is ample testimony to the seemingly intractable na-
 ture of many of the difficulties confronting the re-
 gime.   Thus, lingering divisions in the body politic
 and serious weaknesses in both national and local

 administration can be expected for some time to in-
 hibit the effective implementation of many policies
 and the achievement of political stability.  More-
 over, political stability itself is a highly relative
 condition in a country whose regime still persists
 in trying to maintain a balance between "conservative"
 and "revolutionary" programs.

 Leadership Unknowns
 Part of the reason that Chinese policy-
 making still appears marked by uncertainties is
 because the ninth congress did not produce a united,
 cohesive leadership.   It did produce a ruling polit-
 buro and its standing committee, but these bodies
 are composed of men and women who were on opposite
 sides of the political spectrum during the Cultural
 Revolution.  Some were unquestionably bitter oppo-
 nents and rivals during that period, and it seems
 highly likely that lingering animosities have inhib-
 ited their ability to agree on reconstruction pol-
 icies.   The leadership picture is further complicated
 by lack of knowledge about the specific responsibil-
 ities of individual leaders in key policy areas.  The
 ninth congress, for example, failed to produce a cen-
 tral party secretariat, with the result that it is
 still not clear which politburo members are primarily
 involved in overseeing party building.
 2.  Because China's leadership is not cohesive,
 it is something of a misnomer to speak of "Peking's
 policies" or "the regime's goals."  It still seems
 probable that within the politburo there is diver-
 gence of opinion on many issues between "radicals"--
 those who had clearly identified themselves with the
 excesses of the Cultural Revolution--and "moderates"--
 those who were either active in restraining the ex-
 cesses or who were victims of personal denunciation
 by radical elements.  At the time of the party con-
 gress, it appeared that no interest group within the
 ruling structure was strong enough to determine in
 advance in which direction China would move over the
 longer run.   This may still be generally true, but
 the  reason that it has at least been possible to
 speak of "regime policy" during the year since the
 congress is that one grouping appears to have achieved
 some ascendancy in certain key areas of policy-making.
 Thus, moderate councils appear to have prevailed in
 the restoration of law and order and in the cautious
 approach to economic and party reconstruction.   Both
 radicals and moderates apparently agree on the indis-
 pensability of the down-to-the-countryside campaign
 that began in 1968, but, even here, moderate elements

 seem to have led the way in mitigating some of the
 campaign's worst excesses.   Thus, the earlier reset-
 tlement in the countryside of large numbers of minor
 officials---which resulted in almost denuding the
 staffs of many urban organizations--has been replaced
 in many areas by a rotational system that allows at
 least one third of a staff to remain in place.
 3.   There is very little known about the manner
 in which policy decisions are made in Peking.   Radi-
 cals and moderates in the leadership are not neces-
 sarily at odds over every issue, and both sides may
 believe that their interests can be served by a gen-
 eral cooling down of the Cultural Revolution.                             But
 there have been a few,  albeit indirect, signs that
 there are differences within the leadership on such
 key issues as economic policy, party building, and
 military-civilian relations.   The regime's cautious
 guidelines on economic development,  for example, were
 ;issued piecemeal with approximately a four-month
 hiatus between the authoritative pronouncements on
 industrial and on agricultural policy.   The delay in
 itself suggests that there may have been continuing
 debate in high councils.   A basic dichotomy exists
 between those who favor economic programs that stress
 the virtues of political revolutionary fervor and
 those who emphasize organization, rationality, and
 technical.competence.   Thus, in public discussions
 arguments for concentrating on production and im-
 proving management practices are juxtaposed with
 those stressing the need to put politics in command
 of production practices and to allow inexperienced
 workers to participate in decision-making.
 4.   Another sign of division within high coun-
 cils is the implicit criticism of various policies
 having nothing to do with culture contained in cul-
 tural polemics over the past year.   This is a con-
 tinuation of the arcane and indirect cultural crit-
 icism that was a weapon that Chinese politicians
 used against each other during the Cultural Revolu-
 tion.  Many, if not all, of the cultural polemics
 waged this year appear to have been employed to ex-
 press the discontent of members of the radical group
 in the leadership.   In January, for example, People's

 Daily published a lengthy literary criticism that
 implicitly condemned the regime's cautious approach
 to economic development and the policy of reinstating
 large numbers of veteran officials in the party ap-
 paratus.   The'author of the article has been identi-
 fied as a former member of the cultural revolution
 group in Shanghai and hence a spokesman for the rad-
 ical point of view.   The continuing appearance of
 such articles strongly suggests that the advocates
 of more extreme solutions to China's problems are
 restless.   It is difficult to determine whether
 these polemics mean that the radicals' arguments
 are backed by Mao himself or whether they simply
 indicate an absence of other means of expressing
 their views.
 The Restoration of Order
 5.   The efforts to achieve stability over the
 past year did not take hold. until some months after
 the ninth congress.   The immediate aftermath of the
 congress in fact witnessed another sharp upswing in
 factional violence in a number of localities.  For
 the most part, this turmoil appeared to be precipi-
 tated by former Red Guard factionalists who continued
 to be dissatisfied with their positions in local power
 structures and who were quarreling over personnel as-
 signments in the reconstruction of grassroot party
 organizations.  During the Cultural Revolution such
 politically inspired violence had often been diffi-
 cult to curb because the perpetrators had been pro-
 tected by persons in authority in the provincial ad-
 ministrations or in Peking itself, or in both.   By
 mid-summer 1969, however, the situation in at least
 one province had become so anarchic that the central
 authorities felt compelled to issue a tough directive
 empowering the People's Liberation Army (PLA)  to use
 "military tactics" against the troublemakers.  Sub-
 sequently, that directive was given nationwide appli-
 cation and was backed up by another tough order in
 August calling for an end to violence in order to
 facilitate the regime's "war preparations."
 6.   The increased willingness of the central
 authorities to authorize the army to impose order

 by the threat or use of force where necessary has
 been the most important factor leading to the marked
 reduction in serious disorders in China since the
 summer of 1969. There is probably still divergence
 in Peking over which local factionalists to support,
 but a combination of external pressures and internal
 imperatives seems to have produced a greater degree
 of unanimity in Peking on opposing domestic violence.
 The sharp deterioration in relations with the Soviet
 Union over the past year has resulted in an urgent
 need to avoid major internal upheavals and to dem-
 onstrate visibly China's national unity.   An equally
 important factor is the regime's desire to create an
 atmosphere conducive to revitalizing the economy and
 to restore central control over the country after
 three years of unprecedented domestic crisis.
 The Policies of Reconstruction
 7.? Although there has generally been a paucity
 of detailed public announcements on regime programs
 since the ninth congress, Peking has succeeded in
 establishing the broad outlines of a number of fu-
 ture policies, particularly in the economic and so-
 cial spheres.   There is a growing body of evidence,
 for example, that both local and national authorities
 are giving increased attention to economic planning,
 and it appears that data are currently being collected
 for a new five-year plan.  The thrust of most author-
 itative discussions of the economy over the past year
 has been the need for reinstituting central direction
 and management over the economy, although lower levels
 of administration will still be permitted a degree of
 flexibility in meeting their plan requirements.
 8.   Peking has made it clear that a major goal
 of future economic plans will continue to be the de-
 velopment of small-and medium-sized industries in
 rural areas, primarily to support agriculture.   The
 regime's over-all purpose is to establish a series
 of "relatively independent but varied" provincial
 industrial systems.   Most of the capital investment
 in these systems is to be provided by the localities
 themselves; the state will reserve the bulk of its
 resources for investment in certain strategically

 CONFIDENTIAL

 important industries and in the development of mod-
 ern weapons.  This policy involves considerable del-
 egation of new responsibilities to the rural communes
 and production brigades, which will be charged with
 the administration not only of local commerce and
 agricultural mechanization facilities but also of
 medical services and education.
 9.   Since the ninth congress, official attitudes
 toward change in the economic sphere have been gener-
 ally cautious, and the central authorities appear to
 have become preoccupied with the need to achieve a
 satisfactory level of agricultural production--par-
 ticularly of grain--and a maximum of industrial out-
 put.  The regime's determination to avoid past mis-
 takes is evidenced by its quiet abandonment of some
 of the disruptive rural experiments that were at-
 tempted before the party congress.   These included-
 efforts to reduce further the material incentives
 to peasants by confiscating their private plots and
 also institutional changes aimed at enlarging the
 F-ize of agricultural collectives.   While Mao prob-
 ably retains his ideological commitment to such goals
 as achieving greater collectivization in agriculture
 and promoting more egalitarianism in both rural and
 industrial income, the regime's current position at
 least suggests that extreme reforms will not be im-
 posed on the economy until it has been sufficiently
 strengthened to absorb additional strains.
 10.   In the social sphere, it has become pro-
 gressively clearer that-the "down-to-the-countryside"
 movement--the systematic reduction of the urban pop-
 ulation initiated in late 1968--has become a perma-
 nent campaign.  Although there had been similar move-
 ments since 1957, the current campaign is definitely
 broader in scope and seems primarily intended as a
 comprehensive attempt to raise the low technological
 level of China's agricultural production while re-
 ducing the enormous population pressures in the
 cities.  Thus far, the program, which involves the
 rotation or permanent resettlement of millions of
 students, technicians, teachers, medical personnel,
 and minor officials, has been implemented in a de-
 liberate and largely orderly fashion.   In fact, the
 demonstrated ability to shift such large numbers of

 CONFIDENTIAL

 people to rural areas is an impressive measure of
 the high degree of confidence and effectiveness with
 which the governing bodies below the national leve?
 are now able to-'implement some major regime programs.
 Nevertheless, it'should be kept in mind that the
 broader utopian goal of the program--the creation
 of a more egalitarian society--makes many aspects
 of the campaign inherently unstable and potentially
 susceptible to radical influence of the type that
 marked the Great Leap Forward.
 11.   In addition to the down- to-the-countryside
 movement, Peking has shown every intention over the
 past year of pursuing two other of Mao's pet social
 reforms that were initiated well before the ninth
 congress. These are the introduction of a coopera-
 tive rural medical service and reform of the ed''~ca-
 tional system from the primary to the university
 level.   Medical reforms in the countryci:le involve
 the permanent transfer of large numbers of physi-
 cians and public health personnel from urban to
 rural areas, the training of local, semiskilled
 "barefoot doctors", and the formation of a medical
 care system to be financed by contributions from
 the peasants in the brigades and communes.   Even
 though the program has seriously depleted urban
 health facilities and has led to financial deficits
 in some rural units, it appears to have taken hold
 as a fixture of the regime's public health policy.
 The program has probably brought at least rudimen-
 tary medical aid to millions of China's peasants for
 the first time.
 12.   In education, Peking has outlined a broad
 policy of reform, but implementation has been rela-
 tively slow over the past year.  Primary and middle
 schools have been in operation, but the scope of
 their activities, and to some extent their curric-
 ula,                               appears to vary from area to area.   There is
 no sign that China's colleges and universities--
 with the possible exception of a few technical
 schools--have reopened after a three-and-a-half
 year hiatus.   Peking still appears committed to
 the goal of shortening the length of schooling at
 all levels and revamping the academic curriculum

 Approved For Release 20c  6WflVR3&     O875R001100090026-9
 in favor of even more political and vocational train-
 ing.  Propaganda discussions of education over the
 past year suggest that r3form is in process in at
 least a large number of model primary and middle
 schools set up in various provinces.  Moreover, the
 delay in reopening the universities may be in part
 because many of them, including Peking University,
 are currently shifting some part of their facilities
 to the countryside or to urban factory districts,
 where they presumably will be in a better position
 to introduce more practical training into the cur-
 ricula.
 Central Administrative Reorganization
 13.   The future course of the various social
 and economic policies that Peking is pursuing will
 probably be considerably affected by the kind of
 people the regime places in the reconstituted cen-
 tral government organs and the Chinese Communist
 party apparatus at all levels.   The ninth party
 congress elected a new politburo and central com-
 mittee, although it failed to form a party secre-
 tariat and a central control  (i.e. disciplinary)
 commission.   It is possible that some essential
 elements of the central party structure may have
 been reconstituted behind the scenes and could now
 be operating.   There is, however,  little firm evi-
 dence for,  this beyond a few propaganda references
 to units such as the central committee department
 for united front work and a reference in late March
 1970 to the "General Office of the Chinese Communist
 Party Central Committee," the first official mention
 in about three years of this.highly strategic compo-
 nent that formerly served as the executive office of
 the party secretariat.   A major question remains as
 to whether some lesser central party units or the
 secretariat itself will ever be reconstituted in
 their previous forms.  Unlike the old constitution,
 the new one promulgated at the ninth congress failed
 to mention a secretariat and merely announced that
 an unspecified number of "compact and efficient" or-
 gans would be set up to attend to the daily affairs
 of the party, government, and army.

 14.  The passion for administrative simplicity
 reflected in the party constitution has also af-
 fected the, central governing bodies that at present
 appear to be in the throes of reorganization.   Sev-
 eral high officials have said that the 39 ministries
 under the State Council (excluding the Ministry of
 National Defense) will be streamlined, and some amal-
 gamations have been reported over the past year.  The
 process has been slow, however, and no new civilian
 ministers have been named--a move that presumably
 would signal the completion of government reorgan-
 ization.
 15.  Although central government ministries
 apparently continue to function under the over-all
 aegis of Military Control Committees, there are
 signs that civilian authorities may be playing A.
 significant role in at least those agencies respon-
 sible for economic planning.   The fact that provin-
 cial and national media have been referring to pre-
 parations for a unified national plan suggests that
 some experienced plannero, almost all of whom were
 criticized during the Cultural Revolution, may have
 been called back into action.
 Party Reconstruction in the Provinces
 16.   Considerable information has become avail-
 able on the status of party rebuilding at the lower
 levels, and the process, although still slow, has
 shown signs of intensifying in recent months.   Party
 reconstruction did not receive much publicity in the
 immediate aftermath of the ninth congress and seems
 to have made little headway until the announcement
 that a party committee was formed in a Shanghai cot-
 ton mill in mid-June 1969.   Since that time it has
 become clear that party building has become Peking's
 major political campaign, and the amount of public-
 ity devoted to preparations for party reorganization
 and to the activities of newly formed party comirit-
 tees at the county level:.and below has magnified
 considerably.
 17.  Despite these indications of progress,
 party rebuilding at the lower levels has been a tor-
 tuous, agonizing process, and it is likely to remain

 so i'~ the foreseeable future.   The reasons for the
 delays encountered to date are at least twofold.
 In part i:h,  prorr,ss has Y ,,-?en slow because Peking
 has evidently p, f.:,scri.bec] that ioc;n]. party c,i-gani.za-
 tions must be rEtconstructed from the grass roots
 upward.   in practice this means that in the coun-
 tryside, for exatupi,e, party committees must first
 be formed at the production brigade level, then at
 the commune level, and only then at the county
 level and so forth.   Perhaps even more important,
 delay is inevitable because Peking has required
 that the various party committees be composed of
 representatives from the ranks of the military,
 veteran officials, and Cultural Revolution activ-
 ists who are currently holding positions in local
 governing bodies.   In many, if not nearly all lo-
 calities, these elements are mutually antagonistic.
 Revolutionary activists, for example, do not wel-
 come the prospect of having to work with veteran
 officials whom they criticized during the Cultural
 Revolution.*  The result of having to inject both
 old and new civilian and military blood into the
 party committees is that there is often consider-
 able delay while the various components haggle over,
 personnel assignments.  The whole process is fraught
 with political difficulties, and it seems highly
 unlikely that the final composition of any party
 committee satisfies all the participants.  There is
 ample evidence that in a number of areas where party
 committees have been formed, their authority has
 been challenged by disgruntled local officials who
 have been left out of the party.
 18.  Peking is fully aware of these difficul-
 ties and publicly announced last July that it ex-
 pects party building to be "gradual."   Since then,
 however, the regime has indicated that it is anxious
 to speed up the tempo of reconstruction and has taken

 tionalists during the Cultural Revolution.   There
 are other veteran officials, of course, who sided
 with and were supported by the militant Red Guard.

 some steps to overcome problems that have been
 hindering the process.  Thus, it has put into much
 sharper focus the provision made by the party con-
 stitution for the relationship to be maintained be-
 tween the party committees and the revolutionary
 con.mittees--the governing organs established in
 each administrative unit during the Cultural Rev-
 olution.  According to several authoritative pro-
 nouncements, party committees are to "lead" all
 organs of government at every level, and the pres-
 ent revolutionary committees are to serve as the
 executive agencies of the party bodies.   This for-
 mulation raises the interesting, and as yet unan-
 swered, question of whether or not the party will
 eventually establish its own command control ap-
 paratus.   Peking, however, has taken great pains
 to clarify its intention to have the party resume
 the leading role in administration.
 19. Since the ninth party congress, Peking
 has also moved to overcome a major stumbling block
 in the area of party personnel assignments--the
 persistence of factional quarreling between vet-
 eran officials and Cultural Revolution activists.
 This problem has been endemic in most revolution-
 ary committees, and in the first months following
 the ninth congress, Peking cautiously appealed to
 both groups to "unify their thinking" on party
 building.  Last fall, however, the regime began
 forcefully to reiterate its intention of reinstat-
 ing many veteran officials--whose expertise is badly
 needed in the work of reconstruction--and it has
 taken a progressively tougher line against the ac-
 tivists opposing them.   In essence, Peking has sig-
 naled local authorities that former members of Red
 Guard factions cannot expect to win places in the
 party simply on their merits as revolutionary mil-
 itants; thus, if they refuse to toe the line, they
 are to be excluded from the party and even from
 some of the posts they have held on revolutionary
 committees.  There is evidence,
 that local authorities in some areas have respon e
 with alacrity to Peking's lead and have shipped off
 large numbers of activist cadres to labor in the
 countryside.  At this point, the regime appears

 intent on maintaining its tough stance vis-a-vis
 the activists, although Peking's guidelines on how
 .to handle them'are alone not likely to overcome
 serious factional quarreling in many commitL-ees.
 Still,  the chances of forming viable party commit-
 tees in many localities may be improved.   The re-
 gime is now placing much more stress on the impor-
 tance of organizational discipline'within the party
 and seems far less reluctant to alienate local mil-
 itants than at the time of the ninth congress.   It
 'also appears to be more willing to back up local
 authorities who are trying to give short shrift to
 the claims of factional troublemakers to a share
 of power.
 20.  Aside from various initiatives that Peking
 has taken over the past year to facilitate party
 building, the most significant development may well
 be that the central authorities have given no indi-
 cation the army is apparently not to be excluded
 from the process. ' Although there has been relatively
 little open discussion of the precise function of mil-
 itary men in civilian party 'committees, there have
 been ample indications that army representatives
 will be the linchpin holding many party committees
 together.   To date only one provincial radio broad-
 cast has specifically identified army personnel
 serving in responsible positions on civilian  (in
 this-case, factory) party committees.   There have
 been numerous references in propaganda, however,
 to the, critical role played by PLA "support-the-
 left" personnel in resolving problems that have
 cropped up within party committees and between party
 and revolutionary committees.  The tenor of this
 propaganda suggests that the military are more than
 disinterested observers and, in fact, probably con-
 currently hold party and revolutionary committee
 posts.   If this is true at the lower levels, it
 seems highly likely that important military leaders
 are playing a key role in the so-called "party core
 leading groups" that exist at the provincial level.
 Presumably these same men will be members of the
 provincial party committees when they are formed.

 21.  The'continuing importance of the army in
 the party building process serves to remind that
 Peking still has far to go before it can restore
 any political system resembling the tight-knit ci-
 vilian government and party structure existing be-
 fore the Cultural Revolution.  Meanwhile, the army--
 because of its power and discipline--remains the
 primary instrument of political and administrative
 control in the country.   The regime's efforts to
 get on with party building, as well as signs over
 the past year that the military are attempting to
 disengage from some basic-level civilian operations,
 raise large questions about the army's future polit-
 ical role.  Nevertheless, it seems improbable that
 military leaders will entirely abdicate the politi-
 cal power and influence they have acquired in many
 administrative organs at the provincial level and
 even below.
 22.  The presence of the army in politics, how-
 ever, has not solved all the social and administra-
 tive dilemmas that are inhibiting the restitution of
 political stability.  Thus, although the provincial
 revolutionary committees have been demonstrating an
 ability to govern, many, if not all, are still, in
 some respects, beset by factionalism and intense po-
 litical infighting.                                There is no reason to believe
 that the.military representatives on these committees
 are above the fray.   The situation may be even fur-
 ther complicated in some areas because the local
 military itself lacks cohesion.   Since the summer
 of 1969, Peking has attempted to deal with factional
 rivalries in a few long-troubled provinces by initi-
 ating changes in the top leadership, but the central
 authorities still appear to lack either the willing-
 ness or the ability to curb the behind-the-scenes
 political quarreling and jockeying for position that
 mars the performance of many provincial governments.
 23.  Below the provincial level it is apparent
 that the regime is still wrestling with the problem
 of creating effective organized leadership.   This
 dilemma has been illustrated in recent months by
 Approved For Release 200&I'05tZ'5r:W    P8M0875R001100090026-9
 Approved For Release 2QQbiJHWD1T00875R001100090026-9
 numerous complaints in local media that minor civil-
 ian officials are "afraid" to exercise their author-
 ity and are dragging their feet in implementing a
 variety of important programs.   The trouble newly
 formed party committees are apparently havinig in
 asserting their authority over revolutionary com-
 mittees in many areas is also symptomatic of the
 continuing weaknesses in local administration.   The
 party building process itself--which involves a
 whole panoply of personnel investigations and po-
 litical criticism sessions--has intensified exist-
 ing antagonisms among local leaders and has often
 interfered with the performance of administrative
 duties.
 24.   The weaknesses of local administration
 are often compounded by low morale, resentment, and
 some indiscipline among the general population.
 The twists and turns of the Cultural Revolution,
 along with the tensions accompanying Peking's recon-
 struction efforts, have reportedly engendered wide-
 spread public apathy and disillusionment.   The
 breakdowns in regime control during the Cultural
 Revolution, for example, have apparently surfaced
 considerable popular distrust of the system and of
 authority in general.   In an attempt to restore au-
 thority, various programs have been introduced that
 have had the effect of exacerbating popular discon-
 tent.   Thus, peasants who over the past three years
 managed to increase their private consumption be-
 cause of lapses in economic controls are now resent-
 ful of more exacting state grain collections.   Many
 urban dwellers sent to the countryside have had
 their working and family lives traumatically dis-
 rupted and are apprehensive about the future.      The
 regime's efforts to streamline government organiza-
 tions have also produced serious morale problems
 among minor officials sent to work in rural communes
 and brigades.
 25.   Broadly speaking,  the Chinese Communist
 Government has traditionally tried to achieve its
 domestic goals through various socioeconomic and po-
 litical campaigns involving both persuasion and co-
 ercion.  Despite the deceleration of the Cultural
 Revolution and a cautious approach on many internal

 issues, there has been no let-up in regime campaigns
 and,, consequently, in the high level of social ten-
 sion that is their by-product.  The down-to-the-
 countryside movement is an outstanding example of
 a tension-producing campaign, but there are others.
 in party building, for instance, all localities are
 in the midst of sweeping "class purification" and
 "struggle-criticism-transformation" movements.
 These campaigns generate considerable popular anx-
 iety because the future position of many people not
 only in the party but also in society in general
 depends on their ability to come through with a
 clean slate.  The regime's year-old "war prepara-
 tions" campaign--designed to induce a siege mental-
 ity in the country--has demanded additional popular
 sacrifices and renewed demonstrations of "revolu-
 tionary enthusiasm."  The recent anticorruption cam-
 paign, although directed in large part at extremist
 factional troublemakers, also cracks down on gen-
 eral social indiscipline with the result that a
 broad range of people apparently fears imprisonment
 or even execution.
 26.   Thus the regime's methods of operation
 place enormous pressures on the population and prob-
 ably have the unintended side effect of inhibiting
 the ability of the local authorities to implement
 effectively various aspects of Peking's programs.
 The disaffection created by continually buffeting
 the populace by one campaign after another is prob-
 ably compounded by the regime's persistence in try-
 ing to maintain a semblance of balance between "con-
 servative" and "revolutionary" policies.   In the
 economic sphere,  for example, Peking has acknowledged
 the necessity of maintaining material incentives for
 the peasantry by abandoning its experiment of reduc-
 ing individual earnings by confiscating private
 plots?   But other plans for enhancing individual in-
 comes have been roundly condemned in the current
 anticorruption campaign, steps have been taken to
 collectivize handicraft and service occupations,
 and conversion from cash to workpoint compensation
 has been carried out for a number of nonfarm jobs.
 Therefore, Peking's efforts to balance "pragmatic"
 measures with programs that conform to the Maoist
 ideological imperatives to transform the peasantry

 into selfless, egalitarian "new men" create some-
 thing of a "credibility gap" and erode popular will-
 ingness to respond to government programs.
 27.  Because Peking still faces substantially
 the same problems confronting it at the time of the
 ninth congress, the degree to which stable condi-
 tions have been restored to date.is highly relative.
 The violent turmoil and disruption of the Cultural
 Revolution have receded, but persistent political
 divisions and passive popular resistance make it
 difficult to set standards for, or estimate the
 timetable of,, a return to political "normality" in
 China.  The general outline and broad direction of
 a number of Peking's policies seem clearer than
 they did a year ago, but there are still substantial
 gaps in the government's ability to formulate pro-
 grams and to oversee their successful execution.
 Mao Enigma
 28.  Any assessment of the decision-making pro-
 cess among China's top leadership is complicated by
 lack of knowledge of the role played in the process
 by Mao Tse-tung.   His public appearances are largely
 confined to major holidays, and, although "instruc-
 ti.ons" t are still issued in his name, their number
 has declined markedly since the summer of 1969.
 Presumably, he still approves major policy decisions,
 but the degree to which he initiates policy or, con-
 versely, merely acquiesces to pressures from other
 leaders remains unclear.
 29.  The process of party building provides a
 prime example of the difficulty involved in assess-
 ing Mao's leadership.  As early as 1967 Mao made
 clear his willingness to resurrect the party as a
 political instrument. He also spelled out his in-
 tention to staff it primarily with former officials,
 who were to be purified in the fires of the Cultural
 Revolution, along with a selective infusion of "new
 blood" from the ranks of revolutionary activists.
 Thus 1, on the surface it appears that party recon-
 struction is presently proceeding according to the
 Maoist scenario.

 30.   But having gone to such lengths to deci-
 mate the old party apparatus, which he considered
 overly bureaucratic and unresponsive to his will,
 is it safe to assume that Mao will be satisfied
 with the new structure?   The revolutionary commit-
 tees, which are slated to be the party?s executive
 arm, have already spawned a proliferation of depart-
 ments and staffs, suggesting that the new party-
 revolutionary'committee structure may he as stifling
 a bureaucracy as the old interlocking party-govern-
 ment directorates.  Former party cadres have been
 badly shaken by their experiences in the Cultural
 Revolution, but can Mao be sure they will now be
 more responsive to his wishes?  Although revolu-
 tionary activists are being co-opted into the party,
 it is apparent that a campaign is currently under
 way to exclude.many who are regarded by conserva-
 tive local authorities as potential troublemakers.
 Mao himself probably recognizes that any party
 needs experienced administrators, and he may have
 concluded that the former Red Guards have played
 their part and can now be cast aside.   Still, the
 current denigration of their role raises the legiti-
 mate question as to whether Mao will find that the
 "new" party is as "purified" as he would like.   It
 is possible, of course, that to ensure his dominance
 over the party organization, Mao intends the present
 party building process will eventually r sult in an
 unstable coalition of competing party and nonparty
 groups--such as the mass organizations composed of
 former Red Guards--making up the power structure.
 Nevertheless, there have been indications in propa-
 ganda media in recent weeks that strong arguments
 are being put forward that the party must be in a
 "leading" role, never a "parallel" one vis-a-vis
 other organizations.   Thus it would appear that
 there is a strong possibility that the party is on
 the way to becoming once again an assured elite.
 It might even become the same kind of elite as the
 old party that Mao accused of being divorced from
 the Chinese people and manipulated by leaders who
 failed to share his populist vision of the trans-
 formation of Chinese society.
 31.  Even though the Maoist vision has often
 been out of accord with reality, it has set the

 direction of Chinese politics in the past and may
 still be doing so.  At present China is in the
 throes of massive political, social, and economic
 reconstruction, and apparently some of the nation's
 leaders are trying to modify the Maoist goals enough
 to gain a period of internal peace and to ration-
 alize some of the country's political processes.
 To what extent Mao, shares these goals is difficult
 to determine.   Barring any major physical disability,
 he may merely be biding his time until he judges
 that conditions are again stable enough for renewed
 forward momentum in his drive to revive revolution-
 ary enthusiasm.  His more radical followers, who
 enjoyed their greatest power during the most turbu-
 lent periods of the Cultural Revolution, may be less
 patient and may fear that the restoration of stabil-
 ity will further erode their positions.
 32. Meanwhile, moderatevoices appear to be
 dominant in regime councils.  The present situation
 finds Peking making some efforts to back up the
 ninth congress' claim that "victory and unity has
 been achieved."  Unfortunately, however, the politi-
 cal ground rules remain complex and confusing.
 Various groups in Chinese society at both,the na-
 tional and local levels are still-scrambling for
 tenable political and social positions, which sug-
 gests that the process of stabilization will take
 a long time to unfold.
