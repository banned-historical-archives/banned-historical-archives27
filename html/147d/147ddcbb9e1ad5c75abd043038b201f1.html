 (Two years later, Chuck Yeager in the X-1
 rocket plane broke the sonic barrier and
 8 years later in 1953, the F-100, the first
 supersonic jet-powered combat aircraft, was
 flown,)
 ."(c) There would be  improvements  in
 guidance, navigation and radar which would
 lead ' to all-weather flying and the ability
 to recognize the target and hit it accurately."
 (This is readily possible but I must say still
 only partially realized.)
 "(d) We would have long-range pilotless
 aircraft."  (In 1953, 8 years later, the Snark
 first flew.)
 "(e) We would have intercontinental bal-
 listic missiles and intermediate-range bal-
 listic missiles."  (Twieve years later, in 1957,
 we had the Thor and the Atlas.)
 "(f) We would have  earth  satellites."
 (Russia had them in 1957; we, in 1958.)
 "2. We  must have  proper  balance  be-
 tween 'manned and automatic weapons' sys-
 tems,"  (Incidentally, as Senator                     GOLDWA-
 TER intimated, that argument is still going
 on.  The answer to me is very simple-we
 need b9th.)
 "3. We can and must have air mobility to
 move whole armies, complete with equip-
 ment, anywhere on earth,"  (We still can,
 and must, but such an airplane is not yet
 available.)
 "4. Communications, command, and con-
 trol in the new era will be all-important."
 (While great improvements have been made,
 this problem is also not yet solved.)
 This report was truly prophetic, but there
 is much left to be done to fulfill its prophecy.
 Last year Gen. C. E. LeMay directed Gen.
 B.  A.  Schriever  to  evaluate  the  military
 potential of science and technology as related
 to Air Force requirements extended into
 the  midseventies.  That  is,    he  requested
 another f0-year prediction.      This resulted
 an Project Forecast.  The best talent in
 find out of the Air Force was used to prepare
 this report.  The Army, the Navy, and the
 Marines participated. In addition, 10 Fed-
 eral agencies, 70 industrial concerns, 10 non-
 profit organizations, and 26 colleges and uni-
 verisities took part in the preparation of
 the report.
 In the study, the primary goal was to as-
 sure controlled and flexible response at all
 levels of conflict.  In other words, we must
 remain sufficiently strong, militarily, to deter
 all-out war.  If smaller wars become more
 likely, we must be able, hopefully, to deter
 them and if we cannot deter, then to prevail.
 The_ report considered first  the  future
 threat; that is, Communist objectives and
 capabilities. A very important part of the
 future threat is -Russian technology. The
 excellence of. Russian technology is indi-
 cated by their considerable accomplishments
 in the nuclear energy, missile and space fields
 and, of course, in the importance and high
 priority they give to their technological ef-
 forts.  They are presently turning out more
 scientists and engineers than we.  I do not
 believe they are turning out better scientists
 and engineers, but they are turning out
 more slid some of them are very good indeed.
 It is interesting to note that the'number of
 their technical institutions increased by 50
 percent between the years 1955 and 1960.
 The report considered national policy and
 the requirements and restraints it imposes on
 military planning and operations.
 It considered technological opportunities.
 There were 12 technical panels.  They cov-
 ered the most important aspects of Air Force
 technology.
 And,  finally,  it  considered   capability.
 There were panels, on general war, limited
 war, continental  defense, intelligence and
 reconnaissance and support; logistics. These
 were all tied together with a cost analysis
 panel, -an integration panel, and an evalua-
 tion panel.'
 The technical opportunities co considered in-
 cluded:
 "1. Materials:
 "(a) Among the most promising new ma-
 terials are metallic fibers with plastic bind-
 ers.                                                                          They are much lighter, stronger, and
 stiffer than structural steel.
 "(b)  Metals with dispersed oxides.  They
 permit strength retention to much higher
 temperatures than the best heat resistent
 metals.
 "2. Propulsion:  With  the new materials
 and new techniques, we are able to have
 higher tip speeds, higher temperatures, re-
 duce weight per unit of thrust and reduce
 specific fuel consumption.  This makes pos-
 sible vertical-lift engines, very long-range
 engines,  and  hydrogen-fuel  engines.   The
 advantage of a hydrogen-fuel engine is that
 the jet engine fueled with hydrogen. is usa-
 ble up to about mach 6 around 4,000 miles
 per hour, whereas with conventional fuel it
 is  only possible, in  the  light  of present
 knowledge, to go to about mach 3, or 2,000
 miles per hour.
 "3. Aerodynamic development: Two impor-
 tant developments are laminar flow, which
 reduces   drag-gives   more  range-the first
 flight was made in 1954-10 years ago and
 far too little has been done on this in the
 interim- and variable geometry aircraft. That
 is, aircraft in which the wings were able to
 change their sweep in flight. This permits ef-
 ficient  operations at high  speeds,  at low
 speeds, at high altitudes, and at low alti-
 tudes."    (Incidentally,  the  first variable
 sweep wing airplane was built in 1951-13
 years ago and now the next ones will prob-
 ably be the TFX, of which you have heard
 considerable controversy, and  possibly the
 new supersonic transport.)
 "4. Special  weapons:   That   is,  nuclear
 weapons.  We need smaller weapons.       We
 need cleaner weapons so that we can take
 out precise targets and reduce collateral
 damage.
 "5. Guidance: Better gyros, terminal guid-
 ance, and matching will lead to ICBM's with
 CEP's, that is, miss distances only a small
 fraction of  the present, and will lead to
 hitting missiles with CEP's measured in
 feet at ranges of 10 to 50 miles."
 A word about capabilities-what can we
 have from these technical advances provided
 we exploit them  aggressively?   There are
 eight important possibilities:
 1. One  is  the  AMPSS-the       Advanced
 Manned Precision Strike System.  That is, a
 manned bomber with controlled capability.
 (I would point out that the last B52 was
 delivered 3 years ago in 1961.  744 were de-
 livered in 10 years.)
 2. Very accurate ICBM's.      These would be
 counterforce weapons as opposed to counter-
 value weapons.  A counterforce weapon is
 a weapon of improved accuracy with which
 you can selectively take out the enemy's
 military strength; a countervalue weapon is
 a city-busting weapon.
 3. The hitting air to ground missile of
 which I spoke-very precise.  A limited war
 weapon to take out bridges, etc., anything
 that the Army wants taken out.
 4. A VTOL fighter.  That is, a vertical take-
 off and landing strike reconnaissance aircraft
 for army support.  (The first VTOL aircraft
 was built 8 years ago in 1956.  There, again,
 we have made some progress but nowhere
 near as much as we should.)
 5. A VTOL light transport to support the
 ground forces.
 6. A CXX which is a large cargo aircraft.
 I would estimate that this would be perhaps
 two times as big as the biggest airplane fly-
 ing today.  It could go halfway around the
 world  without  refueling.   It  could  move
 armies, complete with their equipment, as
 advocated by Von Karman almost 20 years
 ago.   This airplane is possible and it must
 be built.
 7. Mobile Air Defense:, Through the utili-
 zation of an airplane like the CXX, it would
 be possible to have long range radar, radio
 directed and infra-red homing missiles, air
 to air, air to ground, air to space, effective
 against aircraft, air to ground missiles, and
 submarine launched missiles.
 8. A hypersonic mach 6, 4,000 mile an hour
 reconnaissance aircraft.
 Thus, if we aggressively exploit present
 technology, we can have survivable forces in'
 being which will provide:
 1. Effective deterrents at any and all levels
 of intensity.
 2. Multiple options throughout the entire
 spectrum of warfare.
 3. Capability to respond in a controlled
 and decisive manner.
 4. The ability to prevail at the level of con-
 flict chosen.
 5. The ability to use escalation as a tool;
 we to dictate, not merely to respond.
 6. Manned weapon system with positive
 control and properly selected warheads per-
 mitting: (a) careful identification of target;
 (b) extreme accuracy; (c) the ability to limit
 collateral damage to ourselves, our allies, and
 our enemies.
 7. Ready adaptability to satisfactory war
 termination policy.
 8. Adaptability to realistic arms control
 measures.
 9. And finally, a reliable communication
 system providing absolute command and
 control.
 Science and technology, if we exploit the
 high payoff concepts will enable our Military
 Establishment and particularly the Air Force
 to accomplish its mission of supporting na-
 tional policy.
 The obvious conclusion is that our na-
 tional security and our national welfare, in
 future, will depend very largely on military
 technology and, of course, as always, on the
 spirit and will of our citizens.  Our Nation
 must become and remain superior in science
 and technology.  We must have more and
 better scientists and engineers.  This is one
 of the very important challenges to Penn-
 sylvania Military College and to all of the
 other fine educational, institutions of our
 land.
 Thank you.
 HALF COMMITMENT IN SOUTH-
 EAST ASIA
 Mr. SIMPSON.  Mr. President, no-
 where in the world is American prestige
 more deeply committed to an ambiguous
 objective than in Vietnam.  A distin-
 guished theologian, Dr. Charles Wesley
 Lowry, who edits "The Blessings of Lib-
 erty" for the Foundation for Religious
 Action in the Social and Civil Order, has
 written an excellent treatise on the deep-
 ening dilemma in southeast Asia.  In it
 he likens the folly of our half commit-
 ment in Vietnam to that of our half
 commitment in Korea, and he deduces
 that "it is time in Asia we break out of
 the pattern of inconclusiveness and un-
 purpose bequeathed by the ,Korean con-
 flict."
 Dr. Lowry has authorized a thought-
 provoking and perceptive article on the
 war in Vietnam, entitled, "Deepening Di-
 lemma in Southeast Asia" and I ask
 unanimous consent that it be printed at
 this point in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 DEEPENING DILEMMA IN SOUTHEAST ASIA
 Things appear to be coming apart at the
 seams in southeast Asia.
 In estimating the forces at work and the
 probable or possible consequences, it is nec-
 essary to look before and after, and to take
 a long view.

 The final passing from the stage of Gen.
 Douglas MacArthur, and the ftareup of old
 controveries and issues occasioned by the
 publication of interviews given a decade ago,
 are reminders of the existence of abiding
 factors in world affairs.
 MacArthur was the apostle of the priority
 of the Orient.  He saw with a clear vision
 that as China went Asia would go.  He
 wanted a solution and not a ceaseless stale-
 mate in the Far East.
 He was overruled.  The counsels of the
 diplomatic trimmers and appeasers prevailed.
 The period of living from hand to mouth in
 terms of Asian policy was inaugurated and
 has  since  been maintained.  Melancholy
 monuments of this policy are the partition
 of Korea, the collapse of French rule in Indo-
 china;               the partition (as with Korea)  of
 Vietnam Into Communist and free sectors,
 the attempted neutralization of Lace, the
 appeasement  of Sukarno  in  relation to
 Dutch New Guinea, and the American-In-
 spired overthrow of the Diem regime in free
 Vietnam.
 One should perhaps add, the holding on
 the leash all this time of Chaing Kai-shek,
 for clearly our policy has been not to threat-
 en or assail at a weak point the Communists
 on the Chinese mainland, even though we
 stood behind a "Republic of China" regime
 on Formosa and spared neither money nor
 pains to assist the development of an eco-
 nomic showcase on this Island.
 Things never stand still for long.  The
 maintenance of the defensive permanently is
 a moral impossibility.  This Is the inevitable
 disadvantage of containment as a doctrine.
 It is therefore hardly a surprise that the
 terrible patience of the Communists Is pay-
 ing off in southeast Asia.
 Everybody knows how high the stakes are
 In- this area and this situation.  We know it.
 The Communist high command, located we
 can be sure in Peiping not in Hanoi, knows
 It.
 At issue is (a) rice-rich, relatively under-
 populated 'territory,  greatly  coveted  and
 needed by the Chinese; (b) American will
 and prestige as the standard bearer of free-
 dom in a global conflict; and (c) the control
 and destiny of Asia. the giant of continents.
 The United States, as the result of drifting,
 misjudgment, weak counsel from allies, and
 too deep an acceptance of limitation and
 passivity in policy, finds herself in the valley
 of decision.  We are deprived of the luxury
 of further postponement.  We are backed
 up against the edge of a most dangerous
 divide.
 The Chinese believe, with some reason,
 that we are a "paper tiger."  They, on the
 other hand, have come through the ordeal
 of the communes crisis and then have not
 shrunk from standing up to Khrushchev and
 his rockets.  To them he is the betrayer of
 the revolution, a cowardly capitulationist, a
 collaborator with the imperialists, a Bible-
 quoting psalm singer with the soul of a
 Buddhist, not a true Communist.  He Is also
 "a lunatic."
 Of coure, the Soviets in retaliation have
 called Mao Tse-tung "a maggot and an Idiot."
 But the latter appears to have the Initiative
 in the new cold war within the Communist
 camp.  One indication of this is inability or
 unwillingness on the part of the Soviet dic-
 tator either to master or to get out of the
 southeast Asia melee.  The fundamenal fac-
 tor is Chinese will.              And the well tried
 method of the war, be it remembered, is
 that which Mao invented and which bears
 his patent throughout the Communist orbit
 and the world.  As a guerrilla he survived
 and rose to mastery over 800 million people.
 The American dilemma is severe and is
 unlikely to lessen.  Indeed time can hardly
 be on our side in the distant Asian scene.
 On the one hand, there looms the specter
 of Chinese intervention, If we step up the
 war, and the nightmarish possibility of a
 second Installment of the Korean conflict,
 with  Chinese  hordes  pouring  down  to
 grapple with our thin lines. On the other
 hand, unless the moral and psychological
 tide can be turned speedily and markedly,
 in free Vietnam and in Laos, we shall al-
 most certainly have the ground cut out from
 under our feet and have to capitulate igno-
 miniously by leaving on the Invitation of
 erstwhile allies.
 Predictably we are seeking some middle
 way out of this dilemma, and continuing to
 think wishfully that something may still
 turn up.  What must be done, it seems to
 us, is to take a long look at China, at Alsa,
 and at American Interests.  Then our leaders
 must have the courage to lead.  They must
 decide what prudent action Is necessary in
 order, not only to avert present disaster, but
 to influence the course of future events.
 The Nation Is ready and able for such
 action.  It is surely safer to act now rather
 than pursue the path of appeasement.  It is
 doubtful, whether the time and background
 will ever be more favorable.  Thanks not to
 our own merits or achievements, save in de-
 fense preparations, but to the strains and
 ruptures of the Communist monolith, the
 risk of action is minimal.
 It is time that in Asia we break out of the
 pattern of inconclusiveness and unpurpoee
 bequeathed by the ,Korean conflict.

 THEY ARE LISTENING TO BARRY
 GOLDWATER
 Mr. SIMPSON.  Mr, President, In the
 softly fading echo of the last hurrah
 from Atlantic City, I should like td bring
 to my colleagues' attention a most per-
 ceptive and salient editorial written by
 Bruce Kennedy, editor and publisher of
 the Greybull Standard-Tribune.
 Writing of the Republican National
 Convention at San Francisco, Publisher
 Kennedy noted that "America is at last
 listening to BARRY GOLDWATER."  He said
 Americans are listening "despite inten-
 tional misrepresentation by a press ig-
 noring Its basic obligation to objectivity."
 Bear in mind that this man is himself
 an outstanding member of the press.
 The Standard Greybull Tribune has for
 the second consecutive year been chosen
 as 1 of the top 6 newspapers In the
 United States In the under 2000 circula-
 tion category, and the paper's exemplary
 editorials are among the most effective
 opinion formers in the Equality State.
 Publisher Kennedy went on to assert
 that Americans are "listening despite a
 bunch of liberal tripe about warmonger-
 ing and turning back to the 18th cen-
 tury.                                                      They are listening despite mis-
 guided political columnists who have seen
 no good In what the right conservative
 wing believed and no wrong in what the
 liberals have done."
 In a beautifully drawn allusion to the
 late President Kennedy's classic "Ask
 not what your country can do for you,
 but what you can do for your country,"
 Editor Kennedy  noted that Senator
 GOLDWATER has himself been speaking
 and performing in the context of the
 do-for-your-country remark for a good
 many years.  However, "in the eyes of
 the liberals, the prejudiced press, and
 the eastern establishment, the wrong
 person is saying it.  When Kennedy did,
 it was a masterpiece. When GOLDWATER
 did, It is turning the country backward."
 I ask that the July 23 editorial from
 the Greybull (Wyo.) Standard Tribune
 be printed in the RECORD as a part of my
 remarks.
 .There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed In the RECORD,
 as follows :
 THEY'as LISTENING
 San Francisco proved that America is at
 last listening to BARar GOLDWATER.
 Americans are listening despite intentional
 misrepresentation by a press ignoring its
 basic obligation of objectivity.  They're lis-
 tening despite a bunch of liberal tripe about
 warmongering and "turning back" to the
 18th century.  They're listening despite mis-
 guided political columnists who have seen
 no good in what the right, conservative wing
 believed and no wrong in what the liberals
 have done.
 It has been baffling for conservatives to
 understand this complete denial of beliefs
 and philosophies Just because they were
 espoused by the right and not the left.  If
 the liberals introduced  them,  they were
 progress;  if  the right, disaster.  And the
 press-with Its double standard of press cov-
 erage-has been a willing accomplice.
 The world hailed John Kennedy's Cuban
 blockade.  And although he took It off too
 soon to have Its full effectiveness, J.F.K.
 made his point to the Russians.  Yet wasn't
 this   brinkmanship?  Didn't  this  bring
 America to the edge of war with the Rus-
 sians?                                                                                                        John Foster Dulles could not have
 done it better.  Nor could any action have
 been a better example of the philosophy of
 GoLDwAT= for handling similar situations.
 This was the brinkmanship the liberals so
 abhored In Dulles in his day and GOLDWATER
 now in his.  Yet because J.F.K. did it, it was
 "statesmanship."  With   GOLDWATER   it  is
 warmongering.
 JF.K.'s inaugural statement about "ask-
 ing not what your country can do for you
 but what you can do for your country"
 quickly became a classic.  Despite the fact
 that Kennedy made a hypocrisy of its finely
 stated theme by immediately demanding
 more Federal aid to education, more Federal
 housing, more public debt, more Government
 services and programs, the statement will be
 remembered as long as J.P.R. is.  Yet when
 GoLDwaTEa's basic philosophy of government
 is precisely that, when he speaks of it on
 dozens of different occasions, when he votes
 in Congress exactly that way, when he de-
 mands more individualism and less depend-
 ence upon government, he is accused of 18th
 century provincialism and 20th century ex-
 tremism.                                                                                                        In the eyes of the liberals, the
 prejudiced press and the eastern elements,
 the wrong person is saying it.  When Ken-
 nedy did, it was a masterpiece; when GOLD-
 WATEa did, it's "turning the country back-
 ward."
 There will be a battle over civil rights in
 this campaign despite the honest efforts of
 both Johnson and GOLDwATER to keep it out.
 Republicans will be accused-nay they al-
 ready have-of being against the Negro.  Yet
 nearly 100 years of Democratic Party rule In
 the South prevented the Negro from voting.
 Not  Republican.  it  was  Democratic fili-
 busters for years that prevented any civil
 rights legislation, including the filibuster of
 1964. The civil rights platform that came
 out of San Francisco last week is being criti-
 cised.                                                                                                        Yet the platforms of the Democrats
 on civil rights have always been farces when
 one entire section of Democratic votes be-
 lieved-and  practiced-the  opposite  way.
 And without this section there could not be
 Democratic victories.
 But despite all of this. America. as San
 Francisco showed us, is listening to BARRY
 GOLDWATER.
 Of course the columnists and the political
 "observers" back East, the liberal magazines,
 the poll takers are all predicting a Johnson
 landslide,  And  that   GOLDWATER   doesn't
