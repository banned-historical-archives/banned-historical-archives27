 THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION'S IMPACT ON CHINESE EDUCATION
 Many of the seemingly strange and excessive programs instituted by Mao Tse-tung
 over the years have been the overt signs of his consuming passion with creating a "New
 China" in his own image and likeness. Essential to his dream is a newly educated youth,
 formed according to his self-designed ideological mole. This new youth must be not
 only Communist, but Maoist. Side by side with this obsession is that of making China a
 major world power, and thus demonstrating the superiority of the thought of Mao over
 that of both the "imperialists" and the Soviet "revisionists."
 These passions of Mao's led him to loose the winds of the Cultural Revolution, his
 most intensive and comprehensive effort to date to remold the Chinese people. A
 particularly vital part of the Cultural Revolution in Mao's eyes was the role of the
 youth. In large part, the Cultural Revolution was an education process of the highest
 order in the Maoist creative plan. It was significant that the Red Guards, drawn from the
 student body, were first sent into action against China's educational system.
 The short-term effects were immediate and catastrophic as far as the former
 educational system was concerned. In typical revolutionary fashion, Mao's Red Guards
 had virtually destroyed the pattern of formal education by 1966. Over the last three
 years, Mao has been trying to put together a new school system based on a close link
 between work and study. Major curriculum categories for lower and middle schools are
 Mao's thought, fundamentals for industry and agriculture, revolutionary literature and
 art, military training, and physical education. Particularly in the lower schools, localities
 are being given closer control over education and relating it more directly to life in the
 communes.
 Mao's educational formula may help provide the manual and skilled laborers
 needed by China's economy but, along with the three-year hiatus in university educa-
 tion, may seriously undermine China's ability to produce the modern technology
 necessary for industrialization. Nevertheless, Mao will probably insist on emphasizing
 revolutionary theory in all education.
 BACKGROUND
 In 1949 when the Chinese Communists took
 control of the mainland, Mao Tse-tung was sud-
 denly faced with the monumental problem of
 managing the world's largest population, nearly
 80 percent of which was illiterate. He needed
 bridges repaired and new ones built, irrigation
 systems restored, dams constructed, factories
 rebuilt, and whole new industries. He needed
 engineers, surveyors, physicists, doctors, and elec-
 tricians-in short, all the technical and profes-
 sional people without which a modern nation
 cannot exist, and such people were in short sup-
 ply. Another major problem was that the few
 technically trained people available to Mao were,
 by and large, politically unreliable. They had been

 educated in foreign countries or in China by for-
 eigners, they were almost entirely from the
 bourgeois or upper classes, and many had even
 supported Chiang Kai-shek.
 Adding further to Mao's problem was the
 fact that China's entire educational system was in
 the hands of politically unreliable people. Teach-
 ers and intellectuals were repeatedly called upon
 to deny their bourgeois past and pledge public
 loyalty to Mao and the party. From the first days
 of the Communist take-over the extent to which
 it was necessary to stress the "red" or political
 side of study along with the "expert" or profes-
 sional side was a continuing source of friction
 between Mao and the school authorities.
 The fragile quality of political loyalty was
 revealed in the "hundred flowers" period in 1957
 when intellectuals, both old and young spoke out
 at Mao's invitation with unexpected sharpness
 against the lack of freedom in the new China.
 That experiment served to solidify Mao's view
 that "intellectuals" were an untrustworthy lot.
 Mao's educational and technical planning
 was also heavily dependent upon the Soviet
 Union. Chinese students went to the Soviet Union
 for training; Chinese schools were modeled after
 Soviet ones; Russian textbooks were translated in
 great numbers, and learning Russian was a must
 for higher education. Soviet technicians tutored
 Chinese apprentices on how to build, run, and
 maintain the Soviet equipment installed at all
 major industrial sites. Thus, in addition to Mao's
 other problems with China's educational system,
 there was a potentially serious threat to political
 loyalty flowing from the emergence of young
 technicians schooled in Soviet "revisionism" at
 management levels in the new China.
 During the "great leap forward" in 1958 and
 1959, Mao introduced a number of radical re-
 Special Report                               -2-
 SECRET
 forms designed to mesh the schools more closely
 with production needs and to break down what
 he viewed as the intellectual arrogance of the
 school system he had inherited. His changes called
 for the massive development of primitive rural
 schools to be financed by people's communes,
 instead of by the national government; a system
 divided equally between work and study; a pre-
 college curriculum shortened to ten years; and for
 college teachers and students to be remolded
 through productive labor on farms and in factor-
 ies. Generally Mao's efforts to reduce the arro-
 gance of the intellectuals were probably more
 successful in lowering their morale and talents
 than they were in appreciably raising the educa-
 tional standards of the rural masses.
 Analysis of propaganda relating to educa-
 tional reforms during the Cultural Revolution sug-
 gests that Mao's innovative approach to education
 met with considerable opposition from those
 within the party and the bureaucracy who fa-
 vored a more selective approach to education. Liu
 Shao-chi is now charged with being the prime
 mover behind the opposition to Mao's program.
 Taking advantage of the economic difficulties
 which grew out of the leap forward excesses, Liu
 and his bureaucrats closed down many of the
 jerry-built schools founded in 1958. Thus, some
 22,600 middle schools that had been opened to
 absorb 2.3 million students were pared back so
 that only 260,000 students remained by 1962. In
 the same period, attendance at primary schools
 dropped from 80 to 56 percent. Claiming to cor-
 rect leap forward "deviations," Liu's group drew
 up a comprehensive plan of their own to restore
 educational levels to the pre-1958 period. Stiff
 entrance requirements and difficult exams were
 reinstituted in an effort to raise the caliber of the
 students; in the process, of course, many pf the
 workers and the peasants, who in Mao's view were
 the repositories of revolutionary virtue, were
 excluded.

 In essence, Mao's opponents placed primary
 emphasis on the training of a technically qualified
 elite so desperately needed to run the nation.
 Mao, on the other hand, while acknowledging the
 need for better trained youth, did not want the
 educational process to hinder the inculcation of
 revolutionary spirit. This difference in emphasis
 was clearly illustrated in the Mao and Liu views
 on students' spending part of their time in school
 and part working. The opposition, so the Maoists
 have charged, tended to use the general run of
 students as crude labor units, with little or no
 effort to integrate their school training with spe-
 cific work tasks, as Mao insisted. The better stu-
 dents were trained for the day when they would
 take command over the masses. Consequently,
 graduates were imbued with the notion that they
 should go straight to government ministries, with
 no hardship posts, no tempering on the farms.
 Mao, of course, wanted the students to identify
 with the masses. In his view, the work assign-
 ments of the students were most valuable from
 the standpoint of imbuing them with the true
 revolutionary spirit of the people. Mao believes
 strongly that since the students will one day be
 running China, they must be steeped in the osten-
 sible revolutionary elan of the masses.
 Mao apparently moved in 1964 to put
 China's educational system back on the track. To
 that end he issued a number of important educa-
 tion directives in February and March of that
 year. Mao's defenders have claimed that his direc-
 tives were nullified as a result of manipulation by
 Liu Shao-chi's bureaucracy in the Ministry of
 Education and in the organizational chain of com-
 mand down to the local level. In the fall of 1964,
 Mao reportedly told foreign visitors that he
 wanted changes in education but that his minis-
 ters were blocking his way.
 There is some evidence to suggest that the
 controversy in 1964 and 1965, on the eve of the
 Special Report
 Cultural Revolution, focused primarily on the
 pace at which Mao's reforms were to take place,
 with Mao asking for quick delivery and his minis-
 ters buying delay with long-term experimenta-
 tion. Premier Chou En-lai suggested as much at
 the December  1964 session of the National
 People's Congress when he announced that "in
 accord with Chairman Liu's instructions" educa-
 tional reforms were to come over a "number of
 years." He noted that full-time schools and
 "experimental" part work and part study (voca-
 tional) schools would "gradually" produce new
 socialist: men. Clearly Liu believed radical educa-
 tional reforms were something for the future.
 As much as one year later, in December
 1965, Peking newspapers reported an education
 conference "under the direct guidance of the
 party central committee and Chairman Liu Shao-
 chi," where it had been decided that half work,
 half study schools for the cities would be experi-
 mental for five years and would be expanded only
 after ten years.
 The forces of gradualism seemed firmly
 entrenched, a fact that possibly prompted Mao to
 feel that his new socialist man-throttled by red
 tape-would not appear in his lifetime. The fol-
 lowing spring, on 7 May, Mao issued his famous
 directive, which sounded the clarion for rapid
 educational reform and the death knell for Liu
 and the gradualists.
 ... the student's... main task is to study... they
 should not only learn book knowledge, they
 should also learn industrial production, agri-
 cultural production, and military affairs.... The
 length of schooling should be shortened, educe-
 tion should be revolutionized, and the domi-
 nation of our schools and colleges by bourgeois
 intellectuals should not be tolerated any longer.

 THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION
 AND THE SCHOOLS
 Mao's directive of 7 May 1966 was followed
 up in June with a number of pronouncements
 aimed at the "thorough transformation" of the
 educational structure. Schools were suspended to
 free the students, who served as the core of the
 Cultural Revolution Mao was unleashing; universi-
 ties, middle, and even primary schools were
 closed by the Red Guards. Almost from the out-
 set of the Cultural Revolution the seats of higher
 learning served as battlegrounds for the long,
 drawn-out wars in the provinces between factions
 of the Red Guards. Campuses served as staging
 areas for assaults on local authorities both in the
 schools and the government. The universities
 reverberated with the clamor of power seizure
 and counterseizure, mass rallies and counterral-
 lies.
 In one university after another leading offi-
 cials and faculty members were dragged out,
 denounced, and humiliated for having resisted
 Mao's directives on higher education. Local resist-
 ance to Red Guard activities left a trail of vio-
 lence, bloodshed, and property damage. Mao's
 initial aim of destroying the old order was suc-
 cessfully carried out in the earliest stage of the
 Cultural Revolution.
 The focus of Red Guard attacks clearly re-
 flected Mao's antipathy toward the former curric-
 ulum for higher education. Criticism of university
 medical training, for example, charged that stu-
 dents were educated beyond the diseases com-
 monly incurred by the masses and that books,
 drugs, and instruments the students were taught
 to use were unavailable in the great majority of
 Chinese hospitals. The Maoist prescription for
 that malady was a call for the rapid training of
 rural medics-"barefoot doctors"- in the rudi-
 ments of public health, and to dispatch urban
 doctors, as well as whole hospitals and even
 Special Report
 schools to the rural areas. Such measures have
 served to bring at least rudimentary medical; help
 to millions of Chinese. The low level of compe-
 tence of many of these barefoot doctors, how-
 ever, tends to diminish the confidence of the
 peasants in the regime's medical program. Over
 the long term, suspension of advanced training for
 China's doctors would severely limit the quality
 of medical competence at all levels and restrict
 the availability of highly trained doctors to serve
 as teachers for future generations of medical stu-
 dents. Mao undoubtedly is well aware of this
 danger but he apparently believes that the politi-
 cal benefits of his re-education program far out-
 weigh any long-term problems that may accrue.
 By March 1967 chaos in the educational
 system had reached the point at which the
 People's Liberation Army (PLA) was directed to
 move into the schools of Communist China to
 restore order and to reopen them. It is not :clear
 whether this step was the result of Mao's belief
 that the Red Guards had succeeded in destroying
 the old system and that it was time to implement
 his own plans or whether he simply had to bow to
 his opponents' demands for an end to disorders
 on the campus. Middle and primary schools:were
 reopened, but for the most part the universities
 remained closed. Apparently, difficulties were
 encountered in restructuring the curriculum, re-
 vising texts, and even assembling faculties and a
 student body because of the widespread purge of
 teachers and the practice of dispatching teachers
 and students alike to the countryside
 Many problems seem to be still plaguing the re-
 gime, however, and it is possible that the leader-
 ship in Peking has been unable to reach agreement
 on just how the universities are to be run.
 In March 1969, the People's Daily opened a
 reader discussion column on "how socialist

 The army should give political and military train-
 ing in the universities, middle schools, and the
 higher classes of primary schools, stage by stage
 and group by group. It should help in reopening
 school classes, strengthening organization, setting

 universities should be run." The point of depar-
 ture was Mao's instruction of 22 July 1968 on the
 Shanghai Machine Tools Plant, in which he stated
 that university schooling had to be shortened and
 that students should be drawn from among the
 workers and returned to the job "after a few
 years' study." Articles from a number of students
 subsequently appeared in the paper enumerating
 the advantages of linking colleges with factories
 and farms and of reducing their curriculum and
 school terms. The newspaper discussion high-
 lighted the Maoist concept of integrating theory
 with practical application. A typical example il-
 lustrating Mao's views is the story of the biology
 professor who could categorize flies for half a day
 but did not know how to kill one.
 MAO'S PROGRAM AT THE MIDDLE
 AND PRIMARY LEVEL
 In rural areas a propaganda drive for radical
 reform was touched off last summer, keyed to
 Mao's directive that rural schools should be man-
 aged by poor and lower middle-level peasants.
 Follow-up articles charged that state-managed
 schools had become a special preserve for the
 well-to-do and the talented, and they had ruth-
 lessly excluded the children of the poor, while
 divorcing themselves from politics and produc-
 tion. Rural education has long been a trouble-
 some stumbling block for Peking, in part because
 of its sheer magnitude, in part because of the
 intensive demands for labor in production, but
 most of all, perhaps, because the regime has been

 unwilling to make the necessary capital invest-
 ment.
 At the heart of educational reforms intro-
 duced during the leap forward in 1958 was the
 Maoist theme that schools operated at the collec-
 tive or rural commune level should be financed by
 the peasants themselves as a way of better serving
 local needs, but more importantly, to reduce the
 burden of state investment. In the period after
 the great leap forward, it became apparent that
 rural areas could not generally sustain the boot-
 strap operation envisioned by Mao, and thousands
 of such schools collapsed. In the fall of 1968, the
 Maoists once again insisted that the peasants
 could raise funds for their own schools and ease
 the burden of state investment. In the early stages
 of last fall's campaign, the press featured pace-
 setter units that set up schools without "one cent
 of state funds," themselves absorbing the cost of
 tuition, fees, books, heat, and buildings. Typi-
 cally, desks and benches were improvised from
 stones and boxes, the sheep pen was a classroom
 in summer, the caves in winter and there were
 burnt sticks for chalk. The cost of supporting a
 teacher was to be defrayed by the teacher's part
 time labor.
 ...In the countryside, the schools should be
 managed by the poor and lower middle peas
 ants-the most reliable ally of the wonting class.
 Mao:Tse tang, August 1968
 Mao's thesis did not go unchallenged, how-
 ever, and by the end of 1968 some reservations
 were raised by rural brigades. These people felt
 that communes could not everywhere absorb the
 thousands of yuan previously invested by the
 state, and that unless the state supplemented the
 cost of supporting the teachers, funding their
 local schools would definitely reduce peasant

 income. An accommodation of costs was reached
 between the Mao thesis of complete local support
 of the schools and the former practice of state
 support. The compromise was acknowledged
 when Kirin Province's model for rural school re-
 form was published in May 1969, with the pro-
 viso that the state was to supplement the income
 of teachers assigned to rural schools. Organisa-
 tionally, it is now argued that commune-managed
 schools will break down the centralized and per-
 pendicular hold formerly exercised over rural edu-
 cation by state bureaus and offices. It is claimed
 that smaller schools, closer to work and living
 areas, will make education accessible to greater
 numbers of peasants.
 Discipline and attendance, under this for-
 mula, are to be ensured by forming classes into
 squads, platoons, and companies in the manner of
 the PLA. And the primacy of politics, Mao's
 thought, and the principle of education serving
 production will be guaranteed because the class
 character of teachers and textbooks will come
 under the continuing scrutiny of the poorer peas-
 ants. The teacher now is to live and work in the
 commune where he teaches and be fed and basi-
 cally paid by the commune; as a result, he will
 more closely identify with local needs, problems,
 and production schedules. Student vacations as
 such are to be done away with, and time off from
 school is to be granted only during the busy farm
 seasons. Teachers are expected to do part-time or
 full-time farm work on a rotational basis. All this,
 it is projected, will break down walls between the
 intellectuals and the peasants. reduce distinctions
 between mental and manual labor, and inspire
 students not to hanker after higher education
 only to get away from the farm.
 One of the major changes sought by Mao has
 been a reduction of the number of years spent in
 school. Currently, propaganda speaks of nine
 rather than twelve years of precollege school,
 Special Report
 with five years for primary and four years for
 middle school. This change, together with the
 emphasis on productive labor and political study,
 has given rise to a radical reduction of the old
 school subject matter, with a weeding out of all
 that does not relate to politics or production. The
 heavy workload of the old-style schools hacl only
 ruined the health and eyesight of students, ac-
 cording to the Maoists. The new schools are to
 pare the 17 or more courses into four or five basic
 categories: Mao's thought, fundamentals for in-
 dustry and agriculture, revolutionary literature
 and art, military training, and physical education.
 New textbooks are being compiled by the
 peasants themselves, and best sellers tend to run
 heavily to Mao-Lin quotations, recollections of
 blood and tears from the old society and how to
 raise pigs for the new. The Chinese version of
 -Dick and Jane" is to be scratched in favor of
 math books featuring the greed of landlords and
 courses in commune accounting. Geograph' is to
 highlight such pertinent lessons as Sino-Soviet
 border clashes, and history is to instill revolution-
 ary vigilance by recalling Japanese atrocities.

 Considerable emphasis is placed upon inte-
 grating theory with practice where production is
 concerned. Students are sent to both factory and
 field to experience on-the-job training. The farms
 have set up their own factories to facilitate the
 learning process. The old ways-drawing pictures
 of rice on the blackboard, students moving from
 book to book-is repudiated. Critics of the mass
 schools are reminded that such schools meet mass
 needs, and that even if the peasants do not know
 many Chinese characters, they get a good grasp
 on farm production.
 In recent months there has also been a news-
 paper discussion on the relevance of foreign lan-
 guage study for rural schools. Some contend that
 foreign languages are needed to promote science
 and production and to convey China's revolution-
 ary experience abroad. Others gruffly deny the
 relevance of foreign language study in rural areas,
 maintaining it is useless for the vast majority of
 peasants and that translation and the conveying

 URBAN SCHOOLS PLACED
 UNDER FACTORY CONTROL
 Press and radio discussion of urban school
 reforms has followed a similar pattern, calling for
 nine-year schools, a simplified curriculum, and
 emphasis on politics and production-oriented
 training. To this end, worker propaganda teams
 from nearby factories, with the support of PLA
 units, have moved in to take control over city
 schools since last summer. Maoist propaganda
 claims that in this way the working class is shat-
 tering the ascendancy of intellectuals in the
 school system and making the schools more re-
 sponsive to the needs of the party, industry, and
 agriculture.
 Reforms are aimed at greatly reducing ad-
 ministrative personnel. Under the new system, the

 In carrying out the proletarian revolution in
 education, it is essential to have working class
 leadership; it is essential for the masses of
 workers to take part and, in cooperation with
 Liberation Army fighters, bring about a revolu-
 tionary three-in-one combination, together with
 the activists among the students, teachers, and
 workers in the schools who are determined to
 carry the proletarian revolution in education
 through to the end. The worker propaganda
 teams should stay permanently in the schools
 and take part in fulfilling all the tasks in the
 schools of struggle-criticism-transformation, and
 they will always lead the schools....
 Mao Tse-tung, August 1968
 serve concurrently as chairmen of school commit-
 tees, and, in some areas at least, revolutionary
 committees for schools have been dissolved.
 Under the old system, intellectuals were too
 "concentrated": new reforms call for more
 schools on a dispersed basis.
 Factories also assume the funding responsi-
 bility of the new schools under their jurisdiction.
 Because teachers and students are to be integrated
 into the controlling factory's production sched-
 ule, schools will shed their former "consumer"
 status and become producers. Not only is labor
 input of teachers and students slated to defray
 school costs, it is also expected to build surplus
 capital for the state. A few newspaper articles
 even question the need of the old structural
 apparatus, such as the bureaus and offices of the
 former Ministry of Education.
 Urban schools are to establish close organiza-
 tional ties not only with factories but also with
 nearby farms and military units, so that a student
 may foster the all around productive and discipli-
 nary traits of the new socialist man. Teacher
 shortages that result from the increased number
 Special Report
 of schools and the frequent rotation of job assign-
 ments are to be met by calling on local peasants
 or soldiers for help, or by calling out retired
 workers.
 Initially, urban students were doing three
 days of manual labor and attending school three
 days a week, but the system apparently was modi-
 fied in some areas to a four to two ratio in favor
 of schoolwork. This is another reflection, per-
 haps. of continued pulling and hauling within the
 leadership over Mao's new programs. A typical
 breakdown of a 24-hour school week gives 12
 hours to Mao study, 4 hours to industry-agri-
 culture, 4 hours to revolutionary literature and
 art, 2 hours to military training, and 2 hours to
 miscellaneous studies. Again, curriculum reform
 demands that subject matter be keyed tQ local
 production needs, whether it be tea farm or
 foundry. Physics and chemistry are to be taught
 primarily as they relate to chemical fertilizer,
 water conservation, or the steel mill-not, in an
 abstract or theoretical way. Textbook reforin will
 teach students how to lay and repair electrical
 lines, rather than the theory of its operation.
 Courses in middle school physics-such as the
 history of the neutron-may be dropped as pedan-
 tic or irrelevant.

 Evidence that considerable debate over the
 new Mao program is still going on appears even in
 the Chinese press. A few participants in the press
 debate have expressed concern that the burden of
 administering and funding schools might hinder
 rather than promote factory production. One
 answer to this problem has been to effect a divi-
 sion of labor, with factories assuming responsi-
 bility for middle schools and neighborhood asso-
 ciations administering the primary schools. Some
 see the activities of neighborhood associations to
 administer school districts as a step toward devel-
 oping "urban communes"-the collective living
 experiment that fizzled quickly in 1960. Other
 critics view the neighborhood associations as not
 representative of "working class" leadership; this
 view is in turn criticized as impugning the class
 character of party organs in the association. More-
 over, some urban residents object to efforts by
 the neighborhood associations to use after-school
 hours to indoctrinate their children, complaining
 that these activities diminish the children's contri-
 bution to family income. Proponents of after-
 hours indoctrination claim that the associations
 guard children against class enemies, who are par-
 ticularly active after normal school hours.
 PROBLEMS IN IMPLEMENTING REFORMS
 Once having broken the former discipline of
 the old order, many students are now resisting
 efforts to reimpose some sort of authority and
 regimen in the schools. During the cultural revolu-
 tion Maoists gave students license to denounce
 and ridicule their teachers boldly. More recently,
 seeking to rehabilitate and reaffirm the role of the
 teacher, the Maoists have been confronted with
 an authority crisis of their own making. Newly
 rehabilitated teachers are clearly reluctant to
 impose discipline, assign necessary homework, or
 give exams for fear of renewed criticism from
 their students or for fear of being charged with
 "restoring the old." Teachers of this stripe have
 been discovered teaching only political tracts,
 Special Report
 even supplanting legitimate academic study with
 "Mao-study" to curry favor. Other teachers
 assume the attitude that their profession is not
 worthwhile, that there is more money in pushing
 a cart; they hide themselves on farm or in factory,
 disowning the fact they are teachers.
 There are students, too, who have become
 disillusioned with the need to study when they
 know they are destined for simple farm or factory
 work, and some refuse to return to school. Other
 students equate the call to resume classwork with
 a return to reaction; they feel they should remain
 free to bombard their teachers at any time. Still
 others study only political subjects and dismiss
 mathematics and troublesome subjects as reac-
 tionary. They come and go as they please, ignore
 revolutionary discipline, and practice anarchy.
 One senses that the gulf between such students
 and the "liberated" teachers is quite broad.
 The worker propaganda teams sent into the
 schools have experienced problems, too. Workers
 find the rehabilitation of schools a long and
 thankless task. With a factory job, one sees results
 in eight hours, but to remold a stubborn cadre
 might take more than three months. Provincial
 newspapers upbraid those teams and revolution-
 ary committees who tend to postpone educa-
 tional work as bothersome or of low priority, or
 who wait and see what higher authorities recom-
 mend or what neighboring units initiate. Then
 there are schools that have viewed the teams'
 arrival with hostility, spreading rumors to the
 effect that the teams can only be temporary be-
 cause they are too simple-minded to sustain con-
 trol. Others say that the teams represent a "loss
 of freedom" for the school, that the teams have
 come to seize power from the school's revolu-
 tionary committee.
 OUTLOOK
 There appears to be little doubt that, for the
 near terns, China's schools will be run ostensibly

 the way Mao says they should, with primary
 emphasis on a pragmatic melding of formal
 schooling and practical labor. Mao's goal of pro-
 ducing a generation of both "red" and "expert"
 youths, however, faces formidable obstacles. Over
 the short run, Mao's formula for training the
 youth may pay dividends for an economy that
 has a great need for manual and skilled laborers.
 It will also accomplish Mao's intention of thor-
 oughly intimidating China's professional teachers
 and thus make them more submissive to his direc-
 tives. The loss already of three years of higher
 education, however, is bound to have been a
 setback to the training of the scientific and tech-
 nical personnel needed to sustain economic and
 military hardware development.
 Mao obviously felt that the school system as
 it existed prior to the Cultural Revolution did not
 Special Report
 meet the needs of the state he envisioned. Initi-
 ally the schools, like the economy, were heavily
 dependent on Soviet aid and experience. When
 Mao embarked on a policy of national self-reli-
 ance in the economic realm after the leap for-
 ward, he suspected that the schools had not fol-
 lowed suit; they were graduating more Soviet-
 oriented scientists and technicians than the newly
 "independent" economy could usefully absorb.
 In this sense Mao's educational reforms were
 aimed at striking a balance between China's
 immediate economic needs and its more sophisti-
 cated, long-range aspirations. Ultimately, though,
 if Peking is to modernize a relatively primitive
 economy, it must look to outside experience in
 science and technology. For the future, the
 schools are likely to win Mao's favor in direct
 proportion to their success in Sinifying foreign
 technology.
