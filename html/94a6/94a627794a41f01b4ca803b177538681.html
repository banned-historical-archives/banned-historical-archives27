DC1 BRIEFING 
COMMUNIST CHINA 
12 September 1966 
I. The internal political scene in Communist 
China has been marked by turmoil and disarray 
for many months now. All of the indications 
are that the situation is still unstable, 
and there may be further upheavals. 
A. For the past month, mobs of rampaging 
teenagers of the so-called Red Guard hav. 
kept the coun-::ry in a state of disord2r 
1. They have been roaming the streets 
of all major Chinese cities, 
harassing sly:Tected enemies of the 
regime and occasionally beating them 
up. 
2. There have been a few reports of 
extensive violence and bloodshed, 
but for the most part the Red Cnares 
appear to be a disciplined and well-
controlled organization. 
3. In the past week their activities 
have subsided somewhat. 
B. The destructive antics of these teepagers 
have tended to divert public attenticn 
from far more important developments

within the party leadership. It appears 
to us that the top power structure of the 
party is undergoing its most massive 
shake-up in the history of the Chinese 
Communist regime. 
(BRIEFING BOARD, CHICOM LEADERSHIP) 
II. Last month, massive demonstrations in Peking on 
the 18th and 31st of August featured what 
appears to be a new line-up of the party's 
top policy-making body, the politburo. 
A. Mao Tse-tung still dominates the leadership, 
but Defense Minister Lin Piao has taken 
the place of Mao's long-time deputy, 
Liu Shao-chi. 
1. Liu has been the titular chief of 
state. There has been no announce-
ment that he has lost that position, 
and he is still a member of the 
politburo, but he has been dropped 
ignominiously from second to eighth 
place. 
B. As for Mao himself, we are not sure just 
how much control he still exercises over 
day-to-day events, or how long he will last 
1. He was completely out of public view 
- 2 -

last winter and spring for nearly 
six months, and we are convinced 
that he was seriously ill for at 
least part of that period. 
2. Peking propaganda has been working 
hard to portray Mao as a healthy 
man--capable, for instance, of long 
swims in the Yangtze river. Foreign 
visitors who saw him this summer, 
however, say that he did not look 
well at all. 
3. A competent medical doctor who saw 
Mao has reported that he had the 
appearance of a man recovering from 
a serious illness or an operation. 
Mao's new deputy, Lin Piao, is not in much 
better health. 
A. Lin is one of the youngest men in the polit-
buro at 59, but he has been ill for much 
of the past 30 years, probably with 
tuberculosis. 
1. 
This would still mean that he must 
limit his working hours, rest a great 
deal, and take long vacations, in order 
25X1B 
to prevent a recurrence.

2. His life expectancy is probably not 
much more than five years. 
IV. Mao, however, appears to have chosen Lin to be 
his successor in spite of Lin's frailty. We 
think this must reflect Mao's growing mistrust 
of other elements of the leadership. 
A. Perhaps the most significant aspect of 
the recent changes has been the break-up 
of the group of leaders which had been 
running the party machinery for the past 
decade. 
1. Liu Shao-chi was the leading member 
of that group. 
2. Many other members have been demoted 
or dismissed, including Peng Chen, 
another senior politburo member and 
the Mayor of Peking; the party pro-
paganda chief, Lu Ting-i; and the man 
responsible for the secret police, 
Lo Jui-ching. 
B. Military leaders close to Lin, and govern-
ment figures like Chou En-lai have risen 
in importance. 
V. For many years now, it had appeared to us that 
the leaders of the party machinery--men like 
Liu Shao-chi--enjoyed Mao's full trust.

A. They not only had a long record of personal 
loyalty to Mao; their radical approach 
was also in accord with his. 
B. This situation presents us with a puzzling 
contradiction, tspecially in regard to 
its policy implications: 
1. Mao is apparently intent on pushing 
through a radical program to reshape 
Chinesc society. It appears to be so 
radical that the party rank-and-file 
could not be trusted to carry it out. 
The Red Guard had to be created. 
2. There is, therefore, no satisfactory 
explanation for Mao's willingness to 
turn against his old comrades who 
appeared to share his radical views. 
3. The government administrators and 
economic specialists who have been 
retained or even promoted--men like 
Chou En-lai, Chen Yun, and Li Fu-chun--
are the relatively moderate members of 
the politburo. 
4. Yet these moderates are now the nen 
who presumably will be helping Mao and 
Lin Piao to implement the radical program. 
VI. As I have said, the situation appears to be highly 
unstable. The events of the past ten months must

have intensified the antagonisms and mistrust 
among those leaders who have survived the 
purge. 
A. The possibility has increased that when 
Mao finally does go, the succession will 
be disorderly, and marked by factional 
struggles and bloody purges. 
B. It is also far from clear whether or not 
the new leaders are going to institute 
any major changes in domestic or foreign 
policy. 
C. There has, however, been no change in the 
basic hard-line nature of the men at the 
top. As a result, we foresee no abrupt 
change in Peking's policy of implacable 
hostility toward the United States. 
FOREICN POLICY) 
I. In general, the Peking leaders have been so 
pre-occupied with troubles at home that they 
have been marking time on foreign policy. 
Vietnam 
On Vietnam, Peking con. hues to repeat its 
familiar hard line. At the same time, the 
Chinese are carefully avoiding any expansion 
of their commitment to hel:) the North Viet-
namese.

A. The first U. S. attacks on North Vietnam'p 
POL storage facilities on Tune 29th pro-
vided a short-lived barrage of propa-
ganda. 
1. Peking tried to convey the impression 
that China was more determined than 
evak to assist Hanoi in resisting 
this new escalation. 
2. But the Chinese declarations of 
"resolute support" for the Vietnamese 
did not exhibit the ring of enthusi-
asm that had marked similar state-
ments on the 'subject a year ago. The 
emphasis was on self-reliance by the 
Vietnamese. 
B. Peking, however, appears to be just as 
determined as ever that the North Viet-
namese must continue the war. 
1. After the September 7th meeting of 
the U.S.and Chinese Communist ambassa-
dors in Warsaw, the Chinese Ambassador 
released a statement attacking what he 
called the "U.S. peace talks swindle."

2. Ambassador Wang reiterated Peking's 
adamant opposition to negotiations on 
Vietnam, and asserted once again that 
China--"the great rear area"--would 
support Hanoi's struggle against the 
U.S. to the end. 
Sino-Soviet Relations  
III. The Sino-Soviet dispute has flared up again, 
but there is no indication that this marks a 
significant change in relations between the 
two countries. 
A. Mass demonstrations by Red Guards outside 
the Soviet Embassy in Peking on August 
29th and 30th were evidently intended 
as a reply to a Soviet diplomatic note 
delivered on August 26th which had pro-
tested earlier "acts of hooliganism" com-
mitted by the Red Guards in the vicinity 
of the embassy. 
1. The Chinese took care, however, to 
prevent the thousands of people who 
took part in the demonstrations from 
getting out of hand and damaging the 
Soviet Etbassy.

Approved Forlaelease 2SE/62R1ETA-RDP7990827A000400080004-2 
2. This suggests that Peking is not willing 
to push the Soviets too far. 
B. Peking's most recent blast at Moscow was a 
People's Daily article on September 8th 
which accused Moscow of collaborating with 
the U.S. to "sell out the Vietnamese." 
1. The article called the Soviets "rene-
gades," "termites of the working class," 
and "scum in the revolutionary ranks." 
Pakistan  
IV. Peking has continued to supply military assist-
ance to Pakistan, including MIG aircraft, tanks 
and artillery. China's willingness to provide 
this equipment demonstrates the value Peking 
puts on its ties with Rawalpindi. 
A. The Chinese apparently see this aid as the 
price they must pay to keep alive a marriage 
of convenience which is based largely on a 
common antipathy to India. 
1. They believe that their military aid 
will increase the tension between 
Pakistan and India. 
B. The Chinese also know that their support 
causes strains between Ayub and the

United States, and complicates Soviet 
efforts to follow up the Tashkent declara-
tion and increase Moscow's influence in 
the sub-continent. 
North Korea  
V. China has lost considerable ground to the 
Soviet Union in North Korea. 
A. The Korean Communists, long among Peking's 
staunchest supporters, have been edging 
toward Moscow recently. They are in-
creasingly critical of certain Chinese 
policies, particularly those dealing with 
Vietnam. 
B. Peking and Pyongyang have avoided attacking 
each other publicly by name, but the 
growing coolness in relations was pointed 
up at the ceremonies in July marking the 
fifth anniversary of the Chinese-Korean 
treaty of friendship and mutual assistance. 
C. Pyongyang's clearest and most explicit 
public declaration of independence from 
Peking came on August 12, when Nodong  
Sinmun endorsed Moscow's call for united 
bloc action on Vietnam.

(MILITARY POTENTIAL)  
I. To take a brief look at Communist Chinese 
military potential--There is considerable 
evidence that China is trying to develop 
.,...mg..02?4,?*., 
advanced weapons just as fast as it can. 
A. Communist China lags far behind the 
industrialized nations of the world 
in major fields of science and technology. 
The Chinese are not going to have these 
advanced weapons systems ready overnight, 
no matter what priority they give them. 
B. Nevertheless, the Chinese have been able 
to detonate three nuclear devices and 
undertake the development of a medium-
range ballistic missile. 
1. They have done this by allocating 
a major share of all scientific 
resources to the weapons programs. 
2. This has seriously retarded the 
growth of a strong technical base 
for the broader needs of the economy. 
II. The Chinese military modernization program 
still in its early stares. 
A. For several years to come, the milita-.-y 
power of Communist China will derive

primarily from the numerical strength 
of its enormous ground forces--about 
3,000,000 men--and its tremendous reserves 
of manpower. 
B. The army has demonstrated its ability 
to move and fight with primitive transpor-
tation and logistic support. 
C. If the Chinese were not faced with major 
opposition from a great power, they could 
probably quickly overrun any of their 
mainland neighbors in Southeast Asia or 
Korea. 
D. If it came to all-out warfare against any 
modern military machine, however, the 
Chinese would be badly hampered by short-
ages of armor, helvy ordance, mechanized 
transport, and POL. 
II. The Chinese Air Fo7ce and Navy are oriented 
primarily toward d-fenze. 
A. The bulk of the j3t fighter force consists 
of 1,600 MIC-15s snd MIC-17s which were 
obtained 10 years ago or even earlier. 
1. In the pa3t two years, however, the 
Chinese have begun assembling MIC-19s 
in a Shenyang aircraft plant which 
was supnlied by the Soviet Union 
before 1960.

2. As a result, the Chinese Communists 
have not only been able to supply 
MIG-19s to Pakistan, but have 
? 
increased their own holdings of this 
high-performance, twin-engine jet 
from 150 aircraft to about 350. 
B. The Chinese are continuing to place a high 
priority on the coastruction of submarines. 
1. The Chinese Communist Navy now has 
26 submarines of the medium-range 
W or R-cU.ss. Two or three new units 
will probaby be built each year for 
the next fev years. 
Deployment ]11 outh China  
IV. Because of the possibility of Chinese involve-
ment in the Vietnamese war, we of course watch 
the South China border area very carefully for 
any signs of a ground force build-up there. 
A. There are already about 480,000 troops 
in South China, f)t, they have been thereA 
for some time, alm only about 100,000 
are near the North Vietnamese border. 
1. There has been no evidence so far 
of any significant build-up. 
B. Peking has, howevcr, sent a considerable 
force of engineer and support units into 
North Vietnam.

DCI BRIEFING FOR 
VIETNAM 
12 September 1966 
I. The Free World forces in South Vietnam are 
continuing to maintain the pressure on the 
Communists which has so far prevented the 
development of a major Viet Cong offensive 
during the monsoon season. 
A. We have been able to launch a series 
of successful "spoiling operations"---
attacks in force into areas where the 
enemy has been trying to concentrate 
forces for large-scale actions. 
1. These operations have not only 
kept the Communists off balance, 
but have inflicted heavy casualties. 
2. One good example was Operation 
Hastings, carried out in July in 
northern Quang Tri Province. U. S. 
Marines and South Vietnamese regulars 
attacked units of the 324-B Divisinn 
of the North Vietnamese army, which 
had infiltrated directly across the 
Demilitarized Zone.

3. In an operation continuing from July 
7 to August 2, the allied forces 
killed 882 men--by actual body count--
and many more were probably killed by 
tactical air strikes. The North 
Vietnamese units were forced back into 
the demilitarized zone. 
B. This action, of course, did not destroy the 
North Vietnamese division, which has possibly 
7,000 men. As a matter of fact, our latest 
intelligence indicates that the 324-B division, 
together with other North Vietnamese units, 
is again concentrating in and immediately 
south of the Demilitarized Zone for another 
attempt to launch operations. 
1. Operation Hastings, however, demonstrates 
how the allied tactics have been able to 
disrupt the Communist timetable. 
2. These spoiling operations have been 
successful largely because the allied 
forces have such great mobility, and 
because of the constant improvement in 
the intelligence on enemy dispositions 
and moves. 
C. Since late July, there have been no engagements 
as extensive as Hastings.

1. The allied forces, however, have been 
maintaining the pressure with 10 to 15 
operations a day in battalion strength 
or greater. 
2. These probing operations have led to 
a number of small but sharp engagements 
which have cost the Communists an average 
of about'1,550 men killed per week. 
D. In most of the encounters this spring and 
summer, the enemy has not chosen to stand 
and fight, as he did in the 1a Drang Valley 
battle in Pleiku Province last November. 
The Communists have been taking heavy casualties---
the body count for the first eight months this year 
already exceeds the 35,400 killed in 1965. 
A. The rate of infiltration from North Vietnam, 
however, is also greatly increased. Apparently 
the Viet Cong are also calling up a larger 
number of their regional guerrillas for the 
main forces. 
1. The Communist main force now has more 
than 106,000 men in combat units-158 
battalions. 
2. This includes about 50,000 men in regular 
formations of the North Vietnamese army.

3. We believe that there are 19 North 
Vietnamese and 13 Viet Cong regiments. 
B. Many of the 158 enemy battalions operate as 
independent battalions, or in even smaller 
units. There are, however, at least 
which are 
capable of pulling battalions and regiments 
together for concerted Communist attacks on 
a major scale. 
C. This means that the enemy retains a signi-
ficant capability for large-scale operations, 
as well as a high level of small actions 
against isolated outposts and smaller allied 
units. 
D. There is no indication that there has been 
any radical change in the overall Communist 
strategy. That is to attack in force wherever 
the terrain and other factors are strongly to 
their advantage, and where they believe they 
can achieve victories at the smallest pessible 
cost. 
(SOUTH VIETNAMESE POLITICAL SITUATION) 
I. As for the political situation in South Vietnam, 
the miliary government of Premier Ky continues 
to maintain the relatively stable position it has 
enjoyed since overcoming the Buddhist "struggle"

Approved ForliItlease 201)0110,i/11/7 liCIA-RDP79*0827A000400080004-2 
movement last spring. 
A. Most recently, of course, the election held 
last Sunday has been the center of attention. 
The outcome appears likely to enhance the 
stability of the regime. 
B. The identities of those elected to tY 
constituent assembly have no particular 
bearing; the significant facts are that 
more than five and a quarter million people 
registered to vote, and that more than 
80 percent of those registered actually 
cast their ballots. 
C. This would appear to be an excellent 
performance in the light of a call by the 
more militant of the Buddhist leaders for 
a boycott, and threats by the Viet Cong 
against candidates and voters. 
1. Incidents of terrorism and harassment 
by the Viet Cong were five times as 
high on Election Day as on a normal 
day. In general, however, the voting 
took place without serious incidents. 
2. There may have been some padding of the 
rural vote, but observers throughout 
the country found no evidence of 
official coercion, fraud, or other rigging.

Approved Foie lease 2b0b/64/I17': IA-RDP70T60827A000400080004-2 
D. The government, of course, made an 
all-out security effort to prevent Viet 
Cong disruption of the election, but the 
voter turn-out at least indicates that 
in areas where there is a government 
presence there is less fear of the Viet 
Cong, and probably less sympathy for their 
cause. 
E. As for the failure of the Buddhist appeal 
for the faithful to abstain from voting, 
it points up the weakness in secular 
matters of the militants around Thich Tri 
Quang who at present control the policies 
of the Buddhist Institute. 
II. There are some internal strains within the 
military government which might ultimately 
cause trouble as the time approaches for the 
installation of an elected government under the 
new constitution now to be drafted. 
A. These strains, however, in large part do 
not reflect a refusal by the military to 
go along with the constitutional process. 
1. They reflect instead the rivalry of 
some senior military commanders with 
Premier Ky, and their fear that Ky 
might dismiss them.

Approved ForSelease 2000/04/17 : CIA-RDP79*0827A000400080004-2 
2. There have also been indications of 
some complaints by some junior officers 
objecting to alleged corruption of their 
superiors. 
3. None of these strains, however, appear 
so serious or so widespread as to 
threaten Ky's position at this time. 
(NORTH VIETNAM)  
I. As for North Vietnam, the Hanoi leaders appear as 
determined as ever to continue the war. They have 
rejected all attempts by third parties to get 
negotiations started. 
The level of air strikes against North Vietnam has 
expanded considerably during the past several 
months. 
A. The major targets are North Vietnamese lines 
of communication, and their POL facilities. 
B. 
The North Vietnamese continue, however, 
be able to move enough men and supplies 
through Laos into South Vietnam to maintain 
the operations of the Communists in the South. 
We have obtained more and more evidence in recent 
months of the extent to which Hanoi is running--
and taking part in--the war in South Vietnam. 
A. Captured documents and the interrogation of 
prisoners have now identified the man who

to 
Approved Foraelease 2b0r0/64P17E: 61A-RDP79f40827A000400080004-2 
is running the entire Communist war effort 
in South Vietnam. He is Nguyen Chi Thanh, 
( *NNGWEEN CHEF, TAHN ) a politburo member 
of the North Vietnamese Communist Party. 
1. Thanh is a general i71-7171?N-Rth Vittna-
mese Army, and has been its political 
commissar. He left North Vietnam to 
take over operations in the South early 
in 1965. 
2. His two principal deputies are also 
both generals in the North Vietnamese 
Army, and members of the central 
corn-
mittee of the North Vietnamese Commu-
nist Party. 
3. One of them, the military deputy, is 
Tran Van Tra, who used to be deputy 
chief of staff of the North Vietnamese 
Army. Now, under the alias of Tran Nam Trung, 
he is listed as chief of the military 
affairs committee of the so-called 
National Front for the Liberation of 
South Vietnam. 
4. The deputy who runs the Communist political 
organization in South Vietnam is General 
Tran Do. 
B. That is a good sample of how little identification

DCI BRIEFING FOR 
SOVIET POLICIES IN ASIA 
T. Moscow's new leaders have significantly improved 
Soviet fortunes in Asia. 
A. Moscow has modified its tactics in the Sino-
Soviet dispute and reasserted itself in Viet-
nam, in order to regain ground lost to China 
during the Khrushchev years. 
B. The Brezhnev - Kosygin regime has replaced 
Khrushchev's collision course with China, 
adopting a more subtle, non-polemical, and 
reasonable style. This has provided a strik-
ing contrast to China's increasingly belliger-
ent and dogmatic approach. 
C. Moscow's new tactic has been vindicated, most 
recently by what you might call the North 
Korean "declaration of independence," and by 
the growing strains between the Japanese Com-
munists and Peking.

Premier Kosygin's trip to Hanoi in February of 
1965 was the first step in Moscow's attempt to 
reclaim its past influence in North Vietnam. 
A. Since then, the Soviets have worked to en-
hance their "revolutionary" image and to re-
build their presence in Vietnam by giving 
Hanoi sizable quantities of economic aid and 
by bolstering Hanoi's defensive capabilities. 
B. Th p USSR, while working for a larger role in 
sh4ping events in Vietnam, has at the same 
time displayed relative caution and restraint. 
In particular, it has taken care not to risk 
a direct confrontation with the US. 
III. The Soviet leadership will undoubtedly favor a 
negotiated settlement, if and when Hanoi does. 
A. As long as the North Vietnamese continue to 
demonstrate their opposition to peace talks, 
however, Moscow is unwilling to take any 
initiatives itself--for example, in its ca-
pacity as a co-chairman of the Geneva Con-
ference. 
B. The USSR is going to be very careful that 
the influence it has just acquired in Hanoi 
is not again lost to the Chinese. As a result,

Approved For Ra1ea00/011/1/JEACMI:E79T410827A000400080004-2 
the Soviets will seek negotiations only when 
they are explicitly asked by Hanoi to make 
such a move. 
IV. The Soviets are winning points in the Communist 
world by capitalizing on China's intransigence 
and increasing dogmatism. Moscow is also work-
ing in the non-Communist world to secure greater 
influence at Chinese expense. 
A. Moscow has demonstrated its intent to provide 
an effective counterweight to China in Asia, 
particularly during the past year. 
1. Soviet "good offices" at Tashkent last 
January revealed real Russian apprehen-
sion that further discord in South Asia 
would be exploited by Peking. 
2. The Soviets recently also expressed a 
readiness to renew aid to the volatile 
Prince Sihanouk in Cambodia, in an ef-
fort to offset Chinese inroads in Phnom 
Penh. 
B. The dramatic setback to Chinese prestige in 
Indonesia could also turn out to be a plus 
for Moscow, even though the posture of the 
new leadership in Djakarta has been against 
Communism no matter what its origin.

1. The Soviet leaders may be concerned that 
the Indonesian military leaders are turn-
ing too far toward the West. They are 
probably pleased, however, that Indonesia's 
pro-Peking drift has been halted, and that 
the pro-Chinese voice of the big Indonesian 
Communist Party has been silenced. 
2. The Kremlin probably hopes that it has 
enough leverage to keep Indonesia relatively 
neutral through the sizable Soviet invest-
ment in the Indonesian military. This ac-
counts for more than one billion dollars 
of the Indonesian foreign debt. 
3. Privately the Soviets were probably also 
pleased with the end of the Malaysian 
"confrontation." This frees Moscow to 
establish its own presence in Malaysia 
and Singapore. Recent trade talks in 
Singapore bear this out. 
V. The Soviet interest in establishing strong in-
fluence in Hanoi has to a certain extent limited 
similar efforts in a number of countries, par-
ticularly Laos.

A. This was revealed most recently during the 
trip to the USSR of the Laotian King and the 
neutralist Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma. 
1. Moscow initially displayed interest in 
good relations with Vientiane. However, 
the Prime Minister's very cool reception 
in Moscow made it apparent that the So-
viets were unwilling to risk alienating 
Hanoi. 
2. The North Vietnamese, speaking through 
Pathet Lao propaganda outlets, had become 
increasingly abusive of the neutralist 
leader and his government. 
3. Moscow has frequently protested support 
given the US effort in Vietnam by both 
Laos and Thailand. 
B. Vietnam will continue to be the fulcrum of 
Soviet policies in Southeast Asia.
