also first and foremost the principal adviser on for-
eign intelligence to the President and the National Se-
curity Council. And he is also chairman of the United 
States Intelligence Board or USIB, which brings together 
the entire intelligence community. 
Q What do you mean by that? 
A The intelligence community is made up of all the 
elements in our government which have an intelligence 
function--not just CIA, but the intelligence components 
of the Departments of State and Defense, of the individual 
armed services, of the Atomic Energy Commission, and of 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The National Secu-
rity Council has ordered the Director of Central Intelli-
gence to coordinate the work of all these components. The 
National Security Act established the Central Intelligence 
Agency to correlate, evaluate, produce, and disseminate 
within the government all intelligence bearing on the na-
tional security. 
Q What is the specific charter of the CIA within the 
intelligence community? 
A The National Security Act assigned five functions 
to the Agency: 
To advise the NSC--and of course the President--
on intelligence matters relating to national security; 
to coordinate all foreign intelligence activities 
of our government; 
Approved For Release 2000/08/1 : CIA-RDP79T00827A000300060004-5 
Approved A:p rpim,!w 3p9omigAiiigAtRinpnouNtquacto060004-5 
intelligence within the government; 
to undertake what we call "services of common 
concern"--that is, functions which serve all the compo-
nents of the intelligence community and can best be un 
dertaken centrally; 
and finally, to perform such other services as 
the National Security Council may direct. That is as 
specific as the Congress wanted to be, but of course 
that fifth assignment is our charter for clandestine ac-
tivities, and you will notice that it puts them directly 
under the control of the NSC, and thereby the President. 
Q The emphasis appears to be on information-
gathering. Wouldn't it be more palatable and just as ac-
curate to call it the "Central Information Agency?" 
A Our principal responsibility is to gather, spe-
cifically, that information which relates directly to na-
tional security problems and objectives. The United 
States Information Agency deals with information in the 
broader sense of the term, and distributes it outside the 
government. It is useful both to their operations and to 
ours to preserve this distinction. There is a further 
point in our professional terminology: "intelligence," 
as we use the term, refers to information which has been 
carefully evaluated as to its accuracy and significance. 
The difference between "information" and "intelligence" 
is the important process of evaluating the accuracy, and 
assessing the significance in terms of national security.

Apprc:rdfcRf INEtqlosiV9PPR8q? :ii9A-ARMTPPNVAPVIRDA6X04-5 
gence." What is that in your terminology? 
A When a raw report has been checked out against A 
all other available information on the same subject,m0 
analyzed and evaluated by competent experts in that par-
ticular field, we call it "finished intelligence." When, 
in addition, it represents the agreed conclusions of the 
entire intelligence community, then it is "national in-
telligence." In short, we find that we need a terminology 
which can be more precise and more limiting than the 
broad concept of "information." 
Q People seem to have the impression that the CIA 
is a big "spying" organization--that it is staffed almost 
entirely by spies. Is there anything to that impression? 
A This, of course, is the popular view of any in-
telligence organization, but it is highly distorted. Our 
job is to keep the top officials of the U. S. Government 
informed of what is happening around the world that may 
affect the national security of the United States. Of 
course, much of the world's area and population is under 
a closed society, run by governments that seek to conceal 
their activities and their objectives. They may be hos-
tile to us, and some classical espionage is required to 
give timely warning of when and how these activities and 
objectives might threaten us. But to maintain proper 
perspective, let me point out that a great deal of the 
raw information is public, or available with a certain 
amount of digging. The principal role of an intelligence

organization is tt take what is overt and -twat is secret, 
and bring expert knowledge, background information, and 
scholarly analysis to bear in a way which has nothing in 
common with the heroes of modern spy fiction. 
Q Could you give us the proportions between the 
analysts at home and the men in the field overseas who 
are collecting this information? 
A We don't publish these figures, or even rough 
proportions, because the information would be of great 
use to the opposition, but I can tell you this much: the 
man who joinis CIA has far less chance, in the course of 
his career, of identifying with James Bond or "The Spy 
Who Came In From The Cold," than he does of serving as an 
academic researcher, economist, scientist, statistician, 
administrator, accountant, or supply officer. 
Q Another idea is that the CIA is in the business 
of stirring up insurrections, or starting and maybe run-
ning little wars. 
A This again is a misconception. Our major business 
is national intelligence, and so-called covert opera-
tions are a relatively minor part of our over-all activ-
ities against Communism. Furthermore, a glance at to-
day's headlines should make it obvious that the leaders 
of our government expect us to forestall or help combat 
insurrections, not stir them up. The government, after 
all, is organized on a pretty logical basis: the Depart-
ment of State is in charge of foreign policy and foreign

relations; running wars would be the business of the 
Defense Department; CIA has enough to do getting, coor-
dinating, and disseminating intelligence without running 
any wars. 
Q The National Security Act clearly envisages a 
field of clandestine activities, however, where the CIA 
will play a role which cannot be undertaken by State, or 
Defense, or other overt agencies of the United States 
Government. Do you have a free hand here? 
A Absolutely not. Any such activities are by di-
rection of the National Security Council. To be precise, 
44100-
they must have the prior approval--in detail--of a com-
mittee of the NSC on which top-ranking representatives of 
the President, the Secretary of State, and the Secretary 
of Defense meet with the Director of Central Intelligence 
for this purpose. These gentlemen see to it, not only 
that every activity of the CIA is completely in consonance 
with the established policies and objectives of the 
United States, but that it is also advantageous to the 
United States. 
Q With that approval, are you free to operate as you 
wish in the field? Would the U. S. Ambassador in the 
country concerned know about your activities there?

Q Does the Ambassador receive your intelligence in 
the field, or does he have to get it from Washington? 
Q You and your predecessors have stated, as have 
the President and Secretary Rusk, that CIA does not make 
policy, but the accusation persists. Could this be be-
cause your information contributes to policy decisions?

that CIA has never made policy, and has never operated

outside or contrary to established policy. Now, cer-
tainly nobody would expect the top officials of a gov-
ernment to make their decisions without considering all 
available information. It is the mission of CIA to 
provide the most accurate, ?the most comprehensive, and 
the most objective information available about matters 
which interest our Government, together with whatever 
we can learn or project about possible impending devel-
opments. In specific answer to your question, put the 
emphasis on "objective" information. 
Q But this information does play a part in the de-
cisions of government? 
A The top officials of the Administration, and for 
that matter, the legislators, obviously find it useful, 
because there is a constant increase in the demand for 
our current intelligence and OUT projective estimates. 
Let me point out that there is one unique contribution 
the CIA makes to government officials facing a choice 
between alternative possible courses of action. Pre-
cisely because the CIA does not commit itself to any one 
choice among the alternatives, our intelligence input 
is free from partisanship or advocacy, and recognized by 
the recipients as objective.

Q Is there any other Administration control of 
your operations besides the special NSC committee you 
mentioned? 
A The CIA and its activities have been reviewed 
in detail in the past by Hoover Commission task forces, 
the Doolittle Committee, the Clark Committee, and 
several special investigating bodies for specific pur-
poses. On a permanent basis, the entire intelligence 
community is under continuing and full scrutiny by a 
most knowledgeable and distinguished board of private 
citizens appointed by the President. This is the 
President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, first 
established in January of 1956 as the Killian Com-
mittee, and now under the chairmanship of Mr. Clark 
Clifford. The present membership includes Dr. William 
0. Baker of Bell Telephone Laboratories; Mr. Gordon 
Gray, former Special Assistant to President Eisenhower 
and one-time President of North Carolina University; 
Professor William Langer of Harvard; General Maxwell 
Taylor; Ambassador Robert Murphy, former Under Secre-
tary of State; Mr. Frank Pace, Jr., former Secretary 
of the Army and Former Director of the Bureau of the 
Budget; Dr. Edwin Land, head of the Polaroid Corpora-
tion; Admiral John Sides, USN (ret.); and Mr. Augustus 
Long, formerly the top executive of the Texas Company.

This Board meets in full session about every six 
weeks to examine in detail the work, the progress, 
and the shortcomings of the entire U.S. intelligence 
program. The meetings last two or three days and 
include comprehensive discussions with the Director 
and his senior officers, heads of other intelligence 
components, and senior officials of the Government 
who are our "customers." Upon completion of each 
such session, the Board reports to the President and 
makes recommendations for the improvement of the in-
telligence effort. In addition, the Board has a 
number of two-man or three-man panels and subcom-
mittees to delve more deeply and on a full-time basis 
into specific aspects and categories of intelligence 
work. 
Q What about control of your funds? 
A The Central Intelligence Agency budget is re-
viewed fully by the Bureau of the Budget, which re-
quires the same assurances and justifications for 
expenditures by intelligence agencies that it re-
quires from any other part of our government. We 
are not immune from detailed examination of our re-
quests by the Bureau, nor are we exempt from its 
skillful pruning knife. We have to go to Congress

Approved For Rolease 2000/08/15 : CIA-RDP79T49827A000300060004-5 
for our funds, just like other agencies. The only 
difference is that after our requests have been ap-
proved by certain special Congressional subcommittees, 
the specific appropriations are then lumped in for 
passage with other appropriations, to deny hostile 
intelligence services information about our activ-
ities which would be very useful to them. We have 
meticulous auditing procedures to ensure the tightest 
possible control over the expediture of funds en-
trusted to the CIA. 
Q In light of the recurring arguments about a 
so-called "Watchdog Committee" for CIA, how much in-
formation does Congress actually get--not your in-
telligence reports, that is, but information about 
your activities, your budget, and so on? 
A Ever since CIA was first established, the 
Director has been authorized and in fact directed to 
make complete disclosure of CIA activities to special 
subcommittees in both the Senate and House. In the 
House, the Appropriations Committee and the Armed 
Services Committee each have a special subcommittee 
for this purpose. In the Senate, the corresponding 
committees have subcommittees which usually meet 
jointly. In addition, I report regularly to the 
-11-
Approved For Release 2000/08/15 : CIA-RDP79T00827A000300060004-5 
Approved FoOelease 2000/08/15 : CIA-RDP7W00827A000300060004-5 
Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy on 
intelligence matters in that field. Now, when I 
say "complete disclosure," I mean complete--and fre-
quent. We are completely responsive to their ques-
tions, no matter how sensitive. I have discussed 
matters with these special subcommittees which are 
so sensitive that only a small percentage of the 
personnel in CIA have access to them. And in case 
there is any suggestion that these meetings are 
sporadic and casual: In my first 12 weeks as Di-
rector I found that I was called to 17 meetings with 
these Congressional committees. Our legislative log 
for the year 1965 shows that the Director or his 
senior aides met a total of 34 times with the four 
special subcommittees. 
Q Are they the only Congressmen who receive in-
formation from CIA? Intelligence, that is, as op-
posed to operational matters? 
A No, there were also 19 other committee hear-
ings in 1965, for instance, to obtain substantive 
intelligence from CIA--and some of these hearings ran 
as long as three full days to cover the intelligence 
appreciation of the global situation. We also fre-
quently brief individual members of Congress. Let

Approved Fo,LVelease 2000/08/15: CIA-RDP7SW00827A000300060004-5 
me make this distinction clear: I had authority to 
brief any Congressional committee having a juris-
dictional interest on substantive global intelli-
gence. But discussion of CIA activities, methods, 
and sources is another matter. Public Law 80-253 of 
1947--that's the National Security Act--makes the 
Director of Central Intelligence exclusively re-
sponsible for protecting the security of the sources 
and methods of the entire intelligence community. I 
was authorized by the President and by National Se-
curity Council directives to discuss such matters only 
with the special subcommittees designated for this 
purpose, not with any others. 
Q What is the reason for this limitation? 
A It is not arbitrary or bureaucratic--we are 
safeguarding the lives of trusted agents and our OWD 
staff people all over the world who contribute to our 
Government's intelligence objectives. We owe it to 
them to take every precaution to protect them--and we 
owe it to our Government to give hostile intelligence 
services no indirect hints or clues which might en-
able the opposition to take steps to blunt our in-
telligence operations, methods, and sources.

Q You mean it is a question of security leaks? 
A I prefer to say inadvertent disclosure. Even 
a professional intelligence officer has to be alert 
to draw the line between information which helps ?to 
evaluate or authenticate a piece of raw intelligence, 
and information which might point to the source or 
the method we used to obtain it. The more people who 
have both types of 'information, the more you multiply 
the chance that somebody will overstep that line by 
accident. 
Q How damaging can such disclosures be? 
A Well, the minute you even hint that you have 
information the other fellow has been trying to keep 
secret, it is one of the first principles of the art 
that he will do everything possible to locate and de-
stroy your source, or disrupt your method of opera-
tion. If the opposition is given any clues to help 
pinpoint the source, the counter-intelligence job 
is that much easier. 
Q Have the special CIA subcommittees in Con-
gress expressed any dissatisfaction over the years 
that they were not getting enough information? 
A We have never withheld any information, 
substantive or operational, from: the four special 
-14-
Approved For Release 2000/08/15 : CIA-RDP79T00827A000300060004-5 
Approved For Relea4p 2000/08/15 : CIA-RDP79T008171A000300060004-5 
subcommittees. On some occasions, in fact, they have 
asked us not to give them the identities of very 
sensitive sources, because they did not wish to know, 
and we have complied. If you refer to dissatisfac-
tion with the amount of information which we have--
rather than the amount we give them--no professional 
intelligence operation anywhere in the world is ever 
satisfied with the extent of its knowledge, and these 
gentlemen have been working with us long enough so 
that they have probably acquired this same profes-
sional dissatisfaction. 
Q Isn't it true that much of the information 
you gather isn't really secret at all, but would be 
available to anybody in the right spot at the right 
time? 
A Yes. In fact, a considerable part of the in-
formation used by the Agency in preparing its finished 
intelligence reports is derived from the foreign 
press and radio, from technical journals of foreign 
countries, and from official publications of these 
countries. We don't disregard information simply 
because it is not secret. Finished intelligence, how-
ever, consists of the expert correlation and interpre-
tation of all the information we can obtain, by both 
overt and clandestine means.

Q Do you gather information about the domestic 
events in foreign countries, as well as the opera-
tions of foreign governments? 
A Our interests and responsibilities may vary 
from country to country, but they are pretty compre-
hensive. It is obviously impossible to confine your-
self to a nation's foreign affairs if you are re-
sponsible, for instance, for assessing the stability 
of the regime, the health of the economy, or the 
prospects for subversion in the boondocks. 
Q Do you collect information of a business 
nature? 
A We collect economic information which may be 
useful to the security interests of the U. S. Gov-
ernment--and we collect it exclusively for that pur-
pose. 
Q Do you have to cover every corner of the 
whole world? 
A Of course we have priorities, but our intel-
ligence requirements are worldwide. Our top Admin-
istration officials need factual and unbiased intel-
ligence on a timely basis as one of the many elements 
which go into the decisions they have to make. At a 
minimum, we have to have certain basic information on

hand about virtually every country in the world. 
Country X -- you name it -- might appear remote and 
totally unrelated to our national security, but it 
is nevertheless impossible to state with certainty 
thatA detailed information. about Country X will not 
become necessary to our government on a crash basis 
some day. 
Q How detailed? 
A Well, I can tell you that while we have not 
yet finished our complete program, this basic infor-
mation on foreign countries--Auch of which) of course, 
is hardly secret-already adds up to more than 10 
times the size of the Encyclopedia Britannica. It 
has to cover such prosaic matters as economic sta-
tistics, legal codes, sociological conditions, and 
transport facilities, but it comes in handy when our 
customers start playing Twenty Questions. 
Q At what point do you feel that this type of 
information--the basic data, the information which 
is open to the public--should be reported back on a 
running basis to our government--as fast as you get 
it? 
A This goes back to the distinction between 
information and intelligence--and the needs of our

government. If everything is quiet, there may be an 
occasional situation, report based largely on open. in-
formation. If the situation has a direct relation to 
US national security interests, particularly in a 
crisis, we will be trying to get as close to "real 
time" reporting as modern communications permit. 
Q Is the information, which you collect inter-
preted by somebody on the scene, or does it reach you 
in raw form so that you can sort out the facts from 
the opinions? 
A We require the original report, or the 
original statement of the primary source, whenever 
we can get it. When this "raw material" reaches us, 
it may be accompanied by the opinions and interpreta-
tions of intermediaries through whom the information 
has passed, and by the informed comment and pre-
liminary evaluation of our own collectors in the field, 
but these additions are clearly labeled as such.

Q How do you cooperate in the field with the other 
elements of your intelligence community? Aren't CIA and 
State and the military intelligence people all looking for 
much of the same information? 
A Our finished national intelligence derives from 
the work of all of the elements of the intelligence com-
munity. Foreign service officers provide the Department 
of State with political intelligence, commercial attaches 
are responsible for economic information, the military 
attaches send military intelligence to their respective 
services, and for that matter there are agricultural 
attaches and labor attaches. All of them provide depart-
mental intelligence for the specific needs of specific 
departments. 1, The CIA has been added to supplement and

'Approved Focrgelease 2000/08/15: CIA-RDP79.1000827A000300060004-5 
in Washington to make the whole, and furthermore that the 
finished evaluation reaches the department which needs it. 
Q But how do you avoid duplication of effort in 
the field? 
A The United States Intelligence Board, which 
represents the entire intelligence community, establishes 
t r 
intelligence requirements and(assignglpriorities for the 
collection effort. This machinery can control unnecessary 
duplication, but when you are after the closely guarded 
secrets of a closed society like Russia or China, duplication 
of effort is often desirable, rather than unnecessary. 
Q Are the State and military intelligence people 
operating under handicaps, in comparison to CIA, in 
obtaining information? 
A You have to take into consideration, firstly, that 
the collection, of intelligence is not the primary responsi-
bility of the Department of State and the Department of 
Defense, and secondly, that the representatives they send 
aborad must operate in the open as recognized officials of 
the U.S. Governitent. In effect, we are in a better position 
to obtain the intelligence we-need, because CIA is specifi-
cally organized for the clandestine collection of intelli-
gence, and can give it first priority. 
If, by handicaps, you mefi the obstacles which 
fr 
foreign governments place in the way of intelligence

collection, foreign governments make every effort to preserve 
their essential secrets, just as we do. Year by year security 
procedures become more sophisticated and harder to circumvent, 
so that skill and specialization are even more necessary. 
On the other side of the coin, there are few if any countries 
in the world today which are as much of an "open society" 
as the United States. 
Q What about cooperation with the intelligence 
services of friendly countries? If we collect information 
which is important to one of our allies, is it passed to 
them? 
A I am not at liberty to go into detail, but wherever 
it is of mutual interest and advantage, there is substantial 
cooperation among the intelligence services of friendly 
countries. 
Q Does machinery exist to correlate all of the 
information that flows into Washington, and refine it into 
firm and useful conclusions? 
A Yes--specifically, the United States Intelligence 
Board, or USIB, which is advisory to the Director of Central 
Intelligence and under his chOrmanship. This Board meets 
every week, or more often if necessary, to coordinate the 
work 
,revteT,;th-,e- gins of all of the intelligence 
components of the U. S. Government.-, ,It onsists of: The 
Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, who represents CIA

Approved Ralf Release 2000/08/15 : CIA-RDRieT00827A000300060004-5 
so that the Director, as USIB Chairman, will be uncommitted; 
the Director of Intelligence and Research, Department of 
State; the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency; the 
Director of the National Security Agency; an Assistant 
Director of the FBI; and the Assistant General Manager for 
Administration of the Atomic Energy Commission. The heads 
of Army, Navy, and Air Force intelligence meet with the 
Board as observers. USIB assigns intelligence priorities 
to see to it that there are no gaps in our coverage, and 
ensures that the judgments which go forward to the President 
are finished, national intelligence. 
This job of correlation and coordipation, however, 
starts long before the product reaches USIB for final review. 
More and more, as we develop and refine the concept of an 
intelligence community, the analysts and the specialists in 
one component are in constant touch and interchange with 
their opposite numbers in the other departments and agencies, 
so that the national intelligence process begins as soon as 
the raw information reaches Washington, if not before. 
As for moving from the raw information to a firm 
and agreed conclusion, in many instances this can be done 
by the expert analysts available, backed up by our store-
house of background knowledge. There will always, of course, 
be the "unknowables"--questions which have no definitive 
answers, possibly because the future is open to the effects 
-22-

Approved For Release 2000/08/15 : CIA-RDW9T00827A000300060004-5 
of many variables, or because the future depends on decisions 
which certain foreign statesmen may not even have made yet. 
Who wilL succeed Mao Tse-tung? When, and by whom, will there 
be a successful coup in Country X? Our government leaders 
need and request our best answers on the "unknowables." 
This we do in our National Intelligence Estimates. From 
what we do know, the best thinking available in the entire 
intelligence community makes rational inferences about the 
unknown--with varying degrees of confidence, and an occasional 
footnote reflecting an individual dissent from the agreed 
opinion. 
Q How many of these estimates do you produce? 
A It varies with the need. The Estimate is not a 
global periodical, on a weekly or daily basis; it addresses 
itself to the probable course of one development, or one 
country. Many of the Estimates come out with a scheduled 
frequency--annually, for instance, if necessary. Some are 
produced in times of crisis in a matter of hours. All 
are geared to the intelligence needs of the top government 
officials. All reflect the greatest possible professional 
skill and dispassionate objectivity we can bring to bear. 
AWgrind low, Waxes, and iii4k do not permit oursel:tres to become 
advocates of specific policies in preparing our Estimates. 
All aspects of every Estimate get the fullest 
consideration, by the inter-agency working groups which

Approved For lease 2000/08/15 : CIA-RDP79W0827A000300060004-5 
begin the drafting, by the Board of National Estimates--
a group of distinguished senior officers of long experience 
and proven competence in diverse fields of government--and 
by the United States Intelligence Board. In the end, the 
National Intelligence Estimate is the report of the 
Director of Central Intelligence to the President and the 
National Security Council. 
Q Can this machinery operate fast enough to permit 
quick action when the flow of information suggests impend-
ing danger or trouble? 
A The process is extremely flexible. Conceivably, 
when the schedule permits, the draft of an annual Estimate 
might start two or three months before the target date, 
to permit comprehensive and deliberate consultation, ref-
erence to the field, and so forth. On the other hand, 
the Board of National Estimates when required can complete 
what we call a "SNIE"--a Special National Intelligence 
Estimate--in a matter of hours, as I said. As for immediate 
intelligence on current developments, we are geared to re-
ceive information, evaluate it, produce intelligence and 
react 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Nobody in the 
Agency, from the analysts to the Director, is guaranteed 
a night's uninterrupted sleep, or an unbroken weekend. 
Q As we understand it, the Central Intelligence 
Agency does not run clandestine operations of any kind 
within the United States. Is that left entirely to the FBI?

Approved For %/lease 2000/08/15 : CIA-RDP79T40827A000300060004-5 
A The CIA has the responsibility for conducting 
operations outside the country; the FBI has as its principal 
mission the internal security of the United States and its 
possessions. There is, of course, close cooperation and 
considerable interplay between our organizations, because 
we are combatting an international conspiracy whose opera-
tions and agents move back and forth between this country 
and foreign nations. The FBI and CIA therefore work very 
closely together and keep each other intimately informed 
on items of potential interest or concern to each other. 
This allows us to combat international conspiracy in the 
most effective possible manner. The division of responsi-
bility for clandestine operations, of course, should not 
be confused with the perfectly overt contacts we have, 
domestically, for example, with experts in the academic 
world to discuss international situations and exchange 
analyses. 
Q Do you work largely in a vacuum, with little or 
no contact with the rest of the government outside the 
intelligence community? 
A By no means. It is inherent in the concept of 
a Central Intelligence Agency that any branch of the gov-
ernment which has a legitimate need for information can 
call on us for it. By the same token, when we need 
expertise to help us in evaluation, or in the accomplish-
ment of any of our missions, we will not hesitate to go

apywhere in the government or outside it, within the 
limitations of security, where we might expect to find the 
necessary help. But our closest ties, of course, are 
within the intelligence community', and to the top officials 
of the Executive Branch. 
Q What form do your intelligence reports take? 
A We disseminate finished intelligence in an 
infinite variety of formats, tailored to specific purposes, 
I reported frequently in person, of course, to the President 
and to the National Security Council. I have mentioned 
the Estimates, and our "55-foot shelf" of basic background 
information. In addition, we have daily, weekly, and 
monthly publications, some global in scope, some for a 
specific country or crisis When the situation is truly 
critical, I have on occasion ordered situation reports as 
P 
often as every hour on the hour, around the clock. T4en 
there are individual memoranda which give us great flexi-
bility in scope, format , deadlines, and distribution. And 
we also turn out studies in depth which are the equivalent 
of a scholarly book or a doctoral dissertation. Various 
publications have dissemination lists, depending on their 
sensitivity and purpose, which range from less than half a 
kitiv-SALtiP 
dozen copies tolaian?tha-n-040. 
Q What is the "ancestry" of the CIA in U. S. intel-
ligence activities? Does it operate differently from its 
predecessors?

Approved For Ralease 2000/08/15 : CIA-RDP79140827A000300060004-5 
A The Agency grew from the need to establish a 
centralized and objective intelligence organization in 
peacetime. A primary impetus, of course, was the experi-
ence of Pearl Harbor, and the determination to ensure 
against such surprises in the future. The requirement 
for a centralized organization stemmed from the success-
ful experience during World War II of the Office of 
Strategic Services under General Donovan. The requirement 
was made all the more real by the threat posed by the USSR 
and international Communism which became readily apparent 
shortly after the close of World War II. There was gen-
eral agreement within the Government that there was need 
for a nonpartisan coordinating agency in the intelligence 
field. As a result, the CIA was created in. 1947. In some 
respects the Office of Strategic Services of World War II 
was our ancestor, but it did not have CIA's responsi-
bility for coordinating the work of the entire intelli-
gence community, or our requirement for across-the-board 
coverage. 
Q Does CIA have Eknything that might be called 
regulations to govern its activities? Who prescribes them? 
A Is there a government agency nearly 20 years old 
that doesn't have a rule book? Start with the original 
legislation, which sp'ells out the mission of CIA and 
provides that we function at the behest and under the

Approved For liVease 2000/08/15 : CIA-RDP791.Qp827A000300060004-5 
control of the President and the NSC. Under that charter, 
CIA is governed by several layers of regulations known as 
the "Nonskids," or National Security Council Intelligence 
Directives; the DCID's, or Director of Central Intelligence 
Directives, issued by the Director in his capacity as 
chairman of USIB and head of the intelligence community; 
and finally, as in the case of any other governmental 
component, CIA's own Agency regulations. 
Q Do you have any counsel or advisers outside the 
government? 
A We have several panels of technical experts, 
both inside and outside the government, to keep us informed 
on new developments and technique p which could be of use 
to us. On these panels are the best brains in this country, 
on virtually the entire range of human endeavor. We con-
tract for studies and research projects, wherever in the 
United States these can best be performed. CIA has long 
made it a practice to discuss its evaluations of the 
international situation with top men in the 
We have done a great deal of this, but we must do still 
more. 
Q Have you found that the sporadic criticism, along 
the lines that spying is a devious business and that CIA 
operates without any control, has made people reluctant 
to work with you?

Approved For Railease 2000/08/15 : CIA-RDP791(0827A000300060004-5 
A I have found no measurable reluctance on these 
grounds, although there is always the more general concern 
of the academic world that governmental funds and govern-
mental projects must not be accompanied by unwelcome con-
trols or commitments. On the whole, patriotic citizens in 
all walks of life are glad to work with us in serving the 
national security interest. The intelligence community 
finds thiS very gratifying, because it helps us give the 
President, the Executive Branch, and the Legislative 
Branch the very best judgments that the best minds in this 
country can arrive at. 
Q What about the effect of the criticism on your 
own personnel? 
A I think it is an eloquent testimonial to the 
dedication of the people in CIA that the criticism has 
not affected their morale. Bear in mind that by our 
rules, they cannot answer, deny, or refute the adverse 
comment, even when it is patently and sometimes viciously 
false. Add to that the grave responsibilities for the 
nation's security, the pressure, the anonymity of achieve-
ment, and the constant need for security alertness--it 
is a source of pride, and nothing short of amazement, 
that we keep our people, and keep getting more good ones. 
I asked recently for some statistics on how long our per-
sonnel had been with us. The answers showed that more than 
-29-

Approved For lease 2000/08/15 : CIA-RDP79110827A000300060004-5 
a quarter of our professional personnel--as differentiated 
from the clerical--had been with CIA more than 15 years, and 
that an astounding 77 percent had ten years or more of in-
telligence experience. About 15 percent have graduate 
degrees; five percent have the doctorate. When you con-
sider only the analysts who have the direct responsibility 
in Headquarters for analysis of a foreign area, six out 
of ten of them had lived, worked or traveled abroad even 
before they came to CIA. When you combine all the years 
required for graduate study, foreign experience, and then 
10 to 15 years of intelligence work, it adds up to an 
impressive depth of knowledge, competence, and expertise 
at the service of the nation. I have been careful to stick 
to percentages, but in actual numbers, we could easily and 
adequately staff the faculty of a University with our 
experts. In a way, we do. Many of those who leave us 
join the faculties of universities and colleges; some of 
our personnel take leaves of absence to teach, and renew 
their contacts with the academic world. I suppose this 
is only fair; our energetic recruiting effort not only 
looks for the best young graduate students we can find, but 
r 
also picks eff-a few professors from time to time. 
A What about the criticism that the CIA uses 
"dishonorable" methods? Do you operate on the principle 
that the CIA, as a participant in the Cold War, is justified

in adopting any measures that may be used by opposing 
government--"fighting fire with fire?" 
A We can be rough and unorthodox, we may have to 
be clandestine and devious, but I emphatically reject the 
word "dishonorable." The men and women in CIA are, after 
all, Americans with the same ideals, the same ethics, the 
same moral codes as the rest of the nation. I have with 
me a copy of a remark Secretary Rusk made to a press 
conference last winter, which I would like to read into 
your record if I may: 
 I would emphasize to you that CIA is 
not engaged in .adtivities not known to the 
senior policy officers of the Government. 
But you should also bear in mind that be-
neath the level of public discussion, there 
is a tough struggle going on in the back 
alleys all over the world. It's a tough 
one, it's unpleasant, and no one likes it, 
but that is not a field which can be left 
entirely to the other side. And so once in 
a while some disagreeable things happen, 
and I can tell you that there is a good deal 
of gallantry and a high degree of competence 
in those who have to help us deal with that 
part of the struggle for freedom." 
And President Johnson, when he swore me in as 
Director of Central Intelligence on April 28, 1965, put 
it this way: 
  We have committed our lives, our 
property, our resources and our sacred honor 
to the freedom and peace of other men, indeed 
to the freedom and peace of all mankind. We 
would dishonor that commitment, we would dis-
grace all the sacrifices Americans have made, 
if we were not every hour of every day vigilant 
against every threat to peace and freedom. That 
is why we have the Central Intelligence Agency
