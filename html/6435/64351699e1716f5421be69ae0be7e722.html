European Port 
Access Allegedly 
Restricted / 
Top Secret 
West European naval forces in the Persian Gulf area appear to have 
lost access to Omani and United Arab Emirates' ports on the Gulf of 
The  
UAE, however, will allow use of its ports on the Persian Gulf 
Comment: The source's remarks have not been confirmed. If true, 
the Omani and the UAE decisions probably stem from concern about 
antagonizing Iran by supporting a larger Western naval presence in 
the region. The West European naval forces will find it more difficult to 
sustain their presence in the area without port facilities on the Gulf of 
Oman unless they elect to operate out of ports on the more 
dangerous southern Persian Gulf. The West European navies could 
also seek additional support from Djibouti, but this would limit their 
presence in the Gulf of Oman. The UAE and Oman mi ht reverse their 
decision if Iran resumed mining the Gulf of Oman.

NICARAGUA: Complying With Peace Plan 
Top Secret 
Nicaraguan President Ortega last night outlined steps Managua 
is taking to rear in compliance with the Central American 
peace plan. 
Citing Nicaragua's willingness to comply fully with the peace plan, 
Ortega agreed to begin indirect cease-fire negotiations with 
insurgent leaders through an intermediary. Although no details on 
rebel-government talks were announced, the President stressed they 
would be only for arranging a cease-fire and not a political dialogue. 
Ortega also said the four small cease-fire zones unilaterally declared 
last month would no longer have that status. 
The President will immediately pardon nearly 1,000 political 
prisoners, according to the press. Ortega also indicated he had sent 
decrees to the Sandinista-dominated National Assembly granting 
amnesty to those imprisoned for counterrevolutionary crimes and 
lifting the state of emergency, but both measures would be "frozen" 
until Washinaton stops supporting the anti-Sandinista insurgents. 
Initial domestic reaction has been mixed. According to the press, the 
opposition party representative on the National Reconciliation 
Committee said that the regime's willingness to begin talks with the 
rebels was "extremely important" but that the government had taken 
only a "half step." 
Comment: Ortega's call for cease-fire talks with insurgent leaders is a 
reversal of longstanding regime policy and stands in sharp contrast to 
recent hardline comments by the Sandinista Party principals. The 
Sandinistas probably calculate the move will win international support 
and help undercut criticism from regional political leaders that 
Managua's refusal to negotiate with the rebels has been the chief 
obstacle to peace in the region. The regime probably also hopes that 
agreeing to cease-fire talks, albeit indirectly, may undermine the 
morale of rebel fighters. 
The rebels recently have been calling for Cardinal Obando y Bravo to 
serve as an intermediary, but the final choice is up to the government. 
The Sandinistas, aware of the Cardinal's pro-insurgency sympathies, 
may opt to select a less critical individual. Managua may believe, 
however, that using the National Reconciliation Committee, headed 
by the Cardinal but dominated by the Sandinistas, as an intermediary 
would win more propaganda points.

EASTERN Gorbachev on Bloc Diversity 
EUROPE-USSR: 
Top Secret 
General Secretary Gorbachev's endorsement of Soviet Bloc 
diversity in his speech on foreign policy this week and the call by 
a leading party spokesman on ideology for reexamination of the 
1968 Prague reforms and their aftermath probably will intensify 
factional strife in Czechoslovakia and elsewhere in the region. 
In his speech on Monday, Gorbachev emphasized the equality of all 
Communist states, party responsibility for domestic economic and 
political conditions, and the diversity of forms of voluntary 
cooperation among Bloc countries. In speaking to East European and 
other foreign delegations in Moscow two days later, he endorsed the 
"diversity of experience" of Communist regimes and denounced the 
"arrogance of omniscience"?a seeming reference to Bloc policies 
pursued by previous Soviet leaders. In a press conference that day, 
the head of the Soviet party's ideological think tank, Georgiy Smirnov, 
said it was time to reexamine the events of 1968 in Czechoslovakia, 
including the USSR's intervention. 
Comment: Any Soviet reexamination of history that extends to events 
in Eastern Europe and Moscow's policies toward the region is likely to 
have a far-reaching impact on Moscow's allies. It probably will widen 
splits between reformers and hardliners in the Czechoslovak 
leadership, which bases its legitimacy on its crushing of the 1968 
reforms. The East Germans will worry that a reexamination might 
extend to the 1953 uprising and to the construction of the Berlin Wall 
in 1961. 
Gorbachev's denunciation of Stalin and his policies in Monday's 
speech is probably also unsettling to the Ceausescu regime, whose 
policies in Romania strongly resemble those that Gorbachev rejected. 
All East European leaderships, moreover, are probably worried about 
possible public exposure of the Cold War trials and executions in 
Eastern Europe in the late 1940s and early 1950s. 
Opponents of change in Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary as well 
as the East German and Romanian leaderships will argue that 
Gorbachev's reaffirmation of strong party rule and tolerance of 
diversity allow them to reject glasnost and restructuring. Proponents 
of reform, meanwhile, will interpret Gorbachev's remarks on mutual 
respect and voluntary economic cooperation within the Bloc as a 
green light for economic reforms and closer ties to the West. 
Moscow's statements will increase uncertainty within the region and 
with it the prospect of instability.

SOUTH ASIA: India Manages SAARC Summit Outcome 
India dominated this week's diplomatic deliberations at the 
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation summit just 
as it has intimidated neighboring states in recent months by 
flexing its military and economic muscle. 
Delegates from the seven member countries signed a convention on 
terrorism, established a 200,000-ton food security reserve, and 
formed a consortium of nine national airlines. New Delhi remanded to 
committees the proposals by others on nuclear nonproliferation, 
foreign financing of development projects, and sharing of information 
on drug trafficking, according to diplomatic reporting. 
India encouraged SAARC members to consider Afghanistan's 
application for membership as coming from a contiguous, nonaligned 
nation, even though New Delhi expected Islamabad's objections to 
stall the initiative, according to the US Embassy. 
Prime Minister Gandhi's bilateral discussions were more successful, 
according to diplomatic and press reports. Sri Lankan President 
Jayewardene is to meet with Gandhi in New Delhi today to clarify 
"misunderstandings" about implementing their peace accord. 
New Delhi and Islamabad have announced they will resume bilateral 
talks this winter on nuclear, security, and economic matters. 
Comment: Gandhi has to be pleased with his control over the 
outcome of the summit. He was able to assert India's preeminence, 
while deferring to other members' pride with a show of flexibility on 
the terrorism issue. As the only producer of foodgrain surpluses, India 
could insist on regional self-reliance in all economic areas. Gandhi 
probably tried to privately reassure the other leaders that his 
Sri Lankan intervention and Indian military exercises on the Pakistani 
border last winter do not preclude progress on  bilateral issues, but 
they probably remain skeptical. 
New Delhi's activist policies in the region have won both US and 
Soviet support, except in the case of Afghanistan, where New Delhi's 
interests line up more closely with those of Moscow. The Indians do 
not want a radical Islamic regime in Kabul, and their increased 
diplomatic activity on behalf of Afghanistan may reflect New Delhi's 
assessment that Afghan resistance successes this year, as well as 
General Secretary Gorbachev's apparent interest in a face-saving 
way of reducing Moscow's commitment in Afghanistan, may enhance 
the influence of radical Muslims. New Delhi apparently believes that 
its diplomatic efforts on behalf of Kabul will build up its capital with 
the Soviets without arousing more than limited, short-lived irritation in 
Washington.

WESTERN EUROPE: Outcome of WEU Ministerial 
Foreign and Defense Ministers of the Western European Union 
adopted a "European Security Platform" at their meeting last 
week, and some members are considering a role for the 
revitalized organization in determining and supporting nuclear 
force modernization requirements in the post-INF era. 
In the text of the Security Platform, the seven WEU countries 
supported NATO's strategy of nuclear deterrence and clearly 
endorsed the continued need for US troops in Western Europe. The 
documents recognized the importance of French and British nuclear 
deterrent forces but failed to endorse modernization plans. 
Officials in the British Foreign Office believe the Platform is an 
important step in revitalizing the WEU and have asked the US 
Embassy in London for Washington's views on using the WEU to 
encourage Allied support for nuclear force modernization in the wake 
of an INF agreement. These officials believe talks in the WEU would 
improve prospects for the Belgians and the Dutch to accept 
additional deployments of US dual-capable aircraft as part of NATO's 
compensatory measures. 
Comment: The French and the British would have preferred a clearer 
endorsement of their independent nuclear forces and planned 
modernization programs. However, the nonnuclear Allies, particularly 
the Italians, did not want to exempt indefinitely the French and the 
British nuclear systems from the arms control process. 
WEU members have become more candid in their use of the 
organization to openly develop a European consensus on defense 
issues because most believe that Washington has become more 
supportive of its activities. Adoption of the British proposal to raise 
nuclear modernization in the WEU would mark the first time the WEU 
has addressed specific nuclear deployments?matters normally 
reserved for NATO. London evidently calculates that a "European" 
consensus reached via the WEU would make it easier for smaller 
allies to win public support for nuclear modernization, but the British 
may be overestimating the readiness of the Dutch and the Belgians to 
eventually endorse nuclear weapons modernization. However, French 
participation in such discussions probably would make it more 
difficult for the West Germans to resist a West European position 
favoring nuclear force modernization.

COLOMBIA: New Insurgent Tactics 
Last month's grand alliance of Colombian insurgent groups has 
increased the likelihood of terrorist attacks in Bogota and 
complicated President Barco's efforts to rebuild a truce with the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the largest 
rebel faction. 
Government forces in Bogota and other cities will remain on alert 
through the weekend against terrorist acts commemorating the 
second anniversary of M-19's seizure of the Palace of Justice. 
 have 
reported that M-19 intends to seize a foreign embassy, occupy radio 
stations, hold protest marches, and conduct bombings or 
assassinations in the capital. Other rebel groups reportedly may 
assist in the attacks. 
FARC resumed talks with the government this week for the first time 
since the group's widely condemned ambush of a military unit in June; 
it is trying to maintain an appearance of good faith in prolonging its 
deteriorating three-year-old truce with Bogota. Both sides had made 
minor concessions in order to renew the dialogue. According to the 
press, the government accepted rebel demands to reestablish the 
independent commission to monitor truce compliance that existed in 
the previous administration. FARC has tacitly accepted the 
government's requirement that peace talks must address eventual 
guerrilla disarmament, according to the US Embassy 
Comment: M-19 and FARC joined the other rebel factions last month 
to form the Simon Bolivar Guerrilla Coordinator, an alliance that has 
already carried out several attacks, including a bombing at Ministry of 
Defense Headquarters in Bogota last month. The accord will probably 
revive M-19's declining strength by facilitating its access to funds and 
equipment from other groups. At the same time, cooperation with 
M-19 and other guerrillas has given FARC?the alliance's de facto 
leader?the ability to plan and direct terrorist attacks without openly 
violating the truce. 
FARC's primary short-term objective is consolidation of local political 
power, and its leaders are trying to improve their image and the 
electoral prospects of rebel-backed mayoral candidates next spring. 
They will probably continue to moderate their public stance toward 
negotiations but use the new alliance to increase targeting of 
government officials and facilities in both urban and rural areas. 
Despite several high-casualty ambushes by other rebel factions over 
the past week, the government has chosen to ignore the guerrilla 
alliance to preserve the truce.

Lech Walesa and some 70 dissidents, many of whom are also 
associated with Solidarity, will meet in Warsaw tomorrow, according 
to the US Embassy in Warsaw. A number of independent Catholics 
and intellectuals are expected to participate. The agenda has not 
been disclosed, but the meeting probably will concentrate on a 
response to the regime's referendum on proposed economic and 
political reforms set for 29 November. A similar broadly based 
meeting of dissidents was convened by Solidarity in May just before 
the visit by Pope John Paul II. 
Comment: The wide spectrum of dissidents likely to participate may 
lead Solidarity to change its decision to boycott the referendum, a 
decision that has provoked controversy among the opposition. The 
group may even issue a public statement postponing a final decision 
until a wider range of public opinion, including opposition views, has 
been aired. In the meeting last May, discussion among members with 
widely divergent views produced a moderate statement on reforms 
that seems to have reflected the influence of independent churchmen 
who are willing to discuss reform with the regime. 
POLAND: Another Debt Rescheduling 
Poland and its Western government creditors initialed an agreement 
last week to reschedule $8.5 billion of principal and interest due in the 
period 1986-88?one-fourth of Poland's outstanding debt. Warsaw 
will have to pay only $1 billion in debt service during 1987-88 because 
of its limited earnings and will spread the remaining payments over 
10 years. Some $290 million in overdue payments on its 1981 
rescheduling agreement are to be paid in four monthly installments?
the first due before the new accord can be signed next month. The 
Poles also pressed for new credits and for support in obtaining a 
large IMF loan. 
Comment: The accord, together with the long-term rescheduling 
granted earlier by the banks, gives Warsaw some breathing room in 
dealing with its economic problems. However, the generous terms of 
the agreement?which Western creditors hoped would encourage 
Poles to add to the $140 million already paid this year?probably are 
not enough to preclude further reschedulings that may be needed 
before 1990. Poland may receive new loans from Western creditors 
as a result of the rescheduling but probably faces long negotiations 
on an IMF standby agreement. Still, this easing of the debt burden 
creates the image of continuing momentum for President Jaruzelski's 
reform efforts.

ARGENTINA: Debt Moratorium Threatened 
President Alfonsin has told the US Embassy that Buenos Aires may 
declare a moratorium on its foreign debt as early as today unless the 
IMF grants a waiver on missed performance targets and releases a 
$210 million loan. Buenos Aires believes the IMF reneged on an 
earlier promise to grant a waiver on the basis of the Argentine 
economic austerity package introduced last month. According to 
officials in Buenos Aires, the Fund is refusing to overlook Argentine 
noncompliance unless Buenos Aires raises interest rates, further 
devalues the austral, and establishes a contingency plan in case the 
legislature fails to pass new tax measures. 
Comment: The attempt by Buenos Aires to force the IMF's hand is 
inspired in part by the concessions recently offered to Brazil, which 
has no IMF program and has been far less cooperative with creditors 
than Argentina. Alfonsin probably believes political pressure from his 
own party and from the revitalized Peronist opposition affords him 
little leeway to quicken the pace of economic reform. Because of the 
precarious state of Argentine reserves?possibly less than 
$300 million?and the almost certain loss of more than $1 billion from 
other lenders if the IMF tranche is not disbursed, refusal by the Fund 
to grant a waiver would force Buenos Aires to suspend interest 
payments, at least temporarily. 
CUBA-USSR: Castro Late for Moscow Celebrations 
President Castro's late arrival in Moscow on Wednesday for events 
marking the 70th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution is his most 
recent display of displeasure with Soviet pressure to adopt internal  
reforms.  
 Both 
Castro and Vice President Rodriguez delivered speeches in Moscow 
emphasizing the validity of seeking independent paths within 
"socialism." 
Comment: Castro's failure to attend Gorbachev's speech and the 
remarks by him and Rodriguez underscore Havana's refusal to apply 
the General Secretary's reform program to Cuba.  
 Moscow has so far tried to avoid 
open confrontation with Castro but is probably increasing its pressure 
on Havana in private. Recent questions in Soviet media about Cuba's 
military and economic policies may indicate that Moscow is 
considering stronger measures and might threaten an aid cutback.

CHINA: Party Elders Retain Clout 
The 13th Party Congress last Friday adopted a report critical of the 
work of the Party's Central Advisory Commission?a group of 
semiretired party elders. The report, prepared under the direction of 
Deng Xiaoping, who resigned the Commission's chairmanship on 
Monday, berated the elders' continued meddling in policy and their 
manipulation of former subordinates but offered no concrete 
solutions. It called on seniors to obey the new party leadership and 
lend greater support to current economic reforms. It repeated 
standard characterizations of the Advisory Commission as a 
transitional organization?language first used in 1982. 
Comment: The report indicates the serious problems Deng faces in 
trying to retire the elders, despite his success in easing more of them 
into semiretirement at the congress. The report concedes that these 
elders?many wary of the current pace of reforms?retain great 
personal influence in their old sectors and still affect policymaking, 
despite formal retirement to the Commission. Deng's own continued 
tenure as chairman of the party Military Commission and his periodic 
need for the support of senior leaders will limit his ability to curb such 
practices.

SOUTH AFRICA: Black Activist Freed 
Top Secret 
Pretoria's release of leading ANC member Govan Mbeki probably 
does not signal the imminent release of Nelson Mandela nor is it likely 
to lead to serious negotiations with credible black leaders. At a press 
conference yesterday, Mbeki flaunted his continuing memberships in 
the South African Communist Party and the ANC, both outlawed 
groups. A government official said, however, Mbeki cannot in the 
future be quoted by the media. 
Comment: The move appears intended as a gesture to the West and 
to black leaders who have refused to participate in the government's 
proposed advisory national council until Pretoria meets several 
conditions, including the release of all political prisoners. Key black 
opposition leaders, however, will continue to reject the council as long 
as it is merely advisory, and even moderate blacks, such as Chief 
Buthelezi, will probably continue to insist on Mandela's release. 
Pretoria publicly and privately has hinted often in recent years that it 
was considering releasing Mandela and will use Mbeki's release in 
part to test domestic and international reaction. Freedom for Mandela 
is unlikely soon, however, because Pretoria realizes his release would 
result in increased domestic and foreign pressure to enter into 
open-ended political negotiations with Mandela. President Botha 
remains firmly opposed to any such talks. Pretoria probably hopes 
Mbeki's release will promote greater strife within the ANC leadership, 
a distinct  possibility given his controversial past and Communist 
ideology. 
FIJI-PAPUA NEW GUINEA: Suva Gains Diplomatic Recognition 
Papua New Guinea yesterday became the first government to 
recognize the military-led republic in Fiji established after Colonel 
Rabuka's second coup in September. Prime Minister Wingti said he 
wanted to prevent Fiji from becoming isolated following its expulsion 
from the Commonwealth last month. 
Comment: Wingti's initiative is probably an attempt to increase 
Papua New Guinea's influence among the 13-member South Pacific 
Forum and to assert its independence from dominant Australia and 
New Zealand, which are withholding recognition of the Fijian 
Government until early next year. Port Moresby's recognition is also 
aimed at maintaining relations with its ethnically linked neighbor and 
at encouraging other South Pacific governments to follow suit at a 
time when Melanesian ethnicity is a growing political force among the 
small, multiracial Pacific island states.

Special Analysis 
LIBYA-CHAD: Leadership Disparities at the Front 
The superior motivation, command flexibility, and desert fighting 
experience of Chadian commanders have earned them victories 
in four of five major battles with Libyan forces this year, despite 
Libya's advantages in manpower and weaponry. These qualities 
will play a decisive role when fighting resumes because 
Muammar Qadhafi can do little to remedy Libyan leadership 
deficiencies. 
Chadian President Habre has selected his principal commanders 
from the leading families of the nomadic northern tribes that are the 
backbone of his Army. In the war with Libya, these officers are 
fighting for and in their native territory. 
Most of Qadhafi's commanders and troops do not share his ambitions 
of conquest. Absentee leadership has also contributed to low morale,  
poor performance, and a growing desertion problem. 
25X1

Habre involves his commanders in strategic planning and allows them 
considerable latitude during combat.  25X1 
25X1 
 This flexibility has facilitated operations far from Chadian 
staging areas, such as the attack on Ma'tan as Sarra airfield in 
southern Libya in September. 25X1 
25X1 
25X1 
Libyan commanders have a much more restricted role. Qadhafi 
himself almost certainly dictated the orders for Libyan attacks on 
Fada and Aozou even though Libyan commanders in the field 
probably saw little military justification for those operations. 
Most of Chad's field commanders have lifelong experience with 
desert fighting. Habre traces his mastery of mobile offensive tactics to 
lessons learned in his youth. Libyan commanders, on the other hand, 
rely on more conventional tactics, often trained by Soviet advisers. In 
addition, Qadhafi generally has removed defeated commanders, 
preventing the accumulation of experience in the new combat arena. 
Qadhafi evidently is aware of Libya's leadership deficiencies and has 
assigned some of his more trusted commanders to the Chadian front. 
The current one, 'Ali al-Rifi al-Sharif, has developed extensive 
battlefield experience in the past few years and commanded troops 
during the retaking of Aozou village. But the task of motivating his 
officers and improving their professionalism is probably too great for 
Sharif, and Chad will  keep the edge in leadership.
