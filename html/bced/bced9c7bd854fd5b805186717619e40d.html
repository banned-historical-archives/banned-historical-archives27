 I mule.- `Excerpts from Admiral Bird's
 address as recorded in the February 25,
 11165, issue of the Guam Daily News are
 follows:
 a?'
 TAKE PULL ADVANTAGE  OF  FREE PORT -BIRD
 bear Adel. Horace V. I3ird_yesterday urged
 Guam's merchants to take full advantage of
 the island's remarkable. free port status
 and meet the present competitive prices_of
 businesses In such places as Japan,, Hong
 Kong, and the Philippines.
 He told the chamber of commerce in a
 speech 'at the Surf Club that there is a
 tremendous military payroll here and any
 local shop that "hones tly meets Japan, Hong
 Kong, or Philippine prices" would find the
 military co
 door.
 On a broader scale, he said, "suppose that
 to 180 million Americans, Guam establishes
 areputation of selling imported goods, orien-
 tal and otherwise, at prices that compare to
 Djakarta, Ban kok,  Manila,  Hong  Kong,
 Naha, or "Toll  :-' The American housewife
 will be boarding those Pan Am planes in great
 numbers to Guam," as they do now to Gan-
 der, Newfoundland; Shannon, Ireland; Ti-
 juana, Mexico; and Panama City, "all of
 which are free ports."
 ''Think this over carefully, particularly you
 merchants sitting here," he said.
 Ina 15-page address-"the longest I have
 ever made"-the commander, Naval Forces,
 Marianas gave his views, as an individual
 citizen and as a military commander, on
 Guam's economic potential.  He touched on
 a number of development possibilities for the
 territory, including tourism, trade, agricul-
 ture, transportation, and commerce, and their
 relationships, t9 the military here.
 DAILY SPENDING
 Bird said the Navy's ""daily disbursement
 which goes into the hands of the local citi-
 zenry, civilian and military, here is $266,000,"
 or $97,100,000 a year.  He said he recently
 conditeted a poll on what the .average military
 family in Guam spends on a typical flight to
 Hong Kon  or Japan, and added:
 "My findings were astonishing: The aver,-
 age military family on a,4-day trip to Hong
 Kong spends in the neighborhood 'of $800.
 W,y does this money not flow Into Guam's
 economy?
 "Some of your stores are air conditioned
 and strictly modern,  They have an interest-
 ing range of items on sale from Hong Kong
 tailoring  to  assorted , china  from  Japan.
 Souvenirs from the island and other lands
 of Micronesia are also available,  But we
 need more of this, lots more.  And, as I
 mentioned before, your retail prices must
 be in line with 9;. comparable with.prices in
 Japan, long Fong, and the Philippines"
 OPEN ,A,49A
 Prefacing his discussion on tourism, Bird
 noted that Guam. was a .restricted area 2
 years ago, "but no more, thank goodness,"
 .It Was open as Texas, and the tourists
 are soon going to find this out," he said,
 He said although Typhoon Karen retarded
 progress considerably, 'the pathways are wide
 open for taking many giant steps toward
 creating a booming tourist industry.  Moves
 are now,underway to provide adequate hotel
 and  transportation  and  a cconrpiodations.
 Distance is.no i ilger a barrier as it, was a few
 decades ago.uam is within hours 'by air
 to any point in the Western Hemisphere."
 IiARE'LYAP1'I
 Bait ,the isl?nds recreational potgiitial has
 6arely>een tapped," Bird said, and there are
 many' beauty spots and beaches that are
 natural tourist attractions,  He mentioned
 Talofvfo.Falls,,Umata,c Bay and Cocos Island
 where;1 a said-a, recreation. ,center could,oe
 developed "when the Coast Guard leaves,"
 He commends   the efforts of the local
 tourist bureau, adding that "I have pledged
 the Navy's fullest support and we are-work-
 Ing with. the bureau daily."
 On other topics, Bird had this to say:
 Guam now is on a major airline route from
 east to west, and could be the central hub
 of a north-south airline between Tokyo and
 Australia.  The new civilian air terminal to
 be erected on land recently turned over to
 the government of Guam by the Federal
 Government will be a million-dollar project.
 Seawise, there has been a buildup in
 shipping with four scheduled shipping lines
 serving the territory, and It will continue
 to increase because commerce will come to
 Guam.
 Agriculture
 Once the backbone of island economy, it
 was submerged by a military economy dur-
 ing World War II, and is emerging slowly.
 "In order to exchange farm produce with
 other nations, our agricultural experiments
 presently underway should be stepped up."
 Recreation
 "For our military community alone, Guam
 needs many more recreation facilities and
 I mean all kinds."  He suggested an amuse-
 ment park, a marina, charter boats for fish-
 ing and shelling, more conducted tours,
 "Any kind of good recreation facilities will
 do well because, gentleman, here is my big
 point-I have been talking. about tourism
 primarily as we customarily think of it-
 people from the States  coming through
 Guam.  But did you ever stop to realize
 that Guam has a built-in tourist population
 of over 20,000 In the, military alone?  I'm a
 tourist, General. Ohlke is a tourist.   And the
 military people have ready money, in their
 pocket which they would love to spend-in
 your shops and in your recreation facilities.
 And I would prefer they spend it here than
 in Hong Kong."
 DEFENSE ROLE
 Turning to Guam's defense role, Admiral
 Bird said the island "is of utmost impor-
 tance as a military base between the con-
 tinental United States and the Far East,"
 with its strategic location-"only 1,500 miles
 from our operating bases on the western
 rim of the Pacific, Japan, Okinawa and the
 Philippines.
 "Available here are all, the natural assets
 and facilities needed to  ake up a complete
 naval complex," he said.  "Guam is the one
 piece of American soil in the Western Pacific
 with a good deepwater harbor, sufficient land
 for air bases, and the repair and storage fa-
 cilities that would be needed to support a
 fleet operation * * *."
 Bird said the Navy also is assisting in the
 construction of the commercial port project.
 He said the ammunition wharf is being
 moved to the outer part of the breakwater
 and the Coast Guard is vacating Cabras Is-
 land.
 ."By relocating the ammunition wharf, a
 two million dollar project on the Navy's part,
 the commercial port will be given necessary
 ammunition clearance distances," he said.
 ..Bird also listed a number of school .pro-
 grams negotiated by OICC contractors, and
 added:
 "All in all, gentlemen, our active construc-
 tion outlay amounts to $62.9 million and
 future proposed construction amounts to
 $42.7 million, for a total figure of $105.6 mil-
 lion."
 I OUS14G NEED.                ,..
 ,Pird stressed 111.,his speech the Navy's
 housing needs which he termed-"most ur-
 gent," and which has. "become critical" with-
 in the past few months.  He said the sit-
 uation was the.result .of recent arrival of
 260 new families of Proteus personnel, and
 75 more families are waiting in the mainland
 for accommodations to become available
 He said it is the Navy's policy to rely on
 the civilian community for family housing
 "and I call on you * * * to fulfill our require-
 ments.  I also promise you that if enough
 satisfactory housing is provided for use by
 military families at a reasonable cost, addi-
 tional Government-owned housing will not
 be required.
 On the military's food requirements, he
 said most of the Navy's needs are brought in
 from the mainland or Hawaii.
 "The majority of our needs," he said, "such
 as milk, fresh vegetables, and meat, could
 be, and should be, produced locally.  This is
 an area in which your agriculture experts are
 vitally important.  If the farmers here could
 produce enough quality food to stock our
 messes and commissaries, I dare say the agri-
 culture economy would expand.
 MARGIN IN PRICES
 "But until such time as you can produce
 enough food to fulfill military requirements,
 and as long as there exists such a large mar-
 gin in prices, the military will naturally be
 compelled, to continue its .present system of
 food acquisition."
 Answering what  he termed  "rumors of
 questions such as 'Why is the, admiral stick-
 ing his nose into Guam's economic develop-
 ment'?" Bird said his "honest answer is very
 simple.  Any expansion of Guam is good for
 emergency expansion of the military."
 "It has been, and will continue to (be), the
 Navy's' job to not only defend our Nation
 but to also take every possible measure in
 supporting the success of Guam as an eco-
 nomic and commerce trading point as.well as
 a tourist attraction in the Pacific."

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. JOHN D. DINGELL
 OF MICHIGAN
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, March 15, 1965
 Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, pursuant
 to permission granted, I insert in the
 CONGRESSIONAL   RECORD   a  resolution
 adopted by the Nationalities Coordi-
 nating Committee of Detroit, Mich., on
 February 7,  1965,  The text  of the
 resolution follows:
 RESOLUTION  BY NATIONALITIES COORDINATING
 COMMITTEE OF DETROIT,  MICH.
 Whereas only a small number of the per-
 sons who participated in the, genocidal war
 crimes committed by the. Nazis have been
 brought to trial; and
 Whereas West German Prosecutor Hans-
 Joachim Kugler has estimated that it would
 take 100 specialists a year to search through
 just the U.S. Army's archives of Nazi German
 documents at Alexandria, Va.; and
 Whereas there are immense repositories of
 incriminating documents in Israel, Poland,
 the Soviet Union, and other countries still to
 be examined; and
 Whereas there would not be sufficient time
 to examine these  archives before May a,
 1965, when the statute of limitations is to
 go into effect; and
 Whereas, under articles 25 and 139 of the
 West  German  Federal  Constitution,  the
 principles of international law are to take
 precedence over the laws of, the German
 Federal Republic; and
 Whereas international law holds that. war
 crimes against humanity, genocidal acts and

 such, cannot be regarded in the category
 of ordinary crimes and are not subject to a
 statute of limitations; and
 Whereat this principle was affirmed at the
 Nuremberg  trials,  and  by  the  Potsdam
 agreement of August 2, 1945, in which It was
 pledged that war criminals and all those who
 took part in the planning and carrying out
 of Nazi measures which involved or resulted
 in war crimes were to be arrested and brought
 to justice; and
 Whereas  other  nations,  among  them
 France, Belgium, Poland, Hungary, the So-
 viet Union, and Israel, have eliminated the
 statute of limitations on war crimes; and
 Whereas West Germany can also eliminate
 the statute of limitations on Nazi war crimes
 without conflict with its Constitution; and
 Whereas West Germany has a moral re-
 sponsibility to do everything in its power to
 bring every Nazi war criminal to trial and
 justice; and
 Whereas world public opinion has urged
 the elimination of the statute of limita-
 tions by West Germany: Therefore be it
 Resolved, That we go on record as endors-
 ing this sentiment and alining ourselves
 with it; and further be it
 Resolved, That we urge the West German
 Government to rescind its decision to apply
 a, statute of limitations on Nazi war crimes
 effective May 8, 1965, and that instead it ex-
 tend the period for at least 10 years or
 without limitation; and further be it
 Resolved, That we call upon the President
 of the United States to use his good offices in
 this regard and upon Congress to act also,,
 and further be it
 Resolved, that copies of this resolution be
 sent to the Ambassador of the German Fed-
 eral Republic, the President of the United
 :states, the Secretary of State, and Congress

 Or NEW YORE
 DULSKI
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, March 15, 1965
 BANNED
 As I stood there at the entrance to the
 covered railroad bridge, one of the soldiers
 whipped out a camera and began "shooting"
 me.
 The British Information service officer who
 accompanied me to the border said this is a
 favorite pastime of the Red border guards
 and that undoubtedly my picture will be
 filed in their police records.
 There  were  no  exchange  photographic
 privileges at the border point.  A sign pro-
 claimed: "Taking of photographs in this par-
 ticular area is prohibited."
 I was told that the British once permitted
 picturetaking from their side, but the Com-
 munists  complained  so                                                                            bitterly  that  the
 practice was stopped.  Instead, the British
 have sought not to offend their truculent
 neighbors, even to the point of setting up a
 checkpoint about a mile from the border,
 beyond which the casual visitor is not al-
 lowed.
 PASS
 I was allowed beyond the checkpoint only
 after the British Information Service had
 taken considerable time and trouble to get
 me a pass.
 The border scene on this bright morning
 brought to mind the famous ad of an east-
 ern railroad in the United States in an effort
 to provide cross-country passenger travel
 without changing trains in Chicago.
 The ad showed a pig lolling smugly in a
 livestock railroad car and the caption was:
 "A pig can travel cross country by rail with-
 out changing, but you can't."
 Well, that's what happens at Lu Wu.  The
 Communist-operated portion of the Canton-
 Kowloon railroad will bring passengers per-
 mitted to enter Hong Kong to the Red Chi-
 nese side of the Lu Wu border point, where
 they must disembark with their luggage.
 i       PEDESTRIANS
 If their papers are in order, they are then
 permitted to cross the bridge on foot, and if
 their papers are in order on the other side.
 they board the British-operated portion of
 the  railroad and                     complete  their  journey.
 The situation is the same in reverse for the
 Honk Kong passengers wishing to enter Red
 China.
 But the porkers have it much easier.                         On
 the morning of our visit, the Commies per-
 mitted a British diesel engine to cross the

 And well they might for only 2 years ago,               On the evening before, we were drinking
 someone had smuggled a home-made bomb                   some local Hong Kong beer in the company
 into a suitcase that went off in the customs-           of Buffalo's Neal T. Donnelly and his wife,
 house on the Red Chinese side of the border,            the former Jean McGowan of Buffalo.
 A member of the U.S. Information Service
 group  in Hong Kong, Donnelly  remarked
 casually: "That beer you're drinking is made
 in part with Communist water."
 The British have worked out elaborate
 arrangements with the Communists to supply
 water to their colony.  Eventually,` the Com-
 mies will be supplying up to a third of the
 colony's Water supply.
 USEFUL
 The British do not seem worried about the
 fact that the Red Chinese could pull a Castro
 and shut off the spigot, as the Cuban dictator
 did at the Guantanamo Naval Base in Cuba.
 The British are gambling that it is to the
 Red Chinese interests to continue to permit
 this tiny outpost of the :free world to operate
 in its own capitalistic way.  After all, the
 Commies do get foreign exchange from the
 goods they supply the British  and per-
 haps they find the port useful, too, for
 listening post purposes.
 The island bf Hong Kong and the city
 across the harbor, Kowloon, were ceded to
 the British in pre-Commie days in perpetuity.
 In addition, about 400 miles of so=called new
 territory surrounding Kowloon was deeded
 over to the British on a 99-year lease, on
 which there is still 35 years to run.
 TRAFFIC
 The traffic of both persons and goods is
 quite considerable both ways. In 1962, the
 flow of Chinese into Hong Kong assumed
 tremendous proportions when for some rea-
 son the Communists allowed their starving
 to enter the British colony in droves.  At the
 peak of the influx, some 200,000 disenchanted
 Chinese attempted to cross the border and
 approximately 140,000 made it.
 This created tremendous assimilation prob-
 lems for the British, where the availability
 of land for housing, water for drinking and
 food  grown locally  are  inadequate.  The
 British have shown considerable ingenuity
 in acquiring extra land by leveling off hills
 Into the sea, by ambitious water-supply proj-
 ects and by tremendous housing projects,
 geared to the varying income patterns of the
 Chinese immigrants.
 SLOWER
 The  flow of                                                    Chinese  immigrants  has
 leveled off to no more than 50 each day of
 legal entries-comprising mostly the old and
 sick the Commies are willing to wish off on
 the British-and perhaps up to 250 a month
 of illegal immigrants.
 The British consider that the dropoff is
 attributable to better economic conditions in
 Red China.  Since the Chinese abandoned
 their great leap forward-the means by
 which they hoped to catch up with the in-
 dustrial nations of the world at the expense
 of the consumer goods and amount of food
 for distribution--of the consumer goods and
 amount of food for distribution-agricul-
 tural production is up and the economic situ-
 ation has in general improved.
 Just returned from a month's visit to.Red
 China, Harry F. Stanley, executive director
 of the Hong Kong Tourist Association, told
 this correspondent that he found conditions
 in Red China much better than he expected.
 CLEAN
 Stanley said he was surprised to note in
 .Canton, Hangchow, Shanghai, and Peiping
 that they were among the cleanest cities he
 has seen in the Orient.
 "The Government wages a constant propa-
 ganda drive on keeping clean," he said, "so
 much so that when I dropped a cigar on the
 street, I was tapped politely on the shoulder
 and told  to  put  it in a nearby trash
 -
 receptacle."
 Trains arrive and depart on time in Red
 China, he said, and while the clothing is
 simple and inexpensive looking, it is by no
 means drab and dirty.
 FREEDOM
 Stanley was given freedom to come and go
 as he chose and the Chinese Reds even asked

 though at present the Chinese Reds lack
 sufficient -hotel, Accommodations and inter-
 preters, they expect to have both in sufficient
 -supply in the future and then make a strong
 bid f9r.the, vlQrld tourist trade.
 They have already started in that direc-
 tion by printing the finest quality travel
 brochures Stanley has,seen in any country.
 Stanley in his travels did not hear much
 anti-American comment, but he did hear
 anti-Russian diatribes, in which the Soviets
 were accused of walking out on their Chi-
 nese brothers.  Stanley noted a lack of ade-
 quite transportation facilities in the motor
 line and in one city-Shanghai-there was
 a glumness over hard times and the fact that
 the people there were being ordered to other
 cities.
 ?  GAY
 In Peiping, the atmosphere was gayer,
 especially when a foreign dignitary the Red
 Chinese wanted to impress was present.
 'k'he,Stanley visit coincided with the visit of
 the Deputy Prime Minister of Zanzibar, for
 Which a full morning of parading Commu-
 nist b ndo and marching units were staged.
 Whil&Stanley was impressed with what he
 saw, he thinks in the long run the Chinese
 Communists will not succeed in their desire
 to dominate the world.  The Chinese are
 much too, individualistic, he feels, to have
 the  overall  discipline  to  support  world
 conquest.
 In other words, Stanley seemed to think
 that in the short run the Chinese Com-
 munists were doing rather well, but that in
 the long run they will fail.
 DIFFER
 The American' colony here seems to be in
 disagreement  even                  with  this  short-run
 This' correspondent was told that while
 Agricultural production is indeed higher than
 in the famine years, it has only risen 'to
 about the point it was in 1967.  In order to
 feed its masses, the Red Chinese are having
 to buy heavily abroad, about 6 million tons a
 year, largely from Canada and Australia.
 This represents about 30 percent of China's
 grain supply and the Chinese are having to
 use, their foreign exchange in great quanti-
 ties,  The more they have to buy food, the
 less they have to acquire foreign hardware
 to help In their expansions drive.
 . The Americans hear that the Red Com-
 munist leadership is as militant as ever in
 wanting to chase American influence out
 of the Far East.  The Vietcong war against
 the Americans in South Vietnam Is heavily
 supported by Mao Tse-tung, chairman of the
 Chinese  Communist  Party,  Chou  En-lai,
 premier, and Liu Shao-chi, vice chairman of
 the Chinese Communist Party.
 HATRED
 There is? not the slightest desire on ' the
 part of this leadership to have any truck
 with the hated- Americans.  Mao in recent
 years has developed a fanantic, hatred for
 the Americans, stemming in part .from the
 fact that ~hfe son was killed in, the Korean
 war in part from the frustration of seeing
 the Americans thwart his expansionist poli-
 cies around the world.
 If left up to Mao and his cronies, the drive
 to expel the American from a dominating
 position in non-Communist Asia, Africa and
 Latin America will go relentlessly forward in
 savage fashion.
 ,,. STRENGTH.-
 , In Hong Kong, a lessening of world ten-
 sions through a curbing of the Chinese de-
 sire to subvert the world is not seen possible
 in the foreseeable future.  Only if the Mao
 leadership is inherited by younger, more
 flexible Communist leaders might a turning
 point be reached.
 It is the opinion here that the drive against
 the Asian Reds in Vietnam and elsewhere
 must be resolutely carried on,
 The only thing American the Mao crew re-
 spects 1s armed strength.  Any weakness
 shown by the Americans* in Vietnam and
 elsewhere will be exploited to the hilt by
 the Red Chinese.
 It boil  down to a war of survival between
 the two systems.

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. LEONOR K. SULLIVAN
 OF MISSOURI
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, March 15, 1965
 Mrs. SULLIVAN.  Mr. Speaker, I have
 enjoyed for the past 10 years the privilege
 of serving on the Subcommittee on Hous-
 ing of the House Committee on Banking
 and Currency, and the opportunity to
 help write laws which now provide so
 much help to the average American fam-
 ily-and to all families-to achieve bet-
 ter living conditions in our expanding
 cities and suburban areas, and in rural
 areas, too.  Since the end of World War
 II, America    has become a Nation of
 homeowners. But slums remain uncon-
 quered and the problems of assuring de-
 cent housing for low-income families
 still persist.
 This morning, on the invitation of Mr.
 Nathaniel S. Keith, president of the Na-
 tional Housing Conference, I participated
 in a general session of the 34th annual
 convention of this outstanding organiza-
 tion and discussed some of the many
 problems we are facing and trying to
 solve in the field of housing and com-
 munity  development.  The  National
 Housing Conference has contributed tre-
 mendous leadership and imagination to
 the solution of these problems ever since
 it was organized during the depths of
 the great depression in 1931.
 The point I tried to stress in my ad-
 dress, Mr. Speaker, was the need for the
 instilling of motivation and responsibil-
 ity in the families we are trying to help
 most-motivation to want to improve
 their living standards and a sense of re-
 sponsibility for the programs geared to
 help them.  As I see it, we should try to
 encourage every family needing assist-
 ance in the aehievel7tient of better, hous-
 ing to: identify itself with middle-class
 America and seek to become a part of it,
 Years ago, the Communists-and some
 non-Communist  intellectuals-sneered
 at middle-class standards and middle-
 class goals.  But today, I think most
 American families  are  "middle, clis$,"
 aid proud of it, and I think it is a mighty
 good group to be part of.  Every Ameri-
 can family should be helped to reach that
 level; and that means not only the
 achievement of more comforts of living,
 but also of the sense of responsibility and
 morality which traditionally go with
 "middle class" standards.
 My remarks, Mr,. ,Speaker, were as
 as

 ADDRESS BY CONGRESSWOMAN LEONOR X. SUL-
 LIVAN,  DEMOCRAT,  OF  MISSOURI,                                                          AT  34TH
 ANNUAL CONVENTION OF NATIONAL HOUSING
 CONFERENCE, WASHINGTON, D.C., MARCH 15,
 1965
 It would be  impossible for a longtime
 member of the Subcommittee on Housing of
 the  House  Committee  on  Banking  and
 Currency not to feel completely at home at a
 convention session of the National Housing
 Conference, particularly with my former col-
 league in the House, Senator WILLIAMS of
 New Jersey. sharing the speaking program
 today and with "Mr. Housing and Redevel-
 opment" of my hometown of St. Louis, Char-
 lie Parris, serving as chairman of this meet-
 ing.
 I am delighted to be able to join you this
 morning to discuss some of our mutual prob-
 lems in this great work of remaking our cities
 into a proper environment for the Great So-
 ciety.
 We still have a long, long, road to travel
 to reach that destination.
 But I do not say that in despair, or even
 in discouragement; and certainly not,in dis-
 paragement, either.  Looking back on the
 long road we have already traveled in pursuit
 of the goal of good housing and adequate
 community facilities for our expanding popu-
 lation, I sincerely believe we have much to
 be proud of, even though our cities are no
 Eden, by any means.  If we want to com-
 fort ourselves further, we need only remem-
 ber that-speaking of our cities and their
 failure to approach Eden-there was sin in
 Eden, too.
 The  National   Housing  Conference  was
 formed at a time when only idiots and vision-
 aries saw any horizon of hope for the future
 of America and her cities. In 1931, the goal
 of a decent home for every American was
 realistic only in terms of getting people in out
 of the rain-and for many Americans, an
 abandoned coke oven or a packing box under
 a bridge abutment fulfilled this minimum
 ambition.
 THE CHALLENGES TO OUR CITIES
 In the 34 years in which your organization
 has been in existence, our Nation has been
 transformed from a miserably poor to an
 affluent population, and from a nation of
 renters and transients into one of home-
 owners.  Nevertheless, there is still at least
 as much need now for the continued efforts
 and drive of this organization as there was
 before the Federal Housing Act made home-
 ownership a practical reality, or the Hous-
 ing Act of 1937 established the principle of
 public housing, or the Housing Act of 1949
 accomplished  the  great  breakthrough  of
 urban renewal.  For, despite the rows of
 ramblers marching across suburbia, and the
 high-rise apartments-public or private-co-
 op or condominiums-dotting our cities, and
 rising particularly in the expanses of empty
 land in urban renewal areas, we all know very
 well that the vigorous running we have done
 since 1937 to try to eradicate slums and re-
 place them with good housing has hardly
 done more than keep us even-as if we were
 on a treadmill.
 The cities have been magnets for the dis-
 advantaged and dispossessed from rural areas
 all over America; they have come to settle
 alongside of, or in the same buildings or
 even the same dwelling units with, our hard-
 luck  urban   families.  We  shuffle  them
 around from time to time as new structures
 are erected on the sites where they had lived,
 but in a great many cases they do not find
 themselves in any better environment and
 often it is worse. The cities have made a
 remarkable comeback since President Tru-
 man put through the 1949 act, but many of
 the people In the cities, no matter how good
 their housing, are trapped in giant spider
 webs of congested, dirty streets, and a miasma
 of environmental pollution of every kind,
 not to mention a crime problem which sends
 shivers through us every time we read a
 newspaper or hear a newscast of the latest

 beatings, knifings, shootings, robberies, and
 vandalism.
 And I don't think we have faced up to the
 criticisms with sufficient courage or candor.
 I can illustrate that best, I believe, with a
 personal recollection.
 Several years ago, during our subcommit-
 tee hearings on an omnibus housing bill, I
 raised a lot of questions about the law and
 the practices under which public housing
 operates.   I  always  raise  such  questions
 whenever I have an opportunity to discuss
 this matter with informed people.  I have
 done so in all of our hearings over the years.
 I have bitterly condemned the restrictions
 which make it necessary--or seemingly nec-
 essary-to build high-rise apartment struc-
 tures for low-income families with young
 children.  I know there are dollar limitations
 on dwelling unit costs under public housing.
 I know that land in our central cities is ter-
 ribly expensive, and that a high-rise is much
 more economical to build than a similar
 number of units in garden-type buildings.
 But until we get out of this format for family
 dwelling units, I will continue to be critical.
 I constantly raised questions about the pay
 scales for the people who do the actual inter-
 viewing of prospective tenants.  I feel that
 we need our very best staff people in those
 jobs-these-are the critical points of contact
 with people who will make or break a public
 housing project.
 I urged an opening up of the projects to
 Intensive community education and social
 rehabilitation work-such as we are doing In
 St. Louis through the University of Missouri
 Extension Service and trained social workers
 on an experimental basis.
 WE MUST NEVER CLOSE OUR EYES TO PROGRAM
 FAULTS
 I wanted to know how urgently the housing
 authorities were tackling the project crime
 problem-using our own diligent efforts in
 this direction in St. Louis as a yardstick.  I
 pressed for information on the methods used
 to impart a higher sense of responsibility
 among the tenants for protection of the
 property and to help through example and
 Interest to raise standards all along the line.
 Certainly these were critical questions and
 were based on a conviction that all In public
 housing was far from well.
 But imagine my complete surprise one day
 when a good friend came to see me-one who
 knew my record over the years on housing
 legislation and who knew I was a friend of
 good housing for all Americans-and re-
 ported to me that the word had gotten
 around that I was going to oppose new funds
 for public housing.
 Had I changed my mind-done a flip-flop-
 run out on my own voting record?
 I was flabbergasted.  I find it somewhat
 amusing now to look back on the experience,
 but I was not amused at the time. Together,
 my friend and I went through the transcript
 of the most recent hearing in which I had
 raised so many questions. When we finished,
 my visitor said:
 "If everyone were as much an `enemy' of
 public housing as you are we'd have the most
 successful public housing program in the
 world for it Is obvious you want the program
 to succeed, not fail."
 I believe that with the help and assistance
 of the antipoverty program, we are now
 getting down to essentials.  We are going
 to work much more with people, instead of
 just bricks and mortar, In making public
 housing more effective as an instrument of
 social progress.
 PROJECT DESIGNED FOR  GENERATIONS  AGO
 It is just too bad that much of this could
 not have been accomplished long before now,
 without waiting for the passage of the Eco-
 nomic Opportunity Act of 1964.  We have
 had a golden opportunity in the public hous-
 ing program for 28 years to do the things
 we are now going to do.
 Everyone in this room, 'I am sure, is an
 enthusiastic supporter of the goals of the
 antipoverty program.  Most  of you  have
 been trying to achieve these same goals for
 as long as you have been identified with or
 interested in public policy. But housing
 people have not always had community sup-
 port for these goals, and sometimes it was
 necessary to go along with community atti-
 tudes rather than to try to overcome them.
 When public housing first came in, a gen-
 eration and a half ago, the projects were
 plain,  raw,  far  from  luxurious,  but were
 heaven for the people who moved Into them
 from festering slums.  Practically everyone
 was poor in the thirties, and the slum-dwell-
 ers eligible for public housing were a pretty
 good cross section of urban America.  For
 those with motivation, and some education,
 the housing projects were a welcome way
 station on the way to a better life.  The
 tenants took fierce pride in their new homes,
 and in the neighborly life of the new com-
 munity.  The public housing we have today,
 however, is largely designed for that urban
 life of a generation ago.  In the meantime,
 as wage levels rose, and employment oppor-
 tunities expanded, the income limitations
 more and more tended to restrict public
 housing to disadvantaged families which
 made the projects their permanent resi-
 dences,
 GETTING  MORE  FAMILIES  OUT  OF  PUBLIC
 HOUSING
 Now we have got to work at getting more
 families out of public housing by helping
 them to train for better employment oppor-
 tunities.                                                                                                                                                             We have got to help get the chil-
 dren into college-if they have the capacity-
 or into vocational classes which can train
 them in today's technical skills.  The hous-
 ing project, in my opinion, is a perfect bat-
 tleground for one of the most important en-
 gagements of the war on poverty,  Thanks
 to President Johnson's multiweapon attack
 on poverty, we have many new tools we can
 use.  The important thing, however, must
 be personal motivation.
 We can't do the job which must be done
 with our impoverished families merely by
 providing a clean apartment in a building
 equipped with all modern improvements.
 In addition to AMI, we need AOM-all out
 motivation. There is no reason whatsoever-
 with the opportunities which now exist for
 any youngster to get a good education-for
 project kids to be dropouts because of a
 sense of what's the use.  There Is a use.  If
 their families won't or can't get on the tails
 of these youngsters to push them into the
 path of their beckoning opportunities, then
 society has got to provide that push.   Those
 who run our public housing programs have
 a magnificent opportunity to provide some
 of that inspiration-and there are countless
 community  organizations,  from  the      Cub
 Scouts on up to an urban equivalent of the
 4-11 Clubs, to provide know-how and active
 assistance.
 We constantly hear, in the Subcommittee
 on Housing, that public housing has limita-
 tions; that it can't provide the complete an-
 swer to the housing needs of the Nation,
 that it has been undernourished in terms
 of congressional support and community ac-
 ceptance, and so on and so on.  All of us
 know those statements to be true.
 RESPONSIBILITY ON TENANTS
 But I feel that we have not accomplished
 nearly as much as we could have accom-
 plished with the public housing program we
 already have.  And because we haven't done
 more than has been done, the necessary pub-
 lic and congressional support to accomplish
 the necessary expansion of public housing
 has been denied to us.  Thus, after a good
 fast start in the late thirties, and again after
 World War II, public housing became almost
 a bad word on the Hill, and in countless
 communities, and at one point we had to
 fight merely to keep the program from being
 abandoned.  The advocates of public hous-
 If I may say so, the troubles in our cities
 today are to a certain extent, your fault.  I
 mean that seriously. I know you are decent,
 hard-working, upstanding people-that you
 are dedicated to the cause of good housing
 in communities where people can live to-
 gether in comfort and contentment.                        But
 with all you have accomplished in these past
 34 years as an organization, you-have never-
 theless failed.
 . You have failed not because of lack of
 hard work on your own part; but you have
 failed  because  you  haven't  imparted  to
 enough of your neighbors in your own com-
 munities the excitement which you your-
 selves have felt in tackling this great chal-
 lenge.
 In other words, too much of the housing
 and community' development effort of the
 past 34 years has been the dedicated effort
 of a few, rather than the mass effort of the
 whole community.
 Let me give the perfect example.  In my
 own city, the fruits of urban renewal are
 beginning to appear In great clusters.  A
 tour through the renewal areas is a thrilling
 experience, particularly for those who re-
 member the forbidding slums and ugly ware-
 houses and rundown Industrial plants and
 pot-holed streets and the other eye-sores
 which used to pcoupy the same land. But in
 the years in which these marvels of redevel-
 opments were being planned, the empty
 land, to thousands of Impatient St. Loui-
 slans, was an eloquent testimonial'to public
 waste and planned chaos.
 Southwest Washington for years presented
 a simillar picture of a war-ravaged waste-
 land before the new buildings began to rise
 and the surge of revitalization began.
 Artists' renditions of how something Is go-
 ing to look years hence are seldom convinc-
 ing to the people who see a teeming area of
 a city turned into a vast and silent ceme-
 tery for rubble and fill. Critical citizens add
 on to the proposed resale subsidy of a re-
 development area the total of taxes lost dur-
 ing the period the land lies fallow, and what
 apepars sometimes to be a top-heavy bu-
 reaucracy of planners, architects, adminis-
 trators and real estate lawyers, and come to
 the conclusion that urban renewal is going
 to destroy the city's solvency-and that of
 Uncle Sam as well.  Farsighted elective of-
 ficials go down to defeat as bumblers and
 wasters.  Then, years later, when the spec-
 tacular results are clearly visible, no one
 even bothers to remember the identities of
 the officials who sacrificed their careers for
 what seemed to be a giant boondoggle.
 I use urban renewal as an example of poor
 comunication to the public, only because it
 is such a glaringly obvious one.  On a less
 spectacular level, however, everything about
 community development, and' particularly
 public housing, suffers from the same lag in
 community understanding and effective com-
 munication.
 PROBLEMS IN PUBLIC HOUSING
 I have served on the Housing Subcommit-
 tee since it was established by Brent Spence
 in 1955, with Albert Rains as our first and,
 until this year, only chairman.  During all
 of that time, and for years before that, pub-
 lic housing has been the whipping boy in all
 of the housing bills and in all of the appro-
 priation bills which Included funds for hous-
 ing programs.  Yet without public housing,
 we could never have begun to carry out our
 relocation programs, and without substan-
 tially more public housing-or the alterna-
 tive of rent subsidies proposedby the Presi-
 dent-we will find It more and more difficult
 to clear the sites for further civic improve-
 ments.
 There are many reasons why public hous-
 ing has suffered so consistently from attack.

 Hospital, Chicago (Research), Northwestern
 University; Veterans' Administration Hospi-
 tal, Hines, Loyola University; Veterans' Ad-
 ministration Hospital, Chicago (South Side),
 University of Chicago.
 Medical facilities and personnel are, of
 course 'in critically short supply nationally.
 Therefore, any organization such as the Vet-
 erans' Administration that controls a sig-
 nificant proportion of such facilities and
 personnel bears the heavy responsibility, in
 fact the moral duty, of employing them to
 their maximum potential.  Certainly, beds
 cannot be permitted to lie comparatively fal-
 low in some, areas, while other areas suffer
 from an inordinate shortage of VA hospital
 beds.
 I believe this preamble points to the ob-
 viousreply to your letter: that the decision
 to close hospitals in areas where demand is
 not great will have absolutely no adverse ef-
 fect on new hospitals planned for Illinois,
 and,, this most definitely includes construc-
 tion at the Chicago (South Side) and Hines
 hospitals, which will go forward at optimum
 speed. In fact, since the VA operates within
 a ceiling of 125,000 beds, the closing of mar-
 ginal hospitals will simply permit us to trans-
 fer capacity to areas which have insufficient
 beds.
 Finally, I hope that you will feel free at
 any time to inquire about the progress of the
 VA medical program in Illinois or on other
 Inatters.ai'ecting your constituents.
 Sincerely,
 W. J. DRrvER, Administrator.
 Reader's Digest Publishers Receive
 Freedom Foundation Award
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. FRANK T. BOW
 or OHIO
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, March 15, 1965
 Mr. 130W., Mr. Speaker, early last
 week at Valley, Forge, one great American
 institution honored another. The Free-
 doms Foundation annual George Wash-
 ington award was presented to the pub-
 lishers and editors of the Reader's Digest,
 Mr. and Mrs. DeWitt Wallace.
 The Freedoms Foundation for, 16 years
 has been making annual awards to those
 organizations, schools, and individuals
 who have made contributions toward a
 better understanding and a greater ap-
 preciation of the American way of life.
 The enormous popularity of the Read-
 er's Digest, measured by the most indica
 tive. yardstick, is sufficient testimony to
 this publication's acceptance and impact.
 In an era when to criticize and lam-
 bast the American traditions 'and ideals
 seems to be the fashion, 1" am comforted
 in the knowledge that at'least one widely
 read periodical is still carrying the ban-.
 ner of free enterprise and individual lib-
 erties.
 The George Washington award cita-
 tion to the Wallaces follows:
 For epitomizing responsible citizenship, for
 excellence in civic affairs, for aggressive lead-
 ership in the propagation of American fun-
 damentals during more than a quarter of a
 century of outstanding service to God and
 country through the domestic and foreign
 editions of Reader's Digest, Freedoms Foun-
 dation at Valley Forge salutes these exem-
 plars of steadfast faith in free enterprise who
 have built, from small beginnings to interna-
 tional leadership, a mighty enterprise inval-
 uable in the continuing fight for freedom and
 dignity of every individual.
 Pro1essor Supports President
 in Vietnam
 ON OF REMARKS
 TENSI
 EX
 OF
 HON. W. J. BRYAN DORN
 Or SOUTH CAROLINA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, March 3, 1965
 Mr. DORN.  Mr. Speaker, some of the
 paid advertisements in a few of our news-
 papers give the impression that the aca-
 demic community is highly critical of
 President Johnson's Vietnam policy.  It
 is interesting to note that the profes-
 sional qualifications listed in some of
 these paid advertisements include "psy-
 chology," "microbiology," "chemistry,"
 and the like. But the American people
 should note that such paid advertise-
 ments hardly represent the majority of
 the academic community. This is espe-
 cially true of university professors in the
 field of international relations.
 .Yesterday  Prof.  James  A.  Atkin-
 son, of Georgetown University, a well-
 known analyst of military and foreign
 affairs, appeared on "Georgetown Uni-
 versity Forum" in support of President
 Lyndon B. Johnson's foreign policy in
 South Vietnam.
 Mr. Speaker, I am sure that a vast ma-
 jority of the professors and ministers of
 the Gospel are supporting the President
 in Vietnam despite recent paid advertise-
 ments to the contrary. Incidentally, one
 advertisement alone in the New York
 Times, signed by 'a group of professors
 advocating withdrawal from South Viet-
 nam, cost in the neighborhood of $10,000.
 It might be proper to ask who is supply-
 ing these fantastic sums of money ad-
 vocating a policy of appeasement and
 retreat?
 Mr. Speaker, recently Dr. Atkinson
 wrote a brilliant defense of President
 Johnson's Vietnam policy.  Writing in
 the Washington Report of the American
 Security Council, Professor Atkinson
 pointed out that the President's wise and
 firm policy was based on the clear lesson
 that our own security as a nation is inti-
 mately related to the peace of Asia.
 President Johnson's position is that
 America dare not ignore the commit-
 ment that three Presidents have made
 to support our friends against Commu=
 nist aggression. In doing this, says At-
 kinson, tlie-?resident is supplying the
 kind" of vigorous leadership for a firm
 policy in Vietnam today which is the best
 guarantee of avoiding a general war to-
 morrow.

 Faith in American Teenagers
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. JOHN J. FLYNT, JR.
 OF GEORGIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, March 9, 1965
 Mr. FLYNT.                                                                                Mr. Speaker, the teen-
 ager of America has been pictured as
 irresponsible, reckless, and wild.  Unfor-
 tunately, the few who deserve this de-
 scription frequently overshadow the ma-
 jority of our young people who are, in a
 quiet way, striving to live equitably in
 the world which surrounds them.          I
 have great faith in our young people and
 I am always pleased when an opportunity
 arises which allows me to restate this
 faith and to share it with others.
 Such an opportunity has just been
 brought to my attention by Mr. Allen
 J. Dennis, foreman of the Bibb County
 grand jury, who lives in Macon, Ga.
 The interschool student council, an
 organization composed of representa-
 tives from the Macon, Bibb County, pub-
 lic high schools, has adopted a resolution
 opposing the availability of vulgar and
 obscene publications on newsstands and
 in the stores of Macon.
 That these young people are striving
 to constructively mold their environment
 proves that they are willing and eager to
 assume responsibility.  They go further
 than merely accepting responsibility;
 they seek to lead others by recommend-
 ing "to each student council of Bibb
 County high schools that they instigate
 a campaign urging students of their
 schools boycott all such publications-
 salicious literature-and request news-
 dealers to remove these. publications
 from their shelves,"
 The members of the Inter-School Stu-
 dent Council of Bibb County are to be
 commended for the stand they have
 taken. Their action is the result of care-
 ful and. conscientious consideration and,
 I believe, deserves, in turn, the attention
 of us adults whose duty it must be to lend
 them support.
 I herewith submit the letter Mr. Allen
 J. Dennis wrote to me, Mr. Dennis' letter
 of congratulations to the council, and the
 resolution of the Inter-School Student
 Council of Bibb County:
 MARCH 2, 1965.
 HOn. JOHN J. FLYNT, JR.,
 House Office Building,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR  MR.  FLYNT: Because  I think it is
 noteworthy and will be of interest to you, I
 am enclosing a copy of a resolution adopted
 by the Inter-School Student Council, an or-
 ganization composed of representatives from
 the Macon, Bibb County, public high schools,
 concerning salacious literature.  This reso-
 lution came to the attention of the Bibb
 County Grand Jury in their meeting today.
 As foreman of the grand jury, I wrote a let-
 ter to the president of the Inter-School Stu-
 dent Council to compliment them on the
 stand they had taken and I am attaching
 copy of this letter also.
 If you agree that this is a noteworthy and
 commendable stand these youngsters have
 taken, you may want to have it carried in
 the Appendix of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.
 With every good wish, I am,
 Sincerely yours,
 ALLEN J. DENNIS.

 also participated in various war missions
 conducted by United States and South
 Vietnam forces.
 His observations should be carefully
 noted by those in Congress and elsewhere
 who are wondering about the effective-
 ness of our policies there, and whether
 or not there is a chance of winning this
 conflict.
 Mr. Warren is a former president of the
 National Press Club of Washington, and
 has been a Washington correspondent
 for the past 20 years.
 Under leave to extend my remarks, I
 include his column which appeared in
 the Courier-Express on March 5, 1965:
 IN  WASHINGTON:  BACKING  GIVEN  To  U.S.
 POSITION IN VIETNAM WAR
 (By Lucian C. Warren)
 WASHINGTON.-The series of stories this
 correspondent wrote in Vietnam concludes
 Saturday.  They were written on the scene
 in Vietnam and airmailed to Buffalo. Mean-
 while, we have returned to Washington be-
 fore completion of the series.                                                                  We have had
 a chance to see and hear various viewpoints
 about the war, this time, from the home-
 front.                                                                  It is to these viewpoints we address
 ourselves now.
 DIFT'ERENCE
 There is considerable difference of opinion
 at home, much more so than among the
 Americans serving in Vietnam, about the ad-
 visability of continuing the war there and
 of negotiating with the Communists for a
 settlement.
 Certain columnists, led by Drew Pearson
 and Walter Lippmann, and certain newspa-
 pers, led by the New York Times and the St.
 Louis Post Dispatch, appear to think it is evil
 to continue the war there and that negotia-
 tions with the Communists are highly over-
 due.
 On Capitol Hill, there are also influential
 voices raised in doubt over the U.S. course
 in Vietnam, Senators WAYNE MORSE, Demo-
 crat, of Oregon, FRANK CHURCH, Democrat,
 of Idaho, and GEORGE McGovEaN, Democrat,
 of South Dakota, are among those who have
 denounced present policy there.
 TREND
 While there are varying shades of opinion,
 we would like to summarize the main trends,
 along with our own comments, in defense-
 in the main-of the U.S. conduct of the war
 and its refusal thus far to enter into negotia-
 tions.
 These opinions were formed without pres-
 sure from the U.S. Government and with the
 benefit of some 2 weeks of on-the-scene ob-
 servations in the wide Vietnamese warfront.
 Our summary follows :
 Thesis
 The Vietcong are ruthless and dedicated
 warriors who are winning the guerrilla war,
 while the South Vietnamese are ineffective
 soldiers, operating under poor military ad-
 vice from the United States.
 Mr. 'STEVE JOHNSON,
 President, Inter-School Student Council,
 Macon, Ga.
 DEAR STEVE: This morning at the meeting
 of the grand jury of Bibb Co my reference
 was made to the resolution adopted by the
 student council concerning the increasing
 availability of vulgar and obscene publica-
 tions on the newsstands and in the stores
 of Macon.
 As foreman of the grand jury, I want to
 compliment and congratulate the student
 council on the stand they have taken.
 It will be of interest to you to know that
 the grand jury has a committee on sub-
 versive activities, pornography, and obscene
 literature.  It may be that the chairman or a
 member of the committee will want to dis-
 cuss this with you in more detail for it is
 an area of much concern to the grand jury.
 As a result of high court rulings, very
 little can be expected now through legal ac-
 tion.          It is an area that was formerly in-
 fluenced by legal discipline but no longer is
 this the case.  Henceforth, it must be con-
 trolled by individual moral discipline,, re-
 ligious  influence, and                   an atmosphere  or
 climate or community conscience  that is
 rather loosely referred tows public opinion.
 With every good wish, I am,
 Sincerely yours,
 ALLEN J. DENNIS,
 Forman, Bibb County Grand Jury.
 RESOLUTION ADOPTED  BY INTERSCHOOL  STU-
 DENT COUNCIL OF MACON, BIBB COUNTY, GA.
 Whereas the members of the interschool
 student council of Bibb County are deeply
 concerned with the increasing availability
 of vulgar  and  obscene  publications on
 newstands and in the stores of Macon; and
 Whereas the interschool student council
 believes that such publications create an
 atmosphere in the community that is not
 conducive to clean living; and
 Whereas the interschool student council
 feels that such publications have a demoral-
 izing effect on the youth of Macon; and
 Whereas the interschool student council
 believes that such publications contribute to
 delinquency in Macon; and
 Whereas the interschool student council
 feels that Macon youth need to be encour-
 aged in and guided to high ideals; Therefore
 be it
 Resolved, That interschool student coun-
 cil of Bibb County does hereby recommend
 to each student council of Bibb County high
 schools that they instigate a campaign urg-
 ing students of their schools boycott all such
 publications and request local. newsdealers
 to  remove  these  publications  from  their
 shelves.

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. THADDEUS J. DULSKI
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, March 15, 1965
 Mr. DULSKI.           Mr. Speaker, this is the
 last in. a series of 14 articles and 2 side
 columns written by Mr. Lucian C. War-
 ren, chief of the Washington bureau of
 the Courier-Express, Buffalo, N.Y., in
 which he has reported on his recent trip
 to South Vietnam and to Hong Kong.
 I have commended this series to my
 colleagues as a firsthand report of an able
 and  experienced  news5aperman who
 talked to many people in Asia, and who
 Comment
 Not so.  While some of the Vietcong are
 dedicated and ruthless and good at guerrilla
 warfare, this is not the universal truth.
 For instance, many at the front said the
 Vietcong were poor shots and the State De-
 partment's                                                                             recent  White Paper  cited the
 many Vietcong defections.
 Conversely, there are many examples of
 brave and able military actions by the South
 Vietnamese.         The United States is amassing
 experience in fighting guerrilla-style and it
 has total air and naval superiority.
 RATIO
 On the ground, the ratio of Vietcong killed
 to the freedom forces is still in the nature of
 3 to 1 in our favor.
 The war has not yet been won, but it is
 far from being lost and on balance this cor-
 respondent  believes we  have  the  edge,  a
 condition which should improve in  the
 months to comeespecially with restrictions
 being removed on bombing raids into North
 Vietnam.
 Thesis
 The United States is conducting its war
 on a unilateral basis, whereas it would be
 better if the United Nations were brought
 into the struggle, as it was in Korea.
 Comment
 This would be fine-but there is no chance
 for  another  Korea-type  war  being waged
 by the U.N.
 That conflict was allowed only because the
 Soviet Union, to its later sorrow, had boy-
 cotted the Security Council at the time.  The
 peacekeeping operations of the U.N. in the
 Congo and elsewhere have been less than
 successful.  Considering the present state of
 relations between the Communists and free
 world and the disagreement over the Viet-
 namese situation, U.N. effective action is Im-
 possible.
 As to the unilateral charge, the United
 States is in Vietnam with the approval of
 certain other nations In southeast Asia and
 elsewhere.
 Thesis
 Increasing  boldness  by  the  U.S.  units,
 bombing missions, and its positive refusal
 to negotiate may escalate the war.
 Comment
 Possible, but not probable.
 President John F. Kennedy's firm stand
 on Soviet missiles in Cuba did not lead to war
 there, nor did the earlier firmness of a previ-
 ous  administration  in  defying  the  Berlin
 blockade with an airlift.
 The Korean resistance did escalate that
 war in the sense that it brought Red Chinese
 troops into the battle. However, it is con-
 sidered unlikely the Soviet Union will risk
 nuclear war over a southeast Asia conflict,
 and Hanoi is said not to want the Chinese
 troops in their territory for fear they would
 never leave.
 In any event, certain risks must be taken
 in an effort to have to stop Communist ex-
 pansion in Asia, rather than have to fight
 eventually in Manila, Hawaii, and perhaps
 even the Western Hemisphere.
 SUMMARY
 It is this correspondent's personal opinion
 that the U.S. conduct of the war In South
 Vietnam is proper and effective and that, at
 this time, talks would only damage our just
 cause there.

 HON. JAMES A. BURKE
 OF MASSACHUSETTS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, March 15, 1965
 Mr. BURKE.  Mr. Speaker, the March
 12 edition of the Catholic Standard,
 Washington's Archdiocesan newspaper,
 carried an editorial on the events in
 Selma, Ala? which occurred on March 7,
 1965.  Under unanimous consent I wish
 to include this article in the CONGRES-
 SIONAL RECORD.
 SAD DAY FOR AMERICA
 The police action against the civil rights
 marchers in Selma, Ala., last Sunday has
 painted a sad and sickening scene in the
 pages  of                                 American  history.   Millions  of
 Americans have viewed with horror the pic-
 ture of helmeted policemen beating defense-
 less Negroes with sticks and whips.                                                                                                                                                                           What
 were the Negroes doing?                                 They were commit-
 ting the severe crime of traveling to the State
 capital to petition peacefully the Governor
 for their right to vote.
 No justification can be found for the
 brutal police  actions.   The  Negroes were
 seeking the right to vote-a right which
 though guaranteed by the Constitution, has
 been traditionally denied them in Alabama,
 They were not blocking or even crowding the
 highway on which they were walking.  Their
 march was in no way a "clear and present
 danger" to the citizens of Alabama.  This
 was no disorderly and wild mob.   It was a
 good, orderly group going to ask for the right
 which most Americans take for granted.
 Speaker of the House JOHN W. MCCORMACK
 has called the police action "a disgraceful
 exercise  of  arbitrary power."   We  agree
 wholeheartedly with the Speaker.  The po-
 lice action has done nothing but bring shame
 to Alabama and the man who ordered the
 police action, Gov. George Wallace.
 . The police action in Selma affects every
 American not only because of the brutality
 toward fellow American citizens, which is
 of great consequence to all.  Such an action

 President's Johnson's Actions in Vietnam
 Speak Louder Than Words
 North Vietnam until Hanoi calls off the ag-
 gression.  This  decision  has  been  firmly
 made.  Its execution is its best announce-
 ment.
 Diplomatically, the United States is pre-
 pared to go to the conference table the
 minute the Communists cease their aggres-
 sion, but there will be no negotiation as
 long as aggression continues.
 We seek no territory, no bases, no perma-
 nent military establishment in South Viet-
 nam.  But we know from experience that a
 paper agreement guaranteeing the independ-
 ence of South Vietnam is,not self-enforcing.
 Such an agreement was signed in 1954-and
 torn up by North Vietnam.  An American
 presence in southeast Asia will be maintained
 so that the United States can join in guard-
 ing against future aggression.
 Because this no-yield policy was slow in
 coming, it is understandable that many
 Americans-and  the  Asian  Communists,
 too-were uncertain  that  the President
 really meant it.
 The President has made his decision-to
 raise  the controlled military pressure  on
 North Vietnam steadily until it achieves its
 end.
 This policy is visible in Vietnam-North
 and South.  There can be no turning back.
 It is visible in the air raids over North Viet-
 nam-and there will be more.                                                                            It is visible

 Sam Geddes: A Man of the People
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 or         -
 HON. DON H. CLAUSEN
 OF CALIFORNIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, March 15, 1965
 Mr. DON H. CLAUSEN.  Mr. Speaker,
 the people of California have lost arrout-
 standing State legislator.             Samuel R.
 Geddes, State senator from Napa, died
 in his home on March 5. He was 65.
 Sam will best be remember for his
 tenacity and courage in dealing with the
 State's monumental water problems as
 well as his attempt to help stay the Su-
 premeCourt's decision on reapportion-
 ment.  Until the very day of his death,
 Sam was one of the most outspoken
 advocates of a constitutional amendment
 permitting States to apportion one house
 of their legislature on a basis other than
 population.  We held many sessions in
 my Washington office discussing the af-
 fect on Napa and the State of California.
 His advice and counsel were of immeasur-
 able value as we developed legislative
 strategy to oppose the Supreme Court's
 decision in reapportionment.
 To these critics, the senator would reply,
 "Well, I don't just represent Democrats in
 Sacramento, I represent all the people."
 Mr. Geddes had literally thousands of
 friends,  it was not at all uncommon for
 people to shout "H1, Sam," as he would walk
 down the street or attend a public meeting.
 Last year, as he  attended the  opening
 session of the Yolo County Fair, he was in-
 troduced  at  a  small dinner  at  the fair-
 grounds, and an official said, "This fair just
 wouldn't be the same Without Sam Geddes'
 presence."
 The senator enjoyed being with people.
 At times he maintained a schedule which
 would have stopped many men a good many
 years younger.  It was not uncommon for
 Mr Geddes to attend two or three public
 functions a night.  Once when asked why
 he maintained such a heated schedule, he
 replied, with a smile, "Because I enjoy it
 and I like people."
 Sam Geddes was ever aware of the public
 pulse.  He made every effort to represent the
 wishes  of  the  people, in  the  legislature.
 He had a deep desire to aid the cause of
 senior citizens. He favored the cause for
 greater recreational facilities for all Cali-
 fornians.                                                                       He was a constant fighter for
 economy in State government and recently
 pledged to battle against increased taxes.
 But, most of all, Sam Geddes was a man of
 the people.  He gave his all in the name of
 public service.  He -was  highly respected.
 He was beloved by many.   The deeds of Sam
 Geddes, and Sam Geddes as a warm individ-
 ual, will long be remembered.

 Worthy Program
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 It was my good fortune to work very
 closely with Senator Sam on many prob-
 lems of mutual concern to our beloved
 Napa County.  The meeting we jointly
 held to hear from the people of Napa on
 their water problems was highly produc-
 tive and will in by judgment be recog-
 nized in the future as one of the most
 constructive held in many years.  The
 interest Senator Geddes demonstrated in
 this and' other matters has earned him
 the respect of Republicans and Demo-
 crats alike. He was one of the most non-
 partisan members of the California leg-
 islature-completely objective to needs
 of his people.
 A very fine editorial in the Napa Reg-
 ister expresses the true sentiments of the
 community of Napa.  Senator Sam re-
 tained the uncanny ability of communi-
 catingwith his constituency-an ability
 that consistently reflected the warmth
 and understanding of this great man-
 an ability that has earned him the title
 as included in the following editorial:

 Samuel R. Geddes-known only as Sam.
 to his friends-died last night minutes after
 suffering a heart attack.  The senator suc-
 cumbed at his home, where his beloved wife,
 Loraine, had died about 20 months earlier-
 also from a heart attack,
 Sam Geddes had been elected to his second
 term in the senate last November by the
 largest majority received by anyone seeking
 public office in this area.  Prior to o being
 named to the senate in 1960 he was an
 assemblyman four terms.

 bills, which follow the President's out-
 line.                                                                                         My bill, H.R. 4937, would provide
 for Federal assistance for programs of
 research and experimentation in crime
 prevention and detection, and for the
 training of law enforcement personnel.
 H.R. 4938 would establish a National Ad-
 visory Commission on Interstate Crime,
 and H.J. Res. 321 would provide for a
 White House Conference on Crime Pre-
 vention and Juvenile Delinquency.
 Crime is a national problem, although
 it is the direct responsibility of our local
 and State governments.  The responsi-
 bility extends to all of our citizens, and
 we must do all we can to reverse these
 drastic increases in crime rates.

 or NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, March 15, 1965
 Mr. KEOGH. Mr.  Speaker,  under
 leave to extend my remarks in the REC-
 ORD, I include the following, interesting,
 and well-written article by a distin-
 guished writer, John Herling, and which
 appeared in the Washington Daily News
 of Tuesday, March 9, 1965:

 (By John Herling)
 Maybe it's premature, like just one swallow
 does not make it spring-but hope for com-
 prehensive medical care is now busting out
 all over Washington.  WILBUR MILLS, chair-
 man of the House Ways and Means Commit-
 tee, grinds slowly, also exceedingly fine.  But
 once he really starts to grind, the legislative
 dance goes faster and faster.  He no longer
 cares about what the boys in the backroom
 will have.  He comes out front and center
 and gives the paying customers what they
 want.
 For this week, after nearly a decade of
 waiting, panting, frustrating, swearing, the
 advocates of medical care for older Ameri-
 cans are about to get themselves a bill.  For
 about that many years the bump of reluc-
 tance was centered in WILBUR MILLS, the gen-
 tleman from Arkansas, perhaps-next to the
 Speaker of the House of Representatives--
 the most powerful legislator in the United
 States.  If  WiLBUe  was not willin', a bill

 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, March 15, 1965
 Mr.  BENNETT.  Mr.  Speaker,  all
 Americans should be aware of the an-
 nouncement Tuesday by J. Edgar Hoover
 that the serious crime rate in the United
 States increased 13 percent in 1964 over
 1963.
 This is compared to an increase of 10
 percent over the previous year, accord-
 ing to the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
 tion.  It means an increase of more than
 250,000 serious offenses last year, includ-
 ing murder, up 9 percent; forcible rape,
 up 19 percent; aggravated assault, up 18
 percent, and robbery, up 12 percent.
 These are shocking figures, and need
