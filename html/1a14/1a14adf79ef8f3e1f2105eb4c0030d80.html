 ANGOLA: AFTER THE DELUGE
 After more than six months of civil war, the
 Popular Movement has gained unchallenged mil-
 itary control over the largest and richest of
 Portugal's former African territories. Its rivals con-
 ceded defeat in conventional combat and
 retreated from the field-the National Front into
 Zaire and the National Union into a remote area
 of southern Angola. The countries that provided
 the main support for the Popular Movement's
 rivals-Zaire and South Africa-are seeking to
 make their own peace with the Movement's
 leader, Agostinho Neto. His government in Luan-
 da now faces the complex task of consolidating
 political control over a traumatized population of
 more than 6 million people and of reconstructing
 a once-thriving economy that has been shattered
 by the fighting.
 During the past week, the Soviet-equipped
 Popular Movement and Cuban forces largely
 completed their occupation of the country's ma-
 jor towns and the route in Angola of the vital
 Benguela Railroad. They encountered little op-
 position from their defeated foes, who melted
 away. For now, however, the victors appear to
 have stopped their advance well short of the
 positions just inside the southern Angolan border
 occupied by some 4,000-5,000 South African
 troops who are guarding the frontier and protec-
 ting the important Cunene hydroelectric project.
 National Union president Jonas Savimbi is still
 vowing to wage guerrilla warfare indefinitely. He
 has established a headquarters at Gago Coutinho,
 in southeastern Angola. Some of his forces have
 occcupied Calai, near the Namibian border, and
 plan to turn it into a major resupply base.
 Savimbi's chances of mounting a serious in-
 surgency against the Popular Movement appear
 dim, however. South Africa, his major backer, is
 more interested in trying to secure a stable
 Namibian-Angolan border than in harassing the
 Popular Movement and is exploring the possibili-
 ty of reaching an accommodation with the Neto
 regime. Such a possibility was given a boost last
 week when Neto's foreign minister stated that his
 government "would be prepared to cooperate"
 with Pretoria provided it recognizes the Popular
 Movement's sovereignty over Angola. Pretoria
 quickly announced that it was studying the state-
 ment.
 The Luanda government has already begun
 to tighten its administrative grip over Angola's
 major urban and economic centers. Officials of
 the Popular Movement, which has always been an
 urban-based organization, relate easily with

 workers and intellectuals. For the time being, at
 least, the Movement probably will leave the rural
 population to fend for itself, much as Portugal
 did.
 Economically, the new regime's first tasks will
 be to restore the flow of traffic along the
 Benguela Railroad and resume oil production in
 the enclave of Cabinda, which was suspended by
 Gulf Oil in late December. It will probably rely
 heavily on Cuban technicians to operate rail and
 port facilities. The Popular Movement has
 authorized Nigeria to negotiate on its behalf with
 Gulf for the payment of taxes and royalties owed
 Angola for production since independence last
 November. Such negotiations will have to be
 worked out to the new regime's satisfaction
 before Gulf is invited to reclaim its concession in
 Cabinda.
 LEBANON: SETTLEMENT ANNOUNCED
 President Franjiyah last weekend announced
 political changes that meet most of the demands
 of Lebanon's old-line Muslim leaders, yet
 preserve the most important prerogatives of the
 country's Christian minority. The reforms do not
 include the fundamental political changes sought
 by the Lebanese left, but they do promise the lef-
 tists a variety of more limited political, social, and
 economic gains. The Christians' endorsement of
 the reforms may win Lebanon at least a few
 months of peace.
 In his speech outlining the reform package,
 Franjiyah sought to balance concessions for the
 Muslims with reassurances for the Christians. He
 prol6sed the Muslims that Lebanon's constitution
 will continue to "evolve by experience" to ac-
 commodate needed changes in the political
 system, that the government is committed to
 social justice, and that the country will never
 abandon its "Arab character." At the same time,
 the President assured the Christians that the 1943
 national covenant will be preserved, that the
 Palestinians will be expected to adhere to their
 past agreements with the Lebanese government,
 and that Lebanon will retain its "sovereignty."
 As outlined by Franjiyah, the most important
 points of the package provide for:
 ?  Continuing the existing system of
 distributing the top political posts; the presi-
 dent will be a Maronite Christian, the prime
 minister a Sunni Muslim, and the speaker of
 parliament a Shia Muslim.
 ?  Equal representation for Christians
 and Muslims in parliament and proportional
 representation of sects within each major
 religion.
 ?  Election of the prime minister by
 parliament, instead of his being selected by
 the president.
 ?  Transferring some power from the
 president to the prime minister; all decrees
 and bills will be issued jointly.
 ?  Decentralizing the civil service and
 establishing a merit system.
 ?  Drafting a new defense policy and
 strengthening the army.
 Lebanon's old-line Muslim leaders, especially
 Prime Minister Karami, gain most from the agree-
 ment. Their major victory is in the increased
 power of the prime minister relative to that of the
 president. The traditionally dominant Sunni
 Muslim politicians are not likely to attempt to use
 the greater Muslim representation in parliament
 to make that body significantly more powerful
 than it has been in the past, primarily because the
 reforms, if implemented equitably, would lead to
 increased representation for the disadvantaged
 Shia Muslims and the Lebanese leftists. According
 to press reports, leading Christian and Muslim
 politicians are now considering a plan that would
 delay the reorganization of parliament by exten-

 ding the life of the existing legislature for one or
 two years.
 The Lebanese leftists and radical Muslim
 religious leaders received no satisfaction of their
 fundamental demands: that the Maronite
 Christians give up the presidency and that the
 religious basis of Lebanon's government be aban-
 doned. Nevertheless, they are not likely to try to
 spark new hostilities until they see whether or not
 the government implements promised economic
 and social reforms. I n the near term, at least, some
 of the leftists will be satisfied with limited
 measures; others will be cowed by the
 overwhelming military presence in Lebanon of
 the Syrian-controlled Palestine Liberation Army
 and by the decision of the major fedayeen groups
 to cooperate with the Liberation Army in enfor-
 cing the cease-fire.
 Leaders of the large Christian political parties
 presumably decided that they could accept the
 reform package because it perpetuates Christian
 control of the presidency and-theoretically, at
 least-leaves in force the 30-year-old national
 covenant. Even before endorsing the final version
 of the reforms, the Christians received a reaffir-
 mation of Syria's commitment to guarantee
 Palestinian respect for past agreements limiting
 fedayeen activities in Lebanon.
 The Christians, in theory, will be left with
 much less power to initiate public policy after the
 reforms are implemented because the president
 will be forced to share his authority to issue
 decrees with the prime minister. In practice this
 will not change much; the fragility of Lebanon's
 political system over the past several months has
 already obliged Franjiyah to secure Karami's ap-
 proval before taking any important step. The
 Christians will in any case retain a veto, since the
 president can withhold approval of proposals
 backed by the prime minister. This is likely to
 become important as the Christians attempt to
 restrain the more powerful prime ministers, in-
 cluding the assertive Karami, who will probably
 push for extensive government programs in
 education, health, and housing.

 SOVIETS COMMENT ON FTAI
 Moscow last week broke its public silence on
 recent developments in the French Territory of
 the Afars and Issas (FTAI). Several articles in the
 Soviet central press replayed Mogadiscio's ver-
 sion of the confrontation early this month
 between French forces and Somali border in-
 surgents in the FTAI. Pravda cited a statement by
 the Somali government that claimed the French
 had retaliated for the insurgents'  seizure of a
 French school bus in the FTAI by crossing into
 Somalia and bombarding the northern city of
 Loyado, "causing numerous casualties."
 Pravda also noted Somali President Siad's de-
 mand for the complete withdrawal of French
 forces from the FTAI and the liquidation of all
 military bases there, as well as his call for an
 urgent meeting of the UN Security Council to dis-
 cuss the latest incident. Tass, meanwhile, replayed
 several Western wire service reports that the
 French were dispatching reinforcements to the
 FTAI and three additional warships to the Indian
 Ocean.
 Moscow's press treatment does not commit
 the Soviets to any particular outcome in FTAI, but
 it is nonetheless a clear sign that the Soviets sup-
 port the essentials of Siad's policy toward FTAI.
 The Soviet ambassador in Somalia said as
 much to a US diplomat earlier this month. He im-
 plied that Moscow would support a "liberation
 struggle" in FTAI if the French try to transfer
 power to a government under the control of Ali
 Aref, the present local government leader. The
 Soviet also said that the USSR hoped Paris would
 act in a way that would assure "peace and
 stability" in the African horn-which may boil
 down to giving Siad what he wants.
 One reason for Moscow's public diffidence
 over FTAI is that it wants to avoid an open dispute
 with Paris. The Soviets are also reluctant to take
 any public position that would anger the
 Ethiopians, whom they regard as being on a
 "progressive" course. Moscow is attempting to
 reassure Addis Ababa that Ethiopian access to
 Djibouti will not be affected by what the Soviets
 regard as a "favorable" outcome in the French
 territory.                                        25X1

 MOROCCO-ALGERIA: OASIS SHOOT-OUT
 Fighting flared briefly in the Spanish Sahara
 forces clashed at the oasis near Amgala.
 the Algerians staged a hit-
 and-run attack on a small Moroccan force guard-
 ing Amgala on February 14, killing some 30
 Moroccans and capturing several others. Algiers
 has claimed that only Polisario guerrillas were in-
 volved, but Rabat believes that the attack was
 carried out by Algerian troops cut off several
 weeks ago during the Moroccan sweep into
 northeastern Sahara. The Algerians apparently
 decided to avenge their defeat at Amgala late last
 month before withdrawing across the border.
 On February 15, Rabat announced that King
 Hassan had sent a personal message to Algerian
 President Boumediene, accusing him of again
 breaking promises not to use Algerian troops in
 the Sahara to fight the Moroccans. Hassan
 challenged Boumediene to make known his in-
 tentions about Spanish Sahara by either accepting
 an internationally guaranteed peace or openly
 declaring war on Morocco.
 Algiers still appears determined to avoid any
 all-out confrontation with Morocco in the Sahara,
 although its official denial of any involvement in
 the Amgala attack was equivocal. A government
 statement said only that as of February 16 no
 Algerian army units were present in the Sahara,
 leaving it to the Algerian media to deny specifical-
 ly that Algerians had participated in the attack on
 February 14. The statement reiterated that Algeria
 will continue to support the Front fully in its
 struggle for independence for Spanish Sahara.
 Boumediene remains adamantly opposed to the
 Moroccan-Mauritanian take-over of the disputed
 territory and continues to insist that a referendum
 on self-determination is the only basis for resolv-
 ing the dispute. He reiterated this demand in a
 letter to all nations on February 17 and called
 upon world leaders to help reduce tensions in the
 area.
 Arab League Secretary General Riad this week
 began an attempt to revive the flagging Arab
 mediation effort in the dispute. There has been
 no visible sign of progress from the mission of the
 UN envoy who spent five days in Spanish Sahara
 ed by the small numb er of civilians, especially
 young Saharans, in population centers under
 Moroccan and Mauritanian control. The UN will
 probably try to limit its involvement in the dispute
 to pro forma consideration of the envoy's report.
 At the same time the Moroccans and the
 Algerians were having their dustup, Mauritanian
 troops were recapturing Ain Ben Tily in northern
 Mauritania. The town had fallen to Polisario
 forces in late January when the guerrillas
 attempted to establish a supply corridor exten-
 ding from the Algerian border through the
 Spanish Sahara and Mauritania to the Atlantic
 Ocean. Moroccan and Mauritanian forces now
 occupy all key towns along the major infiltration
 and supply routes in the contested areas.

 Lieutenant General Obasanjo
 NIGERIA: ABORTIVE COUP ATTEMPT
 CIA-RDP79-00927A011300080001-0
 The motives of the plotters remain unclear.
 The statement broadcast by Dimka during his
 brief control of Lagos radio said only that
 Muhammed's  "hypocrisy"  had  been
 "detected"-possibly an allusion to the
 assassinated leader's punishment of others for of-
 ficial corruption while long guilty of such
 following his announcement, the coup leader
 complained of corruption in the top leadership,
 the recent promotions of senior officers, and
 Nigeria's drift to the "left," citing Lagos' support
 for the Angolan Popular Movement as an exam-
 ple.
 Dimka indicated he wanted to restore
 General Gowon, who was deposed by Muhamm-
 ed last year and is living in Britain. This week the
 Nigerian government charged in effect that
 Gowon was a party to Dimka's plot, but there is
 no evidence that this was the case.
 The appointment of Obasanjo was an-
 nounced by the ruling 21-man Supreme Military
 Council on February 14. To replace Obasanjo as
 armed forces chief of staff-the number-two
 position-the council named one of its more
 junior members, Lieutenant Colonel Yar Adua;
 he was also jumped two ranks to brigadier. The
 elevation of Yar Adua, a member of a prominent
 Hausa family, was reportedly a deliberate attempt

 tends to preserve a regional and tribal balance.
 Obasanjo, for his part, will almost certainly avoid
 any suggestion of tribal favoritism.
 There are indications, however, that
 Muhammed's death and Obasanjo's succession
 have sparked restiveness among northerners.
 Some traditional leaders in the north reportedly
 are expressing the view that Muhammed's
 assassination shows that Christians intend to
 eliminate Muslims from high places. In an attempt
 to calm Muslim concern, the government stated
 publicly on February 18 that the coup had neither
 tribal or religious motivations and that Obasanjo
 had also been marked for assassination. Privately,

 Tribal and religious tensions, generally absent
 from the Nigerian scene in recent years, appear to
 have been rekindled by the assassination of the
 head of state, Murtala Muhammed, a northern
 Hausa tribesman, during an unsuccessful coup
 attempt on February 13. So far, surviving members
 of the military government that took power last
 July seem united and in control of the situation
 and working to defuse tensions. No immediate
 changes in Nigerian foreign policy or relations
 with the US are expected under Nigeria's new
 leader, Lieutenant General Olusegun Obasanjo, a
 Christian and member of the Yoruba tribe of
 southern Nigeria.
 Loyal troops in Lagos easily crushed the coup
 attempt made by a group of middle-level officers
 led by Lieutenant Colonel Dimka, a Christian and
 staff officer at the Ministry of Defense. The coup
 was poorly organized, and support for the rebels
 was limited to a few units in Lagos and in Kwara
 state, where the military governor was murdered.
 Dimka managed to escape, however, and is still at
 large.

 SYRIA: OIL PRODUCTION RECOVERS
 Syrian oil production has fully recovered
 from the effects of the October 1973 war.
 Production and refining capacity are expan-
 ding rapidly, and the country is emerging as an
 oil exporter.
 Crude oil production reached 190,000
 barrels per day in 1975, up 50 percent from the
 prewar level. While most Syrian crude is of
 poor quality and high in sulfur content, new
 fields are yielding higher quality oil. Crude
 from the newly developed Jibse Field, for ex-
 ample, is low in sulfur content. All Syrian
 production is exported, mostly to Italy,
 Romania, and West Germany, at an average
 price of about $9.50 per barrel Total sales in
 1975 reached about $650 million, more than
 two thirds of total Syrian exports. Syria refines
 Iraqi crude for most of its own requirements,
 now estimated at 70,000 barrels per day.
 Petroleum facilities have been repaired,
 and substantial new -construction is evident
 throughout the country. A new refinery at
 Baniyas, being built with Romanian help, will
 triple Syria's crude oil refining capacity. The
 suggested that Nigeria should consider using oil
 as a lever in pursuit of its objectives.
 The abortive coup has spawned widespread
 rumors of foreign involvement, especially by the
 US because of differences over Angola. During
 the week, Nigerian students demonstrated against
 the US embassy in Lagos and other US posts as
 well as against the British chancery. The Nigerian
 government has made no official accusations
 against either Washington or London. Despite
 differences with the US over Angola, the
 government-controlled radio has been
 highlighting the recent signing of a major
 telecommunications contract with a US firm.
 Romanians are reportedly seeking subcontrac-
 ting bids from US and other Western
 petroleum and engineering firms.
 With reserves estimated at more than 2.8
 billion barrels, Syrian production could be sub-
 stantially increased. To develop these
 resources, Syria has begun to turn to Western
 firms. Damascus is dissatisfied with the pace of
 seismic work being done by Hungarian and
 Soviet technicians and with the quality of
 Romanian and Soviet drilling and production
 equipment.  A number of contracts for ex-
 ploration have been signed with US firms.
 The Asad government has tried to assure
 US investors that their interests would be
 protected in the event of another war. Most
 companies nonetheless are reluctant to go
 much beyond making seismic studies and
 providing oil field equipment. Damascus itself
 has taken a cautious approach in contract talks,
 undoubtedly reflecting uneasiness about large
 joint ventures that would give Western firms a
 solid stake in the economy.

 IRAQ: DIVERSIFYING ARMS PURCHASES
 Iraq is using some of its greatly increased oil
 revenues to increase its purchases of arms from
 non-Communist sources. Baghdad is trying to
 reduce its dependence on Soviet arms because it
 fears that Moscow might use arms as a political
 weapon against Iraq as it did Egypt. Nevertheless,
 Iraq is likely to continue to buy most of its ad-
 vanced weapons from the USSR for some time to
 come.
 Iraq ordered $1.7-billion worth of arms dur-
 ing the past two years. About half, mostly am-
 munition and support equipment, came from the
 West and Yugoslavia.  Until 1974, Western
 suppliers had sold only about $5-million worth of
 arms annually to Iraq.
 France is providing almost $500-million worth
 of modern arms including Super Frelon and
 Alouette helicopters, some armored vehicles, and
 the Milan and Harpon antitank missile systems.
 Italy, the second largest West European supplier,
 contracted to deliver $40-million worth of military
 and transportation aircraft and howitzers. Orders
 were placed in Belgium for large amounts of am-
 munition and communications equipment, in the
 UK for Leyland vehicles, and in Spain for 106-mm.
 recoilless rifles. Even India agreed to provide
 about $35 million worth of aircraft ammunition,
 rockets, and napalm. Most of the larger pieces of
 ground equipment and aircraft are yet to be
 delivered.
 Iraq purchased nearly $200-million worth of
 equipment from Yugoslavia, mainly mortars, ar-
 tillery, ammunition, gas masks, and military sup-
 port equipment. Major deliveries from Eastern
 Europe included Czech L-39 jet trainers--the first
 to a non - Warsaw Pact country-some older L-29
 jet trainers, and Czech and Hungarian armored
 vehicles and artillery.
 Under arms agreements signed with the
 Soviets since 1973, Baghdad has received MIG-23
 jet fighters, the SA-6 surface-to-air missile system,
 OSA II and ZHUK patrol boats, Yevgenia-class
 minesweepers, 180-mm. field guns, and the
 FROG-7 tactical surface-to-surface rockets. Iraq
 became the third country in the Middle
 East-after Egypt and Syria-to get the SCUD sur-
 face-to-surface missile system. Moscow also rein-
 troduced the SA-2 surface-to-air missile system,
 which had been delivered in the early 1960s but

 was transferred to Egypt because Iraq did not
 have the technical capability to operate it.
 Until recently Moscow sold Iraq arms at low
 prices on favorable credit terms. Discounts of one
 third from list price often were allowed for
 weapons systems, and repayments ranged from
 five to ten years, at 2 to 2.5 percent interest. Since
 1973, the Soviets may have raised their list prices,
 dropped discounts, and hardened their repay-

 KUWAIT: LOANS TO THE THIRD WORLD
 Bilateral Kuwaiti loans to and investments in
 the Third World totaled about $1.1 billion at the
 end of 1975, up from only $100 million at the end
 of 1974. More than 90 percent went to Arab coun-
 tries. About 95 percent was made at market rates,
 with concessionary loans accounting for the
 remainder.
 Last year, the Ministry of Finance provided
 loans totaling $835 million to Egypt for financing
 balance-of-payments deficits and development
 projects and to Sudan for asugar refinery. In addi-
 tion, more than $100 million was provided to
 governmental bodies in Sudan, Zaire, Mexico,
 and Brazil through one of the Kuwaiti quasi-
 public investment institutions. All these loans
 have repayment periods ranging from 5 to 10
 years at commercial interest rates.
 Kuwaiti investment companies have set up
 several foreign joint ventures for specialized in-
 vestment. The Arab-Brazil Investment Company,
 capitalized at $300 million, is the largest of these
 joint venture companies. Smaller ones have been
 formed in Egypt, Pakistan, Sudan, Senegal, Mali,
 Mauritania, and Mexico. The newest joint ven-
 ture-the Pacific Financial Company, which has
 Japanese, Canadian, and British investment house
 participation-is  looking to channel  Kuwaiti
 money into promising private projects in the Far
 East.
 So far, the new investment institutions have
 done little more than carry out feasibility studies
 and furnish capital for local investment banks.
 About $9 million has been funneled through joint
 ventures. The Kuwaitis have also purchased
 several small commercial properties in the Third
 World.
 In 1975, the Kuwaiti Fund for Arab Economic
 Development disbursed $75 million to eight
 third-world countries at concessionary rates.
 Repayments were extended over 15 or more
 years, starting after a few years' grace period at 3-
 to 4-percent interest rates. This totally
 Kuwaiti-owned development fund was establish-
 ed in 1961 to provide low-interest loans exclusive-
 ly to Arab countries. In July 1974, its charter was
 broadened to cover loans to all developing coun-
 tries. Priority is given to projects in such general
 public sectors as power, transportation, and
 irrigation. The major recipients have been
 Bahrain, Egypt, Morocco, Sudan, and North and
 South Yemen.
 Kuwait is anxious to find more investment
 outlets in the Third World but is having problems
 identifying viable private projects. Kuwaiti finan-
 cial involvement will continue to be inhibited by
 red tape, a questionable political environment,
 stringent investment laws, and the bleak
 short-term economic outlook for most develop-
 ing countries.
 Kuwaiti commercial loans and investments in
 the Third World this year will continue at about
 the 1975 level. Kuwait is committed to $900
 million in third-world projects. We expect a
 decline in Ministry of Finance loans to be offset
 by placements through the joint venture com-    25X1
 panies. Drawings against the outstanding con-
 cessionary loans are expected to increase as work
 on  projects picks up momentum.

 USSR: THE 25th PARTY CONGRESS
 The 25th Party Congress, which opens Tues-
 day, is expected to reconfirm General Secretary
 Brezhnev and the core of leaders around him and
 to reaffirm the basic outlines of their present
 policies. Shifts among second-echelon leaders, as
 well as some innovations in domestic programs,
 are possible. They could offer some clues as to
 how policy and the succession problem may
 develop in the post-congress period.
 Brezhnev appears secure and determined to
 continue in office. The policy disappointments at
 home and abroad over the past 18 months have
 not seriously damaged his status. His health and
 stamina have stabilized in recent months, and he
 is able to function effectively, albeit at a reduced
 pace. Rumor and speculation-some from Soviet
 officials-that Brezhnev would soon retire have
 abated. At the republic congresses, Brezhnev was
 accorded a full portion of praise and honor.
 Major changes in the rest of the leadership
 are also unlikely. The extremely small turnover of
 officials with Central Committee status who have
 been elected at the lower party meetings
 preceding the congress suggests continued
 stability at the top.
 The leadership is likely to make some ad-
 justments in its membership at the secondary
 level. RSFSR Premier Solomentsev and Leningrad
 party boss Romanov are among leaders who have
 some claim to promotion to full membership on
 the Politburo. Departures are also possible. Arvid
 Pelshe, 77 and not influential, may retire
 honorably. The  leadership has avoided
 recriminations over the harvest disaster, but it still
 may offer up someone-perhaps Agricultural
 Minister Polyansky-as a scapegoat.
 If a top leader should go, Premier Kosygin
 seems to be the most likely. Periodically, reports
 have circulated that he would like to retire. His
 health has been indifferent recently. Over the
 years his governmental apparatus has suffered at-
 tacks and incursions from the party, including
 Brezhnev, and reports of criticism cropped up
 again in December. Moreover, Kosygin is the only
 top leader who has an obvious successor, First
 Deputy Premier Mazurov. Even so, his departure
 is only a possibility, not a probability.
 The congress will reaffirm the basic foreign
 and domestic policies pursued by the leadership
 since the last meeting. In his report, however,
 Brezhnev will have to take into account some
 policy disappointments. Last year's bad harvest
 will force him to take a more sober line on
 domestic prospects than on the international out-
 look.
 The fundamentals of Soviet foreign policy are
 not seriously in question, and the overall tone as
 well as the specifics of Brezhnev's report to the
 congress will convey satisfaction and optimism.
 This will be attributed in the first instance to the
 growth of the USSR's military capabilities and the
 increased respect which must consequently be
 accorded Soviet demands throughout the world.
 Brezhnev will find good things to say about
 disarmament. Clearly a SALT II agreement would
 have been a big help, but Brezhnev will still be
 able to point with pride to SALT I and the other
 agreements reached with the US in 1972. He will
 come out for a new SALT agreement and may put
 in a word in favor of future reductions, while
 repeating his call for the banning of new weapons
 of mass destruction. Brezhnev will probably note
 that the MBFR negotiations were begun since the
 24th congress and call for more rapid progress in
 those talks.
 The treatment of the US relationship will
 probably be relatively sober. The problems of
 SALT II, most-favored-nation status, credits, and
 Angola have helped create an atmosphere that
 would make it very difficult for the General
 Secretary, even if he were so inclined, to give a
 strongly positive cast to the US relationship. He
 will note the increasing activity of "anti-detente
 forces" in the US. At the same time, Brezhnev will

 want to signal-particularly in a US election
 year-that Soviet policy aims at placing detente
 with the US back on track.
 Brezhnev will probably be positive on the
 USSR's progress vis-a-vis Western Europe,
 although recent disappointments will give this
 part of his report a more subdued tone than
 would have been the case a year ago.
 China may be a problem. In the past week or
 so, Moscow has been unusually harsh in its treat-
 ment of Peking; this could be a warm-up for a
 blast at the congress. At the 24th congress,
 Brezhnev treated China with remarkable
 forebearance. One argument in favor of such an
 approach this year is the recent leadership
 changes in Peking. The Soviets are not optimistic,
 but they might strike a moderate pose so as either
 to encourage "pro-Soviet" elements in China or,
 at least, to avoid giving additional ammunition to
 Moscow's enemies there.
 Brezhnev will probably emphasize Moscow's
 support for the "struggle against imperialism"
 and for national liberation movements. Com-
 munist successes in Vietnam and Angola will be
 prominent, not only because they are
 "successes," but because Brezhnev will be seek-
 ing to underline the point that detente has not
 prevented the Soviet Union from carrying out its
 international obligations within the Communist
 movement.
 The Economy
 Most of Brezhnev's ambitious plans to put his
 stamp on the country's future at this congress will
 come to naught. A long-term economic plan
 (1976-90) and a new constitution, which he had
 promised for this congress, are evidently far from
 ready. His rather vague calls for a comprehensive
 rationalization of agricultural and industrial
 management have generated little response.
 The leadership will try to gloss over present
 economic difficulties and to retain the verbal
 commitment to a consumer program that has, for
 the time being, lost much of its substance. Quality
 and efficiency will be stressed over quantitative
 growth. Besides calling for more discipline and

 socialist competition, Brezhnev may be tempted
 to launch proposals for some modest reorganiza-

 create a more convincing image of initiative in
 these areas.
 In the ideological sphere, he will convey the
 message that detente and the CSCE agreements
 do not mean a slackening of the ideological
 struggle or of internal discipline.
 The Succession Problem
 Although Brezhnev will remain at the helm,
 the congress proceedings may give some indica-
 tion that the leadership is beginning to address
 the problem of succession. Brezhnev has so far
 made no move to establish a long-term successor,
 and most present candidates lack a good claim to
 his mantle. Shifts among junior leaders-for ex-
 ample, enhancing party secretary Kulakov's status
 or bringing Ukrainian party chief Shcherbitsky to
 Moscow-could signal that succession maneuver-
 ing has begun and suggest who might be a front-
 POLAND: CONSTITUTIONAL GIVE AND TAKE
 The Polish parliament last week approved
 amendments to the country's 1952 constitution
 that bring the document more into line with the
 East European pattern. Public discussion of the
 amendments again showed both the political
 strength of the Polish Catholic Church and certain
 intellectuals and the regime's flexibility and
 willingness to seek compromise rather than con-
 frontation with its critics.
 The amendments were first unveiled last
 September, and in the ensuing months a debate,
 often heated, developed over several of the
 proposals. Numerous petitions were circulated
 among intellectuals and then sent to party and
 state leaders. Stefan Cardinal Wyszynski devoted
 three sermons to the amendments, and church
 officials lobbied hard behind the scenes.
 The regime backed away from some of the
 more politically sensitive formulations, but held
 firm on the need for several basic changes. The
 revised constitution thus, now declares Poland to
 be a "socialist state" rather than merely a people's
 democracy, but the country will continue to be
 known as the Polish People's Republic.
 Elsewhere, the constitution breaks new ground
 by citing the party as the "leading political force"
 in Polish society. The church insisted on adding
 the word "political" to avoid giving the impres-
 sion that the party is the leading force in all sec-
 tors of life. Compromise language also softened
 the linkage between a citizen's rights and duties
 as well as Poland's relationship with the "socialist
 commonwealth." Moreover, the regime agreed
 to delete a clause that would have made "misuse"
 of religious freedom a criminal offense.
 This remarkable process of give-and-take
 shows that the Gierek leadership as well as its
 critics know their respective strengths and
 weaknesses. Polish church officials have indicated
 their grudging willingness to accept the changes,
 thereby implicitly acknowledging that the regime
 holds the levers of power to ram any change it
 wants through the parliament. Continuing pop-
 ular tensions brought on by economic conditions,
 particularly the specter of price hikes for food and
 shortages of consumer goods, also undoubtedly
 contributed to the leadership's willingness to
 compromise. Gierek is keenly aware that a con-
 frontation with the church and intellectuals
 would deflect attention from critical economic
 tasks.
 During the course of the nationwide debate,
 the government's critics were divided into those
 willing to reach a compromise and those who,
 "on principle," opposed all the changes. Now
 that the amendments have been adopted,
 however, the regime may decide to be less gentle
 should the more radical opponents misinterpret
 the compromises as weakness and try to harass it

 USSR-CHINA
 I Z_
 Soviets Approve of Hua
 The Soviet media have reacted favorably to
 the appointment of Hua Kuo-feng, whom they
 term a "moderate," as China's acting premier. A
 Soviet embassy official in Peking has commented
 that one point in Hua's favor is that he has no
 specific history of "anti-Sovietism."
 Moscow's coverage of the new wall poster
 campaign in Peking suggests dismay over the
 ijparent show of leftist strength. Although not
 Hua Kuo-feng
 U Pi
 mentioning Vice Premier Teng by name, one
 broadcast noted that the new campaign seemed
 to be aimed at rehabilitated cadre without whom
 China's economy and administration could not
 function. The Soviets do not like Teng or the lef-
 tists, but Teng, in contrast to the leftists, is at least
 a known quantity and an adversary who the
 Soviets believe appreciates the power balance
 between China and the USSR.
 Despite reservations about what is now
 happening in China, the Soviets still seem inclin-
 ed to see a brighter side for them. A commentary
 in Pravda last week referred to Hua's promotion
 as a sign that the Chinese "moderates," despite
 the fulminations of the leftist-controlled
 propaganda organs, are "gaining currency." The
 same commentary also explicitly referred to
 "representatives" of the Chinese military es-
 tablishment who were linked to the moderates.
 Moscow seems especially sensitive about its
 image vis-a-vis China now that the party congress
 is close at hand. Three times in recent weeks the
 Soviets have denied the implication of a Chinese
 broadcast in early February that there had been
 trouble along the Sino-Soviet border opposite
 China's Sinkiang Province. Tass labeled the
 broadcast a lie from beginning to end.
 The Soviet denials were doubtless aimed at
 several audiences. For the Soviet public, it was in-
 tended to reassure. The denial came only three
 days after Soviet television carried a rare
 documentary on China that played up the
 allegedly militaristic nature of Mao's domestic
 and foreign policies. For the West, the denial was
 aimed at heading off speculation that the
 Sino-Soviet dispute is intensifying or that Moscow
 is putting pressure on China during the succes-
 sion period. For the Chinese, the message seemed
 to be that the Soviets will not abet those in China
 who want to exaggerate the Soviet threat for their
 own political purposes. All the denials noted that
 the Chinese propagandists have in the past
 resorted to these kinds of "concoctions" when
 there was political turmoil in Peking.

 UK: TORIES ON THE OFFENSIVE
 The Labor government faces the prospect of
 more aggressive opposition by the Tories, who
 seem ready to challenge the government
 vigorously on a number of issues during the
 current session of Parliament.
 Until recently, Labor usually won key con-
 tests because the Tory leadership hesitated to at-
 tack the government on anything but a rhetorical
 level. Last week, however, the Tories pulled out
 all stops and produced an almost complete turn-
 out of Conservative MPs in an attempt to defeat
 the government on a controversial trade union
 bill. The Tories even brought back their European
 Parliament representatives from Strasbourg.
 Despite this more aggressive behavior, Labor
 handily turned back the Conservatives' first
 all-out parliamentary maneuver in over a year.
 The effort failed, even though the Conservatives
 were joined on four separate votes by an assort-
 ment of Liberals, Ulster Unionists, and Scottish
 Nationalists, because Labor's factions closed ranks
 to support the government. The only defections
 were two Laborites currently under criminal in-
 dictment, one of whom has voluntarily dis-
 qualified himself from parliamentary activities un-
 til his legal problems have ended.
 SOYUZ-20 ENDS 91-DAY MISSION
 The unmanned Soyuz-20 spacecraft
 separated from the Salyut-4 space station on
 Monday and returned to the USSR after 91 days
 in orbit. This mission was very likely a prelude
 to the launch of a manned spacecraft that will
 probably attempt to establish a new record for
 manned space flights.
 Soyuz-20 was launched on November 17
 and docked with the space station two days
 later. There is no indication that new systems or
 operational techniques were tested, but the
 Soviets have announced that biological ex-
 periments with different plants and living
 organisms were conducted. The spacecraft was
 pressurized to sea level conditions indicating
 The Tories had more luck later in the week as
 Labor floor managers in Commons let down their
 guard. As a result, the government suffered
 harmless, but embarrassing, defeats on two
 relatively insignificant bills.
 While the Conservative victories were a
 fluke, the cumulative effect of last week's
 aggressive opposition performance was an impor-
 tant psychological victory for the Tories. They
 probably did not expect to topple Wilson, but
 their effort served to reinforce Margaret
 Thatcher's leadership with the party rank and file,
 who have probably felt somewhat uneasy about
 the lackluster performance of Tory MPs
 throughout most of 1975.
 The Conservatives will continue to assert
 themselves in the months ahead, but barring
 massive defections from the Labor left, the op-
 position is not likely to be able to defeat the
 Wilson government on any major issues. Tory
 successes on minor legislative matters, however,
 serve as a warning to Labor leaders to be alert to
 an opposition that will continue to seek oppor-
 tunities to embarrass the government, which has
 only a one seat majority in Parliament.
 that one of the mission's objectives was to test
 life support systems for a lengthy manned mis-
 sion. The longest Soviet manned space mission
 to date was conducted last year when the
 Soyuz-18 crew remained in orbit for 63 days.
 No major problems developed during the
 flight.
 In view of the apparent success of the
 Soyuz-20 mission, the Soviets, after
 replenishing or replacing the Salyut-4 space
 station, will probably attempt to launch a
 manned spacecraft within the next few months.
 That mission will probably last about 90 days
 and thus set a new record for manned space
 flights. The US Skylab-3 crew was in orbit for 84
 days in 1974.

 THE SOVIET PACIFIC FLEET
 The position of the Soviet navy in Far Eastern
 waters has been getting considerable attention
 lately in South Korean and Japanese newspapers.
 The papers were reacting to recent congressional
 testimony by the US Chief of Naval Operations.
 The Soviets are the strongest naval power in
 the Sea of Japan. The USSR's Pacific Ocean fleet
 over the past few years has been strengthened by
 the addition of newer submarines and surface
 ships. It now has about 110-submarines, 60 major
 surface ships, and about 325 naval aircraft, mostly
 based along the Sea of Japan. Much of the Soviet
 naval activity in the Sea of Japan is easily detected
 by the South Koreans and Japanese. Soviet surface
 ships leaving this sea and moving to stations in the
 Pacific and the Indian oceans, for example, must
 pass through straits bounded by Japanese or
 South Korean territory.
 Soviet naval bombers, as well as recon-
 naissance and antisubmarine warfare aircraft, are
 frequently in the air over the Sea of Japan and ad-
 jacent waters. Last September, the Japanese
 Foreign Ministry lodged a protest with Moscow
 over Soviet violations of Japanese airspace. Dur-
 ing their infrequent visits to the Sea of Japan, ma-
 jor US surface ships are kept under nearly cons-
 tant surveillance by the Soviets.
 North Korea's present naval superiority over
 the South makes Seoul sensitive to any apparent
 diminution of US strength in the Sea of Japan. The
 South Korean press has recently pointed out that
 the Korean war ended successfully only because
 the high seas were under US control. The in-
 ference is clear that this might not be the case if
 another war breaks out on the peninsula.
 At least one newspaper offered a remedy,
 urging Seoul to improve its antisubmarine warfare
 capabilities and build a submarine fleet to match
 North Korea's. Seoul is already taking steps to im-
 prove its antisubmarine capabilities. It is relying
 heavily on ship- and shore-based helicopters and
 fixed-wing aircraft. The South Koreans had con-
 sidered acquiring their own attack submarines to
 counter those of the North, but-after discussions
 with senior US officials-chose instead to develop
 air and surface antisubmarine techniques.
 Seoul appears not to have completely aban-    25X1
 doned the idea of acquiring submarines, and the
 recent press stories may be inspired in part to
 keep this option open.
 25X1
 ...and in Japan
 The implications of the Soviet presence in the
 Sea of Japan are not as serious for Tokyo as they
 are for Seoul, but the Japanese, too, are concern-
 ed about the impact of any apparent erosion of
 US military strength in the Far East. Japan's modest

 navy is oriented toward coastal defense, with an-
 tisubmarine warfare a major focus of naval
 operations. The Japanese are modernizing their
 antisubmarine warfare capability, and defense of-
 ficials acknowledge that future defense planning
 may have to include provisions for a greater
 Japanese role in protecting key sea lanes near
 home.
 The current scandal in Tokyo over alleged
 payments to Japanese officials by the Lockheed
 Corporation, however, has delayed the
 goverment's plans for improving its antisub-
 marine warfare forces. Tokyo had decided to
 purchase more than 100 antisubmarine aircraft
 from Lockheed, but the government has an-
 nounced that the decision is now under review.

 HUNGARY: A NEW ARCHBISHOP
 The Vatican's appointment last week of a
 successor to the late Jozsef Cardinal Mindszenty
 as Archbishop of Esztergom will improve its
 relations not only with Hungary but with other
 East European states as well.
 The new Archbishop of Esztergom-tradi-
 tionally the Primate of Hungary-is Laszlo Lekai,
 a 65-year-old bishop who at one time was
 Mindszenty's secretary. Lekai, who will clearly
 never match his mentor's outspoken perform-
 ance, has apparently not been a member of the
 regime-sponsored  "peace  priest"  movement
 and has quietly worked in the lower church
 ranks for most of his career. Budapest un-
 doubtedly hopes that he will provide a model of
 church-state cooperation that will help erase
 the  bitter  anti-communist  legacy  left  by
 Mindszenty. The Vatican, for its part, wants to
 see the church in Hungary strengthened, but
 without controversy or collaborationist over-
 tones.
 Both sides have been cautiously optimistic
 about diplomatic ties, which, if established, would
 be the Vatican's first formal relations with a War-
 saw Pact country. Budapest probably calculates
 that diplomatic relations would provide useful
 evidence of its commitment to the Helsinki sum-
 mit accord and would also be a popular move
 on the domestic front. Party leader Kadar will,
 however, proceed with the measured delibera-
 tion that has marked his foreign policy.
 The Vatican-which has cautiously been
 seeking improved relations with Eastern
 Europe-will probably want to secure other gains
 for the church in Hungary before entering into
 formal relations. The Holy See may also feel that it
 would be politically imprudent to do this at a time
 when the Vatican has stiffened its opposition to
 cooperation between the Communists and other
 parties in Italy.
 The Vatican may deem it more appropriate to
 establish diplomatic relations with Poland first.
 The Polish church is the largest and the most
 powerful in Eastern Europe and Warsaw has es-
 tablished a stronger dialogue with the Holy See
 than has Budapest. Any Polish-Vatican move
 toward formal ties, however, must take into ac-
 count the views of Polish Cardinal Wyszynski,
 who is anxious to preserve his prerogatives as
 primate of Poland and to serve as the conduit for
 any contacts between the Polish government and
 the Vatican.                                     25X1
 UNEMPLOYMENT TO PERSIST ABROAD
 In six of the major developed coun-
 tries-Canada, West Germany, the UK, France,
 Japan, and Italy-economic recovery will
 probably not be sufficient to make sizable inroads
 into unemployment this year or next. Govern-
 ment reluctance to take strong stimulative
 measures-in the face of persistent inflation and
 mounting budget deficits-will likely prevent a
 rapid recovery. In Western Europe, large-scale
 unemployment may well persist into the 1980s,
 but Japan and Canada may experience labor shor-
 tages over the next decade. If this assessment
 proves correct, political pressures on variousWest
 European governments to adopt vigorous
 re-employment measures will mount.
 Taking the six countries as a group, un-
 employment in 1975 affected over 5 million per-
 sons, more than 2 million above the previous
 highs in the 1960s and 1970s. Furthermore, the
 number of persons on short-time work schedules
 multiplied rapidly.
 ?  Canada had the highest unemploy-
 ment rate, some 7 percent of the labor force
 in 1975.
 ?  In West Germany, the 4.2-percent
 rate was five times the average for 1963-73.
 ?  The 3.5-percent rate in Britain ex-
 ceeded peaks of 1972 and 1974 when coal
 strikes severely curtailed employment in the
 winter months.
 ?  The 3.7-percent rate in France ex-
 ceeded by 2 percentage points the rate
 posted in 1968 when economic activity was
 disrupted by riots and demonstrations.

 ?  Japan, even with its tradition of
 lifetime employment, saw unemployment
 rise to 1.9 percent of the labor force;
 joblessness is particularly severe among
 youth and the less educated.
 ?  Italy, through extensive use of
 short-timing, held down unemployment
 rises better than the other three West Euro-
 pean countries; even so, the average 1975
 rate of 3.6 percent was close to the record of
 the past 15 years.
 Given the high level of outright joblessness
 and the large amount of underemployment, a
 return to anywhere near pre-1974 unemployment
 levels is unlikely this year or next. In West Ger-
 many, Britain, and Italy, employment is likely to
 continue to decline this year as firms more fully
 utilize workers already on payrolls. In 1977, these
 countries seem likely to post only slight gains in
 employment at best. If, as seems probable, infla-
 tion accelerates in 1977, governments will in-
 stitute restrictive policies; these will prevent a
 sharp strengthening in recovery or lessen its dura-
 tion. Consequently, unemployment is expected
 to rise in Italy and Britain; it may hold steady in
 West Germany because of an expected exodus of
 300,000 foreign workers this year.
 Some growth in employment is expected in
 the other three countries in 1976 and 1977.
 Canada seems likely to achieve the strongest gain,
 2 percent in each year, while gains in France and
 Japan will be at or below 1 percent per year. Only
 in Japan will employment increases outstrip labor
 force rises.
 The most severe unemployment pressures
 seem likely in West Germany, Britain, and Italy.
 From 1960 through 1975, all three of these coun-
 tries have had almost no change in employment.
 In this period, the labor force did not grow. In the
 next 10 years, however, growth of the
 working-age population will accelerate strongly,
 particularly in 1981-85. The number of young peo-
 ple entering the labor force will remain high, and
 exits from the labor force will decline as the age
 group depleted by World War 11 passes into
 retirement. In France, a less pronounced
 acceleration of working-age population growth,
 combined with a stronger growth trend in
 employment indicates joblessness will be only
 slightly higher than in the decade before the pre-
 sent recession.
 The projected unemployment rates, and par-
 ticularly the high level of unemployment among
 young people, promises trouble for West Euro-
 pean governments and societies. To some extent,
 the working of the labor market will alleviate the
 problem; for example, the recession has already
 led to an exodus of foreign workers, mainly
 Greeks, Spaniards, Yugoslavs, and Turks, from
 West Germany and France. A continuation of this
 exodus would clearly ease the unemployment
 problem in West Germany and France, but it
 would aggravate unemployment and balance-of-
 payments problems in the workers' home coun-
 tries.
 In West Germany, unemployment will be an
 issue in the federal election this October, in part
 because there are few other economic problems.
 Chancellor Schmidt is trying to  defuse un-
 employment as the issue by a job-training
 program designed to benefit 120,000 young Ger-
 mans, an age group hit particularly hard.
 In France, the government, which does not
 face an election until 1978, has concentrated on
 fighting inflation and allowing unemployment to
 rise. While the left has attempted to seize on the
 issue, the workers at large have not yet been will-
 ing to take to the streets. French President Giscard
 is clearly counting on international economic
 recovery to pull up the French economy. It is our
 judgment, however, that even with moderate
 economic recovery, French unemployment may
 remain high throughout this decade.
 In Britain, Prime Minister Wilson has also
 decided to bring rising prices under control
 before taking significant measures to stimulate
 the economy and create jobs. So far, this course
 has not encountered heavy resistance from the
 labor unions because the high level of unemploy-
 ment makes workers cautious. Now however, un-
 ion leaders are beginning to grow restive, and if,
 as could well occur, unemployment shows no
 signs of substantial abatement, the government
 and the unions could clash.

 CHINA: TENG UNDER FIRE
 Teng Hsiao-ping, China's erstwhile successor
 to chou En-lai as premier, has come under inten-
 sified attack since the designation earlier this
 month of Hua Kuo-feng as "acting premier." In
 an apparently coordinated effort, the official
 media and political wall posters, appearing mainly
 in universities, have accused Teng of reversing the
 policies of the Cultural Revolution, forming
 "cliques" around himself, splitting the party cen-
 tral committee, and promoting economic prog-
 ress at the expense of politics.
 These attacks are a reaction to the great
 power Teng accumulated after returning from the
 political exile imposed on him in the Cultural
 Revolution a decade ago. His various detractors
 may have different goals in mind in promoting
 these attacks, and for that reason it is difficult to
 predict what eventually will become of him. Some
 of his opponents undoubtedly want to purge him
 again if only because he represents everything
 they tried to eradicate during the Cultural
 Revolution. Others, who rank just below Teng in
 political standing, may be willing to settle for a
 reduction of his power if some of that power falls
 into their hands. There is also the question of
 policy, and there presumably are differences
 within the leadership over what policies to pursue
 and at what pace.
 Some in the leadership probably recognize
 that Teng's ouster would leave thousands of other
 rehabilitated officials at all levels of the Chinese
 hierarchy vulnerable to similar treatment. Should
 widespread attacks on rehabilitated officials oc-
 cur-and there is evidence that at least two other
 lower level officials are being criticized-the
 result would be political turmoil and perhaps
 even violence throughout the country. For that
 reason alone, some officials may be opposing
 drastic action against Teng. Similar considerations
 may have come into play when another top party
 official came under severe attack in 1974 and was
 eventually demoted from a party vice chairman to
 an ordinary member of the Politburo. The demo-
 tion apparently silenced his critics.
 Although Teng has been denied the
 premiership, he apparently has not yet lost any of
 his party, government, or military positions. The
 Chinese Foreign Ministry has said he remains a
 vice premier in government, and the Ministry of
 Defense has confirmed that he is still chief of staff.
 Most Chinese officials abroad are confident that
 he also retains his high party position. They have
 obviously received no official word that Teng is
 politically finished. In fact, most Chinese officials
 abroad who have offered an opinion on Teng's
 current troubles see the balance of power in the
 leadership as clearly favoring the pragmatists

 associated with Teng. Although they may not
 have access to inside information and may be bas-
 ing their judgment on Teng's strong showing last
 year-and on the fact that many of his supporters
 are now in important posts-it is perhaps signifi-
 cant that they are for the most part optimistic
 about Teng's future and do not expect foreign or
 domestic policy to swing to the left as a result of
 the current situation.
 A large party meeting convened shortly after
 Chou En-lai's death, presumably to choose a new
 premier, apparently broke up early without
 reaching a decision. It was left to the ruling Polit-
 buro to designate an acting premier. The relative-
 ly few appearances by Politburo members in re-
 cent weeks suggest the Politburo may still be
 meeting, with Teng's status likely on the agenda.
 Teng's image has clearly been tarnished by the at-
 tacks on him, but should he survive his current
 troubles, he will still be a force-albeit somewhat
 chastened-to be reckoned with. In that event,
 those who are currently orchestrating the effort
 to oust him may themselves fall on political hard
 times
 THAILAND: ENERGY OUTLOOK
 Government plans for eventually reducing oil
 imports have been set back by failure to find com-
 mercially exploitable quantities of oil in the Gulf
 of Thailand. Further exploration has been
 hindered by the uncertain political environment
 that followed the fall of Indochina. Thailand will
 have to continue relying heavily on imported oil,
 mostly from Middle Eastern suppliers.
 Oil consumption grew 19 percent annually
 during 1965-73 but declined in 1974-75 because of
 sharply higher prices, which the government
 passed on to consumers, and the cessation of In-
 dochinese military operations. We expect oil im-
 ports to grow very slowly over the next five years,
 not rising much beyond the record 151,000 barrels
 per day of 1971
 The Thai government has until recently relied
 mainly on price changes in adjusting to the higher
 costs of imported oil. Prices have been raised on
 petroleum products and electricity to reflect ac-
 tual costs to consumers. Subsidies on diesel and
 other refined products designed to stimulate
 economic development have been eliminated.
 The government has restricted commercial and
 street lighting and has raised taxes on energy-
 consuming appliances. Because of its heavy
 reliance on oil, industry has been particularly
 affected by the higher prices. Industrial produc-
 tion fell off sharply, and the growth of real gross
 national product slowed from 10.3 percent in 1973
 to 3.3 percent in 1974. Oil price rises have also
 been a major factor in Thai inflation and conse-
 quent labor unrest. The latest rise in OPEC prices
 in October 1975 has not been passed on to con-
 sumers for fear of political repercussions before
 the April elections.
 The government has sought to exploit
 available domestic energy sources by converting
 some power plants to lignite, but this saved less
 than 3,000 barrels per day in 1974. An aggressive
 diplomatic search for new oil suppliers has
 resulted in small contracts for Chinese diesel and
 crude. Thailand is currently attempting to obtain
 more oil at favorable prices from neighboring In-
 donesia in order to reduce dependence on Mid-
 dle East oil.
 Thailand is utilizing less than one third of its
 hydroelectric power potential. The government is
 not prepared to provide the massive investment
 in dams and equipment needed to boost capacity
 within the next 3 to 5 years. Nuclear power plants
 are in the planning stage; they will produce less
 than 1 percent of energy requirements when they
 become operative in 1982. Shale oil deposits, es-
 timated to contain 1.8 billion barrels of oil, could
 be developed within 10 years if technology and
 prices make extraction commercially attractive.
 The one bright spot resulting from exploration in
 the Gulf of Thailand was the discovery in 1974 of a
 natural gas deposit in the Gulf estimated at 1
 trillion cubic feet, which could supply 10 percent
 of Thai energy needs by 1985.

 ASEAN: A SUMMIT AT LAST
 After nine years of halting development and
 several false starts toward a summit meeting, the
 Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
 will hold its first summit in Bali next week. The
 agreement of the five leaders from Malaysia,
 Singapore,  Indonesia,  the  Philippines,  and
 Thailand to meet together and to issue a common
 declaration is itself a major achievement con-
 sidering the conflicting national outlooks and the
 personal animosities that exist between some of
 them. The brief history of the association has
 been marked by the frequent indifference of
 some members to the concerns of the others, and
 a common view of regional cooperation has been
 slow in developing.
 Conflicting reactions to the fundamental
 political and security changes that have occurred
 in the region over the past few years constitute
 one general line of division within ASEAN. The
 mainland states of Malaysia and Thailand well
 before the end of the Indochina war began to see
 the value in a more evenly balanced foreign
 policy based on rapprochement with China and,
 if possible, with their Indochinese communist
 neighbors.
 Indonesia, however, has been far more in-
 terested in promoting itself as a natural bulwark
 against further communist expansion in the
 region. Jakarta was unhappy with the decisions by
 Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines to es-
 tablish diplomatic relations with China and has
 adamantly resisted any suggestion that ASEAN's
 doors be opened to the Indochinese states.
 Instead, Jakarta, with little regard to Thai and
 Malaysian sensitivities, has been pressing for
 mutual security understandings within the ASEAN
 framework that would inevitably carry anti-com-
 munist connotations.
 Singapore, with support from the Philippines,
 has been actively promoting increased economic
 ties among the ASEAN nations and has recently
 stepped up efforts to form an ASEAN free trade
 area. Indonesia, the most populous and
 economically backward of the ASEAN states,
 views Singapore's motives as self-serving and
 argues that a tariff-free arrangement would lead
 to Singaporean domination in area markets for a
 wide range of consumer products. Even gradual
 reductions in tariffs for selected commodities are
 likely to be opposed by Jakarta at Bali.
 Ina move to establish a permanent head-
 quarters and secretariat in Jakarta, the members
 have informally agreed to name an Indonesian to
 be the first secretary general.

 ECUADOR: AN INAUSPICIOUS START
 Ecuador's new supreme council of govern-
 ment already appears headed for trouble.
 Minister of Natural Resources Rene Vargas' plan
 to alter the current modus vivendi with the Tex-
 aco-Gulf petroleum consortium is facing the
 government with a potentially disastrous
 problem. Since taking over the ministry on
 January 11, Vargas, under the guise of expanding
 petroleum production and exploration, has been
 trying to raise the price for Ecuadorean crude and
 purchase a majority voice for the government in
 the consortium.
 Both schemes as currently envisioned are un-
 acceptable to the consortium, which has
 threatened to sell out completely rather than bow
 to Vargas' demands. As an alternative, the com-
 pany has offered to operate the facilities and
 market the oil on a service contract basis, but
 Rene Vargas
 agreement would be difficult to reach with Vargas
 in control. Admiral Poveda, president of the
 supreme council of government, has called for
 talks between the two parties. In the event that
 the consortium pulls out, or alternatively, if
 Ecuador is able to purchase a controlling interest,
 the political and economic prospects of the coun-
 try will be eroded.
 Nationalizing Texaco-Gulf appeals to Vargas
 and apparently to General Duran, the army
 member of the triumvirate. The action also is ap-
 parently favored by certain colonels within the
 army who support Vargas and forced his appoint-
 ment on an unwilling Poveda. These colonels
 appear to have strong influence on the ruling jun-
 ta and may have enough power to veto certain
 appointments or policies.
 Admiral Poveda recognizes that Ecuador
 lacks the know-how to run the petroleum fields
 or market the product. Despite his misgivings
 about Vargas and his plans for the petroleum in-
 dustry, however, Poveda is in a weak position to
 challenge Vargas head-on. The navy is the junior
 service in Ecuador and is no match for the army in
 a showdown. Moreover, if the matter were put to
 a vote within the supreme council of government,
 Poveda almost certainly would lose to his two
 colleagues. Poveda is probably aware that his
 position is weak and knows that as long as Vargas
 remains in his powerful position, the chances for
 reaching an accommodation with Texaco-Gulf
 are slim.
 Vargas' actions are likely to diminish the
 prospects of further foreign investment in the
 petroleum industry, magnifying the country's
 severe economic problems. Leaders of the coun-
 try's civilian opposition have already questioned
 the triumvirate's competence and called for a
 return to democratic rule. As they become more
 aware of Vargas' machinations they will begin to
 oppose the  military rulers  more forcefully. ^",I

 ARGENTINA: PERON WILL NOT RUN
 President Peron's announcement on
 February 18 that she will not seek re-election
 appears to have eased the pressure for her im-
 mediate ouster. In a brief address to the nation,
 she declared she was "not interested in running
 for the next constitutional term." She again re-
 jected, however, the idea of stepping down
 before her current term expires in May of next
 year, citing an "historical mandate" to complete
 the term. To step down, she said, would only play
 into the hands of the left and cause "popular dis-
 ruption."
 The President was forced to make the an-
 nouncement when the Peronist labor movement
 and members of her own party threatened to join
 her opponents in protesting controversial moves
 she had made earlier in the week. Peron had ad-
 journed congress, closed down a critical
 newspaper, and called for major revisions-of the
 constitution.
 Peron sought to head off a move by congress
 to declare her "unable" to carry out her presiden-
 tial duties. Top labor leaders, increasingly at odds
 with the President, were reportedly giving serious
 consideration to supporting such a motion.
 Peron's declaration that she will not run for elec-
 tion should take the steam out of this effort.
 Indeed, the government late on Wednesday an-
 nounced it would reconvene congress next week.
 Top Peronist party officials, apparently satisfied
 with the President's latest moves, said they "fully
 support" her.
 Military leaders, eager to avoid the need to
 intervene directly, undoubtedly added to the
 pressure on the President in the last few days.
 That she has yielded even partially comes as a
 relief to the officers, who, though apparently
 poised to make a move, nonetheless have con-
 sistently expressed their preference for a civilian
 President Peron at recent meeting with labor leaders
