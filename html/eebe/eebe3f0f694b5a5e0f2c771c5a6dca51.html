NORTH KOREAN SUBVERSIVE DIPLOMACY 
The North Korean subversive activities in Ceylon and the 
North Korean involvement in training Mexican guerrillas have 
served to put the spotlight on other North Korean subversive 
activities around the world. Last month in Ceylon, Prime 
Minister Madame Bandaranaike, closed the North Korean Embassy 
and expelled its staff; this, less than a year after her 
government had recognized North Korea. Earlier, Mexican authorities 
rounded up 19 Mexicans who had received financial assistance 
and guerrilla training from North Korea. The Mexicans had 
been recruited at Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow and 
had been sent with Soviet assistance to Pyongyang for 
training. Five Soviet diplomats were expelled from Mexico 
City because of Soviet complicity in this venture. There is 
no North Korean diplomatic mission in Mexico. 
During India's general elections in March the Indian 
authorities found it necessary to warn the North Korean mission 
to cease its interference in the election campaign. And 
most recently the Indian Government told officials of the 
North Korean Consulate General that they will be expelled if 
they persist in the "undersirable activities". These 
"undesirable activities".include organizing meetings aimed at 
giving instruction on guerrilla warfare and spending 
extravagant sums on propaganda. 
In mid-April officials of the North Korean Embassy in 
Bucharest, Rumania made a spectacular attempt to kidnap the 
Belgian Ambassador in broad daylight. The Belgian Managed 
to escape, as he was helped by the crowd attracted by the 
struggle between three North Koreans and the Ambassador. 
At about the same time the North Korean Embassy in 
Bangui, Central African Republic was forced to close. 
President Bokassa's suspicions had been aroused because of 
North Korean diplomats' illegally crossing the border between 
the Central African Republic and the Congo. Later when the 
CAR's Ambassador in Pyongang was subjected to surveillance and 
harrassment, President Bokassa broke off relations and is 
now reported to be preparing to recognize South Korea. 
Elsewhere in Africa several countries have refused to 
agree to the establishment of diplomatic relations with North

Kbrea. Dahomey, Niger, Upper Volta and Mauritius resisted 
a major drive for diplomatic recognition by North Korea during 
1969. Upper Volta was particularly annoyed when a North 
Korean delegation refused to leave after having overstayed 
its visit. And on the island of Mauritius, the North Koreans' 
heavy-handed attempts to gain recognition visibly annoyed 
the Prime Minister and other officials, Although Zambia 
agreed to recognize North Korea, the Zambians have consistently 
rejected North Korean scholarship offers to young political 
leaders because they want to avoid extended Communist political 
indoctrination of these future leaders. 
Officials in Ghana broke off relations with North Korea 
shortly after Nkrumah was ousted in 1966. Also in 1966, Uruguay 
expelled a North Korean trade mission because of subversive 
activities. The Chilean newspaper La Prensa claimed on 
April 7, 1971 that North Korea was now one of the principal 
centers for training insurgents from Latin America and other 
countries. Nationals fpan Guatemala, Peru, Uruguay, Chile, 
Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia and Venezuela were all said to 
have attended guerrilla schools there. 
North Korea has maintained close contact with the 
Palestine guerrillas. George Habbash, leader of the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine visited Pyongyang last 
September to "learn and assimilate the experience of North Korea's 
great revolutionary struggle," And just before Hhbbash's 
visit, the North Koreans received a special envoy from Yasir 
Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization. It was in 
September that the Palestine guerrillas engineered the mass 
hijacking of three commercial airliners. At least one of 
the guerrilla officers responsible for the hijacking had been 
trained in North Korea. 
The Economist magazine in its issue of May 8, 1971 said:

"ThP trirnnp nf nirgnfcz prnhahl 7 thA 
most *portant and certainly the most dangerous 
aspect of North Korea's revolutionary programme. 
Since 1966, the Koreans have run a dozen training 
camps for foreigners: three in Pyongyang, two 
in NaMpo, two in Wonsan and five scattered, else-
where which train North Koreans as well. Rebels 
from 25 countries are said to have been invited 
to Korea for courses lasting between six and 
18 months; 1,300 from central and south America 
lnd 700 fr m Afrca " 
All the incidents and activities described above almost 
defy a rational explanation: Why does North Korea pursue

Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000300090001-4 
a worldwide program of support to guerrilla struggles which, 
in some areas, outdoes similar operations by Moscow and Peking? 
The explanation is in part ideological and in part emotional. 
Since 1945 North Korea has moved from the status of a Soviet 
satellite to become first, anally of China, next a critic 
of both the. USSR and China, and most recently a wary ally of 
both Communist powers. Emotionally, the leader of North 
Korea for the past 25 years, Kim Ii Sung, has had one 
persistent compelling motivation and that is tb:.eStablish 
himself as the leader of all Korean Kim believes that the 
highest form of struggle for freedom is fevolutionary violence. 
He considers himself the equal of Marx, the ideological 
successor to Ch 6 Guevara and Ho Chi Minh and the only challenger 
to Mao. Kim's pursuit of unification and self-reliance 
is financially supported by both the USSR and China. 
There is one interesting angle on the question of Soviet 
financial sponsorship of the North Korean activity in Asia. 
According to this theory the Soviet Union reached a conclusion 
that it could not hope to compete with the image of Mao Tse-
tung in Asia and the Middle East and therefore extended aid 
to the North Koreans so that they could finance local subversive 
organizations. The Soviets hoped that by backing North 
Korea they could build up Kim Il Sung's image to the extent 
that he might somewhat deflect from Mao's appeal. The Soviets 
believe it is essential to reduce the influence of Mho even 
if they are unable to make Kim Il Sung support Soviet causes. 
In choosing between the two Communist powers at any given 
moment Kim is swayed by realistic considerations, not by 
ideological niceties. In other words, Kim's revolutionary 
facilities are for sale to the highest bidder. Without the 
financial aid and other assistance received from both Moscow 
and Peking, Kim cannot maintain North Korea in the Revolutionary 
vanguard. On the other hand, among the many faces of international 
Communism, both the Soviets and Chinese clearly welcome, and 
encourage the fanatic, bruising brand of primitive Communist 
that Kim Il. Sung represents.,

NORTH KOREA'S INVOLVEMENT 
The Ceylon crisis has also served to put the spotlight on the subversive activities of 
tho North Koreans in various parts of the third world. North Korea's mission In Ceylon 
was closed by Mrs Bandaranaikc on 15 April, less than a. year after her governm,ent 
had recognised the Pyongyang.regime..'The North Koreans are unofficially reported to 
have given lectures to the insurgents and may also have helped to finance the rebellion. 
? ,Though it received comparatively little publicity in the world's press, the Mexican 
Government announced about six weeks ago the capture 'of a number of guerrillas 
who had been trained .in Pyongyang. Mexican extrmists are said to have contacted 
the North Korean. Embassy -while in Moscow under a Soviet scholarship scheme. 
The North Koreans promised to provide financial help and politico-military training; 
and the first group of Mexicans left for Pyongyang in '1968. Two other groups have 
followed.. 
In the Middle East, North ' Korea has sedulously tried to establish influence in 
Iraq, Algeria, Syria, Sudan, Egypt, South Yemen and the Lebanon. Friendship 
societies have been sct up, and there have been exchange visits by delegations of trade 
unionists, journalists, lawyers and health experts as well as politicians and military 
chiefs. A number of technical co-operation agreements have been signed, one of 'the 
most recent being with South Yemen in the field of broadcasting: 
North Korea has also shown: interest in the Palestinian Liberation' movement. 
George Habash, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine; spent 
some time in Pyongyang last September 'learning and assimilating the experience of 
your ? [North Korea's] great revolutionary struggle', according to the North Korean 
Central News Agency. A few weeks previously thc North 'Koreans received a special 
envoy from Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Other 
contacts included a visit last year by the North Korean deputy 'chief-of-staff to Al Fatah 
bases, during which he was reported by the newspaper Fatah to have expressed North 
Korea's :fill support for the Palestine revolution. ' 
Ceylon's' experience with North Korea inevitably raises questions about the extent 
, . 
to 'which the Pyongyang 'regime might be .using 'diplomatic activity as a cover for 
subversion. The North Korean embassy in Tanzania. has 'already provided corses for 
dissidents from independent African countries such as KehYa, Cameroun and Burundi. 
In addition', African 'freedom fighters' from colonial territories are among 'those 
who have been trained at North Korean training Centres which were placed at the 
disposal of 'guerrillas. This followed the decision of the 'Cuban-sponsored Afro-Asian-
Latin American Solidarity Organisation (AALAPSO) in. 1966 to set' up a number of 
such centres. The Chilean newspaper, La Prensa, claimed on 7 April that North Korea 
was now one' of the 'principal 'Centres' for training insurgents .from Latin America and 
, , 
other developing countries. ?

North Korea's dip! mate6 dirty tricks' 
The Indian Government have now 
told officials at thc North Korean 
Consulate-General in Delhi that 
they will be expelled if they per-
si in their " undesirable activi-
ties ". The North Korean mission 
has been put udder watch. 
This warning follows by some 
three weeks the sudden expulsion 
fruit Ceylon of the North Korean 
Amba-'dor and members of his 
st ff at the height of the left-wing 
ii ing. 'Plc reasons for their ex-
tol lsion were not disclosed. The 
/sl'arth Koreans were reported to 
have given lectures to the insur-
gl rite and are believed to have 
helped to finance the rebellion. It 
was noted that the Chinese 
Ambassador was at the airport to 
w sh them. farewell. 
As for "undesirable activities" 
by North Koreans in India, they 
have since last autumn spent what 
w-...re for than inordinately extra-
VI gant sums on hostile pro a-
guide in newspaper advertising 
cianpaigna?S54,000 according to 
a complaint by .Mr. Song C:hoi 
Woon, the Consular-General of; 
South Korea?and have also orga-
nIzed meetings aimed at giving in-
struction on guerrilla warfare to 
dose who attended. 
These incidents in Ceylon and 
Jodie hove 'focused attention on 
North Korean diplor. ats 
rz Hy and from a survey of inci-
dents it is clear enough that for 
the last two yews at least North 
Klorea ilea been working with 
Clink or for China, in subversive 
artivities all over the world. ? In 
p ces where China has no diplo-
matic representation of her own 
or in some places where she has, 
notably Ceylon, North Korea has 
been acting as front-runner or 
agent for China, on a scale 
greater than she could have bn 
ee 
expected to do on-her own and 
presumably, therefore. with 
Chinese funds. 
That at least is the inevitable 
conclusion to be drawn from in-
. 
stanees of irregular and costly 
. activity by North Korean diplo-
mats in Asia, Africa. Europe or 
Central and South America. 
The "undesirable activities" in 
which North Korean diplomats 
have been indulging inolude the 
organization pf guerrilla training 
and the financing of guerrilla 
action, spying and kidnapping. To 
this may be added the more?legiti-
mate tasks of advertising their own 
brand of revolution and the grant-
ing of inlereat-fras loans in poli-
tically , important and sensitive 
area's. 
The organization of.guerrilla 
training has been going on for at 
least two years. Clear evidence of 
this was produced in 'March this 
year by the Mexican Government 
who announced the capture of a 
number of Mexican guerrillas who 
had been trained in Pyongyang. 
Mexican extremists sent to Mos-
cow on Soviet scholarships are 
said to have contacted the North 
Korean Embassy there and been, 
?promised financial help and! 
politico-military training, The first 
group of Mexicans left for North 
Kore.a in 1968. Two other groups 
have followed. 
The Chilean newspaper ? La 
Prerisa claimed on April 7, 1971 
that North Korea was now one of 
the " principle centres " for train-
ing insurgents from Latin America 
and other develdping countries. 
Nationals from Guatemala. Peru, 
Uruguay, Chile, Brazil, Bolivia, 
Colombia and Venezuela, were all 
said to have attended in additicin 
to the Mexicans. North Korea also 
developed close ?'contacts with 
leaders of the Palestine guerrillas 
last autumn When the crisis be-
tween the guerrillas and the Jor-
danian Government was corning 
to a head. 
Dr. George Habbash, Secretary-
'General of the Popular Frorq for'

Koreans as well. Rebels from 25 
countries are said to have been invited 
to Korea for courses lasting between six 
and 18 months ; 1,3oo from central 
and south America 'arid 100 from 
Africa. 
The North Koreans also provide 
some military training abroad: their 
embassy in Tanzania has provided 
courses for dissidents from other 
African countries, including Kenya, 
Cameroon and Burundi. The Cubans 
paid Pyongyang to send six instructors 
in guerrilla warfare to Cuba two years 
ago and close Cuban-North Korean 
co-operation is thought to be respon-
sible for the large numbers of Latin 
Americans undergoing training in 
Korea. Last month the Chilean news-
paper La Prensa asserted that North 
Korea was a "principal centre" for 
'training Latin American insurgents. 
The Koreans have also lent strong 
moral and probably' material support 
to the Palestinian guerrillas. 
Although the main thrust of North 
Korean activity has been support for 
.insurgencies, Pyongyang has also spent 
millions on conventional-seeming aid 
projects like a match factory in Congo-
Brazzaville, tractors for Mauretania 
and import credits for Syria, Liberia,

difference was revealed at the anni-

summit conference in Peking last 
month. The North Koreans pointedly 
repeated the warning issued by Peking 
in the heat of the Laos invasion, but 
the Chinese dropped it completely. 
And the Pyongyang press has yet to 
report on the great American ping-

One recent escapade of the North 
Koreans should prove that they are

the Prime Minister, Mrs Bandaranaike, just 
ten months after Colombo and Pyongyang 
exchanged full diplomatic recognition. 
So far the Ceylonese Government has failed to 
provide an official reason for their forced departure. 
But the root cause is the unmistakable hand of North 
Korea in the "Che Guevarist:" rebellion currently (1L.,-

Ceylonese police have solid 
evidence linking ideological 
direction and finance of the 
youthful movement to the 
North Korean representation 
in the capital. 
For the past week the North, 
Korean Embassy has been i 
under constant military guard 
by a detachment of Ceylonese 
infantrymen. 
Led by the Ambassador, Mr 
Hwang Icing U, the North 
Koreans arrived at Colombo's 
international airport three hours 
before the Ilyushin jet that was 
taking them to Moscow.. 
The departing diplomatic 
group of eight men, four, women

quarter of a century has r-..,ed since Kim 
II-song returned to Pyongyang with the Soviet 
occupation forces to become the leader of 
the northern half,of a divided Korea. The long dura-
tion of Kim's leadership, the continued Stalinist 
pattern of the controls he has imposed on North 
Korean society, and the invariable dullness of the 
political sloganeering still emanating from Pyong-
yang twenty-five years later all tend to give the 
impression of immutability and to obscure the very 
real changes which have occurred in both the 
foreign and domestic policies of this isolated half-
nation on the eastern fringe of the Communist world. 
Externally, North Korea has moved since 1945 
from the status of a Soviet satellite to become first 
an ally of Communist China, next a bitterly antago-
iistic critic of both the USSR and the CPR, and most 
.ecently a wary ally of both Communist giants. In-
-ernally, Kim II-song has relentlessly purged from 
-he Korean Workers' Party and the North Korean 
government all but those most loyal to him, gradually 
,liminating the veteran Communist leaders with 
domestic roots predating Kim's return, as well as 
the factions with strong ties to either the USSR or 
the CPR. The North Korean society of some 13 
million people has experienced the full effect of

Korea. The urgency of this aspiration can only be 
understood in the context of the Korean heritage?
the history of a state which enjoyed 13 centuries 
of undivided, uninterrupted nationhood until sub-
jugated by Japanese imperialism at the outset of 
the current century. The eclipse of Korean nation-
hood lasted until the Allies' triumph over Japan in 
World War II. That victory, however, did not bring 
unity to the Korean nation; rather it resulted in the 
division of the Korean peninsula at the 38th parallel 
into separate Soviet and US occupation zones in 
which competing North and South Korean states 
emerged?creating an unstable situation in which 
both Korean governments feel their existence threat-
ened by the existence of the other. Each must foster 
and enhance its own self-image as the legitimate 
ruler of the Korean people or face the threat of 
extinction.1 
The legitimacy Issue Is often overlooked by 
analysts who view North Korean actions and policies 
largely in the context of the Sino-Soviet controversy. 
They tend to see Pyongyang as a victim of geopol-

and forced to frame its policies in response to the 
vicissitudes of that struggle.2 But, while Moscow and

UNIFICATION THROUGH REVOLUTION 
Comrades, the territorial partition and national split 
caused by the US imperialist occupation of South Korea 
have not only spelled unbearable miseries and sufferings 
for the South Korean people, but brought great national 
calamities to the entire Korean people and created a serious 
obstacle to the coordinated development of Korean society 
as a whole. 
To reunite the divided fatherland is a great national duty 
of all the Korean people at the present stage. It is our most 
urgent task, and we cannot forget it even for a moment. The 
policy of our party for the unification of our fatherland Is 
already known widely throughout the world. 
?Kim Il-song's speech to the Fifth Korean Workers' 
Party Congress, Radio Pyongyang Domestic Service, 
Nov. 2, 1970. 
The oppressed and exploited popular masses can win 
freedom and emancipation only through their own revolu-
tionary struggle. Therefore, the South Korean revolution 
should, in all circumstances, be carried out by the South 
Korean people on their own initiative. But the people in the 
northern half, being of the same nation, have the obligation 
and responsibility to support and actively encourage the 
South Korean people in their revolutionary struggle.

a far more vital asset in the Korean scheme of 
things?a strong alternative claim to be the legiti-
mate government of the Korean people. 
Kim II-song initiated his quest for legitimacy from 
a most disadvantageous position. After the Japanese 
surrender in 1945, the most prestigious of the na-
tionalist leaders returning to Korea naturally gravi-
tated to Seoul?the national capital?where even 
the "domestic" Communists (the name generally 
used to refer to those Communists who had stayed 
in Korea during Japanese rule) initially endorsed 
the naming of Syngman? Rhee as President of a 
"People's Republic." 3 Kim's regime in Pyongyang 
was clearly a puppet of the Soviet occupation forces, 
to which it owed its existence. The insecurity of the 
North Korean government was further demonstrated 
in 1948 when it refused to permit United Nations 
supervision of elections north of the 38th parallel.' 
In the same year UN-supervised elections took place

nized Rhee's government in the following words: 
There has been established a lawful government 
having effective control and jurisdiction over that 
part of Korea where the Temporary Commission was 
able to observe and consult and In which the great 
majority of the people of all Korea reside . . . the 
only such government in Korea.5 
Disillusioned with Kim's harsh rule and spurred by 
the growing awareness that Korea was likely to 
remain divided Indefinitely, North Koreans fled south-
ward, their total number reaching two Million or 
more, some 20 percent of the North Korean popula-
tion, between 1945 and the outbreak of the Korean 
War in 1950.? 
Desperate Gamble 
In light of this embarrassing mass emigration, 
Kim II-song's attempt to unify the country by force 
in 1950 appears to have been less a reckless venture 
than an essential gamble to assure the survival of 
his regime. The result, however, was nearly dis-
astrous. The United Nations labelled North Korea 
the "aggressor" In the conflict, and 16 nations sent 
troops to help in the defense of South Korea., The 
Pyongyang regime was saved only by the intervention 
of the Chinese Communist "volunteers," and the war 
ended in a stalemate.

and e_onomic might, aided generously in the effort 
by both the USSR and Communist China. Starting 
with what remained of the impressive pre-World 
War II Japanese industrial base in the North, Pyong-
yang undertook to industrialize at a breakneck pace. 
In 1958, doubtless influenced by the Chinese Great 
Leap Forward, Kim launched the "Ch'ollIma (Flying 
Horse) Movement." Like its Chinese counterpart, 
this movement counted on mass enthusiasm to spur 
production, but unlike Mao's economically disastrous 
program, the Korean movement also placed heavy 
reliance on technical expertise, which may explain 
its superior results.9 Successes in internal political 
mobilization and indoctrination in the North during 
this period were also impressive. In fact, the gains 
registered by the North during the second half of 
the 1950's caused grave concern in Seoul, par-
ticularly in view of the difficulties encountered in 
the last years of the Rhee government. 
The 1960's, however, witnessed a shift in the 
power balance in Korea and a curious countertrend 
in the legitimacy contest. These developments were 
triggered by the fall of the government of the aging 
Syngman Rhee in April 1960?an event which was 
precipitated by student riots reflecting internal dis-
content with Rhee's repressive policies, two years 
of Washington-Seoul friction over these policies, re-
duction in US aid, and an accompanying sharp down-
turn in economic growth.9 Regardless of the merits 
or failings of his government, Rhee was the nation's 
most famous independence leader?the man who 
had formed a provisional government during the 
abortive 1919 uprising against the Japanese. Thus, 
when he fell, the South Korean state lost the key 
symbol of its continuity with the Korean independ-
ence movement. 
For a little more than a year the successor civilian 
regime in Seoul grappled ineptly with its responsibil-
ities. But in 1961, the Army of the Republic of Korea 
seized power in order to put a stop to the chaos 
and factional infighting in Seoul, which threatened 
to weaken further the power of South Korea vis-a-vis

the North. By imposing firm central control and 
initiating broad reforms (including the introduction 
of economic planning and reform of the tax struc-
ture), the new military regime made substantial 
strides towards putting the South in a position to 
compete, both economically and militarily, with the 
Industrial North.'? However, these gains were 
achieved at a significant cost, for the coup which 
brought the regime to power had clearly broken the 
continuity of "legitimate" government originally es-
tablished by the UN-sponsored elections of 1948. In 
addition, the new South Korean leaders bore the 
stigma of having received their military training 
under the Japanese. 
Meanwhile, emboldened by North Korea's eco-
nomic advances in the late 1950's, Kim II-song 
moved vigorously during the following decade to 
demonstrate his independence and to bolster his 
own claim to leadership of the Korean nation. Al-
though his immediate response to the 1961 coup in 
the South was to negotiate bilateral mutual-defense 
treaties with Moscow and Peking, Kim soon showed 
signs of shifting to a fiercely independent foreign 
policy, even at the risk of antagonizing both Com-
munist allies and at the cost of losing, at least 
temporarily, their economic assistance. Pyongyang's 
assertion of independence first from Moscow and 
then from Peking, the 1968 seizure of the USS

Pyongyang vs. Its Allies 
In dealing with the USSR and Communist China, 
Kim has had to reckon not only with the diverse 
efforts of the two to interfere in his policies, but also 
with the reality that neither of them attaches great 
significance to Kim's goal of unification. In choosing 
between the two Communist powers at any given 
moment, the North Korean leader has been swayed 
by realistic considerations of self-preservation and 
-not by ideological niceties. 
Already in 1951, Pyongyang resented the Soviet 
decision to bring about early Korean armistice nego-
tiations, feeling that the only likely outcome would 
be an intolerable recognition of the division of 
Korea, the very situation which Kim had sought to 
eliminate by his attack on the South. Subsequently 
(after the Korean armistice).Kim's regime?evidently 
convinced that the USSR would not support any 
further unification efforts?set out to build a strong 
and independent economic, political and military 
base which would enable it, at some future time, 
to launch another unification attempt on its own." 
It was because of these independent policies of 
North Korea that the Soviet Union in 1956 instigated 
a "destalinization" campaign In Pyongyang with the 
goal of undermining Kim's position in the North 
Korean regime. However, Kim had crushed this 
challenge by 1958. Because of Kim's insistence 
on independent policies, relations between Moscow 
and Pyongyang continued to deteriorate despite the 
signing of the 1961 mutual assistance pact, and in 
1963 the USSR terminated its economic and military 
assistance to North Korea in retaliation for Kim's 
independent behavior. 
A factor contributing to the Soviet discontent 
was Kim's growing friendship with Peking. Yet the 
latter relationship also had its areas of disagreement. 
Kim Il-song saw the widening Sino-Soviet rift as a 
threat to the defense capability of the Communist 
world, and hence of North Korea, and his resentment 
at Ma :ist policies grew particularly intense as a 
consequence of Chinese obstruction of Soviet aid 
shipments to North Vietnam in 1966. Furthermore,

Korea in 1963?a matter of great concern to Kim 
as he witnessed the growth of South Korea's military 
power. Finally, Mao's strident Claims to the leader-
ship of the world revolutionary movement conflicted 
with Kim's own ambitions, When the Soviet Union 
reversed course in 1965 and restored the flow of 
economic and military assistance to Pyongyang, 
the Chinese Communists showed their displeasure by 
mounting wall posters in Peking denouncing Kim 
Il-song as a "fat revisionist" (for having sold out to 
Moscow). By 1966 relations between North Korea 
and the CPR were so chilly that neither country main-
pined an ambassador in the other's capital. This 
kstrangement was evident as late as April 1969 when 
Pyongyang pointedly refused to send a delegate to 
the Ninth Congress of the CCP." 
Since North Korea's troubles with its allies sprang 
from Soviet or Chinese policies that put restraints 
on Pyongyang's military and economic capacity, or 
which cast shadows on Kim's image of independence 
in formulating foreign policy, and not from basic 
ideological issues, reconciliation was a relatively 
simple matter once the objectionable policies were 
renounced. Thus, when Moscow offered to restore aid 
to North Korea in 1965, Pyongyang promptly re-
sumed cordial relations with the Soviets. And it was 
with equal pleasure that Kim accepted China's truce 
offering when Chou En-lai visited Pyongyang in April 
1970 to assure North Korea: 
In the future, we will, as always, support and assist 
each other and fight shoulder to shoulder." 
The two countries concluded a trade agreement 
shortly thereafter. Not to be outdone, the Soviet 
Ambassador to North Korea sought to cement Mos-
cow's renewed ties with . Kim by declaring, on the 
occasion of the ninth anniversary of the Korean-
Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual 
Assistance in July 1970: 
The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet 
Government, and the entire Soviet people fully sup-
port the Korean people in their righteous struggle 
to chase the US imperialist aggressive troops out of 
South Korea and to achieve national unification on 
a democratic basis."

Thus, by the end of 1970, relations between 
Pyongyang and each of its two major Communist 
E- 'lies seemed reasonably amicable. As far as the 
Sino-Soviet conflict was concerned, Kim II-song 
pparently saw no contradiction in maintaining 
cordial relations with both countries simultaneously. 
However, Pyongyang saw fit to exercise Caution in 
making sure the visiting delegations from Peking 
cr Moscow di u not cross paths while they were in 
North Korea." 
Kim welcomes the support of the USSR and the 
CPR because of a genuine fear for the security of 
North Korea, which seems to him to be threatened 
loth by an increasingly strong South Korea and by 
E possible resurgence of Japanese militarism. Few 
Koreans who lived through the trying years of 
Japanese colonialism and who confronted Japan's 
ighly efficient military rule and (political) "thought" 
once can dismiss the nagging fear that it could all 
appen again?however unrealistic this may seem 
t) foreign observers. The recent announcement by 
tie United States of plans to reduce its forces in 
.outh Korea has brought forth warnings from 
Pyongyang that Japan may try to move into the US 
role in South Korea?warnings which have been 
tr-npathetically echoed in Peking. 
Kim and World Revolution 
While turning to Moscow and Peking to secure his 
ngime against real or imagined enemies, Kim II-song 
I-as not hesitated to challenge the revolutionary 
leadership of both major Communist centers. As 
early as 1965 (prior to the resumption of Soviet aid 
to North Korea), Kim delivered a thinly-veiled attack 
4gainst Moscow, accusing the Soviet leaders of being 
"tevisionists" bent on preventing North Korea from 
securing economic independence and on overthrow-
ing his regime." Kim also seems to be trying to 
outdo Mao in bidding for leadership of the world's 
r wolutionary movements, basing his appeal on a 
Elorification of the tactics of violent revolution. On 
tie 50th anniversary of the unsuccessful nonviolent 
anti Japanese uprising of 1919, Kim stated: 
7 he greatest lesson of the historic anti-Japanese 
"The Chinese (and not the Soviets) on July 25, 1970, attended 
II e commemoration of the outbreak of the Korean War; the 
S wiets (and not the Chinese) attended the 25th anniversary of 
K rean independence from Japan. There was no report of either being 
n resented at the Fifth KWP Congress last autumn. 
"Kim II Sung, Selected Works, English Edition, Pyongyang, 
Foreign Language Publishing House, Vol. II, p. 513. 
movement is that the highest form of struggle to 
freedom Is revolutionary violence." 
Thus, Kim has Identified himself with the movements 
of Che Guevara and Ho Chi Minh and apparently 
seeks to promote himself as their ideological suc. 
cessor. The North Korean leader 6eemIngly strikes 
a responsive chord among some of the world's new 
revolutionaries?e.g., the American Black Panther 
Jeader Eldridge Cleaver visited Pyongyang in 1969 and 
voiced praise for Kim's revolutionary leadership." 
Kim's appeals to revolution are hardly likely to 
win recognition of North Korea as a member of the 
established international community. Ever since the 
Korean War, the Pyongyang regime has been,/ in 
effect, an international outlaw. Only 29 nations recog-
nize Kim's state, compared to 93 nations which 
-recognize the government in Seoul." Kim adamantly 
refuses to recognize the competence of the UN to 
deal with the Korean problem. This defiance of the 
International body?to which the USSR is, at least in 
part, committed?may explain the visit of the Soviet 
and Czechoslovak UN Ambassadors to Pyongyang in 
August 1970.gu One may surmise that they went to 
discuss possible new initiatives on behalf of North 
Korea at the impending session of the UN General 
Assembly which opened in September. But it would 
take extreme changes in the UN's position vis-a-vis 
North Korea to convince Kim II-song that he could 
more effectively gain national and international pres-
tige through the world organization rather than by 
trying to win a following among revolutionaries every-
where. 
Closely related to Kim's efforts to achieve stature 
both at home and in the world revolutionary move-
ment is the cultivation of an extravagant personality 
cult of Kim Il-song. Advertisements for a recent 
English-language version of his official biography 
presumed to call Kim "the Hero of [the] 20th 
Century." 21 The cult seeks to provide Kim with an 
impressive set of revolutionary credentials?more 
impressive, in fact, than the, facts would support. 
His father, Kim Hyong-chik, is now credited by the 
Pyongyang regime with bringing about the 1919 
anti-Japanese uprising.22 To those who have observed

chu, in the party hierarchy, this exercise In revolu-
tionary genealogy appears aimed not only at prov-
ing the nationalist credentials of Kim 11-song, but 
also at laying the groundwork for the political suc-
cession in North Korea.25 
To explain why the 33-year old Kim deserved to 
become the leader of North Korea in 1945, the 
regime has embellished and distorted the record of 
his prewar exploits against the Japanese in Man-
churia, then under Japanese domination as the 
puppet state of Manchukuo. It is claimed that when 
Kim moved to Manchuria from Pyongyang at the age 
of 14, he organized an independence movement 
among fellow Korean students at his middle school, 
joined the Korean Communist Party, and helped 
found numerous independence organizations, e.g., 
The Kirin Student-Friends Association and the 
Fatherland Restoration Association. Further, it is 
implied that the guerrilla band which Kim came to 
lead was almost singlehandedly responsible for the 
ultimate liberation of Korea. All evidence of Chinese 
Communist or Soviet support for Kim and other 
Korean guerrilla leaders Is passed over." 
n Nodong Shinmun of March 1, 1970, claimed: "With the March 
First Uprising as the occasion, the seeds of the anti-Japanese 
patriotic ideas and revolution sown by Mr. Kim Hyong-chik, an 
anti-Japanese revolutionary fighter and ardent patriot, kindled 
violent flames everywhere." 
'The possibility that KIM Yong-chu (who is 10 years younger 
than his brother Kim II-song) might succeed his brother was 
suggested by the author In the article, "Divided Korea 1969: 
Consolidating for Transition," Asian Survey, January 1970, p. 41. 
For Kim Yong-chu's rise through the party ranks, see the charts 
In Joungwon A. Kim, "Soviet Policy in North Korea," foe. cif., 
pp. 252-54. Among those subsequently agreeing with this hypothesis 
Is VI Tong-jun, a defector from North Korea,: see his "Kwolyok 
t'ujaeng-ul chinsang" (The Real' Power Struggle), Chungang (SWOT, 
June 1970, pp. 67-81. 4 
w Balk Bong, Kim il Sung Biography, Tokyo, Miraisha, 1969. 
The true picture of Kim's record emerges in such 
works as Dae-sook Suh's study of the Korean Com-
munist movemerit.25 Kim did, indeed, attend middle 
school in Japanese-COntrolled Manchuria, but there 
were hardly enough fellow Koreans in his Chinese-
run school to constitute an "independence move-
ment." Organizations which Kim allegedly founded 
were, in fact, founded by others; his name does not 
even appear in accounts of such organizations by 
former participants or in Japanese intelligence and 
police records. As a matter of fact, the Korean 
Communist Party had no organization in Manchuria 
at the time Kim claims to have joined it. Extensive 
Japanese records show that Kim 11-song and his 
companions in the present North Korean regime 
were only minor participants in the Chinese Com-
munist underground resistance movement in Man-
churia. Furthermore, Kim's biography completely 
omits the four-year period (1941-45) which he spent 
in training in the USSR, emerging as a major in the 
Soviet Army.26 
The fact that his fledgling regime drew insignifi-
cant national support in 1945 has also troubled Kim. 
At the Third Congress of the Korean Workers' Party, 
held in Pyongyang in 1956, Kim bitterly denounced 
those Korean Communists who had endorsed the 
Rhee government in 1945. Immediately prior to the 
1956 Congress, Kim purged from the KWP the vast 
majority of South Korean Communists who had come 
north prior to and during the Korean conflict (many 
of whom had joined in the earlier endorsement of 
Rhee)." Kim 11-song also has claimed that prominent 
Korean independence leaders such as Kim Ku and 
Kim Kyu-sik had endorsed the Pyongyang regime?
significantly, neither man is around to refute it (Kim 
Ku had shared the limelight with Rhee in Seoul as 
a leader of the exile Provisional Government estab-

Entrenched and Isolated 
The ability of the North Korean regime to fabricate 
and propagate such a fulsome cult of Kim II-song 
is itself a symptom of the extreme consolidation of 
power in Kim's hands. This is a far cry from the 
situation in the early days of the Communist regime, 
when North Korea was ruled by a coalition of Soviet-
Koreans, Yenan-trained Koreans, domestic Korean 
Communists, and the Manchurian-Korean partisans 
centered around Kim II-song." Step by step Kim 
eliminated all competing factions, a process which 
culminated at a leadership conference of the Korean 
Workers' Party in October 1966, at which Kim suc-
ceeded in placing his own followers in every major 
KWP post. Party organization work was entrusted 
to Kim's younger brother, Kim Yong-chu. This mono-
lithic control was further tightened in subsequent 
purges," and was most recently confirmed at the 
Fifth KWP Congress, held November 2-13, 1970.'At-
this congress Kim Yong-chu was elevated to the 
Political Committee of the KWP Central Committee 
as the sixth-ranking party officia1.31

29 The Soviet-Koreans were SOviet citizens of Korean descent who 
had spent the better part of their lives In the USSR, most of whom 
were members of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union 
(CPSU)?an affiliation which some retained even after joining the 
Korean Workers' Party in North Korea. This group was distinct 
from the Manchurian-Koreans around Kim II-song, who had spent 
most of their lives In Manchuria and only resided In the USSR 
In the 1941-45 period. The Soviet-Koreans originally endorsed 
Kim II-song as leader of the North Korean party, but It was on 
Soviet orders, and Kim had no control over this group. The Yenan 
Communists were those who had spent their exile in China, most 
recently in Mao Tse-tung's Yenan stronghold. The "domestic" 
Korean Communists were those i who had remained in Korea and had 
suffered persecution and Imprisonment under the Japanese?a 
factor which prevented any effective organizational development. 
Kim II-song refuses to credit any of the other three factions for 
their pre-1945 independence efforts. 
39 Among high-ranking party end military leaders purged since 
the Kim group completed Its consolidation have been Pak Kum-ch'ol, 
Kim Chang-bong, Ho Pong-hak,:Kim Chong-t'ae, Kim To-man, 
Vim Ch'un-ch'iu, Ko Hyok, and Ho Sok-san. See VI Tong-jun, toc. cit. 
For information on earlier purges of the regime, see 
Pukhanul papol runaeng-sa (Factional Struggle in North

Committee were listed as follows: Kim ll-song, Choe Yong-gon, 
Kim II, Pak Song-chol, Choe Hyon,- Kim Yong-chu, 0 Chln-u, Kim 
Tong-gyy, So Choi, Kim Chung-him, and Han 1k-au (North Korean 
*elle b. ead..a.t, No.. 14, 1978). 
While consolidating his personal control of the 
party, Kim II-song has also tightened the regimE's 
controls over North Korean society to ensure that 
no voice of dissent can be raised against his leadE r-
ship. Collectivization of agriculture was completed 
In 1958. By 1970 nearly 50 percent of the population 
of 13 million lived In urban areas (compared to 
about 20 percent in 1945), and illiteracy had been 
virtually eliminated?both developments facilitating 
political mobilization of the population. Some 4-0 
percent of the population is employed in the inths-
trial sector of the economy,32 as compared with 12,5 
percent at the end of 1946. Through party membE r-
ship, employment In the bureaucracy, and membE r-
ship in the many diverse and overlapping state-
sponsored mass organizations, a very large propc r-
tion of the population has been absorbed into roles 
which commit the individual to active support )f 
the Kim leadership and thus link his personal destiny 
with that of the regime. Nearly 14 percent of the 
population are members of the KWP; 1.3 million 
citizens serve in the "Workers' and Peasants' Red 
Guard" (a nationwide mass militia, organized into 
self-contained armed regiments); and 10 to 15 
.percent of the working population are bureaucratic 
employees of the regime. 
The Communists have also sought to differentiate 
and isolate society in the North from that in the 
South?this despite the professed goal of unification. 
Nearly three-fourths of the 13 million North Korea is 
have spent all but perhaps their preschool years 
under Communist rule and indoctrination. The or ly 
information they have about possible alternativ 
comes covertly from their elders, and as in a iy 
society undergoing rapid modernization and change, 
the relevance of the views of the older generation is 
generally felt to be marginal. Few people in tie 
North, moreover, have any firsthand knowledge of 
life below the 38th parallel since 1945?not only hs 
the refugee flow been almost unilaterally toward tie 
South, but most of the South Korean Communits 
who went to the North prior to or during the Korean 
War were purged during the 1950's. 
In another move clearly designed to ensure that 
the populace was insulated from undesirable out-
side influences, Kim eliminated the Chinese writing 
system soon after gaining power, replacing it with 
the Korean phonetic alphabet. Consequently, fE w 
North Koreans could even read the South Korean

This insulation of North from South has made it 
easier for the regime to forge ahead with its policy 
of giving top priority to heavy industrial development 
at the expense of consumption. By and large, this 
policy has produced impressive results, although the 
temporary suspension of Soviet economic assistance 
from 1963 to 1965 forced Pyongyang to abandon 
annual targets of the 1961-1967 Seven Year Plan. 
Following the resumption of Soviet aid in 1965, 
Pyongyang reactivated the plan and extended the 
target date for its completion to 1970. The recent 
Fifth KWP Congress announced the successful com-
pletion of the plan and promulgated a new Six-Year 
Plan for the 1971-76 period, with continued empha-
sis on heavy industry (although there was new 
emphasis on light industry, mechanization of agri-
culture and technological development). Despite 
the dip in performance in the mid-1960's, North 
Korea has built up a formidable economic potential. 
It produces most of the rifles, mortars and ammuni-
tion required by its army, and it also outproduces

it continues to face the same critical questions of 
how Korean nationalism, communism, and a divided 
Korea can be reconciled. How can a viable political 
system be maintained over 13 million Koreans in the 
North while the remaining two-thirds of the nation

regime in the South? It is not so much the peculiar 
personal predilections of North Korea's strong-arm 
ruler as it is the pressures arising from these 
ineluctable circumstances that have transformed 
North Korea into what has appropriately been termed 
a "garrison state," 34 with its leader advocating 
revolutionary violence and constantly trumpeting 
invective against enemies and allies alike. So long 
as a genuine aura of national and international 
legitimacy continues to evade Kim ll-song's regime, 
these pressures will continue.

Incident, Kim founded an anti-
Japanese guerrilla "army" which 
is claimed to have waged a "heroic 
struggle against the Japanese," 
culminating in the liberation of 
Korea. The book also states cate-
gorically that it was not the United 
States, but the Soviet Union, to-
gether with the guerrilla forces 
commanded by Kim, that defeated 
the Japanese in World War II. The 
book asserts that the Americans 
and British induced the Soviets to 
bear the brunt of the fighting, and 
then "brazenly" tried to claim 
credit for the victory. 
This, however, is the last favor-
able mention of the Soviet Union 
one encounters. In its effort to 
portray Kim II-song as the greatest 
figure in all Korean history, the 
book credits him with all good 
things that transpired in North 
Korea since 1945. He almost sin-
giehandedly "won" the Korean 
War of 1950-53, which allegedly 
was started by "American imperi-
alistic aggressors and their South 
Korean lackeys." Conspicuously 
absent in this chauvinistic account 
1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000300090001-4 
Is any mention of Soviet military 
assistance or of the "Chinese 
' People's Volunteers" to whom 
North Korea owes its survival. 
Likewise it was Kim's "revolution-
ary ideas" and "Ingenious leader-
ship"?not assistance from the 
Communist bloc?which subse-
quently transformed the war-
devastated country into a "self-re-
liant" industrial nation. 
The volume imputes "epochal" 
, significance to Kim's ideas, of 
'which juche constitutes the pivotal 
'concept. Translated as "independ-
ent stand," the term is defined to 
mean "abiding by the principle 
of solving all problems of the 
revolution and construction inde-
pendently, in accordance with the 
actual conditions of one's own 
country and -primarily- bi one's 
own efforts." Having "demon-
strated" the inestimable efficacy 
of?juche in the North Korean con-
text, the book presumes to apply 
the concept on a global scale. 
This entails repudiation of both 
"the right-wing opportunism" of 
Moscow and "the left opportun-
ism" of Peking' in favor of form-
ing a united Communist front to 
crush "American imperialism." 
Somehow, the author never ex-
plains how such a course of action 
is related to an "independent 
stand" for North Korea. Nor is 
there the slightest recognition of 
the colossal contradiction between 
the notion of independence and 
the exhortation not only to the 
Korean people but to all leaders 
of the Communist orbit to heed 
?the wisdom of Kim II-song. 
Who is the real Kim, the man 
behind this image of an omni-
scient and omnipotent leader of all 
1Korea and the savior of mankind? 
For the best available clueslo his 
Although neither Moscow nor Peking are 
explicitly mentioned, Kim's words leave 
little doubt as to the Identity of those whom 
he is attacking.

true identity, one must turn to 
T.lae-Sook Suh's meticulous study, 
The Korean Communist Move-
ment. Originally prepared as a 
Ph.D. thesis at Columbia, the 
study makes extensive use of 
Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and 
Russian sources to present an im-
pressively credible picture of the 
trials and tribulations of Korean 
Communists who struggled long 
and hard, only to be eclipsed and 
then ?inihilated by Kim II-song, 
a man who had played only a 
peripheral role in the Korean in-
dependence movement. Of par-
ticular interest is the last quarter 
of the book, dealing with the rise 
of Kim II-song. Relying heavily on , 
Japanese police records of the ' 
1930's and 1940's, the author 
shows that Kim was neither a com-
plete impostor nor a major revolu-
tionary figure of the stature of a 
Mao Tse-tung or Ho Chi Minh. 
The available evidence estab-
lishes that, prior to World War II, 
Kim led a Korean anti-Japanese 
guerrilla force in Manchuria which 
inflicted sufficient damage to 
cause the Japanese to initiate a 
determined campaign to annihilate 
his forces. On the other hand, Suh 
makes c!ear, Kim's force was at 
this time only part of a Chinese 
Communist guerrilla army, in 
which he rose to the rank of divi-
sion commander. Despite this im-
pressive title, Kim probably never 
commanded more than 300 men 
at a time. Nor was he the only 
Korean to command such a "divi-
sion." In fact, at least two Koreans 
rose to the position of "army 
commander"?a full rank higher 
than Kim?in this struggle.' 
Under stepped-up Japanese 
pressure, Kim and his surviving 
comrades-In-arms fled to Siberia 
in 1941. Whether he subsequently 
received Soviet military training 
and served as an officer in the 
Red Army, as many sources claim, 
is not verified in Suh's study. What, 
clear, however, is that he came 
to North Korea with i the Soviet 
occupation troops after the Jap-
anese surrender. in 1945 ? pd, 
with the apparent blessing of 'the 
Soviet Union, began a series of 
maneuvers culminating. in 
seizure of power in Pyongyang. 
Suh underscores4h.e,.point that 
Kim did not owe his Ase exclu-
sively to the Kremlin. Of crucial 
importance were the miscalcula-
tions and follies of the "old Com-
munists," such as Pak kon-yong, 
who lingered too long in the 
An important source on Kim's guerrilla 
activity has recently come to the reviewer's 
attention: Manshu nl kansuru yoheitekl 
kansatsu (Observations on Military Tactics 
In Manchuria), Tokyo, Fukuinkyoku Shiryo 
Seirika, Vol. 12, 1952. The volume comprises 
recollections by former Japanese Army 
officers who participated in or had access to 
classified information about Japanese 
counterinsurgency operations in Manchuria. 
While corroborating much of Suh's account 
of Kim's revolutionary past, this Japanese 
source links Kim and his guerrillas, not with 
the Chinese Communists, but with the 
Soviet Union, from which they are said 
, to have received the bulk of their arms and 
ammunition, and which provided them 
with refuge when they fled across the 
Siberian border under Japanese pursuit. It 
also includes a number of photographs of 
Kim Il-song In guerrilla' attire and states that 
Kim was extremely popular among 
Koreans In Manchuria, who acClaimed him 
as a "hero of Korea" and gave him 
"material and moral suppOrt." I am grateful 
to Mr. Key P. Yang, of the Oriental's 
Division of the Library of Congress, 
Washington, D.C., for giving me access to 
this rare source. 
American-occupied South, where 
:the chances of a Communist take-
over? were nil, instead of rushing 
to the North where establishment 
,of a Communist government was 
a foregone conclusiOn. When Pak 
and his associates finally headed 
north under duress, Kim was al-
ready firmly entrenched and, soon 
had his rivals exterminated as 
American spies. Kim's political 
takeover was due in no small 
measure to his political acumen 
and Machiavellian tactics?fac-
tors which have been equally in-
strumental in perpetuating his 
monolithic political contr4for the 
past two decades. 
As one leaves the bizarre legend 
of Kim II-song, one wonders why 
Kim and his sycophants persist in 
their Herculean efforts .to create 
a mountain out of a molehill. Pos-
sibly they believe, with Hitler, the 
dietum: "the bigger the lie, the 
better." More probably, Kim may 
be the unwitting victim of his own 
personality cult?a man who not 
only derives satjsfaction from the 
interminable cries of "Long Live 
Comrade Kim II-song" but has 
really come to believe in his own 
"unrivaled greatness" and "his-
toric mission" to lead 'men both 
in- Korea and beyond. One shud-
ders at the thought that Kim, 
thanks to Moscow and Peking, 
commands considerable resources 
to pursue that "mission."

CPYRGHT 55 More Pathet Lao Defect To Vientiane 
JM ISun Stall Correspondent 
aigon, May 11?Fifty-five 
mbers of the 11th Pathet Lao 
lBattalion have defected to the 
Huai Lao government, accord-
in reliable reports from the 
Laitian capital of Vientiane. 
The defectors, led by their 
co nmanding officer, are the 
thwd group of Laotian Commu-
ni t soldiers to defect since 
March. They said there are 
more than a thousand other Pa-
that Lao soldiers in southern

5Z soldiers, including a lieuten-
art colonel, two captains and 
two first lieutenants in addition 
to their commander, surren-
lifted yesterday at Ban Itou, 
which Is about 20 miles east of 
the southern city of Pakse. 
The soldiers turned in their 
weapons and volunteered to aid 
government troops in recruiting 
more defectors and in hunting 
for supply caches and North Vi-
etnamese base camps in south-
ern Laos. 
In March, 150 members of the 
25th Pathet Lao Battalion, many 
with their.families, defected to 
the government side, complain-
ing of oppression by the North 
Vietnamese. 
April, Surrender 
In April, 18 Pathet Lao sol-
diers surrendered as a group 
near the central Laotian town of 
Paksane, also complaining 
about their North Vietnamese 
advisers. 
Diplomatic observers in Vien-
tiane have described the grow-
ing Pathet Lao defections as 
! probably the most significant 
change in recent months in the 
seesawing war in Laos. 
The defection of large num...! 
!bers of Pathet Lao, Western dip-; 
Iomats assert, will significantly ' 
reduce the Communists' influ-
ence and undermine their claim 
to be patriots rather than front I 
men for the North Vietnamese. ;

the North Vietnamese are now 
finding themselves in the posi-
tion of clamping down upon the 
Xathet Lao allies in an effort to 
'halt the -defections but possibly;

situation and risking widespread

FOR BACKGROUND USE ONLY June 1971 
HOW TO STAGE-MANAGE A CONGRESS 
From the 24th Congress of the CPSU 30 March - 10 April, one 
surprise.calls for explanation: the uniform silence on the part 
of visiting delegations speaking at the Congress concerning the 
Soviet invasion and "normalization" of Czechoslovakia, the major 
issue (among other, derivative issues) that has given rise to 
criticism of the Soviet Union by a large number of important and 
lesser Communist parties of the world. It is hard to find even the 
word Czechoslovakia mentioned in the speeches of the 101 delegations 
(some non-Communist) said to have attended the Congress. 
Several interrelated issues have been argued and debated more 
or less heatedly since the invasion (more often for home consump-
tion but also at Soviet-sponsored gatherings of the world's 
Communists): the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, 
the enunciation of the Brezhnev Doctrine of limited sovereignty, 
the primacy of "proletarian internationalism" (read: obedience 
to Soviet dictates) over the right of national sovereignty of 
socialist countries and independence of Communist parties, the 
mandatory subjection to general "laws" of socialism (i.e. the 
Soviet "model") versus the right of Communist parties to develop 
their "own road to socialism" based on their national peculiarities. 
Suddenly, at the Congress, these issues seem to have dis-
appeared. Reading various versions of the speeches of visiting 
delegates, one would hardly know that there were such issues of 
contention in the Communist world -- and perhaps that is precisely 
the point. Aware of the image of disarray in the world Columnist 
movement (WCM), the Soviets needed desperately to restore at least 
the appearance of unity in the movement. Hence, they somehow 
contrived to suppress the voices of dissent and impress the world 
Communist movement with a picture of harmony and unity restored. 
Some delegates may even have been convinced there never had heel, 
any basic disagreement. It mattered less that one or another dele-
gate returning home might speak to their own countrymen in disan!)rcval 
of certain Soviet acts or methods -- the important thing was that 
these disagreements not be given currency or additional momentum 
in the world Communist movement by being aired at the Congress in 
Moscow.

There is every reason to believe that the Soviets took special 
precautions to insure that the views of known dissidents not come 
before the Congress. Some were no doubt pressured or persuaded 
to refrain from objectionable comment: the threat of withdrawal 
of Soviet financial support can be a persuasive weapon to many 
parties. But special measures to stage-manage a Congress have a 
well-documented precedent in the case of the 10th Congress of the 
Communist front JUS (International Union of Students) held last 
February in the out-of-the-way location of Bratislava, Czechoslovakia. 
First, it was held behind closed doors; all correspondents but two 
from the Soviet youth newspaper were excluded from the proceedings. 
Careful guard checks were made on all those entering the immediate 
area of the Congress; unauthorized persons were prevented from 
talking with the delegates. By various devices, objectionable 
delegates were precluded from expressing their views. Some were 
refused visas to get there in the first place, others were sent 
back on arrival, others were harassed by the police. Dissident 
delegates present could not make their views or protests known. 
Their proposals were either ignored and passed over in silence, 
or at one point, the simultaneous translation facilities conven-
iently broke down. The full range of devices for suppressing 
dissent, and, more important for the Soviets, ensuring the appearance 
of complete unity, is described in the account by French delegate 
Henri Verley as published in the French Comnunist dissident weekly 
Politique Hebdo (see attachment). 
Judging by scattered accounts from various delegates on their 
return home, similar measures were taken to stage-manage the 24th 
CPSU Congress, with the primary aim of preventing delegates from 
getting a picture of what divides the movement and of presenting 
the delegates with a picture of monolithic unity. It, too, was a 
closed session with foreign correspondents excluded. Various measures 
were taken to isolate visiting delegates known for their dissident 
views from reporters and from the Soviet population. Dissident 
delegations had difficulty gaining access to translation facilities 
and efforts were made to prevent them from distributing their speeches 
among other delegates. Their speeches, according to some accounts, 
were submitted to a special bureau which simply deleted or modified 
highly objectionable passages, so that while a delegate; might deliver 
his own version of the speech in his native language, the Congress 
would hear in translation only the expurgated version.

able to report one example, apparently among many, of the censcr-
ship procedure. Chilean Communist delegate Luis Corvalan, speaking 
in Spanish, at one point proudly announced that his Marxist 
government nas recognized both Cuba and Communist China. Since the 
simultaneous translation simply omitted mention of China, the delegates

duly applauded 'Chilean recognition of Cuba. Somewhat puz'zled at 
the response, Corvalan repeated his statement, and this time, for 
some reason and after a moment's hesitation, the: interpreter included 
mention of iifi?Dead silence from the audience. Corvalan must 
still be puzzlen at what happened. (See the attached Astrachan 
article.) 
The cynical, methodical planning that went into controlling 
the expression of deviant views on the part of supposedly fraternal 
delegates at the 24th CPSU Congress i% at oncea measure of the 
erosion of the Soviet ideological poAffion.in the WCM and of 
Soviet fears that the -6rosion will gather momentum and affect 
organizational control as well. Hence, the effort not so much to 
eradicate dissent, but to prevent the WowId Communist Movement, 
from hearing about it. Strong disapproval Of Soviet leadershi0 of 
the world movement has been expressed, and is still being expressed, 
in their home environments by Communist parties of Italy, France, 
Austria, Spain, Great Britain, Japan, Australia, India, Venezuela, 
Mexico, Romania, and Yugoslavia (to mention only some of the better 
known ones). Yet, the Soviets succeeded in mounting a Congress in 
which hardly a word of disapproval reached this assembly of the 
world's Communists. instead they heard the delegates' paeans of 
praise for the achievements of the Soviet Union and resounding 
expressions of their solidarity with an alien power and its leading 
force, the CPSU.

POLITIQUE HEBDO, Paris 
25 February 1971 
BEHIND THE SCENES AT A CONGRESS  
?14- ofthe International Union of Students  
Little has been said about the 10th Congress of the International 
laion of Students (IUS) held in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia 3-10 February 
this year, and for good reason. A closed meeting was proclaimed from 
the very first session, and no journalist was admitted to follow the 
proceedings. The correspondents of l'Humaniterand the l'Unita'fourV 
no more favor in this respect than representatives of the bourgeois 
press and only the Komsomolskaya Pravda representative followed the 
proceedings. The fact is that the gOviet delegation had taken care 
70 include him in its ranks. 
It was out of the question to try to approach the 'delegates. Three 
successive control points had been arranged: two by the police, ?Tx at 
the entry of the Park of Culture, the other at the entries of the building 
where the sessions were held. The third control, at the very door of the 
meeting roam, was secured by Czechoslovakia students. The hotels where 
the delegates were lodged were kept under"very close surveillance." 
The reasons for such a closed door meeting are clear. The IUS, like 
other international organizations of the same type, are considered by 
the Soviet directors as a transmission belt for propagating their siDgans, 
their policies, and their ideology and to insure in return the support 
cftheir strategy. Thus it WAS of extreme importance to them that tie 
IUS should appear to be a bloc without cracks fully ranged behind their 
line. If confrontations were foreseen --- and they were --- it was 
necessary to prevent their becoming public -: "Unity" reappeared in 
tle sphere of resolutions, which were adopted in a mechanical fashion 
(there were 125 of them!) by an absolute majority. 
Fabricating a Majority 
The first task is to insure such a. majority. It is an undertak_ng 
lure and more difficult despite the variety of means employed and the 
lick of scruples in using them. Thus certain delegations, like that froth 
tie Congo-Kinshasa, were turned back on their arrival at the airfield. 
Oilers, as was the case of the representative of the Greek students of 
the interior, were able to get as far as the hotel but were expelled the 
day before the Opening of the proceedings. For others, the UNEF [French 
Student Union] and the delegations from Guadeloupe and Martinique, ertry 
vLsas were simply refused by the embassies or consulates. As for the 
Guatemala and Hdnduran. delegations, the organizers simply "forgot" to 
send them their:air tickets two fa

Added to these radical measures were police provocations such as 
those to which two Belgian delegations became victim the very night of 
their arrival. Arrested at their hotel, then taken to the police station, 
they were interrogated for four hours continuously on the pretext that 
an automobile registered in Belgium was supposed to have distributed 
in the streets of the city pamphlets "hostile to the Czechoslovakia 
people." Finally released, they escaped from the interrogation only 
by the threat that their delegation would raise the matter at the Congress 
itself. The Czechoslovak authorities apologized, and that was that.... 
Singular Practice  
To cap it all, the credentials committee did its job. Thus it 
classified among the "observers" two delegations which were not only 
members in good standing of the IUS but actual members of the secretariat: 
the VVS of Belgium and the FUA of Argentina. It should be added that 
the executive committee, which had met some weeks before the Congress, 
had been convoked under totally irregular circumstances: Madagascar, for 
example, had not been given a chance to attend. 
There is nothing surprising in these anti-democratic practices, in 
these manipulations. The new fact --- and an important one --- is that 
they met with considerable opposition within the Congress. On the second 
day, some ten delegations (Argentina, Mexico, Spain, Salvador, Ireland, 
Belgium (Walloons and Flemish), Federation of Students of Black Africa 
in France, and Malagasy students in France) protested to the Congress 
presiding board in a joint resolution. They presented eight questions 
concerning the facts which we have detailed above, and showed moreover tha 
a quorum had not even been assembled for the Congress to be able to 
deliberate validly. 
The presiding board of the Congress (it was installed without being 
elected, on the pretext that the directors of the IUS --- Czechoslovakia, 
Sudan, Iraq --- assume it traditionally) didn't bother to given an answer 
to these questions. To the contrary, throughout the proceedings the 
board tried to prevent the dissidents from speaking. It should be added, 
to understand the attitude of the Iraq and Sudan delegates --- and it is 
true for the majority of the Arab countries and for a number of African 
countries --- that this was a matter of students who were studying in 
the USSR, in the GDR, Poland, Hungary or in Czechoslovakia. 
A, particularly significant incident took place during the Congress 
ratification of the Credentials Committee report. The first protest 
arose concerning the fact that the delegates were confronted with a 
SO-page Committee report five minutes before the discussion was opened. 
But theiivelist exchange took place concerning the representativeness 
of the two opposing Argentine delegations. The 5 December F.U.A. 
(the date of its Congress) represents 60 university centers out of 69.

Party, born of a schism in the Argentine CP. The 15 November F.U.A. 
represents only nine university centers. But as it is composed of 
orthodox Conmunists, it was vehemently supported by the delegations 
of the East European countries. The discussion of a motion by the ' 
Cuban delegation --- providing for sending a committee to Argentina 
to determine the real representativeness of each of the rival organiza ions 
--- was interrupted because the simultaneous translation facility 
opportunely broke down, and that happened at the level of the Soviet 
delegation. This "technical accident" was used to advantage for "visi 
of the East European delegation to the Cubans. But the latter upheld 
their motion, which was adopted. Despite this vote a USSR representat 
saw fit to accuse the F.U.A. of anti-Sovietism. The Argentine delegat s 
in a mark of protest, then left the Congress. But they did it to the 
applause of a certain number of delegations and were accompanied to th 
exit by the Spanish delegates. 
A Political Battle  
Behind these bitter procedural skirmishes, it was evident that a 
political battle was developing. The divergency appeared with special 
clarity at the time of the general discussion, and in fact when the 
order of business was discussed. Thus the Spanish proposal to set up 
a committee for studying the struggle of students in West Eurdpe and 
in the higher developed capitalist countries was rejected by the'Sovie 
Bloc. 
Similarly rejected was an amendment, also Spanish, proposing the 
addition, as the first order of business, among the task of the IUS th 
Struggle "for national and social liberation" (the text says merely: 
"the struggle against imperialism"). In contrast, by a vote of 21 
(Spain, Romania, Korea, Cuba, North Vietnam, Yugoslavia, et al.) again t 
18 (USSR and others), an amendment was adopted affirming international 
student solidarity with the anti-imperialistic struggle of the Arab 
peoples and students, and especially with the struggle of the Palestin an 
peuple and students. Similarily, the Soviets opposed in vain a Cuban 
amendment denouncing imperialist penetration of the universities. 
Brought for consideration by several delegates in the course of 
general discussion --- Romania, Japan (Zengakuren), Spain, Madagascar 
Black Students in France, etc. --- was the very nature of the IUS 
(yureaUcratic organization), its policy (the anti-imperialist struggle 
was defined only in a narrow and superficial way) and its practical 
activity (solidarity is expressed only in words or telegrams). In pla e 
of this concept, the dissidents proposed the IUS as a true center of 
information and exchange of experience, a center for coordination of 
struggles and of genuine solidarity. 
The unfolding of the proceedings reveal existence existence against 
the Soviet BlOc:of a regrouping of several delegations (Spain, Mexico

Africa in France Madagascar) supporte

Japan, Venezuela, and, on several occasions in the course of the voting, 
by Cuba and North Vietnam. The events of the last day -- at the time 
of the "election" of the directing organs --- demonstrated the gravity 
of the crisis in the IUS. The single list method of elections provoked 
lively protest from several delegations (notably Venezuela and the 
Dominican Republic). It also provoked the spectacular withdrawal of 
the Spanish delegation from the Congress.

s'opposaient. La F.U.A. di-

10 April 1971 
"Animation" But No Thigh-Slapj)ing  
A Few Anecdotes Culled From the 24th Party Congress 
CPYRGHT 
Insrow?Thp delegates to the 24th Con-
gress of the Soviet Comthunist Party heard 
Leonid Brezhnev's central committee report 
with "joyful, excitement," Sharaf Rashidov 
of Uzbekistan announced the other day. 
Joy, excitement, color, even humor have 
been hard for Western eyes to find in the 
excerpts of the congress proceedings vouch-
safed by the press agency Tass, newspapers 
and Soviet television. They were certainly 
conspicuous by their absence from the faces 
of leaders s:town on television tapes of Pre-
mier Alexei Xosygin delivering his lengthy 
report on the new five-year plan Tuesday. 
Party leader Brezhnev sat writing; ideolo-
gist Mikhail Sitslov appeared to be reading a 
magazine; Politburo. member Gennady Vo-
ronov tapped a pencil; Mstislav Keldysh, 
president of the Academy of Sciences, 
gnawed his thumb. When the camera 
panned over the mass of delegates, several 
were caught glancing at their watches. 
Real emotion was visible, however, in the 
closing moments of the Congress Friday. 
Brezhnev choked up while he was still speak-
ing and the te1evision showed tears in his 
eyes as the delegates sang "The Interna-
tionale," which is still the par,ty?though not 
the state?anthem. Other leaders on the 
dais were wiping their eyes, too. 
rv.s 
EARLIER, Tass seemed to feel an occa-
sional need to try to put some gaiety into 
its reports. 
One congress speaker was a weaver 
named A. V. Smirnova from the Yakovlev-
sky flax mill in Ivanova Region, northeast of 
Moscow. Among other things, she told So-
viet writers, pPinters and filtn-makers that 
they should put more textile workers into 
their creations. 
"You know how many good songs have 
been composed about girl spinners who in 
olden times worked in small, dark rooms. 
But now my contemporaries who have 
clever fingers and ardent hearts, intelligent 
and beautiful, are not given worthy atten-
tion .by poets and . composers," Mrs. Smir-
nova said. 
Toss reported "animation in the .hall."

counted how quick excerpts, reported only ap. counted how his Marxist government had re-

The interpreter put only the mention of, 
boy, the Soviet establishment novelist, last Cuba into Russian, and the audience, duly 
Saturday. 
He denounced the Austrian "right-sving re-
visionist," Ernst Fischer, as an opponent of 
Socialist realism in the arts. Tass carefully 
noted that "Fischer" is the German word for 
"fisherman" before' reporting that Sholok-
hov said, "This fisherman and other foreign 
anglers are trying to cast their lines with 
quite rotten flies, banking on catching as 
many gullible carp as possible with this bait 
in the muddy waters of the so-called realism , 
.without riverbanks." This, too, produced 
"animation In the hall." 
Sholokhov then added that there were too 
few gullible carp in the Soviet arts pond, so 
the "clever" anglers would pull out only 
small fry. The record then noted both ap-
plause and laughter. 
NJ, 
SATURDAY was a big day for congres-
sional humor: Foreign Minister Andrei Gra 
rnyko deadpanned a bureaucrat's joke in his 
foreign policy speech, unreported bY Tass. 
After recounting the foreign policy activi. 
ties of the Politburo, central committee, Su-
preme Soviet and government, Gromyko 
said, "Our Soviet diplomacy is also fulfilling 
Its duty as helper of the party and govern-
ment. I almost said our army of diplomats, 
but then I remembered that the appropriate 
personnel offices might pick on it, which 
might be bad for us guys." 
Pravda recorded applause but no laughter 
at this sly reference to bureaucracy's pe-
rennial interest in reducing "surplus" per, 
sonnel lists. 
Significantly, nobody has reported hearing. 
any good "anecdotes" mocking the congress 
? the true SOViethumor that produced doz-
cued to applaud all references to the gallant 
Caribbean ally, burst out clapping. 
Corvalatt did not realize that the Inter-
preter had deprived Peking of equal time. 
He looked 'surprised, since he knew that 
many speakers had been applauded for at-
tacking Peking. But in one of the few spon-
taneous actions by a congress speaker,' he. 
decided that if his listeners liked it, he 
would give it to them again. , 
He repeated that Santiago had recognized 
Cuba and China. This time, according to 
Western Communists who were in the Pal-
ace of Congresses, the interpreter slowly in-
cluded China in his translation. The audi-
ence, finally clued in, sat on its hands. Cor-
valan looked quizzical and continued.

June 1971 
THE TWO FACES OF "DISSIDENT" COMMUNISTS 
In commenting -on the "negative phenomena" of revisonism and 
nationalism in the international Communist movement, Brezhnev 
in his address to the Congress singled out for specialcensure 
Roger Garaudy of France, Ernst Fischer of Austria, and Teodoro 
Petkoff of Venzuela_ They have all been read out of their parties. 
Their sin is not only to sneak out against various Soviet faults 
and malpractices but to do so consistently, regardless of the 
occasion. In this sense they may be regarded as true dissidents. 
BreZhnev did not go on to condemn Berlinguer and other Italian 
Communist leaders, Marchais of the French Communist Party, Carrillo 
of the Spanish Communist Party, Aarons of the Australian CP, and 
a host of.others, who also have from time to time criticized Soviet 
policies, particularly the invasion and "normalization" of 
Czechoslovakia- Such leaders have learned the limits of tolerable 
criticism of the Soviet Union and deserve to be called pseudo-dissie 
dents, as their behaviour at the 24th CPSU Congress illustrates. 
The 24th Party Congress showed that leaders of Communist 
parties of the world need considerable agility to walk their fine 
opportunistic line in trying to satisfy two conflicting political 
requirements, those of their Moscow Losses and those of the home 
electorate -- they bow to the bosses and try to deceive the homefront. 
The 24th CPSU Congress, held in Moscow from 30 March to 10 April, 
heard most foreign party delegates speak in innocuous cliches, 
concealing far more than they revealed of the divisions they have 
expressed between themselves and the CPSU. All pledged allegiance 
to proletarian internationalism (that Communist euphemism for 
submission to Soviet-dictated policies). Many who have for years 
vigorously claimed to oppose Soviet foreign policy and Soviet - 
dominance, extolled the vietues of both. After the Congress, the 
Communist and non-Communist populace may not have noticed the 
degrading spectacle of some delegations scurrying home to reassert 
their nationalism, independence, and their anti-Soviet positions 
which were to prove to local suporters that they didn't really 
mean what they said at the Congress! 
There are two mutually supporting explanations for this 
paradoxical behaviour. There is good reason to believe that the 
Soviets used various devices to control the expression of dissent

Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000300090001-4 
by delegates to the Congress, including some manner of censorship of 
"objectionable" passages in the speeches of visiting delegates. 
But since leaders seem not to have complained about any Soviet 
tampering with their speeches or about Soviet pressure on them, 
they in effect acquiesced in Soviet demands that there be no 
criticism at the Congress, Then, back home, they tried to mend any. 
damage done to the sensibilities of their constituencies by 
reiterating their earlier "principled" criticism, As a matter of 
political expediency, they play the game two ways in the face of 
conflicting political requirements. When in Moscow, that fountain-
head Of money, organizational support and ideology, each Party makes 
obeisance to the CPSIJ Back home it changes the mask to appear in 
the guise most pleasing to its supporters who are their only hope 
Of reaching political power_ All the bravewords about autonomy, 
separate roads to socialism, and disapproval of Russian militarism 
are necessary at home in order to reassure any-fellow countrymen 
who mayhave heard the party leaders in Moscow declaring themselves 
in liege to a foreign power. 
This dichotomy of behaviour, in and out of Moscow, which can 
be illustrated in numerous instances, is particularly clear in the 
following three examples: 
George Marchais, Acting Deputy Secretary General of the Soviet-
line Communist Party of France (PCF), declared in Moscow that 
"proletarian Internationalism_ is a sacred duty," Not a Word about 
the political trials- in Czechoslovakia which Husak promised not to 
hold and Marchais promised to denounce, Instead he praised the 
"cOnstant struggle waged by the CPSU and the Soviet state for the 
independence of oppressed peoples," Even before the Congress had 
adjourned he scrambled back on the right side of his own constituency 
by declaring to:the French Communist daily L'Humanit6 that his 
delegation "had not thought it wise," as guests of the Soviet 
leadership, to mention their "well known and unchanged" position 
toward military "intervention" in Czechoslovakia, In fact, he said, 
Czedi servility at the Congress embarrassed the French Party! 
Marchais told L'Humanite he "regretted" as "alien" to PCF principles 
Husak's abject adfhission to the world Communist movement gathered 
at the Congressthat the Soviet military intervention was after all 
a fraternal act in response to the "request" of Czechoslovakia, 
If Marchais' reproach of Husak were anything but an opportunistic 
tactic, Marchais would have expressed his 'regrets" before his world 
Communist audience at the Congress, 
The largest non-ruling Communist Party of them all, the 
Italian Communist Party (PCI), feels itself closest to that charmed 
circle of government and is therefore in greatest need of the facade

vociferous in denouncing the Czech invasion and occupation and the 
Stalinist management of Poland which led to the 1970 riots. But 
all these critical judgments, which have the ring of sincerity in 
PCI publications, were left outside the door of the 24th Congress. 
None of the Soviet delegates or the 101 delegations ftaM 99 
countries heard a word of disagreement or disapproval from Deputy 
Secretary General Enrico Berlinguer. He did not mention the fate 
of Czechoslovakia or the Brezhnev Doctrine which requires Czech-
type treatment for any Communist regime which the Soviets deem to 
be practicing the very reforms that the PCI calls- for from the 
safety of non-Communist Italy. 
Berlinguer returned to Rome before the Congress adjourned. 
There he said defensively in exact if unconsious imitation of 
Miarchais, that the PCI's views on problems due to "Czech events" 
were "already well known'.' He assured his audience also that the 
PCI is "for a line of complete independence" and then their "path 
toward socialism.., will necessarily be different from those which 
other socialist countries have pursued..." (L'Uhita, 8 April, attached) 
The Australian Communist Party (CPA) _hag, been a persistent 
and outspaen critic of Soviet paicies, particularly on Czech-
oslovakia. It has gone so far as to refuse to sign the June 1969 
declaration of the World Communist Conference and has even invited 
the renegade Frenth Communist Roger Garaudy to'address its members, 
But National Secretary Laurie Aaron's speech to the 24th Congress 
contained nothing about the Czech tragedy. He mentioned none of 
the CPA-CPSU differences over the latter's domination in the name 
of proletarian internationalism, he said nothing df the hated 
Brezhnev Doctrine which he has frequently ctititized. The Soviet 
Party may have assured his silence by threatening to split the CPA 
as Aarons himself predicted they might do. Thus, like the other 
leaders, Aarons seems to have one party line for Moscow and another 
for the home crowd. But available accounts in the CPA daily (see 
attached) are equally innocuous and do not reiterate "well-known 
CPA positions," but do contrast drathatically With Aarons' ptevious 
criticisms. 
Whether the Communist and non-Conmunist populace of the various 
countries is fully aware of the extent of self-serving hypocrisy 
practiced by their Mbscow-ridden CPs is debatable. But it certainly 
has not escaped Soviet attention. At the opening session of the 
Congress, Brezhnev expressly warned the Parties against going too 
far and making too many compromises in order to win parliamentary 
power. Certain renegades, he said, show themselves as anti-Soviet 
in order to be declared "real Marxists" and thus fully independent. 
Although most parties are beyond the reach of Soviet arms and thus 
of the consequences of the Brezhnev Doctrine, few could survive in

AT THE CONGRESS  
Excerpts from speech to the 24th CPSU Congress by Georges Mhrchais, 
Acting Secretary General of the French Communist Party on 31 March 1971: 
"Dear comrades, I bring to the 24th CPSU Congress the warm greetings 
of the PCF and of its general secretary, Comrade Waldeck Rochet. Like 
every one of your party's congresses, this 24th congress is an impor-
tant event for the communist and international movement.. But it is 
also an event of great interest for world opinion as a whole. This is 
so because your party, which has made triumph the ideals of the Paris 
Commune, whose centenary we have just celebrated, was the first to lead 
the socialist revolution to victory and to create the first socialist 
state in history. This is so because since that time the activity of 
the CPSU and the Soviet state has played a determining role in the 
service of socialism and peace in the evolution of the contemporary. 
world. This role is due first of all to the economic successes and 
the total achievements whose balance sheet is being convincingly presented 
at your congress and of which the Communist Party and the Soviet people 
can be proud. But your congress also attracts attention because it is 
resolutely turned toward the future. Comrade Brezhnev's report is 
,permeated with the idea that the communists do not and cannot remain in 
the same place, that it is always necessary to advance with an acute 
sense of what is new and with creative initiative.... 
"...anti-Sovietism, no matter in what form it presents itself and no 
natter where it originates, constitutes a crime against the interest 
of the working class and the peoples. We are combating it and will con-
tinue to combat it with ever increasing vigor.... 
"Dear comrades, bonds of brotherhood, solidarity, and cooperation 
have always existed between the PCF and the CPSU, and no trial has ever 
been able or will ever be able to sever them. We are determined to 
further consolidate, to consolidate ceaselessly, the relations between 
our two parties, which are rightly called fraternal parties....We attach 
great importance to the principle of the independence and sovereignty of 
all parties and to our principles being respected in our relations with 
fraternal parties. But at the same time, we believe that proletarian 
internationalism, the joint action of all the communist parties on a 
Marxist-Leninist basis, is a sacred durty and, indeed, the prerequisite 
for the success of our struggle.... 
"Long live the 24th CPSU Congress! Long live the friendship, solidarity, 
and cooperation between the PCF and the CPSU!... 
,,Long live the united action of all the workers and peoples struggling 
against imperialism! Long live communism!"

Lmax Leon interview wizn ueorges Aarenalb In MVSUUWm 1 Avvi1 19(1] 
[Text] PCF Deputy Secretary General Georges Marchais, who is leading the French Com-
munist Party delegation to the 24th CPSU Congress, was kind enough to comment for 
L'HUMANITE on some aspects of the work now in progress at the Palace of Congresses. 
Here are his answers to our questions: .1 
Question: What are the initial impressions of our party's delegation after the first 
3 days of the congress? 
Answer: So far we have been Mainly impressed by the emphasis put on the prospects for 
improving the living stanaard and increasing the prosperity of the Soviet peoPle, 
emphasis apparent both In the report submitted by L. BroZhnev,and.in the speeches of 
-
Most of the delegates. Obviously this is their main concern and it will leave its mark 
on the next 5-year period. 
L. Brezhnev's report ha.a also stressed that the main activities of the CPSU concerning 
the organization of society were directed at "develogng socialist demoeracy? in all its 
aspects, 
? 
AIM have also noted with great interest thenew purpose marking the approadh to economio.:... 
and social questtAns. Of course the production ratios mid the econoMic laws of Soviet 
spoiety are essentially the same as 40 years ago?that is, of a socialist type--but 
the standard.reaehad by this sooialist society is now considerably higher.. -This, creates 
new problems which require new solutions. I shall mention only. one of these problems 
as an example, a problem which has justly been described in the report as being of 
"historic significanoe." I refer to the question oecombihing the scientific and 
technological revolution with the advantages of the 'socialist economic system: The 
opportunities afforded in this sphere are boundless. 
What the congress has brought out even now is a clear and passionate reaffirmation of 
the Soviet Union's Will for peace. The, proposals formulated or renewed by the Soviet 
Union in this sphere can only insure the support of all men and women aspiring to peace, 
security, and disarmament. 
And finally, we cOMpletely agree with the idea expressed in the report on the activities 
of the CPSU Central Committee that the cohesion and the unity in action of the world 
communist movement is a complex but especially imperative task at a time when the : 
imperialistslare intensifying their aggressive activities against the freedom-loving 
peoples. 
Question: Al]. observers have noted that the number of foreign delegations participating 
in the congress has been larger than ever before, ShOUld any special significance 
,be attached to that fact? 
Answer: Absolutely. Over 100 delegations from communist parties and patriotic and 
revolutionary organizations are present. 
This representation is due to the great prestige enjoyed by the. CPSU among the workers 
ar peopleB Of all olontinents.

8ut we believe that it is also the to the will or the communist parties to present a 
united front in the struggle against imperialism, irreepective, of some differences , 
of opinion. m, 
Well) this is an idea dear to the French comeunisto. 
Obviously, We believe that more, an be no unity without principles. our *trona aimatil 
at the unity of the entire world communist movement go hand in hand with our continual 
struggle on two fronts: against rightist opportunism and against leftist opportunism. 
We recalled this yesterday in our greetings to the congress. 
having said this, our. 19th congress has emphasized that neither any differences in . 
.the conditions under which the struggle is waged nor the very existence of differences 
concerning some problems must weakem or hinder in any way the necessary unity of 
action of all the communist parties. 
;It was with this in Mind and in-order to avoid any polemics that, in accordance with 
its mandate, our delegation decided to-avoid recalling, in its greetings to the 
congress of a fraternal party of which it is a guest, the well-known and unchanged 
attitude of the PCP ta,the August 1968 military intervention in Czechoslovakia. 
Obviously, every delegation says what it wants but our delegation believes it 
regrettable Cha'rihe CPCZ delegation has thought fit to devote the main part of its 
greetings to an .eXpose of its views on this problem, an exposd several aspects of' 
which impliea-criticisms of our own attitude. 
shall add with parti.ellar reference to the questien of the sovereignty of the 
socialist state that the thesis formulated by the Czechoslovak delegation seems to 
us alien to the principles .jointly determined by the'communist parties in the state-
ment issued by the June 1969 Moscow conference. 
For our part, wd are firmly adhering to these principles. 
Speaking in more general terms, we shall pursue our efforts with perseverance, calm, 
and patience, ethert-e-aimed at unity of action of all communist parties on the basis 
both of the indet;endence,of every party and of proletarian internationalism.

From ANATOLE SNUB, Paris, April 2 
The French Communist Party 
leader, M. Georges Marchais 
today rebuked attempts at the 
Soviet ,Party Congress in Mos-
cow to justify the invasion of 
Czechoslovakia in August 1968. 
In an interitiew with 
"L'Humanite," he attacked the 
Czechoslovak leader,'Mr Husak, 
for raising the question at the 
CIngress. 
M. Marchais said the French 
delegation at the congress had 
not thought it wise, as guests of 
the Soviet leadership, to recall 
" the well known ? and 
unchanged" positien of tho 
French party toward the Rus-
sian "military intervention." 
ITherefore, French Communists 
regretted that Mr Husak had 
devoted most of his speech to 
the subject. 
"Several aspects" of Mr 
Husak's speech, "implied a 
criticism of our own position.'% 
Furthermore, Mr Husak's justi-
fication of the Soviet interven-
tion "appears to us alien to the 
principles defined together" at 
the Moscow conference of Com-
munist Parties dn June 1969.

AT THE CONGRESS  
Excerpts from speech by Italian Communist Party Deputy Secretary General 
Enrico Berlinguer at the 1 April session of the 24th CPSU Congress. 
"Dear Comrades, I bring you, delegates at the 24th CPSU Congress, and 
all Soviet comrades, the fraternal greetings of Italian communists and 
of the Secretary General of our party, Comrade Luigi Longo. 
To the communists and to all peoples of the Soviet Union, we express 
the sincere hope that the decisions of this, your congress, may advance 
in all fields your socialist society and the building of the material 
and technical basis of communism. It is noteworthy that in the economic 
5-year plan which has just begun there is expressed the aim to achieve 
a substantial increase in the material and cultural living standard of 
the Soviet peoples. This appears to be.an_important sign. We know that 
this effort for a further economic mansion is accompanied by the 
growing aid of the Soviet Union to all those peoples who are fighting 
for their own independence and freedom, in the first place to the heroic 
people of Vietnam and the Arab countries. All this indicates not only 
the scope and solidarity of the victories already achieved as*viell as the 
immense potential of your socialist society, but also the fundamental 
contribution made by the Soviet Union to the defense of world peace and 
the building of a world free from imperialism, hunger, and war. 
"Our solidarity with your party, with the Soviet Union, with all 
socialist countries, has always remained alive and active. Our interna-
tional solidarity does not and cannot mean our full identification with 
the choices which each socialist country, and more generally each 
communist and workers party, has made and is making on its own responsi-
bility, but it means a basic solidarity with a country such as your own, 
with the other socialist countries, with a whole world which, through 
its own existence and victories, has already changed the fate of mankind. 
"Our internationalism is founded on the recognition of the full 
independence of each country and each party and leaves the way open, as 
has already happened and as can always happen, to moments and circumstances 
cf dissension and divergence, without in any way, as a result of this, 
weakening solidarity and duty in the struggle for the great aims which 
unite us. 
"In the course of a long and difficult progress, our party has put 
down deep roots among the working masses of the Italian people. It 
has, emerged as an important national force. From Lenin, first of all, 
and then from Gramsci and Togliatti, we have received the teaching which 
has shown us haw.to fight to open for our people a path toward socialism 
which correspond to the particular historic, social, and political

conditions of our country, as well as the conditions in which there 
develops conCretely the world struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism. 
"We are also seeking to state .the major outlines of the socialist 
state which we wish to build in Italy, together with the contribution 
of the other forces of the working class and the people. It is obvious 
that even on the general problems of socialism, of socialist thought and 
of the international workers movement, our party, while it is attentively 
studying the results of the practical and theoretical work of other parties, 
is working to make its own specific contributions, arising from its own 
experience and ideas. At the same time, we firmly reject any solicitations 
to break or weaken our internationalist duty within the great world 
revolutionary communist movement of which we are part and of which we 
will always be part, as a result of a free choice made by us on the basis 
6c Marxist-Leninist principles by which we are inspired and on the basis 
of the deepest interests of the working class and our people. Within 
this framework, we have fought and we will always fight any manifestation 
of anti-Sovietism...."

PCI Deputy General Secretary Enrico Berlinguer statement on CPSU congress 
....At the congress, Berlinguer added, we had the opportunity of 
noting once again the existence of assessments which were different from 
our own on certain important questions concerning the international 
workers movement, relations between communist parties, and the develop-
ment of socialist thought. It is not only a matter of problems raised 
by the Czechoslovak events, our positions on those are already well known, 
but also of more general questions like, for example, the one relating 
to the necessity of full respect for the independence of every party, 
every state,? and every socialist state, which remains a fundamental 
question for us. 
"Our line is clear, and we have confirmed it at every point: We 
are in favor, of a strong internationalist commitment, side by side with 
all the socialist countries, communist parties, add anti-imperialist 
forces. 
"At the same time, we are for a line of complete independence both 
with regard to the struggle and the quest which we are conducting in 
Italy for a path toward socialism and for a socialist building -- which

are and will necessarily be different from those which other socialist 
countries have pursued and are pursuing -- and with regard to the judgment 
of and the way in which we are operating within the great international 
alinement to which we belong. 
"This remains the substance of our position. We are aware that 
our enemies would prefer to be faced by a PCI which is a servile imitator , 
of other models and devoid of the capacity to.autahomously formaate and 
defend a policy of its own or else by a PCI wiiiEh has ceased to be an 
internationalist force. 
"Instead, autonomy and internationalism are and will remain inseparable 
aspects of our way of operating within the reality of our country and of

from this line in one direction or another will always be deluded. 
"Regarding the speculations and falsifications made recently, it is 
only necessary to repeat that UT communists are certainly not seeking 
the applause or recognition of our opponents: What we are interested in 
is that the substance of our positions should be understood by the 
workers, the democratic forces, and all earnest people."

L'UNITA interview with PCI Politburo member Gian-Carlo Pajetta on 24th 
cODORAIK-Ts. 
"Comrade Gian-Carlo Pajetta, who was a member of the PCI delegation 
w.liCh attended the 24th CPSU Congress, has granted us the following 
interview on its proceedings and results. 
"Question: Would you first give, us a general opinion on the congress? 
"...Comrade Berlinguer has already expressed a first opinion in his 
interview on returning from Mbscow. We have had a report in the party 
d_rectorate, we will widely disseminate the documents which have been 
published recently, and we will continue the debate and the study at 
party meetings and in confrontations with others. Odrs is a positive 
opinion, at the same time, it also aims at a critical-eXdminatidn-bf-a 
fundamental experience. We do not want a description '5raft adVertisement 
of some kind of a 'model,' as if we had attended an international 
elibition and as if we were faced with the problem of importing a finished 
product to be used here in our country.

"Question: 'Returns' and 'rehabilitations' had been expected. 
Have these fore-Casts been confirmed? 
"Answer: I believe that for an opinion on the congress and on the 
prospects which it opens it is necessary to go back to the debate which 
'A.as been going on almost everywhere in recent months and to which such 
great amount of space has been devoted in the international press. 
Ale remember, for example, the reverberations caused by a question put 
to a West European communist party leader about his reaction were the 
24th congress 'to disavow the 20th' and how his answer that 'in this 
:ase, his party would not approve it' seemed courageous and aroused 
sensation. 
"Question: Could you tell us something about the way in which the 
oroblems of the articulation of society and of the economic and social 
development were presented? 
"Answer: A Central Committee document appeared on the eve of the 
congress which stresses the function of the Soviets and provides a more 
specific base to their greater autonomy by means of greater powers in 
the economic field and by means of more conspicuously autonomous budgets. 
At the congress, and particularly in Brezhnev's and Kosygin's reports, 
there was no lack of references for workers' participation and democratic 
life, also seen as prerequisites for greater efficiency, references 
which were intentionally accompanied by appeals for discipline and 
organizational efficiency. Thus, although the theme of the trade unions 
was certainly not a central one, the reference made to them did not 
stop -- as some people believed they could simplify it -- at the 
'transmission belt' formula but stressed their duty to represent and to 
defend the interests of the workers. 
"It is not possible to speak about a turn and perhaps not even about 
a deepening in connection with the themes of democracy and of the insti-
tutions The intention here was to stress the continuity, but recalling 
that this means a condemnation of theillegalities of the 'personality 
cult' period and a desire to overcame what was arbitrary, improvised, 
and personal during the period of 'subjectivism.' 
"I intentionally refer to the two terms in quotation marks because 
the fact that complicated phenomena are being schematized and almost 
concealed by .a label appears to us as a limitation of research and 
political debate and therefore as a limitation of the congress. It is 
as if a kind of modesty (a dangerous political modesty, we believe) 
prevented a pore open political debate which would certainly be fruitful 
and would take place in the direction in which it was intended to move 
and in which things were moving. When a congress seems as if it were 
dominated by the concern for unanimity and for the proclamation of 
monolithism, a part of its effectiveness seems to become lost, as if the

meeting of experiences and the recognition of the problems were being 
tarnished by elements of liturgy. 
"This was felt perhaps in more than one speech, but it must be stated 
clearly that it was not a characteristic of the reports. At this point 
we must ask the reader to show an attentiveness which political observers 
seem to have lacked, particularly those who were concerned with providing 
a daily comment aimed at serving preconceived theses rather than pro-
viding information.... 
"The profound disagreement between the Soviet Union and China re-
mains like a painful wound in the international workers movement, and 
the polemical positions of the CCP also remain acute. The polemic was 
taken up again on the eve of the congress, and no one could hope for 
sensational gestures of pacification. Naw then, if there was an echo 
of the polemic and a sharp answer to the attacks at the CPSU congress 
and if the positive, albeit limited results in interstate relations were 
stressed, here also, although no progress was made, there was no move 
backward, nor has the conflict sharpened.... 
"The theme of the defense of the socialist countries was stressed, 
and there was a.return -- and no one could expect things to happen 
differently -- to insisting, even quite strongly, on the justification 
of Czechoslovakia's occupation. We have maintained and have declared 
and recalled in this respect a view point which did not come close to 
or offer any rapprochement. 
"Question: We would like you to examine finally the meaning and 
the value of the international representations at the 24th congress. 
"Well, we must say that the presence of 101 delegatiohs provides 
the answer, and in a direction which appears to us to be the right one. 
There were not only different organizations and countries with absolutely 
clIfferent curcumstances but also voices which, because they represented 
different situations and conditions, could not all have the same accent. 
We Italians stressed this in Berlinguer's speech and we spoke clearly, 
in our own way, and in our own style: That is, Italiana. interna-
tionalist at the same time. There was no lack of attention at the congress, 
nor of stimulation for the debate and the confrontation, even in the 
many meetings which took place between various delegations.... 
"When we were among Soviet workers and soldiers, even with other 
delegations, one thing always seemed clear to everyone: It was useless 
to ask us to be different from what we are, but it was impossible to 
doubt the internationalism of the Italian communists. Unity in diversity: 
Perhaps not everyone says it and admits it, but for everyone this is a 
fact to be accepted. When I was asked to speak about our party's policy 
to students from every part of the world who were gathered in their 
university, no one thought that a voice which, perhaps, would not repeat 
the same words included in their textbooks could be inopportune.

unspecified] 
:Text] Dear comrades: Australiats communists greet the working people of the Soviet 
Inion on the occasion of the 24th CPSU Congress, an important event in the life of 
ioUr country. (applause). We wish great successes to the congress and to all the workers, 
kolkhoz members, and representatives of the intelligentsia, who, at the price of their 
'leroic labor and privations over the past 53 years, have transformed their motherland, 
iespite the embittered hostility of imperialism and some aggressive wars. (applause) 
%t the 24th CPSU Congress plans are being discussed which provide for new achievements 
in the"sphere of industry, agriculture seience, and culture, the raising of the living 
standard of the working people, and for the development of socialist democracy. 
Following Lenin's traditions of proletarian internationalism, the 24th CPSU Congress 
has again confirmed the readiness of the Soviet people to give support to the national 
liberation struggle of all peoples of the world ggainst American imperialism. The 
peoples of Indochina, who are heroically resisting the U.S. imperialists and its 
puppets and satellites, are in the vanguard of this worldwide movement. (applause) 
The remarkable victories won by the peoples o7 Indochina in the struggle against all 
the military and technical might of the United States immeasurably strengthen the 
struggle of all the peoples for liberty. (applause) .J 
The Australian Communist Party ppposes the capitalist class of its own country, which 
.s,willingly playing the role of ponfederate of the United States in its aggressiv.e 
war against the peoples of Indochina. This is our international duty and, at the same 
7ime, a main factor in the preparation for revol.utionary actions against Australian 
nonopoly capitalism and against American domination of political life, and 
'oreign policy of Australia. 
Che Australian communists are actively participating in the broad and ever growing 
antiwar mmvement. This coziitionbof different social and political forces is opposing 
'tar, demanding the withdrawal of all Australian and American forces and of military 
squipment from Indgehina, and is striving to prevent the drafting of young Australians 
into the army to wage this unjust war: (applause) At the same time, the Australian 
3ommunist Party is conducting its independent campaign by exposing imperialism as the 
nalprit for war,(and is supporting all popular forces fighting in Indochina. The com-
nunists support the proposals advanced by the DRV and the PRGRSV. (applause) 
Certain groups of more conscious -Australian workers are already waging strikes under the 
slogan, "No normal business life while the war lasts." In May adSeptember 1970 more 
than 120,000 people who went out onto the streets of the country's chief cities parti-
cipated in mighty protest demonstrations against the war. Together with other peace-
loving forces, the communists will do everything to involve as many people as possible 
in the most active forms of the antiwar actions. 
We consider it our dliti?flY7oppose primarily "our own' capitalism. (applause) We also 
'consider the struggll'against.Australials colonial pressure against the developing

In Australia we are striving to struggle against such ideas engineered by the capitalist 
system as racism, militarism, the sense of hopelessness and alienation, and against 
false moral values. Such ideas are the unseen force which cements the system of oppres-
sion in the developed capitalist countries. The theoretical and practical struggle 
against these bourgeois ideas is the main task of the Australian revolutionary movement. 
The workers movement in Australia is putting forward ,new demands and is devising new 
methodic of waging a struggle against the monopolies and for their economic, sooiel, and 
political demands. The growth of resistance to the attempts to transfer the burden of 
inflation and other difficulties of the capitalist economy to the shoulders of the 
workers And poorest strata of the population and also the growth of the movement of 
democratic rights to counteract the aspiration of the ruling classes to limit democracy 
even further are of particular significance. Reaction is preparing for an offensive 
for the purpose of stopping the strike movement of te workers, fettering the trade 
unions, disrupting demonstrations, and crushing the' protest movement against war and 
military rvice. 
We consider that there are prospects in Australia for developing the class struggle and 
ibr even greater fusion of the workers movement with the antiwar movement and the move-
ment for new moral .values, ma word, with those movements .which are fundamentally 
anticapitalist and can .issue a  socialist challenge to capitalist domination in Australia 
Comrades: The policy and practical activity of the CPSU are of enormous signifie 
canoe for the world revolutionary prodecc and have a positive influence on?the 
forward movement of all mankind.' We once again wish the congress success in all 
spheres. (stormy mm10.11.30)

relations began warming. The Arab-Israeli confrontation of 1967 
again brought Moscow and Belgrade closer together. A, year later, 
events in East Europe once more destroyed the tenuous Soviet-
Yugoslav rapprochement. 
5. The Dubcek regime in Prague made no secret of the fact 
that much of its inspiration came from the successes achieved in 
Belgrade with the Yugoslav brand of independent Communism. The 
Yugoslav press bespoke Belgrade's pleasure with developments 
in Czechoslovakia and many Yugoslav officials privately commented 
that the Czech experiment might even eclipse the accomplishments 
of Yugoslavia's self-management program which Prague was using 
as its model. In contrast to growing criticism of DUbcek's 
domestic reforms coming from Soviet, East German, and Polish 
media, in April 1968, Yugoslavia's Borba commented that "The 
process of democratization unfolding?TE?Czethoslovakia offers 
sufficient guarantee that its aims can be realized." 
Sovereignty Denied  
6. All indications are that the August 1968 invasion of 
Czechoslovakia caught the Yugoslays by complete surprise and in 
Yugoslav eyes, the Kremlin had again reverted to Stalinism and 
big-power Chauvinism. Yugoslavia saw an even more sinister threat 
in the post-invasion enunciation of the Brezhnev doctrine. This 
Soviet statement that the internal affairs of each member of the 
socialist fraternity were the direct concern of all other members, 
implied possible action against Romania, Yugoslavia's neighbor and 
the only Soviet bloc nation that supported Czechoslovakia and 
refused to participate in the invasion. Immediately after the 
occupation, there was a sudden increase in the number of East 
European "tourists" who cropped up in Yugoslavia. According to 
Belgrade these "tourists" were visiting for one purpose 
to collect intelligence on Yugoslav military preparedness, particularly 
in Macedonia. 
7. Adding to Yugoslav apprehensions were rumors of Soviet 
military maneuvers held during late August and early September 
along the Romanian border. At the same time, Bulgarian media 
began intensifying their agitation over the Macedonian question 
and the Bulgarian military newspaper echoed the Brezhnev doctrine 
with a warning by a Bulgarian deputy defense minister that Bulgaria 
was ready to go "anywhere else" to rescue socialism. The Soviet 
East German, Polish and Bulgarian press launched bitter attacks 
against Yugoslavia and against Tito personally, accusing him of 
having inspired the "revisionist" activity which had made the 
intervention in Czechoslovakia necessary.

8. By a series of actions --- some clandestine and some 
quite open!--- the Soviets have continued since August 1968 to 
bring pressure on Belgrade and to remind the Yugoslays of their 
vulnerability. The resultant Yugoslav antipathy for the Soviets 
has not abated and is still a prominent factor in Yugoslav 
thinking. In March 1969, President Tito had set the tone for 
the 9th Yugoslav Party Congress by reviewing the history of 
Soviet interference in Yugoslav affairs. By 1971, the atmosphere 
remained unchanged as Tito's May Day speech constantly harked 
back to danger from external enemies and several times cited 
foreign intelligence activities, noting that "especially recently 
we have felt incredible pressure." 
The Incredible Pressures  
9. Fresh instances of foreign meddling in internal Yugoslav 
affairs have come to light in the past few months.- First, a new 
species of Soviet-Yugoslav-agent emerged in the form of expatriates 
who had been studying in Soviet military academies at the time of 
the 1948 Soviet-Yugoslav rupture and who Chose or were pursuaded 
to stay on in the USSR. Many have readied the rank of major or 
colonel in the Soviet forces. One such was retired Soviet army 
colonel Nikola Grujic who was arrested in Belgrade in February 1970 
and Charged with, spreading propaganda hostile to the Yugoslav 
government, Grujic had previously been in and out of Yugoslavia 
on visits; he had been warned about making anti-regime statements, 
but refused to be muzzled. According to Tanjug and other Yugoslav 
press accounts of this incident, the Grujic case is far from being 
an isolated one. According to some Belgrade source, a number of 
these military expatriate tourists have been caught trying to 
recruit Yugoslays for the Soviet secret service (KGB). 
10. Yugoslav apprehensions were further sharpened in 1970 
with the exposure of a worrisome espionage case. In March, Hans 
Peter Ruhlmann a correspondnet of the West German weekly, Der Spiegel, 
was arrested with two Yugoslays and accused of a "criminal act of 
e-sTionage." The foreign country involved was not named, but 
infOrmed Yugoslav officials say that the case was run by East German 
intelligence with the undoubted complicity of the Soviet Union. 
Charged with RUhlmann were Hilmi Taci, Belgrade correspondent of 
Rilindija, an Albanian-language paper published in the traditionally 
nationalist region of Kosovo, and Jovan Turkulja, described as a 
"functionary of the military establishment." Immediately after the 
arrests, the East German embassy's press attach was suddenly 
called home.

11. The Ruhlmann investigation and trial, which lasted 
almost a year, culminated in a six-year sentence for Ruhlmann 
who was convicted of having procured from his Yugoslav collaborator 
highly secret materials which he then passed on to a "foreign 
government and a foreign organization as well as to two representatives 
of a foreign state." In late April 1971, the Yugoslav Supreme Military 
Court apparently decided the sentence, as it read, was far too 
ambiguous. The Supreme Court rejected the conviction handed down 
by the lower military court and returned the case with a demand for 
additional evidence and for the name of the foreign power involved. 
12. The 'Ullmann case had several ominous implications for 
Yugoslav officials in addition to simply raising questions about 
domestic loyalties in the face of apparent renewed Soviet-directed 
subversion. For one, the fact that an AlOanian was involved with 
Ruhlmann added weight to Yugoslav charges that the 1968 Kosovo 
riots were partially brought on by foreign meddling. The part 
played by Albanian propaganda in stirring up troubles was Obvious, 
but even in 1968 Belgrade was insisting that "other intelligence 
agencies" were behind the disorders. Since the 1968 riots, Kosovo, 
where economic depression and backwardness make the area easy prey 
for subversion, has been singled out for special attention in the 
current five-year plan. 
13. The Yugoslav leadership is not unaware of the close ties 
between East German intelligence and the Soviet KGB and assumes, 
that even if RUhlmann had not been working directly for the USSR, 
everything he got eventually ended up in Moscow. For the past 
two years, the Yugoslav press has repeatedly charged Moscow with 
meddling in her internal affairs. Official statements repeatedly 
imply that "hostile activity" is being carried out by those who 
most oppose Yugoslav self-management (the Soviets and the East 
Germans) and that the foreign adversaries involved are those most 
concerned about Yugoslavia's independent foreign policy (the Soviets 
and the East Germans). There has been press speculation that, by 
using the RUhlmann case, the Yugoslav courts plan to bring matters 
into the open and to document Soviet involvement in this and other 
espionage cases. 
Following the Fascists  
14. As noted in a recent article by Paul Lendvai, Vienna 
correspondent for the Financial Times of London: "It is an 
ominous sign that the extreme nationalist Croat exiles in the 
West now claim Soviet support and in their publications offered 
the Russians airports and harbor facilities on condition that 
Moscow guarantees an independent Croatia. If one adds the intense 
activity of Soviet agents in Serbia and Bosnia, it becomes clear 
that the Soviets are following in the footsteps of Mussolini's 
Fascist Italy, which successfully used Croatian separatism to 
destroy Yugoslavia."

15. The Yugoslays are convinced, and there is evidence to 
support their convictions, that Soviet duplicity is behind the 
recent activation of Croat chauvinism, especially abroad. Two 
public denials by Soviet spokesmen of Yugoslav allegations that 
the USSR Was encouraging if not helping emigre anti-Communist 
Croatian separatists are indicative of Soviet sensitivity to 
these Charges. Early in 1970, the Italian right-wing-BOr hese 
reported that Dr. Branko Jelic, a West Berlin physician an 
leader the extremist Croat "Council in Exile," had secretly 
conferred. in West Germany with several top level Soviets, an 
allegation officially denied by Moscow Pravda. It was, however, 
shortly after this alleged meeting that ac's newspaper began 
shifting from a staunchly - anti-Communist, anti-Soviet line to 
one favoring accommodation with the Soviet Union. 
16. Then, in April this year the Soviet Embassy in Stockholm 
protested against a report published in the Stockholm daily 
Dagens Nyheter concerning Moscow support given to the Ustashi. 
This is the Croatian extremist group that is held responsible 
for the 7:April murder of the Yugoslav ambassador to Sweden, 
Vladimir Rolovic. Ironically, before he was appointed to 
Stockholm., Rolovic was the assistant state secretary for foreign 
affairs whose job it was to prevent emigre terrorism and anti-
Yugoslav propaganda abroad. All of which leads to the assumption 
that RoloVic's assassination was a well calculated affair.* 
17. Dagens Nyheter's Zagreb correspondent, Lars Ake Berling, 
had referred in a 14 April story to rumors in Yugoslavia that the 
Soviets were supporting the Ustashi with the aim of causing enough 
trouble in Yugoslavia to give Moscow a pretext for invading the 
country after Tito's death. The Soviet Embassy said that "no 
honest person can entertain any doubts about the Soviet attitude 
toward the fascist terrorist organization Ustashi, whose members 
were in the service of the Hitlerite aggressors during World 
War II." According to some Belgrade sources, however, even 
within Yugoslavia the Soviets maintain contact with well-placed 
Ustashi elements. Reportedly, after World War II the Soviets got 
the namesof former Gestapo confidants, a few of whom now hold 
key posts in the government and whom the Soviets control by threat 
of blackmail. 
* The Western press has reported tnat the assassins of Rolovic were 
two Croat exiles. In fact, according to the Belgrade weekly, 
Nedeljne Informativne Novine (NEN), neither was an exile. Both 
Brajkovic and Barisic were born in Croatia, were traveling on 
Yugoslav passports, and both had arrived in Sweden as workers 
in January 1970.

18. What the Soviets have not officially denied is their 
possible role in the complete change of mind on the part of 
Dr. Brank)Jelic who in the past twelve months has become an 
ardent supporter of Moscow's policies. It is from the tenor 
of articles published during the past year in Jelic's newspaper 
Hrvatska Drzava (Croatian State) that evidence comes. In the 
latest, February-March 1971, issue of Jelic's paper, its 
ostensible Moscow correspondent, Slavko Novak, reported on 
a "recent" Warsaw Pact meeting which had confirmed "the Croatian 
area as an exceptionally important factor in the Warsaw Pact 
defense concept." Novak also reported a meeting of pro-Soviet 
Croat exiles in the USSR at width it was decided to "organize 
propaganda among the Croatian workers in Europe." According to 
Novak, Tito is being attacked by Moscow for trying to undermine 
its efforts in Egypt, for "whispering to Enver Hoxha not to 
accept the Soviet offer to normalize Soviet-Albanian relations," 
and for making efforts to pursuade Romania to abandon its policy 
of solidarity of the socialist bloc. Another article in the 
same issue promotes the concept of "Soviet Croatia" and a third 
is a piece designed to pursuade Albania to accept Moscow's offers 
for normalization. 
19. As sources in Zagreb point out, not all Croat emigr6s 
support Jelic's new pro-Soviet line; Croat Communists within the 
country are unalterably opposed to it. They see in Jelic's 
activities a dangerous game played against them; the strongest 
point of the Croat Communists has been their anti-Soviet line. 
It appears that the Soviets have not been able to infiltrate 
the Croat Communist Party and are therefore trying to find their 
allies among the Croat extremists abroad. In so doing Moscow 
seems to be following in Mussolini's footsteps, whose tactic was 
to use extreme Croat nationalism to 'destroy Yugoslavia and defeat 
the Serbs. In this instance, the Soviets would attempt to defeat 
the Croats and then support the Serbs against the Croats. 
Alarmism in the Press  
20. Derogatory statements by Soviet and some East European 
officials about "separate roads to socialism" in terms applicable 
to Yugoslavia have done little to calm Belgrade's nerves. Equally 
disquieting have been the most recent reflections in media of the 
Soviet Union and her "allies" which seem to presage a propaganda 
buildup stressing that Yugoslav socialism is in danger. For 
example, the 2 May issue of the Warsaw daily Zycie Warszawy claimed 
there were "alarming signs" regarding developments in Yugoslavia: 
"For some time now Yugoslavia's friends, concerned with the 
development of socialism, prosperity, and progress in that country, 
have watched with apprehension more and more frequent alarming signs."

Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000300090001-4 
It went on to blame the "Western press" for suggesting that 
the Worsening situation would push Yugoslavia from its present 
road and "open the door to penetration not only of revisionist 
but of openly capitalist forces." 
21. During late April, Radio Zagreb Commentator Milika Sundic 
had cause to criticize both the Soviet and Polish press for their 
distorted reporting of Yugoslav affairs. The Soviet Communist 
Party daily Pravda was accused of slanted reporting in its coverage 
of President-TIUTS speech in which he had announced an impending 
high-level meeting at which party unity and economic problems 
were to be discussed. Tito had said the meeting would not adjourn 
until matters had been settled. This was the end-of-April special 
Presidium session in Brioni out of which came agreement to maintain 
an ideologically unified Communist Party while going ahead with 
the formation of a radically decentralized government. 
22. Pravda's coverage of the Tito speech omitted all passages 
indicative 3T-3Ptimism and left the impression thatrthe'League-
of Communists of Yugoslavia had no prospects of success. "We are 
not so myopic," Sundic said, "that we cannot see that through its 
narrow selection Of information, Pravda wanted to suggest that 
socialism in our country is facing a major crisis and that it 
should be saved as it was in some other country." Sundic also 
denounced as fabrication an article in the Polish trade union 
daily, Glos Praqi, which said that separatist trends were on the 
increase in Croatia and noted that this was the sane argument 
being used by other supporters of a "doctrine of limited sovereignty." 
23. By way of contrast, 'Western press alarmism" is almost 
unanimous in its expression of faith that Tito can successfully 
manage a genuine succession and that in so doing, he will have 
made another great stride toward achieving a reasonably democratic 
Marxist society. As noted by The Economist of London (1 May): 
"...Tito will probably get his constitutional reform...If-he 
does succeed, there will be no rejoicing in Russia. The Russian 
leaders have long hoped to increase their influence in a weakened 
Yugoslavia after his death or retirement; and they have long 
feared the effect on their own subjects of liberalishig moves 
in other communist states. But his success will be very welcome 
everywhere else. President Nixon has recently shown his concern 
about Yugoslavia's future and his readiness to help it get over 
these difficult months. So have President Pompidou and Herr Brandt. 
They are doing it not because they cherish hopes of a capitalist 
Yugoslavia emerging after Tito; but because there is no visible 
and attractive alternative to his kind of reasonably stable, 
genuinely non-aligned Yugoslavia in that turbulent part of the 
world."

that the lenf er the Russians

nean, the st rer they are to 
insist on 1.); ses on the northern

The Yui os avs reason that

they will mei er be satisfied to

means one thing: The This-
CPYRGHT 
demanding a port and transit 
rights to reach it. 
, Furthermore, they don't 
really believe the demands 
will stop there. They are suspi-
cious enough to think that, 
sooner,, or later, the Russians 
will count on swallowing up 
the whole country. 
So the Tito government ex-
pects, when the time comes, to 
make clear that not a single 
Russian soldier will set foot on 
Yugoslav territory. If that 
means the Russians will re-
spond as they did in Czechoslo-
vakia, the Yugoslays will take 
the chance. 
And the thinking of Yugo-
slav ruling circles on Russian 
designs doesn't end there. This 
is a subject on which they are 
rich in explanations and inter-
pretations. 
They cite, for example, the 
rn 
Russian drive that dates from 
the early Czars to reach warm 
waters. Russia's attempts to 
reach the Adriatic through ter-
ritory that is now Yugoslavia 
were, in fact, among the prov-
ocations of World War I. 
They. cite also Russia's 
sense of military insecurity, 
which carries with it a need to 
dominate more and more sure 
rounding territory. At the 
same time they point out that 
I I t, 
so 1 
as leader of the world commu-
nist community, has not ad-
justed to Belgrade's course of, 
independence 
The Yugoslays say it is na-
ive to believe that current 
Russian leadership finds Tite's 
state less of an afront than 
Stalin did 20 years ago. If any-
thing, the Brezhnev doctrine 
which exalts Russia's right to 
intervene in the internal af-
fairs of any communist coun-
try is more threatening than: 
anything Stalin ever devised. 
Within the past year or two, ' 
intelligent Yugoslays have 
seen even further reason to 
beware of the Soviet threat. ; 
This begins with the obser-
vation that beneath the sur- , 
face, there is growing ferment 
mithin the Soviet Union, the 
consequence of diversion of 
massive funds from civilian to 
military purposes. 
The Russians have extrava-
gent programs for building a 
fleet, supp1yi6g the Egyptian; 
aiding the Cubans and main-
taining a front in Siberia, in 
addition to the normal expense 
of keeping a huge army, a 
modern air force and a decent 
space program. . 
Only 14 closing its society to 
outside influences can Russia

'[HE ECONOMIST 
11. May 1971 
Will he make it? 
CPYRGHT President Tito is fighting hard against his conservatives for 
a roform that could change the future of Jugoslav;a 
These are make-or-break days for President Tito's regime. 
.1 the constitutional reform which is now being debated 
gets by without a last-minute hitch, Jugoslavia will become 
freer than it or any other communist country has ever 
been before. Its ruling party will be able to claim, with 
as much justification as Mr Dubcek's Czechoslovakia in 
968, that it is a reasonably faithful mirror of its people's 
aspirationS. And President Tito will go down in history 
as the first communist leader to have reversed a trend 
which, for over half a century, has seemed to be going 
in one direction only?and to have done so without 
sacrificing his country's indepertdence or handing back the 
factories to the capitalists. 
The whole venture may still fail, though failure is less 
likely to take a dramatic form than to come by slow 
stages of demoralising delay and postponement. For these 
reforms, which aim at giving greater autonomy to 
Jigoslavia's six federal republics and two autonomous 
p -ovinces and, within them, to individual people and 
firms, have met powerful opposition within the communist 
party, just as the previous round of reforms did in 1965 
and 1966. No wonder that many Jugoslays are holding 
ti- eir breath as they watch their leaders prepare for the 
sl-owdown. Even President Tito appears to be nervous; 
he has recently made some grumpy speeches in which he 
ccmplained of indiscipline in the party and hinted that 
scvne top people may be sacked if they go on resisting 
pc licies on which agreement has been reached. 
Last January he had summoned leaders from all the 
re?ublics and autonomous provinces to Brioni, his island 
hone in the Adriatic, for talks about the future of the 
coAntry's economic and political system. He made it clear 
that he would not let them leave Brioni until they had 
re iched agr-ement on all the major issues. After two 
weeks he was able to announce an apparent agreement, 
and to publish 21 draft constitutional amendments 
embodying all the major proposals for reform. But only 
a Jew days later it became clear that his attempt to knock 
the leaders' heads together had failed. A Croat party 
leader, Mr Miko Tripalo, accused the Serbs of trying to 
wr.ggle out of firm commitments given at Brioni. One of 
these was a promise of more independence for the autono-
mc-us provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina, which are a 
part of the Serbian republic. Albanian leaders in Kosovo, 
whz.re the majority of Jugoslavia's million-odd Albanians 
live, have been pressing for this for a long time. Some 
Serbian leaders angrily retorted that Mr Tripalo was 
interfering InSerbia's internal affairs. Since then, Croatia's 
leaders have caused a sensation by demanding an official 
investigation of their complaint that "certain federal 
organs" (presumably the security service) had tried to 
discredit them by forging evidence which seemed to link 
them with extremist Croat groups abroad that are 
opposed to the very existence of Jugoslavia. One of these 
emigre groups was responsible for the recent murder of the 
Jugoslav ambassador in Sweden. Another, with its head-
quarters in west Berlin, has close links with Moscow 
and advocates Croatia's " liberation " with Soviet help. 
These polemics have shown that the harmony achieved 
at Brioni was short-lived. But President Tito is not giving 
up. This week he has called another party meeting at 
which he will again try to secure the leaders' support 
for changes in the constitution. Why is he so determined 
to push the reform through ? It is most unlikely that he is 
doing it out of any attachment to the idea of liberalisation. 
He is a man whose main concern has always been with 
power and how to keep it, and he has not changed now. 
But the president's wary instincts told him a long time 
ago that Jugoslavia would, once he is gone, be exposed 
to new ? pressures from Russia and its allies. And its 
most vulnerable point would be its multinational com-
position. He sees that it will not be able to withstand 
these pressures unless all its nationalities have a clear 
stake in the continued existence of the Jugoslav federal 
? state. Until very recently the Croats, the Slovenes and the 
.Albanians have all felt that they were discriminated 
against by the central governmeat, pariicularly in the 
fields of foreign trade and domestic capital investment. 
By introducing a new system that would make the 
:federal government responsible only for defence, foreign 
affairs, broad economio? policies and development aid 
for areas like Kosovo, President Tito hopes to give the 
'non-Serbs a new interest in Jugoslavia. And the preserva-
tion of the federal state seems to be his overriding concern 
as he prepares for his inevitable departure from the 
leadership. But although the old system.was as inefficient 
as it was uripopular, its abolition is not proving easy. 
`In Serbia, in particular, the men in favour of change 
are having a hard time trying to carry their more 
conservative and nationalist party colleagues with them. 
And there are many party officiais.elsewhere who mistrust 
the constitutional reform anthare .quittly trying tolorpedo 
it because they see it as a threat to their own power. 
The anger thc president has voiced in his recent speeches

,is said to be directed primarily at these people, and these 
'calculations of self-interest. 
To organise a really effective conservative opposition 
to the reforms would, however,, involve making a direct 
'challenge to President Tito's still enormous authority. A 
military coup ? would be remarkably difficult ? to, bring "off 
in a country Its decentralised as Jugoslavia. But the 
greatest obstacle to any conservative attempt to put 
the clock back is the unprecedented wave of democratic 
enthusiasm that is now visible in the country. this seems 
to be particularly strong in Croatia, whose relatively 
liberal leaders appear to enjoy genuine popularity'. A straw 
in the wind was the recent election at Zagreb university, 
where the student assembly installed a new leadership 
which includes non-party members and even practising 
Catholics.? .Croatia also seems to have something almost 
'approaching a free press at the moment. And in other 
republics, notably Slovenia and Serbia, there is a new 
toleration of opposition views, including extreme left-wing 
'ones. 
So President Tito ' will probably get his constitutional 
reform before his recently extended presre I- 1 L 
_LI Act_ _GA lit 
expires on August 17th, because there is no alternative to 
agreement for any except a small minority of pro-Moscow 
communists. He will be helped by Jugoslavia's precarious 
economic situation, which demands that the uncertainties 
surrounding the future of the country's banking and 
foreign trade system be resolved as quickly as possible. if 
he does succeed, there will be no rejoicing in Russia. The 
Russian leaders have long hoped to increase their influence 
in a weakened Jugoslavia after his death or retirement; 
and they have long feared the effect on their own subjects

Z,300 delegates to an economic con-

the rostrum beneath portraits of Marx, 
Engels, Lenin and himself, the throng 
broke into the wartime song of the Yu-
goslav partisans, "Comrade Tito, we give 
you our word, we shall follow you." 
But will they follow anybody else? 
Tito, who will be 79 on May 25, is 
given full credit for making Yugoslavia 
the most democratic of all the Com-
munist states as well as the one with 
the highest standard of living. Almost 
all Yugoslays still support the system 
of "self-management" that Tito intro-. 
duced 21 years ago, rejecting Soviet-
style planning and central control in 
favor of economic decentralization, 
which makes managers of factories di-

jail after criticizing some of 1 ito's meth-
ods in the 1950s; his second, Aleksander 
RankoviC, was banished from the party 
in 1966 when he opposed Tito's pol-
icies of decentralization and liberaliza-
tion. Both men are free today and live 
comfortably in Belgrade. 
Last fall, the aging Tito faced up to 
the fact that something would have to 
be done soon. "We have entered a stage 
now where we have no time," he told 
a party meeting in Zagreb. "Time works 
not for us but against us." To solve the 
problem of the succession, he proposed 
the creation of a collective presidency 
made up of two or three leaders elect-
ed by the assemblies of each republic 
and one or two by each province. Iron-
ically, the national debate over Tito's 
proposals merely brought the country's 
separatist tendencies into the open. 
Deep Resentments. To stem the dis-
content, Tito began stumping the coun-
try and threatened a party purge and 
"administrative measures"?a Commu-
nist euphemism meaning summary po-
lice action?for enemies of the federal 
system. Two weeks ago, he summoned 
party leaders to his Brioni Island re-
treat in the Adriatic Sea and scheduled 
a special party conference to convene 
this summer. Last week he stepped up 
nis warnings against "llinisc why 
be convinced," including "some generals 
who sit around the caf?" "megalo-
maniacs who want to become President," 
and intellectuals who have opposed his 
recent proposals. 
Few nations are as vulnerable to in-
ternal division as Yugoslavia. Two of 
its republics, Slovenia and Croatia, were 
once linked to the Habsburg empire and 
developed as part of the West; the others 
stagnated for centuries under Turkish 
rule. The cultured Slovene has neither 
'language nor heritage in common with 
the illiterate Montenegran. The indepen-
dent, expansionist Serbs have dreamed 
of a true nation of Yugoslays (literally 
"southern Slays"). They formed the 
backbone of the wartime resistance; to 
this day, they accuse the Croats of hav-
ing collaborated with the Germans. Re-
sentments run so deep that the Yugoslays 
have never chosen a national anthem. 
Unbelievable Pressure. Tito's task of 
maintaining unity while solving the prob-
lem of succession is made even more dif-
ficult by the fact that the economy is 
rin bad shape because the Yugoslays 
have been living beyond their means. De-
spite a 15% devaluation of the dinar 
last fall, Yugoslavia's trade deficit rose

62% in the first qua' ter ot the year, 
while retail prices soared 12% and the 
cost of living 13%. 
Two weeks ago, Tito warned his coun-
trymen that foreign agents (meaning pri-
marily Soviet secret police) had been 
exerting "unbelievable pressure" on the 
government. "We should allow no sixth 
column to penetrate our country," he 
said. It is possible, of course, that he 
had chosen to fight the drift toward sep-
aratism by raising the specter of Soviet 
troublemaking. But there is no doubt 
that the Soviets would like to see Yu-
goslavia disintegrate. If Tito manages 
to arrange a genuine succession, he will 
have made another great stride toward 
achieving a reasonably democratic 
Marxist society. If he fails, Yugoslavia 
could splinter under the weight of sep-
aratist feeling and Soviet meddling.

1F1E GERMAN JOURNALIST WAS A SOVIET SPY 
Background on the Ruhlmann case in Yugoslavia: THE GERMAN JOURNALIST 
WAS A SOVIET SPY. 
Vienna, 13 May. According to word reaching here from Belgrade, details' . 
revealing of the Soviet hand in espionage activities in Yugoslavia may 
soon be forthcoming. Well informed Yugoslav officials have long admitted 
privately their strong suspicions that Der Spiegel correspondent Hans Peter 
Ruhlmann, convicted last January on charges of espionage involving passage 
of Yugoslav military secrets to a "foreign power", was an agent of East 
German intelligence on behalf of the Soviets. 
Ruhlmann and two Yugoslav collaborators were arrested in March last 
year and have been held in custody since. Following an extensive investigation 
their trial opened in September, almost immediately went into secret 
sessions, and since then, only brief press accounts have given clues of the 
trial's progress. In January, Ruhlmann was given a six-year sentence and 
convicted for having obtained from his Yugoslav codefendants highly 
classified military and official information for a period of two years and 
of having passed this information to a "foreign government and a foreign 
organization as well as giving part of it to two representatives of a foreign 
state." One charge brought out was that Ruhlmann sought and got details 
during September 1968 concerning "Yugoslav defense preparations and the 
military -political situation during the month of August 1968" (the month 
during which the Warsaw Pact troops invaded Czechoslovakia). It also 
appears that Ruhlmann was to concentrate on the political military situation 
in Croatia and on the unpublicized conflict between Croatia and Serbian 
interests. 
Last month, according to the Yugoslav news service Tanjug (28 April) the 
_ 
Supreme Military Court over-ruled the conviction handed down by the lower 
court and returned the case with a request for more evidence and the name 
(or names) of the foreign power involved. In line with oft-expressed 
Yugoslav suspicions that Ruhlmann was a Soviet agent, whether directly 
or indirectly controlled by Moscow, the Supreme Court now apparently 
wants the facts brought out into the open. And there is no doubt that all 
his ties in with Yugoslovia's convictions that Mbscow's ulterior motive is 
a Balkanized Yugoslavia in the post-Tito era.

an eastern city. Zagreb 
looks Ald, feels like any 
city in Austria or southern 
Germany. 
Here of course is fertile 
soil for outsiders desiring 
to break up the Yugoslav 
federation. 
The Germans played upon 
the natural and inherited 
friction between Serb and 
Croat when they were build-
ing Hitler's "Third Reich." 
Naturally, they played to 
the Croats with the Ger-
manic cultural background 
against the Serbs. Russians 
have traditionally tried to 
exploit Serbian hostilities. 
During the month of 
April, Tito's spokesmen in 
Belgrade accused the Rus-
sians and Poles of trying 
to interfere in domestic Yu-
goslav politics. Specifically, 
it was alleged that the Yu-
goslav ?gr?olony in 
West Germany had now 
been taken over by the Rua-
sians and was being used 
by the Russians in an effort 
to split Yugoslavia apart. 
This, if true, would be 
both logical and illogical. 
The ?gr?roats in 
West Germany are left over 
from the Ustachi movement 
of World War II. The 
Ustachis sided with the Ger-
man occupiers of Yugo-
slavia. They are conserva-
tives according to World 
War II standards. After all, 
they fought Tito's Commu-
nist partisans during the 
civil war in Yugoslavia. 
But Croat separatism is 
the easiest emotion for any 
outsider to exploit. Croats 
resent being under Serbian 
rule. Granted, Tito himself 
is a Croat, not a Serb, yet 
there is a tendency which 
even he has been unable to 
break for Serbs to dominate 
the bureaucracy of the 
federation, particularly the 
secret pence. 
Even the score 
The Russians would, obvi-
ously, like to break up the 
Yugoslav federation. It has 
been a thorn in their side 
an East European Commu-
nist country which refuses 
to bend the knee to Moscow,, 
or follow the line of Kremlin 
orthodoxy! 
It would be reasonable WI 
expect the Kremlin to con-
sider this moment in history 
as their last best chance to, 
even the score with Tito and 
wreck his great plan for a 
lasting constitution which 
will bind his various peo. 
pies together. 
In the West we have no 
way of knowing whether. 
the Kremlin has actually 
,plcked up the old Ustachi, 
outfit as an instrument of 
its modern purposes. We do 
know that the Yugoslav Am-
bassador in Stockholm was 
fatally shot five weeks ago 
by persons presumed to be 
members of the old Ustachi 
underground. 
And we do know that the 
Kremlin regards Tito's Yu-
goslavia as an affront to its 
prestige and a danger to 
its control over the rest of 
Its "sphere of influence" in" 
Eastern Europe,,

Yugoslav Unity 
President Tito's hints of the need for 
a purge of separatist elements in his own 
Yugoslavian Communist party can only 
be disturbing to Western observers. The 
disquieting thought is that any such 
purge might just postpone the ultimate 
showdown among the various nationalis-
tic interests in the country, leaving new 
scores to be settled after Tito's depart-
ure. 
Tito, leader of the surviving partisan 
movement of World War II, is the main 
ingredient of the cement that holds to-
gether this collection of territories of the 
? old Austro-Hungarian Empire, now in 
the form of six republics and a couple of 
autonomous provinces, with four official 
languages and three religions. But Tito, 
78, cannot be expected to perform this 
adhesive function for too many more 
years. His announcement last year of 
plans for a collective presidency, after he 
? leaves, was: an attempt to impose a pos-
? thumous unity on the Serbs, Croats, Slov-
enes, Montenegrans and other country-
men who would survive him. 
Among recent events that have cre-
o.ted a crisis for Yugoslav unity was the 
assassination of the country's ambassa-
dor to Sweden by Croatian separatists. A 
continuing source of disunity are the eco-
nomic disparities among various parts of 
Yugoslavia, with the industrialized north 
resentful about its role in propping up 
, less developed parts of the country. 
Tito has our best wishep in his effort 
to keep his nation together. The main 
beneficiary of a Yugoslav split-up would 
be the Soviet Union. For the Russians, an 
Independent and strong Yugoslavia, 
ready to put up a bruising fight if 
threatened with the fate of Hungary or 
Czechoslovakia, has represented a barely 
tolerable insult tO Soviet dominance in 
Communist Eastern Europe. But a Yugo-
slavia once again Balkanized, with all 
that term implies in the way of political 
chaos and weakness, would be easy pick-
ing for the guardians of Soviet Commu-
nist ascendancy. 
The Yugoslays, who were able to raise 
their, heads after centuries of tyranny, 
should understand this better than any-
one. Let's hope they decide to hang to-
gether, rather than go separately to the 
Soviet gibbets.

Tito Says 
arty Will 
Keep Unity 
By Dan Morgan 
WarhIngton Pogt rorelirn Service 
BELGRADE, May 1?Presi-1 
dent Tito today indicated that! 
the Yugoslav League of Com-
munists has no intention ofi 
giving up its dominant role 
during the current period of 
political decentralization. 
The 78-year-old leader nei-
ther dramatized nor mini-I 
mized the country's difficul-
ties. Instead, as he has done so 
often during tough times in 
the past, he soberly, empha-
sized that Yugoslavia's prob-
lems were solvable and ap-
pealed for national unity. 
Hondreds of thousands of 
Yugoslays listened to the pres-
ident's May Day speech on 
radio and television. It was 
'broadcast live from Labin, 
near the Italian border. which 
is celebrating the 50th anni-
versary of a brief workers up-
rising in 1021. 
Tito arrived in the small 
coal-mining center fresh from 
a three-day meeting with 
about 80 top Communist lead-
ers from all over the country 
convened by him personally to 
try to put an end to regional 
quarrels that have marred the 
country's unity in recent 
Weeks. 
He was applauded warmly 
and often by a large audience 
as he read from notes. 
The rivalries between the 
regions have sharpened in re-
cent months as a major consti-
tutional reorganization that 
will give much more say to 
the six Yugoslav republics and 
reduce the power of the cen-
tral government nears comple-
tion. 
The various local leader-
ships are now arguing over 
such complex questions as the 
allocation of former federal 
funds, the financing of major 
regional .projects once subsi-
dized by Belgrade, and other 
complex issues. 
Tito singled out the Yugo-
slav press and television, uni-
versity professors, and manag-
ers of banks as those who 
were Sharpening local rivaV 
ries or failing to heed the line 
laid down by the Yugoslav 
League of Communists, which' 
he ?heads:, 
'lie said that the league 
would he "merciless, in elimi-
nating the deformations in its 
own ranks." 
In the present decentraliza-
tion some have raised the 
qu'estion whether Yugoslavia's 
Communists Party is breaking 
down into regional parties. 
President Tit's answer to 
that question today seemed te. 
be a stern "no." 
He said there had been 
agreement that the League of 
Communists was "the force to 
overcome the difficulties 
which are not so big." 
We should be merciless to 
all deformations. In the league 
aild also to those from outside 
who wish to introduce splits in 
our society, in our masses. We 
have placed democracy on a 
very high level, on a strong 
basis. but there can be no de-
mocracy for the enemies of 
our Socialist soricty." 
There was applause when he) 
criticized the Yugoslav press 
far carrying "alander" and in- I 
ticauraeies. 
In the past few months, 
newspapers in Belgrade, the 
capital of Serbia and of Yugo-
slavia, and those in Zagreb In 
Croatia have exchanged sal-
, vos, and have printed state-
ments and interviews from 
persons favoring a much more 
radical decentralization of Yu-
goslav life. 
In the economy, Tito com-
plained about "megalomaniac" 
development plans that could 
not be realized, and warned 
bank managers to stop making 
policy on their own or face ex-
pulsion not only from the 
Communist Party but also 
from their positions. ? 
The semi-independent 
b7ks, which are playing an 
ev r larger role in financing 
Yugoslavia's industrial devel, 
optnent, have been criticized 
by some party officials for 
.usurping the party's role in 
planning the national develop.

davia's current political crisis 
cn opponents abroad but also 
rtimated that he would crack 
oown on domestic dissent and 
rrobably shuffle both the Gov-
ernment and 'Communist party. 
In a rambling, 40-minute 
May Day address, broadcast on 
radio and television ?from the 
tawn of Labin near the Italian 
border, the 78-year-old leader 
rsserved his sharpest remarks 
fr Yugoslav newspaper and 
talevision journalists, university 
Audents and . professors and 
'tnegalontaniac" investors. 
These groups have often been 
targets for his wrath. ? 
But the speech, which re7 
s-ealed few details of the three-
e..ay leadership aneeting Presi-
gent Tho held this week, had 
a new tone of harshness toward 
Icritics at home and abroad. 
"We have placed, democracy 
on a very high level, on a strong 
foundation," the President said 
In a reference to the open dis-
cussion that makes Yugoslavia 
unusual among Communist na-
tions. "But there cannot be de-
mocracy for the enemies of our 
social system who fight against 
everything we wish to achieve." 
"Up until now we have tol-
erated too much," he said as 
applause from the well-dressed 
crowd in the coal-mining town 
Interrupted him. "We have tol-
erated such enemies and their 
actions too much, and they are 
at work in many areas." 
The President, who will be 
79 on May 25, said that, the 
mass of Yugoslays still gave 
him and ? his associates in the 
party full support. On a recent 
(trip through backward ems in 
the south, he said, he had been 
rreceived "with the same faith" 
{its was Shown him in after 
Wotid Waril, when he turned 
liii.Vietoticiut Partisan move-
ment into a government. 
Toward the end of that trip, 
Marshall Tito made several 
angry speeches indicating that 
nationalist rivalries among 
leaders of the country's six 
republics were becoming a 
danger to Yugoslavia's develop-
ment and unity. It was then 
that he announced this week's 
leadership meeting, which ob-
servers thought would be a 
major showdown on economic 
and political issues. 
In discussing the meeting 
on his island retreat of Brioni, 
however, the President said 
only that "very sharp discus-
sion" had ended in unanimity. 
He did not say how outstand-
ing economic questions had 
been reconciled nor did he 
point to any change in exist-
ing policy beyond "more en-
ergetic" application of party 
and governmental discipline. 
Greater Autonomy for Republics 
lStating that Yugoslavia was 
not in danger of disintegration, 
be said .the current reorgani-
zation giving greater autonomy 
to the governments of the six 
republics would strengthen the 
nation. 
"We have settled the na-
tional question, not only in 
theory," he maintained. "All 
that remains is to implement 
our decisions. There ? is no 
nationality in Yugoslavia that 
wants to be outside Yugo-
slavia." 
Part of the reorganization, 
he added, would probably be 
a shuffle of federal posts, 
which many expect this sum-
mer. Beyond that, President 
Tito said, it may prove neces-
sary to remove prominent party 
members from posts that they 
have become ;"to Weak" to 
occupy. 
As for bankers, business 
managers and others who fol-
lbw policies opposed by the 
Government's economic stabili-
ration measures, he declared,' 
"They will not only be ex-
pelled from thor rty but also

Yugosi v census Reflects 
Nationality S lit 
By Dan Morgan 
Washington Post Foreign Service 
LGRADE?How many 
Yugoslays are there in Yu-
goslavia? 
The answer emerging 
from prelimiary returns in 
the country's 1971 popula-
tion census is: probably not 
too many. 
? For the purposes of the 
census?and to the anger of 
, many people who identify 
themselves with the country 
as a whole rather than with 
one of the five national 
groups composing it?"Yu-
goslav" is no nationality at 
all. 
Nevertheless, an undis-
closed number of respond-
ents to the survey ques-
tionnaires who consider 
themselves to be Yugoslays 
have registered under the 
category for those of "unde-
clared" nationality. 
A period of economic and 
political decentralization 
has rekindled rivalries 
among the country's five na-
tional groups?the Serbs, 
Croats, Slovenes, Monten-
egrins and Macedonians?
and the census has become 
embroiled in the contro-
? versey over national identity. 
Furthermore, the census 
is coming at a time of major 
constitutional reorganiza-
tion, in which the federal 
government is losing many 
of its powers, and there is 
fear in some quarters that 
the concept of the Yugoslav 
multinational state could be 
put in question. 
In protest against the cen-
sus's emphasis on identifica-
tion with national groups, 
.some students at Belgrade 
,University reportedly have 
listed themselves as Eski-
mos. 
One Belgrade woman, a 
.Serb, received a visit from a 
census taker 
AltOrWeldsf 0r 
band, also a Serb, was ab-
sent. She listed herself and 
their two children as "un-
declared." The husband be-
came furious when he heard 
this, telling her hotly, "How 
could you do it? You gave 
birth to two fine Serbs, and 
you call them undeclareds." 
The drafting of the census 
questionnaire was a one-
year process, filled with po-
litical controversy involving 
representatives of the coun-
, try's largest national groups, 
the Serbs (42 per cent of the 
population) and the Croats. 
(24 per cent). 
The Croats resisted ef-
forts to permit purely re-
gional identifications in the 
census, but in the end three 
regional groupings were al-
lowed?those of Dalmatia, 
Kordun and Lika. All are in 
Croatia, but an estimated 
half-million Serbs live in 
those regions. 
One Croat from Dalmatia, 
the Adriatic coastal region 
between Dubrovnik and Ri-
jeka, said he had passed up 
a chance to declare himself 
as a Dalmatian "because I 
didn't want to throw away 
my vote." 
Some persons are unsure 
what they are. These are the 
children from "mixed" na-
tionality marriages, which 
make up 12 per cent of the 
total. 
The Yugoslav authorities 
want to encourage the trend 
toward decentralization, but 
to check it before it turns 
Into regional chauvinism. 
They are frankly no encour-
aging any movement toward 
Yugoslav nationality. 
Laszlo Varga, a federal of-
ficial in charge of relations 
among national groups, said: 
Yugoslavia is not a unified 
national group. It is a ro-
Inliteaggef69 diti9PY2 : 
are some who think of Yugo:', 
slavia concept as an excuse 
for a new hegemony." 
After World War II, the 
newly installed Communist 
government under President 
Tito consolidated power in a 4, 
rigidly, controlled, central-
ized system under the ban-
ner of a unified Yugoslavia. , 
The decentralization proc-
ess started soon afterward 
has now reached new dimen-
sions. So, apparently, has 
the fervor of the country's 
national groups. 
One indication of this is; 
the outpouring of volunteer 
support in Serbia and Mon-
tenegro for the building of a? 
railway between Belgrade 
and Bar, a small town on 
the Adriatic near the Al- , 
banian border. Bar is now 
earmarked for development 
as a major port to compete, 
with Rijeka, in Croatia. 
In the first week of a cam-
paign to raise money for the , 
project, $20 million has , 
poured in from individuals , 
and enterprises. Some 
school children in Serbia 
have given up milk and 
cookies to support the drive, 
and some individuals have 
taken out bonds for as much 
as $1,000. 
The project would fulfill 
an ancient dream of linking 
Belgrade and Serbia with 
the Mediterranean. The ap-
peal for funds, similar to the 
volunteer fund drive I 
launched in Poland for re-
building the royal palace in , 
Warsaw, has caused Serbian 
patriotism to well up. 
. The plans for the railroad 
and.. port? were stalled for 
years because of Croatia 
and Slovenia's reluctance to 
contribute massively to, a 
project that would benefit: 
mainly Serbia. 
Finally in 1966, the it i ? 
C !NIRO P M41 1S4 P 
proved, with 85 per cent of 
the funds covered by the 
federal government's fund 
for development of tourism 
kand shipbuilding 
? Two factors have caused 
the Serbs to turn now to 
their own devices to com-
plete the project. The first 
was a cost overrun of some. 
$80 million which the federal 
'authorities said they would 
not make up; the railroad 
'bond issue will cover that 
:amount. The second was the 
trend toward decentraliza-
tion and regional responsi-
bility in carrying out invest-
ment projects. 
Serbia, which for years 
opposed decentralization, 
:has dramatically changed its 
policy in the last three 
. years, and it is now pressing, 
,for greater local autonomy. 
Petal; Jovanovic, a leading 
'engineer on the Belgrade-
Bar commerce consortium, 
says that if the federal role 
in financing the projects' 
ends, "Serbia has assumed 
the obligation to continue."

Yugoslavia's Future

AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT in. Yugo-
slavia's development it seems ap-
propriate to focus attention upon 
her internal affairs. This is not because for-
eign relations are currently stagnant or unin-
teresting?indeed some rather significant ini-
tiatives and successes have occurred in the 
past year or so?but rather because domestic 
affairs appear to be moving toward a severe 
test of the edifice of Yugoslav nationalism so 
painstakingly constructed during the postwar 
era. More specifically, the three closely 
linked internal problems of regional rivalry, 
political succession and unbalanced economic 
development are creating a growing concern 
about Yugoslavia's future among both Yugo-
slav:- and students of Yugoslav affairs. 
ETHNIC BACKGROUND 
Although composed of elements of several 
long-established cultures and politics, Yugo-
slavia is a relatively young nation. It was 
formed in 1919, in the aftermath of World 
War I and the collapse of the Turkish and 
Austro-Hungarian Empires. Its formation 
was due largely to the efforts of the Serbs, a 
numerous and dynamic Balkan people who 
had enjoyed national independence since the 
early nineteenth century. The other major 
group in that original Yugoslav state was the 
Croat nation, which had existed for many 
centuries to the northeast of the Serbs within 
the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Cathol-
icism and Western (if not Germanic) orien-
tation of the Croats distinguished them 
sharply from the Orthodox and Russian-ori-
ented Serbs, even though both spoke much 
the same language. In addition to Serbs 
and Croats, Yugoslavia also embraced sev-
eral smaller Balkan Slavic groups: the 
Slovenes of the northern alpine regions; the 
Macedonians of the extreme south, closely 
related, historically and culturally, to the 
Bulgarians; the Montenegrins, a mountainous 
offshoot of the Serbian nation; and the in-
habitants of Bosnia-Herzegovina, who com-
prised an uneasy mixture of Serbian, Croatian 
and Turkish elements, the last a consequence 
of centuries-long inclusion in the Turkish 
empire, an experience shared by the Serbs 
and Macedonians. Besides these Slavic 
groups them were the Shiptars, closely related 
Lo the Albanians and inhabiting a region, now 
known as Kosmet, bordering Albania, as well 
as a melange of Hungarian, Rumanian and 
Germanic groups spread across the Voivo-
dina, a plains region to the northwest. 
These ethnic patterns have persisted, and 
it is impossible to comprehend contemporary 
Yugoslavia without an awareness of their 
existence. The frictions they produced were 
a major cause of Yugoslav impotence during 
the interwar period. They deeply influenced 
the character of the anti-Nazi partisan move-
ment which Josip Tito created during World 
War IL They present perhaps the most 
fundamental challenge to the development 
of a stable Yugoslav nation-state today. 
In considering the problem of regional 
rivalry in Yugoslavia, it is well to distinguish

CPYRGHT 
between two rather different sources of ten-
sion, one specifically ethnic and the other 
essentially political. Ethnic tensions arise 
from long-standing prejudices ("Montene-
grim are lazy," "Serbs ara arrogant," "Slo... 
VC11CS are chiselers") and misunderstandings 
among the various ethnic groups. In most, 
although by no means all, cases these are di-
rected against the Serbs by the other na-
tienalities, and vice versa. Political tensions 
have to do with the issue of power: should 
power be centralized in the federal govern-
ment or in the republican and other constitu-
ent governments? This issue is, of course, 
enormously complicated by the fact that the 
seat of federal power, Belgrade, is also the 
capital of Serbia, and has traditionally been 
staffed largely- by Serbs even when upper-
- echelon positions have been distributed 
among the various ethnic groups. 
In the early postwar years, the newly-in-
stalled Communist regime's approach to this 
problem of regional rivalry was a centralist 
one: political and economic control was con-
centrated heavily in Belgrade, and the party 
itself was organized in a way that permitted 
little autonomy to its republican (i.e. ethnic) 
subdivisions. Following the 1948 break with 
Moscow, for reasons of both political and 
economic expediency, this centralized power 
structure was gradually modified to the point 
where today it N clear that both the party and 
2:overnmenta1 organizations at the republican 
level are beginning to rival the authority of 
the central government in Belgrade. 
For example; in the summer of 1969, a 
bitter controversy broke out between Slovenia 
and the federal government over the alloca; 
lion of highway construction funds. At one 
point, the Slovene Premier and most of his 
Cabinet threatened to resign if Slovene de-
mands were not met, and the personal inter-
vention of President Tito was required even 
In reach a highly unsatisfactory compromise. 
;a Kosmet, matters took a still more ominous 
mrn during 1968-1969 with the surfacing of 
NI. Djekic, "Troubles of Kossovo," Yugoslav 
Life, XVI, I (January, 1971), p. 3, and The Econ-
(London), May 2, 1970, p. 44. 
The New York Times, February 5, 1970, p. 2. 
widespread anti-Serb demonstrations and 
agitation for Republic status for Kosmet, in-
stead of its present position as an autonomous 
region within Serbia. This demand was 
flatly denied and some 30 ShIptars were triad 
and sentenced for "fomenting national ha-
tred." At the same time, however, the fed-
eral government took significant steps to im-
prove economic conditions in Kosmet (its 
per capita income of $250 is the lowest in 
Yugoslavia) and to place more Shiptars in 
positions of authority within the region.i 
It is in Croatia, however, that ethnic and 
political tensions most strongly reinforce each 
other and where the most troubling situation 
is developing. The Croats have always 
chafed at what they consider to be exploita-
tion by the poorer and more backward re-
gions of Yugoslavia?i.e., Serbia, Macedonia, 
Montenegro and Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is 
only since the mid-1960's, however, that the 
political system has been sufficiently liberal-
ized to allow relatively free expression of 
these sentiments, not only in public forums 
but within the party organization itself. The 
gist of the complaint is that Croatia, together 
with Slovenia (which is also quite advanced 
economically), is being held back in economic 
development by grandiose development plans 
for the southern parts of the country, fi-
nanced by federal taxes which drain off cap-
ital from the north. The two northern re-
publics, with only a little over a quarter of 
the population, account for almost seventy 
per cent of Yugoslavia's industrial production 
and a like proportion of its foreign trade 
rarnin gs. 
At the end of 1969 a Plenary Session of 
the Croatian League of Communists sharply 
condemned the view expressed by certain 
Belgrade "hardliners" that "Croatism" (re-
gional nationalism) had developed to the 
point where some sort of central discipline 
was needed. The Plenum asserted Croatia's 
right to manage her internal affairs as she 
saw fit. 2 During 1970, demands were voiced 
by highly placed Croatian leaders for further 
decentralization of the banking system in or-
der to give each republic full control of all 
capital resources created within its bounds.

This political self-assertiveness in Croatia 
has been paralleled by ethnic self-assertion, 
centered ixtrticularly on the delicate matter 
of language. Serbian and Croatian are very 
iimilar, differing mainly in alphabet (Roman 
(ot. Croatian, Cyrillic for Serbian), the pro-
nounciaton of certain vowels, and vocabu-
lary. During the postwar era, the official 
view has been that they arc dialects of the 
same language designated, rather awkwardly, 
"Serbo-Croatian." In 1954, the task of pro-
ducing a definitive dictionary of the Serbo-
Croatian language was undertaken jointly by 
the official Croatian and Serbian cultural or-
ganizations. 
The project never generated great enthu-
siasm, and as regional rivalry began to in-
tensify in the 1960's, it clearly began to waver. 
In 1967, furor was touched off when a group 
of Croatian intellectuals demanded that 
Croatian be recognized as a separate lan-
;nage, equal to Serbian in legal and cultural 
;tatus. Serb intellectuals responded by de-
nanding that all Serbs living in Croatia 
(about 160,000 persons) should be entitled to 
learn and write their language in the Cyrillic 
olphabet. At that time, the party stepped in, 
with Tito publicly rebuking both sides, but 
the tension continued to grow until finally, 
in early 1971, the Croatian organization an-

THE PROBLEM OF SUCCESSION 
'l'aken by itself, this linguistic controversy 
might seem trivial, even ludicrous, but as an 
important element in a larger pattern of 
;rowing Croat-Serbian animosity it is indeed 
disquieting. That pattern is undoubtedly 
one of the reasons that President Tito has 
openly tried, over the past two years, to create 
machinery for political succession capable of 
weathering the situation his departure will 
create. For there is no doubt that the aging 
leader (he will be 79 this year) is one of the 
most important factors of cohesion in Yugo-
glavia today. His personal intervention in 
3 The New York Times, January 29, 1971, p.8. 
the Slovene and Croatian episodes has already 
been mentioned, and there have been many 
similar situations over the years. Born a 
Croat, his career has transcended regional 
rivalries, and ha holds the respect of at least 
sizable segments of the general public and 
the leadership strata in all parts of Yugo-
slavia. 
His effort to prepare for the inevitable?
his own departure from the scene?has pro-
ceeded on two levels: party and governmen-
tal. At each level it has taken the form of 
arrangements designed to insure (so far as 
such things can be assured) a regionally-bal-
anced, post-Tito collective leadership. 
The Yugoslav League of Communists ( the 
official name of the ruling Communist party) 
held its ninth congress in March, 1969. At 
this congress, Tito proposed several structural 
changes, which were subsequently adopted. 
The existing eleven-man Executive Commit-
tee was replaced by a fifteen-man Executive 
Bureau, composed by statute of two top 
party leaders from each of the six republics, 
one from each of the two autonomous re-
gions, and Tito. His position in the Bureau 
was designated as unique and will cease to 
exist after his retirement or death. Other 
changes included the expansion of the next-
lower body from 35 to 52 members, with 
representation on a demographic basis, and 
elimination of the 154-member Central Com-
mittee entirely, in favor of an Annual League 
Conference of approximately 200 party no-
tables. 
All this may seem a mere numbers and 
semantics game, but there is a clear intent: 
to create an ethnically-balanced, collective 
party executive, checked by a demographi-
cally-apportioned referent body. About a 
year and a half later, September, 1970, Presi-
dent Tito turned his attention to reforming 
Yugoslavia's governmental structure at the 
federal level. Actually, there had been many 
earlier governmental reorganizations, the 
most recent example of which was the crea-
tion, in 1968, of a Federal Executive Council. 
This 17-man body corresponded to the Cabs-
net of Western parliamentary systems and 
was headed by a Premier, initially Mika

Spiliak. a Croat, :md subserviently Mita 
Ribicic, a Slovene. In addition to this 
Council, in 1968, there was also created a 
Presidency (but no Vice Presidei icy) which 
was filled by .Tito himself, While the exact 
role and powers of the Presidency were not 
- precisely clarified, it seemed to serve primarily 
as a position from which Tito could survey 
the operations of the federal government and 
intervene in politics when necessary, as in the 
1968 Belgrade University student strike. 
Tim's September, 1970, proposal was to 
make this Presidency into a collective body 
composed of two or three representatives 
from each republic from "the main social-po-
litical groups, including, of course, the Com-
munist party."4 Inasmuch as Tito, in the 
same speech, criticized the work of the Fed-
eral Executive Council, it seemed likely that 
his intention was to reduce the political role 
of the Council and make the new collective 
Presidency the real locus of power at the fed-
eral level, together with the Federal Assembly 
(Parliament). As public discussion of his 
proposal developed during the fall and win-
ter. this supposition received further con-
firmation. Draft constitutional amendments 
published in February, 1971, described a 
fourteen-man Presidential Council consisting, 
like the party's Executive Bureau, of two rep-
resentatives from each republic and one from 
each autonomous region, all elected for five-
year terms. This body would choose a 
President and Vice President, but for a one-
year term only, with the two offices appar-
ently being rotated among new republics each 
year. This Presidential Council would have 
the power to propose legislation to the Fed-
eral Assembly, but if the two bodies could not 
reconcile any differences within nine months, 
both must be dissolved. The Federal Execu-
tive Council, conversely, would become a 
strictly administrative organ, charged only 
with carrying out policy. Tito would con-
tinue as President of the Republic and in that 
capacity would join and head the new Presi-

These top-level reorganizations, ?vhich arc 
still only in the discussion stage, will probably 
not be promulgated until the summer of 
1971; they represent only one side of the 
effort to deal with impending post-Tito re-
gional problems. Included in the same 
package of proposed constitutional amend-
ments arc several whose purpose is clearly to 
carry the process of political and economic 
decentralization still further and thereby to 
placate anti-centralist (and anti-Serb?) senti-
ments in the republics. These amendments 
would leave the federal government with full 
power only over foreign affairs, defense, and 
certain aspects of the economy, such as the 
currency system and the regulation of the 
unitary market. The only investment cap-
ital remaining in federal hands, for example, 
would be a special fund for the use of under-
developed areas, on a revolving credit basis, 
to be raised by income taxes levied on all 
Yugoslays. Most federal laws and regula-
tions, particularly in the field of economics, 
would require the assent of the republics be-
fore they could take effect. 
Tito's strategy for dealing with the prob-
lem of succession may now be summarized as 
follows: improved consensus-building organs 
at the federal level (Presidential Council and 
Party Executive Bureau) in combination with 
increased autonomy at the republic level. 
While on first glance this may seem to be a 
bold strategy, it is very likely the only one 
available at the moment, for no one, not even 
Tito, has the stature or authority to deal with 
the problem by the alternative path of politi-
cal recentralization. 
Will it work? No one can say for sure at 
this point. Edward Kardelj, Tito's closest 
political associate, has said that: 
the collective presidency will not be a magic 
wand to solve all the controversies and problems 
that time brings, but it should certainly speed up 
the discussion and settlement of such disputes.... 
Should the presidency be incapable of such in-
itiatives, it would certainly mean that it was not 
performing its duty. This would mean not only 
that this organ is in crisis, but that the whole 
society is in crisis. But our society is not in

crisis and wc have no reason to doubt that the 
presidency will perform its positive role in over-
coming social problems and conflicts.? 
Not so sure was Milovan Djilas, a former 
member of the party inner circle long in dis-
favor for his outspokenly critical views. 
Writing last October in The New York Times 
he asserted that: 
the economic and ideological crisis has trans-
formed itself into a governmental crisis. Be-
cause of this the proposed reorganization of the 
apex of the government?a "collective" presi-
dency instead of a president, will aggravate 
rather than lessen the inefficiency of the admin-
istration and the bickering of the already disas-
sociated chiefs.7 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
Djilas' remark brings up the third critical 
problem mentioned at the beginning of this 
article, but so far alluded to only in passing: 
the problem of unbalanced economic devel-
opment. This problem has many facets, in-
cluding of course the serious disparity be-
tween the more and less developed regions, 
but in recent years the salient fact has been 
that both producer and consumer demand 
has grown throughout most of the country 
much faster than the economy's ability to 
satisfy it. One consequence of this was a 
strong inflationary trend which shot the cost 
pf living up by 11 per cent in each of the 
past two years.? Another was the huge and 
;rowing foreign trade deficit (excess of im-
-ports over exports) which reached the stag-
oring figure of $1.2 billion in 1970. Foreign 
currency receipts from tourists and from 
Yugoslays working abroad reduced this to a 
balance-of-payments deficit of "only" $370 
million, but the fact remained that even such 
a deficit indicated a serious shortcoming.

regime, central controls over wages, prices, 
investments, exports and imports would have 
been imposed long ago, in the face of such 
trends. Yugoslav central planners hesitated, 
and in fact they lacked the authority to

tered economy established by the 1965 re-
forms. Instead, they attempted to apply a 
number of indirect solutions to the problem, 
such as negotiations for special trade agree-
mews with the European Common Market 
(successfully concluded in early 1970) ; en-
couragement of foreign investment in Yugo-
slavia through partnerships with Yugoslav 
firms (enacted in 1967 but disappointing in. 
results) ;? toleration of high levels of migra-
tion of both unemployed and skilled workers 
(over 850,000 were abroad during 1970, 
mostly in West Europe, contributing some 
$450 million in remittances to Yugoslavia) ;10 
and expanded tourism (foreign tourists 
brought in $350 million during 1970).11 
Toward the end of 1970, however, it was 
clear that more drastic steps would be re-
quired at the federal level. With the ap-
proval of the Federal Assembly, an import 
surtax was established, followed in October 
by a temporary price freeze and additional 
import restrictions. December saw the set-
ting of an 11 per cent ceiling on wage in-
creases to last until April 30, 1971, at which 
time the federal government expected to in-
stitute, in cooperation with the republics, a 
"comprehensive stabilization program" of an 
as yet unspecified nature. Then, in mid-
January, 1971, the dinar was devaluated by 
one-quarter of its value (from 12.50 dinars/ 
dollar to 15.00), a move designed simultane-
ously to improve the position of Yugoslav 
tourism and exports, and to discourage the 
import of foreign goods." 
These are short-term solutions, however, 
capable only of providing a breathing spell 
in which to deal with the underlying prob-
lem. It is by no means clear at this writing 
how the Yugoslays intend to do this, but one 
thing is reasonably certain; the solution will 
not involve a recentralization of economic 
power in Belgrade. The proposed constitu-
tional reforms mentioned earlier have as their

central purpose the expansion of the eco-
nomic as well as the political autonomy of 
the constituent republics. Here in one Yugo-
slav commentary on the proposals from an 
official publication: 
The most substantive purpose of the reorganiza-
tion is to deprive the federal state organs of the 
right arbitrarily to appropriate to themselves 
the social capital accumulation, and to distrib-
ute it themselves, and to play the role of investor 
and carrier of enlarged economic reproduc-
tion. . . By abolishing the elements of eco-
nomic statist .domination over the republics, it 
is held, not only will the social relations of self-
management be fortified, but the equality and 
sovereignty of the republics will gain fresh mean-
Assuming these reforms do go through 
without major modification, economic devel-
opment and balance will become the primary 
responsibility of the republics, rather than the 
federal government. The knotty and poten-
tially disruptive issue of the north-south de-
velopment gap is to be dealt with apparently 
by placing even more responsibility upon- the 
underdeveloped republics themselves, al-
though long-term development financing will 
continue to be available, on a loan basis, 
through the Federal Fund for the Underde-
veloped Regions. In effect, these reforms 
signal the final demise of centrally-imposed 
egalitarianism in economic development and 
living standards and will institutionalize the 
development gap for many years to come. 
As such, they run counter to a significant body 
of opinion among the older (and now largely 
discredited) members of the party, as well as 
some idealistic young people. 
Perhaps there is no other choice. If Yugo-
slavia is to remain competitive in the world 
market (and thereby steadily to improve her 
overall standard of living) she must continue 
to release and encourage those sectors of her 
economy that can best compete in the world 
market. If these sectors happen to be lo-
cated for the most part in the more developed 
regions of Yugoslavia, so be it. Perhaps this 
harsh policy will somehow stimulate the re-
maining regions to make the efforts and sacri-
fices necessary to "catch up." But one is 
" B. Savic, "Self-Governed Federalism," Yugo-
slav Life, XVI, 1 (January, 1971), p. 2. 
entitled to wonder if there will continue to be 
a Yugoslavia within, which to catch up. 
Ultimately the key to Yugoslavia's future 
may lie in the realm of foreign relations, 
which have not been the focus of this article, 
but which may nonetheless provide a con-
cluding thought. For all the prejudices and 
resentments which set apart Yugoslays of 
differing natioinalities, there is still a strong 
loyalty to the "New Yugoslavia" as a polity 
that has succeeded in maintaining, over the 
past quarter-century, a precarious existence 
between East and West. The Yugoslav 
strategy of "active non-alignment," while it 
has fallen far short of its purpose of creating 
a coherent third world force in international 
politics, has still established an image of a 
unique Yugoslav role in world affairs. Re-
cent successful trade negotiations with both 
the European Common Market and Come-
con (the Soviet-bloc counterpart of E.E.C.) 
have further enhanced this image, as did the 
state visit of United States President Richard 
Nixon last fall. The restoration of full dip-
lomatic relations with Communist China, on 
the one hand, and the Vatican, on the other, 
were two very impressive Yugoslav initatives 
on the 1970 diplomatic calendar. President 
Tito played a central role in the Third Con-
ference of Non-Aligned Countries held in 
September in Zambia. Yugoslavia has 
clearly "arrived" as a medium power. 
The loyalty which Yugoslays feel for con-
temporary Yugoslavia is difficult to gauge. 
It certainly is not strong enough to prevent 
internal bickering. On the other hand, 
should foreign powers, or power blocs, at-
tempt to take advantage of the internal 
strains that surely lie ahead for Yugoslavia, 
there would probably be a compensatory rec-
onciliation among the feuding nationalities. 
In the last analysis, the future of the new 
Yugoslav nation-state may depend more on 
its environment than its internal workings.

THE COMMON FACTORS OF POLITICAL TERRORISM 
1. Political terror has different roots in different places, 
but whether in Latin America, Africa or the Middle East, it has 
soMe common factors: 
a. Unquestionably, the most fertile soil for its growth 
is in those countries where not only the possibilities of peace-
ful and legal change within the national system appear to be blocked, 
but also where the government shows itself unable to cope with elements 
of change and ynrest which emerge within the country. 
b. In recent years, and particularly following the failure 
and death of Che Guevara in Bolivia in October 1967, rural insurgency 
has become discredited as the most effective means of revolution, 
and thee has been a cerresponding rise in urban terrorism. In 
Uruguay and Guatemala especially, and elsewhere, as in Ceylon and 
Turkey, urban guerrillas are severely straining the political and 
social fabric of the nation. 
c. A third noteworthy and common phenomenon is the increased 
student participation in urban terrorist activities. In Turkey, for 
example, terrorist action hfis stemmed in large part from an off-
shoot of Dev Genc (Turkish Revolutionary Youth Federation). The 
moderate leaders of Dev Genc have been replaced by advocates of 
militant revolution calling themselves the Turkish Peoples Liberation 
Army. It was the activities of this group early this year which 
brought about the resignation of the government in March, and this 
same group is responsible for the kidnapping and assassination of 
the Israeli Consul General in Istanbul. 
d. The most significant common factor to the majority of 
these urban guerrilla groups is the support and training provided 
by established Communist powers. In Latin America, Cuba, and there-
fore by extension the Soviet Union, provides funds, training and 
propaganda support, and has even occasionally assigned its amn. 
experts to assigt guerrilla groups. The Soviet Union and, as more 
recently revealed, North Korea, and possibly East Germany, have also 
given training in subversion and armed violence to Latin American 
students. In Africa, the Cubans, Chinese Communists and the North 
Koreans have all been involved in providing support and training 
to members of insurgent groups. In the Middle East, the Soviets 
and Chinese Communists have supported and trained Arab commando 
uoups, while North Korean activity has recently been uncovered in 
Ceylon also. (tor further information on recent North Korean activity,
