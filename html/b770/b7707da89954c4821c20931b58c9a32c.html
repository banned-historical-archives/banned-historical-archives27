"What Does U.S. Big Debate 
On Red China Signify?" 
Full text of an editorial in the People's Daily published 
in Peiping on April 9, 1966. 
The so-called China question has 
become the focus of attention in the 
U.S. in the past two months. U.S. 
scholars and idea men in the service 
of the ruling classes, and responsible 
officials, have put forth their views in 
a great debate on China policy. 
Beginning from the latter part of 
January, the House Far East and West 
Pacific Sub-Committee held a num-
ber of public hearings on China 
policy. From the beginning of March, 
the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee invited a number of "experts 
on the China question" to give testi-
mony. Discussions on the "China 
question" have also been held in 
American universities, "learned so-
cieties" and other "non-governmental" 
bodies, and among religionists. The 
U.S. President and some high of-
ficials have also spoken on China 
policy on many occasions. 
This is a continuation of the de-
bate on the Vietnam question some 
time ago. 
The consequences arising from the 
constant escalation of the war of ag-
gression in Vietnam by the Johnson 
administration are the immediate 
cause for the discussion on the 
"China question." This aggressive ad-
venture has not only met with strong 
opposition from the American people 
but also aroused anxiety among cer-
tain sections of the U.S. ruling circles. 
They fear that this would lead to a 
"clash with China" and that such a 
"clash" will be for the U.S. "the 
worst possible catastrophe that could 
develop in the rest of this century." 
There is a more profund reason 
why the China policy is so widely dis-
cussed in the United States. The U.S. 
imperialist policy of hostility towards 
China has failed to prevent China 
from advancing by leaps and bounds 
along the path of socialist revolution 
and socialist construction and to check 
the ever expanding influence of the 
Chinese revolution. 
The anti-China betrayal of the re-
visionist Soviet leadership does not 
help the United States at all. China, 
which holds high the banner of anti-
imperialism, has become the greatest 
insurmountable obstacle to the execu-
tion of the counter-revolutionary glo-
bal strategy of U.S. imperialism. U.S. 
Assistant Secretary of State for Far 
Eastern Affairs William Bundy said 
on February 21 that the foreign policy 
aims of China and the U.S. are "total-
ly antithetic" and there is "a very 
fundamental conflict" between them. 
He admitted that "Communist China 
is without doubt the most serious and 
perplexing problem that confronts our 
foreign policy today." 
It can thus be seen that the present 
debate reflects not the "powerfulness" 
of the U.S. but its weakness and de-
feat and its helplessness and dilemma 
in face of the great Chinese people. 
Some influential Americans criticised 
U.S.-China policy as "in a fundamen-
tal sense unsuccessful" and "long since 
out of date". They called for a 
"fundamental review of our China 
policy." It is against such a back-
ground that the Johnson administra-
tion wants to make use of the debate 
as a smokescreen to sidetrack the 
strong dissatisfaction at home and 
abroad with the U.S. anti-China policy 
and to cover up the continuance of the 
policy of hostility and aggression 
against China.

The debate shows that the differ- Committee hearing on March 8 that 
ence between these idea men is about while sticking to its military "con-
what counter-revolutionary method tainment" of China, the U.S. should 
should be adopted. They are at one aim at "maximum contacts with and 
in persisting in the policy of hostility maximum involvement of the Chinese 
and aggression towards China. That Communists in the international corn-
is why none of them could put forth munity." This idea was very favorably 
a feasible formula. After repeated received in American political guar-
deliberations and consideration, the ters. U.S. Vice-President Hubert 
experts ended in agreeing to the con- Humphrey said in a speech on March 
tinuation and stepping up of the 19, "we must achieve the contain-
"containment" policy. They added the ment of Asian communism without 
phrase "without isolation" after the isolating the Chinese people." The 
word "containment", hence the so- idea of "dual approach" advanced by 
called formula "containment without Professor Donald Zagoria, another 
isolation." Columbia University "expert on 
Let's see what kind of stuff this China", amounts to the same thing. 
formula is. 
The "containment" policy is the 
core of the U.S. China policy. News-
week of March 7 said, "the necessity 
for containment of China has become 
an axiom of U.S. foreign policy." 
Since taking office, the Johnson ad-
ministration has pushed this policy a 
step forward. It has openly declared 
that China is the principal enemy of 
the United States, and has shifted the 
focus of its global strategy from 
Europe to Asia. Besides building up 
more vigorously the "crescent defense 
line" stretching from South Korea to 
Thailand, it pins its hopes more and 
more on collusion with the Khrush-
chev revisionists, Japanese militarists 
and Indian reactionaries to "contain" 
China. William Bundy said in his 
February 21 speech that the "con-
tainment" of China "is the essence 
of what we are trying to do." 
There is also an aim in the U.S. 
policy of "containment" which can-
not be made public. By raising the 
anti-China black banner, the U.S. 
wants further to tighten its control 
over the countries around China, sup-
press the revolutionary movements in 
these countries and turn them into 
U.S. military bases. 
What then is "without isolation" all 
about? A. Doak Barnett, acting di-
rector of Columbia University's East 
Asian Institute, said as the first wit-
ness at the Senate Foreign Relations 
In reality, the "containment with-
out isolation" formula is a manifes-
tation of the U.S. imperialist counter-
revolutionary dual tactics on China 
policy. In short, this means on the one 
hand continued aggression against and 
encirclement of China, containment 
and isolation of China, while on the 
other, indulging in the vain hope to 
bring about "peaceful evolution" in 
China so that revolutionary China will 
degenerate gradually. "Containment" 
is the main thing in the dual tactics. 
Commenting on this formula, the 
Christian Science Monitor said on 
March 6 that the U.S. policy of "con-
taining" China militarily "has not 
changed. On the contrary, it has stif-
fened as a result of the war in Viet-
nam." But the Johnson government 
wanted this policy "applied together 
with a long-range political policy" to 
"lead them (Chinese Communists) 
down the path that the Russians fol-
lowed between Stalin and Brezhnev, 
away from violence and toward an 
enforced responsibility." This reveals 
the counter-revolutionary character 
of the policy of "containment without 
isolation." 
But U.S. imperialism has found a 
wrong target. The Chinese people 
have long seen through the aggressive 
nature of U.S. imperialism. Whether 
by its "tough" tactics or by its "soft" 
tactics or by the simultaneous appli-
cation of both tactics, U.S. imperial-

ism cannot hope to browbeat or de- sell had to admit that as far as the 
ceive the Chinese people. Even the 
U.S. ruling circles themselves are not 
sure whether or not these tactics will 
bear fruit. William Bundy said on 
March 16 that insofar as the policy 
of "containment without isolation" 
was concerned, the United States had 
been acting on it for sometime. But 
he admitted that there was no indica-
tion that China would change its 
policy. 
Helplessly and hopelessly, Harvard 
Professor John K. Fairbank, the so-
called veteran "China specialist", and 
others again put forward the long 
discredited "two Chinas" formula. 
Some others proposed that "uncondi-
tional discussions" be held and "diplo-
matic relations" established with 
China before the future of Taiwan is 
discussed. But even Dean Rusk him-
"two Chinas" proposal was concerned, 
"it was useless" because China had re-
jected it. 
U.S. imperialism's persistent hostili-
ty towards the Chinese people is 
determined by its reactionary and ag-
gressive nature. There is nothing 
strange about it. What is strange is 
that U.S. imperialism even hopes to 
find a "way out" of the blind alley 
of its China policy. The great debate 
in the United States over Washing-
ton's China policy shows once again 
that it is mere illusion. Look, how 
many politicians, "scholars" and "spe-
cialists" took part in these discussions. 
But nothing fruitful has come out of 
them. Nor will there be any result if 
more discussions are held. Gentlemen 
in Washington, there is nothing you 
can do about it! 
Members of the 89th Congress who have endorsed the Committee of One Mil-
lion's Declaration against any concessions to Communist China: the admission 
of Communist China to the U. N.; United States diplomatic recognition of the 
Peiping regime; trade relations between the United States and Communist 
China; any policy of accommodation which might be interpreted as U. S. acqui-
escence in, or approval of, Communist China's aggression, direct or indirect, 
against her neighbors.

About this pamphlet . . 
? 
Early in 1966, the Committee of One Million published a pamphlet en-
titled "RED CHINA SPEAKS: An Examination Of Communist China's 
Attitudes On War And Peace In Its Own Words". The publication quoted 
a number of official statements made by the Peiping regime as an indication 
of the futility of attempting to deal with Communist China in a rational and 
civilized manner. 
Notwithstanding the attitude of Red China's leaders, there have been 
increasing efforts during the past months ? well-publicized and well-
financed ? to change present American policy toward Communist China: 
withdrawal of United States opposition to the admission of Communist 
China to the United Nations; unilateral American action which would lead 
to full diplomatic recognition of Peiping; dropping all barriers to trade 
and other "exchanges" with Red China. This growing campaign is being 
carried on in the face of Communist Chinese aggression in Southeast Asia 
and at the same time as young Americans are being shot down by Chinese 
Communist bullets in Vietnam! 
Each day, newspapers report on some new statement urging unilateral 
American concessions to Communist China. These emanate from various 
academic groups, religious bodies, editorialists, organizations concerned 
with foreign affairs and "civil rights," and from a few Senators and Con-
gressmen. This minority point of view ? rehashing old and defunct ideas 
? is presented as part of a great American "debate" on United States-
China policy. 
Unhappily for those who urge changes in present American policy, the 
Chinese Communists simply refuse to cooperate. Americans have been 
hearing the arguments of those who would offer practically unlimited con-
cessions to Communist China. It is important that Americans also know the 
attitude of the Chinese Communists. 
What follows is the text of an editorial in the People's Daily (the official 
mouthpiece of the Peiping regime) which was published on April 9, 1966. 
In the article, the Chinese Communist regime replied in no uncertain terms 
to the current domestic debate on U.S.-China policy. It denounced the 
"containment without isolation" formula as "a manifestation of the U.S. 
imperialist counter-revolutionary dual tactics on China policy." Mentioning 
the House and Senate hearings and the academic discussions, it charged 
that the Johnson administration wanted to make use of the debate "as a 
smokescreen to sidetrack the strong dissatisfatcion at home and abroad with 
the U.S. anti-China policy." It attacked everyone, including Prof. John K. 
Fairbank, who was described as "helplessly and hopelessly" promoting 
the long discredited "Two Chinas" policy. All these so-called "experts," it 
sniffed, were Washington's "idea men," seeking to perpetuate these "dual 
tactics." 
The Committee of One Million is reprinting this editorial in full as a sup-
plement to its earlier pamphlet and for the benefit of those Americans who 
seem convinced that the leaders of Communist China can somehow be 
made to behave in a responsible and peaceful manner.

Introduction 
THE WAR in Vietnam has brought 
into sharper focus the perennial 
question of Communist China; the 
question, that is, of what should be 
done?if anything?about admission 
to the United Nations, diplomatic 
recognition, increased trade, cultural 
exchange. 
In this connection, it is astonishing 
to note how little things have changed 
since the late 1940s when Mao Tse-
tung & Co. were helped to power by 
the band of China experts in the 
Institute of Pacific Relations (IPR) 
and in the State Department. 
Then they were saying that the 
Chinese Communists were merely 
agrarian reformers and that the ele-
ment in China to be most concerned 
about was the "corrupt" Chiang Kai-
shek and the warloads. Our China 
experts of the left-Liberal persua-
sion helped the Communists seize a 
continent. 
Now they are concerned with le-
gitimizing the Red China regime in 
the concert of nations. Their help is 
being extended precisely at the time 
when Communist China finds its 
fortunes at low ebb?at home and 
abroad, economically and diplomat-
ically. 
These friends and members of the 
Red China lobby point to the Soviet 
Union as a happy example of the 
co-existence spirit which the free 
world might expect from Communist 
China, if only the mainland regime 
were accorded the minimal interna-
tional courtesies?diplomatic recogni-
tion, admission to the United Nations, 
expanded trade. 
The final abandonment of National-
ist China which such a policy would 
entail creates no crisis of conscience 
among these self-described realists, 
for the main enemy in the Far East 
continues to be Chiang Kai-shek. 
One of the ironies of the situation 
lies in the fact that the very people 
who in large measure are personally 
and historically responsible for the 
political disaster on the Chinese 
514 NATIONAL REVIEW 
mainland are today hailed as experts 
by the communications media, the 
universities and important members 
of the Congress. 
Thus, despite the brilliant and 
scholarly exposure of the IPR and its 
collaborators by the Senate Internal 
Security Subcommittee more than a 
decade ago, once again we hear the 
confident voices of such experts as 
Owen Lattimore, John K. Fairbank, 
John Stewart Service and Oliver 
Edmund Clubb. A sorry confirmation 
of Hegel's observation to the effect 
that the one thing we learn from 
history is that we do not learn from 
history! 
The recent hearings by the House 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
furnished a platform for many 
spokesmen for the Red China lobby, 
all of whom peddled the new line 
of "containment without isolation," 
the now fashionable euphemism for 
appeasement. 
The Opposition 
Fortunately, the hearings also fea-
tured testimony by some spokesmen 
for a realistic approach to the China 
question. Among these, four in par-
ticular developed a vigorous and 
closely reasoned rebuttal to the 
vagaries of the Red China lobby. The 
four are: Professor David Nelson 
Rowe of Yale University, former Rep-
resentative Walter H. Judd, Profes-
sor Franz Michael of Georgetown 
University and Professor George E. 
Taylor of the University of Washing-
ton. 
?David Rowe is a professor in the 
Department of International Studies 
at Yale University. He was born in 
Nanking, China and worked with the 
OSS during World War II. He was 
a special assistant to the U.S. Am-
bassador to China. He taught at Tai-
wan University from 1954-1956; was 
a member of the international sec-
retariat of the United Nations Found-
THEODORE LIT 
ing Conference in San Francisco in 
1945. Among his books is Modern 
China: A Brief History. 
?Walter Judd was a medical mis-
sionary in China from 1925 to 1938. 
He returned to the United States 
with his family in '38 and spent the 
next two years lecturing to church 
groups around the country on the 
dangers of Japanese imperialism. He 
was elected to the 78th Congress from 
the Fifth Congressional District in 
Minnesota and served through the 
82nd Congress. He was a U.S. dele-
gate to the 12th session of the UN 
General Assembly; one of the found-
ers of the Committee of One Mil-
lion against Admission of Red China 
to the United Nations. He speaks 
Chinese fluently and knows person-
ally most of the influential Chinese 
leaders, both Nationalist and Com-
munist. 
?Franz Michael taught in Hangchow, 
China from 1934 to 1938. From 1942 
to 1964 he was professor of Far East-
ern History and Government and as-
sistant director of the Far Eastern 
and Russian Institute at the Univer-
sity of Washington. He is now pro-
fessor of International Affairs and 
Sino-Soviet Studies at George Wash-
ington University. Among his pub-
lications is The Origin of Manchu 
Rule in China. He has just published 
the first part of a three-part docu-
mentary history of the Taiping Re-
bellion. 
?George Taylor is Director of the 
Far Eastern and Russian Institute of 
the University of Washington. He 
lived and taught in China from 1930 
to 1939. During World War II he 
served as a China expert in the State 
Department. He is the author of a 
number of books on the Far East, 
including The Struggle for North 
China and America in the New 
Pacific. He is the co-author (with 
Franz Michael) of The Far East in 
the Modern World.

tellectual community, their testimony 
articulates American public opinion 
on Red China (an opinion mobilized 
in large degree, since 1953, by the 
Committee of One Million). 
Significantly, the national platforms 
of the Democratic and Republican 
parties oppose the admission of Red 
China to the UN; a Gallup poll of 
January, 1966 shows 67 per cent of 
the American people are opposed to 
the admission of Red China to the 
UN; the Congress has repeatedly gone 
on record opposing concessions to 
Peking. 
All of which opens the nagging 
question: Why does the Liberal Es-
tablishment pursue an appeasement 
policy toward Communist regimes? 
The appeasement policy is not based 
on a principled pacifism, in view of 
the fact that the Liberals enthusi-
astically supported the war against 
Nazi Germany. Nor does the appease-
ment policy spring exclusively from 
a fear of a mutually destructive nu-
clear war. It should be remembered 
that the Liberals also pushed for an 
appeasement line during the early 
postwar period when the United 
States enjoyed a monopoly of nuclear 
bombs. 
The answer is indirectly suggested 
in a statement by Senator J. W. Ful-
bright in the first of his Johns Hop-
kins University lectures. Commenting 
on the national debate on the Viet-
nam war, the chairman of the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee warned: 
"It is by no means certain that the 
relatively healthy atmosphere in 
which the debate is now taking place 
will not give way to fears, and toler-
ance and freedom of discussion will 
give way to a false and strident 
patriotism." 
Senator Fulbright's qualification of 
patriotism is not to be taken too liter-
ally. This is the Aesopian language 
of the modern, sophisticated Liberal. 
For it is patriotism?normal, healthy 
patriotism?which propels the aver-
age American to oppose international 
Communism. And it is this normal 
healthy patriotism which, in the 
nature of things, would be heightened 
in the course of a genuine, all-out 
struggle against international Com-
munism. The Liberal senses the vio-
lent contradiction between patriotism 
?of any degree?and the intellectual 
power position of the Establishment. 
It is patriotism?more than Commun-
ism?which the Liberal Establish-
ment sees as the main enemy. 
The China Problem Today in 
United States Policy-Making 
THE KOREAN WAR proved that Com-
munist China was willing to fight the 
Free World in order to achieve Com-
munist expansionist aims in Asia vis-
et-vis Korea (Japan was the real 
objective and the most important 
one). 
The formula has been repeated in: 
Tibet?anti-India and Nehru. 
Laos-250,000 Chinese Communist 
troops massed on the Laos frontier 
in 1961-1962 to bring a settlement 
favorable to Communist China.

actual Sino-Indian war, with Com-
munist Chinese troops fighting Indian 
troops. 
Communist Chinese support for 
North Vietnam aggression against 
South Vietnam. The Sino-Russian 
ploy: North Vietnam (the North 
To be sure, there is always the 
possibility that normal, healthy patri-
otism, under a condition of great in-
ternational stress, may be trans-
formed into ?the "false and strident" 
patriotism that Fulbright evokes. It 
is this added risk from which the 
Liberal particularly shrinks, prefer-
ring instead, through an appeasement 
policy, the risk of a Communism 
triumphant. 
If this be so, there can be no genuine 
debate between the Liberal and the 
anti-Communist communities. Yet it 
is important that the formal argu-
ment against appeasing Communist 
China be widely disseminated. For 
the argument finally finds its way to 
grassroots Americans and fortifies 
them in their conviction that there 
is no substitute for victory. And it 
does correct the thinking of those 
members of the Liberal Establish-
ment who are sensitive to the persua-
sive power of right reason. 
Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, 
the press, radio and television gave 
only meager coverage to the genu-
inely expert testimony of these wit-
nesses. In the interest of fuller re-
portage, the thrust of their polemic 
is reproduced in this Special Supple-
ment.

Korea of this episode) is immune 
from destruction at the hands of the 
United States and its allies, because 
of its joint Sino-Soviet backing. Com-
munist China stands behind North 
Vietnam's aggression militarily, to 
prevent such military action against 
North Vietnam as is necessary to 
the attainment of our military objec-
tives in and for South Vietnam. 
Thus, Communist China achieves for 
North Vietnam immunity from the 
consequences of its aggression in 
South Vietnam which the previous 
Sino-Soviet techniques and strategies 
of support for North Korea failed to 
achieve, and this without any cost 
thus far in Communist Chinese man-
power. 
Thus, Sino-Soviet "indirect" ag-
gression in South Vietnam depends 
upon their joint success in prevent-
ing the United States from taking 
military action against North Viet-
nam adequate to achieve the defense 
of South Vietnamese independence. 
The chief Sino-Soviet weapon in 
this psychological warfare struggle is 
the threat of massive Chinese man-
power intervening as "people's vol-
unteers" in the Vietnamese war. 
To mitigate the risks of Communist 
China's Southeast Asia policy is the 
aim of all true friends of Communist 
China in the U.S.A. today. Many 
others aid and abet this aim for a 
variety of reasons. 
Thus, almost immediately after the 
Johnson policy of heavy, direct 
United States military involvement 
in the Vietnamese war was initiated,

gan to emerge from the relative 
obscurity into which they had been 
forced by the Communist Chinese 
attack on us in Korea and to start 
openly supporting Communist China 
again and attacking the United States 
Far Eastern policy at the same time. 
These movements, so patently anti-
anti-Communist, seem to have forced 
the Administration to speak as though 
Communism by and large was not 
involved in the Vietnamese war, thus 
robbing us of one of the chief psy-
chological supports and chief political 
bases of the war in Vietnam and the 
such as the Secretary of State and 
Secretary of Defense (much of whose 
testimony has to be classified). This 
show then goes on radio and TV 
(highly edited toward the Left). The 
whole effect is to depict public "ex-
perts" as at odds with the Adminis-
tration. This not only convinces the 
Communists in Hanoi, Peking and 
Moscow of divisions of opinion in the 
United States that do not exist in 
fact. It also seems to drive the 
Administration toward public posi-
tions on Communist China that con-
tradict its public position that the 
whole war against Communist ag-
gression everywhere. This is clearly 
seen in President Johnson's Balti-
more speech and even more so in 
his recent speech at Freedom House, 
New York where he uses "Red" and 
"Communist" just once each in the 
whole speech, playing down Com-
munism as an issue in the Vietnam 
war. 
The purpose of the anti-anti-Com-
munists here is clear, namely to try 
to show that the war in Vietnam 
has no valid ideological basis and 
thus to depict it as naked United 
States aggression without any justi-
fication. Who sold President Johnson 
the line of de-emphasizing Commun-
ism as an issue in the Vietnamese 
war? 
Paralleling these movements are 
the hearings in the Senate which 
seem to aim at two main effects: 
1) To align selected civilian propa-
gandists uniformly against the main 
lines ?of United States foreign policy 
in Asia and then to bring to rebut 
them the main Administration figures 
516 NATIONAL REVIEW 
war in Vietnam could soon be ended 
if only Communist Chinese attitudes 
and measures would change. It also 
seems to lead members of jthe Admin-
istration to start softening their policy 
of resistance to Communist China by 
talking "containment without isola-
tion" and to that extent undercutting 
the Administration's own experts such 
as Secretary of State Rusk and As-
sistant Secretary for Far Eastern 
Affairs William Bundy. 
2) To have a main effect of soften-
ing our resistance to Communist 
China. Senator Fulbright himself 
states that the main aim of his hear-
ings on China is a political aim, 
namely to prevent a war with Com-
munist China. 
In fact, the prevention of a mili-
tary showdown now between the 
United States and Communist China 
is the main aim of Communists every-
where. Why? 
If such a showdown came soon it 
would destroy Communist China as 
such and constitute the single most 
catastrophic setback in history to the 
course of the Communist world re-
volution. In the course of such an 
event, however, the USSR would as-
suredly grab both Manchuria and 
Sinkiang, in order to have those 
Chinese areas available as bases to 
start over again the job of commun-
izing east Asia. But the rest of China 
could be saved, without doubt. 
If such a showdown can be pre-
vented for five to ten more years, 
the pro-Communist-China and anti-
anti-Communist elements in this 
country count on the development of 
Communist Chinese thermonuclear 
power to produce a standoff and 
make Communist China then invul-
nerable to United States destruction, 
by means of the retaliatory threat. 
They could prolong this stage ten 
to twenty years during which either 
one and probably both of two things 
would happen: 
The United States would prove 
unable to develop any effective deter-
rent to so-called "indirect aggression" 
and "people's war" with the result 
that all of Asia would come under 
Chinese Communist domination and 
control and the impact on Africa and 
Latin America would be disastrous. 
Under the deterrent of terror the 
political and psychological pressures 
toward a d?nte with Communist 
China similar to present illusions 
along that line with the USSR, would 
engender a thorough and complete 
co-existence policy vis-?is the 
Communist Chinese. 
The Communist Chinese need co-
existence much worse than do the 
Russians. Why? The lack of massive 
external support and their huge and 
insoluble internal problems doom 
them forever to weakness and medi-
ocrity and complete totalitarianism 
and military adventurism. They are 
trying their hardest now to soften 
our approach to them under the 
blackmail of aggression and war, to 
gain at no cost to them politically 
what they need in outside economic 
and technical support from the West 
and particularly from the U.S.A. This 
is why their friends in the United 
States are trying so hard to soften 
the American approach to Commu-
nist China. 
What are the main themes now be-
ing pushed by the pro-Communist 
China and anti-anti-Communist ele-
ments along this line? 
(Theme) The historical causation

CIA-RDP73-00475R000102940003-9 
line. The Communist Chinese foreign 
policies are merely a logical result of 
China's frustrations and suffering at 
the hands of the outside world for 
the last century or more. 
(Theme) The "inevitable softening 
of the Communist Chinese." This 
line is pushed hard by all the pro-
Communist-China and anti-anti-
Communist elements. Even Fidel 
Castro gives them aid and comfort by 
blasting the current Chinese Com-
munist leaders as "senile" and anti-
cipating a less dangerous Communist 
Chinese leadership to come with the 
demise of Mao. 
(Theme) The "two-Chinas" line. 
This is tantamount to saying we can 
play with enemies without alienating 
friends. Whatever the distant future 
holds we cannot know. But for the 
responsible policy-making future 
there can be no two-Chinas policy for 
the United States or anyone else. For 
example, the United Kingdom has 
tried to adopt a two-Chinas policy: 
recognition of Peking and trying to 
do business with Taipei. Result: it 
has neither China. The Communist 
Chinese have never entered full dip-
lomatic relations with the United 
Kingdom, and the United Kingdom 
cannot really cooperate with the Re-
public of China, or Taiwan, the single 
most rapidly advancing and develop-
ing area in Asia. By contrast, the 
United States without recognition of 
Peking has much higher-level diplo-
matic contacts with the Chinese Com-
munists than Britain, and is the main 
ally and collaborator with the Re-
public of China on Taiwan. 
Hard and Soft 
Question: Can any United States 
Administration advocate abandonment 
of the Republic of China without 
committing political suicide? 
Answer: This is what two-Chinas 
policy advocates really are urging the 
Administration toward, some know-
ingly and others unwittingly. I.e. the 
two-Chinas policy means to start full 
diplomatic and other relations with 
Communist China, and with a trend 
toward this once set in motion we 
can more easily abandon the Republic 
of China on Taiwan, particularly since 
it would break relations with us if 
we recognized Communist China. 
(Theme) The "they don't mean 
what they say" line. Anyone who be-
lieves in drawing the lessons of his-
tory should not object if we say the 
world would have been better off if 
more people had taken seriously such 
historical documents as the Marxist 
Manifesto, Hitler's Mein Kampf or 
the pre-World War II utterances of 
the Japanese imperialists. The cur-
rent utterances of the Communist 
Chinese leadership seem just as dan-
gerously unrealistic today as the pre-
viously cited ones did then. They are 
therefore hard to give credence to. 
They are, in fact, filled with non-
sense, but then of course so too was 
Mein Kampf! But this is merely to 
say that all madmen are dangerous, 
to a great extent precisely because 
they are mad. 
Questions: When men talk madness 
(as the Communist Chinese do) would 
it not be wise to assume they mean 
it until and unless they prove other-
wise by their acts? Yes. Are the Com-
munist Chinese proving otherwise by 
their acts? No?they do just the op-
posite. Witness: Korea, the Taiwan 
Straits, the Indian frontier, Laos, and 
Thailand, as well as Vietnam. ? 
(Theme) The "simultaneous hard 
and soft" line: "containment, but not 
isolation." The friends of Communist 
China and the anti-anti-Communists 
are constantly describing our post-
World War II policy toward the USSR 
as combining these two features and 
advocating that we adopt such a 
policy toward Communist China. 
What is thetruth? 
Our immediate postwar policy to-
ward the USSR was not one of con-
tainment, but of surrender. Eastern 
Europe and Outer Mongolia were 
surrendered to the USSR with' the 
connivance of the U.S. and the highest 
pressures being brought to bear by 
the U.S. on our allies to surrender 
to the USSR land grabs, as in the 
case of Nationalist China and of Mon-
golia. This was an effort to appease 
Stalin and get him to accept this as 
his price for cooperating with us. He 
took the bribe, but did not cooperate. 
The containment policy was then 
resorted to and it has prevented fur-
ther territorial takeover. However, 
this whole policy is now threatened 
by French action in re NATO, and 
the chief deterrent to armed action 
by the USSR in Europe is now the 
mutual thermonuclear threat. 
Accordingly, we have generally not 
applied the policy of surrender of ter-
ritory to Communist China, and in 
every case but one have resisted 
Communist Chinese efforts to push 
outward. This case was Laos in 1961-
62, and much of our trouble in Viet-
nam stems from the application to 
Laos of the formula of appeasement 
and surrender through the device we 
tried to use in China (1946-47) to 
prevent a Communist Chinese take-
over pure and simple, i.e. the coali-
tion government with Communists in 
it. Sino-Soviet cooperation helped 
bring about the surrender in Laos 
and thus to mark out South Vietnam 
and Thailand as the most likely Com-
munist targets. 
As far as Communist China is con-
cerned containment means isolation: 
the two are one and inseparable and 
the crux of this problem is Taiwan. 
The Communist Chinese price for 
non-isolation (which is a two-sided 
matter, not solely under our control) 
is the handing over of Taiwan to 
them, i.e. destruction of containment. 
Any United States Administration 
which would even suggest any such 
thing would commit political suicide 
by producing a major catastrophe in 
Asian affairs. 
What About Our Allies? 
(Theme) The "there is no support 
among our allies" for our Southeast 
Asian policy line. This line was, for 
example, advanced in re the Japanese 
by that great authority (?) on Ja-
panese affairs, Mr. George Kennan. 
Mr. Kennan today seems to know 
even less about Far Eastern affairs 
than he did seventeen years ago, when 
I asked him what Asia would mean 
in our future struggle with Com-
munism. He replied then that the 
struggle with Communism would be 
settled somewhere along a line drawn 
between Stettin in the north and 
Trieste in the south. Of course, since 
then we have had Greece and Turkey 
in Europe; Korea, the Taiwan Straits, 
and the 17th parallel in Vietnam, not 
to mention Laos, and the Indian fron-
tier, in Asia. 
The Japanese people will respect 
and honor success on our part in 
Vietnam. Like others, they view with 
apprehension any irresolution, lack of 
determination, or willingness to pull 
out and surrender, on our part. This 
is generally true of all Asians, from

Japan clear around through Korea, 
Taiwan, the Philippines, Southeast 
Asia and South Asia. This is one of 
many reasons why we cannot and 
must not fail in Vietnam. 
Other friends and allies, including 
Korea, the Republic of China, the 
Philippines, Australia and New Zea-
land, are all helping in various ways 
in Vietnam, and will doubtless help 
still more in the future. If and when 
the need arises, the arrangements 
have no doubt already been worked 
out for the Republic of China, on Tai-
wan, to become directly involved. But, 
whether this will be required only 
time can tell. 
As to allies and friends in Europe 
and elsewhere the vast preponder-
ance of them approve what we are 
doing whether they say so or not. 
Secretary Rusk is right on this. 
What Price Knowledge? 
Indeed the notion that to know the 
Chinese Communists better will make 
it easier for us to tolerate them is 
no more true than if we were to say 
that to know Italy better would make 
it easier for us to tolerate the Mafia. 
The fact is we already know enough 
about both the Mafia and the Chinese 
Communists to know one thing, and 
that is that we do not need to know 
any more in order to justify our poli-
cies of opposition and hostility. Of 
course we can always use more 
knowledge on what can be described 
as a tactical level, such, for example, 
as is being supplied by U-2 over-
flights from Taiwan. But we are not 
likely to learn much from proposals 
to allow our scholars and students of 
China to visit Communist China, and 
for two reasons: 
1. The Chinese Communists are not 
going to allow anyone to visit there 
unless they are convinced that he is 
a dependable friend of Communism 
and of Chinese Communism, in par-
ticular. They have been following this 
policy for years. 
2. Under these circumstances what 
knowledge is brought back is likely 
to be either superficial or biased along 
pro-Chinese Communist lines. 
Even in the USSR, as my colleague 
Professor Barghoorn [of Yale, who 
was imprisoned by the Soviets for 
a fortnight] could no doubt testify, 
efforts at objective fact-gathering by 
foreign scholars are not without their 
518 NATIONAL REVIEW 
risks! The hazards to life involved in 
even minor contacts with the utterly 
incompatible, are clear from the re-
cent death of an innocent American 
traveler [Newcomb Mott] while in the 
hands of the Russians. The subsequent 
warnings to such potential travelers 
by the State Department were well 
merited. 
The campaign along the lines ana-
lyzed above is being carried out in 
this country at a pitch of intensity 
unmatched in recent propaganda his-
tory. The so-called "teach-in" more 
extensively used in the earlier phases 
of the anti-Vietnam-war campaign, 
has not been emphasized in this one. 
Instead, full-blown new organizations 
have been established on a nation-
wide basis, including ARFEP, or 
"Americans for a Review of Far East-
ern Policy." This organization was 
started on the Yale campus by a 
group of students and faculty mem-
bers. It has been spread across the 
country from there by a well-manned 
group of promoters and organizers. 
Recently a large advertisement ad-
vancing its views appeared, for ex-
ample, in a San Francisco newspaper, 
as emanating from the "Northern 
California Chapter" of ARFEP. 
Certain features of this organiza-
tion appear very clearly. For example, 
what they mean by a "review" of our 
Far Eastern policy usually turns out 
to be nothing but propaganda in fa-
vor of Communist China in the shape 
of support for its admission to the 
United Nations, United Sthtes recog-
nition of the Red regime, full United 
States relations in trade, cultural re-
lations, etc., well calculated to ad-
vance the aims, purposes, and in-
terests of Communist China. This pro-
paganda also, at times, is heavily in 
derogation of our ally, the Republic 
of China, of President and Madame 
Chiang Kai-shek, etc. 
Second, the main centers of or-
ganization and the main personnel in-
volved are the colleges and universi-
ties. I do not know how many ARFEP 
centers and branches there are, or 
how many persons have "signed up" 
or are otherwise formally or infor-
mally affiliated with them. Nor can 
we fully know at present just what 
activities they engage in. The follow-
ing is no doubt an incomplete list of 
activities: signing petitions and plac-
ing advertisements in newspapers; 
holding small and unadvertised "semi-
nars" conducted by faculty members 
on China and China policy; sponsor-
ing open debates on China policy 
questions, with both sides represented 
(a minor feature); conducting what 
amounts to a speaker's bureau to sup-
ply speakers from one campus to 
another. 
It should be noted that at the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania conference, 
not a single academic expert on 
China will be present to speak on the 
program in favor of the official United 
States policy toward Communist 
China. This defense is relegated to of-
ficial representatives of the United 
States.- Government and of the Re-
public of China. This repeats the pat-
tern so clearly seen elsewhere, of 
putting up as academic "experts" on 
China only those in opposition to the 
official policy, and "balancing" them 
with "official spokesmen" who can be 
discounted in advance as such. Thus, 
the false impression is created that 
the "public," represented by the aca-
demic experts, is uniformly opposed 
to the policy of our government at 
this time. This is false, utterly false. 
Owen Lattimore Again 
At a conference at Harvard under 
the auspices of the Collegiate Council 
for the United Nations on March 25-
27, Professor Owen Lattimore of In-
stitute of Pacific Relations fame was 
scheduled to speak on "The Chinese 
Revolution: Causes and Conse-
quences." 
Also, from an organizational point 
of view, new and political uses are 
being made of an organization that 
predictably would be used for pro-
Chinese Communist purposes if and 
when the time comes to do so. This 
is the Association of Asian Studies. 
When I say its current political uses 
are predictable, I mean just that. I 
refer you to my statement on this 
organization made in testimony un-
der oath before the Internal Security 
Subcommittee of the Senate Commit-
tee on the Judiciary, on March 27, 
1952 (pp. 4010-4013). I referred then 
to the Far Eastern Association, which 
is now the Association of Asian 
Studies, and I characterized it as de-
signed, at least in part, to take over 
the political propaganda functions of 
the Institute of Pacific Relations in 
case the latter institution came to

CIA-RDP73-00475R000102940003-9 
grief, as I believe it subsequently did, 
over questions of the pro-Communist 
bias of its activities. 
What the New York Times will 
print is well exemplified by the letter 
in its columns for March 18, 1966 by 
Professor Vera M. Dean of New York 
University. In this letter the profes-
sor, while expressing her views on 
various policy matters, also expresses 
her hopes. Among these, as she puts 
it, is that the "ghosts," as she de-
scribes them, of "Senator McCarthy 
and the Committee of One Million on 
China" should be "exorcised," and 
that former "China experts" who she 
says were driven from the State De-
partment by "McCarthyism" should 
be sought out to advise the President 
and Secretary Rusk. Leaving this 
latter point aside, the Professor 
should be informed that before she 
can exorcise the "ghost" of the Com-
mittee of One Million it will have to 
die and produce such a ghost. Far 
from dying, the Committee is very 
much alive today, and shows no signs 
of atrophy. All reports to the contrary 
are highly premature, to say the least. 
In this situation and from this back-
ground, in what policy area should 
our best and strongest efforts be 
made, to counter the current attempts 
to support Communist China and its 
program for Asia and the world? We 
are talking here, of course, of United 
States policy alternatives. 
I do not believe the matter of pos-
sible United States recognition, trade 
and cultural relations, etc. is central. 
It is quite doubtful that, under cur-
rent circumstances, any Administra-
tion in Washington would move to-
ward such policies. More real is the 
danger that we will succumb to the 
admission of Communist China to the 
United Nations. In fact, so central do 
I believe this whole question to be to 
the problem of "standing up to Com-
munist China's grandiose demands" 
in world affairs, as Professor John 
Fairbank puts it, that I believe here 
is where major emphasis should lie 
in respect to China policy today. 
Let us see why the Chinese Com-
munists should not be admitted to the 
United Nations. 
What was the origin of the United 
Nations? 
The United Nations originated as an 
association of victors in World War 
II. It excluded the soon-to-be-de-
feated powers, Germany, Italy, and 
Japan. In its very origins it was thus 
exclusive, not universal. The essential 
feature was the wartime association 
of the wartime allies, the "United 
Nations," and the community of in-
terests that that alliance embodied. 
The United Nations: what for? 
The United Nations was founded in 
the hope of peace and to search for 
it. The functional approach was adopt-
ed, i.e. cooperation wherever possible, 
in whatever measures possible. Meas-
ures were to be taken for common 
and mutual security. The problem of 
expanding the United Nations mem-
bership arose at the United Nations 
Conference of 1945. Exhaustive de-
bate at San Francisco in 1945 pro-
duced the decision that the organiza-
tion should not be based on univer-
sality of membership, but that there 
should be qualifications for member-
ship. In the Charter these are: 
a) Only peace-loving nations are 
eligible. It may be difficult to define 
and determine what is meant by a 
peace-loving nation, but it is not hard 
at any given time to determine what 
nations are breakers and disturbers 
of the peace. 
b) Only those nations are eligible 
for membership that are willing to 
assume and live up to the obligations 
of the Charter. 
This opened the way for the de-
feated nations in World War II to 
enter, if and when they qualified, and 
also for new states to enter. But the 
United Nations, unlike the League of 
Nations, has never expelled a mem-
ber, although a member [Indonesia] 
has voluntarily withdrawn. 
Now, what are the issues today? 
Communist China's record as to 
aggression. This is overwhelmingly 
relevant to the question of its ac-
cepting the "obligations of the Char-
ter." This is not just a matter of 
Korea. In February 1950, five months 
after the Chinese Communists estab-
lished their regime, it began its ag-
gressive course. This was predictable: 
Mao says every good thing comes out 
of the barrel of a gun. In February 
1950 the Chinese Communists issued 
a call to all people of Southeast Asia 
to overthrow their governments. Was 
this merely a move against colonial-
ism? No. It called for revolution 
against independent governments also. 
Then there came the Chinese Com-
munist 1950 Korean aggression and 
the United Nations resolution (still 
outstanding) which branded Com-
munist China as aggressor. The Chi-
nese Communist philosophy is: "Ours 
is a policy of fight-fight, stop-stop, 
half-fight, half-stop. This is no trick, 
but a normal thing." This is a phil-
osophy of alternating war and sub-
version. This was followed by direct 
Chinese Communist aggression in 
Southeast Asia (Laos and Thailand), 
Tibet, India, and indirect aggression 
in Vietnam. 
In view of this, in order to admit 
Communist China to the United Na-
tions, the United Nations Charter 
would have to be changed and the 
relevant qualifications for member-
ship removed. The Communist Chi-
nese know this and themselves say 
the Charter must be revised as a pre-
requisite for accepting a seat. 
Communist China's position re the 
United Nations is as follows: 
"All countries should review the 
United Nations Charter together." 
All "independent countries" should 
then be admitted and all "imperialist 
puppet states should be driven out." 
It wants to expel some members even 
before its own admission. Clearly the 
Chinese Communists neither want nor 
plan either universality or "coexist-
ence." 
They openly state what kinds of 
changes would have to take place in 
the United Nations: 
As a prerequisite to Communist 
China's accepting a seat, the United 
Nations would have openly to declare 
that the United Nations resolution 
condemning Communist China for 
aggression in the Korean War was 
"wrong," and brand the United States 
as the aggressor in Korea.

Another United Nations would 
have to be set up as a rival to the 
present United Nations. 
Thus, there is no more argument 
possible about what the necessary ef-
fect of the United Nations admission 
for Communist China would be: it 
would destroy the United Nations as 
we know it. The United States could 
not be a member under those condi-
tions and would have to withdraw. 
The current issue today is the war 
in Southeast Asia. 
The Communist Chinese show com-
plete obduracy here and hold to a 
hard line of demanding total United 
States-South Vietnam surrender. 
Can we change this by admitting 
Communist China to the United Na-
tions? On September 1, 1965 New 
China News Agency authorized broad-
cast stated: "The Vietnam question 
has nothing to do with the United 
Nations." 
Another current issue is the Tai-
wan issue. Communist China demands 
that we abandon a loyal ally, an ex-
cellent partner in economic, social and 
political development, and a strategic 
strength close up, by insisting that the 
United Nations throw the Republic 
of China out of that body as a pre-
requisite for its own entry. This would 
mean we would tell everyone else: 
"Go make your own settlement with 
Communist China; become its vas-
sal." Is there a way out of this in 
the so-called two-Chinas policy? No; 
this policy is utterly unfeasible, be-
cause the two main parties to it, Com-
munist China and the Republic of 
China, reject it totally and absolutely. 
The general issue today in regard 
to the western Pacific is: can we have 
any security if the whole area falls 
under control of such a hostile power 
as Communist China? No. We tried 
withdrawal between 1920 and 1941, 
but it just led to a greater war. 
Can we hope for change in Com-
munist China? It is often said that 
we can make the United Nations a 
reform school for Communist China. 
But, of course, the answer is that if 
the United Nations is made over on 
the Communist Chinese model, Com-
munist China won't have to change, 
will it? Since we can't change that 
much, we will have to get out if they 
come in on their terms. 
The overriding policy question is 
the growing United States-Communist 
China confrontation in Southeast Asia 
and what it may mean to Communist 
China: destruction at our hands. In 
view of this, it is natural that more 
interest in United States China policy 
should develop. The possibility is 
clear that this time another major 
United States-Communist China con-
frontation may destroy Communist 
China. 
Finally, Pope Paul VI has been 
widely quoted (October 4, 1965) as 
urging Communist China's United 
Nations admission by saying to the 
United Nations that it should "study 
United States Policy Toward China 
IN0 GREAT EXPANSIONIST movement 
has ever stopped until it was checked. 
Our choice?with Red China as it 
was with Japan and Hitler?is not 
between checking and not checking; 
it is whether to check early, while we 
can, and with allies?or try to check 
the aggression later when it is strong-
er, closer, and we have fewer and 
weaker friends and allies. 
The question is how to check it?
with least risk and cost. 
From what I have seen in the press, 
most of the proposed changes in 
American policy towards Communist 
China appear to be based on certain 
520 NATIONAL REVIEW 
assumptions which do not seem to me 
to be justified: 
?That the Communist regime now 
in control of the China mainland is 
here to stay. 
The same was said of Hitler, of 
Khrushchev, of Sukarno, of Nkrurnah. 
People are not so sure now of Castro. 
Despots generally appear invincible?
"until the last five minutes." 
?That the United States is stubborn-
ly keeping Red China isolated and 
therefore we are responsible for its 
hostility and belligerence. The reverse 
is the truth; it is Red China's hostility 
and belligerence in its international 
attitudes and actions, that are re-
the right method of uniting to your 
pact of brotherhood in honor and loy-
alty, those who do not yet share in 
it." But here is what L'Osservatore 
Romano, the official organ of the Vati-
can, said of this on October 18-19, 
1965. In an editorial under the title 
"The Church and the Universal Com-
munity of States," it takes note of the 
fact that there are people who have 
"given a precise political meaning" 
to those words of His Holiness. Then 
the editorial declared: "But true uni-
versality does not mean the arithmetic 
sum of nations; it presupposes the 
convergence of everybody on the ef-
fective recognition of and respect for 
natural law, which is the foundation 
of the United Nations." That is to 
say, the rule of law is primary; ex-
panding United Nations membership 
is secondary. 
The Pope is thus saying what we 
all know to be true, namely that any 
form of political association must be 
founded on some measure of agreed-
upon community of values, and that 
for such associations to tolerate as 
components thereof those elements 
which deny and forcefully flout the 
agreed-upon community of values, 
will seriously endanger and probably 
eventually destroy the association. 
Thus, limitations upon membership 
and upon participation in political ac-
tion are common to all political com-
munities. The United Nations, weak 
as it already is, is no exception. It 
cannot be an exception.

sponsible for its isolation.

getting Red China to change its atti-

on matters like diplomatic recogni-
tion, trade, and admission to the 
United Nations than by resolute con-

as long as Red China refuses to act 
like a responsible member of civil-
ized society.

sires and hopes for "evolution" in 
Red China. The debate should be over 
what measures are most likely to pro-
duce it: 
Giving Red China greater prestige, 
influence, entree, that is, making it 
stronger? Or keeping it as weak and 
isolated as possible? 
Concessions from its intended vic-
tims?like the United States? Or 
pressures from its present victims?
the Chinese within Red China, those 
on Taiwan and in Southeast Asia, 
Muslims in Indonesia and Malaysia, 
etc.? 
Proving that Red China's trucu-
lence and stubborn defiance of the 
world succeeds? Or showing that it 
will fail? 
Let us look now at the changes in 
policy toward Red China suggested 
by some. They are mostly three: 
official diplomatic recognition by the 
United States, expansion of trade re-
lations, and admission of Communist 
China to the United Nations. What 
would be the probable results of such 
changes, the gains and losses? 
Almost no one, so far as I have 
seen, goes further than expressing the 
vague hope that after these steps Red 
China may "mellow, moderate, ma-
ture, evolve." But there is no evi-
dence on which to base the hoped-
for gains. 
What benefits, economic or politi-
cal, has Great Britain received from 
her granting of diplomatic recognition 
in 1950? Or France two years ago? 
Prime Minister Nehru of India 
recognized Communist China in 1950 
and worked out with Chou En-lai the 
"Five Principles of Coexistence." He 
remarked that Americans didn't get 
along very well with the Chinese 
Communists because we are not 
Asians, implying that he, being a 
fellow Asian, could. He was Red 
China's chief apologist and advocate 
?at the UN and elsewhere. How did 
his fellow Asians in Peking respond 
to his being their best friend? They 
invaded India, and left Mr. Nehru a 
broken man. 
It is suggested that with diplomatic 
recognition we might get more infor-
mation about conditions in Red China. 
But we have been getting plenty of 
information by a variety of means, 
especially from the thousands of 
escapees each year. Red China has not 
allowed any newspaper correspondent 
of any nationality to travel freely in 
that land unless it had reason to be-
lieve in advance that he was general-
ly sympathetic. Our trouble is not 
lack of information but erosion of our 
steadfastness, our patience, our will?
as Mao boasted would be the case. 
In contrast, there is no uncertainty 
as to the losses that would result 
from the suggested weakening of 
American policy. Here are some: 
It would pull the rug out from under 
our loyal allies on Taiwan. The 
Chinese are a realistic, even fatalistic, 
people. With no hope for reunion in 
freedom with their brethren on the 
China mainland, they would have 
little or no choice but to prepare for 
the inevitable. Americans who advo-
cate admitting Red China and then 
add glibly, "Of course we would sup-
port the defense of Taiwan," may be 
salving their own consciences but 
think no Asians will be deceived. 
Twelve million Chinese could hardly 
maintain indefinitely the will or the 
capacity to resist 700 million, with the 
world organization for peace itself re-
jecting the twelve million and accept-
ing the 700 million! 
With weakening or loss of Taiwan 
our Pacific island chain of defenses 
would be breached. It is doubtful that 
the Philippines could long resist Com-
munist pressures and blandishments. 
Filipinos remember that it was from 
Taiwan that their country was in-
vaded by the Japanese. It would take 
vast intervention with American 
forces to save that new nation for 
which we certainly have a special re-
sponsibility in the Pacific. I have not 
found any responsible Filipino leaders 
who favor recognition of Communist 
China. 
The fifteen million or so Chinese 
living in Southeast Asia occupy key 
positions of power and influence in 
Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, Burma, 
Indonesia, the Philippines. The gov-
ernments of those countries could not 
refuse to recognize Communist China 
once we did. That would mean every 
Chinese embassy and consulate in 
Southeast Asia. and in the world for 
that matter, would become a protected 
center of Communist espionage, prop-
aganda, sabotage and subversion of 
the host government?as recently ex-
posed in Indonesia and Ghana. 
Through these "embassies and con-
sulates" the Chinese minorities would 
be under direct and almost irresistible 
pressure to support the aggressive 
policies of the Mao regime. 
The stability of the strategic coun-
tries of Southeast Asia would inevita-
bly be weakened. Can anyone reason-
ably expect the governments of these 
smaller and weaker countries to be 
stronger Sand firmer vis-a-vis Red 
China than the great United States 
is? 
If the United States were to show 
that it is not a dependable ally in 
Asia, our allies elsewhere, including 
those in Europe, would know they 
could not count on us either. What 
would happen to the whole system of 
collective security we have been 
building at such cost and effort and 
which is absolutely indispensable to 
our own survival as a free nation? 
Why should any country anywhere 
stand by us if it is not sure we will 
stand by it? 
It would tell the neutrals and "un-
committed" nations that they were 
right all along and that they might 
as well give in to the winning side 
at once. 
Perhaps worst of all, it would tell 
the 700 million people on the China 
mainland that we are accepting their 
subjugation, that we think there is 
more hope for peace for ourselves in 
deals with their oppressors than in 
standing steadfastly with them, the 
oppressed. 
During the war and postwar years 
the United States relaxed under the 
skilfully built-up illusions that the 
Soviet Union was a "peace-loving 
democracy," eager and willing to co-
operate to build a world of order and 
peace, and that the Chinese Commu-

nists were just agrarian reformers. 
Perhaps our best hope of getting out 
of our present predicament and peril 
without a nuclear holocaust lies in 
the urge-to-be-free that lives in the 
hearts of a billion human beings be-
hind the Communist curtains. Unless 
these people are able from within to 
force their Communist regimes to 
change and eventually abandon Com-
munist world objectives, there is little 
hope of our avoiding an ultimate all-
out clash. Is it intelligent or realistic 
to adopt a foreign policy that can 
cause those millions behind the Cur-
tains to abandon hope? If the strong 
accept the Communist overlords, how 
long can the weak continue to resist 
them? 
What would be the gains from re-
sumption of trade relations? The 
Communists themselves have made 
clear on numerous occasions that 
their unwavering purposes are: 
First, to get military and industrial 
equipment and supplies which they 
cannot yet obtain within the Com-
munist bloc?not in order that they 
can trade more with us in the future, 
but so they can become self-
sufficient and not need to trade with 
us at all. 
Second, to take advantage of a 
favorable trade situation wherever 
there is one that they cannot match 
even by exploitation of their own 
people and of their satellites. 
Third, to induce countries to be-
come more and more dependent on 
trade with the Soviet bloc, and there-
fore more and more at its mercy. 
This applies particularly to Germany 
and Japan. 
Fourth, to divide the free world 
powers. 
Communist Trade Monopolies 
All trade is conducted by Commu-
nist state organizations and monopo-
lies that have as their single objec-
tive the strengthening of the State. 
They cannot trade under the accepted 
rules of the free world without ceas-
ing to be Communist. They cannot 
cease to be Communist without their 
movement collapsing. Trade is as 
much a weapon of their expansionism 
as are missiles. It is to be expanded 
or contracted, to be directed here or 
shifted there, as those at the top de-
termine to be advantageous in pro-
moting the Communist world revolu-
tion. 
Where trade between Communist 
China and other countries exists, it is 
522 NATIONAL REVIEW 
only on sufferance of the Communist 
government and will be extinguished 
when it has served its purpose. This 
has never been denied by the Chinese 
Communist leaders. On the contrary, 
they have avowed on numerous oc-
casions that complete nationalization 
of industries and trade and collec-
tivization of agriculture has to come, 
but in stages?which means just as 
fast as they feel themselves strong 
enough to impose it. Would it be in 
our interest, economic or otherwise, 
to help them do it faster? 
The Head-in-Sand Line 
What would be the result of ad-
mitting Communist China to the 
United Nations? 
Admission would represent for Red 
China the greatest possible diplomatic 
victory. It would give the Mao regime 
the stamp of legitimacy and add im-
measurably to its prestige and power 
all over the world. Why has every 
Communist government, party, and 
front in the world worked tirelessly 
for fifteen years for Red China's ad-
mission if that would be bad for 
Communism and good for us? 
Some say, "But Communist China 
is a fact. We must be realistic. We 
cannot hide our heads in the sand 
and ignore it or pretend it is not 
there." But that is not a description 
of our policy. On the contrary, it is 
just because we recognize that Red 
China is indeed a fact, and such a 
powerful and dangerous fact, that 
intelligent concern for our own and 
the world's future requires its ex-
clusion from the United Nations until 
it is willing to meet the qualifications 
for membership. To admit it prior to 
that time would only make it more 
powerful and more dangerous. 
The Communist regime in China 
avowedly is dedicated to the isolation 
and destruction of the United States. 
Should America help it to a better 
position from which to work for that 
objective? 
It is an utter non-sequitur to say 
that because "Red China is there" it 
ought to be admitted to the UN. 
There are gangsters in some of our 
cities. We do not argue that there-
fore the city councils, courts and 
police force should take the gangsters 
in. Rather we demand that lawless 
elements be kept out of the forces 
responsible for maintaining law and 
order, or "peace and security"?which 
the UN Charter states is the purpose 
for which the organization was es-
tablished. 
To keep Red China isolated and 
weaker than it would otherwise be is 
not denying or ignoring its existence; 
it is the realistic way to deal with its 
existence. 
It is said that the United Nations 
ought to be a universal organization 
with all existing governments in it. 
But the Charter makes perfectly clear 
that the UN was never intended to 
be a universal organization. That con-
cept was discussed at San Francisco 
?and rejected. Why would the 
Charter have Article 6 providing for 
expelling "a member which has con-
sistently violated the principles con-
tained in the present Charter," if 
the organization was supposed to be 
universal? 
So it is grossly untrue that the 
United States is stubbornly, blindly, 
arbitrarily keeping Communist China 
out of the United Nations, as is some-
times claimed. Red China is stub-
bornly keeping itself out. It simply 
refuses to qualify. I don't know any 
university that will admit a student 
without his meeting its entrance re-
quirements?even if he has a gun. 
It is said that if the United Nations 
is not to admit Communist China, 
then it ought to expel the Soviet 
Union. This is a good logical argu-
ment, but it is a useless one. The 
Soviet Union can veto its own ex-
pulsion. 
Never Trouble Trouble 
The fact that there are already some 
bad actors in the UN is all the more 
reason why we should not, know-
ingly, bring any more in. 
It is suggested that if we recognize 
Communist China and admit it to 
the United Nations, it might improve 
the functioning of that and related 
international organizations. There is 
far more evidence that it would 
hamper their functioning. The only 
time the United Nations has been 
able to operate as it was intended to 
on a matter as serious as aggression 
was in 1950 when the Soviet Union 
was absenting itself from the Secu-
rity Council in an effort to pressure 
the United Nations into admission of 
Red China?and thus was unable to 
veto UN action against the Corn-

munist aggression in Korea. Moscow 
is not likely to make the mistake of 
being absent again. 
It is clear that Communist govern-
ments do not join the United Nations 
with the same purpose in mind as 
we and other governments do, name-
ly, to help make it an effective 
instrument for resolving disputes. 
Obviously the Soviet Union joined 
in order to make sure the UN does 
not work effectively. It has a world 
organization of its own, the Com-
munist Party, with organized, disci-
plined, efficient units in every coun-
try. The Communists intend to win 
for their world organization. What 
could be more advantageous than to 
have seats in the other world organi-
zation also, particularly in the Se-
curity Council, where perfectly le-
gally under the Charter, they can 
keep the rival organization crippled 
and ineffective whenever they wish 
to? Almost all of the more than 100 
Soviet vetoes have been against 
measures that were favored by the 
overwhelming majority of UN mem-
bers and were in the direction of 
peace. 
It is not necessary to have Red 
China in the UN in order to negotiate 
with her, on this or any other matter. 
We have had over 130 negotiations 
with it in the last eleven years?
almost one a month?and more than 
any other non-Communist govern-
ment has had. 
Then there is the old diversionary 
argument. "What about Chiang Kai-
shek?" Well, what about him? 
History will decide his proper place 
and I predict it will be a high one. 
But our policy is not and has not 
been based on Chiang; if he were 
gone tomorrow, America's interests 
would be precisely the same. We are 
trying to help free peoples remain 
free; therefore, it is to our interest 
to support all peoples who will make 
determined efforts in that direction. 
The Free Chinese on Taiwan certainly 
are making such efforts?and suc-
ceeding. They are ahead of every 
other country in Asia except Japan. 
We were able to stop our economic 
assistance to Free China last July. 
So if one examines the results of 
the proposed changes in American 
policy toward China, it is apparent 
that the benefits would be minimal, 
if any. The dangers to the countries 
still free in Asia, to the United 
Nations itself, and to our own secu-
rity and peace, would be certain and 
serious indeed. On the other hand, 
the policy of keeping Red China 
contained and isolated has proved 
successful in promoting the vital se-
curity interests of the United States. 
Men have always found ways of 
bringing down tyrants?and the Chi-
nese will bring down theirs?if only 
we are not beguiled into throwing 
the ball game away in the last quar-
ter by failing to stand fast?"five 
minutes longer." We are called upon 
by history to prove that free citizens 
have greater fortitude, stronger 
Communist China, Vietnam and 
United States Policy 
THE SINO-SOVIET CONFLICT has to be 
seen within the framework of Com-
munism, as a power struggle within 
the Communist world, and not as an 
expression of national interests by 
competing states of an international 
order of the past. 
In discussing today the problems 
our own policy faces with regard to 
Communist China, in Vietnam and in 
Asia in general, I believe it to be of 
foremost importance that we accept 
the fact that our opponent, or rather 
our opponents, are not national states 
or traditional powers with traditional 
ambitions, but components of that 
Communist movement that is out to 
conquer the world by whatever 
means and to transform it in its image. 
I believe that the most fatal mistake 
that we can make is to assume that 
Communism is dead, that a Commu-
nist ideology is dead, and that we 
deal with powers which pursue tradi-
tional national interests and have to 
be dealt with on that basis. Lately 
it has often been argued that the be-
havior of the Communist Chinese-
nerves and steadier patience and 
faith than do tyrants?faith in man 
and faith in God. 
In summary, seating of Red China 
in the United Nations would be 
illegal. It would require violation of 
the organization's Charter. 
It would be immoral. It would al-
most certainly mean removal of a 
member that abides by the Charter 
to seat a non-member that brazenly 
refuses to abide by the Charter. It 
would abandon 700 million people to 
Communist subjugation. It would 
properly be regarded as an attempt 
to buy peace for ourselves by sacri-
ficing our principles and other peo-
ples' freedom. 
And it would bring no practical 
benefits. On the contrary, there would 
be certain and disastrous losses?with 
our allies; with the neutrals; with the 
peoples in Asia and everywhere else 
who desire to retain their freedom; 
and with the long-suffering millions 
now under Communist rule who yearn 
to regain their freedom. Do not break 
the hearts of the oppressed and their 
continued will to resist from within 
by accepting their oppressors. 
Until someone can suggest policies 
that offer better prospects of success, 
based on something more substantial 
than speculation, wishful thinking or 
just hope, I can see no sound, sensi-
ble, or logical reason to change pres-
ent policies and every reason to con-
tinue them, always being flexible in 
our tactics as required by develop-
ments as they come along.

the world, we would then be able to

concept of rationality.

lectually, let alone politically, than 
that between the emperors of Con-
fucian China of old and the Commu-
nist Party's Marxist-Leninist China of 
today. The two are not even histori-
cally related. Between the period of 
the rule of the emperors of old and 
that of the Communists of today, 
China was under the National Gov-
ernment which accepted the Western 
concept of the nation-state. When the 
Communists took over in 1949 they 
did not abolish a Confucian imperial 
order but the law courts, the codes, 
the educational system, the Western 
economy and the Western thought 
that had been the basis of a Nation-
alist China that was well on the way 
to taking its place in the world until 
the Japanese attack in World War II, 
and the civil war that followed, de-
stroyed it. 
Communizing China 
The Communists, after their con-
quest of power, had two major pur-
poses: to communize China internal-
ly and to contribute to the world 
Communist revolution externally. It 
is the latter purpose which poses the 
problems we are facing today in Asia. 
Any attempt to ignore this Commu-
nist purpose is done at our risk. It 
is simply unrealistic to assume that 
by gestures or offers, by trade or dis-
cussions we will sway the Commu-
nists to accept our world of live and 
let live. They are realists, of course. 
who will not go into ventures they re-
gard as hopeless. They will move 
when they regard the time and the 
situation as opportune; and they will 
bide their time when, in their terms. 
the revolutionary wave has subsided. 
But we have to understand that their 
logic is not our logic. When we nego-
tiate, we have to remember that their 
purpose is not ?ours. And until the 
Communist purpose of world domi-
nation has changed, all that can be 
arranged is at best a truce. 
The hope has been expressed that 
what is sometimes called the "out-
moded doctrine of Marxism-Lenin-
ism" is losing its grip on Communist 
leadership, or that at least the next 
generation of leaders will no longer 
believe in world revolution. This can 
only be regarded as wishful thinking. 
There is no evidence whatsoever that 
the main tenets of the gospel itself 
have been affected in Communist 
524 NATIONAL REVIEW 
thinking by this or the younger gen-
eration, whatever shifting strategy 
may recommend itself to them at the 
time. 
But, of course, the strategies have 
been shifting. Karl Marx's original 
predictions of the increasing misery 
of the industrial proletariat have been 
completely disproved by develop-
ments in the industrial countries, and 
then the Bolshevik revolution oc-
curred in what was at best a marginal 
area of industrialization. The hopes 
which its leader, Lenin, placed on a 
Communist revolution in Germany in 
1919, 1920 and 1922, proved false. It 
was Lenin who then shifted to strat-
egy number two in the Communist 
grand plan for world conquest. His 
theory of Imperialism as the Highest 
Stage of Capitalism permitted the 
use for Communist purposes of re-
volutionary tensions in what we call 
today the developing countries of the 
world. The strategy for Communist 
conquest in China and today in Viet-
nam and elsewhere, was Lenin's. It 
is the strategy of what the Commun-
ists call "wars of national liberation." 
It feeds on two elements. One is 
agrarian discontent or what is called 
the agrarian revolution in these pre-
dominantly agricultural countries. 
The other is the emerging nationalism 
of a small, Western-educated elite, 
regarded by the Communists as 
bourgeois-capitalist or nationalist-
capitalist, but "anti-imperialist." The 
use of peasant discontent and of 
nationalist aspirations for Communist 
purposes must, however, not lead us 
astray. Mao Tse-tung, who followed 
this Leninist-Stalinist policy, was not 
an agrarian reformer nor was he a 
heretic. And Ho Chi Minh and the 
Vietcong today are Communists and 
not nationalists with Communist 
trimmings. 
The two strategies of proletarian 
revolution and of national liberation 
movements or wars of liberation are 
by no means irreconcilable. But the 
matter of coordinating them may pose 
problems. And the question of em-
phasis today, where there are two 
headquarters in the overall Com-
munist movement, has become a part 
of the expression of the conflict for 
power. Communist advance in the 
industrial world today is not possible 
through proletarian uprisings as once 
conceived after World War I, nor 
did the Communists prove able to 
exploit their participation in the re-
sistance movements during World 
War II in France and Italy for 
eventual take-over. And since there 
is now a universal fear of hydrogen 
war, blustering threat of same, as 
once used by a Soviet, has been ex-
cluded since it became clear that the 
United States would stand for Berlin 
or any part of Europe. So the strategy 
has shifted to what is called "peace-
ful coexistence." In Khrushchev's 
words: 
Peaceful coexistence does not imply 
conciliation between socialist and 
bourgeois ideologies . . . The peace-
ful coexistence of states with differ-
ent social systems presupposes an 
unremitting ideological, political, and 
economic struggle of the working peo-
ple inside the countries of the capital-
ist system, including armed struggle 
when they find that necessary [sic!] 
and the steady advance of the national 
liberation movement among the peo-
ples of the colonial and dependent 
countries. 
'Peaceful Coexistence' 
Their "peaceful co-existence" does 
not mean the end of confrontation 
with Communism, but it is confronta-
tion in an area where our superiority 
?once we understand the threat?
should not make us fear the battle, 
so much better to be fought in the 
intellectual rather than in the mili-
tary field. 
But it is different with the wars 
of liberation. This type of warfare, 
focused today in Vietnam, is the 
strategy that the Soviets have as 
much approved as the Chinese. If 
they are somewhat reluctant to go all 
out for it as the Chinese Communists 
do, it is in order not to compromise 
the peaceful co-existence strategy for 
which they want to be known. In 
my view, Ho Chi Minh has not only 
received Soviet support from the be-
ginning, but will be backed as long 
as the Soviets believe that this par-
ticular national liberation war looks 
favorable. The 'Chinese Communists, 
however, have gone all out for this 
strategy. Its priority in today's Com-
munist advance was openly stated 
by the Indonesian Communist leader 
D. N. Aidit, who lost his life recently 
in the 'Communist coup in Indonesia. 
It has become most memorably pro-
claimed in the often-quoted statement 
of the Chinese Communist military 
leader Lin Piao, who compared the

national liberation wars in the de-
veloping countries to the strategy 
once used in China by the encircle-
ment of the cities through Communist 
control of the rural areas in prepara-
tion for eventual take-over of the 
whole country. In the same way the 
rural areas of the world?the coun-
tries of Asia, Africa, and South 
America?are to be taken over first 
by the encirclement of the industrial 
nations now regarded as the cities 
of the world. The most important 
sentence is perhaps the one in which 
Lin Piao compared the effectiveness 
of the two strategies: 
Since World War II, the proletarian 
revolutionary movement has for vari-
ous reasons been temporarily held 
back in the North American and West 
European capitalist countries, while 
the people's revolutionary movement 
in Asia, Africa and Latin America has 
been growing vigorously. 
It is this Communist advance that 
we are facing today. Should it suc-
ceed in Vietnam it will continue else-
where; in Southeast Asia, the Middle 
East, Africa and South America. That, 
at least, is the Communist intent But 
things have not been going well for 
the Chinese Communists both in Asia 
and in Africa, and the ?Chinese set-
backs have, in my view, something to 
do with the proof of our willingness 
to resist in Vietnam. 
Since we are facing a Communist 
strategy and not Chinese nationalist 
imperialism, or for that matter, Soviet 
nationalist advance, such Communist 
insurgencies as in Vietnam have to be 
locally based. But a local insurgency 
is only possible as a part of the Com-
munist conspiracy, using the organ-
izational and ideological framework 
that is uniform for all Communism. 
On this basis the local Communists 
receive not only political support 
from the movement but also outside 
aid in the form of equipment, financ-
ing, military expertise and leadership 
and, where feasible, direct military 
support. Where they were left alone 
as in Malaya or in the Philippines, 
such Communist insurgencies could 
be defeated. The problem today is to 
defeat such an insurgency in Vietnam 
where it is receiving that outside 
support. 
We have today begun to under-
stand that this insurgency is not 
simply military action which requires 
a military answer. One of its most 
important ingredients and one that is 
not contained in Mao Tse-tung's 
homilies on guerrilla warfare is the 
use of terror. This terror is not the 
use of atrocities for atrocity's sake or 
as some have held, "the killing of 
some unpopular landlords or admin-
istrators." It is rather the systematic 
elimination of the leadership of the 
communities to be taken over by the 
Communists through assassinations 
of the most educated and most re-
spected local leaders: the local 
school teacher, the village head, the 
monk, and the families of these peo-
ple. It is also directed against all 
those who refuse to cooperate, who 
refuse to provide intelligence and 
service. Its aim is not only to in-
timidate the communities, to show 
on which side one can survive, it is 
also directed at depriving the com-
munities of their leadership so that 
the Communist cadres can take the 
place of those who have been killed. 
To fight this strategy requires 
more than simple military action. 
What is necessary, of course, is the 
ability to protect the population from 
this threat. Before this protection 
can be guaranteed, all the destruc-
tion of the guerrilla forces is at best 
a temporary reprieve. But there is 
much more at issue. 
The problem of the developing 
countries of Asia is the problem of 
a vast transformation. A revolution-
ary transformation indeed, which will 
take place and is taking place in 
these countries under whatever 
auspices. Under the impact of the 
modern world, its ideas and its 
economics, the traditional agrarian 
societies of this world of old agrarian 
civilizations are disintegrating. The 
Western-educated small elites are the 
first to have been affected by Western 
ideas, Western education and West-
ern forms of life. But the gap has 
widened between these Westernizing 
cities and the rural areas, mostly 
neglected and often contemptuously 
disregarded or exploited by the new-
ly emerging elites. It is this gap that 
the Communists have been exploit-
ing. What is needed, regardless of the 
Communist threat, is the re-integra-
tion of the societies and nations of 
the world of developing states, a 
revolution within their old tradition 
based on their own beliefs and ideas. 
This revolution does not consist 
simply of technical change. Modern 
hygiene, health measures, the fight 
against malaria, hospitals, schools, 
new agrarian methods, are only tech-
nical forms of changes. What matters 
is the cultural framework in which 
this transformation takes place, and 
"cultural" in this sense is more than 
the outward manifestations of a ma-
terial world. It has been said that 
Communism is strong because of its 
political organization. And the fight 
against Communism is truly an or-
ganizational battle. But the Commu-
nist organization is based on Commu-
nist ideology and Communist purposes. 
If there were no ideology there would 
be no Communist Party and no Com-
munist threat. The problem of the 
countries of the developing world is 
to integrate revolutionary changes 
into their cultural tradition. In the 
solution to this problem we can and 
should assist. To do so we need an 
understanding of the beliefs and 
ideas of the great Asian cultural 
traditions in order to comprehend the 
setting in which these changes will 
take place. A true nationalism in 
these countries?not the Communist 
exploitation of it?must be founded 
on these cultural traditions. 
We have to realize, for instance, 
that democratic elections which we 
rightly regard as the free expression 
of a people's will require a social 
framework that does not necessarily 
exist in the countries concerned. 
Without a viable organization in the 
communities there is a serious prob-
blem of political organization. Politi-
cal parties in our sense are a new 
development and need time and the 
foundation upon which to grow.

has today recognized the need of 
"capturing the revolution." The eco-
nomic, social and political reforms 
initiated in South Vietnam, the spe-
cial teams that are to compete with 
the National Liberation Front?our 
real enemy?lead us in the right 
direction. 
I would regard it as a deadly mis-
take to give administrative recog-
nition in negotiations?let alone be-
forehand?to the very foe who is 
aiming to destroy the society we are 
trying to build. Truly free elections, 
once they can be held, need not be 
feared. 
But Vietnam is not an isolated 
United States Relations with 
Communist China 
THE UNITED STATES is better informed 
about Communist China today than 
is any other country in the Free 
World. Our government provides 
daily translations of the mainland 
press and periodicals for general use, 
it translates for its own purposes a 
great variety of specialized Chinese 
printed material, some of which it 
puts at the disposal of scholars. There 
are about a dozen major universities 
with libraries and staff sufficient to 
provide the student with advanced 
graduate training on China. Courses 
in the Chinese language can be taken 
at hundreds of universities and col-
leges. The financial support provided 
by private foundations and by the 
National Defense Education Act has 
been instrumental in giving us hun-
dreds of scholars well trained in the 
Chinese language and one or more of 
the disciplines. Our library holdings 
on Communist China are very exten-
sive, and we publish more studies on 
Communist China than all other non-
Communist countries put together. 
The combined resources of England, 
France, and Germany, both human 
and material, are small indeed when 
compared with those of the United 
States. 
The American scholar, it has been 
pointed out, cannot go to Communist 
China and therefore loses a valuable 
asset. This is true; the Communists 
will not allow him in. There is no 
substitute for being in the land, but 
in some cases there is not a great 
advantage. Most of the correspondents 
of other countries who have resided 
in Peking are quite frank about the 
difficulties and frustrations facing the 
journalistic profession in that coun-
try. Hong Kong is a far more valu-
526 NATIONAL REVIEW 
able source of information about 
Communist China than is Peking. 
The main difficulty in getting in-
formation about China stems not 
from the fact that Americans are 
not allowed to visit there, but from 
the extraordinary efforts made by the 
Communist regime to prevent both 
its own people and other peoples 
from knowing those things it wishes 
to conceal. I would not be surprised if 
Peking found our economic studies to 
be more accurate than their own. I 
wish to mention this point about in-
formation because there are those 
who feel that we would be much 
better informed if we recognized 
Communist China and could send 
our scholars and journalists to that 
country. Unless there were a radical 
change in the attitude of the Com-
munist regime the evidence does not 
suggest that access to the mainland, 
considering the price we would have 
to pay, would make that much 
difference. 
The Soviet 'Model' 
I am not suggesting that we have 
sufficient information about Commu-
nist China, merely that we have as 
much if not more than anyone else. 
In the academic profession, while we 
all read the same materials, we do 
not arrive at the same conclusions. 
I find myself in general agreement 
with the descriptive material pre-
sented in this testimony?that Com-
munist China's domestic problems are 
serious and exacting, her military as 
well as economic resources are not 
those of a great power, her adven-
turous excursions in foreign policy 
have been costly and discouraging, 
issue. It is only the focal point in 
what I would regard as the present 
main front in the battle between 
Communist totalitarian aspirations 
and the support of our kind of revo-
lution, in a world that we want to 
keep free for the pluralism of cul-
tures and traditions, in Asia as well 
as elsewhere. 
GEORGE E. TAYLOR 
and that she is not getting along very 
well with the Soviet Union in either 
party or state relations. But I cannot 
follow some of the policy recom-
mendations of my colleagues because 
I think that they are based on de-
batable premises, and it is the 
premises that are crucial. 
Much is made of the assumption 
that we have stabilized our relations 
with the Soviet Union and that the 
same can be done with Communist 
China. The Soviet model is so taken 
for granted that it is never clearly 
defined. It is asserted that we now 
have a stable and tolerable relation-
ship with the Soviet Union and that 
this has come about through an evo-
lutionary process marked by changes 
within the Communist system. There 
certainly have been considerable 
changes and there is a sort of stability. 
But in my view the present stability 
is brittle in the extreme and is 
based mainly on the superior military 
power of the United States and its 
allies and on a common interest in 
avoiding one kind of war, nuclear 
conflict between the U.S. and the 
USSR. Moscow still favors subver-
sion and "just" wars of national 
liberation. The balance can change 
because it does not rest merely on a 
counting of nuclear bombs. There are 
other factors in the balance such as 
the state of the economy, the state 
of our alliances, the quality of our 
leadership. As we showed at the time 
of the Cuban crisis, a shift in the 
nuclear balance of power can be pre-
vented ?by the use of conventional 
weapons. Nor can we fail to note that 
the present stability includes a war 
with the Soviet Union by proxy in 
Vietnam, and Soviet cooperation with

Cuba in an effort to subvert Latin 
America, whose governments are so 
alarmed by Cuban activities that 
many have broken off diplomatic re-
lations with both Moscow and 
Havana. 
Two sets of reasons are usually 
given for the new Soviet behavior. 
There are those who think that the 
stability of our relations with the 
Soviet Union is due to changes in 
the mode of production which have 
been reflected in changes in the ideol-
ogical superstructure. They would 
phrase it differently but it is still 
vulgar Marxism. As the Communists 
put on fat, according to this theory, 
they acquire a democratic dislike for 
muscle. Such scholarly investigation 
as we have of this subject, to say 
nothing of the record, suggests that 
the question of whether or not there 
have been basic changes in the politi-
cal objectives of the Soviet Union is 
still open to serious question. Then 
there are those who think that pres-
ent Soviet behavior arises from the 
fact that we followed a policy of con-
tainment combined with recognition 
of the Soviet Union and its member-
ship in the UN. The same formula 
applied to China should produce the 
same results. It is proposed to con-
tinue the containment, offer recogni-
tion, and cease to block the way into 
the UN. This is a doubtful analogy 
on which to base action. Nor is there 
any real parallel between Communist 
China and the USSR, nor any surety 
that the same techniques will bring 
the same results. But the USSR could 
be used as an interesting case study 
of what happens when a Communist 
nation is treated with generosity and 
good will (as during World War II) 
and allowed to operate within an 
organization for the maintenance of 
peace. 
In my view it is safer to proceed 
on the premise that there is no world 
community, as the phrase goes, into 
which we can induce the Chinese to 
enter. Unfortunately we live in a 
world in which there are at least two 
violently opposed concepts of interna-
tional relations, of political and so-
cial organizations, and of world or-
der. The dialogue between them is 
still minimal. Everything we do with 
Communist China has to be seen in 
this context. Whatever the relations 
between Peking and Moscow, as far 
as the world community is concerned, 
they share the same outlook. The 
problem then is how to define our 
relations with the Chinese section of 
the Communist world. It is clearly 
necessary, in this dangerous world, to 
do this. 
Further to clarify my premises, I 
do not think, for example, that the 
evidence supports the fashionable 
view that the Communist world is 
falling apart and that Communist 
states have the same sort of foreign 
policy objectives as any other nation 
state or can be expected to pursue 
them in the same manner. The social 
and political content of nationalism is 
determined by the institutional power 
configuration and this is what is new 
and lasting about Communism. It is 
because it is the nature of power that 
determines foreign policy?to put the 
matter very briefly?that I feel there 
is little hope of any changes in Chi-
nese Communist policies that are not 
forced on her. It is necessary to men-
tion this because there is a great re-
luctance on the part of China spe-
cialists, perhaps because they love the 
Chinese so much, to admit that the 
Chinese Communists are really Com-
munists. 
The agrarian reformers of the for-
ties are now the aging paranoids of 
the sixties, to be handled, it would 
seem, by group therapy. If they were 
really nationalists masquerading as 
Communists, then Chinese tradition 
as well as the humiliations of nine-
teenth-century imperialism would be 
relevant to their mood, but in my 
view the Communists represent a 
complete break with the past. Their 
world view is not conditioned by the 
imperial past although they are will-
ing to exploit it. A comparison with 
some real nationalists will point up 
the differences. It was the National 
government that won the ending of 
imperial privileges in 1942 and lost 
the chance of building up a modern 
China largely as a result of the 
Japanese invasion. We might have 
difficulties with them if they were 
in power on the mainland, but I doubt 
they would be sponsoring the Viet-
cong or fomenting trouble in the rest 
of the world. There is nothing about 
Chinese nationalism that calls for the 
hate campaign of the Chinese Com-
munists against the United States, for 
the militarization of a quarter of the 
people of the earth, for the racial in-
vective that pervades so much of their 
propaganda, even in Hong Kong, or 
for the support of revolutionary 
movements in Southeast Asia, Africa, 
and Latin America as spelled out in 
the Central Committee decisions of 
1963 and reaffirmed in the Lin Piao 
statement. A true nationalism would 
call for attention to domestic prob-
lems and would certainly avoid a 
quarrel with a powerful neighbor. 
The most recent statement of Chi-
nese Communist political goals, the 
Lin Piao position paper of September 
1965, is variously interpreted. The 
Aesopian dialogue of the Communist 
world is not always easy to follow 
and this effort was clearly designed 
to achieve several purposes at the 
same time. In my view it should be 
taken seriously as a general indica-
tion of the objectives and strategy of 
the Peking wing of the movement. 
It is not impossible that this strategy 
could be made to work. It is based 
on the assumption that the revolution 
is not going to occur in the great in-
dustrial states, that the Achilles heel 
of the West is the Third World, that 
the promotion of wars of national lib-
eration in Africa, Latin America, and 
Southeast Asia will distract and waste 
the energies of the Western powers, 
confuse their peoples, and demoralize 
their leaders. 
Some believe that Communist China 
is too weak to carry out such a 
grandiose strategy, that in fact she is 
now reeling from shattering defeat. 
When the Soviets came to the as-
sistance of the Chinese Nationalists 
in 1923 they were not a strong power, 
but they almost succeeded in taking 
over the Nationalist movement at a

cost of 1,000 advisers and about $3 
million. The Chinese Communists 
were not very strong when they pro-
vided the Vietminh with the heavy 
weapons that made possible the con-
quest of Dien-Bien-Phu, nor when 
they intervened in North Korea, nor 
when they promoted a Communist at-
tempt to take over Malaya in 1948. 
May I also suggest that the Chinese 
Communists were involved in the at-
tempted coup d'etat in Indonesia last 
October and that it came very close 
to succeeding? If it had succeeded it 
would have been followed by an in-
tensification of the war against Ma-
laysia; Thailand would have been 
caught in a pincer, and our position 
in Vietnam would have become very 
precarious. 
The main question that the leaders 
and peoples of Southeast Asia are 
asking is, who is going to win? Under 
these conditions it would have seemed 
that the Chinese brand of Communism 
was in the ascendency; Lin Piao's 
statement would have looked like a 
curtain-raiser rather than noisy brag-
ging or defensive defiance. China is 
obviously in no position to seek a 
head-on collision with the United 
States and is most unlikely to give 
us the opportunity to declare war on 
her, but she is quite capable of fos-
tering wars of national liberation 
wherever opportunities are provided. 
It is said that we should not isolate 
Peking. It is Peking that is trying to 
isolate us. Communist China is far 
from being isolated; she has diplo-
matic relations of a sort with about 
forty countries and is trading with 
many she does not recognize, such as 
Japan and Canada. She is very much 
in the international community where 
it counts; in fact, much too much. 
The terms she has announced for tak-
Conclusion: Red China's 
Reaction 
The official Peking reaction to the 
Fulbright hearings was that they 
were in effect a venture in futility 
since the new proposals made by the 
members of the Red China Lobby 
were, nothing more than another ap-
proach by American Imperialists to 
frustrating the Chinese revolution. 
An article in the influential People's 
Daily of April 9, 1966, carries this 
commentary, in part: 
"The so-called China question has 
become the focus of attention in the 
U.S. in the past two months. U.S. 
scholars and idea men in the service 
of the ruling classes and responsible 
officials have put forth their views 
in a great debate on China policy.. . . 
"In reality, the 'containment with-
out isolation' formula is a manifesta-
tion of the U.S. imperialist counter-
revolutionary dual tactics on China 
policy. In short, this means on the one 
hand continued aggression against 
and encirclement of China, contain-
ment and isolation of China, while on 
the other, indulging in the vain hope 
to bring about 'peaceful evolution' in 
China so that revolutionary China 
will degenerate gradually. 
"It can be seen that the present de-
528 NATIONAL REVIEW 
bate reflects not the 'powerfulness' 
of the U.S. but its weakness and de-
feat and its helplessness and dilemma 
in face of the great Chinese people. 
Some influential Americans too criti-
cized the U.S. China policy as 'in a 
fundamental sense unsuccessful' and 
'long since out of date.' They called 
for a 'fundamental review of our 
China policy.' It is against such a 
background that the Johnson Admin-
istration wants to make use of the 
debate as a smokescreen to sidetrack 
the strong dissatisfaction at home and 
abroad with the U.S. anti-China pol-
icy and to cover up the continuance 
of the policy of hostility and aggres-
sion against China. 
"The debate shows that the differ-
ence between these idea men is about 
what counter-revolutionary method 
should be adopted. They are at one 
in persisting in the policy of hostility 
and aggression towards China. That 
is why none of them could put forth 
a feasible formula. After repeated 
deliberations and consideration, the 
experts ended in agreeing to the con-
tinuation and stepping up of the 'con-
tainment' policy. 
"Helpless and hopelessly, Harvard 
ing a seat in the UN are so out-
rageous that they must have been de-
signed to show her contempt for that 
organization. Her terms for accepting 
recognition are humiliating in the ex-
treme, although she would be de-
lighted to have us help her finish off 
the civil war by reducing or eliminat-
ing the international status of the Na-
tionalist government. If the Chinese 
Communists really want to live in 
peace with the world they are quite 
capable of making a move in that 
direction. 
In the meantime, it should not be 
beyond the wit of man to devise ways 
and means of putting the burden of 
proof, as far as peaceful intentions 
are concerned, on the Peking regime, 
so long as nothing is done to damage 
American credit in Asia and her 
willingness to stand by her friends 
and her principles. 
Professor John K. Fairbank, the so-
called veteran 'Chiang specialist,' and 
others, again put forward the long 
discredited 'two-Chinas' formula. 
Some others proposed that 'uncondi-
tional discussions' be held and 'diplo-
matic relations' established with 
China before the future of Taiwan 
is discussed. But even Dean Rusk 
himself had to admit that as far as 
the 'two Chinas' proposal was con-
cerned, 'it was useless' because China 
had rejected it. 
"U.S. imperialism's persistent hos-
tility towards the Chinese people is 
determined by its reactionary and ag-
gressive nature. There is nothing 
strange about it. What is strange is 
that U.S. imperialism even hopes to 
find a 'way out' of the blind alley of 
its China policy. The great debate 
in the United States over Washing-
ton's China policy shows once again 
that it is mere illusion. 
"Look, how many politicians, 
'scholars' and 'specialists' took part 
in these discussions. But nothing 
fruitful has come out of them. Nor 
will there be any result if more dis-
cussions are held. Gentlemen in 
Washington, there is nothing you can 
do about it!"
