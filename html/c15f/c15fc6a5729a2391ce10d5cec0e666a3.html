 SECTION 1 (SOVIET)
 "A" USSR, S0v?zet Threats of Withdrawal.   o  th  UN  Clarification has been
 received, of an unusual statement made; by Soviet propagandist Oleshchuk
 w uich was incorrectly reported as threatening Soviet withdrawal from the

 World Council of Peace,, (See OCI Daily Digests 7 & 12 Mar 51). Oleah-

 World Peace Movement as a reaction to Western activities in the UN., that
 the UNbut that withdrawal was almost inevitable unless there wai'- a drastic

 Santiago reports that the Soviet performance in the Economic and Social
 Council to date has had the effect of pointing up Moscow's chronic efforts
 to hamstring the UN,. The local consensus is that the USSR forfeited a
 :propaganda opportunity by its obstructive tactics. Public interest in the
 sessions  is now confined to key topics like forced labor, (C Santiago
 4S915 Mar 53.).
 "B" F,A TERRY  UROPE. Awe Former Cabinet Members Active in Political Work.
 Both former Minister a of Industry,, Rita Harder,,, and former Deputy Premlerj,
 Sp'ro Pano, who were released from their positions "to carry on more
 important duties" at the meeting of the presidium of the Albanian People's
 Assembly on 5 March, have recently made public statements. Marko extended
 the greetings of the Central Committee of the Albanian Workers' Party

 (Communist) at the March 8th celebration of International Women's Day,
 and Pano wrote an article in Zeni I 'o   1:ij criticizing local Communist
 officials for prohibiting criticism of old.membe?s in local Party cadres
 by the newer members? (U FBID, 12 Mar 51; U FBIS, 9 Mar 51), C       : The
 public statements made recently by both men suggests that they have not
 been purged. Their release from Cabinet posts probably has no connection
 with the dismissal of Minister of Justice, Dr, Manol Konomi,
 "C"    CZECHOSLOVAKIA. No Public Trial for Archbishop Beran. According to press
 reports from Praha, Archbishop Beran, Catholic Primate of Czechoslovakia
 who was banished from his see on 10 March, will not be tried for his so-
 called "negative attitude to the Peoples' Democratic Republic." An article
 in the newspapers j1dove Novin , denied foreign radio broadcasts to the
 effect that Beran was under arrest and awaiting trial. (U NYT, 16 Mar 5;.).
 01=-. These statements indicate that Beran will not be given a public
 trial,, It is likely, however, that Beran has already been tried in secret,
 which has resulted in his fine and banishment. The reaction of the press
 to foreign comment on the Archbishop's case indicates the sensitivity of
 the Communist regime towards reactions of Czechoslovakia's three-fourths
 Catholic population, It also provides indirect evidence of the effective-
 ness of VOA, BBC, and other western radio broadcasts in reaching and
 influencing the Czechoslovak public.
 "B"        Forei-an Trade Minister Reports on New Trade    eement with tthe USSR.
 Antonin Gregor, Czechoslovak Minister of Foreign-Trade, announced on his
 return from Moscow that a commercial agreement affecting the exchange of
 goods between his country and the USSR for 1951 had been signed. in the
 Soviet capital on 13 March 1951. In return for raw materials, machinery,
 grain, fodder, and food products, Czechoslovakia has agreed-to export to
 the USSR heavy machinery, metal-industry products, textiles, chemical
 goods, and a long list of other items, Gregor assured the Czechoslovak
 people that over and above the 600,000 tons of wheat the Soviet Union had
 promised to deliver during 1951, Czechoslovakia would receive a supplementary
 shipment of 155,000 tons before the end of May. He warned, however, that
 the increased shipments would cause transportation difficulties and that,
 therefore,, the rationing of bread and grain would have to continue. The
 Communist Foreign Trade Minister boasted that the USSR would deliver goods
 to Czechoslovakia at prices far below the. world level and would, in return,
 purchase Czechoslovak exports at prices much higher than the capitalist
 world would have been willing. to offer. (R FBIS, 16 Mar 51). CO::
 Gregor's remarks contain the expected eulogies of the Soviet Union and
 are sufficiently sycophantic to raise serious doubts regarding their
 accuracy. The decision to increase Soviet economic demands on Czechoslovakia
 subsequent to the conclusion of the 1.951 agreement in November 1950 and the
 current widespread purge of suspected nationalists from the Party and the
 Government are undoubtedly related phenomena. The significantly elevated
 Five-Year Plan targets promulgated by State Planning Chairman Dolansky
 probably have been designed in an attempt to statify the voracious Soviet
 maw,

 "C"   POLAND.    ual The Fai,  at Pow Canceled fob; 1951. Ludwig Grosfeld,
 President of the Polish Chamber. of Commerce confirmed in a recent conver-
 sation that the annual international trade fair in Poznan would not be held
 this year. In recent years the fair has become more a propaganda. effort and
 less an actual trade fair. Grosfeld attributed the Government's decision
 to the small foreign participation last year. The US Emb suggests that the
 decision to abandon the fair may be taken as another indication of the move-
 ment of Polish commerce and industry away from traditional trade relationships.
 this does not mean the E nb feels that Poland has abandoned its desire to
 trade with the West? Rather, Poland's intentions seem definitely to be to
 continue trade, serving Poland's interests, with the West. (R Warsaw Des 147,
 27 Feb 51).

 arriving from Bulgaria''tell-about the building of new highways leading toward
 the frontier, the bringing up of military units..." On the same date, 15 Mart
 Radio Moscow in Serbo-Croat stated: "They (the Yugoslavs) feverishly build
 strategic roads along the Bulgarian frontier and concentrate their troops
 on the same border." (R FBIB, 16 Mar 51). COt Before they call I will

 SECTION 2 (EASTERN)
 "A"  INDIA.  Third Shipment of Chinese Rice to Arrive in India.  According to
 the Ceylon radio, a ship carrying 9,200 tons of Chinese rice was to arrive
 in Madras, India, on 16 March.       Two earlier shiploads of Chinese rice
 totalling 13,100 tons had arrived in Calcutta on 19 and 27 February.  China
 has contracted to deliver 50,000 tons of rice to India in return for 16,500
 bales of jute bags.  (R FBIS, Far East, 16 Mar 5l).  COMMENT:  Arrival of
 the first shipload of Chinese rice was celebrated with appropriate ceremonies.
 Meanwhile, plans to ship 2,000,000 tons of US wheat to India are bogged down
 awaiting Congressional action.
 "B"  SYRIA.  Al-Azm Asked to Form the Government.  According to the Damascus
 radio, President Atassi has asked former Premier Khalid Bey al-Azm to head
 the government in view of they insistence of Prime Pi.nister Qudsi and his
 colleagues that their resignations be accepted.  (See 0CI Daily Digest,
 12 Mar 51).  In another report, several hours previous to the Damascus
 broadcast, US Ambassador Cannon stated that a communique issued by Qudsi's
 Populist Party indicated that the Populists would refrain from forming or
 participating in any new cabinet but would give their support to any
 cabinet consisting of parliamentary deputies.  This statement seemingly
 rules out Populist support for al-Azm, who is not a deputy.   (R FBIS,
 Western Europe and Near East, 16 Mar 519 C Damascus 463, 15 Mar 51).
 COMMENT:  Rumors have been circulating for the past week concerning the
 possibility that al=Azm would be asked to head the government if Qudsi
 insists on resigning.  The equivocal communique of the Populist Party and
 the interference of the army in governmental matters raise some doubt as
 to whether al-Azm, a fairly strong independent, either would desire or be
 able to form a cabinet of more then short duration.  However, in a similar
 difficult crisis (December 1949), al-Azm achieved success where Qudsi
 failed.  Al-Azm's strong ambition and practical realism in regard to the
 army's current power in Syria might again favor him. While al-Azm would be
 acceptable as Premier from a Western viewpoint, his success in forming a
 cabinet would not alter the essential instability of a government upon
 which the army exercises an undue amount of influence.
 "A"  INDOCHINA.  De Lattre's Demand for Reinforcements May Not Be Met.  French
 Defense Minister Moch is reported to have told General De Lattre, who is
 now in Paris, that De Laura's request for 12,000 "specialized soldiers"
 for his farces in Indochina would prevent France from fulfilling its
 European commitments.  De Lattre is said to have expressed. the view that
 his demands are "modest" and that for the first time since 1946 it was
 possible to foresee victory in Indochina.  (U NYTimes, 17 Mar 51).
 COMIVIENT:  General De Lattre has previously informed US officials in Indochina
 that he will resign his post if his request for reinforcements is not ful-
 filled by the French Government.

 "A"   B.  Chinese Communist Intervention.
 Navy Seng, the Kachin rebel leader, an        o    ers
 have completed their 'raining under Communist direction in Yunnan and, having
 been fully equipped, are now awaiting orders to infiltrate north Burma.  In
 addition, 600 Burmese who are also undergoing training in Yunnan are expected
 to be ready for operations in Burma by mid-April.                       Chu
 Chia-pi, the successful Communist guerrilla leader In Yunnan,  as been ap?
 pointed Chief of Staff. of the 14th Army and assigned the responsibility of
 directing Communist guerrilla activities in north Burma.
 two Chinese Communist Divisions recently arrived in Paos en  no
 far from the Burma border on the Burma Road) but that Chinese moves in Burma
 beyond their present program of training and supplying materiel will depend
 upon developments in Indochina -                  direct Chinese intervention
 in that country.  The Embassy comments t a    u is ideally suited for his
 reported assignment, that it appears that the Chinese are now ready to
 actively support the Burmese Communist insurrection, and that the method
 of intervention will be most difficult for the Burmese Government to resist.
 (S Rangoon 632, 16 Mar 51).  COMMENT:  Naw Seng enjoys considerable influence
 in north Burma and if provided with proper equipment and a safe haven in
 China, he could create widespread havoc as well as gain nevr recruits.
 Burmese forces are fully occupied with insurgents in lower Burma and cannot
 spare adequate troops to prevent widespread incursions into Burma from China.
 Furthermore, Chinese aid to the Burmese Communists rill instil new spirit
 into the latter's badly lagging insurrection and develop it as a serious
 threat to the Burmese Government.
 "C"  AUSTRALIA.  Parliament to Be Dissolved.  The Governor-General has agreed to
 Prime Minister Menzies' request that both houses of Parliament be dissolved
 and will issue a proclamation to that effect on 19 March.  The general
 election will be held on 28 April.  (U FBIS Wire, Melbourne, 17 Mar 51).
 COMMENT:  An opposition-controlled Senate has consistently stalemated
 Government legislation since the election of the Liberal-Country coalition
 in December 1949.  Since the entire Senate membership retires upon a
 Parliamentary dissolution (ordinarily Senate elections are staggered),
 the Government hopes to obtain a clear majority in both houses as a result
 of the new elections.  Although the popular vote will be extremely close,
 it is currently believed that the Government can eke out a victory.
 "C"          Conscription Bill Passed.  The Senate on 15 March passed the National
 Service Bill providing limited conscription for military service.  (U FBIS
 16 Mar 51).  COMMENT: The National Service Act establishes a
 lve-ye   military service plan.  It provide:. for compulsory registration
 of 18 year-olds for approximately six months training during the first year
 of service and for shorter periods during the following four years.

 "A"  CHINA.  Policy Tcwtvd Indochina.                                         the
 following indicat7 ons of a possible change in Peiping's policy toward
 Indochina:  (1) orders from Peiping to Canton that the "volunteer" corps
 for Inaoihina not be assembled for training; (2) dispatch to North China
 of five aattalions previously scheduled for "volunteer" service in
 Indochina; (3) statement of a Chinese Communist official that all such
 "vol.untr.er" forces might be sent north; and (4) (-iversion to Hankow of
 25X1A    large ammunition stocks originally consigned to Indochina.                        25X1A
 or a rumor  y now rumors.  The existence of a "volunteer" program has been
 reported but has never been reliably confirmed.  It is possible, however,
 that such a program was contemplated and that, in view of the course of
 the Korean conflict, it has been suspended.

 of a non-aggression pact.                         Peiping replied with demands
 that India demonstrate its sincerity, assure non-cooperation with the US,
 and submit details of its border claims.                                                25X1A
 COMMENT:  In early February, a New Delhi spokesman denied the rumor thy,
 a Sino-Indian non-aggression pact was under consideration, and in late
 February Peiping assured the GOI that Communist China subscribes to the
 Indian demarcation of the boundaries.  Nehru's neutral position in the
 East-West conflict is well established, and he is believed to be unlikely
 to conclude a non-aggression pact with a major nation of the Soviet bloc.

 member of the Secretariat of the CCP Politburo, will fill JEN's position
 on the Secretariat.  Current members of the Secretariat are MAO Tse-tung,
 CHU Teh, CHOU En-lai and. LIU Shao-eh'i.  If this surmise is correct, P'ENG,
 who was recently "elected" Mayor of Peiping, will have been elevated to
 the Secretariat over two other alternates, KAO Kang and CH'EN Yun.
 "B"  KOREA.  Attitude..of the ROE.  The ROK Defense Minister is reported to have
 stated on 15 March that UN forces had the duty of driving north to the Yalu
 River.  He warned that "victory at the 38th Parallel" would mean failure in
 that the Communists could again attack southward at any time.  (R FBIS,
 16 Mar 51).  COMMENT:  Although the predominant interest of the ROK in
 gaining control over North Korea 1a understandable, the ROK government is
 probably irritating its UN supporters by continually harping on the subject
 of unification.

 "C"          Seoul RecLptured.  The recapture of Korea's capital city, Seoul,
 has done much to rais- 'iorale in. the ROK.  The ROK government, however,
 is aware of the extent of destruction in Seoul and has requested refugees
 from the city to remain where they are behind UN lines until notified to
 return to Seoul.  Various governmental agencies have dispatched investi-
 gative and relief groups to the Seoul area and some mention has been made
 of the imminent return of the government to the former capital.  (R FBIS,

 "C"   JAPAN.  Foreign Office Studying US Troop Arrangements.  The-Japanese
 Foreign Office is studying the problem of resolving the differ?'ces be-
 tween US military regulations and eapanese civil law in anticipation of
 US troops being stationed in Japan after a peace treaty.  The Japanese
 Government is anxious to devise an arrangement under which US troops in
 Japan will have the maximum effective freedom of movement in the interests
 of Japan's security while at the same time avoiding the'precedent of
 granting extra-territorial rights to foreign troops.  (R FBIS, PANA,
 15 Mar 51).  COMMENT:  The Japanese, after more than five years of Occu-
 pation, are particularly sensitive on this subject.                       Any infringement of
 Japan's sovereignty by post-treaty US troops could well lead to a recru-
 descence of anti-foreign (especially anti-US) sentiment.
 "B"          Communist Party to Be Banned.  Well-informed sources in Tokyo insist
 that the Japanese Government has reached a decision to outlaw the Japanese
 Communist Party, and will present legislation to that effect to the Diet
 in May.  (U NYTimes, 17 Mar 51).  COMMENT:  Such action has been under con-
 sideration for the past two years.  Although no official confirmation has
 been received, it is possible that recent leftist Korean activities in
 Japan and the discovery of Korean espionage rings may have provoked a
 definite decision.

 11 "C"  'GERMANY.  East German Traffic Harassing Continues.  A further demon-
 stration o                        east Germans against t3S Firilns -running between western
 Germany and Berlin took place on 12 March in Magdeburg.  This incident,
 the fourth in the last two weeks, involved a group of approximately
 75 east Germans who paraded on the platform singing "Ami Go Homer' and
 pasted anti-American posters on the. side of the train.  One US Military
 Policeman was struck in the face with a small book as he was leaning
 out of the window of the train.  Ten to fifteen Russian soldiers were
 present, but made no attempt to restrain the Germans.  (R State, Berlin

 In a speec  before tbe-National Council of the Gaullist Rally of
 FRANCE.  Tightening of Party Reins Reduces Gaullist Electoral, Prospects.
 French People (RPF) 11 March, General de Gaulle ruled against electoral
 affiliation of non-RPF candidates with his party,,, and thus seemingly
 abandoned his former appeal for support from all non-Communists.  This
 ruling seems to be an attempt to bring into line those "political
 bigamists" who need Gaullist votes for election (C Paris 5334, 13 Mar 51).
 COMMENT.  De Gaullets realization that the electoral reform measures
 envisaged by the Government coalition are aimed at limiting the RPF's
 as well as the Communists' strength in the coming election is forcing
 him to work for rigid party organization at the expense of a wider
 field of influence.  The RPF can still be expected, however, to obtain
 roughly 100 seats:and become a major party in the next assembly.

 the Austrian Communist Party has made plans for a
 march on Vienna and a demonstration during the Easter holidays.  The
 party anticipates the participation of 50,000 Communist youths.  The
 the demonstration will be the culmination of a
 propaganda c mp     demanding a 15%' increase in salaries and that
 political circles in Vienna believe the Communists will attempt to
 provoke the fall of the Government as a result of the march,
 COR JICNT:  Except for reference to e
 downfall of the Government, t is report is virtually identical with
 those concerning a Communist demonstration planned for Whitsuntide
 (in May).  There have been no other reports indicating that a youth
 march was planned for Easter, but it is possible that the Communists,
 during the next week, may attempt to provoke large-scale strikes in
 conjunction with such a march.  In this manner, a larger demonstration
 could probably be effected, accompanied by sporadic violence.  There
 is little likelihood, however, that the Communists, either at Easter
 or 'Whitsuntide, could provoke the downfall of the Government.
 UNITED KINGDOM.  Government will Try to Step U  Colonial Recruiting.
 T` e House of Commons  as passed a Conserve 1ve   is private mot on
 calling on the Government to tap the maipower resources of the colonies
 by raising more colonial and native troops.  The Government reportedly
 accepted this in good part and promised further efforts in this
 direction, but stated that there are various practical difficulties.
 (U New York Times., 17 Mar 51).  COM  NT:  The Government has been
 becom3.ng   Creas:Lngly concerned a ou    a problem of raising more
 troops (See OCI Daily Digest, 13 Mar 51), and doubtless welcomes wide
 parliamentary support in the effort to utilize colonial manpower.
 The main source of such manpower is the African colonies and the
 practical difficulties center largely on the low level of education
 among the natives and the shortage of British junior and noncommissioned
 officers possessing the type of training and experience necessary.
 There will also be difficulty in getting the colonial territories to
 shoulder some of the added financial burden. Any rapid Oxpansion of
 remove the "Cape Colored" (i.e. mixed breed) voters from the common
 electoral roll, allowing them to vote only for their own separate
 representatives.  The Opposition immediately raised the constitutional
 point that this right is protected in one of the "entrenched clauses"
 of the South Africa Act (passed by the British Parliament in 1910 as
 the basic law of the Union) and hence could be altered only by a two-
 thirds majority of both House and Senate sitting jointly.  The Govern-
 ment, in its reply, argue', that the "coloreds'" voting rights will still
 in ro uce  intotlii_ House o   ssembly its key controversial oisl TO
 colonial forces is therefore not to be expected.

 be preserved and thA.t in any case the Statute of Westminster in 1931
 made the Union fully sovereign with the right to decide all.. matters
 of procedure.  The Speaker is expected to give his ruling on this
 point after the Houses Easter recess.  (U London Times, 8, 9, and
 12 Mar 51).  COMDENT:  The Speaker will prosru5 n favor of the
 Goverment whit ., though unable to muster a two-thirds majority of
 both houses, can easily pass the bill by a simple majority.  The Op-
 position will then be weakened in future elections by the loss of
 "colored" votes in a number of critical constituencies, and the way
 will be paved immediately for other racially restrictive measures on
 the Governmentss legislative program.  The constitutional issue also
 aroused some alarm among English-speaking white, South Africans because
 their right to equal political and cultural status with the more
 numerous Afrikaans-speaking population is similarly guaranteed by
 "entrenched clause's, and. the Malan Government contains elements who
 openly profess a desire to make the Union an Afrikaner republic.
 "B"   UNITED KINGDOM.  'Oil Company Makes Counter" Offe-ito Iran.  The Anglo-
 ran~.an                           r?mpan~`y  A_IOe   as  orma y o  ere 'NCO .discuss with Iran
 the creation of a separate oil. company in Iran with 50% of the profits
 accruing to Iran, and further offered to pay for the current year the
 higher royalty rates provided under a still unratified agreement sup-
 plementing its present contract.  Both offers are contingent on as-
 surances that the company~s concession will be continued.  The British
 note, in which these offers are made, stresses the legal right of AIOC
 to operate in Iran until 1993, points out that any disputes over the
 terms of the concession should properly be referred to arbitration,
 and suggests that Iran should draw a distinction between nationalization
 and expropriation.  (5 London 4934, 11 Mar 51, U New York Times, 17 Mar 51).
 COMMENT:  This note, sent to the Iranian Governmen  on    M     in an
 elroFE"to prevent passage of the nationalization. recommendations, failed
 .in its immediate purpose.  However, its implication that if Iran would
 agree not to expropriate the company's holdings some agreement might
 be worked out, could form a basis for further discussion.  The 50-50
 profit sharing offer, although known to the late Prime Minister Razmara,
 has become public knowledge for the first time.  In addition, there
 has been no definition of what the Iranians mean by "nationalizations.
 Although the high pitch of national feeling must. be kept in mind, it.
 is conceivable that extensive bargaining might end with AIOC being
 permitted to continue its operations under some formula more agreeable
 to Iran than the present arrangements.,

 "C"    BELGIUM.  Attitude toward Proposed Schuman Plan Organization
 se  In              asst' o  ici s in  ranee  ,e  isturle& y Belgian
 oreign    nister Van Zeeland's dissatisfaction over the proposed
 Schuman Plan organization.   (See OCI Daily Digest, S/S Supplement,
 15 Mar 51 for comments by Van Zeeland).  It is If It that the risks
 resulting from Van Zeeland's attitude are that    (1) the Belgians
 may try to initial the draft treaty -with reservations-an eventual-
 ity which probably would not be acceptable to the other participat-
 ing parties; and (2) when the Foreign Minister ; ::vet shortly to sign
 the coal-steel pool treaty, Van Zeeland may 'tm.y to open new questions
 on the grounds that the conference delegates could not commit their
 Governments.  (S S/S Paris 51399 15 Mar 51).  COMMENT:  Although the
 Belgians never accepted the Schuman Plan princip e enthusiastically,
 it is unlikely that, at this late date, they will impede efforts to
 initial the agreement.  Furthermore, Belgian ratification of the
 Schuman Plan Treaty probably mill be forthcoming without too much
 domestic opposition.
 "B"   FRANCE.  Exclusion from Malta Conference Irks French. Foreign Office
 o  'dale  ave emphatical   pro es ed US an   I Failure to invite
 France to participate in the talks regarding the defense of the
 eastern Mediterranean which opened at Malta on 12 Mar.  The French
 stand is based partly on fears of the repercussions which absence
 from the Malta talks-will have on North Africa.  (S S/S Paris 5136,
 15 Mar 51).   CC  ENT:  The French po .;; tion is that any defense prob-
 lem in any sec  r of the Mediterranean should be discussed by all
 three powers, and the Foreign Office considers participation by the
 three powers in the declaration on the Near East of May 1950 a
 precedent.  Because of the strong reaction in Moslem states to
 recent developments in French Morocco, France fears that its exclu-
 sion from such high-level discussions will produce an unfavorable
 impression on the Arab governments.

 reminded Embassy Paris that under the French constitution the Presi-
 dent may act only with the approval of a minister and that his per-
 sonal views do not commit the Govern ntt..  As Auriol is a voluble
 conversationalist and holds strong personal views on various inter-
 national subjects, he may express himself extensively in private
 conversations, and these opinions should not be taken as official
 unless they coincide with the Government line. (S S/S Paris 5435,
 15 Mar 51).
 "BW   UNITED KINGDOM.  Public Criticism of US Continues.  US Embassy London
 es t i r m a t e s       3 r ~ ?   s h pu  ` c at i u es  `r   . he US remain t"tindery",
 despite some decline in the intensity of adverse criticism of the US.
 The Embassy- further points out that although there is no doubt con-
 cerning fundamental Anglo-US agreement on basin, international issues
 and the Government deprecates this criticism's effect on -Anglo US
 relations, these public attitudes have been sufficiently strong to
 affect the shading and emphasis on some government policies.
 Particular issues likely to arouse public opinion are noted as
 Taiwan, crossing the 38th parallel in Korea, sanctions against China,
 German rearmament, Spain,, and further command appointments under NATO.
 The Ilnbassy also finds a growing public interest in international
 questions and attributes this partly to the recent intensification of
 domestic partisan political warfare vahich tends to magnify minor dis-
 putes.  (S S/S London It928, 1)4 Mar 51).  COMMENT.- British public
 opinion has been. unusually sensitive to US po ? cies and views during
 the whole postwar period, as the US has assumed leadership of the
 Western world and the UK has lost its former pre-eminence in inter-
 national affairs,  Above all, the British fear US inexperience and
 impulsiveness in the handling of foreign affairs and an alleged ten
 dency to substitute aggressive bullying tactics for subtle negotiations.
 The current international arms race and the threat of a new world war
 being precipitated. by events in the Far East have magnified this fear
 recently, vhile emphasizing Britain?s strategic vulnerability and
 relative weakness   These currents of opinion are not strong enough
 to disrupt the close Anglo-US partnership but they can reduce its
 effectiveness considerably if disregarded.
