 I South Vietnam:   Sporadic clashes continue on
 the northern and southwestern approaches to Saigon,
 and the city received a heavy rocket barrage again
 last night.
 Activity has picked up in the delta province
 of Dinh Tuong, where US troops in the past two days
 killed 200 Viet Cong.   Engagements in the Hue - Phu
 Bai area have turned up significant stockpiles of
 rice from the current harvest as well as weapons.
 In addition, intensive psychological warfare, sug-
 gested by three captured North Vietnamese prisoners
 induced another 80 to surrender.
 In the highlands allied ground operations and
 air attacks are apparently delaying a major enemy
 offensive.
 President Thieu has returned the general mo-
 bilization bill to the National Assembly with a re-
 quest for amendments to extend the upper and lower
 age limits for draftees, eliminate certain exemp-
 tions for veterans, and increase deferments among
 police and revolutionary development cadres.  The
 restrictions in the present bill were drafted in
 the Lower House and passed by a two-thirds majority.
 An Upper House version would have allowed the gov-
 ernment wide discretionary power.   Should the Lower
 House stick to its guns, it could easily defeat
 Thieu's amendments which require approval by an ab-
 solute majority of both houses meeting jointly.

 E France:   Holdouts in key industries and public
 services continue and a massive  "back to work" move-
 ment has failed to materialize.
 Although numerous small plants throughout the
 country have reopened, many key industries and
 services--public transport, auto and aircraft, chem-
 icals, steel, metallurgy, postal system, radio-TV--
 remain shut down.  To avoid being outflanked again
 by militant workers, all of the union leaders are
 insisting on "consultations" and approval by the
 strikers themselves of all tentative accords.   Most
 of the agreements hammered out in negotiations over
 the three-day holiday weekend go somewhat beyond
 the provisions of the "protocole d'accord" on 27
 May.   Strikers in some of the key sectors are now
 voting on whether to accept the agreements.
 Meanwhile, tensions appear to be increasing on
 the student front and moderates are being outmaneu-
 vered by radicals, an increasing number of whom now
 insist on a complete renovation of society by rev-
 olutionary means.   Elaborate networks of student-
 faculty committees have sprung up to draft reform
 plans, but even those professors who have been
 striving to work with the students are in many cases
 growing disillusioned with              student demands.

 Communist China:   Shifts in relative positions
 of officials attending major receptions in Peking
 indicate that the leadership is still in a state of
 flux.
 The most significant change disclosed by a
 namelist of officials at a 3 June reception was the
 downgrading of Li Fu-chun, the regime's top econo-
 mist, a subordinate of. Chou En-lai, and until now a
 member of the elite group around Mao Tse-tung.   Li
 was listed among ordinary politburo members instead
 of in his usual spot among standing committee mem-
 bers.
 Nieh Jung-chen, chairman of the National De-
 fense Scientific and Technological Commission and
 another Chou subordinate, is again being criticized
 in wall posters.  Nieh, in charge of coordinating
 China's advanced weapons projects, nevertheless con-
 tinues to appear publicly in his usual spot among
 politburo members.   Poster attacks on the commander
 b
 e
 of the 2nd Artillery Corps, the unit which may
 responsible for strategic missiles, have been re-
 Nieh and the corps were
 accused o  negligence ana   uandering resources.
 The corps commander has never been publicly identi-
 fied but the corps' political commissar, who appeared
 regularly and prominently last winter as its spokes-
 man, has been conspicuously absent from all turnouts
 since the purge of key military figures last March.
 Shifts in the order in which military figures
 are listed in the four most recent major turnouts
 since March indicate that several have been promoted,
 demoted, or transferred.   The significance of most
 of these changes is unclear.   In general, however,
 military leaders seem to be in a stronger political
 position than before.   In a break with previous
 practice, some senior officers who are not politburo

 members are now being listed among Mao's elite ahead
 of ordinary politburo members.
 Military men also continue to dominate the
 "revolutionary" governments being formed in the prov-
 inces.   Representatives from all five provinces not
 yet "revolutionized" attended the 3 June reception.
 The publicity accorded these men, who are mainly
 military officers, suggests that they have been se-
 lected to head the new government schedu II for their
 provinces.

 India - Southeast Asia:   Prime Minister Indira
 Gandhis recent 12-day tour of Singapore, Australia,
 New Zealand, and Malaysia symbolizes India's in-
 creasing interest in Southeast Asia, but signifi-
 cant commitments were avoided.
 Mrs. Gandhi characterized her trip, the first
 by an Indian prime minister in the region since the
 mid-1950s, as a good-will visit aimed at "getting
 to know India's neighbors better."   She kept pol-
 itical statements in the realm of generalities,
 consistent with the traditional Indian position of
 peaceful cooperation and nonalignment.
 The basic theme of Mrs. Gandhi's public state-
 ments was the need to minimize the "cold war atmos-
 phere" in the region.   She decried political al-
 liances that lead to antagonistic blocs.   She urged
 the promotion of economic stability as the region's
 primary requirement.   She carefully avoided any
 suggestion that India was currently prepared to
 play a role in filling the military vacuum left by
 the British.  An exception was her statement that
 as a result of Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Tun
 Abdul Razak's recent visit to New Delhi military
 training facilities and equipment would be extended
 on a bilateral basis.

 North Korea - USSR:   Pyongyang has repeated its
 dissatisfaction with the extent of Moscow's support
 for "revolutionary struggles."
 The North Koreans chose 28 May, the day a So-
 viet economic delegation arrived, for a thinly
 veiled attack on Moscow in the official party jour-
 nal.  The authoritative article stressed Pyongyang's
 view that the attitude taken by a Communist nation
 toward the US is the touchstone that distinguishes
 between a "revolutionary position and opportunism."
 Similar criticism after the seizure of the Pueblo
 indicated Pyongyang's apparent dissatisfaction over
 the limited support it had received from Moscow at
 that time.
 The delegation, headed by Soviet Deputy Premier
 Novikov, is in Pyongyang to attend the second ses-
 sion of the Soviet - North Korean economic and sci-
 entific technical consultative committee.

 USSR - Communist China:   Moscow is carefully
 documenting its case against the Chinese leader-
 ship, probably with a view toward the world Com-
 munist conference scheduled for November in Moscow.
 A series of editorial articles in the Soviet
 theoretical Party Journal Kommunist is preparing
 Moscow's brief on Mao's heresy in considerable
 detail.   The first two articles dealt largely with
 Mao's internal policies and the Cultural Revolu-
 tion.  The third, just reviewed in a TASS summary,
 condemns Chinese foreign policy.   The main thrust
 of the articles so far is that the Maoists have
 broken with Marxism, are attempting to liquidate
 the Chinese Communist Party, are motivated by nar-
 row Chinese nationalism, and have departed from
 all basic principles of socialist foreign policy.
 The most recent article specifically accuses
 the Chinese of attempting to use the Vietnam war
 to set the USSR and the US "on a collision course,"
 and of harboring expansionist plans "against in-
 dividual socialist countries, specifically against
 the Mongolian People's Republic."
 At the world meeting the Russians will prob-
 ably try to assert that Mao, by his own actions,
 has excluded the Chinese party from the Communist
 movement.  The USSR will encounter formidable ob-
 stacles if it attempts to force a formal, multi-
 lateral decree branding Peking anathema.  The
 carefully spelling out of the charges in the theo-
 retical journal at this time, however, suggests
 that Moscow at least intends to read its e into
 the record. F77             -1

 USSR - East Germany:   The Soviets last week
 reassured Ulbricht of their support.
 The communique ending the visit of the high-
 level East German party delegation hit especially
 hard at Bonn.   It again gave Moscow's public sup-
 port to Pankow's "protective measures" against al-
 leged West German designs on West Berlin. It claimed
 that the travel bans on certain West German citizens
 transiting East Germany were fully in accord with
 Pankow's rights and obligations under existing in-
 ternational agreements.
 The use of the word "obligations," however,
 may have been meant as a signal to Bonn and the Al-
 lies that Moscow intends to retain control over East
 German actions.   Soviet officials have privately in-
 dicated to Allied representatives that Moscow does
 not wish a crisis to develop.   The "emergency leg-
 islation" recently passed in Bonn drew only a prop-
 aganda broadside from the USSR, despite fears in
 some quarters that it would bring a more serious
 reaction.
 The communique made only an indirect reference
 to Czechoslovakia.   Nevertheless, its warning to
 the socialist countries to be vigilant and to close
 ranks against "imperialist machinations" was obvi-
 ously made with Prague uppermost in mind.   Ulbricht,
 the most vociferous critic of the recent trend in
 Czechoslovakia, probably would have preferred some-
 thing more explicit, but the Soviets have been re-
 straining their comments on the subject since Pre-
 mier Kosygin's visit.

 Czechoslovakia:  Party leaders have been drum-
 ming up support in key cities for the ouster of con-
 servatives from high party posts, acting as if they
 no longer expect Soviet pressures on this issue.
 Information on the sessions is sparse thus far,
 but presumably the speakers are following the lead
 of party first secretary Dubcek who on 3 June ad-
 dressed some 6,000 activists in Brno.  His theme was
 the rebuilding of the party, and popular confidence
 in it, largely on the basis of the reformist action
 program.
 For the first time in public Dubcek specif-
 ically lashed out at former party boss Novotny and
 his supporters.
 In his speech Dubcek charged the conservatives
 with attempting to undermine the new regime, even
 though they had been given a voice in determination
 of policy.  He again held out an olive branch, how-
 ever, to potential converts.
 Dubcek's discussion of domestic problems re-
 veals a heightened sensitivity--possibly reflecting
 his recent talks with Kosygin--about a number of
 specific issues which made the Soviets apprehensive
 about the course of Czechoslovak developments.  He
 agreed with the basic Soviet doctrine, for example,
 that the world was divided by "class struggle" but
 in the next breath he reasserted that this precept
 had no validity in today's Czechoslovakia.
 Dubcek also dutifully paid respect to the So-
 viet line that "some" anti-Communists were attempt-
 ing to take political advantage of the new climate,
 but he exuded confidence about his ability to con-
 trol such elements.   In fact, he credited these
 forces with showing "great restraint" so far.  He
 noted that "hostile" emigres and intelligence serv-
 ices had lately shown increased interest in Czech-
 oslovak affairs and that "hostile news agencies"

 were trying to disrupt party unity and relations be-
 tween Communist states.  None of these things seemed
 to concern him much, and he did not seem to believe--
 as the Soviet press has charged--that they meant his
 democratization process was being exploited by the
 West.

 Peru:   President Belaunde's Popular Action
 Party has taken a definite leftist tack with the
 nomination of Edgardo Seoane as its presidential
 candidate for the election next year.
 Seoane is first vice president of Peru and the
 leader of the "hot-head" faction that has controlled
 the party for a year.   In his acceptance speech he
 blamed the opposition Popular American Revolutionary
 Alliance for Peru's present economic difficulties
 and called for new taxes and state regulation of
 economy and investment.   He criticized "rich na-
 tions" for imposing unfavorable terms of trade on
 developing countries.
 The national convention also authorized forma-
 tion of a "broad front with all revolutionary forces
 of the left," and called for the immediate expro-
 priation of the "industrial complex" of the US-owned
 International Petroleum Company.
 These actions take the Popular Action Party
 even further away from Belaunde's moderate position.
 His defense of some of his supporters who were ex-
 pelled from the party was greeted by hisses.  Al-
 though Belaunde publicly welcomed Seoane's nomina-
 tion,  further leftward moves by the party could
 bring a complete rupture between the President and
 the party leadership.

 Sudan:   Another unstable government formed in
 Khartoum will almost certainly continue to follow
 the radical Arab nationalist line of its predeces-
 sor.
 The leftist Democratic Unionist Party  (DUP)
 won a heavy victory in the recently concluded elec-
 tions for the country's constituent assembly.   The
 DUP, a coalition of the urban-based National Union-
 ist Party and the sectarian People's Democratic
 Party, was formed last year as a marriage of con-
 venience, and its leaders are still at odds.   The
 DUP's position is further weakened by its necessary
 but tenuous alliance with one wing of the Umma
 Party.   The Umma is the political instrument of
 the Ansar religious sect--for over 80 years the
 major politico-religious force in the country.
 After considerable bickering and bargaining,
 a new cabinet was sworn in on 2 June.  The Umma's
 Mohammad Mahjoub has been reinstated as prime min-
 ister, but his mandate will be hampered by the ap-
 pointment of the left-leaning Sheik Ali Abd-al
 Rahman as deputy prime minister and foreign min-
 ister.   Sheik Ali, long a protege of Cairo and ru-
 mored to have both political and financial ties
 with Peking, probably will try to run the Foreign
 Ministry despite inevitable efforts by Mahjoub to
 remain the spokesman in foreign affairs.   Mahjoub
 has sought for the past few years to become the
 international leader in the Arab world, and prides
 himself on his sponsorship of the Arab summit that
 followed the Arab-Israeli war last year.
 There may be further baraairr;.ng and shifting
 of cabinet posts.   Former moderate prinle Minister
 Sadiq al-Mahdi, who lost his own post in the as-
 sembly during the elections, will be forced to re-
 main in the wings for some time.

 The new government's first mission is to pro-
 duce a constitution for the Sudan, but it will be
 unable to achieve this soon.         In addition, it
 faces serious financial problems and a rebellion by
 the Negroid population of the south.                                  25X1

 Jordan-Israel:   Yesterday's Israeli air
 strikes into Jordan and artillery exchanges along
 the border in the Irbid area further increased
 tensions on the first anniversary of the June war.
 The Israeli air strikes may have been in re-
 taliation for the death of several Israeli civilians
 during the initial artillery exchanges.
 The Jordanians have been nervous for some time
 over reports of an Israeli buildup in the northern
 border area.   The US defense attache in Tel Aviv
 believes, however,  that recent Israeli troop move-
 ments are precautions against possible Arab terror-
 ist attacks to mark the anniversary.   The Israelis
 are certainly determined to slap down any possible
 effort by either the terrorists or Arab military
 units to commemorate last year's debacle with a
 strike against Israel.

 Warsaw Pact:   Soviet signal troop contingents,
 probably from the neighboring Carpathian Military
 District, have arrived in eastern Czechoslovakia
 in preparation for the Warsaw Pact staff-command
 exercise this month.   Prague has described these
 contingents as "small" and states they will leave
 the country later in the month.   The pact chief of
 staff, Soviet General Kazakov, arrived in Czecho-
 slovakia a week ago.                                Kazakov apparently is direct-
 ing the work of the exercise planning  rou .
 Turkey:   The incumbent Justice Party  (JP),
 with 55 percent of the popular vote, ran well ahead
 of all other parties in last Sunday's senatorial
 and local elections but did not do as well as ex-
 pected.  Late returns, however, may somewhat boost
 the JP total.   These results are a further indica-
 tion that the JP will almost certainly retain power
 in next year's general elections.  The leftist Tur-
 kish Labor Party failed to win any of the main con-
 tests.
 The Turkish press estimated  that over 200,000
 people, or one out of every 65 eligible voters,
 were candidates for some office in the elections.
 At least 19 persons were killed and about 50 in-
 jured in widely scattered violence that marred some
 of the provincial balloting.   Most incidents in-
 volved family and local rivalries.
