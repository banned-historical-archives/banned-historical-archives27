SUMMARY 
Austerity Committees and People's Tribunals work diligently to settle corruption cases; 
workers are urged to help their employers restore production and State companies to give 
business to private firms, and businessmen are offered refunds on taxes and fines if only 
they will get business back to normal. Yet despite this anxiety to have done with the 
anticorruption drive, the apparent No. 1 aim of the broadcasting stations is to convince 
listeners that the drive has strengthened both capital and labor. Workers are credited 
with improving techniques, becoming. more efficient, and achieving a higher phAne by 
becoming "supervisors" of their employers. "Model accusers" and "model informers" who 
were rewarded with promotions are represented as accomplishing miracles in businela? 
though it was admitted only a few weeks ago that many of them were unable to handle their 
new jobs. Workers are promised higher wages, new houses, and better living conditions from 
the gains of the drive. The need for new houses is apparent. from a lamming admission 
that "no regular housing is available" for 90 percent of the city's workers; further 
disappointment may be in store, for in the Northeast higher housing allowances now are 
offset by higher rents. 
One noticeable result of the drive is the rising Importance of the Yeath Corps, Which has 
strengthened its membership with thousands Of enthusiastic anticorruption workers, many 
of them now assigned to Government positions, and seems to have assumed the task of 
supervising capital through its new members. Many of these are given special courses in 
business, along with political indoctrination. Another obvious result of the drive is 
the disclosure of inefficiency among State trading companies, which in some areas fulfilled 
only 80 percent of their 1951 contracts. A tightening of controls over these concerns 
is seen, with all major purchasing to be done through Central Government agencies, and.

the expense of farming operations. The Liu Cheng-ehang mutual-aid team organized e
