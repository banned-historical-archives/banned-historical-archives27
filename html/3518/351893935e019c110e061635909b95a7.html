I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC 
Communist China - Turkey - Iran: Chinese Communist 
Foreign Minister Chen Yi, currently in Afghanistan, has ex-
pressed a desire for private conversations with the Turkish 
and Iranian ambassadors resident in Kabul, 
Peiping has portrayed the re-
cent coup in Turkey as a successful "anti-imperialist strug-
gle" and probably feels the time is ripe to encourage closer 
relations with those Middle Eastern countries which have been 
hostile or lukewarm toward the Chinese Communist regime. 
(Page 1) 
Communist China: Concern for an increasingly precari-
ous food situation appears to have forced Peiping to make a 
number of important decisions on domestic economic policy, 
Including an increase in the relative priority accorded agricul-
ture. People's DailLon 25 August stated that agriculture must 
be place m t e most important position" as a long-term, rath-
er than temporary, policy in China's socialist construction. Top 
planner Li Fu- chun in the latest issue of Red Flag ascribes to 
agriculture more importance than has hitre"TtoThTen noted from 
an authoritative regime spokesman. An earlier article in the 
Chinese provincial press stated that, if necessary, the pace of 
industrial expansion would be slowed to permit a greater invest-
ment in agriculture. ) (Page 2)

Republic of the Congo: �The opening of a conference of Afri-

increased local unrest and threats of new violence. An estimated d-z-b-� 
1,000 Congolese--probably part of Leopoldville's 50,000 unem-

which was broken up by police. At the same time, UN troops 
/ 
at the Leopoldville airport prepared for a possible Congolese 
attempt to reoccupy the airport, which was placed under UN con-
trol on 21 August. 
About 1,000 Congolese soldiers have been airlifted to towns 
in Kasai Province near the Katanga border, in a move to block 
the establishment of a new province in Kasai and possible with a 
view toward invading Katanga. Although Lumumba probably hopes 
that this move will be endorsed by the visiting foreign ministers, 
there are indications that most African states deplore Lumumba's 
baiting of the UN and are  not disposed to support his military ven-
tures. (Page 3)

*Laos: New developments in the Laotian crisis seriously 
jeopardize prospects for a settlement along lines of the agree-
ment reached on 2:3 August between premier designate Souvanna 
Phouma and General Phoumi. The Pathet Lao radio has criticized 
the agreement as dangerously undercutting the Souvanna govern-
ment's authority and has called on all Laotians to oppose the "Phoumi 
rebel clique." On 25 August Phoumi is said to have stated that 
Souvanna was not keeping his word and obviously was not master 
of the situation in Vientiane. The agreed procedure for regularizing 
military control over Vientiane is snagged on rebel paratroop 
Captain Kong Le's reported demand for retention of effective 
command in the area, and there are indications that Phoumi is 
continuing to move his troops into position around the capital.

Peiping Approaches Turkish and Iranian Representatives  
Chinese Communist Foreign Minister Chen Yi, currently 
attending the Afghan independence celebrations, has expressed 
a desire for private conversations with the Turkish and Iranian 
ambassadors resident in Kabul. This is the first known approach 
Peiping has made for direct talks with either government, al-
though in 1956 it made a trade overture to Turkey through the 
Hungarians. 
The Chinese probably feel the time opportune for encourag-
ing closer, relations with those Middle Eastern countries which 
have remained hostile or lukewarm toward the Peiping regime. 
Chinese propaganda has characterized the recent coup in Turkey 
as a successful "anti-imperialist struggle" and Mao Tse-tung has 
referred to it in glowing terms in conversations with visiting neu-
tralist delegations. 
Peiping has made several efforts recently to improve its 
foreign elections with Asian countries. It has softened its ap-
proach to Indonesia over the problem of Overseas Chinese, has 
signed preliminary border agreements with Burma and Nepal, 
and has renewed its proposal for an "atom-free" zone in the 
Pacific. During his current trip to Kabul, Chen Yi hopes to ne-
gotiate a nonaggression treaty and technical aid agreement with 
the Afghans. In approaching Turkey and Iran, the Chinese prob-
ably hope that a show of good will from a Chinese official of 
Chen Yi's rank would be particularly appealing. 
(The Iranian ambassador has asked his government for in-
structions in responding to the Chinese bid. Neither Turkey nor 
Iran would appear to gain- any advantage from such a meeting, 
and the approach may be ignored. Should an informal meeting 
be arranged, primarily out of curiosity, the ambassadors would 
avoid any move designed to increase Chinese Communist pres-
tige and influence in the Middle East.

Agricultural Situation in China  
Official statements and reports by observers indicate that 
the food situation in China is decidedly tight in most places 
and probably grim in some. People's Daily, the official party 
organ, said recently that "we are still unable to produce enough 
food to meet the present need." Demands for the strictest aus-
terity in food consumption continue to emanate from all quarters. 
While there is no evidence to indicate that shortages have reached 
critical proportions, the balance betWeen food and population is 
becoming increasingly precarious with each passing year. 
The marked increase in official attention to agriculture ap-
parently reflects Peiping's growing awareness of this basic food 
problem and concern over the demonstrated inability of "leap 
forward" tactics, despite false statistical claims, to effect any 
real solution. The regime last fall acknowledged the need to de-
vote more attention to agriculture under the slogan of "taking agri-
culture as the foundation of the economy." Priority continued to 
be accorded to heavy industry, however, and this policy was re-
affirmed at a party congress as recently as last April. 
Domestic economic policy was evidently high on the agenda 
of a series of top-level party meetings believed to have been held 
in June and July. The first statement from an authoritative source 
to shed some light on the possible decisions reached at these meet-
ings was from planning chief Li Fu-chun who, in an article for the 
latest issue of Red Flag, ascribed to agriculture more importance 
than had the policy set forth late last year. Following the same 
line, People's Daily declared on 25 August that agriculture must 
be placed in the "most important position," not as a temporary 
but rather a long-term policy. ReferenceS to the priority of 
heavy industry were conspicuously absent in both cases. This 
appears to confirm signs that Peiping has decided to increase the 
relative priority accorded agriculture. An earlier article from 
the Chinese provincial press, reprinted in People's Daily, stated 
that, if necessary, the pace of industrial expansion would be slowed 
to permit a greater investment in agriculture.

The Situation in the Congo  
The opening of a conference of African foreign ministers 
in Leopoldville has been accompanied by increased local un-
rest and threats of new violence. An estimated 1,000 Congo-
lese�probably some of Leopoldville's 50,000 unemployed--
staged an anti-Lumumba demonstration on 25 August which 
was broken up by police. At the same time, UN troops at the 
Leopoldville airport prepared for a possible Congolese attempt 
to reoccupy the airport, which was placed under UN control 
on 18 August. aecretary General Hammarskjold has stated 
that he regards the Security Council resolution of 22 July as 
having given him authority to defend the airport by force if 
necessary.c 
Lumumba probably hopes that the visiting foreign minis-
ters will support his effort to regain control of the airport and 
to curb the secessionist trend. in Kasai. A UN force yielded 
to Congolese troops in a recent dispute over the control of en-
try points along the Congo River; Lumumba may feel that, 
backed by this precedent, he can reoccupy the airport, which 
has been run by the UN Command since Congolese soldiers 
molested a Canadian UN detachment on 18 August. 
Meanwhile, Lumumba has moved about 1,000 Congolese 
soldiers to Kasai Province, reportedly to the towns of Ganclajika 
and Luputa near the Katanga border. He may hope to isolate 
Bakwanga, the capital of the "Mang state" of southern Kasai, 
from contact with Katanga. President Tshombe reportedly has 
indicated to anti-Lumumba leaders in Kasai that he can furnish 
arms, though not troops, for use against Lumumba. Without 
aid from Katanga, however, the Kasai rebels have only about 
450 militia with which to confront Lumumba's forces, which 
may also be augmented by pro- Lumumba tribesmen in the prov-
ince. 
While most independent African states continue to favor a 
unified Congo, many have become critical of Lumumba follow-
ing his attacks against the UN and Secretary General Hammar-
skjold. The conferees at Leopoldville are expected to discuss

Haiti Threatened by Dominican Retaliation 
 reported 
preparations for possible Dominican military action against Haiti 
are part of an attempt to intimidate Haiti or reinforce the border 
to prevent anv invasion by anti-Truiillo forces using Haiti as a 
base. 
no anti-Trujillo group that might be preparing to invade the Do-
minican Republic from Haiti. 
Haiti, the country most vulnerable to Dominican retaliation 
� for the unanimous OAS vote condemning and applying sanctions 
against the Trujillo regime, cast its vote despite prior Dominican 
threats. One of these threats--to force repatriation of Haitian resi-
dents in the Dominican Republic--is already being carried out and 
this may account for the reported commandeering of trucks by the 
Dominican authorities on 23 August. About 16,500 Haitians were 
employed in the Dominican Republic during the recent sugar harvest 
and thousands of others have lived there for many years. Their sud-
den return will impose a serious burden on the weak Haitian econ-
omy. ahe Haitian foreign minister informed Secretary Herter on 
20 August that he fears Dominican reprisals may also take the form 
of subversive terrorism and economic sabotage'. 
Haiti and the Dominican Republic are historic enemies. Dur-
ing the 30-year Trujillo regime, superior Dominican military 
strength was often used to intimidate and pressure Haiti, and thous-
ands of Haitian workers were massacred in 1937 by Trujillo's army. 
On the other hand, Dominicans, who are predominantly of Spanish 
ancestry, still fear being overwhelmed by the numerically superior 
Haitian Negroes, as they were for over 20 years early in the last 
century. In fact, it was only after Trujillo's consolidation of power 
that Dominicans began to feel relatively safe from Haitian depreda-
tions. 
Haiti is one of the five Latin American countries that have not 
yet broken diplomatic relations with the Trujillo regime before or

Situation in Laos  
Serious obstacles have arisen to implementation of 
the 23 August agreement between premier designate 
Souvanna Phouma and General Phoumi for a compromise 
settlement of the Laotian crisis. Honest misinterpreta-
tions of the loosely drawn agreement may be part of the 
picture, but the trouble stems essentially from a con-
tinuing power struggle between the rightist, leftist, and 
neutralist factions involved. 
The Communist Pathet Lao, fearful that the staunchly 
anti-Communist Phoumi may emerge from the crisis with 
his influence virtually intact, has denounced the agreement 
as undercutting the authority of the neutralist Souvanna 
government and as being a great danger to the nation. A 
25 August broadcast over the clandestine Pathet Lao radio 
called on all Laotians to oppose the "Phoumi rebel clique 
and US imperialism." The possibility that the Pathet Lao 
will resort to force to prevent consummation of a compromise 
settlement between Souvanna and Phoumi cannot be excluded. 
In any case, the Pathets are not likely to heed Souvanna's 
25 August appeal to lay down their arms in the interests of 
national unity. 
Phoumi, meanwhile, is said t? have stated on 25 August 
that Souvanna was not keeping his word and obviously was 
not master of the situation in Vientiane. In part, he may

his troops into position around Vientiane.
