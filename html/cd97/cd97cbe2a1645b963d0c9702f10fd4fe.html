 There are continuing indications that Communist

 FAR EAST
 The long-heralded communist "summer campaign'
 in South Vietnam may be imminent.
 Mortar attacks on 29 May against US
 and Sout         ietnamese installations in Hue may have
 signaled the opening phase.   In northern Quang Tri
 Province,  the Communists are believed to have the
 capability of throwing up to three divisions into
 an offensive against allied forces.   The Communists
 are also continuing to build up their forces in the
 central highlands region of South Vietnam.
 The Hong Kong Government appears to have won
 the first round in the confrontation precipitated
 by pro-Communist forces.   Firm government measures
 have largely restored order in the colony,  although
 token strikes are continuing in an apparent effort
 to keep agitation alive while Peking considers its
 future course of action.   Chinese Communist propa-
 ganda pressure against the British has diminished
 somewhat.   There is no indication, however,  that
 Peking has decided to abandon the confrontation.
 The Chinese continue to demand acceptance of their
 mid-May demands but are portraying the contest as
 a protracted struggle which will not be quickly
 resolved.
 There have been no major developments in China's
 internal struggle.   Accounts of continuing widespread
 violence and conflicting editorials and party direc-
 tives appear to reflect confusion and disagreement
 among the leaders in Peking.

 VIETNAM
 There are continuing indica-
 tions that Communist forces are
 preparing to launch major coordi-
 nated operations in much of South
 Vietnam in the near future.   Al-
 lied operations,  however,                    appear
 in some cases to have at least
 temporarily disrupted the Commu-
 nists'  timetable for a summer
 offensive.
 In northern I Corps, North
 Vietnamese forces are continuing
 to reinforce and consolidate po-
 sitions in and near the Demili-
 tarized Zone  (DMZ),  along the Lao-
 tian border, and in the A Shau
 Valley.   It is not yet possible
 to determine to what extent the
 over-all enemy capability has
 been affected by recent allied
 ground operations in the south-
 eastern portion of the DMZ and
 the accompanying air effort north
 of the zone.   These actions, how-
 ever,  have probably reduced the
 threat of imminent large-scale
 ground and artillery attack
 against US Marine positions in
 northeastern Quang Tri Province.
 The North Vietnamese forces in
 this area lost nearly 800 killed
 in the US Marine/South Vietnamese
 operations conducted there from
 17 to 28 May.   However,  the
 enemy is still believed capable
 of attacking across the entire
 DMZ with as many as three full
 infantry divisions.
 In addition, multiregimental
 entities  (one in western Quang
 Tri Province and another in north-
 eastern Thua Thien Province be-
 longing to the Communists'  North-
 ern Front)  are capable of support-
 ing a coordinated offensive thrust
 in these two provinces.   The
 Northern Front concentration
 poses a particularly serious
 threat to isolated allied tar-
 gets between Quang Tri city and
 Hue as well as to these provin-
 cial capitals themselves.
 In the central coastal re-
 gions of I and II Corps, US Army
 Operations PERSHING and MALHEUR
 inflicted losses in excess of
 2,000 killed on elements of both
 the Second and Third North Viet-
 namese Army divisions in the past
 several months.   This probably
 has been primarily responsible
 for delaying a major offensive in
 this area.
 In the central highlands the
 Communists'  "B-3 Front" command
 is capable of attacking allied po-
 sitions in Pleiku and Kontum prov-
 inces with one division plus two
 regiments.   Major elements of
 the 32nd,  66th,  88th,  and 95 "B"
 North Vietnamese regiments are
 presently in western Pleiku,  re-
 portedly with the mission of

 Saigon Politics
 The early optimism among
 Premier Ky's supporters regard-
 ing his prospects for the presi-
 dency has diminished in recent
 weeks.   Former Premier Tran Van
 Huong's firm entry into the race
 last week has quashed rumors, at
 least for the time being, that
 he might align himself on a Ky
 ticket.   There are some reports,
 nonetheless,  that Ky and Huong
 privately have reached an "under-
 standing" concerning the future
 premiership in the event either
 of them wins the election.
 The continuing vacillation
 of Chief of State Thieu about
 entering the presidential race
 is still complicating the politi-
 cal picture, and especially the
 role which the military can play
 in the contest.   Although Thieu
 ment.   While he continues to as-
 sess the political scene, and in
 particular,  the US attitude to-
 ward present and prospective
 candidates, Thieu has reportedly
 acquired the support of Foreign
 Minister Tran Van Do for his own
 candidacy.   Ky, who previously
 indicated that he might withdraw
 if Thieu entered the contest,
 now has told newsmen that he is
 in the race to stay.
 Despite the potentially
 divisive consequences of a con-
 test between the two military
 leaders for the presidency,  the
 military establishment has not
 yet shown signs of strain.   Much
 of the credit for easing the ten-
 sion is due to the efforts of
 Bui Diem, the ambassador to the
 US who recently returned on leave
 to help Ky form a political or-
 ganization.   Diem has effectively
 counseled both Ky and Police Di-
 rector Loan to exercise patience
 while at the same time he has been
 able to communicate with Thieu.
 At this stage, a four-way
 race by Ky, Thieu, Huong,  and
 Phan Khac Suu, the head of the
 Constituent Assembly, is a dis-
 tinct possibility.   A month re-
 mains to file applications, how-
 ever.                                       25X1
 The initiative to alter
 the balance of power probably
 now rests more with. General Thieu
 than with the others.

 COMMUNIST-LED UNREST EASES IN HONG KONG
 Firm measures by the Hong
 Kong Government against Communist-
 led agitators have largely re-
 stored order to the colony.   Pe-
 king, however,  is maintaining its
 propaganda pressure on the British
 although at a reduced level.
 Local Communists are continu-
 ing token strikes in government-
 run utilities in an effort to keep
 agitation alive.   The Communists
 are also trying to expand their
 support by intimidating non-Com-
 munist laborers and have staged
 partially successful strikes in
 the textile industry.
 British authorities are tak-
 ing stringent measures to curb
 the strikes.   One official has
 stated that government employees
 are subject to summary dismissal
 if an unauthorized work stoppage
 exceeds 24 hours.   The British
 helicopter assault ship Bulwark,
 carrying commandos,  arrived in
 the colony last week to demon-
 strate London's firm support for
 the colonial government.
 On 27 May Chinese Foreign
 Minister Chen Yi again called for
 immediate and unconditional Brit-
 ish acceptance of Peking's de-
 mands of 15 May and warned that
 China "would not sit idly by" if
 alleged atrocities against the
 Hong Kong population continued.
 However, Peking also has referred
 to the struggle against the Brit-
 ish as having gone on for more
 than a century,  suggesting that
 no quick resolution is contem-
 es's
 plated.   An authoritative Peoples's
 Daily article on 29 May accusing
 the British of "gunboat diplomacy"      25X1
 for bringing the Bulwark and other
 naval ships into Hong Kong omitted
 any mention of the demands.
 DISORDER CONTINUES IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 Violent clashes and disorder
 involving Red Guards continue to
 be reported from many parts of
 China, but the over-all situation
 remains obscure.
 New provinces where bloody
 clashes reportedly have broken
 out in the past week are Kwangsi
 in the south and Chekiang in the
 east.   In both provinces,  accord-
 ing to Red Guard wall posters
 displayed in Peking,  local army
 troops have joined forces with
 anti-Maoist elements to suppress
 revolutionary forces.   The same
 charge is made in current poster
 accounts of bloody incidents

 Many of the poster reports

 poster in Peking on 27 May warned
 that railway Red Guards in Honan
 would strike if the army continued

 30 May the Honan provincial radio
 station retaliated by charging
 that the railroad had been "sabo-
 taged"  three days earlier by "con-
 servative" forces critical of
 the army.
 Peking continues to display
 a marked ambivalence on Red Guards'
 activity. A Red Guard newspaper
 on 24 May reported that the central
 committee that day had issued a
 seven-point instruction which or-
 dered Red Guard media not to pub-
 licize accounts of speeches and
 events of party concern without
 prior approval.   Other Peking pro-
 nouncements,  however,  indicate that
 important party leadership ele-
 ments in Peking are pushing for
 an even more vigorous purge of
 high officials, both in Peking
 and the provinces.
 An editorial in Red Flag and
 People's Daily on 16 May went so
 far as to praise Stalin's elimi-
 nation of Trotsky, Bukharin, and
 many other leaders.   Stalin had
 erred,  the editor=ial stated, only
 in supposing that the revolution
 had been finally settled by the
 liquidation of these men.
 This editorial and a similarly
 vitriolic one of 8 May--which
 slashed out again at Liu Shao-chi's
 book How To Be a Good Communist--
 have been widely publicized as
 guides for conducting the Cul-
 tural Revolution, that is,  for
 carrying out the purge of Mao's
 enemies.
 The identity of Mao's ene-
 mies is no clearer than it has
 been, however, probably indicat-
 ing that current leaders in Pe-
 king are still in disagreement
 over who should be purged.   For
 example, wall posters put up in
 Peking on 19 May denounced by
 name a deputy commander of the
 Heilungkiang Military District
 in the far northeast for ordering
 his troops to fire on Red Guards
 who were holding a rally.   On 25
 May,  however,  People's Daily seem-
 ingly went out of its way to en-
 dorse this controversial military
 officer.   It published an article
 attributed to him,  commemorating
 the 25th anniversary of a famous
 speech on art and literature by
 Mao Tse-tung.

 GOVERNMENT PARTY FAVORED IN SOUTH KOREAN ELECTIONS
 President Pak Chong-hui's
 Democratic Republican Party  (DRP)
 is expected to retain control of
 South Korea's National Assembly
 in the elections on 8 June, but
 with a reduced majority.   The
 same factors which helped Pak
 gain a solid victory in the pres-
 idential election in April--no-
 tably the country's growing pros-
 perity and the regime's effective
 electioneering--will also benefit
 DRP candidates in the legislative
 elections.
 The psychological advantage
 gained by Pak's victory has been
 partially offset, however, by the
 public furor generated by the ar-
 rest of three minor opposition
 figures for their statements dur-
 ing the campaign.   The impression
 of government heavy-handedness
 was strengthened when the cabinet
 changed the rules for the assembly
 election campaign to permit top
 government officials to partici-
 pate.   All this could cost the
 DRP  some  seats  in addition to
 those that party strategists al-
 ready believe might be lost as
 the result of local issues.   Kim
 Chong-pil, Pak's close political
 adviser, has estimated that the
 party could lose as many as ten
 of the 112 seats it presently
 holds in the unicameral 175-seat
 legislature.
 The electoral system which
 provides that 44 of the 175 seats
 must be  apportioned according to
 each party's total vote will help
 the DRP  retain control.   The win-
 ping party is assured a minimum
 of 22 of these seats.   The second
 party is guaranteed at least  two
 thirds of those remaining.
 A new DRP majority is likely
 to be more responsive to presi-
 dential control than the old one
 was.   The list of DRP candidates
 is consistent with Pak's policy
 of maintaining a balance among
 the party factions and appears
 designed to minimize the infight-
 ing that aggravated relations be-
 tween the regime and the out-
 going assembly.
 The leading opposition group,
 the New Democratic Party  (NDP)
 also stands to benefit from the
 electoral system, which is de-
 signed to favor an essentially
 two-party legislature.   The NDP,
 however,  is handicapped by a
 plethora of candidates from other
 opposition parties in some dis-
 tricts which it might otherwise
 expect to win.
 Although the NDP's position
 as the second party appears as-
 sured,                                                                              there is likely to be a
 considerable turnover among its
 individual candidates.   Factional
 loyalties dictated that antiregime
 intransigents be given an almost
 equal place on the ticket with
 more moderate elements.   Thus,
 there could be a return to the
 obstructionist tactics used by
 the opposition prior to 1965 when
 many of the hard liners resigned
 from the assembly.

 SIHANOUK ATTACKS CAMBODIAN LEFT
 Chief of State Sihanouk is
 waging a new campaign against
 leftist influence in Cambodia.
 The apparent scope and intensity
 of his effort go far beyond any
 of his attacks on the left in re-
 cent years.
 Last year, when sharp left-
 ist losses in National Assembly
 elections and the installation
 of the rightist Lon Nol govern-
 ment precipitated a series of un-
 precedented leftist demonstra-
 tions throughout Cambodia, Si-
 hanouk confined his response to
 verbal warnings.   A subsequent
 outbreak of peasant dissidence in
 western Cambodia, however,  and
 the sudden disappearance of two
 leading leftists under mysterious
 circumstances clearly signaled a
 serious threat to Sihanouk's ef-
 fort to preserve a balance be-
 tween Cambodia's left and right.
 In late April, Sihanouk dismissed
 the Lon Nol government and re-
 placed it with one which had some
 leftist representation.
 At the same time, Sihanouk
 made it clear that further left-
 ist agitation would be met with
 more forceful measures.   He
 launched his sharpest attack in
 the current campaign against the
 leftists in a speech on 9 May,
 charging that their activities
 were foreign inspired and threat-
 ened the stability of the nation.
 He singled out the Chinese com-
 munity as a center of subversion
 and warned that "fled Guard" ac-
 tivity would not be permitted in
 Cambodia.
 Two leading Chinese busi-
 nessmen who had close ties with
 the Chinese Communist Embassy were
 deported to China in mid-May de-
 spite Peking's efforts on their
 behalf.   Their deportations were
 clearly meant as a warning to left-
 ists,  in addition to being part
 of Sihanouk's renewed effort to        25X1
 curtail smuggling to the Viet Cong
 more deporta-
 tions may be in the offing, but
 it is unlikely that they will re-      25X1
 sult in more than a temporary dis-
 ruption in smuggling operations.
 The future course of Siha-
 nouk's campaign will largely de-
 pend on the leftists'  response.
 There are already indications that
 the leftists in Phnom Penh have
 drastically curtailed their propa-
 ganda activities.   If the left-
 ists continue to acquiesce,  it is
 unlikely that Sihanouk will fol-
 low the advice of rightists who
 advocate a major purge.
 Although he has charged that
 the leftists are receiving support
 from their "masters" abroad he is
 anxious to avoid significant dam-
 age to Cambodia's relations with
 Pekin   and Hanoi.

 PHILIPPINE GOVERNMENT CONCERNED OVER INCREASED HUK ACTIVITY
 The Philippine Government is
 increasingly concerned about an
 expansion in the activities of
 the pro-Communist Huks.
 A recent Senate inquiry
 reflects Manila's growing aware-
 ness of the Huks'  ability to ex-
 ploit the widespread disaffection
 in central Luzon, caused by mass
 poverty,  injustice and maladmin-
 istration.   The Senate's report
 cited a substantial increase in
 the number of armed Huks over
 the past two years to a possible
 200-300, plus an additional serv-
 ice support group of 900-1,000
 and a mass base of 26,000-29,000
 persons who sympathize with or
 passively accept Huk control.
 The report noted that the govern-
 ment's failure to implement an
 effective reform program had
 caused the farmers to look out-
 side official circles for relief.
 Although traditionally based
 in the provinces of Pampanga and
 Tarlac, the Huks now appear to
 be making a concerted effort to
 expand their influence.   Armed
 groups have been noted in several
 other provinces of central Luzon
 on missions to recruit new mem-
 bers,  collect "taxes" and sup-
 plies,  and establish safehavens
 for their paramilitary bands.
 The Huks also have frequent con-
 tacts with local politicians to
 prepare strategy for the off-year
 congressional elections in Novem-
 ber.   Their considerable influence
 has resulted in widespread official
 connivance in their activities.
 Since their defeat in the
 early 1950s,  the Huks have appeared

 more as bandits and extortionists,

 under the increasing direction
 and indoctrination of the out-
 lawed Philippine Communist Party

 trol is unclear, but the Huk
 "Supremo," Pedro Taruc,  is a mem-
 ber of a three-man committee
 which has assumed the duties of
 the party's imprisoned secretary
 general,  and recently captured
 documents reveal resumed Commu-
 nist indoctrination activities
 among the Huks.
 The recent attempts by
 urban-based pro-Communist front
 groups to extend their activities
 into rural Luzon may lead to a
 greater PKP effort at coordina-

 little progress.   The Philippine
 constabulary has recently been con-

 against the armed Huk bands and is

 The greatest hindrance to the gov-

 Moscow's attention last week was still directed
 largely at exploiting the opportunities offered by
 the Arab-Israeli crisis.   The Soviets showed no in-
 clination toward entering into serious multilateral
 discussions for calming the situation.   Soviet treat-
 ment of the Vietnam situation was routine.
 Rumania's party chief Ceausescu visited Hungary
 last week but brought no change in the cool relations
 between the two countries.   Hungary's Kadar had an-
 nounced the visit on the day Walter Ulbricht arrived
 in Budapest to sign the East German - Hungarian mu-
 tual defense treaty and thus appeared to be trying
 to keep open his options on the question of recog-
 nizing West Germany--a move Rumania made in January.
 The chilly communique issued by Kadar and Ceau-
 sescu, however,  striking for its brevity and lack of
 the usual cliches,  suggested that the two chiefs had
 been unable to agree on anything.   Rumania's stri-
 dently independent stand in the Communist world and
 its "Rumanianization" policy toward the sizable Hun-
 garian minority in Transylvania apparently prevented
 any chance of successful talks.   Bucharest may again
 find itself confronted with renewed agitation among
 its Hungarian minority by "outside forces."
 The meeting in Rome this week of the leaders
 of the Common Market states was no diplomatic tri-
 umph for De Gaulle.   The French were pressed hard
 for an early response to Britain's bid to join, and
 the issue is now on the agenda of the EEC Council
 meeting of 6 June.

 CONFORMITY CARRIES THE DAY AT USSR WRITERS' CONGRESS
 The USSR's long-awaited,
 carefully prepared Fourth Writers'
 Congress closed last weekend with
 conservative forces in full charge.
 The liberal elements, who favor
 greater freedom of expression
 were maneuvered into a defensive
 position,  and were hardly heard
 at all.
 The only break in the steady
 drone at the congress came from
 the orthodox side when Nobel Prize
 winner Mikhail Sholokhov com-
 plained that the conservative
 cause was not being pushed vig-
 orously enough and charged that
 the "appeasement" atmosphere was
 putting delegates to sleep.  Sho-
 lokhov also scored Svetlana Sta-
 lina's decision to leave the
 USSR,  referring to her as the
 "defector Alliluyeva."   The na-
 tional press has since expanded
 the attack on her,  and it thus
 appears that after three months
 of official silence,  the char-
 acter assasination of Svetlana
 has begun.
 The congress revised the
 charter of the Writers' Union to
 underscore its political-ideolog-
 ical function,  tightened admis-
 sion requirements,  and provided
 for official reprimands for any
 member whose work overstepped the
 bounds of the charter.   Novelist
 Konstantin Fedin,  a relatively
 passive head of the Writers'
 Union since 1959, was re-elected
 as the least offensive candidate
 available..
 There were reports of sub-
 surface ferment at the congress,
 however,  and several. prominent
 liberals are said to have circu-
 lated letters of dissent.   The
 most controversial was reportedly
 from novelist Konstantin Paustov-
 sky whose article in Literary
 Gazette during the 1959 Congress
 was a forceful defense of the
 liberal position.   Another let-
 ter,  from novelist Aleksandr Sol-
 zhenitsyn,  reportedly told of
 persecution at the hands of the
 regime and appealed to the Writ-
 ers'  Union to safeguard writers'
 rights.   In contrast to the 1954
 and 1959 congresses, however, the
 liberals'  case was not presented
 publicly.
 With the exception of Sholo-
 khov's philippic, the over-all
 tone of the congress epitomized
 the regime's whole cultural pol-
 icy--conformity without scandal.
 Khrushchev's stop-and-go liberal-
 ization  led  to the publication
 of  nonconformist  works which then
 had to be criticized publicly.
 Tighter prepublication controls
 during the past two years have
 come close to shutting off the
 flow of such works.   So long as
 these controls are effective, the
 regime can afford a gesture to the
 liberals here and there.   At the
 congress this amounted to a moment
 of silence for Writers'  Union mem-
 bers who had died since the last
 congress--among them Boris Pas-
 ternak--and the election of lib-
 erals Aleksandr Tvardovsky and
 Andrey Voznesensky to a governing     25X1
 board otherwise heavily weighted

 THE ROME SUMMIT
 The meeting in Rome this
 week of the leaders of the six
 EEC countries left no doubt that
 De Gaulle will use delaying
 tactics to keep Britain out of
 the community as long as possi-
 ble.   Faced with clear indica-
 tions during the meeting that
 the others want the British
 in, however,  De Gaulle acquiesced
 to examination of the issue at
 next week's meeting in Brussels
 of the EEC Council.
 How the issue will be ap-
 proached in Brussels remains un-
 certain.   The Five want to get
 agreement on an early start of
 negotiations with London,  and
 need initially a decision on how
 to reply to the British applica-
 tion under the Rome Treaty's
 Article 237--procedures for ac-
 cession to full membership.   In
 order to counter a possible move
 by De Gaulle to offer an "in-
 terim"  associate status for the
 UK, London again advised the
 Five before the summit session
 that such a prospect held no in-
 terest for the UK Government.
 At Rome, De Gaulle appar-
 ently insisted on the need for
 "taking time" to study the ef-
 fects on the community of UK
 entry.   Article 237 calls on
 the Council to "take the opinion
 of the Commission" before de-
 ciding by a unanimous vote on a
 membership request.   Paris seems
 to interpret this provision as re-
 quiring that the Council receive
 the Commission's advice before ne-
 gotiations with a prospective new
 member begin.   The French, more-
 over,  raised doubts whether the
 present Commission--which will
 be replaced on 1 July by a new
 Commission merging the EEC Com-
 mission with the executives of
 EURATOM and the Coal-Steel Com-
 munity--should be entrusted with
 this task.   The new Commission
 will need time,  they say,  to re-
 apportion work and to reorganize
 before it can examine the British
 question.
 These arguments are unlikely
 to impress the Five, but it is un-
 certain how far they are prepared
 to go in trying to force a de-
 cision now.   Belgium,  the Nether-
 lands,                                                                          and Italy all strongly
 reiterated in Rome their commit-
 ment to early negotiations. Ear-
 lier,  the Germans had told the
 British of their strong desire
 for beginning negotiations soon.
 Although Bonn may still be in-
 clined to find a "middle ground"
 between the French and,  for ex-
 ample, the Dutch,  the Kiesinger
 government is increasingly sensi-
 tive to charges that it has been
 overly deferential to Paris and
 "lukewarm" toward London.   For-

 Strauss,  and Economic Minister
 Schiller have all recently sup-
 ported British membership in
 strong terms.
 The question of a successor
 to EEC President Hallstein is
 still undecided.   The Six agreed
 in Rome that the new Commission
 should become operative on 1 July,
 but apparently did not reach a
 final verdict on its membership.
 Jean Rey, an EEC vice president
 and the community's negotiator
 in the Kennedy Round, reportedly
 has the edge for the chairmanship
 if no suitable Italian candidate
 can be found.
 The heavy focus on the Brit-
 ish question at Rome seems to have
 reliance on US power and on Eu-
 rope's relative weakness in the
 delayed any decisive move toward
 instituting Gaullist style politi-
 cal consultations among the Six.
 The foreign ministers were di-
 rected only to examine the prob-
 lem.   The Six are reported also
 to have discussed the Middle East
 crisis.   The Suez crisis in 1956--
 which demonstrated the incapacity
 of the individual European na-
 tions to defend their interests--
 strengthened the supporters of
 European unity at that time,  and
 the new troubles seem likely to
 provoke further reflection in Eu-
 rope both on Europe's continued       25X1

 MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA
 Nasir's soaring popularity with the Arab masses
 outside Egypt was highlighted on 30 May when Jordan's
 King Husayn,  in a reversal forced on him by the ram-
 pant pro-Nasirism,                         signed a mutual defense pact with
 Egypt.   The Egyptian President's ultimate touch was
 to have among those who witnessed the signing Husayn's
 archenemy, Ahmad Shukayri,  chief of the Palestine
 Liberation Organization which plans and conducts
 raids into Israel through Jordan.   Both Israel and
 the Arab states are maintaining a high state of
 readiness in their military dispositions.   Iraq,
 Kuwait,  and other Arab states now have pledged troops,
 and military circles in North Africa have indicated
 they would come to Nasir's aid in the event of hos-
 tilities.
 For the time being,  shipping to the Israeli
 port of Eilat in the Gulf of Aqaba has largely been
 diverted.   Foreign Minister Eban has warned, however,
 that Israel will act alone to break an Arab blockade
 if no effective international action is taken soon.
 In Greece,  the regime has announced the member-
 ship of the committee to revise the constitution as
 promised earlier this month.   The committee is to
 complete its work in six months, but other recent
 actions by the coup group indicate it intends to
 maintain control for a considerably longer time.
 New arrests of both center and conservative former
 deputies for their "villainous acts"  illustrate the
 coup leaders'  determination not "to terminate the
 life of the revolution before it fulfills its task."
 The declaration of independence by Eastern Gov-
 ernor Ojukwu on 30 May signals the end of the Ni-
 gerian federation.   The head of the federal govern-
 ment has alerted his army,  and declared a blockade
 of the East.   He may also support guerrilla activity
 in the Eastern minority tribal areas, which Ojukwu
 would have difficulty in containing.

 THE ARAB-ISRAELI CRISIS
 The build-up in Arab support for
 Nasir's stand on transit through
 the Gulf of Aqaba and the pressures
 within Israel for a cabinet reshuf-
 fle in favor of the hawks add new
 dimensions to the Arab-Israeli con-
 frontation.
 Jordan's King Husayn, appar-
 ently to buy political and military
 insurance,  signed a five-year mutual
 defense pact with President Nasir in
 Cairo on 30 May.   The Egyptians
 capped the signing ceremony by in-
 cluding Husayn's archenemy, Ahmad
 Shukayri, chief of the Palestine
 Liberation Organization  (PLO).   The
 PLO is mostly responsible for the
 terrorist raids into Israel through
 Jordan--raids which Husayn had for
 some time tried to restrain.   The
 pact, couched in general terms simi-
 lar to those of the November 1966
 Syrian-Egyptian agreement,  includes
 a provision that "in the event of
 the beginning of military operations,
 the chief of staff of the UAR armed
 forces shall assume command of op-
 erations in both states."
 The defense pact places on the
 Nasir bandwagon practically all Arab
 leaders except King Fa sal of Saudi
 Arabia.
 Nasir has indicated that: he
 is prepared to make peace with Fay-
 sal and will send him a letter to
 that effect via Husayn.   Husayn has
 apparently asked Faysal to visit
 Amman for talks on the current cri-
 sis.   Saudi Arabia has mobilized
 its forces.   Although this is prob-
 ably only the recall of men on leave,
 the Saudis cannot afford politically
 to be too far behind in Nasir's
 parade.
 General Arab mobilization con-
 tinues, and there have been other
 Arab political moves to bolster
 Nasir. Morocco has promised to place
 troops at Egypt's disposal in the
 event of war. Cairo now has accepted
 one Iraqi infantry battalion and
 announced on 31 May that Kuwaiti
 troops are already in Egypt.
 In the political field, the
 Iraqi Government has called for a
 meeting of Arab oil-producing states
 on 4 June, presumably to set common
 policy on oil sales.   Kuwait has al-

 EASTERN NIGERIA DECLARES INDEPENDENCE
 Nigeria's drawn-out political
 crisis culminated on 30 May in the
 long-threatened secession of the
 Eastern Region, a move which now
 could start a civil war.   Lt. Col.
 Gowon, federal government head,
 quickly responded by alerting his
 9,000-man army, mostly Northerners,
 and ordering a total blockade of the
 East.
 Eastern Governor Ojukwu's proc-
 lamation came just three days after
 he had been given a mandate by the
 region's Consultative Assembly to
 secede when he deemed the time was
 ripe.   The assembly's resolution
 also held open the door for future
 loose association with the other re-
 gions and with other African coun-
 tries.
 Ojukwu's long-threatened move
 was triggered by Gowon's declaration
 of a state of emergency, which he
 made on 27 May upon hearing of Ojuk-
 wu's mandate.  At the same time,
 Gowon also had assumed full execu-
 tive and legislative powers for him-
 self--an illegal act under his re-
 cently decreed constitution--and had
 created 12 new states out of the
 existing four regions.   Three new
 states were formed in the East, two
 of which encompass minority tribal
 areas that have a long history of
 opposing Ibo domination and that

 Thus far,  Gowon's only direct
 move to oppose the East's secession
 has been to reimpose stringent eco-
 nomic sanctions, most of which had
 been in effect until lifted just
 over a week ago.   he also has re-
 portedly ordered his small navy to
 blockade Eastern ports.   In addi-
 tion, the military build-up in the
 North along the border with the
 East is reportedly continuing.   As
 yet there has been no attack on the
 East, although Gowon is reportedly
 planning some sort of military ac-
 tion.   This could include support
 for guerrilla operations by Eastern
 minority tribes aimed at separat-
 ing the newly decreed states from
 Ojukwu's control.   Unless Gowon
 moves decisively against Ojukwu,
 Ibo-hating Northern soldiers might
 move on their own.   For the present

 The mood in "Biafra"--the name

 SOMALI PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION UPCOMING
 While the specific date of
 Somalia's presidential election
 is yet to be announced by the
 National Assembly,  it appears
 likely to be held during the
 first week in June.   The election
 is the second since independence
 in 1960 and will be decided by
 the 123 deputies of the National
 Assembly.   A two thirds majority
 (82)  is required on the first
 ballot,  and a simple majority
 (62)  on any subsequent vote.
 Although at first unenthu-
 siastic about continuing in office,
 incumbent President Aden Abdullah
 Osman eventually announced his
 candidacy for a second six-year
 term.   His only declared opponent
 is former prime minister Abdiras-
 cid Ali Schermarke, although sev-
 eral government figures have been
 mentioned as alternates should
 the assembly fail to decide on
 either Aden or Abdirascid.
 In his six years as head
 of state, Aden has won the respect
 of most Somali political leaders
 and has succeeded in raising the
 office of president somewhat above
 partisan politics.   He has coun-
 seled restraint--often in opposi-
 tion to Somali public opinion--
 with regard to Somali irredentist
 claims in neighboring Ethiopia,
 Kenya,  and French Somaliland.
 Abdirascid has been angling
 for the presidency since Aden
 dropped him as prime minister in
 early 1964.    He has been actively
 campaigning in the assembly for
 over a month, reportedly passing
 out funds he has collected from
 foreign Communist sources.   In
 contrast to Aden, he is more mili-
 tant in his approach to Somali
 expansionism.   His tenure as prime
 minister was marked by substantial
 material support to Somali insur-
 gents in Ethiopia's Ogaden region
 which led to the 1964 border
 clashes between the two countries.
 His acceptance of considerable So-
 viet military and economic aid had
 enabled the USSR to maintain sub-
 stantial influence in Somalia.
 Because tribal alliances are
 a prime factor in the operations
 of the National Assembly, Aden
 is considered stronger than
 Abdirascid or any other potential
 rival.   His own tribal connections
 and those of his supporters, Prime
 Minister Abdirazak and several
 cabinet members and politicians
 from other tribal groups and po-
 litical parties,  appear to give
 him the advantage.   There also
 is an indication that the approx-
 imately 30 deputies reportedly
 committed to Abdirascid may be
 wavering in their support.   Since
 the use of bribery is also an
 important ingredient of Somali
 politics, however,  the outcome
 could depend on which candidate
 has the most funds..
 Despite Aden's moderate ap-
 proach to Somalia's external prob-
 lems, his victory would notensure any
 substantial lessening of tension       25X1
 between Somalia and its neighbors.

 WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 Political tensions continue throughout the
 hemisphere, and riots broke out in the French West
 Indies island of Guadeloupe last week.
 The riots were a spontaneous outgrowth of a
 month-long strike, and were fueled by economic and
 racial grievances.   Security forces brought the
 rioters under control on 28 May, but not until at
 least five persons had been killed and 60 wounded.
 The arrest of 16 Haitian military officers,
 the first cabinet reshuffle since November 1965,
 and the replacement of a number of President Duva-
 lier's representatives in outlying cities have
 coincided with the development of a bitter feud in
 Duvalier's own family that could have severe politi-
 cal consequences.
 Border clashes on 29 and 30 May between Hon-
 duran and Salvadoran troops resulted in several
 casualties on both sides.   A bilateral commission
 is investigating the incidents,  and no break in re-
 lations is expected.
 A budding political crisis in Peru was averted
 when an eleventh-hour compromise postponed a major
 confrontation between the Belaunde administration
 and the opposition-controlled Congress over how to
 handle the serious fiscal situation.   In neighbor-
 ing Ecuador,  the turbulent political scene will
 change only slightly as a result of the constituent
 assembly's completion of the new constitution--the
 country's 17th since 1830.
 Meanwhile,  student unrest persists in Brazil.
 President Costa e Silva and Education Minister         25X1
 Dutra are convinced that the students are deliber-
 ately seeking an opportunity to test the strength
 of the new government.

 POLITICAL TENSION MOUNTS IN HAITI
 A recent series of military
 and government shake-ups in Haiti
 is the latest indication that
 President Duvalier's power base
 has undergone considerable ero-
 sion during the last year.   Am-
 bassador Timmons predicts that
 "the final act in this drama
 could come at any time."
 At least 16 military officers
 were arrested in late May. Some
 of them had held important posts
 in the elite Presidential Guard,
 and many had ties with Duvalier's
 ambitious son-in-law Colonel Max
 Dominique.
 Dominique has pro--
 tested by submitting his resigna-
 tion, but the President is not
 known to have accepted or rejected
 it.
 In addition to the military
 shake-ups, Duvalier reshuffled
 his cabinet last week,  for the
 first time since November 1965,
 and replaced a number of national
 representatives and municipal au-
 thorities in outlying cities.
 This flurry of activity coincides
 with a time of increasing finan-
 cial hardship and international
 isolation for the Duvalier regime.
 Last fall Duvalier foiled
 an incipient conspiracy by announc-
 ing the "retirement" of five Gen-
 eral Staff officers and the dis-
 missal from service of at least
 15 others.   This development came
 hard on the heels of rare antigov-
 ernment demonstrations and protests
 in several outlying towns.
 The over-all situation is
 further complicated by a bitter
 feud in Duvalier's family.   Part
 of the problem involves a dispute
 between Max Dominique and Duvalier's
 other son-in-law, Director of Tour-
 ism Luc Foucard.   In addition,
 Dominique's wife is reportedly so
 upset over the attentions Duvalier
 has been paying to his mistress
 that she has urged her husband to
 "take action" against Duvalier.
 These developments have probably
 raised Duvalier's suspicions about
 the possibility of a palace in-
 trigue involving members of his
 own family.

 ECUADOR PROMULGATES NEW CONSTITUTION
 After nearly seven months
 of deliberation, Ecuador's 79-
 man constituent assembly has
 completed work on the country's
 new constitution--its 17th since
 1830.   Interim President Otto
 Arosemena formally promulgated
 the document on 29 May.
 In general,  the new consti-
 tution appears to be an improve-
 ment over the last one in terms
 of political reality and social
 justice.   It includes provision
 for a bicameral legislature of
 54 senators and 65 deputies;
 for "permanence" of this consti-
 tution regardless of possible
 interruption of constitutional
 rule;  and for congressional
 power to interpret and amend the
 constitution.
 The president of the repub-
 lic is to be elected on the first
 Sunday of June every four years.
 Former presidents are eligible
 for re-election, but a president
 cannot succeed himself.   Otto
 Arosemena's eligibility, however,
 is open for interpretation since
 he was elected indirectly by the
 assembly.   Arosemena says that
 he cannot be a candidate for
 president in the June 1968
 general elections, but consti-
 tutional lawyers have pointed
 SECRET
 Page  25    WEEKLY SUMMARY
 out that he would be eligible
 if he resigned six months be-
 fore the election date.
 The constituent assembly
 will dissolve itself within
 the next two weeks now that its
 primary task is completed.   It
 will reconvene in November as
 an extraordinary congress,
 however, to approve the 1968
 budget and revised electoral
 law.   The demise of the assembly,
 which had also been acting as
 a unicameral legislature, will
 deprive opportunistic politi-
 cians of a ready forum for their
 views, but it will also mean
 that Arosemena's government will
 bear the full brunt of popular
 discontent.   Heretofore, some
 of the dissatisfaction was
 channeled to the assembly.
 Arosemena is expected to
 make some changes in his cabinet
 once the assembly adjourns.
 Some new ministers,
 inc uding the foreign minister,
 will probably be appointed, but
 most of the incumbents will
 probably stay on.

 BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT-STUDENT RELATIONS REMAIN TOUCHY
 The Brazilian Government
 has thus far failed to find any
 effective means for coping with
 persistent student unrest.   Con-
 tinued antiregime protests in
 the universities and secondary
 schools seem likely.
 Demonstrations have occurred
 in most major cities.   In Rio de
 Janeiro and Recife last week
 student agitators were able--to
 some degree--to turn protests
 over legitimate grievances into
 displays of antigovernment,  anti-
 US sentiment.   Although security
 forces exercised considerable re-
 straint,  a few injuries resulted
 and were exploited by the press
 and some opposition politicians.
 President Costa e Silva
 and Education Minister Dutra
 reportedly are convinced that
 students are merely testing the
 new government.   They do not want
 to hand the students a potentially
 explosive issue by adopting strong
 measures.   Dutra hopes the state
 governments will be able to
 handle student problems and prefers
 to reserve federal intervention
 as a last resort.   Top military
 leaders reportedly opposed this
 policy, however,  and have counseled
 the President to issue a strict
 decree governing student demonstra-
 tions and strikes.   They urge the
 use of federal police or,  if nec-
 essary,  troops to enforce the
 decree.   Security officials fear
 that a permissive policy will only
 encourage increasingly radical
 demonstrations and. could eventu-
 ally cause the government to
 react with undue force.
 Government bids to establish
 a dialogue with the students have
 failed dismally.   The National
 Students'  Directory  (DNE)  which
 was organized under former Pres-
 ident Castello Branco, was so
 unpopular that it was abolished
 in February 1967.   Recently,
 the Education Ministry clandes-
 tinely financed a regional stu-
 dent seminar under the direction
 of student leaders, who were active
 in the DNE.   The government hoped
 that the seminar would launch a
 new student organization repre-
 senting the "democratic" student
 movement.   Word of the govern-
 ment's backing leaked out, however,
 and many students boycotted the
 meetings or walked out before
 the seminar ended.
 Most Brazilian students con-
 sider the DNE and its leaders gov-
 ernment "stooges" and continue to
 support the extremist-dominated
 National Students Union, which
 is still operating,  although
 illegally.   The Government's efforts
 to displace radical student organ-
 izations are not likely to be
 successful unless it demonstrates
 a willingness to take action to
 correct student grievances and
 to accept legitimate student po-
 litical activity,

 PERUVIAN POLITICAL CRISIS AVERTED
 An eleventh-hour compromise
 has at least temporarily postponed
 a major confrontation between the
 Belaunde administration and Peru's
 oppositon-controlled Congress.
 The administration has backed
 away from its demands for new tax
 authority to deal with a fiscal
 crisis stemming from declining
 export revenues,  a rapid growth
 of imports,  and a rate of govern-
 ment spending which exceeds the
 revenues from the narrow Peruvian
 tax base.
 The refusal of the military
 to be drawn into the executive-
 legislative struggle and rumors
 of military concern over the de-
 veloping political stalemate ap-
 parently led the government to
 accept the opposition alternative
 proposals for handling the crisis.
 These proposals included cutting
 government expenditures,  tighten-
 ing expenditure controls,  and
 revising import duties.   The new
 agreement shelved plans for a
 wide range of taxes which would
 have fallen primarily on the
 working classes--a major bastion
 of political strength for the
 largest opposition party, APRA.
 Although it is not yet known
 whether the agreement will signi-
 ficantly reduce the budget defi-
 cit of nearly $200 million--a
 threefold increase over 1966--the
 administration's backdown has
 calmed political tensions.   These
 may be revived, however, when
 the executive reports to Congress
 within 30 days on specific cuts
 in proposed expenditures for 1967.
 The fourth special session of
 Congress begins on 5 June and is
 expected to last until late July.
