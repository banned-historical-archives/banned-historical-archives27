MINCRANDUM Fat TER ASSISTANT DMRCTOR PCB OPERATIOBS 
SWIM Overall Requirements for Propaganda Analysis 
1. In response to your request this office has prepared the 
attached study of Soviet Bloc intelligence requirements. It would 
be highly useful to have thorough propagenda analysis on these sub. 
jects in support of national intelligence estimates. The list is, 
of course, illustrative rather than exhsustive and covers only the 
key areas of the Bloc. Moreover, it was prepared from the point or 
view of a consumer, and we recognise that some of the subjects might 
not, at least in their present form, be suitable for promanda 
analysis. We are snare that it requires a trained propaganda analyst1 
to ascertain which topics can be most fruitfully studied. Finally, 
we believe that promplumihismolysis operations need not be limited to 
meeting such external requirements but should be a continuing element 
in the intelligence process, independently analysing Bloc mass corn. 
nunications, and constantly providing to consumers like 0/0 a self-
initiated flow or analyses. 
i2. The wide use by the entire intelligence coneuntty of the 
existing FBID monitoring or Soviet propaganda is ample indication of 
the unquestioned value of this source in giving us insights into de-
velopmeats behind the Curtain. We believe, however, that the value 
of this great mass of descriptive raw material is greatly enhanced 
when analysed by experts and put into more finished form. The props-
)pada analyses which have been done by 0001311 Ps small analysis unit 
have been extremely useful In the /reparation of SM.. Cases in point 
are studies done for us on. Albania, Yugoslavia, Nast Germany, etc. 
The very value or these studies convinces us that this source should 
be more fully tapped. In our opinion propagenda analysis can turn a 
i Soviet weapon -- their promo's& .- into a potent intelligence tool, 
one all the the more urgently needed because the Soviet security systole 
makes au intelligence data on this critical area so hard to come by-
and so sparse.

3. In our list of requirements we have sought to provide FWD 
and FDD with the guidance necessary to focus their attention on current 
and future problems of concern to the rest of the intelligence com-
munity. Norever, we believe that FBID should also be provided with 
the moos to okra out retrospective studies designed to produce those 
necessary background generalisations on Soviet propaganda behavior 
which are essential to sound current analysis. For example, the im-
plicit generalisations upon which are based the conclusions of such 
excellent studies as The Great Stalin Projects, and Nu_clearin 
Soviet Frovspnda should be susceptible of further tat5i7i5d-iiRde-
ment. The e of such studies is a, major weakness which limits 
the ability of propaganda analysis to provide sharp and coherent inter-
pretations. Therefore, we have included suggestions for such studies 
in our requirements in the hope that FEID will be able, either itself 
or through external research, to devote an increasing effort to building 
up this indispensable background material. 
k. In presenting these requirements we are aware that many of 
them are already being partially met, insofar as resources permit, by 
MID. We are also aware that every intelligence analyst on the Soviet 
Bloc (in ONE, 0/CI, OIR, 0-2, etc.) is himself doing some degree of 
propaganda analysis as part of his daily work. We believe, however, 
(that the BAND studies and ethers have demonstrated conclusively that 
the best propaganda analysis nust be done by trained experts with a 
backlog of experience and with constant and ready access to all the 
background studies and raw materials. In our opinion this can be done 
effectively only by units such as 00/7EI1) and F.

Fan PROPAGANDA ANALYSIS 
I. reameenee e IS ON SMUT Turman AFFAIRS 
( 
Intelligence interest is focused upon the degree of control enjoyed by 
the ruling group and on the domestic ;policies pursued by them insofar 
as theee policies have a bearing on Soviet capabilities or intentions. 
We believe light can be thrown upon these problems by answers to the 
following qeestions: 
1. What evidence is there in current Soviet propaganda theme (e. g. 
the emphasis on consumer-goods production, the reliance on material 
self-interest as a stimulus for worker productivity, the avoidance 
of fear techniques) that a decision has been reached to relax the 
tension that marked the Stalinist period, to reduce the tempo of 
forced industrialization and to return to the normalcy of a more 
conservative pace of economic activity? 
2. What evidence is there that the regime has changed its trelitional 
attitudes toward divorce, thrift, family pride, crime, eta.? What 
are the trends? 
3. Is the new regime adopting a policy of reassurance toward the of-
ficial and managerial class indicating an abandonment by it of the 
fear-Inspiring personnel policy of Stalin and a decision to paws 
its Nave' on the sturdy and the strong"? 
4. Does there appear to be an appreciable change in the Amount and 
content of self-criticism indulged in by the elite journels under 
the meerregime an compared with the old? Are the targets of self-
Oriticiam being restricted or expended? 
5. Stalin's nest writings offer a glimpse of the movement of ideas 
going on in the Soviet ruling circles behind the facade of uni-
formity. What light can propaganda analysis throw upon the problem 
of elitist factionalian the competition of "schools" of thought, 
and the relevance of this phencomneet to the formulation of policy? 
A careful study Of theoretical writings in economic journels from 
the period of the Varga controversy to Stalin's article might pro-
vide an opening wedge into this problem.

4S ON SOVIET FEIGN POLICY 
Intelligence interest is focused upon the extent to which any change 
has been or maybe effected in Soviet foreign policy aims and foreign 
policy techniqumeby the Nalenkav regime. From the point of view of 
immediate Interest, indications of change with respect to current 
areas at issue, e. g., Germagy, Austria, Korea, Indo-China, are de... 
sired. him the long-rango point of view, indications of the abate.. 
meat of aggressive intentions, of the extension of the time table of 
revolution, of a greater flexibility and adventurousness, eta., are 
equally desired. 
1. Does there appear to be any willingness on the part of Kremlin 
leaders to ailment a more precarious situation of control in 
Eastern Germany in exchange for a possible softening of Western 
solidarity? 
2. Can any light be thrown an possible changes in policy since 
Stalir's time by a careful comparison of present and past policies 
in specific areas, e. g., TUgoslavia, Iran, Turkey? nil a col-
lation with the events of the world political scene Illuminate 
the extent to which any such changes reflect a new approach to 
polities, a new lightness of touch, or reflect merely an adaptation 
of old policies to changed conditions? 
3. Is it possible to develop techniques of analysis to provide In-
ferences regarding the respective roles rived in the formulation 
of policy by such factors as: (a) historical or traditional 
Russian objectives; (b) the desire of leaders to ?Ontario and 
consolidate their personal power positions; (c) ideological 
motives; (d) considerations of national security? 
4 What light can propaganda analysis throw on the Soviet concept of 
"national security"? Do the Kremlin leaders conceive of it to 
consist primarily in the consolidrtion of their territorial and 
power base, or do they conceive of it in more relative terms as 
consisting in the manipulation of the balance of power and the 
undermining of the strength of the free world? 
What is the Soviet estimate of US intentions? For example, does 
the Soviet leadership really attribute aggressive intentions to 
NATO, to the US base polio,/ If eo, especially with respect to 
the latter, does the Soviet leadership believe the threat an im-
minent one?

1. The character of the Satellite populations, their possession 
of independent standards of criticism, their memories of 
freedom, etc., present problems for the Satellite propagandist 
which are not present in the USSR itself. If, as a conse-
quence, Satellite propagable is more oriented toward combatting 
such incipient sources of discontent, an analysis of their 
output may provide valuable evidence on: 
a. The state of popular morale (For example, do reassurance 
themes regarding agricultural dislocation, living 
standards, etc., provide insights on this problem?) 
Ix The attitudes of the ropolation and/or elites with re. 
'peat to their relationship with Moscow. To what extent 
do the attitudes of the Satellite populations have to be 
taken into account by the local regimes in determining 
how far they can go in cutting them off from the outside 
world? Do these attitudes constitute a restraint in any 
way upon Soviet actions in the Satellites?

what has been the reaction of the Satellite populations 
toward the West? To what extent do influential groups

espousal by the West of non-recognition of permanent 
Soviet control of the Satellites? 
2. In what important respects does Soviet policy toward indi-
vidual Satellite countries differ from Soviet policy toward 
the Satellites as a whole? For =ample, how do the Comma-
mists amount for the continuation of personalized power in 
some Satellites, while others, e. g.? Czechoslovakia and 
Hungary, have adopted the principle of collective leader.

populations and armed forces in the event of war?

c. What evidence can propaganda analysis provide on the 
problem of Sino-Soviet foreign policy coordination, and

are there evidences of lack of coordination in propaganda 
treatment of policy moves, as, in the past, the invasion 
of Korea in june 1950 and the UN Menon Resolution episode, 
November - Deeember 1952? Is there evidence bearing an 
whether either partner appeared, or appears, more .anxious 
that the Korean war be closed out, or that a Korean po-

1. Are there indications of change in strategic military planning? An 
examination of all media focused on the significance, with respect 
to war planning, of the resent shifts of the Soviet command may 
help to illuminate the tenor of present strategic thinking. Spe-
cifically, does it appear that the Soviet oommand emphasises de-
fense, retaliation, or aggression? 
2, While our intelligence on Soviet troops stationed on the periphery 
of the Bloc is relatively good, we know very little about the ef-
fectiveness and morale of divisions in the interior. Will an 
analysis of propaganda directed to the troops in the interim, 
similar to the radio Volga analyses, throw light on this problem?

3. What are Soviet attitudes toward the rearmament of Germany? We are 
not interested here in Soviet state policy, but in psychological 
attitudes. Does the historic dread of Gernan military night still 
prevail, or has the experience of victory in World War II buoyed 
up Russian confidence to the extent of permitting them a freer and 
more adventurous policy in Europe? What inferences, bearing on 
this problem, are permissable from commentaries such as the 19 De. 
camber 1953 talk by Frankenhurg? 
A. What is the effect of nuclear weapons upon Soviet military planning? 
What does Soviet propaganda output indicate with respect to the 
state of Soviet nuclear develo.-.nt (cf. the Nazi propaganda about 
secret weapons in World War II ? What does it indicate with re-
spect to Soviet concern over nuclear warfare? What is the propa-
ganda practice? What significance may we attach to changes in 
practice? 
5. How does the USSR estimate the deterrent power of NATO? US ground 
forces in Europe? US air power? 
6. Are there any new doctrinal comments upon the role of war as an in-
strument for the attainment of Communist objectives? 
7, What is the Soviet estimate of the relative ability and resolution 
of the West and of the Bloc to wage a global war? To intervene in 
local wars? To endure a war of long duration? To undertake an 
atonic war? 
8. To what extent does Soviet propaganda stress the need for civil de-
fense training, etc.? What does this indicate with respect to 
Soviet concern over the imminence of war? Over the threat of US 
air attack? 
V. INSTRUMENTAL STUDIES AND GENERALIZATION PRODUCING RESEARCH 
We recognize that no one can predict ahead of time what generalizations 
about Soviet propaganda behavior are going to look like, and we are 
persuaded that only those who continually handle propaganda material 
are in a position to set useful problems for testing. The instrumental 
studies which we propose here therefore have in most cases been provided 
for us by the analysts of FBID or been approved by them as feasible 
projects for study.

1. What is the pattern of the evolution of global propaganda compaigns? 
2. What is Radio MOseow's audience? There is evidence that at various 
times it is taking to the masses, to the Western elite, to the 
burgeoisie, to the left intelligentsia, to party workers, to party 
elite (at home and abroad). 
3. What are the typical responses to major Western initiatives? (Note 
the similar patterns of response to Eisenhower in April, to Churchill 
in May, to Eisenhower in Decanter.) 
A.. What importance should be attached to the identities of commentators? 
Who introduces the lines? Do some get special briefings, have spsoial 
subjects, etc.? 
5. What is the allocation of propaganda functions in the Bloc? What is 
the allocation of functions in comment on new developments? What are 
the differences, contradictions, anticipations? 
6. What are the characteristic tactics in offsetting propaganda defeats, 
embarrassments (e.g., Soviet withdrawal from Iran, the Tito defection, 
the aggression against Czechoslovakia, the Greek guerrilla defeat, 
the Olympics fiasco, the 'Satin Forest investigation, the Berlin air-
lift, election defeats, etc.). Various patterns may emerge which will 
gauge the Soviet estimate of the character and degree of defeat. 
7. What are the typical propaganda techniques? When and why do they 
use silence, avoidance, counter-attack, and diversion? 
S. To what extent does Soviet propaganda directly reflect the estimates 
of the elite rather than, or in addition to, his propaganda tactics? 
While of extreme difficulty, even partial answers to this question 
woad have tremendous value. For example, the peace offensive fol-
lowing Stalin's death, the whole period from late December 1951 on 
with growing emphasis on disunity, the decline of aggression, the 
initiation of the East-West trade effort, and the German proposals 
in &roll might provide subjects for study bearing on this question. 
9. What evidence regarding Sino-Soviet relations can be developed by 
a study of Mbecowle Mandarin beam? For example, textual compari-
sons to identify and verify evasions, sensitivities, etc., may 
throw light on this problem.

10. What generalisations can be developed regarding war time Soviet 
propaganda behavior? What are the characteristic patterns of re-
sponse to stress, etc.? 
11. What generalisations can be developed by a detailed historical 
study of the Nasi-Saviet Pact (Where we have the highest capability 
in view of the German documents)? Comparison of overt propaganda 
with hidden policy shifts would probably provide spocific keys and 
general insights on the connection and confluence of propaganda 
with political policy and estimates. 
12. What generalisations can be developed bye systematic study of other 
first-hand insights into Soviet modes of operation, e. g., Itgoslav 
observations, Western contacts with Stalin, and others during the 
wars defector reports, etc.? 
13. What generalisations can be developed bye. retrospective study of 
all previous analyses for the prrpose of extracting implicit and 
explicit generalisations for continuous testing? 
14. Vbat generalizations can be developed by a study of the relationship 
of elite to maps communications? The Soviet-Chinese treatment of 
Mao might provide a case study to illuminate this general problem 
area.
