 DCI BRIEFING FOR
 JOINT ECONOMIC COMMITTEE
 24 May 19 76
 INTRODUCTION
 I. Mr. Chairman, it is a pleasure to be here this
 morning.   i am glad to be following precedent
 of discussing with the subcommittee the economies
 of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of
 China.
 I am also pleased to note that in the eleven
 months since Mr. Colby last appeared here,
 CIA analysts have continued to contribute
 substantially to the highly useful products
 sponsored by this committee.   I understand
 that this practice began some 15 years ago,
 when the Agency first contributed to the Com-
 mittee's annual compendium of papers on the
 Soviet and Chinese economies.  I welcome
 this opportunity to make the results of our
 analytical efforts available on an unclassified
 basis, to scholars and government components
 outside the intelligence community.

 1.   In that connection, I have been pleased
 to learn that the Agency has followed
 the practice of providing your committee
 with each unclassified study concerning
 the Soviet and Chinese economies as
 they are completed, and that members
 of your staff have received occasional
 briefing on these subjects.
 B.   At this point, Mr. Chairman, I would like
 to make a few general observations on the
 two major economies and their allocation
 of resources, and then speak on the special
 matter of the refiguring of Soviet defense
 spending on the basis of rubles.
 II.   First, let me highlight a few features of cur-
 rent Soviet economic trends.
 A.   In 1975 the Soviet economy suffered its most
 serious setback since Brezhnev came to power.
 For agriculture, the year was disastrous.
 And in trade, the combination of increased
 grain imports and sluggish Western demand
 for Soviet exports led to a record hard cur-
 rency trade deficit.

 Approved For Release 2004/01/20 : CIA-RDP83MOOl71 R001100010011-3
 B.  Last year's troubles will hurt the economy's
 performance this year.
 1.    We are getting reports of food shortages,
 particularly of meat, as well as stories
 of work slow-downs and vandalism in the
 markets, as the people vent their ire.
 2.    People are grumbling, but this is not
 likely to pose problems of public order
 that the regime cannot cope with.
 C.   In planning for 1976, the Soviets have had
 to cut back their targets to allow for in-
 evitable shortages of farm products.   Ap-
 parently some prospective contracts for
 Western technology and equipment have also
 been shelved, possibly because of the hard-
 currency bind.
 1.   The 1976 plan embodies relatively mod-
 erate goals, which we consider to be
 generally attainable.
 D.    Similarly, the basic guidelines of the So-
 viets'  10th Five-Year Plan, which begins
 this year, are generally much like those of
 the last one, though they set more modest
 goals. They reflect the restrained ap-
 proach of Brezhnev's leadership over the

 Approved For Release 2004/01/20 : CIA-RDP83MOOl71 R001100010011-3
 past 10 years.   He has taken no steps to
 make bold, innovative changes in the eco-
 nomic system.
 E.   As you will hear soon, Mr. Chairman, we see
 many signs that the Soviet economy has en-
 tered a period of slower growth, at a
 time when all major sectors -- defense,
 industrial growth, and consumption --
 are demanding increases.   I would only
 underline that the leadership's handling
 of these issues is bound to be contentious,
 particularly when the old guard of the polit-
 buro will be passing from the scene.
 III.         In respect to China, Mr. Chairman, the picture
 is one of more impressive growth, but in a
 highly erratic overall pattern.
 A. As in the Soviet Union, agriculture has
 generally been a problem area.   The Chinese
 have been according an increasing share
 of resources to agriculture.   They also
 are having some success in stemming the
 growth of the population, now estimated
 to be about 950 million.

 B.   Second, I would remind you that the greatest
 disruptions in China's economic growth have
 closely matched periods of political turbu-
 lence -- the Great Leap Forward in the early
 1960s, the Cultural Revolution of the late
 60s, and the anti-Confucius campaign of two
 years ago.   So in trying to project economic
 trends into the future, we must provide a
 cautionary note in view of the sudden lead-
 ership changes in Peking this year.
 1.   Chou's death, the subsequent removal
 of Teng Hsiao-ping as acting premier,
 and the elevation of Hua Kuo-feng
 to the premiership last month took place
 in a period of political controversy
 that underlines the uncertainty sur-
 rounding future policies.   Attacks
 on Teng Hsiao-ping have raised specific
 economic issues.
 C.    Nevertheless, Chinese awareness of the
 close connection between success in eco-
 nomic development and political stability
 perhaps explains why -- during the strug-
 gle to oust Teng Hsiao-ping -- careful at-
 tention was given to emphasizing that nothing

 SECRET
 Approved For Release 2004/01/20 : CIA-RDP83MOOl71 R001100010011-3
 should interfere with production or other
 operations in the economy.
 1.   The situation is obviously still fluid.
 Chou's death and Chairman Mao's physi-
 cal decline have ushered in a period of
 political turbulence which may become
 intensified upon Mao's death.   Past
 experience suggests that such turmoil
 might cause marked disturbances in the
 economy as well.
 IV.   My final comments, Mr. Chairman, concern
 your committee's special interest in Moscow's
 allocation of resources to military and
 space functions, especially as figured in
 the Soviets' own budgets, that is, in rubles.

 B.   Applying our building block methodology to
 this new information, we have of course
 changed our estimates.   Some of these changes
 seem quite startling, at first glance at
 least.
 1.   For my part, Mr. Chairman, I just
 want to say how impressed I am with
 the intelligence community's constant
 re-examining of old judgments in the
 light of the unceasing flow of new
 information.
 C.   Also, I must add my own words of caution
 on the dangers of magnifying the signifi-
 cance of any of these figures in themselves,
 whether in dollars or in rubles.  At most,
 they offer some elucidation of trends,
 relative internal priorities, and general
 order of magnitude.
 D.    It is also important not to misunderstand
 the significance of the new estimate of the
 share of Soviet GNP devoted to defense, as
 expressed in rubles.   It does not signify
 a dramatic jump in the size of Soviet defense

 programs.   It does reflect an increase in our
 assessment of the cost of those programs.
 V.   Mr. Chairman, we appreciate testifying in closed
 session so that we may answer your questions without
 the inhibiting effects of concern for protection
 of sources and methods.  We will later review the
 transcript to remove any classified information
 with the aim of permitting the publication of as
 much of our testimony as possible.

 PART I:   THE SOVIET ECONOMY
 Results in 1975
 I.   Mr. Chairman, I would like to expand on the So-
 viet economic situation in 1975-76 and on likely
 developments during the remainder of the decade.
 A.   Last year the growth of Soviet gross national
 product slumped to about 2 1/2 percent compared
 with the 4 percent annual average rate in 1971-74.
 (Chart:   US-USSR:   GNP)
 1.  The miserable grain harvest -- output
 was only 140 million tons compared with
 a plan of 216 million tons -- pulled total
 agricultural output down by 9 percent.
 Since agriculture represents roughly one-
 fifth of GNP, this drop clearly was the
 major factor in last year's decline in
 the rate of overall growth.
 2.   Moscow took a number of steps to lower
 the demand for grain:
 a.   Livestock was fed substitutes such
 as reeds and leaves, and in some
 cases actually moved out of the
 drought-afflicted areas;

 SECRET
 Approved For Release 2004/0 W.-MARDP83M00171 R001 100010011-3
 b.   All grain export commitments to East-
 ern Europe were canceled.  These had
 been running at about 7 million tons
 annually.
 3.   At the same time, grain reserve stocks
 were drawn on heavily -- to what we be-
 lieve are now minimal levels -- and Mos-
 cow arranged large-scale grain imports.
 a.   Including the most recent deals with
 Canada, Australia, and the US, we
 calculate the Soviets have purchased
 about 37 million tons since July, in-
 cluding 19 million tons from us.
 4.   Despite all these measures, feed supplies
 in the USSR have been inadequate. Distress
 slaughtering began as early as last sum-
 mer, and by yearend, inventories of hogs
 and poultry -- the two principal grain
 consumers -- were down by 20 percent and
 15 percent respectively.
 a.   This meant a short-term rise in meat,
 but at the expense of future supplies.
 Both the quantity and quality of meat
 evidently have already turned down.

 Approved For Release 2004/0?W"M9DP83M00171R001100010011-3
 We estimate that the Soviet consumer
 will get 25 percent less meat this
 year than last.
 B.   Soviet industrial output was about normal in
 1975.   It grew by 6 1/2 percent, in line with
 average over the past five years.   (Chart:   US-
 USSR:                                      Industrial Growth)
 1.   The production of industrial raw materials
 grew impressively, chemicals being the
 star performer.
 2.   The output of consumer goods grew less
 than in the past.
 3.   Producer durables also fell off.
 4.   And the production of primary energy
 continued to move up steadily, reflect-
 ing the USSR's unique position of energy
 self-sufficiency among the world's in-
 dustrialized powers.   (Charts:   US-USSR:
 Primary Energy,  1975; USSR:   Oil and
 Natural Gas Production and Trade) Even
 though the Soviets face difficult prob-
 lems in developing petroleum fields in
 distant and inhospitable areas, it is

 only a question of time before these ex-
 tensive reserves come on stream.
 5.   Steel output was at a record level, but
 demand still outran domestic supply, so
 imports continued to be high.   (Chart:
 Crude Steel Production in Major Countries)
 6.   As for machinery, technologically advanced
 items, and equipment for the agricul-
 tural sector led the way.
 a.  Dramatic rates of increase -- such
 as 32 percent for computer equip-
 ment -- were possible because output
 in 1974 was low compared with levels
 in other industrialized countries.
 The USSR is now concentrating on a
 computer series modelled on the tech-
 nology of the IBM 360 line, which was
 developed here in the early 1960s.
 C.   In the area of capital investment, the Soviets
 last year continued to devote a high propor-
 tion of GNP -- one-fourth compared to about
 one-sixth in the US -- to expanding the stock
 of new plant and equipment.

 D.   All in all, the Soviet consumer had a rela-
 tively good year in 1975, despite the worsen-
 ing agricultural situation.   The food marketing
 pipeline remained full, aided by distress
 slaughtering, and other consumer goods and
 services were more available than before.
 (Charts:   US-USSR:   Composition of Diets,
 1974;  US-USSR:   Per Capita Consumption,  1974)
 1.  On a less positive note, the increase
 in average wages was kept down again
 last year to restrain inflationary pres-
 sures; savings bank deposits rose again
 until they are now equivalent to more
 than one-third of total money incomes.
 2.   The total supply of new housing edged
 up, but living space -- on a per capita
 basis -- remains below even Soviet norms.
 E.   Soviet foreign trade continued to rise last
 year. Its value, measured in dollars, grew
 by an impressive 35-percent; on a volume
 basis we estimate the rise to be well under
 half of this rate of increase.
 1.   The rapid rise in imports from the de-
 veloped West  (including Japan)  plus a

 Approved For Release 2004/(8BC  ]OTDP83M00171 R001 100010011-3
 drop in demand in the West has resulted
 in hard-currency deficits in recent years.
 (Chart:   USSR:   Hard-Currency Merchandise
 Trade)   Last year, with recession in the
 West cutting demand still further, the
 foreign-exchange position deteriorated
 dramatically.  The USSR had a roughly
 $5 billion hard currency trade deficit
 compared with a $900 million deficit in
 1974.
 a.   This occurred despite a further rise
 in the share of high-priced oil and
 oil products in Soviet exports.   (Chart:
 USSR:   OiZ Share of Hard Currency Exports)
 b.   The Soviets finance their large and
 escalating hard-currency trade deficits
 through a combination of credits and
 gold sales.  With the conspicuous ex-
 ception of the US, since mid-1974 West-
 ern governments have extended or backed
 more than $11 billion in long-term
 credits to finance Soviet purchases
 of machinery and equipment.

 Approved For Release 2004/0`11'2P9TDP83M00171 R001 100010011-3
 C.   Although the USSR's medium and long-
 term debt rose rapidly last year to
 at least $7 billion, debt service re-
 mains manageable, as it accounted for
 only about one fifth of Moscow's hard-
 currency earnings in 1975.
 d.    While the Soviets are concerned, they
 still purchased last year  more than
 $4 billion in Western technology and
 equipment for future delivery.
 Soviet Economic Aid to LDCs
 F.  You are interested, Mr. Chairman, in how the
 Soviet economic aid program fared in these cir-
 cumstances.   Deliveries to LDCs last year were
 about $400 million, the 1970-73 average, down
 by one third from the unusually high 1974
 figure swollen by emergency wheat shipments
 to India.
 1.   As before,  the Near East and South Asia
 received the lion's share.   Egypt, Iran,
 India, Turkey, and Iraq alone accounted
 for more than 70 percent of total aid de-
 liveries.

 2.   New commitments were up sharply, to a
 record $1.3 billion.   They included Mos-
 cow's largest credits ever extended to
 LDCs -- $437 million to Afghanistan and
 $650 million to Turkey.
 3.   We expect the Soviets to maintain recent
 delivery levels in 1976 despite the pos-
 sibility that Egypt will begin to phase
 out the Soviet program.   Expanded de-
 liveries to other Near East and South
 Asian countries should make up the short-
 fall.
 The Outlook for 1976
 II.  Turning now to the Soviet economic plan for
 1976, one is immediately struck by the gen-
 erally low and fairly realistic goals pro-
 jected -- with the possible exception of agri-
 culture.   Clearly the Kremlin recognizes that
 last year's harvest failure will have substan-
 tial carryover effects.   (Chart:   USSR:   Growth
 of GNP, by Sector of Origin)
 A.   The consumer will be hardest hit; growth
 of industrial production also will be
 slowed,  and the Soviets will continue to

 carry a sizable hard-currency trade defi-
 cit.   GNP as a whole is planned to in-
 crease by about 4 1/2 percent (up from
 the estimated 1975 rate of 2 1/2 percent).
 B.   The projected increase in industrial output
 of 4 1/2 percent is the lowest planned for
 since World War II.
 1.   This low target reflects anticipated
 shortages of agricultural raw materials
 and continuing lags in bringing new
 plant and equipment on stream.
 2.   Targets for both heavy and light indus-
 try are down by historical standards,
 but heavy industry retains preference,
 as usual.
 C.    Growth in total investment is to be halved,
 to about 4 percent.
 1.   Once again the plan places major em-
 phasis on completing unfinished invest-
 ment projects and modernizing existing
 plant and equipment.
 2.   Agriculture and its supporting indus-
 tries are to maintain their priority

 Approved For Release 2004/0SC'DP83M00171R001100010011-3
 status, receiving more than one third
 of total investment.
 D.   Among the many ingredients in the plans,
 the most questionable is agriculture, which
 is scheduled to rebound, from a 9 percent
 decline in 1975 to a 9 percent growth this
 year.   With grain stocks down and livestock
 herds reduced, the agricultural situation
 seems bound to remain precarious.
 1. Achievement of the ambitious agricul-
 tural output goal is crucially de-
 pendent on above-average weather during
 the rest of the growing and harvesting
 seasons.
 a.        We believe that winterkill of winter
 grains planted last fall was higher
 than normal.   These grains generally
 account for one third of Soviet
 grain harvests.
 b.      Soil moisture conditions for spring
 grains, which will be planted this
 month, have been improving steadily,
 but are still not good following
 last year's drought.

 E.   In the area of consumer welfare, the Soviet
 populace this year faces the prospects of
 the smallest gains in the Brezhnev era.
 1.   The rate of increase in per capita real
 income will decline from the 1974-75
 level, and the rise in the average
 wage for workers will be held below
 3 percent.   Both indicators reflect
 the limited prospects for increased
 supplies of consumer goods and ser-
 vices, as well as the leadership's
 determination to restrain inflationary
 pressure.
 2.   Probably the most serious problem af-
 fecting the Soviet consumer this year
 is the anticipated one-fourth dro  in
 per capita meat consumption.   This
 will return the populace to the level
 of the late 1960s.
 a.   Despite gains during the past decade,
 the average Soviet citizen still
 eats only two fifths as much meat
 as his US counterpart and three
 fourths as much as the average Pole
 or Hungarian.

 Approved For Release 2004/c 4P      DP83M00171 R001 100010011-3
 b.    As meat supplies are relatively
 abundant on the world market, we
 expect that the Soviets will import
 meat products this year.  They
 could buy as much as a million
 tons -- their logistical limit --
 which would raise per capita supply
 by about 10 percent; this would also
 add another 1 billion dollars to their
 already large import bill.
 F.   The 1976 plan calls for a rise of 13 1/2
 percent in the value of foreign trade, a
 rate that probably will be exceeded by a
 wide margin based on past experience and
 the likelihood of continued inflation.
 1.   In their hard-currency trade, the
 Soviets probably will run a deficit
 on the order of 3-5 billion dollars.
 2.   The 1976 import picture is fairly
 clear.   Imports from the West will
 continue to rise under the $8 billion
 in contracts for plant, and equipment

 signed in 1974-75, and the grain
 bill will be at least 2 billion dollars.
 3.  On the export side, Soviet prospects
 depend primarily on the degree and
 pace of recovery in the West.
 4.  To finance the deficit, the Soviets
 will continue to resort to both credits
 and gold sales.   As a result, they will
 end 1976 with an external debt substan-
 tially higher than at yearend 1975,. but
 one that will still be within manage-
 able limits.
 The New Five-Year Plan
 III.    I will conclude this section, Mr. Chairman, with
 some comment on the Five-Year Plan for 1976-80,
 and then a few general observations.
 A.   The USSR is starting the new plan period
 on an inauspicious note, with the conse-
 quences of the 1975 crop failure being
 felt strongly this year.
 1.   The new plan presumably was in fairly
 firm shape, at least in its basic
 guidelines, before last year's drought
 - 13 -
 Approved For Release 2004/01/20 : CIA-RDP83M00l71 R001100010011-3
 SECRET
 Approved For Release 2004/O'YW.-RDP83M00171R001100010011-3
 occurred.   Consequently, the planners
 must have had to do some serious re-
 drafting in the last half of 1975.
 2.   In the process they apparently opted for
 realism and moderation in setting goals.
 They seem to have largely avoided the
 taut and overambitious plans tradi-
 tionally preferred by the Kremlin.
 The 1976-80 targets imply a GNP growth
 of 5 percent on an average annual basis --
 somewhat lower than what was actually achieved
 in the 1960s.   It is also lower than it first
 appears because it is calculated against a
 somewhat depressed 1975 base.
 C.   In brief, the guidelines are as follows:
 1.   Agriculture will continue to receive
 an unusually large share. of the country's
 total investment despite -- or perhaps
 because of -- this sector's disappointing
 development record;
 2.   Growth in industry and construction is to
 feature gains in productivity and improve-
 ment in quality rather than brute force
 increases obtained through greater in-
 puts of labor and capital.   As you know,
 Approved For Release 2004105/     I   DP83M00171 ROO1100010011-3
 Approved For Release 2004/(8$Qji]B'-PDP83M00171R001100010011-3
 Mr. Chairman, this is a very old, al-
 most wistful, theme in Soviet economic
 planning;
 3.   Under the plan the consumer is to hold
 his own compared with other resource
 claimants ;
 4.   We believe that long-term growth in
 military spending will continue for the
 next few years, albeit perhaps at a more
 moderate pace.   I will treat this spe-
 cial subject a bit later.
 5.   Trade with the West will increase in
 volume and in overall importance to
 the economy; this trade continues to'
 play an essential role in Soviet moderni-
 zation efforts.
 D.   Let us look at industrial plans first.   In-
 dustry is expected to continue its same
 steady rate of expansion as in the 1960s,
 at an average annual rate of 6 1/2 percent.
 The Soviets place even greater emphasis on
 higher quality of output and on the in-
 creased application of advanced technology.

 1.   Machinery output -- the source of equip-
 ment investment, military hardware, and
 consumer durables -- is slated to grow
 at 9.2 percent annually, well above
 the 8 percent rate achieved during
 the first half of the decade.
 2.   This high projection reflects the in-
 tention to raise the share of investment
 funds spent on equipment rather than on
 the construction of new facilities.
 E.        Agricultural growth is to be substantially
 higher than normally scheduled -- an average
 of 5 1/2 percent, but this is against the
 low 1975 base.
 1. The increase depends heavily on achieve-
 ment of the grain harvest target of
 215-220 million tons per year for
 the next five years.   Except in 1973,
 when the harvest reached a record 222.5
 million tons, the Soviet grain crop has
 always fallen well below this range.
 2.   Apparently the leadership believes the
 1975 downturn was an aberration unlikely

 to be repeated.   In contrast,-we con-
 clude that the frequency of weather-
 related crop shortfalls foreshadows
 unfavorable conditions in at least one --
 and perhaps two -- years out of the next
 five.
 F.   The rate set for new investment is unusually
 low:  As a result, the Soviets will be hard-
 pressed to maintain the traditional high
 rates of increase in their stock of new
 plant and equipment.
 1.   The most striking change is the slow
 growth projected for capital invest-
 ment -- 4 percent, or only three fifths
 of the growth actually achieved during
 the three preceding five-year plan
 periods.
 a.   The planners hope this reduction will
 force managers to use capital more
 judiciously -- by completing un-
 finished projects faster and by using
 of more technologically advanced
 machinery and equipment.

 b.   We are skeptical.   The Soviets have
 been down this road before.  While
 they have made some short-term gains,
 before long their planning and
 management system tends to undercut
 these initiatives.
 G.   As for the consumer, he can expect a moderate,
 if slower, increase in his living standards.
 The regime has told the populace that its
 interests will not be sacrificed unduly to
 achieve other economic goals.
 H.   In the area of foreign trade, the 5 to 6
 percent average growth rate planned for
 1976-80 is probably conservative, inas-
 much as actual trade has usually exceeded
 original targets.
 1.   Eastern Europe will remain the USSR's
 major trading partner, but the developed
 West have a somewhat larger share of
 total Soviet trade.
 a.   In buying from the West, the Soviets
 plan to concentrate on advanced
 equipment and technology; exports

 Approved For Release 2004/009P*A-RDP83M00171R001100010011-3
 to the West will again feature fuels
 and industrial raw materials.
 b.   Despite the recent rapid rise in
 Soviet hard-currency indebtedness,
 we.expect the USSR to continue the
 extensive use of Western credits
 in 1976-80.
 c.   The Soviet Union should be able to
 turn over its hard-currency obliga-
 tions without any real problems, as-
 suming (1) that Western governments
 remain willing to keep lending to
 Moscow and (2) there are no unusually
 severe or consecutive agricultural
 reverses.
 Prospects
 IV.   In the past we have characterized the Soviet economy
 as having great crude strength.   Growth has come
 more from the expansion of the number of units of
 labor and capital than from increases in the quality
 and efficiency of labor and capital.
 A.   The Soviet leadership has insisted upon a
 rapid rise in expenditure on new plant and
 equipment and has extracted as large a work

 El-
 Approved For Release 2004/0$9A-RDP83M00171R001100010011-3
 force as possible out of the populace.   These
 have been hard-core economic policies.
 B.   At the same time, the leadership has failed
 to close the productivity gap with the de-
 veloped West.   Measured in output per unit of
 capital and labor, productivity is only about
 one half that of the US.
 C.   Given this mixture of achievements and short-
 comings in mobilizing resources, the Soviet
 economy has demonstrated sufficient strength
 to do three things:  (a) provide adequate sup-
 port for an aggressive foreign policy and a
 formidable military posture,  (b)  slowly nar-
 row the production gap with the US, and (c)
 gradually raise the level of consumption of
 the Soviet people.
 D.   There are telling indications, however, that
 the Soviet economy will develop less rapidly
 than in the past.
 1.   The current slowdown in the flow of new
 investment will force the USSR to operate
 an industrial plant that is growing older
 and more obsolescent.
 2.   Annual increments to the labor force are

 Approved For Release 2004/0%%39DP83M00171R001100010011-3
 scheduled to slow markedly by the early
 1980s.
 3.   We doubt that the Soviet leaders will bene-
 fit as much from the application of new
 technology as they obviously desire.
 Party thinking opposes radical reform of
 the economic system involving decentrali-
 zation of decision-making and the intro-
 duction of effective financial incentives.
 E.   Intimately related to the outlook, of course,
 is the share of Soviet resources allocated to
 defense -- a subject I am about to discuss.
 Let me note now only that if the Kremlin con-
 tinues to allocate as great a share of-GNP to
 defense programs as it does now, it will be
 hard pressed to sustain the 4-1/2 percent
 average GNP growth rate achieved over the
 past decade.

 PART II:   SOVIET DEFENSE COSTS
 I. Mr. Chairman, I will now turn to the allocation
 of resources to military and space functions in
 the Soviet Union.  As you know, we completed
 our latest estimate of the dollar costs of re-
 producing Soviet military programs in the US in
 February.  We have also published, in the last
 week, a major revision of our estimate of Soviet
 ruble spending for defense.
 New Information
 A.   Before I review these estimates with you,
 I'd like to put them in context by discussing
 the new information and analysis which under-
 lies the revisions.   Some of our new data
 result from normal, annual revisions in our
 estimates of the size and characteristics of
 Soviet forces -- the building blocks which
 we use to construct our dollar and ruble es-
 timates.
 1.   For example, as a result of the latest
 round of National Intelligence Estimates
 the intelligence community has revised
 its figures on the production rate of
 the Backfire bomber and of some major

 ground force weapons such as the T-72
 tank and the BMP infantry combat vehicle.
 We also revised our estimates of the de-
 ployment rates of several strategic mis-
 siles and tactical aircraft.
 2.   In the spring of last year we completed
 a major interagency study of Soviet mili-
 tary manpower.   That study resulted in an
 upward revision of the estimated level of
 active military manpower, and an offsetting
 decrease in estimated civilian manpower.
 We also made some changes in the distribu-
 tion of manpower along the Soviet military
 services.
 3.   We also improved our knowledge of the tech-
 nical characteristics of Soviet weapons.
 25
 B.    As part of our continuing effort to improve our
 costing techniques, we conducted an extensive
 survey aimed at identifying aspects of Soviet
 military programs which were not explicitly
 Approved For Release 2004/0?f   R11P83M00171R001100010011-3
 SECRET
 Approved For Release 2004/01/20 : CIA-RDP83MOOl71 R001100010011-3
 accounted for in our previous estimates.
 1.   This year, we have included, for the first
 time, explicit estimates for Soviet prein-
 duction military training and utilities
 for military facilities.
 C.   We also made major improvements in.the past year
 in our methodologies for estimating the dollar
 costs of Soviet weapon systems.  Some of the
 top weapons experts in the US military and in
 industry helped us.
 Impact of Changes on Dollar Cost Estimates
 II.    To illustrate the impact of these changes, let me
 now discuss our latest estimates of what it would
 cost in dollars to reproduce Soviet military pro-
 grams in the US.
 25
 Approved For Release 2004/0 /   KI   DP83M00171 ROO1100010011-3
 Approved For Release 2004/0'I?20c 1 -   P83M00171 R001100010011-3
 A.   Our current estimate -- shown on this chart --
 is that the dollar cost of Soviet military
 programs for 1975 is 114 billion dollars,
 expressed in constant 1974 prices.   (Chart:
 US Expenditures and Estimated DoZZar Costs of
 Soviet Defense Programs)   That total exceeds
 comparable US authorizations for 1975 by about
 40 percent.
 1.   If the costs of pensions are subtracted
 from both sides, Soviet programs in 1975
 exceed US authorizations by some 50 percent.
 B.   The last published CIA estimate, disseminated
 in January 1975, showed the total dollar costs.
 of Soviet defense programs exceeding US auth-
 orizations by 20 percent in 1974.
 C.   The estimates which I have been discussing
 with you today show the dollar costs of Soviet
 programs exceeding the US authorizations in
 1974 by about 30 percent.
 D.   This upward adjustment of about 10 percent was
 caused by two factors.   The first was a down-
 ward revision in US authorizations in the
 latest Five Year Defense Program.   But more
 important were the changes. which I have just

 SECRET
 Approved For Release 2004/01/20 : CIA-RDP83MOOl71 R001100010011-3
 described in our estimates-of the size and
 costs of Soviet programs.
 1.   The comparison between US and Soviet pro-
 grams is particularly striking in the.in-
 vestment area, shown on this chart.   (Chart:
 DoZZar Cost of Soviet Programs as a Percent
 of US Defense Expenditures -- Investment
 Cost)   In investment -- which includes pro-
 curement of weapons and equipment and con-
 struction.of facilities -- estimated dollar
 costs for Soviet programs exceeded US spend-
 ing by 85 percent in 1975.
 E.   I'd like to note that the comparisons I've just
 made represent nearly the limit of utility of
 our dollar cost estimates.
 1.   They can provide a -general appreciation of
 the magnitude of Soviet defense activities
 in terms familiar to US decision makers.
 They can also reveal broad trends in re-
 lationships between the US and Soviet de-
 fense establishments that are difficult to
 measure in other ways.
 2.   While there is some relationship between
 dollar costs and military capabilities,
 Approved For Release 2004/0,?M RIILOIDP83M00171 R001100010011-3
 Approved For Release 2004/0ISO :  1 -' 'DP83M00171R001100010011-3
 the dollar cost estimates can not be used
 to draw inferences about relative military
 effectiveness.   Other data, such as the
 composition of the forces, the character-
 istics of weapons, and the strategic en-
 vironment in which they might be used, are
 far more important in making such judgments.
 3.   Moreover, we should bear in mind that the
 two powers have different military require-
 ments.   Our bombers, for example, impose a
 heavy need on the USSR for air defense; the
 reverse is not true.
 4.   Nor can these dollar numbers be used to
 draw conclusions about the burden of de-
 fense on the Soviet economy.  For that
 purpose we estimate Soviet defense spend-
 ing in rubles.

 Revision in Ruble Estimates
 254
 A.   Our ruble estimates -- like the dollar esti-
 mates I have just discussed -- are based pri-
 marily on a direct-costing methodology.
 1.   Both estimates begin with the detailed
 identification and listing of the physi-
 cal components and activities which make
 up the Soviet defense program for a given
 year.   The physical forces and programs
 which we cost in rubles are precisely
 the same as those which we cost in dollars.
 Consequently, changes in our appreciation
 of the Soviet force structure have an
 impact on both the ruble and dollar esti-
 mates.
 2.   To estimate some ruble expenditures, like
 personnel costs, we apply ruble costs di-
 rectly.  For other items, we convert the
 estimated dollar costs of Soviet equip-

 Approved For Release 2004/O W.    -RDP83MOOl71 R001 100010011-3
 ment and activities to ruble terms.   We
 do this by applying ruble-to-dollar con-
 version ratios for various classes of
 equipment and programs, reflecting our
 appreciation of the relation of Soviet
 to US prices in these areas.
 B.   As a result of an intensive collection and
 analytical effort over the past several
 years, we have acquired a great deal of
 new information on the ruble prices of
 Soviet military equipment.   This new
 data --
 has changed
 markedly our appreciation of the ruble
 costs of Soviet military programs, parti-
 cularly in high technology areas.   This
 resulted in major adjustments in many of
 the ratios used for conversion from dollar
 to ruble terms.

 2.   We have also acquired a number of ruble
 prices for Soviet aircraft and their
 components, as well as for missile
 components and electronics.  Analysis
 of this information indicated that in
 these areas -- as in shipbuilding --
 major upward adjustments were required
 in our ruble-to-dollar conversion ratios.

 fense spending in rubles.   (Chart:   Esti-
 mated Soviet Expenditures for Defense,
 1970-75)
 1.   In our estimates, we have postulated two
 possible definitions of defense activity,
 because we do not know precisely how
 the Soviets account for their defense
 programs.   Using a definition which
 encompasses a range of activities
 comparable to those included in the US
 budgetary definition of defense, we esti-
 mate that the USSR spent some 40-45
 billion rubles in 1970.   In 1975 esti-
 mated total outlays for these purposes
 had risen to 50-55 billion rubles,
 measured in constant 1970 rubles.
 This is shown by the lower band on this
 chart.
 a.   Under a broader definition -- one
 which the Soviets might use and
 which would include additional
 military-operated programs such
 as the entire space program we estimate that total defense

 billion rubles in 1975.   This
 definition is portrayed by the

 low shows the announced Soviet
 defense budget.
 2.   The new estimates for 1975 are about
 twice the previous intelligence estimate
 of defense spending in that year.   About
 90 percent of the increase in the estimate
 is accounted for by our new understanding
 of Soviet prices and costs.
 3.   Our new estimates indicate that the average
 rate of growth in ruble expenditures for
 defense during 1970-75 was 4-5 percent.
 The annual growth rates varied during the
 period, however, as shown on the lower
 part of the chart, reflecting primarily
 the contraction and expansion of procure-
 ment outlays for strategic missiles.
 Historically, the growth in total Soviet
 defense spending has accelerated during
 periods when the USSR re-equips its forces

 with new strategic weapons.  As these
 programs reach completion, the rate of
 growth in overall spending tends to decline.
 4.   Previous estimates, while showing the
 same general pattern of growth, placed
 the long-run average annual rate of growth
 of Soviet defense expenditures in rubles
 at about 3 percent.   The new ruble prices
 of military hardware indicate that high-
 technology programs -- the most rapidly
 growing component of Soviet military ex-
 penditures -- are much more costly to the
 Soviets than we previously believed.  As
 a result, the new estimates show more
 rapid growth.
 5.   This chart shows how our new estimates
 of ruble prices for Soviet equi ment
 have affected the growth rates.  (Chart:

 defense spending in rubles.   This growth
 reflects both the emphasis the Soviets
 are putting on modernizing their forces
 with new, high technology systems and
 the fact that these items are extremely
 costly to them.
 I want to emphasize, however, that

 much of the new data underlying the revision is
 still being evaluated.   Consequently, the esti-
 mates should be considered as interim, and sub-
 ject to change as the work progresses and new
 information is acquired.
 C.    The methodology we use contains inherent limi-
 tations and while the new data do improve our
 confidence in the present results, they must
 be treated with reserve.
 Resource Implications
 V. To close this portion of the briefing, I'd like to
 discuss the resource implications of our new ruble
 estimates.  Although no single measure adequately
 describes the economic impact of the Soviet defense
 effort, defense spending as a share of gross na-
 tional product is often used for this purpose.
 A.   When measured according to a definition of de-
 fense activities roughly comparable to that
 used in the US, the Soviet defense effort ab-
 sorbs some 11-12 percent of Soviet GNP.   When
 the calculation is based on the broader defini-
 tion of defense, the share increases to about
 Approved For Release 2004/0M RII   DP83M00171 R001100010011-3
 Approved For Release 2004/01720 NAIP83M00171R001100010011-3
 12-13 percent.   Because the rate of growth in
 defense spending was roughly the same as the
 growth in GNP during 1970-75, there was little
 change over the period in the share taken by
 defense.
 1.   The new estimate of the share of defense
 in the Soviet GNP is almost twice as high
 as the 6-8 percent previously estimated.
 As Mr. Bush stated earlier, this does
 not mean that the impact of defense pro-
 grams on the Soviet economy has increased:
 -- only that our appreciation of this im-
 pact has changed.   It also implies that
 Soviet defense industries are far less ef-
 ficient than we formerly believed.
 B.   Another economic aggregate which may be used
 to describe the impact of defense programs on
 the economy as a whole is the defense share of
 machinery output.  At present Soviet defense
 takes about one third of the output of the
 machine-building and metal-working sector --
 the sector that produces investment goods as
 well as military weapons and equipment.

 Approved For Release 2004/01/20 :       P83M00171R001100010011-3
 C.   We do not know exactly how the Soviet leaders
 evaluate the size and economic burden of defense.
 Some leaders often make public statements which
 reflect their concern about the sacrifices in
 economic growth and consumer satisfaction that
 follow from their defense priorities.   This
 concern, however, has not prevented steady in-
 creases in military programs.   Major defense
 programs have been generously supported even
 in periods of economic setbacks.
 1.   Of course this situation may not always ob-
 tain, and the problem of lagging economic
 growth will make steadily rising defense
 costs a painful issue for the leadership.
 a.   But the economic burden will not be the
 only, or perhaps even the major, con-
 sideration in its specific decisions on
 future defense programs.
 b.   Other factors -- such as the leaders'
 views of foreign military threats, the
 powerful institutional forces which
 support defense programs, progress in
 arms limitations negotiations, and the

 momentum of technological advances in
 the defense sector -- will also have a
 major impact.
 2.  While the implications for future programs
 of our new perception of the Soviet defense
 effort are not yet clear, we believe that
 long-term growth in military spending will
 continue, albeit perhaps at a more moderate
 pace for the next few years.   The annual
 increment in Soviet GNP is large enough to
 allow both increases in defense spending
 and at least slow improvements in living
 standards.  Moreover, even the present level
 of Soviet defense investment programs is so
 high that with modest rates of growth -- or
 even with a constant level of defense spend-
 ing -- inventories of military equipment
 could continue to rise.  Much work remains
 to be done, however, in assessing the im-
 plications of our new estimates of ruble
 defense expenditures for future Soviet
 policy decisions.

 PART III:   THE CHINESE ECONOMY
 Data Availability
 I. In turning to China, Mr. Chairman,  let me stress one
 basic analytical problem: very little hard economic
 information is available on China, compared with the
 large amounts concerning the USSR.
 A.   Nevertheless, we do have enough data
 the outlines of economic policy; to analyze for-
 eign trade in some detail; and to ascertain gen-
 eral trends in domestic output, weapons develop-
 ment, construction, and consumer welfare.
 Development Objectives
 II.   In its planning, Peking has two fundamental economic
 objectives:   first, to maintain an adequate level of
 food and clothing for the growing population; and
 second, to develop a modern industrial base that,
 while small, will be capable of supporting a strong
 defense force.
 A.   In pursuit of these objectives, China initially
 adopted the Soviet model for both its economic
 organization and its pattern of resource alloca-
 tion.

 Approved For Release 2004/01/20: CIA RDP83M00171R001100010011-3
 B.   Soon, however,  it became apparent that Soviet-
 style policies and institutions were in many
 ways inappropriate.
 C.   In the first major reform, you may recall that
 in 1957 Peking tried to increase efficiency by
 revamping its highly centralized planning and
 management procedures to allow for greater par-
 ticipation by the provinces and lower levels.
 D.   The second major change was begun in the early
 1960s, following a series of crop failures.
 China was forced to increase the share of re-
 sources going to agriculture.
 1.   With land limited, expansion of production
 had to come from increased yields.   This in
 turn required costly modern inputs such as
 chemical fertilizers.
 2.   The priority accorded agriculture showed most
 recently in 1972-73 when the Chinese de-
 cided to make large-scale purchases of Western
 plants and equipment to produce chemical
 fertilizer and synthetic fibers.
 E.   Next in investment priority, following agriculture
 and those industries directly supporting agricul-
 ture, are certain segments of industry, the

 SECRET
 Approved For Release 2004/01/20 : CIA-RDP83MOOl71 R001100010011-3
 military establishment, and transportation and
 communications.
 1.   In industry, the favored positions of the
 petroleum and petrochemical industries are
 clear.   An investment shift benefiting coal
 and iron ore mining, and especially finishing
 facilities for steel products, has also been
 taking place.
 2.  In transportation, large investments have
 been made at China's major seaports to handle
 the recent sizable expansion in foreign
 trade.
 Consumption Trends
 III.    What, you may ask, has been the result of these shifts
 on the Chinese people?
 A.   Probably most important is the fact that per capita
 real consumption has gradually risen, even though
 the share of national output going for consump-
 tion has steadily declined.   This rise in consump-
 tion has appeared largely first in industrial con-
 sumer goods and second in services provided by
 the state, particularly health and education.
 1.   Consumption has grown most rapidly in rural
 areas.   They have benefited from government
 policy to encourage production and to narrow

 the gap between income in the countryside
 and the cities.
 2.   The slower rate of urban consumption growth
 has caused some labor problems in recent
 years. Average wages are now only slightly
 above the level of the late 1950s.
 B.   Widespread dissatisfaction with wages became ap-
 parent during the 1974 campaign to criticize
 Lin Piao and Confucius.
 1.   Despite a highly-charged political atmosphere,
 which made it risky to complain about personal
 welfare, workers persisted in voicing their
 grievances.
 2.   While officials have hinted that the problem
 will be dealt with in the future, it will not
 be readily solved because it involves politi-
 cal issues of ideological versus material
 motivation -- plus the practical problems of
 allocating scarce resources.
 Economic Growth Since 1965
 IV.   I will now turn to the trend of Chinese  economic growth
 over the past ten years.   (Chart:  China:   GNP, Industrial
 Production, and Agricultural Production)
 Approved For Release 2004/S         RDP83M00171 R001100010011-3
 Approved For Release 20041  TT0'tir -RDP83M00171 R001100010011-3
 A.   As this chart shows, the rise has been impres-
 sive, but erratic.   Domestic political upheavals
 largely explain the uneven pattern.
 1.   As you see, production fell sharply in the
 aftermath of the Great Leap Forward  (1958-
 60) and to a lesser extent during the Cul-
 tural Revolution (1966-69).
 2.   The anti-Confucius campaign in 1974 -- al-
 though less disruptive -- took its toll slow-
 ing the expansion of output.
 B.    Nevertheless, with the help of a large investment
 program, China's gross national product in 1975
 was roughly 75 percent larger than it was'in
 1965.
 Industry
 V.   China's industrial production grew at an even faster
 pace.   In 1975 it was almost two and a half times
 the level of 1965 -- an average annual growth rate
 of 9 percent.   (Chart:  China and USSR:   Industrial
 Production)
 A.   You can see that Chinese industrial growth
 compares favorably with that of the USSR, even
 though the pattern has been much less steady.
 B.   As would be expected in an economy stressing
 investment, output of producer goods has grown
 - 44 -
 Approved For Release 20041g1RDP83M00171R001100010011-3
 Approved For Release MOM icc   i -RDP83M00171 R001100010011-3
 more rapidly than has production of consumer
 items -- averaging 10.5 percent a year.
 1.   Machinery production, a major component
 of producer goods, has grown even more
 rapidly -- by 14 percent yearly.
 2.   Progress in the petroleum industry has been
 particularly noteworthy.   In the past decade,
 crude oil production has grown seven-fold,
 from 220,000 barrels a day to 1.6 million
 barrels a day.
 3.   But even in those sectors where growth has
 been less spectacular, substantial progress
 has been made:   in steel, a troubled indus-
 try in recent years, output during the past
 decade has more than doubled.
 D.   In comparison, the growth of industrial consumer
 goods production has averaged 7 percent yearly
 since 1965.
 1.   Some items, made entirely from industrial
 raw materials, have grown more rapidly; for
 example, the output of bicycles has risen by
 13 percent yearly.
 2.   Other items, which depend on raw materials
 from agriculture, are relatively sluggish;

 SECRET
 Approved For Release 2004/01/20 : CIA-RDP83MOOl71 R001100010011-3
 for example, cotton cloth production has
 grown by only 2 percent yearly.
 E.    Since most consumer goods in China are derived
 either directly or indirectly from agriculture,
 the practical necessity for heavy investment in
 agriculture becomes more apparent from the above
 data.
 F.    Before turning to agriculture, I would make a
 few comments on industry's figures for 1975,
 when production rose by about 10 percent, up
 from only 5 percent in 1974.
 1.   First, the factors that lowered performance
 in 1974 -- coal shortages, work stoppages,
 and transport tie-ups -- were less prominent
 in 1975.
 2.   These depressing factors still had their af-
 fect,. however.   For example, steel production,
 which grew by 9 percent in 1975, was never-
 theless only 2 percent higher than in 1973.
 3.   In contrast, the petroleum industry continued
 its strong growth, with a 20 percent increase.
 4.   Healthy gains were reported for other commodi-
 ties,. but in many instances these gains
 largely represented a step-up from the lack-
 luster performance of 1974.

 Agriculture
 VI.  Now, a few points on China's agricultural picture.
 A. First of all, foodgrain production in the
 past decade has barely kept pace with the
 estimated 2 percent annual growth in'popu-
 lation.   And, cotton output has not even
 met this low rate of growth -- growing by only
 16 percent over the entire ten-year period.
 B.   This may be a good place to draw attention
 to Peking's recent successes in population
 control.
 1.   New research indicates.that annual popu-
 lation growth has fallen appreciably
 since 1970, perhaps from 2.3 percent in
 1970 to 1.8 percent in 1975.  A con-
 tinuation of present policies should
 lead to even further drops in the birth
 rate.
 2.   These gains reflect Peking's sober ap-
 praisal of the difficulties inherent in
 raising agricultural output.
 C.    To return to agriculture, it is interest-
 ing to note that year-to-year fluctuations
 in Chinese output of grain have historically
 Approved For Release 2004/SO ~0   A   DP83M00171R001100010011-3
 QvQR
 Approved For Release 2004YOR/20-:UTA-RDP83M00171R001100010011-3
 been much narrower than fluctuations in So-
 viet output, as this chart shows.   (Chart:
 China and USSR:   Grain Output)
 1.   Over the past five years, for example,
 Soviet grain output has fluctuated by
 as much as 27 percent from expected out-
 put, compared with a maximum deviation
 of about 2.5 percent for China.
 2.   The primary reasons are differences in
 cropping practices and weather patterns.
 a.   China practices multiple cropping,
 and weather patterns rarely produce
 a poor harvest in both North and
 South China in the same year.
 b.        In contrast, the Soviet Union pro-
 duces more than two thirds of its
 grain in regions of marginal pre-
 cipitation, frequently subject to
 drought.
 D.    In 1975, Chinese agricultural production
 showed no appreciable improvement over 1974.
 1.   Foodgrain production was essentially
 unchanged from the record crop of about
 260 million tons  (excluding soybeans)
 in 1974.

 Approved For Release 200/W ~IXRDP83M00171 R001100010011-3
 2.   Soybeans and some minor industrial crops
 gained slightly; cotton output may have
 declined by as much as 10 percent.
 3.   Improved harvests in regions surround-
 ing North China's major cities permitted
 a reduction in grain imports in 1975 to
 only 3.3 million tons, about one half
 the 1974 level.   Shipments were almost
 entirely under long-term agreements with
 Canada and Australia.
 4.   China re-entered the world cotton market
 last fall and had purchased 70,000 tons
 by the end of the year.
 Foreign Trade
 VII.   I will now turn to China's foreign trade.   China's
 total trade was $14 billion in both 1974 and 1975,
 as shown in this chart.   (Chart: China:  Foreign
 Trade,  by Major Area)
 A.   Taking a longer view, the value of China's
 foreign trade in 1975 was more than three
 and a half times trade in 1965, although the
 growth shown for recent years is exaggerated
 greatly by price increases.
 1.   The past decade also saw a further shift
 in China's trade orientation toward the
 Developed West and away from the USSR.

 Approved For Release 200 6'    '  -RDP83M00171 R001 100010011-3
 Whereas two thirds of trade was with
 Communist nations in the late 1950s,
 the share now is less than 20 percent.
 B.   The jump in imports in recent years in part
 reflects Chinese willingness to incur debt
 in order to purchase Western industrial
 plants and transport equipment in quantity,
 as shown in this chart by the trade deficits
 since 1973.   (Chart: China:   Trends in For-
 eign Trade)
 1.   In 1974, the Western recession depressed
 demand for Chinese exports and contributed
 to a record trade deficit of $800 million.
 2.   In 1975, by trimming imports and pushing
 exports, the deficit was reduced to less
 than $400 million.
 C.   Imports of machinery and equipment continued
 to climb in 1975, reaching $2 billion, com-
 pared with $1.6 billion in 1974 and $330
 million back in 1965.
 D.   By contrast, China cut back sharply last
 year in agricultural imports.

 Approved For Release 200,61BG2R--1W-RDP83M00171R001100010011-3
 1.   At $820 million, they were less than half
 the 1974 figure and not much greater than
 the $710 million of the years earlier.
 E.   China's emergence in 1973 as an oil exporter
 came at an opportune time.
 1.   Earnings from expanding oil exports have
 compensated for falling demand in the
 West for Chinese textiles and a variety
 of light manufactures and handicrafts.
 2.   Oil exports of 172,000 barrels a day to
 non-Communist countries earned $750
 million in 1975, up from 88,000 barrels
 a day and $450 million in 1974.
 F.   During 1975 a pause took place in new pur-
 chases of whole plants from the West in or-
 der to absorb the industrial plants already
 ordered.
 1.   During 1972-74, China signed contracts
 for about 110 plants, worth $2.2 billion,
 for delivery through 1978.
 Trade With the United States
 VIII.   As for United States - China trade, the surplus
 of almost $700 million enjoyed by the US in 1974
 fell to less than $150 million in 1975.

 A.    Agricultural exports, which accounted for
 80 percent of total US exports to China in
 1972-74, have been phased out for the time
 being.
 B.    US exports to China in 1976 may be less than
 the $300 million of 1975.
 1.   In contrast to farm products, however,
 US industrial exports should continue
 strong on the basis of previous contracts
 for plants and equipment.
 C.    This year, US imports from China may rise
 to $200 million from the $160 million of
 last year.
 Foreign Economic Aid
 IX.   One other element worth noting is China's foreign
 economic assistance program.   (Map-chart:   China:
 Aid Activities,  1956-75)   During the past two
 decades, Peking has pledged $4 billion in economic
 aid to the LDCs, about two-thirds of the total going
 to Africa.   This aid is provided through interest-
 free credits with extended repayment schedules.
 A.   About $1.7 billion of this aid has already
 been drawn.
 B.   The single most important project has been
 the recently completed $400 million Tan-Zam

 Railroad, which links the Zambian copper belt
 to the Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam.
 C.   In 1975 the general pattern continued.   Peking
 signed agreements for new aid totaling about
 $300 million, of which $180 million was with
 African countries.

 PART IV:   THE COSTS OF CHINESE DEFENSE PROGRAMS
 I. In this last section of my prepared statement,
 Mr. Chairman, I will comment on the costs of China's
 defense programs.           The basic consideration to bear
 in mind is that the Chinese military in many ways
 mirrors the economy that supports it.
 A.   For its combat strength, the greater part of
 China's armed forces relies upon manpower and
 easily manufactured, low-technology weaponry.
 This like most of China's economy is labor inten-
 sive, with little capital.
 B.   In contrast, China has also developed and de-
 ployed a limited number of modern weapons, re-
 flecting the mastery of some of the technology of
 an advanced industrial nation by the economy's
 small, capital-intensive sector.
 defense production accounts for a large portion
 of activity in the advanced industrial sector --
 far larger, for example, than is the case in the
 US or USSR.
 D.   Some understanding of trends in China's defense
 effort can be obtained by examining our esti-

 Approved For Release 2004 WIR&  RDP83M00171 R001 100010011-3
 mates of dollar costs for procurement of mili-
 tary equipment.
 1.   The term "procurement" as we use it here
 includes only the cost of producing arms
 and equipment, not any costs-associated with
 research, development, testing, and evalua-
 tion (RDT&E), or those for facilities, per-
 sonnel or operations and maintenance.
 2.   Let me remind you that dollar cost estimates
 reflect the cost of reproducing the Chinese
 programs in the US.
 II.    Chinese military procurement, as measured in constant
 1974 dollars, grew very rapidly in the late 1960s,
 but after 1971 fell substantially.   For the next three
 years it remained at a plateau about equal to the 1969
 level as shown in this chart.   (Chart:   China: Military
 Procurement).
 A.   Much of the decline resulted from a sharp drop
 in aircraft production, but there was some slow-
 down in almost all of the Chinese weapon procure-
 ment programs.   (Preliminary rough estimates
 show a somewhat similar trend in RDT&E costs,
 with rapid growth in the late sixties, a peak
 in the 1970-71 period, and a subsequent decline.)

 B.   As you can also see in the chart, there was a
 distinct rise in estimated procurement costs in
 1975, although the level is still much below the
 1971 peak.
 1.   Most of this increase is attributable to
 more costly aircraft and to some increase
 in ship production.
 C.   What meaning do we attach to the lower level of
 procurement since 1971?
 1.   It does not involve a reduction in Chinese
 forces, but rather shows that new equipment
 is being delivered to the forces at a slower
 rate.
 2.   The primary reasons for this decline probably
 are:
 --.a reduced likelihood of armed conflict
 with the Soviet Union;
 -- new priorities favoring civilian economic
 growth by a less military-oriented lead-
 ership; and
 -- difficulty in developing follow-on ad-
 vanced weapon systems.

 III.    China's past history of sudden bursts and unexpected
 reductions in defense production makes it difficult
 to judge whether the upturn in 1975 is a temporary
 phenomenon, or the beginning of a long-term trend.
 I offer a couple of projections, however.*
 A.   First, over the next several years, as the Chi-
 nese begin to replace obsolescent equipment with
 more modern systems, procurement costs can
 be expected to grow somewhat, even if produc-
 tion in terms of numbers of units does not in-
 crease.
 1.   In 1975, for example, the increased produc-
 tion costs of a few relatively more modern
 and expensive weapon systems more than off-
 set savings from the reduced production of
 older and cheaper weaponry.
 B.   Second, the present general ordering of military
 versus civilian priorities probably will persist
 through this decade, no matter who wins the cur-
 rent struggle for political power.
 1.   This is because the two most important bases
 of this ordering will continue to be the
 controlling factors for the remainder of this
 decade.   I refer to the cost and difficulty

 Approved For Release 2004?T'1'/20`    -RDP83M00171 R001100010011-3
 of a more ambitious weapons effort, and the
 urgency of China's need to modernize and
 expand its basic agricultural and industrial
 production capacity.
 C.   Third and last, this does not preclude further
 military growth and modernization.
 1.   If economic factors dominate defense policy
 decisions, the growth and modernization can
 be expected to proceed at a measured pace
 that will probably increase gradually as
 China's industrial base expands.
 2.   A sudden diversion of resources into defense
 production, however, can not be ruled out
 if Chinese policymakers were to perceive a
 substantially greater external threat.  As
 you know, China's perception of an increased
 threat from the USSR in the late sixties led
 to the rapid expansion in defense programs at
 that time.
 3.   Moreover, China's now enlarged military indus-
 trial base, resulting from that buildup,
 provides China with the potential for a much
 greater military production effort.
