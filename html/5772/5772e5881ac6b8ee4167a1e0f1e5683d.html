Preface 
Information available 
as of 1 August 1989 
was used in this report. 
The Chinese Economy in 1988 
and 1989: Reforms on Hold, 
Economic Problems Mount 
China's leaders experienced the greatest challenge to the authority of the 
Communist Party in 40 years of rule when massive demonstrations swept 
China this spring. The protests were symptomatic of public dissatisfaction 
with the leadership because of its unwillingness to make the political 
system more responsive to public concerns and inability to control growing 
official corruption, nepotism, and inflation?which approached 30 percent 
in China's cities last year, the highest level since the Communists came to 
power. 
The demonstrations sparked leadership maneuvering that toppled Zhao 
Ziyang, one of China's most ardent market-oriented reformers, from the 
party's top post. An expanded meeting of the Communist Party Central 
Committee in June elevated leaders who believe greater political, ideologi-
cal, and social control is necessary and who generally advocate economic 
reform strategies that emphasize improved central planning rather than 
experiments with market measures. 
The unrest has weakened Beijing's ability to solve the country's economic 
problems. The preoccupation of China's leaders with consolidating power, 
restoring ideological orthodoxy, and maintaining social order will probably 
prevent them from formulating new solutions to the country's economic 
problems. Consequently, China's reform program is likely to be bogged 
down for the next few years. Indeed, key market reforms like price 
decontrol and bankruptcy?which Beijing put on hold in the fall of 1988 
when it began implementing an austerity program?will be postponed 
indefinitely. 
Inflation is likely to remain a problem. With economic reforms on hold, in-
dustrial efficiency and labor productivity will lag, and Beijing will have 
difficulty stimulating production of grain and industrial raw materials, 
items chronically in short supply. At the same time, pressures to increase 
government expenditures will probably grow in the aftermath of the 
demonstrations, fueling inflation. Beijing may attempt to increase food 
subsidies and loans to state enterprises to minimize the impact of rising 
prices on its restive urban labor force. To head off growing unhappiness 
among peasants?who are being pressed to grow more grain but are having 
increasing difficulty obtaining inputs and are being paid in IOUs?China's 
central bank may have to loosen credit restraints in the countryside. 
Defense expenditures also may rise because military leaders are exerting

greater influence in Beijing following their suppression of the demonstra-
tions. Persistent inflation will fuel social unrest by eroding standards of 
living, but rigorous enforcement of the austerity policies would probably 
swell the ranks of unemployed, embitter workers whose income subsidies 
do not keep pace with price rises, and anger farmers paid with IOUs for 
their crops. 
Finally, Beijing's ability to draw on foreign resources to alleviate domestic 
shortages, promote exports, and fund infrastructure and industrial projects 
has been diminished by the reluctance of foreign businessmen and 
governments to sign new investment and loan agreements. Although China 
can probably weather the expected decline in tourism revenues and slower 
export growth this year, the downturn in China's international economic 
relations may dim China's long-term economic prospects. For example, 
industrial and export growth would probably slow if?to forestall a steep 
decline in its foreign exchange reserves?Beijing broadens its restrictions 
on imports to include capital equipment and raw materials. Moreover, if 
foreign businessmen choose alternative Asian sites for new technology-
intensive investment projects, China will have greater difficulty competing 
with Asian exporters like Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines in the 
1990s.

The Chinese Economy in 1988 
and 1989: Reforms on Hold, 
Economic Problems Mount 
Problems of an Overheated Economy 
China's economic problems continued to mount in 
1988 as the leadership failed to check overly rapid 
growth, soaring inflation, increasing official corrup-
tion, and a deteriorating trade balance. According to 
Chinese statistics, GNP grew by more than 11 per-
cent in real terms and industrial output surged 21 
percent, nearly three times the target rate. This 
intensified China's chronic energy and raw materials 
shortages and transportation bottlenecks and, in turn, 
pushed inflation to its highest level in nearly 40 years, 
19 percent overall and almost 30 percent in China's 
cities. (See appendix A for a detailed review by sector 
of economic performance in 1988.) 
The overheating occurred partly because Beijing re-
laxed credit controls in early 1988, apparently to 
"prime the pump" for industrial and export growth 
(see figure 1). China's currency in circulation in-
creased 47 percent last year, adding to demand 
pressures that had been building since 1984, when 
Beijing sharply expanded the autonomy that industri-
al enterprises could exercise over investment, wages, 
and spending for their workers' social welfare. Urban 
enterprises financed these expenditures from retained 
earnings and by borrowing from China's central bank 
and from a growing number of nonbank financial 
institutions. In rural areas, local governments and 
informal credit cooperatives funded a dramatic ex-
pansion in rural industries and such commercial 
activities as marketing and transportation. 
Inflationary pressures were intensified because of 
lagging agricultural production. The value of overall 
farm output inched up only 3 percent. Grain produc-
tion actually fell 2 percent because of adverse weath-
er, low state-set procurement prices, and rising costs 
of agricultural inputs like fertilizer and plastic sheet-
ing, which is used as mulch. Sluggish production of 
industrial crops like sugar, ramie, and cotton caused 
production costs to rise in food processing and textile 
industries. 
1 
The acute shortages of raw materials gave rise to 
increased speculation and profiteering by local offi-
cials who acquired scarce goods at low in-plan prices 
and resold them on the market. Profits from such 
activities can be substantial; market prices for steel, 
fertilizer, and grain are two to three times the in-plan 
price. The increase in profiteering diverted industrial 
materials earmarked for use by state-owned enter-
prises to the collective and private sectors, where 
enterprises were willing to pay higher prices. In rural 
areas, officials frequently charged peasants high mar-
ket prices for fertilizer and other scarce agricultural 
inputs that Beijing had promised to make available at 
low, state-set rates. Consequently, peasants reduced 
applications of fertilizer on fields, which hurt yields. 
Inflation also caused income disparities to widen. 
Rural entrepreneurs and urban street vendors were 
able to cash in on surging demand for goods because 
they sell their merchandise at market prices. Wages 
of teachers and government bureaucrats are generally 
fixed, however, so their incomes failed to keep up with 
inflation. Overall, real urban incomes rose only 1 
percent, according to Chinese statistics. 
Trade Balance Worsens 
Imports surged in the second half of 1988 as China 
turned to foreign suppliers for many of the industrial 
and agricultural products it could not supply domesti-
cally. In particular, China's imports of fertilizer, 
sugar, and cotton rose sharply. China also imported 
15 million metric tons of grain. 
A sharp increase in exports?a result of incentives to 
state trading companies introduced in early 1988?
was a mixed blessing. Rapid export growth worsened 
domestic shortages of energy and raw materials and 
bid up domestic prices. Because China's skewed do-
mestic price structure severely underprices raw mate-
rials and energy, trading companies rushed to export 
these commodities when Beijing eased control over 
the foreign trade sector. Exports of pig iron, steel,

coal, nonferrous metals, raw silk, and cotton all 
jumped even though domestic factories were reporting 
shortages of the same goods. Trade corporations 
reaped large profits by buying these goods at low, 
state-set prices and exporting them at higher interna-
tional prices. 
Rapid export growth also widened regional income 
disparities, which have been a source of debate within 
the leadership. Coastal provinces, with relatively mod-
ern factories, a fairly skilled work force, and access to 
ports and rail lines that link China to the outside 
world, have provided more than 70 percent of China's 
exports in recent years. This has given them greater 
access to credit and foreign exchange, more rapid 
gains in income, and greater independence from Beij-
ing than the inland provinces have enjoyed. The 
323013 8-89 
interior areas, unhappy about the growing regional 
income disparities last year, boosted interprovincial 
trade barriers to protect their supplies and prevent the 
wealthier coastal provinces from bidding up prices of 
their industrial supplies, coal, grain, and pork. 
Economic Reforms Stall as Beijing Attempts To 
Reassert Control 
Spurred by these mounting problems, Chinese leaders 
announced at a party plenum in September 1988 that 
they would postpone key market reforms for several 
years and implement an austerity program to cool the 
economy. In particular, Beijing shelved a plan to push

ahead with price decontrol, currency devaluation, and 
reduced state intervention in raw materials distribu-
tion, which apparently was sponsored by former party 
chief Zhao Ziyang. Leaders were concerned because 
rumors of impending price reforms, proposed by Deng 
Xiaoping in May 1988, prompted bank runs and panic 
buying sprees in July and August 1988. Continuing 
bank runs could have caused serious dislocations; 
consumers' bank accounts total 380 billion yuan ($103 
billion)?equivalent to 27 percent of GNP. 
As part of its retrenchment plan, Beijing has issued a 
series of directives since September 1988 designed to 
slow capital construction, restrict spending, and con-
trol price hikes: 
? Beijing announced it would cut state investment 
spending by 20 percent in 1989. The burden is to 
fall on nonproductive projects such as worker hous-
ing and recreational facilities. 
? To discourage bank-financed investment outside the 
state plan, Beijing tightened credit ceilings for its 
domestic banks and raised interest rates on bank 
loans. Chinese authorities have also called for a halt 
in loans to private and rural enterprises. 
? China's central bank hiked interest rates on house-
hold deposits, indexing those with maturities of 
three years or longer to the retail price index, and 
imposed limits on the amounts individuals could 
withdraw from savings accounts. 
? Beijing reduced the number of government entities 
authorized to borrow funds abroad from 100 to only 
10 to slow the flow of credit acquired through 
foreign channels. 
? Beijing reimposed price controls for steel, copper, 
aluminum, and other production materials. 
? The State Council recentralized control over the 
production and marketing of certain steel products 
and nonferrous metals. The central government also 
reestablished its monopoly over the distribution of 
fertilizer, pesticides, and plastic sheeting to control 
speculation in farm inputs. 
3 
? To stimulate lagging agricultural production, Beij-
ing announced an increase in the state procurement 
prices paid to peasants for their grain, sugar, and 
oil-bearing crops. Beijing also hiked the state pro-
curement price of coal. 
Since September 1988, Beijing has also reasserted 
central control over foreign trade. To curb exports of 
scarce commodities, Beijing expanded the number of 
products subject to export licenses, quotas, and out-
right bans. It also tightened control over imports by 
restricting the number of corporations authorized to 
import several products, by banning purchases of 
selected consumer goods and industrial inputs, and by 
tightening control over the use of foreign exchange 
retained by exporters in Bank of China accounts. In 
addition, Beijing reduced the share of foreign ex-
change that China's five Special Economic Zones 
(SEZs) were permitted to retain from their exports. 
Problems Persist in 1989 
Chinese statistics for the first half of 1989 indicate 
that these efforts have been only partially effective. 
China's industrial growth rate fell by almost one-half 
to about 11 percent, but inflation continued at a more 
than 25-percent annual clip. Although Beijing was 
able to sharply slow growth in capital construction 
spending during early 1989, the impact seems to have 
hurt state enterprises more than collective or rural 
industries. According to Chinese statistics, rural en-
terprises grew three times faster than key state-
dominated sectors such as energy during the first 
quarter. Thus, slower overall growth did not ease 
inflationary pressures. 
Demand pressures have apparently also been sus-
tained because of weaknesses in the enforcement of 
Beijing's retrenchment program. For example, Beijing 
apparently loosened credit restraints in March 1989 
because of concern about a sharp decline in produc-
tion of state-owned enterprises. Meanwhile, factories 
were circumventing the credit controls by drawing on 
the resources of widespread nongovernment financial 
institutions. Access to financing from Hong Kong 
enabled many enterprises, particularly in the southern

Government Intervention in China's Trade Sector 
Chinese officials have acknowledged that Beijing 
plans no further progress on foreign trade reform for 
the next few years. Thus, extensive state controls will 
continue to guide China's trade. Beijing still restricts 
the number of entities that are authorized to conduct 
trade; export and import prices remain largely state-
determined; and the government continues to provide 
financial support to unprofitable factories and trade 
corporations. Moreover, the value of China's noncon-
vertible currency is still fixed by central authorities. 
Trade Subject to Plans. Roughly 70 percent of 
China's trade?both exports and imports?remain 
subject to either "mandatory" plans set by Beijing or 
"guidance" plans negotiated by central and local 
officials. 
Restrictions on Authorized Traders. Few factories 
have authority to sign trade contracts directly with 
foreign firms. Beijing prohibits private enterprises 
and foreign-invested ventures from signing trade 
contracts. 
Commodity-Specific Quotas and Bans. Since Novem-
ber 1988, Beijing has banned imports of a variety of 
consumer goods, including liquor, sodas, and color 
televisions. Beijing has added several minerals, al-
loys, chemicals, and consumer goods production lines 
to the list of prohibited exports in 1989. 
Licenses. Half China's trade is subject to import or 
export licenses. Trade reforms have generally shifted 
issuing authority from central to provincial levels 
without diminishing the share of trade covered by 
licenses. 
Export and Import Pricing. Export prices on finished 
goods are generally set on the basis of international 
prices, rather than domestic costs of production. In a 
dozen product lines, cartel-like export associations 
regulate pricing to ensure that exporters do not cut 
prices to compete for foreign sales. Imports are 
generally sold in China's domestic market at state-
set prices. 
Subsidies. The State provides grants to state trade 
corporations that lose money on export or import 
transactions because of the gaps between China's 
domestic pries and prices in international markets. 
Export subsidies probably amounted to $6-8 billion 
in 1988, equivalent to up to 15 percent of China's 
export earnings. 
Foreign Exchange Controls. Beijing sets the official 
exchange rate for China's nonconvertible currency 
and strictly controls the use of foreign exchange. 
Beijing also requires export corporations to turn over 
to higher authorities most of the foreign exchange 
they earn. Central or provincial authorities monitor 
closely how traders use the portion they are permit-
ted to retain. 
provinces closest to the territory, to ensure they would 
have a steady flow of monetary resources despite 
Beijing's attempts to rein in credit. 
China's trade balance continued to worsen early this 
year. Imports grew five times faster than exports in 
the first five months of 1989; China's trade deficit 
grew from less than $1 billion in the first five months 
of 1988 to nearly $5 billion as of May 1989, according 
to official Chinese Customs statistics. Purchases of 
production materials in short supply domestically?
such as steel, synthetic fibers, and fertilizers?led the 
import surge. Meanwhile, exports apparently lan-
guished because of the slowdown in China's state-
owned industrial sector.

Turmoil Worsens Economic Difficulties 
The new leadership has endorsed a continuation of the 
austerity program, but the social and political turmoil 
that has gripped China since April will make it 
difficult for Beijing to solve its pressing economic 
problems. First, the preoccupation of China's leaders 
with consolidating power, ridding the bureaucracy of 
Zhao Ziyang's supporters, strengthening party con-
trol, and restoring ideological orthodoxy will prevent 
them from formulating new solutions to China's 
economic problems. 
Second, pressures to increase government expendi-
tures and expand the money supply have probably 
grown because of the social unrest. Beijing may 
attempt to increase income subsidies and loans to 
state enterprises enough to ensure that wages of most 
urban workers keep pace with inflation. 
Beijing may also worry that peasants might become 
restive because they are being pressed to grow more 
grain but are having increasing difficulty obtaining 
inputs and payment from a financially strapped gov-
ernment. In a speech in June, Li Peng called for 
greater efforts to solve rural credit shortages that 
have forced state procurement agents to pay peasants 
with IOUs instead of cash. Beijing began issuing 
IOUs in the fall of 1988 when retrenchment-related 
credit restrictions and bank runs caused a shortage of 
funds in rural banks. Chinese press reports have 
claimed that an additional 10 billion yuan will have to 
be provided to local grain procurement stations to 
solve the problem. Officials fear that, if peasants are 
forced to take IOUs again, they might simply refuse 
to hand their grain and other commodities over to the 
state. Beijing apparently hopes to tap local funds for 
most of the money, but these are funds that might 
otherwise have gone for more profitable undertakings 
like investment in rural industry. More likely, howev-
er, given Beijing's difficulty implementing central 
directives at the local level, the funds will come from 
short-term loans from the central bank, which will 
add to inflation. Chinese press reports indicate that, 
as of mid-June, the central bank had already made 
more than 4 billion yuan available for this purpose. 
Pressure for increased government spending may also 
come from China's military. After a decade of declin ? 
ing influence, China's military leaders probably will 
5 
play a larger role in politics and in the economy in 
return for their support for the crackdown in Beijing. 
Military leaders probably will petition civilian au-
thorities to reverse the decadelong decline in the share 
of the budget going to defense. 
Local Resistance Remains 
Beijing's preoccupation with social and political issues 
will accelerate the trend toward economic autarky at 
the local level in China, and increased provincial 
resistance to Beijing's directives will undermine the 
effectiveness of efforts to slow the economy. Local 
governments will probably strongly resist implement-
ing austerity measures in their .own areas, for exam-
ple, by resuming some of the construction projects 
that central authorities cancelled early this year. This 
resistance will be especially strong in wealthy south-
ern provinces, where reform and an open door to 
Western business have yielded significant economic 
benefits. Local governments may also heighten exist-
ing barriers to trade with other parts of China to 
protect their own industries, making it difficult for 
Beijing to implement economic policies consistently 
when authorities turn their attention back to econom-
ic issues. 
Other Pressures To Relax Austerity 
The reluctance of foreign businessmen and govern-
ments to proceed with investment, trade, and techno-
logical exchanges following the crackdown in Beijing 
has also weakened the authorities' ability to imple-
ment the austerity program. For example, since the 
start of the retrenchment program, foreign investors 
have complained that credit shortages have eroded 
their profit margins by cutting their sales within 
China. Beijing may now be forced to expand credit to 
foreign-funded ventures as part of its effort to con-
vince foreign traders and investors that the business 
environment is stable and that they can make money. 
in China. 
For similar reasons, Beijing may have to back invest-
ment commitments made before the crackdown that it 
might otherwise have postponed. China's southern 
coastal provinces apparently signed many contracts in 
the first few months of 1989, hoping to get funds 
either from Hong Kong sources or from the central 
government for the Chinese portion of the projects

Declassified and Approved For Release 2014/03/28: CIA-RDP04T01091R000200210001-3 
before the retrenchment program really took hold. 
Beijing will now have to provide the money itself or 
ease controls on foreign borrowing to keep foreign 
investment levels up tolend credence to its claims that 
business is back to normal. 
Near-Term Economic Problems Mount 
Competing pressures to increase spending will proba-
bly prevent the retrenchment program from bringing 
inflation under control. In urban areas, inflation will 
probably remain above 20 percent through the end of 
1990; nationwide, inflation is also likely to remain in 
double digits for at least the next 18 months. Blanket 
controls on prices could reduce the inflation rate, but 
wouldlail to reduce imbalances between demand and 
supply and would lead to widespread reimposition of 
rationing. Persistent inflation will fuel urban unrest 
by eroding the living standards of a large segment of 
China's workers. Chinese statistics for the first half of 
1989 indicate that the real incomes of state workers 
declined despite a nearly 19-percent increase in nomi-
nal wages and subsidies. Beijing's recent decision to 
force factory workers to purchase government bonds 
has heightened their resentment; many believe they 
are bearing the brunt of the austerity program. 
The retrenchment policies and midyear work disrup-
tions will slow the overheated economy somewhat, but 
will enlarge China's pool of unemployed. Senior Chi-
nese officials have admitted that the slower economy 
will be able to absorb only half of the 10 million 
workers entering the urban labor force this year. 
Increased spending will probably cause China's gov-
ernment budget deficit to grow this year. Beijing will 
probably have to bail out growing numbers of unprof-
itable state enterprises as wider price controls on 
finished goods prevent factory managers from recoup-
ing losses caused by work slowdowns, energy and 
transportation disruptions, and higher wages and bo-
nuses for workers. Expenditures on consumer subsi-
dies, infrastructure development, and?most likely?
defense will also grow. Meanwhile, slower overall 
growth and declining enterprise profits will cause 
government revenues to stagnate. 
Damage to China's Foreign Economic Relations 
The retrenchment program had begun to take its toll 
on exports and foreign investment even before the 
demonstrations; both had been Projected to slow in 
1989 and 1990. The downturn is now likely to be 
much sharper because of the damage to China's 
economic relations with foreign businesses caused by 
the crackdown. Because Beijing started 1989 with 
about $17 billion in foreign exchange reserves, it can 
probably ride out the downturn this year, but the 
problems will increasingly take a toll in the early 
1990s. 
Tourism Will Plummet 
Tourism will probably remain depressed through at 
least the end of the year and possibly into the early 
1990s. Tourism last year earned Beijing $2.2 billion in 
foreign exchange and had been expected to generate 
about $2.5 billion in 1989. Despite robust tourist 
travel in the first half of this year, China will probably 
take in only $1.5 billion from tourism in 1989. 
New Foreign Investment Contracts Will Slow 
Many investors seeking low-cost Asian production 
sites are now looking to other countries, such as 
Thailand, the Philippines, and Malaysia. Moreover, 
investors already operating in China have, by and 
large, shelved expansion plans indefinitely. Hong 
Kong businessmen, who have provided two-thirds of 
China's foreign investment, will probably react espe-
cially sharply; many of the territory's wealthiest 
magnates are scrambling to extricate themselves from 
existing mainland projects while also intensifying 
efforts to get out of projects in Hong Kong before the 
territory reverts to Beijing's control in 1997. Those 
investors that proceed with China projects will proba-
bly focus on short-term investments that involve small 
capital commitments and little investment in machin-
ery and infrastructure. 
For all of 1989, new investment contracts will proba-
bly fall short of the $5.2 billion in new contracts 
signed last year (see table 1). Before the crackdown, 
Beijing might have expected a record $8 billion in new 
contract signings on the basis of the surge in new 
contract signings in the first five months of 1989.

Paid-in investment, which reflects contracts signed in 
1988 and in early 1989, may exceed 1988's level of 
$2.6 billion. 
Foreign investment has a fairly limited impact on the 
country's economic growth in the short run; annual 
inflows are equivalent to roughly 2 percent of domes-
tic investment, and foreign-invested projects last year 
generated only 2 percent of China's industrial output 
and 5 percent of its export earnings. But foreign 
investment has brought in crucial technical and man-
agerial expertise and helped to improve production 
efficiency and quality control, especially in coastal 
provinces, which have drawn 90 percent of China's 
foreign investment. 
Low-Interest Foreign Loans Have Been Postponed 
Indefinitely 
At the request of many of the countries that donate 
funds to international financial institutions like the 
World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, bil-
lions of dollars worth of concessional financing has 
been placed on hold. In addition, Japan and most 
West European countries have delayed promised low-
interest development loans to China pending the 
restoration of social and economic stability. Most of 
these loans would have gone to the energy, transporta-
tion, and telecommunications sectors. Rates on for-
eign commercial loans will probably be raised as 
7 
Investors Reassess the Risks and Rewards of China 
Projects 
Beijing is attempting to salvage its economic relations 
with the West in the aftermath of the crackdown. Li 
Peng has ordered China's 'foreign investment leading 
group" to assure foreign investors that China remains 
open to the outside world. Coastal provinces and 
cities in southern China that have come to rely on the 
infusion of foreign funds, technology, and managerial 
and marketing expertise have also stepped up efforts 
to lure investors back. Along with the inducements, 
Beijing has made veiled threats that China will 
penalize foreign businessmen that pull out of existing 
ventures or halt negotiations on future projects. 
Some foreign businessmen will no doubt be attracted 
by the lower taxes or greater access to China's 
domestic market that Beijing may offer as sweeten-
ers. But many foreign firms had been operating on 
thin profit margins?and even accepting losses?in 
the hope that continued evolution of China's economy 
to a legally based, market-oriented system would 
ensure large profits in the long run. Beijing's crack-
down and subsequent show trials of arrested workers 
and students, however, have probably convinced 
many foreign businessmen that China's political sys-
tem is not stable enough to allow any leaders to 
implement economic reforms consistently or to 
strengthen legal processes. 
These doubts have probably been reinforced by the 
replacement of Zhao Ziyang and many of his allies in 
the leadership with conservative economic planners. 
Uncertainty about the stability of the current leader-
ship coalition after Deng Xiaoping passes from the 
scene probably also adds to caution by foreign inves-
tors. In addition, although profitable niches will 
remain, some potential investors may be deterred by 
a pragmatic assessment of their ability to earn prof-
its, given China's economic problems and the leader-
ship's public commitment to austerity.

Near-Term Outlook for China's Economic Reform Program 
Reform Major Purpose 
Price 
To make the price structure more accu-
rately reflect relative scarcities by al-
lowing selected prices to move to mar-
ket levels. 
Wage To link productivity and wages more 
closely. 
Enterprise 
Bankruptcy 
Stock ownership 
Contract system 
Foreign trade 
Agriculture 
Rural enterprise 
To force management to employ re-
sources more efficiently. 
To cut firms free from central funding 
by allowing up to 50 percent of stock to 
be owned privately. 
To increase managers' responsibility 
for profits and losses by requiring them 
to adhere to financial quotas negotiat-
ed between factories and their supervi-
sory bureaus. 
To encourage exports by allowing ex-
porters to retain a share of their foreign 
exchange earnings; preferential policies 
for coastal export-producing regions. 
To encourage diversified farm output 
by offering farmers contracts for sta-
ples like grain in exchange for subsi-
dized inputs, or the option of growing 
crops not under state control. 
To invigorate rural economy by ab-
sorbing excess farm labor, producing 
consumer goods, and generating tax 
revenues for local government projects. 
Outlook 
On hold as Beijing tries to control 
inflation. 
Likely to continue as Beijing seeks to 
maintain output, but may be watered 
down by the need to continue subsidies 
and worker bonuses regardless of 
productivity. 
Not likely to rigorously enforce bankrupt-
cy law because increased business failures 
would add unemployed workers to the 
already volatile urban population. 
Backed mainly by Zhao, likely to remain 
on hold because conservatives have ideo-
logical objections to private ownership of 
large enterprises. 
Likely to be retained because it ensures 
the central control favored by conserva-
tives; may be adjusted to reduce focus on 
negotiated quotas, faulted for favoring 
certain enterprises. 
Recentralized state control over key ex-
ports and imports in late 1988 and cur-
tailed regional incentives. Could place 
more products under central control, limit 
the number of trade corporations. 
Beijing will probably try to steer agricul-
tural production back to basics and limit 
expansion of nonstaple farm production. 
Beijing has already begun squeezing this 
profitable sector's access to credit and 
hiking its taxes and could also opt to 
channel raw materials to needy state-run 
firms instead of rural enterprises.

banks reevaluate China's creditworthiness given the 
expected drop in foreign currency inflows from tour-
ism, foreign investment, and exports. 
Export Growth May Slacken 
Recently released Chinese statistics suggest that Chi-
na lost up to $100 million in export revenues daily 
during the height of the crisis. Lost earnings probably 
amounted to $1 billion in the first two weeks of June, 
and exports for the latter half of June were slightly 
lower than usual, suggesting that these losses may not 
be made up even though rail lines, ports, and Chinese 
trade offices are back to normal operations. Foreign 
purchasers of Chinese manufactured goods may won-
der if additional worker strikes or slowdowns will 
prevent China from meeting its commitments in the 
future; many are reported to be investigating other 
sources for the textiles, toys, and other labor-intensive 
light industrial goods they buy from China. Shortages 
of credit and raw materials in China?as well as 
rising input costs?will also slow export growth to 
single digits for the next few years. Exports had been 
growing at nearly a 20-percent annual clip for the last 
four years. 
More Controls on Imports Are Likely 
Beijing's concern that China's foreign exchange re-
serves may drop quickly as a result of the deteriorat-
ing trade balance and sharp declines in tourism and 
foreign investment inflows could lead to additional 
controls on the use of foreign exchange for imports. 
Although grain and agricultural inputs will very likely 
remain exempt, Beijing will almost certainly tighten 
controls over items like consumer goods that are not in 
the annual import plan. Beijing might also curtail 
purchases of industrial equipment and scarce raw 
materials to conserve foreign exchange, even though 
reduced purchases of these items would probably slow 
industrial and export growth in the early 1990s. If 
China experiences a foreign exchange crunch, it may 
increase barter trade with the Soviet Union and 
Eastern Europe. In particular, Beijing might increase 
purchases of raw materials it imports from the Soviet 
Union, like fertilizer, iron and steel, and nonferrous 
metals?some of which it now uses hard currency to 
purchase from Western suppliers. It might also in-
crease purchases of Soviet heavy industrial and pow-
er-generating equipment, which some Chinese leaders 
consider more suited to Chinese conditions than that 
available from Western suppliers. 
9 
Outlook for Reform 
In speeches since the crackdown Deng Xiaoping has 
reiterated his commitment to pursue economic re-
form. The main elements of Beijing's market-oriented 
reform program, however, have been stalled for al-
most a year. Such key reforms as price decontrol and 
bankruptcy are likely to be postponed indefinitely 
because Beijing does not want to add to its problems 
by implementing measures that would raise prices or 
swell the ranks of the urban unemployed. Experi-
ments with stock ownership in state enterprises?
implemented by Zhao Ziyang over the strong ideolog-
ical objections of hardline leaders?are certain to fall 
by the wayside. 
Under the guise of austerity, the hardliners may try to 
chip away at market reforms, clamping down on 
previously decontrolled prices and exerting closer 
central control over some collective and private enter-
prises that compete with state factories for raw 
materials. They may even restrict the ability of state 
enterprises to sell overquota production at market 
prices. Hardliners, however, can turn back the clock 
only so far. Local officials would strongly resist efforts 
by Beijing to reclaim financial and planning author-
ity. In addition, efforts to roll back reform would be 
strongly resisted by Deng Xiaoping, who views rapid 
reform-driven growth in the last decade as one of his 
major accomplishments. 
Without further reform, however, China will be un-
able to alleviate the imbalances in its economy. 
Without price reform, for example, Beijing will con-
tinue to have problems boosting grain production, 
encouraging development of energy and raw material 
resources, and stimulating exports of labor-intensive 
manufactured goods rather than scarce resources. 
Without additional enterprise reforms, industrial effi-
ciency and labor productivity will lag, and Beijing will 
experience difficulty encouraging enterprises to make 
responsible decisions regarding capital investments 
and salary and bonus increases. Continuing economic 
problems will stoke social and political unrest in the 
1990s.

Appendix A 
Economic Performance in 1988 
and 1989 by Sector 
Industrial Performance 
Industrial production rose at a breakneck pace of 
almost 21 percent in 1988 (see figure 2). State-sector 
industrial production rose about 13 percent; the col-
lective and private sectors grew 29 percent and 46 
percent, respectively. Foreign-funded enterprises dou-
bled their industrial output. 
This rapid growth intensified China's energy deficit. 
Overall energy production climbed about 4 percent in 
1988. Although production of electric power grew 9 
percent last year, electric power shortages idled fac-
tories for several days each week. Output of coal and 
crude oil increased only 4.5 percent and 2 percent, 
respectively. Transportation bottlenecks compounded 
the energy shortage by delaying deliveries of coal?
which accounts for more than 70 percent of China's 
energy supply?from mines in the northeast to power 
plants in southern and eastern China. Rapid growth 
also intensified shortages of key raw materials. Steel 
production, for example, increased only 5 percent in 
1988. 
Although industrial output grew at an 11-percent 
annual rate through June?about half last year's 
rate?sharp increases in input prices at the end of 
1988 caused the profits earned by China's state-run 
factories to decline 12 percent. Moreover, imbalances 
between overall industrial growth and the production 
of energy and raw materials persisted. Energy produc-
tion grew at a 5-percent annual rate in the first four 
months of 1989, and output of raw materials actually 
fell. 
China's Energy Minister called this year for easing 
the energy crunch by increasing state investment in 
hydroelectric and nuclear power and in crude oil and 
natural gas extraction. Even if China's financially 
strapped government can come up with the funds for 
these projects, however, it would take years for in-
creased energy production to come on line. 
11 
Agriculture and the Rural Economy 
The value of China's agricultural output increased 
about 3 percent in real terms in 1988. Most of the 
increase was accounted for by expansion of sideline 
industries, like poultry and fishery operations, and a 
sharp increase in the production of cash crops such as 
tobacco and silk. Grain production fell 2 percent last 
year to 394 million metric tons, 16 million short of 
target (see figure 3). As a result, China imported 15 
million metric tons of grain?primarily from Canada 
and the United States (see figure 4). 
Rural industry and commerce are among the most 
dynamic segments of the Chinese economy and since 
1987 have accounted for more than half the value of 
rural output (see figure 5). They currently employ 
more than 85 million people, about 15 percent of 
China's labor force. 
After last year's fourth consecutive disappointing 
harvest, a broad spectrum of China's leadership 
agreed that, without redressing long-term problems, 
the stagnant farm sector could prove a major stum-
blingblock to overall economic development. Premier 
Li Peng called agriculture the "weak link" of China's 
economy in his keynote address to the National 
People's Congress this spring, underscoring agricul-
ture's fall from grace as a symbol of reform success. 
To address the problem, this year Beijing has: 
? Raised producer prices for government-contracted 
grain, cotton, sugar, and oil-bearing crops and 
agreed to purchase over-quota commodities at mar-
ket, rather than lower, state-set prices. 
? Recentralized the distribution of fertilizer, pesti-
cides, and plastic sheeting used as mulch and agreed 
to supply more of these inputs at favorable prices to 
peasants who grow grain.

increased investment by setting aside a portion of

enterprises and on production of nonstaples. 
Beijing also will continue to tinker with reform experi-

reportedly will open a wholesale grain market to 
establish an institutional framework for domestic 
grain trade. In general, however, China's new conser-

rather than strengthen the role of markets in guiding

US-China Trade 
In 1988 China was the United States' 13th-largest 
trading partner. The United States, in turn, was 
China's third-largest trading partner, ranking behind 
Hong Kong and Japan and ahead of West Germany 
and the Soviet Union. According to US Commerce 
Department statistics, US exports grew a robust 44 
percent over 1987 levels, and for the first time 
exceeded $5 billion. Imports from China increased by 
more than one third to $9.3 billion, and the US deficit 
widened almost a fourth to $4.2 billion (see figure 6).

US exports to China last year benefited from strong 
Chinese demand for agricultural products and inputs 
(see table 2). US exports of grain were triple the 1987 
level. Plastic sheeting, fertilizers, and pesticides also 
posted healthy gains. US exports to China will proba-
bly continue to show fairly strong growth in 1989; 
even if Chinese purchases of industrial machinery and 
timber decline as a result of the curbs imposed on 
capital construction, demand for grain and agricultur-
al inputs is likely to remain strong. In the first five 
months of 1989, for example, US exports to China 
increased 30 percent over the same period in 1988; 
sales of grain, raw cotton, aircraft, and fertilizers 
showed especially strong growth. 
Last year manufactured goods accounted for 85 per-
cent of US imports from China. Toys, sporting goods, 
radios, small electrical appliances, and travel goods 
have grown especially rapidly (see table 3). Textiles 
and apparel accounted for one third of China's US 
sales, but growth slowed to single digits last year, 
largely because of disruptions resulting from the

decentralization of China's trade sector. Newly em-
powered exporters in China's interior rushed to earn 
foreign exchange by selling raw cotton, silk, and 
wool?thereby curtailing supplies available to Chi-
nese garment manufacturers. At the same time, cut-
throat pricing tactics by Chinese exporters meant that 
increases in the volume of exports were not always 
matched by increases in foreign exchange earnings. 
US Commerce Department statistics through May 
1989 indicate that recentralization of trade has en-
abled China to boost growth in its earnings from 
textiles and apparel sales to the United States back to 
double digits; the most rapidly growing export prod-
ucts remain household electrical appliances, radios, 
and footwear. Consequently, the US trade deficit is 
likely to grow again this year, and will probably 
exceed $5 billion by yearend.

Sino-Soviet Economic Relations 
Sino-Soviet trade grew 27 percent last year to almost 
$3.3 billion (see figure 7). Chinese statistics for the 
first half of 1989 indicate even stronger growth, with 
Chinese imports surging 63 percent and exports up 12 
percent over a year earlier. Trade along the Sino-
Soviet border was the most dynamic aspect of bilater-
al trade last year, increasing exponentially to account 
for nearly 10 percent of total Sino-Soviet trade. 
Border trade will continue to grow in 1989. China's 
border provinces have enthusiastically embraced it 
because they lack easy access to other markets. 
Moreover, it frees Beijing from having to subsidize 
purchases of Soviet goods to induce Chinese enter-
prises to accept them. 
The scope of Sino-Soviet economic relations broad-
ened last year to include some-new forms of 
cooperation: 
? Chinese laborers began working on projects in the 
Soviet Union under compensatory-trade arrange-
ments that generally exchange Chinese labor ser-
vices for a percentage of the goods produced. Over 
8,000 Chinese workers are already in the Soviet 
Union with at least 5,000 more to follow this year 
under labor agreements signed in 1988. 
? Joint ventures?particularly those combining Soviet 
raw materials and equipment with Chinese labor?
are actively being pursued; the first are likely to 
begin operations this year. 
? Both sides agreed to swap branch offices of their 
foreign exchange banks, and Moscow provided more 
than $400 million in trade-related credits in the 
form of low-interest government loans payable in 
goods and services. For the first time, the Bank of 
China participated in a syndicated loan?valued at 
$50 million?for a Soviet bank. 
Moscow and Beijing are unlikely to be successful in 
expanding the range of economic relations significant-
ly beyond their current levels despite the boost provid-
ed to bilateral relations by Gorbachev's visit to China 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2014/03/28: CIA-RDP04T01091R000200210001-3 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2014/03/28: CIA-RDP04T01091R000200210001-3 
this spring. Beijing will probably continue to favor 
Western technology, and Chinese trading companies 
will prefer to sell their output in the West for hard 
currency. Chinese imports of goods such as timber 
and fertilizer, where the quality of the Soviet com-
modity is comparable to that available elsewhere, will 
probably grow this year as Beijing turns to barter to 
conserve foreign exchange. 
Although labor exports will continue to grow over the 
next year, the Soviet Union probably is reluctant to 
have too many Chinese laborers within its borders. 
Cooperative projects, particularly in the energy and 
heavy industry sectors, hold the greatest potential for 
expanded economic relations, especially if foreign 
investment from Hong Kong and the West slows, as 
anticipated. 
The State Budget and Spending Priorities 
China's government budget deficit grew almost 50 
percent in 1988 to reach $9.2 billion (see figure 8). 
Rapid growth in subsidies was largely responsible for 
the sharp increase. Indeed, rising raw materials prices 
caused losses of state enterprises to climb almost 27 
percent last year. 
Beijing financed the deficit by issuing domestic bonds, 
taking on greater foreign debt, and printing money. In 
1988 the government covered about 38 percent of its 
deficit by selling treasury bonds domestically and 
financed an equal amount through foreign loans. It 
made up the rest with central bank overdrafts?the 
equivalent of printing money. 
Although China's deficit is low by international stan-
dards?it equaled about 2.5 percent of GNP in 
1988?leaders are concerned about its rapid rise 
because it is adding to inflationary pressures and 
because it is increasing China's foreign indebtedness. 
Moreover, it is a political problem for reformers; 
many of China's conservative leaders view any level of 
government deficit as an indication of economic mis-
management and could use it as one additional argu-
ment for holding off on reforms. 
Beijing is trying to solve its deficit problem by 
increasing tax rates, widening its tax base, and im-
proving collection efforts. As the austerity drive slows

the economy, however, growth in tax revenues is likely 
to slow also. Meanwhile, since inflation has not yet 
abated, budget subsidies will continue to skyrocket. 
Thus, China's deficit this year will grow, probably 
exceeding $10 billion. 
Defense Spending 
China releases statistics on national defense spending 
as a line item in the annual state budget but provides 
neither a definition of the categories of expenditure 
included in the figure nor a breakdown of the total. 
Our estimates of Chinese defense expenditures cover 
spending for investment (primarily weapon procure-
ment); operating expenses (including maintenance and 
personnel costs); and research, development, testing, 
and evaluation (RDT&E). Using a building-block 
approach for valuing the costs of these various compo-
nents, we estimate that China's total defense expendi-
tures for 1988 were roughly 45 billion yuan, more 
than twice the announced figure. At current exchange 
rates, this is equivalent to $12 billion.

Despite the difference in absolute values, China's 
announced figures and the CIA estimates both show 
declining trends in the defense sector's share of 
China's budget as well as in the size of the defense 
budget relative to GNP (see figure 9). CIA estimates 
indicate that defense expenditures accounted for 
about one-fourth of China's total budget in 1978, but 
less than one-fifth of the budget in 1988. Moreover, 
we estimate China's defense spending dropped from 
10 percent of GNP in 1978 to only 4 percent in 
1988?somewhat less than the 6 percent for the 
United States and significantly less than the 15 to 17 
percent for the Soviet Union. 
China has cut military spending by slashing personnel 
costs. Beijing has reduced its armed forces by about 3 
million men since 1978, with most of the cuts coming 
from its ground forces. We believe China's military 
operating budget?nearly half of which goes for 
17 
323021 8-89 
salaries?has declined by about one-fifth since 1978. 
Beijing has nearly completed its force reduction, but 
we believe that it may take several more years before 
demobilized men find civilian jobs and are moved 
from military posts. Expenditures on weapons pro-
curement also declined about 10 percent in the last 
decade because Beijing has postponed major pur-
chases until more technologically advanced weapons 
systems are available. We estimate that RDT&E 
expenditures have increased about 25 percent since 
1978, although this category continues to account for 
only about one-eighth of China's defense spending.

Appendix B 
How Reliable are Chinese 
Statistics? 
Official Chinese statistics often provide useful indica-
tors of the direction and magnitude of economic 
growth even though collection techniques are crude 
and local leaders sometimes deliberately fudge data. 
Although local officials may be more hesitant to 
report unfavorable economic information in the wake 
of recent social unrest in China, during the decade of 
reform, Beijing has vastly improved the quality of its 
data by introducing more sophisticated sampling and 
estimative techniques. Moreover, the scale of its effort 
has grown: China's State Statistical Bureau (SSB) 
currently employs more than 1 million full- or part-
time workers. 
The reliability of Chinese statistics varies according to 
the category of data. Some data series?such as 
unemployment?are so tainted that they are virtually 
unusable. In rural areas, there is a tendency to count 
all adults of working age as employed, a remnant of 
past practices of classifying all adults as working 
members of the commune. But rural reforms over the 
last decade have moved as many as 100 million 
peasants from farm work to other occupations, and 
Chinese statistics may not accurately tally the num-
ber gainfully employed in small rural factories and 
service trades, nor account for China's large "floating 
population" of peasants who have been unable to find 
work, many of whom have migrated to urban areas. 
Moreover, the SSB does not account for the fact that 
many Chinese are employed, but do little or no work. 
By one estimate, one-third of state-sector employees 
do not contribute to production. Consequently, official 
statistics exaggerate the size of China's work force, 
understate its unemployment problem, and make it 
impossible to assemble labor force statistics that are 
reliable in the Western sense. 
Another problem with Chinese statistics is that for 
many years Beijing collected data within the context 
of socialist doctrine, which dictates that productive 
labor is transformed only into material goods. Conse-
quently, statisticians did not report adequately on 
nonmaterial sectors such as education, passenger 
19 
transport, public health, banking, and government. 
Although scholars have since filled these data gaps, 
problems remain regarding the completeness of fig-
ures on nonmaterial services where reporting systems 
are still relatively underdeveloped. These sectors com-
pose a small portion of GNP, but they are the fastest 
growing sectors of China's economy and their mis-
measurement could become a problem in the future. 
Broad measures of macroeconomic performance such 
as total social product and national income are useful 
indicators of economic change, although some compo-
nents are suspect. For example, many rural regions do 
not distinguish between real and nominal values of 
output, which inflates growth rates. Beijing also cal-
culates constant price indexes in terms of a 1952 price 
base, which produces higher growth rates than would 
result if researchers used more recent base years that 
more accurately capture China's current economic 
structure. Nonetheless, these forces tend to act on the 
data in a uniform manner so that the general series 
provides a suitable gauge of the level of general 
economic activity. 
Beijing's inflation measures are also flawed, but use-
ful, indicators of the domestic economy. China's price 
indexes may underestimate the impact of inflation, 
which, according to official estimates, vaulted to 
almost 20 percent last year. China's two most fre-
quently cited price indexes are the general retail price 
index and the urban consumer price index. The 
former index is based on data from 12,380 shops and 
markets in urban and rural areas, and the SSB derives 
weights for this index from surveys of urban and rural 
household incomes and expenditures. Researchers 
separately calculate the urban consumer price index, 
which includes the costs of urban services. Although 
the SSB estimates these measures of inflation using 
internationally accepted sample survey techniques, we 
believe the indexes may understate inflation for two 
reasons. First, numerous regions obtain their price 
data from statistical reports submitted by shop owners 
who, because they face pressure from Beijing if their 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2014/03/28: CIA-RDP04T01091R000200210001-3 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2014/03/28: CIA-RDP04T01091R000200210001-3 
prices rise too sharply, may underreport their price 
increases. Second, the market basket the SSB uses to 
represent consumer buying patterns changes very 
slowly and is too heavily weighted with state-con-
trolled goods. As Beijing has liberalized the economy, 
consumers have bought an increasing share of their 
goods on free markets at prices that exceed state 
levels. We report Chinese estimates of inflation, how-
ever, because they provide good qualitative indicators 
of price trends. Official statistics, for example, indi-
cate that the inflation rate nearly tripled in 1988. 
In some instances, we have sought to improve on 
official figures with our own estimates. For example, 
we are developing an estimate of China's gross nation-
al product (GNP) to correct some of the distortions 
inherent in China's official GNP numbers. Chinese 
GNP figures may not precisely gauge all sectors of 
China's economy; state controls, for example, skew 
relative prices and prevent the price structure from 
reflecting underlying market costs. The methodology 
we employ estimates GNP on the basis of an 
input/output model of the Chinese economy. The 
model is composed of 21 sectors, which are aggregat-
ed into three main sectors?agriculture, manufactur-
ing, and services. The methodology generates total 
output estimates for each sector priced according to 
Chinese currency, transforms them into US dollar 
amounts by means of sector-specific dollar/yuan price 
ratios, then sums these data to obtain an estimate of 
Chinese GNP in US dollars. 
We have estimated the cost of Beijing's national 
defense effort by a comparable process. We break the 
defense program down into its fundamental elements, 
calculate the cost of each part, then aggregate the 
individual costs. We begin by identifying the activities 
and physical components that constitute China's de-
fense program for a given year and group them 
according to investment, operations, and research and 
development. Then we compare each activity or physi-
cal component with its most similar US counterpart to 
obtain an estimate in US dollars. This estimate 
reflects US production technology, prices, and profit 
margins, but incorporates the characteristics of the 
Chinese equipment. We take into account differences 
between US and Chinese production technology by 
considering different wage rates and prices of input 
materials. To create a cost estimate in yuan, we 
convert the dollar cost estimates using a series of 
conversion factors developed by comparing Chinese 
and US prices. 
We also adjust the data China's Finance Ministry 
releases on the state budget deficit to bring it more in 
line with Western accounting practices. Beijing's 
,-methodology, which counts foreign borrowing and 
domestic sales of Chinese treasury bonds as "revenue" 
items, tends to understate the central government's 
debt obligations. Correcting the problem provides a 
more accurate measure of the budget's financial 
burden. For example, the Chinese calculated their 
deficit in 1988 at $2.2 billion, less than one-quarter of 
our estimate of $9.2 billion. 
Notwithstanding the potential problems with Chinese 
data, we frequently report official statistic. Chinese 
leaders probably base decisions on the official data 
that is released publicly. Although leaders undoubted-
ly receive confidential reports on economic perfor-
mance, on the whole, the government probably does 
not have a separate data set that is markedly more 
accurate than the information released by the SSB.
