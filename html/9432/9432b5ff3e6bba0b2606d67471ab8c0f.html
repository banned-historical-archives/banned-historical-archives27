 In Laos, the Communists continue to apply some pressure against

 Violence by Japanese leftist students on "Okinawa Reversion Day"
 drew strong condemnations from the press and political parties. Major
 newspapers called on the authorities to take whatever action is necessary to
 eliminate this threat to public order. Although these excesses have further

 VI ETNAM
 The majority of the enemy's
 combat forces in South Vietnam con-
 tinue to refit and resupply,         appar-
 ently for a "May Action Phase" that
 has been forecast by a number of
 sources.   Despite a lack of wide-
 spread large-unit actions,  the
 enemy has mounted several sizable
 attacks in I and III Corps as well
 as sporadic shellings of allied po-
 sitions, occasional small-unit
 probes, interdiction of important
 roads, and small-scale harassing ac-
 tivities.
 The Communists were hit hard
 early this week in fighting west
 and north of Saigon.   At least 230
 enemy troops were killed,  compared
 with one American wounded, during
 an enemy assault on a US fire-sup-
 port base near the Cambodian border.
 Several other skirmishes in III
 Corps accounted for more than 160
 enemy killed,  again with only light
 allied casualties.
 Enemy-initiated ground fight-
 ing picked up in northern I Corps
 this week.   One significant battle
 took place just south of Khe Sanh
 when an estimated 150 enemy troops
 attacked a US mechanized unit.
 Thirty-four Communists were killed
 and 200 antitank rocket rounds and
 500 satchel charges were captured.
 American losses included five killed
 and 34 wounded.
 There was also an increase in
 terrorist and sapper attacks in
 Saigon, many apparently aimed at
 the city's electrical power system

 Political Developments in
 South Vietnam
 President Thieu's proposed,po-
 litical confederation has made some
 progress in working out organiza-
 tional questions but the new group
 has still not been able to attract
 several of South Vietnam's more sig-
 nificant political groups.
 t e poli-
 ticians have gone a ong with Thieu's
 ideas of forming a loose political
 confederation that could later be
 made into a more tightly knit or-
 ganization.   This confederation will
 have a presidium composed of rep:-
 resentatives from all the member
 organizations that will serve as an
 advisory body,  but President Thieu
 { will make the final decisions.
 The politicians have agreed to
 join Thieu despite their disappoint-
 ment over the President's unwilling-
 ness to reward their support with
 appointments to high government
 positions.   Thieu is apparently
 promoting his confederation on the
 ground that it will become the only
 progovernment political party,  and
 that it will take the lead in com-
 bating the Communist political chal-
 lenge.

 COMMUNISTS INCREASE PRESSURE MODERATELY IN LAOS
 The Communists are applying
 some pressure against government
 positions in northeast Laos, but
 otherwise the military situation
 continues relatively quiet.
 North Vietnamese and Pathet
 Lao troops hit the government
 guerrilla base at Bouam Long three
 successive nights last week but
 were unable to drive the defenders
 from the area.
 this may be the beginning
 o     push that has been antici-
 pated since the Communists cap-
 tured Na Khang almost two months
 ago.
 The enemy is still reacting
 cautiously to the government's
 counteroffensive south of the
 Plaine des Jarres, but there are
 signs that as many as three Pathet
 Lao battalions may have recently
 moved into the area.   The counter-
 offensive has caught the enemy off
 guard and has helped raise the
 morale of government forces;  it
 has not, however,  achieved its
 principal objective of forcing
 the enemy to divert troops from
 operations in northern Xieng
 Khouang.
 In the northwest, government
 troops have reoccupied the Mekong
 River town of Pak Beng, which the
 enemy had captured in early April.
 Government forces hold a number
 of outlying defense positions but
 elements of two Pathet Lao bat-
 tal:Lons dug in on the surrounding
 ridgelines continue to threaten
 the town.

 CHINESE COMMUNIST CONGRESS REFLECTS CONTINUING IMPASSE
 The Chinese Communist Party's
 ninth congress adjourned last
 week after naming a new central
 committee.   The composition of
 this body, and of the politburo
 "elected" at its first plenary
 session, shows that no single
 interest group in Peking has yet
 managed to win a decisive vic-
 tory, and reflects the existing
 balance of forces within the Chi-
 nese communist leadership.   Al-
 though the congress legitimized
 the political situation that has
 prevailed in China since late
 last summer, its unexpected length
 suggests that the delegates en-
 gaged in wide-ranging debate on
 a variety of disputed personnel
 and policy issues.
 One sign of the continuing
 impasse is the failure,  for the
 first time in party history,  to
 reveal the relative standing of
 members of the politburo.   In-
 stead, the 25 members are listed
 in the Chinese equivalent of
 alphabetical order, except for
 Chairman Mao Tse-tung and Vice
 Chairman Lin Piao, who head the
 list.   The five-man standing com-
 mittee, composed of Mao, Lin,
 and three others,  leaves it un-
 clear whether Chou En-lai retains
 his traditional number three spot.
 The remainder of the new
 politburo reflects the balance
 between newly important military
 men and Maoist radicals who have
 been closely associated with the
 Cultural Revolution.   Some of the
 military members were severely
 Page 6
 criticized early in the Cultural
 Revolution.   The presence of mili-
 tary leaders--from both the Peo-
 ple's Liberation Army central
 headquarters and the provincial
 military regions--signals an at-
 tempt to legitimize the army's
 role in the party and attests to
 the army's importance in running
 the state.   A major surprise in
 the new politburo is the absence
 of most of the central government
 ministers who served in the pie-
 vious politburo.   This may indi-
 cate some diminution of Chou Hn-
 lai's influence, but it is too
 early to be sure of this.
 In short, this politburo,
 like the congress, seems to be
 a reflection of the stalemate
 that has persisted in China for
 some time.   It indicates a gen-
 eral withering of the normal ad-
 ministrative machinery of the

 because no consensus could be
 reached on important questions.
 The prime policy issues dis-
 cussed in detail were the vexing
 question of how to deal with of-
 ficials criticized during the Cul-
 tural Revolution and the need
 for renewed attention to increas-
 ing production.   On both these
 matters, Lin took a moderate
 stance.   Regarding personnel, he
 prescribed the "rehabilitation"
 of large numbers of cadres;  this
 may mean that a considerable num-

 be restored to their posts.   Lin
 was exceptionally strong in his
 praise for the army, calling it
 the  "pillar of the state."

 of the Cultural Revolution are
 clearly over, there is no real
 sign that the congress marks a
 return to pragmatic normality.

 CAMBODIA PLANS RENEWED RELATIONS WITH THAILAND
 Phnom Penh is moving ahead

 Cambodia's initiative appears
 to be part of Prince Sihanouk's
 current effort to widen his diplo-
 matic options by adopting a more
 balanced neutrality.   Moreover,
 Sihanouk is increasingly concerned
 over the military threat along his
 eastern border with South Vietnam,
 and no doubt would like to ease
 tensions along the Thai border,
 where a substantial part of Cam-
 bodia's security force is now
 stationed.
 Although substantive dif-
 ferences between the two countries
 are minimal,  a number of minor
 issues,  including personal ani-
 mosities between Sihanouk and Thai
 Deputy Prime Minister Praphat,
 will have to be kept in check if

 NORTH KOREA SEEKING FOREIGN SUPPORT ON PLANE INCIDENT
 Pyongyang has shown increased
 frustration over its failure to
 obtain foreign support for its
 version of the shootdown of the
 US reconnaissance aircraft.
 North Korea's limited foreign
 propaganda probably is related to
 the lack of international support
 its version of the incident has
 received.   During the week, the
 regime began prodding its allies
 and friends to back publicly its
 claim that the US aircraft was
 shot down after it had violated
 North Korean airspace.
 Moscow's first editorial
 comment on the incident finally
 Page 9
 appeared on 27 April, after the
 US naval task force had left the
 Sea of Japan.   The editorial
 claimed that the "Soviet people"
 condemned the "dangerous actions"
 of the US in the Korean area.
 This comment, which is the closest
 the Soviets have come to a clear
 endor=sement of North Korean ac-
 tions, probably was stimulated by
 Pyongyang's urgings.
 Only one broadcast from
 Pyongyang during the past week
 attempted to exploit the shoot-
 down.   Pyongyang radio on 24 April
 focused directly on Japanese fears
 of being dragged into a new Korean
 conflict because of the Japan-US
 security treaty.   The statement
 criticized the Japanese Govern-
 ment's support of the US reaction
 to the incident as "openly taking
 a hand in moves for the provoca-
 tion of a new war in Korea."
 Pyongyang has as yet made no com-
 ment on the removal of the US
 naval task force from the Sea of
 Japan.

 ECONOMIC STAGNATION FRUSTRATES NORTH KOREANS
 Premier Kim Il-song has
 taken the extreme step of com-
 mitting his personal prestige on
 reviving the sluggish North Ko-
 rean economy.                     Kim apparently be-
 lieves the economy must support
 increased military power as well
 as overcome the unfavorable con-
 trast with the rapid economic de-
 velopment taking place in South
 Korea.   Civilian economic needs
 appear to be a secondary consid-
 eration and are being met only
 on the atsterity level.
 As the economy probably has
 been supporting a near-maximum
 military burden for many years,
 it is doubtful that military ex-
 penditures can climb rapidly in
 the future unless the size of the
 economy increases.   -Pyongyang has
 said that military spending has
 been consuming about 30 percent
 of the national budget during the
 past two years.
 Although these figures can-
 not be taken at face value, there
 is no doubt that military spend-
 ing has been very heavy.   The
 Pueblo and EC-121 incidents,
 furt e-rmore, may have induced
 more spending than was planned.
 On 24 April, North Korea announced
 that defense expenditures will
 increase 11 percent this year,
 an action that may be connected
 with the EC-121 shootdown.
 In seeking to foster faster
 economic growth, Kim has publicly
 argued with his economic advis-
 ers, who claim that  "diminishing
 resources" make an annual rate
 of growth of six or seven per-
 cent the best that can be ex-
 pected.   Kim believes that a
 socialist country can achieve
 continuous growth rates of 15
 to 20 percent annually.   Under-
 scoring this assertion,  the press
 has dubbed it one of the "per-
 fect Marxist-Leninist answers"
 that Kim's "genius" has provided
 to "break entirely new ground in
 socialist economic theory."
 In actuality, North Korea's
 rate of growth is estimated to
 have averaged less than 5 percent
 annually in the 1960s.   South
 Korea's growth rate overtook
 North Korea's in 1962 and reached
 13 percent in 1968, or about
 three times the North Korean
 rate last year.   North Korea's
 sensitivity to comparisons with,
 the South is reflected in Pyon-
 yang's economic reports, which
 regularly devote up to half their
 space to disparaging the South
 Korean economy.
 North Korea would have per-
 formed better in this decade if
 Soviet aid--the bedrock of the
 1961-67 plan--had not been cut
 off in the early 1960s because
 Pyongyang sided with China in
 accusing the USSR of using aid
 to control other countries.   In
 lieu of Soviet aid,  the North
 Koreans have sought to promote
 growth by a series of administra-
 tive improvements, such as reorgan-
 izing ministries, revamping the
 planning process, and recasting
 control organizations in the
 countryside.   Although these
 measures have not been particu-
 larly successful, Kim continues
 to prescribe the same treatment.

 Frenchmen accepted president De Gaulle's departure with composure;
 the chaos that he had predicted did not appear. Elsewhere in Western
 Europe, there were some misgivings, but the dominant reaction was one of
 relief and new hope for European unity.
 Moscow broke sharply with its May I)ay tradition in an effort to
 advance a "peaceful image." The military section of the parade was canceled,
 and party chief Brezhnev, rather than the defense minister, gave the principal
 address. The speech was conciliatory, placing primary emphasis on disarma-
 ment, easing of international tension, and peaceful cooperation. It specifi-
 callyendorsed "peaceful coexistence." Brezhnev did not mention either the
 US or China, but it is probably a sign of Moscow's thinking that the anti-Mao
 placards carried in the parade out-numbered the anti-American ones.
 In Czechoslovakia, Husak's firm initial moves toward orthodoxy appear
 to have brought about a period of uneasy calm characterized for the most
 part by a popular mood of hopelessness, frustration, and watchful waiting.
 Last week, Husak met with his Eastern European counterparts during the
 four-day CEMA summit meeting in Moscow, and-except for the East
 Germans-seems to have won their support.
 Continued student unrest in Yugoslavia and the possibility of demon-
 strations are causing concern in official circles. Belgrade was alarmed enough
 to have precipitously postponed the long-scheduled visit in early June of
 Indonesia's President. Regime leaders fear that the presence of the anti-Com-
 munist leader could lead to an outburst of disorders on the first anniversary
 of last year's riots. Student dissatisfaction centers on the government's
 failure to deliver on its promises to reorganize university education and to
 improve employment opportunities for graduates.
 Politburo rapporteur Honecker--Ulbricr.t's right-hand man-speaking to
 the tenth plenary session of the East German party's central committee this
 week revealed that there will be no change in East Germany's hard-line
 policy toward Bonn. Official alarm was evident over continuing domestic
 economic and ideological problems.                                           25X1

 FRANCE CALM AS LEADERS PREPARE FOR PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS
 Contrary to De Gaulle's
 prediction on the eve of the
 abortive referendum that "shocks"
 and "upheavals" would follow his
 departure, France has remained
 calm in the week following his
 resignation.   Political leaders
 have spent the week jockeying
 for position in the presidential
 race, which most observers expect
 to take place on 1 June.   Several
 candidates have their hat in the
 ring already, including the former
 Gaullist prime minister, Georges
 Pompidou,  and the moderate Social-
 ist mayor of Marseilles, Gaston
 Defferre.
 Pompidou,  the front runner,
 is making significant headway in
 his effort to win over essential
 support from the center and from
 those in the Gaullist camp who
 defected in the referendum.   The
 decision of Independent Republican
 leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing--
 who broke ranks with the Gaullists
 over the referendum and later im-
 plied he could not support the
 candidacy of his former cabinet
 boss--to rally to the Pompidou
 banner may well prove to be the
 critical factor in Pompidou's
 drive for election.   According
 to centrist leader Pierre Sudreau,
 Pompidou offered Giscard a top
 post in a future government.
 together hold almost 100 seats in
 the 487-seat National Assembly,
 one persuasive argument probably
 was that Pompidou's election would
 make the election of a new parlia-
 ment unnecessary.  Any presidential
 successor other than a Gaullist
 might find it necessary to dis-
 solve the present assembly, in
 which almost three fourths of the
 seats are held by Gaullists and,
 their allies.
 Pompidou is further aided
 the fact that both the left and
 the center are badly divided.
 Gaston Defferre, who hopes to ap-
 peal to that broad spectrum from
 the left to the center which lifs
 between the Communists and the
 Gaullists, has complicated the
 task of those who want to come up
 with a generally acceptable cen-
 trist candidate or a single can4i-
 date of the left.   One result of
 Defferre's announcement has been
 to lessen the likelihood that in-
 terim President Alain Poher, who
 also hoped for center-left support,
 would put forth his candidacy.
 Defferre's candidacy has
 dealt a sharp blow to the Commu-
 nist Party, which is now railing
 against a center-left coalition
 and calling instead for a joint
 Communist-leftist candidate
 The
 .
 Pompidou's efforts to culti-                   party would prefer not to run its
 vate the center also appear to be                   own candidate because standing
 bearing fruit.   Sudreau said that
 the leader of the centrist parlia-
 mentary group, Jacques Duhamel,
 is virtually "on board the Pompi-
 dou train."   For both centrists
 and Independent Republicans, who
 alone would not only symbolize a
 "redescent into the ghetto" but
 might also reveal that the party,
 in fact, commands less votes than
 it traditionally claims.

 EUROPEANS RELIEVED BY DE GAIJLLE'S DEPARTURE
 The West Europeans have re-
 ceived the news of De Gaulle's
 resignation with some apprehen-
 sion, but more noticeably with re-
 lief and renewed hope for European
 unity;  there has been almost no
 expression of regret.   Officials
 for the most part have commented
 discreetly,  leaving the more force-
 ful national reactions to the press.
 Some concern has been regis-
 tered about the prospects for a
 smooth transition to a new French
 leadership and for future French
 political stability.   There is
 more worry about the stability of
 the franc over the long term and
 the impact on other currencies of
 a devaluation.
 The predominant reaction, how-
 ever, has been relief at the depar-
 ture of a man whose ideas and style
 of governing were uncongenial to
 his European partners.   It is
 widely conceded that Gaullism did
 not go out with the general, how-
 ever, and it is not believed that
 his successor will abruptly alter
 France's course.   Nevertheless,
 possibilities are seen for a more
 positive French policy toward Eu-
 rope and NATO.
 Italian Foreign Minister Nenni
 expressed the opinion that a new
 dialogue on Europe was about to
 open with France.   The Italian
 press, exultant over the change,
 pointed to the timeliness of the
 Anglo-Italian declaration on Eu-
 ropean unity issued on 28 April.
 Page 13
 In the West German press,ex-
 pectations for the future of Europe
 were generally reserved but hopeful.
 Foreign Minister Willy Brandt said
 that he hoped "the coming period
 will make it possible to strive for
 new progress in European policies."
 Moscow has betrayed some dis-
 comfiture over De Gaulle's resigna-
 tion.   Izvestia praised him for
 having provided an alternative to
 "Atlanticism"  and expressed hope
 that the  "realism" of French foreign
 policy will not depart with him.
 The Soviets have been at pains to
 stress that the defeat for De Gaulle
 should not be construed as rejec-
 tion of his rapport with Moscow and
 his show of independence from the
 US and NATO.
 The current pre-election period
 in France may be a trying time for
 Moscow.   The USSR has put consider-
 able diplomatic effort into build-
 ing a special relationship with
 France and will not gamble these
 gains on the long shot of a Commu-
 nist share of power in a new French
 government.   Although the Soviets
 will support the electoral bid of
 the French Communist Party, they
 will use caution in attacking those
 whose chances of governing are bet-
 ter.

 CZECHOSLOVAK LEADERS MEND FENCES ABROAD, CLAMP DOWN AT HOME
 Party first secretary Husak
 last week garnered support for
 his new regime from most of his
 conservative Soviet bloc counter-
 parts, an important step that
 will help him establish greater
 control in Czechoslovakia.
 During his visit to Moscow
 last week to attend the CEMA
 summit, Husak met separately with
 the party bosses of each of the
 invading powers, as well as with
 Rumania's Ceausescu.   The import
 of these meetings was to make
 clear that he will base his rule
 on Soviet power and the Warsaw
 Pact, but also that he expects
 to have some leeway in his for-
 eign relationships.   As if to
 underscore these points, while
 Husak was in Moscow, other Czech-
 oslovak delegations were sent to
 resume contacts with both hard-
 line and more liberal Eastern
 European regimes.
 Husak's trip to Moscow--his
 first since becoming party chief--
 precipitated rumors that he and
 Brezhnev had worked on a schedule
 for the withdrawal of Soviet oc-
 cupation troops from Czechoslo-
 vakia.   There is, however, no
 reliable information to this ef-
 fect.   There may be token with-
 drawals, but Moscow is unlikely
 to consider a major reduction of
 its occupation forces or to com-
 mit itself to a firm timetable.
 A Czechoslovak expert on Soviet
 bloc affairs, commenting on a pos-
 sible Soviet withdrawal, said that
 it would be a smart move from the
 Soviet point of view, but he doubts
 they are that smart.
 Czechoslovakia's new party chief Gustav Ilusak (hatless) and Premier Cernik are met at Moscow Airport by Soviet leaders
 Brezhnev and Kosygin.

 The Czechoslovak leadership
 also took steps last week to re-
 duce the corps of Western cor-
 respondents in Prague, to impose
 new restrictions on the press,
 and to discourage further united
 action by the students by declar-
 ing their parliament "illegal."
 To avoid potential trouble, the
 annual May Day parade in Prague
 was called off and celebrations
 were restricted to easily con-
 trolled district and factory
 meetings.    As a result, May
 Day--a trigger for youthful dis-
 sidence in the past--passed with
 only scattered anti-Husak or
 anti-Soviet incidents.
 Husak's firm initial moves
 have brought about a period of
 uneasy calm, characterized to a
 large extent by hopelessness and
 frustration, but also by a grow-
 ing public curiosity inspired
 by the new party leader's repu-
 tation as an ardent nationalist
 and a victim of Stalinism.   Husak
 received,  for example, an un-
 expected boost from the still
 outspokenly liberal youth daily,
 Mlada Fronta, when its editor-
 in chief' lauded his capabilities.
 There are many people, how-
 ever,  as yet unreconciled to
 Husak's ascendancy,  as is evi-
 dent in acts of vandalism, the
 refusal of the national students'
 organization to join the Commu-
 nist-dominated National Front,
 and in a notable number of resig-
 nations from the Communist Party.
 Some party organizations, espe-
 cially in northern Bohemia, have
 withheld their endorsement of
 Husak until they judge how far
 he intends to go.

 4F.C RE`I'
 EAST GERMANS TO MAINTAIN HARD-LINE POLICIES
 Politburo rapporteur Erich
 Honecker's speech before the
 tenth plenum of East Germany's
 party central committee on 28
 April made clear not only that
 Pankow is unprepared to change
 its hard line toward Bonn but
 also that the leadership is
 alarmed about continuing domestic
 economic and ideological problems.
 Honecker lashed out at West
 Germany, and its Social Democratic
 Party in particular, charging
 Bonn with increasing tension and
 preventing progress on European
 security,   and the Social Demo-
 crats with betraying West German
 workers.   He repeatedly asserted
 that diplomatic recognition of
 East Germany was an absolute con-
 dition for European security and
 also reiterated other long-stand-
 ing--and unacceptable--demands
 on Bonn that were contained in
 the Budapest appeal of the War-
 saw Pact.
 Honecker confirmed that
 East Germany favors closer polit-
 ical and military integration of
 the Warsaw Pact countries,  and
 that it continues to have reserva-
 tion about the new Czechoslovak
 leadership.   His remarks suggested
 that Pankow also does not fully
 concur with the draft document
 that is to be discussed at the
 forthcoming international Commu-
 nist conference.
 Honecker devoted half of his
 speech to criticism of the party's
 economic apparatus, stating that
 party members were "persistently
 impatient" over continued produc-
 tion difficulties and other short-
 comings.   His disparagement of
 "convergence theories,"  "reform-
 ers," and "revisionists" was di-
 rected to his domestic audience,
 rather than to the Czechoslovaks,
 and indicated  the  party's con-
 tinuing concern over cultural and
 ideological deviations.   Honecker's
 speech and remarks by other party
 officials suggest that the party
 intends to take further steps
 to ensure ideological conformity
 and to maintain tight control of
 the economy.

 CEMA SUMMIT MEETING ACCOMPLISHES LITTLE
 The eight CEMA countries
 failed to agree on any immediate
 reforms of the organization at
 their long-heralded summit meet-
 ing that ended on 26 April.   Al-
 though the session probably was
 held at this time to avoid a con-
 tinuing display of political dis-
 unity, disagreement on economic
 integration was evident through-
 out the meeting.
 The focus of the conference
 was on the narrow issue of the
 development of intra-CEMA trade
 and financial relations.   The
 member states plan to intensify
 these relations at a time when
 their share of trade with the
 free world apparently has passed
 its peak.   The participants de-
 cided to establish an investment
 bank to finance specific projects
 and to work out improvements in
 CEMA's existing International
 Bank for Economic Cooperation.
 Unless substantial progress is
 made in solving problems of prices
 and currency convertibility, how-
 ever,  the proposed investment
 bank will not be able to play an
 effective role.
 If new methods were devised
 to lead to meaningful economic
 cooperation,  they were not an-

 tion.   In the past, CEMA has been
 most successful in technical
 areas--such as a railway freight-
 car pool--because these efforts
 avoid. the political controversy
 caused by conflicts of national
 economic interests.

 of economic integration.   Ruma-
 nia's Ceausescu again stated that
 his country "resolutely opposes"
 any integration within CEMA that
 would restrict the sovereignty
 and economic autonomy of member

 members, a prospect that is long

 WINTER GRAIN OUTLOOK BETTER IN EASTERN EUROPE THAN USSR
 Prospects for the winter
 grain harvest are mediocre in
 the Soviet Union but relatively
 good in Eastern Europe.   Although
 winter grains usually account
 for about half of the USSR's
 bread grain production,  in East-
 ern Europe they constitute
 roughly 90 percent of the total.
 Winter grain crops in the
 USSR were seeded on about 39 mil-
 lion hectares last fall, slightly
 less than in the previous year.
 Fall sowing weather was good,
 precipitation was well above
 normal in most regions, and good
 fall growth was reported.   In-
 tense cold and inadequate snow
 cover during the winter, however,
 heavily damaged fall-sown grains
 in parts of the Ukraine, the cen-
 tral black soil zone,  and the
 northern Caucasus.
 Although the damage appar-
 ently was not as widespread as
 initially reported,  it will re-
 quire significant reseeding with
 spring grains, which generally
 have a lower yield.   A vigorous
 press campaign is currently under
 way urging farmers to reseed with
 corn because of its alleged higher
 yield, particularly in the south-
 ern areas.
 under a three-year agreement with
 Canada.
 Current prospects for the
 important winter grain crops of
 Eastern Europe--wheat, rye, and
 barley--are relatively good,al-
 though not as favorable as a year
 ago when bread grain production
 in this area set a new record.
 Throughout Eastern Europe, winter
 grains were sown later than usual
 because of delayed harvesting of
 fall crops and rainy weather.
 Soil moisture was sufficient for
 germination but freezing temper-
 atures began before good root de-
 velopment and snow cover could
 afford protection from winter-
 kill.   The weather last winter
 was more severe than in 1967;68.
 Soil moisture levels as of
 1 April were near normal through-
 out Eastern Europe and were bet-
 ter than a year ago in the Bal-
 kans, but a cold, snowy March
 prevented the timely seeding of
 spring grains and retarded growth
 of winter grains.   Normal precip-
 itation and warm temperatures
 during the late spring months
 could significantly improve yield
 prospects because both the area
 sown to higher yielding wheat and
 allocations of fertilizer in-
 creased except in Czechoslovakia.
 Barring further setbacks in
 growing and harvesting both win-
 ter and spring grains,  the USSR
 should be able to meet its ex-
 port commitments to Eastern Eu-
 rope, Cuba, and certain free
 world countries.   Nevertheless,
 the Soviets may elect to purchase
 at least a portion of the four
 million tons of wheat remaining
 Eastern Europe's demand for
 imported grain in fiscal 1969 is
 expected to approximate the 6
 million tons of a year ago.   Im-
 ports of grain from the free
 world may reach the lowest level
 in a decade, however, as the'USSR
 will be supplying over 75 percent
 25X1
 of the area's needs this year.

 ALBANIA PLEDGES SUPPORT FOR YUGOSLAVIA AND RUMANIA
 In an article in the party
 daily Zeri I Popullit of 11 April,
 Albania pledged support to Yugo-
 slavia and Rumania in the event
 of Soviet aggression.  This con-
 trasts sharply with the vitupera-
 tion Tirana has heaped on the
 Yugoslavs for most of the last
 20 years and seems designed to
 take advantage of the community
 of anti-Soviet feelings in Yugo-
 slavia and Rumania to score propa-
 ganda points against the USSR.
 Tirana stammered in the
 wake of the invasion of Czecho-
 slovakia last summer, apparently
 undecided how to treat its old
 antagonist, Yugoslavia, which
 was vociferously condemning the
 USSR.   The indecision was ap-
 parent even last month when the
 Yugoslav party congress--normally
 a prime target for Tirana's ti-
 rades--met without drawing any
 Albanian commentary.   Probably
 with Peking's acquiescence if
 not approval, Albania clearly
 has not decided to shunt aside,
 if only temporarily, its dif-
 ferences with Yugoslavia in view
 of the common fear of the Soviet
 Union.

 Albania  has sent a delegation

 While softening its approach

 Bulgaria's role in the Czecho-
 slovak intervention and to accuse
 Sofia of being the "Kremlin's
 mouthpiece."   Albanian-Bulgarian
 relations have been bitter since
 last July when Bulgaria threw
 out Albania's ambassador and most
 of his staff for "illegally" dis-
 tributing Marxist-Leninist prop-
 aganc:a.
 The Rumanians have tried to
 remain on good terms with Albania
 since it broke with the Soviet

 Tirana has set Bucharest apart
 from its criticism of the Warsaw

 COMMANDO ACTIVITY SHARPENS MIDDLE EAST STRIFE
 The political situation in
 Lebanon remains unresolved, a
 government-fedayeen clash may be
 shaping up in Jordan, and Israeli
 commandos raided upper Egypt.
 In Lebanon, President Hilu
 has failed in his attempts to
 find a successor to Prime Minis-
 ter Rashid Karami, who resigned
 on 24 April.   Karami's resigna-
 tion came in the wake of two
 days of clashes between Lebanese
 security forces and demonstra-
 tors from Palestinian refugee
 camps who were protesting the
 government's recent moves to re-
 strict fedayeen activities in
 southern Lebanon.   Seventeen
 people were killed and over 100
 injured in incidents in Beirut,
 Site of serious
 civil disturbance
 Tyre, Tripoli, Sidon, Baalbek,
 and Nabatiyyah.  A four-day state
 of emergency and the imposition
 of curfews in the six cities did
 much to quiet the situation.
 Hilu decided to move against
 the f' 'edayeen after their rate of
 infiltration into Lebanon from
 Syria increased sharply during
 the last of March and early April.
 He apparently saw this as his
 last chance to stand up to the
 terrorist groups before they be-
 came too powerful to control.
 As the number of fedayeen grew
 larger, the general staff had
 become increasingly pessimistic
 about the army's ability to keep
 them in check.
 In his resignation speech
 on 24 April, Karami noted that
 the issue of what action the gov-
 ernment should take regarding
 the fedayeen was dividing the
 country.   He and other Muslim
 political leaders have told Hilu
 that there must be a national
 consensus on future fedayeen pol-
 icy before they would be willing
 to participate in the government.
 Meanwhile, leaders of Fatah
 and the Palestine Liberation Or-
 gani;,ation  (PLO), meeting in Bei-
 rut early this week, apparently
 decided not to exacerbate the
 situation any further for the
 time being.
 This may be no more than a tac-
 tical move, however, to gain them
 a little breathing time before
 their next move.

 In Jordan,  the Palestinian

 the chances of a major clash be-
 tween the commandos and the re-
 ime.
 The fedayeen, already appre-

 are some indications that feda-

 neutral in any future clash.   The
 growing tension is illustrated by
 an incident between fedayeen and

 in Amman in which five persons
 died in an abrupt exchange of
 fire.
 Incidents along the Arab-

 POLITICAL ACTIVITY PICKING UP IN PAKISTAN
 Political activity in Pakistan
 is on an upturn, highlighted by
 President Yahya Khan's recent meet-
 ings with opposition political
 leaders.  Meanwhile, the new gov-
 ernment has announced proposed re-
 forms in its continuing efforts to
 win the support of labor and stu-
 dents.
 On 22 April, President Yahya
 Khan, kicking off a political fact-
 finding tour, told reporters in
 Lahore that he hoped to appoint a
 new chief election commissioner
 soon and predicted "early" elec-
 tions.
 As of     Apri  , he had avoided
 meeting with leftists and extrem-
 ists in West Pakistan, or with
 Maulana Bhashani, one of the most
 important political figures in the
 eastern wing.
 Meanwhile, West Pakistani op-
 position leaders Nasrullah Khan and
 Asghar Than visited Dacca and, with
 the apparent approval of the gov-
 ernment,  investigated prospects for
 forming a new nationwide  political
 party.   This proposed organization
 reportedly would include conserva-
 tive East Pakistani elements opposed
 to a loosening of ties between the
 two provinces and would exclude the
 only two significant parties in
 the East wing, Mujibur Rahman's
 Awami League and Bhashani's Na-
 tional Awami Party/Left.   This ef-
 fort appears doomed as it is un-
 likely to find much support among
 the Be
 ngalis.
 Mujibur Rahman, emerging from
 almost
 a month of relative seclu-
 sion,
 April
 gave a press interview
 in which he dismissed
 on
 talk
 22
 of any union between East Pakistan
 and the Indian state of West Ben-
 gal.   He affirmed that he was pre-
 pared to discuss with the new gov-
 ernment those aspects of his six-
 point political program which
 seemed unsatisfactory to the mili-
 tary, including the degree of au-
 tonomy for East Pakistan, but not
 his demand for division of West
 Pakistan into four provinces, which
 is opposed by powerful Punjabi ele-
 ments in the military.
 Deputy Chief Martial Law Ad-
 ministrator Nur Khan has been meet-
 ing with labor heads, school ad-
 ministrators,  and student leaders
 in anticipation of recommending
 reforms.   On 25 April, he presented
 outlines for a new labor policy
 that would include guarantees of
 the right to strike as well as min-
 imum wages.  Following a number of
 sessions with teachers and student
 leaders, Nur Khan proposed the ba-
 sis for a new educational policy
 providing greater participation
 by students in university affairs,
 more emphasis on scientific and
 technical training, and maximum
 autonomy for universities.   Such
 reforms could answer many of the
 grievances that contributed sig-
 nificantly to the unrest prior to
 the imposition of martial law.

 PERSIAN GULF FEDERATION EFFORT UNDER STRAIN
 Recent statements by Brit-
 ain's Conservative Party leader
 Edward Heath have complicated the
 situation in the Persian Gulf area
 at a time when local rulers are
 still moving slowly to make their
 federation something more than a
 paper entity.
 In a trip to the gulf area
 in early April, Heath announced
 his party's intention to reverse
 the present Labor government's
 decision to terminate Britain's
 military presence there.
 The announce-
 ment has already drawn fire from
 the Iranians and several radical
 Arab states, however.   It could
 have even more harmful conse-
 quences;  should the Saudis place
 too much reliance on the prospect
 that Britain will remain, they
 will be less motivated to perse-
 vere in the delicate business of
 cooperating with the Iranians.
 In addition, Britain's origi-
 nal decision to leave had taken
 some of the wind out of the sails
 of the gulf's proliferating sub-
 versive groups.   With the over-
 riding issue of Israel effectively
 distracting the Egyptians,  Syri-
 ans, and Iraqis, the absence of a
 flammable anti-imperialist cause
 has helped keep the area rela-
 tively tranquil.   A reversal of
 the decision now, or even the
 widespread conviction that such
 a reversal was in the works, could
 provide new fuel for incendiary
 radicals.
 Meanwhile, the rulers of the
 Federation of Arab Amirates and
 its subordinate councils continue
 their periodic and inconclusive
 meetings, bedeviled by the key
 problem of the Iranian claim to
 Bahrain.   Time and again, the
 skeikhdoms have backed away from
 a scheduled meeting in Bahrain
 out of fear of Iran's reaction--
 most recently in the case of the
 next rulers' meeting slated for
 25 May.   The Bahrainis are disil-
 lusioned at the lack of support
 for them, and now seem to be try-
 ing to force the others into a
 public and definitive acceptance
 of Bahrain as a full and equal
 member of the federation.   They
 have seized on the recent tour of
 gulf states by a high-powered
 Iraq_ delegation to press their
 case.

 As leaders of many Latin American nations gather in Bolivia for the
 funeral of President Rene Barrientos, killed in a helicopter accident, an early
 unconstitutional change of government in that country seems increasingly
 likely. Vice President Siles was allowed to assume the presidency immedi-
 ately following Barrientos' death, but armed forces Commander in Chief
 Ovando has been pressing demands to gain de facto dominance of the
 government. He may be satisfied only with Siles' resignation or ouster.
 The Velasco government in Ecuador is also under growing pressure
 from many sources. The latest in a series of cabinet resignations is that of
 Defense Minister Andrade, who had been under attack from young officers;
 Government Minister Larrea probably will be the next to go. Velasco is hard
 put to find competent replacements, and if congress fails to adopt measures
 to finance the unbalanced national budget before adjournment on 4 May, a
 fiscal crisis could further weaken his position.
 In the Caribbean, Trinidad's Prime Minister Williams is facing a rare
 challenge in the form of a nationwide strike by the Transport and Industrial
 Workers Union. The union hopes to secure abolition of legal restrictions on
 labor's right to strike in addition to wage increases. The government is
 considering declaring a state of emergency.
 The Castro regime, on the other hand, has received an unusual display
 of support from the leadership of the Cuban Catholic Church. All top
 members of the hierarchy joined in a pastoral letter denouncing the US
 economic denial policy toward Cuba. In all likelihood, the statement re-
 sulted from pressure from Castro, who continues to be frustrated by eco-
 nomic failures.
 Tension between Costa Rica and the military regime in Panama is
 building up to the point where Costa Rica may again break relations or
 appeal to the Organization of American States. A break precipitated by the
 military coup in Panama last October ended only two months ago. The Costa
 Ricans are incensed at repeated. border incursions by the Panamanian Na-
 tional Guard in search of antijunta insurgents, and over the shabby treatment
 accorded the chief of the Costa Rican Civil Guard when in Panama City to
 discuss outstanding problems.

 INSTABILITY IN BOLIVIA AFTER BARRIENTOS' DEATH
 The death of President Bar-
 rientos in a helicopter crash on
 27 April has removed an important
 element of stability from the Bo-
 livian political scene.   Luis
 Adolfo Siles Salinas, who as vice
 president constitutionally suc-
 ceeded Barrientos,  lacks any broad
 political support.   Armed forces
 Commander in Chief Alfredo Ovando
 probably would have won the pres-
 idential election scheduled for
 May 1970.   It now appears, how-
 ever,  that Ovando is unwilling to
 wait that long,  and he may move
 to oust Siles very soon.
 Ovando met with Siles on 29
 April and presented him with a
 list of demands including selec-
 tion of certain cabinet officers
 by Ovando, a nationalistic policy,
 and guaranteeing Ovando's elec-
 tion in 1970.   Siles refused to
 agree to all these demands because
 to do so would have made him a
 puppet president.   The two men
 agreed to postpone a final deci-
 sion until 2 May after Barrientos'
 burial.  Mutual dislike between
 Siles and Ovando exacerbates thg
 situation.   Ovando has a low opin-
 ion of Siles, and Siles believes
 that Ovando would usher in a "bla-
 tant military dictatorship" even
 if he were elected constitution-
 ally.
 Pressure is building on Gen-
 eral Ovando to move quickly.   The
 powerful Bolivian National Peasjnts
 Confederation  on 30 April called
 for Siles'  immediate resignation,
 and as many as 25,000 to 30,000
 anti-Siles peasants were expected
 to be in Cochabamba for Barrientos'
 burial.

 CONCERN EXPRESSED OVER VENEZUELAN PACIFICATION EFFORTS
 pposition to the manner in
 which President Caldera is try-
 ing to bring an end to almost
 seven years of insurgency in Ven-
 ezuela is crystalizing in some
 political and military circles.
 High-ranking military offi-
 cers are quite concerned over the
 government's recent actions that
 legalized the Communist Party
 (PCV)  and freed a number of im-
 portant extremist leaders.  More-
 over, the government's ready ac-
 ceptance of an offer by the car-
 dinal archbishop of Caracas and
 other prominent individuals to
 mediate between the rebels and
 the government is looked upon as
 giving the insurgents a respecta-
 bility and publicity they had not
 previously enjoyed.  Army offi-
 cers complain that the government
 does not bother about the inter-
 ests of the junior officers still
 on the alert in the field who
 have battled the insurgents for
 years with no such publicity.
 They resent the fact that their
 success in reducing insurgency
 to its present low ebb may be can-
 celed by political compromises
 DIA     the government may have to make
 in order to achieve its goal of
 25X1     a cease-fire.
 President Ca   era has been quiet ly
 sounding out officers of all the
 services regarding their attitudes
 on recent government moves toward
 accommodation with the PCV and the
 guerrillas.   These opinions have
 reportedly revealed enough con-
 cern to warrant a second look by
 the government at what it is
 doing and at the vigor with which
 some of its pacification programs
 are being advanced.
 Although  government  of-
 ficials insist that the insur-
 gent" will be ruthlessly sup-
 pressed if they reject their
 proposals, there i8 a general feel-
 ing in the military that the Cal-
 dera administration will not carry
 its warnings through.   Officials
 of the opposition Democratic Ac-
 tion Party are also taking a hard
 look at the government's actions
 and are exploiting the military's
 concern.
 An additional irritant to the
 military is the possibility that
 thei   share of the budget--an
 austere 8.5 percent--may have to
 be reduced even further if the
 government is going to meet cur-
 rent operating expenses.  There
 is considerable grumbling among
 air force and naval officials,
 who may bear the brunt of the
 cuts.   The air force chief of
 staff has complained that pro-
 jected cuts will prevent the ac-
 quisition of new aircraft this
 year and will force a halt in
 construction of the new air force
 headquarters.   The navy is also
 faced with the necessity of find-
 ing money to meet expenses al-
 ready obligated.
 Although military concern
 has not reached the point where
 it is a threat to the government,
 military leaders can be expected
 to keep a close watch on further
 moves by the new administration.

 PERU'S INTERNAL PROBLEMS GROW
 Minister of Interior Artola
 and the witch hunt he is leading
 against former officials of the
 Belaunde government have become
 the primary targets of those op-
 posed to Peru's Velasco adminis-
 tration.   Many respected former
 officials have been forced to seek
 asylum in various embassies or
 exile in other Latin American
 countries.
 Until recently,  the opposition
 press had been forced to support
 the Velasco government in its con-
 frontation with the US or run the
 risk of being charged with treason
 but now it seems to have found an
 issue on which it can criticize
 the government.   General Artola has
 so far borne the brunt of this for
 his seemingly exaggerated charges
 of corruption against well-liked
 people.   The criticism, however,
 is indirectly aimed at the entire
 military government, suggesting in
 effect that the Velasco regime is
 just another repressive military
 dictatorship.
 It is unlikely that this grow-
 ing dissent will seriously affect
 the functioning of the government,
 but there are indications that
 President Velasco is sensitive to
 such charges.   In recent public
 statements, he has made a point of
 appealing for national unity in the
 face of an allegedly serious threat
 from the US.   General Artola is
 one of Velasco's most ardent sup-
 porters, and the President will
 probably keep him on unless he be-
 comes a serious political liability
 In any event, Artola represents a
 convenient scapegoat.
 Meanwhile,  the government is
 keeping the public stirred up over
 the International Petroleum Com-
 pany                                                                         (IPC)  issue, using the con-
 tinuing nationalistic reaction
 to consolidate the military's
 hold.   There are indications
 that some government leaders would
 like to avoid the economic conse-
 quences of an imposition of sa: nc-
 tions by the US, but it is prob-
 ably politically impossible for
 them to make the necessary com-
 promises.   A ruling on IPC's ap-
 peal to reduce or eliminate the
 company's alleged $690 million
 debt is expected before 6 August,
 but it seems doubtful that the
 ruling will satisfy either the
 com an  or US law,                        25X1

 NEW PURGES MOUNTED IN BRAZIL
 President Costa e Silva appears
 to be having trouble restraining
 Brazil's military hard liners, and
 the prolonged purging process also
 is beginning to cause uneasiness
 among the government's civilian
 supporters.
 On 29 April, the National
 Security Council issued the long-
 est purge list to date, bringing
 to nearly 300 the number of per-
 sons cassated by the government
 since it assumed broader powers
 under an institutional act in De-
 cember 1968.   Over one fifth of
 the federal legislators have lost
 their political rights, including
 many members of the government
 party.  Nearly 42 other persons,
 including 12 diplomats, were
 forcibly retired from the Foreign
 Ministry.
 None of those on the latest
 list were men of significant na-
 tional stature, but their punish-
 ment and the prolonged nature of the
 purging process is beginning to
 cause uneasiness, even among those
 civilians who have supported the
 government's efforts to root out
 corruption.   Moreover, the govern-
 ment's recent summary retirement of
 44 leading educators, many of na-
 tional and some of international rep-
 utation, has aroused widespread crit-
 icism and reportedly has badly shaken
 the scientific community as well.
 It is almost certain to prove a set-
 back to educational reform efforts
 and may well contribute to the "brain
 drain" about which the government
 claims to be worried.
 It seems clear that Costa e
 Silva is not able to resolve the
 differences between hard-line acti-
 vists who want even more widespread
 purges of politicians and more
 moderate leaders who want a return
 to at least some form of constitu-
 tional normality.   The president is
 apparently not strong enough to
 deny the hard-liners' demands, and
 it   seems likely that additional
 purges of political and educational
 leaders will occur.
 COSTA RICAN COMMUNISTS MAKE STRONG BID FOR LEGALITY
 Costa Rica's Communists are
 well on their way toward making
 their party the only legal Commu-
 nist political organization in Cen-
 tral America.
 In December 1968,  the Commu-
 nist front--the Bloc of Workers,
 Peasants, and Intellectuals  (BOCI)--
 petitioned the National Electoral
 Tribunal for inscription as a na-
 tional political party.   The tri-
 bunal has the authority to ban any
 Communist party, but side-stepped
 the issue and referred it to the
 legislature, which reconvened on 1
 May.   The parties represented have
 freed their deputies to vote accord-
 ing to their own conscience, and
 the two thirds vote necessary to
 proscribe the BOCI will be diffi-
 cult to muster.
 The Communists have skillfully
 played on Costa Rican distaste for
 denying rights to minority groups.

 In addition, last year's sale of ex-
 cess coffee to the USSR, negotiated
 by Communist chief Manuel Mora, has
 added to the Communists'  respectabil-
 ity.   Mora, who heads both the
 regular Communist Party and the new
 front, has threatened to resign if
 the BOCI is turned down.   He has
 fostered the idea that his depar-
 ture would give control to revolu-
 tionary extremists in the party.
 An indicator of the Communists'
 effectiveness is that the 600-mem-
 ber party had 21,000 signatures on
 their petition for registration and
 may have up to 15,000 in reserve.
 With even a small representation
 in the next legislature, the Commu-
 nists'  bargaining position would
 be enhanced because no party is
 likely to have a majority.   It is
 also possible, however, that Costa
 Rica's several vigorous Anti-Cdmmu-
 nist organizations, which have so
 far limited their activity to propa-
 ganda in the public media, might in-
 cline toward violence to oppose Com-
 munist intrusion on the political
 scene.
 JAMAICA FACES POSSIBLE CRISIS OVER SUGAR INDUSTRY
 Prime Minister Shearer appears
 headed for a confrontation with
 the Jamaican sugar industry that
 could compound political problems
 already heightened by violence and
 public dissatisfaction.
 The island's largest sugar
 estate, Monymusk has threatened to
 close down at the end of this crop
 season unless the government, which
 controls the price of sugar for
 domestic consumption, grants ma-
 jor concessions to the industry,
 including a guaranteed price in-
 crease.
 Since 1965, the sugar industry,
 which accounts for approximately 30
 percent of total agricultural pro-
 duction, has stagnated; even the
 large producers have been unable
 to show profits.   A two-year drought
 is partially responsible for the
 decline in production, but the in-
 dustry also suffers from high pro-
 duction costs and lack of mechaniza-
 tion.   Several estates have closed
 down, and approximately 4,000 inde-
 Page 3 2
 pendent farmers have been forced
 out of production.
 The Jamaican Government has
 ignored the recommendations of the
 Sugar Inquiry Commission, published
 in October 1967,  to encourage mech-
 anization and greater managerial ef-
 ficiency.   Prime Minister Shearer
 opposes mechanization because he
 fears that unemployment--already 18
 percent--will increase and that the
 skilled labor necessary to handle
 the machines would be organized by
 a union affiliated with his major
 political rival, the Peoples Nab-
 tional Party  (PNP).
 A confrontation now between
 the government and the sugar indus-
 try would add to Shearer's increas-
 ing political problems occasioned
 by the growing strength of the po-
 litical opposition and by an in-
 crease in the already high crime
 rate that has generated some pub-
 lic hysteria.  Michael Manley, the
 PNP leader, has already called for
 significant policy changes to stimu-
 late agricultural development.
