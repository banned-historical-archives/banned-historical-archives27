 SUBJECT:   Dinner Meeting of 9 July 1979
 USSR-EE,                   attended a dinner at Airlie House on
 9 July 1979 in honor of a group of Soviet academicians who
 were attending a conference on Asia and Problems of Detente
 sponsored by the George Washington University Sino-Soviet
 Institute.  Present at the dinner in addition to the Soviets
 were representatives of the host organization headed by
 Dr. Gaston J. Sigur and the President of George Washington
 University, Dr. Elliott, along with a large group of American
 academicians active  in the field of Sino-Soviet relations.
 Following are highlights of the im ressions gained by Messrs.
 Assistant NIO for Special
 Studies, who was also present, is submitting a separate
 memorandum which covers his conversation with Dr. Ivan Kovalenko
 of the Institute for the US and Canada Studies, USSR Academy
 of Sciences.

 political ideology which they had been following for the past

 as being a fairly-solid student of developments in China, and a
 person capable of looking at events without a heavy dose of Soviet
 ideology.   The theme of "great change" came up at several points
 in the conversation, and Baryshnikov mentioned that he had been in
 China (he spoke of.Sinkiang) at.some. point last fall.
 suggested that the Chinese were apparently rejecting much of the
 characterized as representing a "great change."

 6.                   pre-dinner conversation with Dr. Sladkovsky,
 he noted that he had known CCP Vice Chairman Chen Yun as early as
 1926 in Shanghai, where he, Sladkovsky, had been a student and
 Chen Yun a labor leader.   Sladkovsky remarked that he had recently
 written an article on the Chinese economy in the Journal of the
 Institute for the Far East and had received a letter from Chen Yun
 which had commented favorably upon this article.   Chen Yun had
 invited Sladkovsky to visit China.   Sladkovsky appeared to be
 rather pleased at Chen Yun's new position as head of the PRC State
 Council's Financial and Economic Commission.

 7.   Sladkovsky said he had also known Chou Enlai for many
 years, and regarded Chou as a rather weak and vacillating man.
 According to Sladkovsky, Chou had gotten ahead because he had
 never attempted to be more than number 2 or 3 and alsway adjusted
 his position to accord with that of the number 1.   Sladkovsky
 argued.that because of Chou's close identification with Mao Zedong
 during the Cultural Revolution, Chou had been personally
 responsible for the deaths of many Chinese.
 that as we saw it, Chou had used his close relationship withdMao
 to do what he could to hold the country together during that very
 troubled period.   Sladkovsky held that we Americans always
 attribute too much to Chou Enlai.
 8.   Later, during the dinner conversation, Sladkovsky
 expressed doubt that China could achieve its agricultural goals,
 e.g., grain production on the order of 400M tons per annum.  He
 doubted that mechanization could work, or that such a goal was
 even economically desirable given the size of China's rural
 population.   Sladkovsky agreed, however, with the contention that
 an increase in materiel incentives for the peasants would
 stimulate increased agricultural production.
 --- -----J   ++   _?=  11411   ueen  in  Hong  Kong,
 and he replied affirmatively.                                                              i            Icalled attention to the
 energy, initiative, and hard working qualities by the Chinese
 in Hong Kong and suggested that what the present leadership in
 China was trying to do was to stimulate these same qualities on
 the part of the Chinese people as a whole.  .Sladkovsky did not
 dispute this contention.
 10.   Toward the conclusion of the dinner, Dr. Sigur made a few
 brief welcoming remarks.  Dr. Sladkovsky then replied in effect
 calling upon Russians and Americans to look to the future and to
 work toward improved relations.   Sladkovsky was interrupted during
 these remarks by Dr. Kovalenko, who added to Sladkovsky's words
 and evidently wanted to make it obvious to all that he, Kovalenko,
 was the real power in the Soviet delegation and outranked Sladkovsky.

 11.   Meanwhile, according to an account later passed on by
 the American scholar Parris Chang to           Dr. Titarenko, who
 sat next to Chang and harrangued him in Chinese throughout the
 dinner, was intent upon peddling a repetitive message about
 Deng Xiaoping.  Deng, according to Titarenko, was the main source
 of anti-Soviet sentiment in the Chinese leadership, and was
 allegedly opposed on this issue by many Chinese leaders, specifically
 including Chen Yun and Li Xiennien as well as many in the Chinese
 military.  Titarenko, according to Chang, depicted Hua G.uofeng as
 occupying an intermediate position on the Soviet question.

 THE DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE
 National Intelligence Officers
 13 July 1979
 MEMORANDUM FOR:   Director of Central Intelligence
 National Intelligence Officer for China
 SUBJECT           Activities/Events/Trends in China of Possible
 Interest to Policymakers
 1.  Action Requested:  None; this memorandum is for your
 information only.
 2.  Background:   You requested that each NIO address the
 above subject for his area of responsibility at the NIO meeting
 scheduled for Monday, 16 July. I have a long-standing engagement
 outside Washington on that date, and accordingly forward herewith
 the observations I would otherwise have made orally at the NIO
 meeting.
 3.   I believe that there are three aspects of Chinese policy
 and outlook which deserve particular attention:
 a.   The question of continuity within the Chinese
 leadership. Beijing's recently-concluded National People's
 Congress session appeared to endorse much of the program and
 philosophy for national development which we have attributed to
 Deng Xiaoping--heightened pragmatism, separation of the Party
 from management, diminished attention to ideology and the role
 of Mao Zedong, emphasis on democracy (albeit of a "socialist"
 nature) and rule of law, increased material incentives, continued
 concentration on the "four modernizations as China's primary
 task."  Newly-appointed national leaders appear to be supportive
 of this philosophy.
 --  However, Deng Xiaoping himself may have been
 critized for some of his policy initiatives, especially
 with respect to Vietnam, the US, and the USSR.  He has
 said he will make no more foreign visits, and reportedly
 wishes to retire.

 SUBJECT            Monthly Warning Assessment:   China
 1.   The Indochina Situation
 Despite reports of Sino-Vietnamese clashes analysts at
 the 18 July meeting did not anticipate renewed hostilities between
 China and Vietnam in the near term, and noted a considerable
 reduction in Chinese forces adjacent to Vietnam, down to 100,000
 troops and 250 aircraft vs. 200,000 Vietnamese troops.  It was
 suggested, however, that we should check on whether the Chinese may
 have established large supply dumps near the border to permit a
 rapid buildup if and when teaching Vietnam a second lesson is
 decided upon.  Anti-Vietnamese resistance continues in Kampuchea
 sustained by supplies sent via Thailand, and Vietnamese forces are
 also encountering some logistical difficulties due to the weather.
 Vietnam nevertheless still has the military advantage, and as a
 result two Vietnamese divisions may have been withdrawn from
 Kampuchea until after the monsoon.  Analysts did not rate highly
 the prospects for a political settlement in Kampuchea as matters
 now stand.

 an oral briefing.  Both of these steps have already been taken.

 contains an analysis of the status of Deng Xiaoping.  The memorandum
 entitled "China's Military Posture and Modernization" deals in
 general terms with the Chinese response to the Soviet military
 posture along the Sino-Soviet and Sino-Mogolian borders, but does
 not specifically refer to the Soviet military buildup in those
 regions since last March as I reported to you in my latest warning
 memorandum.  I will see that this material is made available to
 the Vice President via Denis Clift within the next few days.

 Geological surveys reportedly had not yet begun as of.
 December 1978.
 This multipurpose project will generate about 6 billion
 kWh per year.  Geological surveys reportedly were under
 way in December 1978.
 The plant will generate an average of 6.5 billion kWh an-
 nually.  Reservoir capacity is to be 12.7 billion cubic
 meters but will be reduced to 3.8 billion by sediment.
 No further details are available.
 Probably the same as a planned 6,000-MW project called
 Binjing on the Yalong Jiang.

 SUBJECT              Monthly Warning Assessment:   China
 1.   The Sino-Soviet Situation
 Analysts reviewed the recent evidence without appreciably
 changing judgments regarding the evolution of the situation.   They
 noted that evidence was accumulating that a sizable faction within
 the ministry of fcreign affairs was in favor of improvement of
 relations, but there was no direct evidence these sentiments were
 shared by top-level officials.   They noted also that preliminaries
 regarding the talks to be held in Moscow in September has not yet
 been completed, and that the Soviets were continuing to increase
 their military force along the border.   On the other hand, they
 took into account                                                  that each
 side was positioning itself for an improvement of relations.   At this
 juncture the bottom line appeared to be that the jury was out and
 the burden of proof remained on those who would argue that some
 improvement of relations was in the cards.   Tacit agreement continued
 that any improvement in relations would be modest and. would take
 considerable time to achieve.
 2.   The Indochina Situation
 Analysts chewed over the available evidence regarding troop
 movements and other indications of increased Chinese military interest
 in the Vietnamese border.   The general consensus was that the evidence

 SUBJECT           Request for an Exception for VNE
 Badge for Michel Oksenberg
 REFERENCE      :  Our Memorandum, dated 29 December 1978,
 Same Subject (NFAC 5903-78)
 1.   As stated in the referenced memorandum, the desirability
 of Michel Oksenberg having a VNE badge remains the same.
 2.   I have checked with Mr. Oksenberg and he assures me that
 he intends to visit the Agency much more frequently in the ensuing
 months.    These visits will be specifically in connection with the
 travel by the President to the PRC next year, the travel in the near
 future to China by a senior Cabinet officer, and the deliberations of
 the NIE on Sino-Soviet (NIE 11/13-79).  Moreover, Mr. Oksenberg wishes
 to maintain a close consultative relationship with the NIO/CH and
 with analysts in various offices of NFAC.  He, himself, will be
 providing political insights and guidance to personnel of this Agency.
 3.   Therefore, it is requested that an exception to the policy
 of restricting VNE badges to people who visit the Agency at least 100
 times per year be made in the case of Mr. Oksenberg.

 FROM           :  James R. Lilley
 NIO/China
 SUBJECT
 Request for an Exception for VNE
 Badge for Michel Oksenberg
 1.  I request that an exception to.the policy of restricting
 VNE badges to people who visit the Agency at least 100 times per
 year be made in the case of Michel Oksenberg.
 2.  I recommend this for the following reasons:
 A close and cooperative arrangement with
 Mr. Oksenberg is essential to members of
 NFAC and DDO.  We anticipate more frequent
 contact with him out here in this building,
 especially during the intense period before
 the arrival of the Chinese leaders in
 Washington on 29 January 1979.
 --  In our view, W. Oksenberg's role relative
 to China is as important as an NFIB member.
 His complete cooperation and candor are
 important ingredients of our work.  Were
 we to deny him the VNE badge and oblige
 him to go for the usual visitor procedure,
 we would lose valuable time, degrade our
 view of him in his eyes, and thus inhibit
 the course of our work with him.
 --  There will, in our view, be an intensifica-
 tion of CIA interest in China over the next
 year, and we are anticipating a good deal
 more contact with Mr. Oksenberg.-

 SUBJECT:              Re-examination of Eligibility to Hold a VNE
 Badge, in.the case of Michael OKSENBERG
 1.  In order to comply with the DCI's desire that
 the number of Visitor,-No-Escort badges in use be
 substantially reduced, action has been taken to limit
 the issuance of new Visitor-No-Escort badges, and to
 re-examine the eligibility of current Visitor-No-Escort
 badge holders.
 2.   The criteria governing the issuance of a
 Visitor-No-Escort badge are contained in paragraph ib,
 which state--,  in part,  that "the number of
 za   visits to the Agency by a visitor must total at
 least 100 per year, or-extraordinary protocol considerations
 must be involved, e.g., visits by NFIB members."  It is
 our intention to strictly interpret the 100 visits a year
 criterion, and to eliminate "protocol considerations" as
 justification for issuance of Visitor-No-Escort badges
 except under the most extraordinary circumstances.
 visit frequency criterion is not met-by a Visitor-No-Escort
 badge holder, the sponsoring office will be requested to
 retrieve the badge and return it to the Office of Security.
 Our records show-that the subject person entered the
 Headquarters Building  3 time(s) from 1 January 1979 until
 30.June 1979.
