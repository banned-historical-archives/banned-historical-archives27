 MAJOR DRV, PRG LEADERS DUE TO APPEAR AT SAIGON VICTORY FETE
 Media evidence suggests that in the next few days high-ranking
 PRG/NFLSV leaders will at last make their first public appearance
 in Saigon since its conquest and probably use the occasion for
 their first authoritative speeches outlining postwar communist
 policies for the South.  This is suggested by announcements on
 festivities to celebrate the communist takeover scheduled to
 begin 15 May, and the planned first public visit to Saigon by a
 high-level DRV delegation.  The PRG/NFLSV leadership clearly
 will have every reason, including protocol requirements, to
 welcome the DRV delegation with a PRG/NFLSV leadership turnout
 of comparable stature.
 The DRV party-government delegation, announced by Vietnamese
 communist media on 14 May as having departed for Saigon, includes
 DRV President Ton Duc Thang and Vietnam Workers Party (VWP)
 Politburo members Le Duc Tho, Le Thanh Nghi, and Van Tien Dung.
 Hanoi radio's account of the DRV delegations departure noted
 that it was seen off by VWP Politburo members Truong Chinh and
 Pham Van Dong.  No mention was made of VWP First Secretary
 Le Duan or Defense Minister Vo Nguyen Giap, both of whom are
 last known to have appeared at Hanoi's May Day celebrations.
 The celebrations in Saigon which the North Vietnamese delegation
 will attend are part of delayed victory ceremonies proclaimed
 throughout Vietnam that will precede by a few days the 19 May
 anniversary of Ho Chi Minh's birthday.  The festivities were
 announced in "decisions" by DRV and PRG authorities broadcast on
 the 10th by Hanoi and the Front radios.  The PRG decision was
 the first authoritative public PRG pronouncement on developments
 in South Vietnam since the war's end on 30 April.
 The DRV and PRG decisions on the victory celebration followed a
 VWP Secretariat directive of the 5th, released on the 7th, that
 announced a celebration was to be held without indicating its
 timing.*  While the undated DRV decision was ascribed to the DRV
 premier and was "in accordance with" the earlier VWP directive,
 the 8 May PRG announcement was issued as a decision of the PRG

 Council of Ministers and signed by its chairman, PRG President
 Huynh Tan Phat.  According to the PRG decision, the Council of
 Ministers met on the 7th, but no details of the meeting's
 agenda were disclosed.  Since January 1972, PRG Council sessions
 have followed a pattern of meeting twice a year--in winter and
 summer--and have customarily been followed up with a communique
 describing the proceedings.
 According to the PRG decision, "a grand. ceremony" is to be held
 "in all localities of South Vietnam for a period of three days,
 from 15 to 17 May," during which time military and government
 personnel are to be released from work.  The PRG decision also
 made special note that those who "previously served in . . . the
 puppet Saigon army and admJ.nistration, as well as foreigners"
 would be allowed to participate.  At the same time it cautioned
 those who might "harbor schemes or commit acts of sabotage against
 the celebrations" that they would be "severely punished."  The
 briefer DRV decision only designated the 15th and 16th as
 "official holidays" for the celebration.
 CONYJNISTS TIGHTEN CONTROL IN SAIGON, WARN "REACTIONARIES"
 Saigon radio has continued to report communist efforts to impose
 control over the city and has broadcast accounts of "people's
 revolutionary committees" being established at the precinct
 level.  While the overall impression conveyed by the media is
 one of order and acquiesence by the citizens, there are indica-
 tions that some persons are refusing to fully cooperate and in
 some cases are taking advantage of what must be the initial
 confusion of the sudden communist takeover.
 The Saigon-Gia Dinh Municipal Military Management Committee,*
 headed by Lieutenant General Tran Van Tra, has been issuing a
 flurry of communiques ordering various categories of residents
 to report to work, supplying detailed information on where
 former Saigon military personnel and GVN officials are to
 register with communist authorities and turn in weapons, and
 establishing registration procedures for foreigners still in
 the city.  In addition, communiques have been broadcast providing
 guidelines on postal and telegraphic services, currency

 regulations, printing and publishing prohibitions, registration
 and collection of firearms and explosives, and the proper
 disposition of real estate abandoned by those who have fled.
 A 12 May military management committee communique prohibiting the
 use of "improperly prepared" flags and insignia indicated that
 "some bad elements" have been impersonating certain officials
 by using flags and armbands to "commit illegal acts against
 public order and security."  An 11 May editorial in the new
 Saigon newspaper GIAI P?TONG, entitled "Develop the People's
 Collective Mastership, Resolutely Track Down and Punish Stubborn
 Reactionaries," had also indicated that some have refused to,
 conform with the communists' efforts at control.  Following an
 essentially conciliatory recapitulation of PRG policy toward
 those who cooperate, the editorial launched into a severe
 condemnation and warning to those "many reactionary and wicked
 elements still remaining" who "in a number of areas .      refuse
 to report, hide weapons, and perform scattered acts opposing the
 revolution . . . or setting up phony revolutionary committees."

 PRG,.DRVAASK THAILAND, OTHER-STATES"TO,RETURN PLANES, ';:SHIPS
 Vietnamese communist media in the past-two weeks have.;issued,,a
 barrage of comment calling upon Thailand, Singapore,.and other
 Southeast Asian nations to return aircraft, ships, , and. cargo
 taken out of South'Vietnam by refugees : fleeing. the communist
 .takeover.  'The PRG stopped issuing foreign. ministry. spokesman
 protests critical of Thailand. after:.6 May, perhaps because it
 had reached,.an,agreement?with.Bangkok.on private.-negotiations.
 A Hanoi broadcast.on.14 May-quoted a LIBERATION. PRESS, AGENCY
 announcement that thePRG Foreign,Ministry had-appointed
 Ambassador Nguyen Minh.Phuong*.to:go to.Bangkok to "take over
 the property",of the former GVN-.embassy.and "retrieve" the South
 Vietnamese ships and..aircraft.
 Hanoi continued, as.l.ate as..13 May to authoritatively criticize
 Thailand;.but.a DRV Foreign'Ministry spokesman's protest on..that
 .date against anti-Vietnamese demonstrations in'Thailand.echoed
 earlier references to the possibility of normalizing relations
 between the two countries.  Hanoi's. posture is consistent-with
 its basic policy..in the months prior to.the communist takeover. in
 South Vietnam, when the DRV.seemed bent on pressuring, Bangkok--
 .through a conditional offer of talks on improving relations--to
 end its cooperation with U.S. policies in Indochina.**  There has
 been no public acknowledgment by the Vietnamese of Bangkok news
 reports on 13 May that Thai Foreign Minister Chatchai Chunhawan..had
 stated that a?DRV delegation. would arrive at the end.of the month to
 discuss bilateral relations.
 The campaign to gain-custody of the planes and ships for the PRG
 began promptly on the heels of the fall of Saigon with the release
 on 1 May of a PRG Foreign Ministry statement, dated 30 April,
 which announced that the PRG is "now exercising its full sovereignty
 in the whole of South Vic;.nam, is the only authentic and legal
 representative of the Vietnamese people, and has full power to
 solve the international affairs of South Vietnam."  The PRG's
 claim to be the only legal authority in South Vietnam was not

 reiterated in a 2 May DRV Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement
 endorsing the 30 April PRG Foreign Ministry statement, nor in
 subsequent official DRV statements; but the claim was echoed in
 Hanoi press comment, including a 2 May commentary in the army
 paper QUAN DOI NHAN DAN.  The PRG also issued a foreign ministry
 statement on the 2d restating its right to property taken out of
 South Vietnam.
 On 3 May Vietnamese media released notes on this issue from both
 the PRG and DRV foreign ministries.  The PRG Foreign Ministry
 note, which was sent to Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines,
 and Singapore, restated the PRG claim to be the only legal South
 Vietnamese representative and mildly requested that the nations
 "help" in
 the
 transfer of the planes and ships to the PRG.  The
 DRV note,
 sent
 only to Thailand, asked that Bangkok respond
 positively
 to
 the PRG and held out the hope that "correct" Thai
 action on
 the
 issue would be "an important contribution to the
 normalization of relations" between Thailand and the DRV and to
 peace in the region.  The possibility of a "quick improvement of
 relations" between Bangkok and Hanoi was raised in a 4 May NHAN
 DAN commentary.  Setting the pattern for later comment, the
 commentary contrasted statements by Thai Prime Minister Khukrit
 Pramot, favoring the return of the planes to South Vietnam, with
 remarks by Thai Defense Minister Praman Adireksan opposing such
 a move.  It observed critically that a number of persons in Thai
 ruling circles want to continue a "reactionary policy."
 Reports that the U.S. aircraft carrier Midway had removed some
 of the South Vietnamese planes from Thailand prompted the next
 official PRG comment, in a foreign ministry spokesman's statement
 on 6 May which condemned the "seizure" by the "Ford Administration"
 and asserted the right to claim all property which had been brought
 into Thailand.  A DRV Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement on the
 same day, by contrast, focused its criticism on the Bangkok
 government, claiming that statements by the Thai Foreign. Ministry
 had accommodated the U.S. "plot" to seize PRG property.  It
 reiterated that transfer of the aircraft and ships to the PRG
 would "serve to benefit the friendly relations between the DRV
 and Thailand."  The DRV spokesman warned that the Thai Government
 must be responsible for "all consequences of its actions" if it
 "colludes with America and permits the latter to forcibly seize"
 the PRG property.
 The Vietnamese were slow in responding to Bangkok reports on the
 6th that Thai Foreign Minister Chatchai Chunhawan had asked the
 United States to halt the removal of weaponry and had sent a cable

 to the PRG ;asking it to .send emissaries.to Bangkok.to .negotiate
 the return of .the 'ships, aircraft, ;and weapons.  A '9 .May 'NHAN
 DAN-commentary-set the tone:for.the reaction.  It charged that
 the United States :had ,renioved.morethan n, 100 aircraft prior to
 .the Thai embargo, claimed that Bangkok had colluded.in this
 U.S. move, and declared that "this was a.hostile act-by,-the
 Ford Administration and the Thai Government .      and a.robbery
 of-the South Vietnamese people's property        ."  The paper
 scored "pro-U,.S.,authorities.. in Bangkok":as "hypocritical."
 A Liberation,Radio,commentary on.the 10th-echoed NHAN DAN',s
 harsh criticism of Bangkok and-demanded that the Thai Government
 "clarify its attitude by taking'action,.not by issuing statements."
 Another PRG radio commentary on the same day demanded that Bangkok
 "pay" South Vietnam for the property which it has ''allowed.the
 United States-to take away," but this demand has not been
 publicly repeated at an authoritative level.
 Perhaps reflecting.a movement of PRG-Thai negotiations into
 private channels, the PRG has released no further foreign ministry
 statements on the question of 'returning.ships and planes.  Hanoi
 on the.llth.releaseda.foreign ministry spokesman's statement
 dated the previous day,. responding to a statement by Singapore
 Prime Minister.Lee Kuan Yew on the 9th, which.pointed out that'.it
 would.be in the interest of relations between Vietnam.-and
 Singapore if the latter returned South Vietnamese:aircraf.t.and
 ships to the PRG.  Hanoi, but not the PRG, also issued a foreign
 ministry-spokesman's.s.tatement on 13 May accusing "Thai
 reactionaries" of "engineering" demonstrations against Vietnamese
 residents in.Thailand.

 Speaking on behalf of the RGNU, Hu Nim ridiculed alleged U.S.
 pretensions to humanitarianism when, he said, the United States
 actually was "the bloodiest supermurderer .  . . in the history
 of mankind."  Hu Nim charged that the United States has
 engaged in propaganda efforts against the new regime and has
 "planted traitorous forces" to continue "subversive and sabotage
 activities."  Hu Nim warned that his regime would not allow
 "U.S. imperialism, its allies, or its hirelings" to continue
 their "anti-Cambodian activities" with impunity.  The 10 May
 Ministry of Information and Propaganda communique similarly
 accorded primary responsibility for unfavorable Western press
 reports to the United States, accusing the U.S. "propaganda
 apparatus" of trying to "distort the truth" of Cambodia's efforts
 to deal with foreigners who remained in Phnom Penh despite the
 Front's repeated warnings that they evacuate.  Neither the
 statement by Hu Nim nor the communique specifically referred to
 President Ford's remarks on Cambodia at his 6 May press conference,
 and they both avoided referring by name to the Ford Administration,
 in line with Phnom Penh's practice since the Front victory.
 A 10 May commentary on foreign reaction to the Front's victory
 hailed Peking's relationship with Phnom Penh as "a radiant model"
 of international relations "based on sincere support and mutual
 respect."  The commentary warmly noted the PRC leaders' message
 of 18 April to the Front leaders and other signs of Chinese
 friendship.  It gave only perfunctory attention to Phnom Penh's
 relationship with Hanoi, mentioning assistance by Vietnam only
 in conjunction with support rendered.by Laos and the DPRK and
 identifying the three nations as the "other close comrades-in-arms
 of the Cambodian people in Asia."  Phnom Penh commentaries have
 continued to affirm that Cambodia is willing to accept aid from
 foreign countries so long as it is unconditional, accords with
 the regime's policy of self-reliance, and is not a subterfuge for
 subversion or interference--a stand set forth at the Front's
 second national congress in February and at the special national
 congress held on 25-27 April.
 DOMESTIC AFFAIRS     Phnom Penh radio continues to provide little
 concrete detail on the regime's efforts
 toward political consolidation and economic reconstruction. There
 has been no acknowledgment of the deportation of Cambodia's urban
 populace to the countryside nor any report on the fate of former
 GKR leaders Long Boret and Sirik Matak, but radio commentaries
 have indirectly touched upon these. questions.  A 12 May Phnom Penh
 radio commentary announced that the regime was carrying out the
 second congress' "political stand of solidarity" with former GKR

 officials and military personnel.     The commentary noted that,
 except for the seven "supertraitors" condemned by the February
 national congress, all connected with the former administration
 are currently "vigorously cooperating to build anew Cambodia."
 A 10 May radio commentary stated that "anybody going the wrong
 way by mistake or by past habit will be given a gradual moral
 and political reeducation by the people unt:;,l he or she is
 totally reformed and purified," adding that "zonly those who
 continue to sabotage our nation" will be punished in the future.
 Phnom Penh broadcasts since the special national congress have
 also highlighted the regime's attempt to restore communication
 and transportation facilities, efforts apparently being undertaken
 primarily under the direction of the army.  Separate broadcasts
 have reported work on several of Cambodia's major highways and rail
 lines, on Pochentong airport outside of Phnom Penh, and at the
 major port of Sihanoukville.
 PATHET LAO HAIL RESIGNATIONS, PLEDGE SUPPORT FOR 1973 ACCORD
 Pathet Lao broadcasts have welcomed the 9 May resignation of five
 leading "rightists" members of the coalition Provisional Government
 of National Union (PGNU), but have given no indication that the
 Lao Patriotic Front (LPF) has altered its policy of participating
 in the governing of Laos under terms of the 1973 Vientiane peace
 agreement.  The tone and content of the comment suggest the LPF
 is concerned with maintaining its image as a strict adherent to
 the Vientiane accord in order to avoid giving the impression they
 are seizing control of the government.  Initial Pathet Lao
 reaction to the resignations, in an 11 May radio commentary, was
 restrained, depicted the resignations as the result of mass
 pressure exerted by the Lao people, and charged the former
 officials with attempting to subvert the PGNU and its counterpart,
 the National Political Council of Coalition (NPCC).  The commentary
 .noted that despite the "schemes" of the rightists, the PGNU and
 the NPCC would "continue to run the affairs of state."  Subsequent
 Pathet Lao radio announcements reported the replacement of
 Defense Minister Sisouk na Champassak by General Khamouane Boupha,
 a member of the Pathet Lao-alined Patriotic Neutralist Forces.
 The radio quoted Premier Souvanna Phouma to the effect that all
 members of the armed forces should obey the new defense minister
 and urged the population to maintain unity and public order.

 14 MAY 1975
 The resignations of Defense Minister Sisouk, Finance Minister
 Ngon Sananikon, and several other officials were preceded by
 several weeks of strong Pathet Lao radio criticism of the
 rightist leaders, particularly of Sisouk and Meo,General Vang
 Pao, who were personally singled out for condemnation for their
 alleged initiation of recent attacks on LPF-controlled areas.
 Such personal attacks on Sisouk and other rightist officials
 have occurred periodically since the formation of the PGNU a
 year ago.  The most recent denunciations began on 22 April, two
 days after an LPF Central Committee spokesman issued a state-
 ment condemning the "reactionary clique" for launching attacks
 in the Sala Phoukoun area, and three days after Hanoi had
 issued a DRV Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement which
 "strongly refuted".Sisouk's "fabrications" concerning North
 Vietnamese troops in Laos.  In addition to commentaries attacking
 the rightists, the Pathet Lao radio carried reports of demonstra-
 tions in Vientiane in late April and early May by the
 "21 Organizations," a coalition of front groups who demanded
 that the PGNU force the rightists to comply strictly with the
 Vientiane accord.
 While criticizing Sisouk and Vang Pao, the Pathet Lao has
 suggested that the LPF has acted with restraint in the face of
 constant provocation by the rightists, at the same time warning
 that its patience was wearing thin.  Thus, a 6 May commentary
 stated that the patriotic forces were capable of wiping out
 Vang Pao's forces but that "this is not our primary goal . . .
 because we want to preserve the spirit of national concord
 called for in the peace accords."  The commentary closed with a
 threat to "duly punish or wipe them out" if the situation
 became more intolerable.  A later commentary directed at Sisouk,
 on 8 May, suggested that Pathet Lao patience had been exhausted,
 asking rhetorically if the "people" should sit idly by in the
 face of repeated rightist provocations, and answering its own
 query in the negative.  Citing Pathet Lao willingness to employ
 its "legitimate right to self-defense" as a "solemn warning,"
 the commentary pointedly suggested that Sisouk follow the example
 of Lon Nol and Thieu and leave the country with his family.
 MOSCOW, PEKING,        Moscow, Peking, and Hanoi have all reported
 HANOI TREATMENT        on recent developments in Laos, relying
 primarily for their information on Pathet
 Lao sources, although differing in the level of attention they
 have devoted to the situation.  Moscow, in a 12 May TASS report
 citing the Pathet Lao news agency (KPL), reported Vientiane was

 calm in the wake of the resignations; and an unattributed
 12 May Moscow domestic service commentary noted that the
 developments in Laos were aimed at eliminating the "last
 obstacles" to the full implementation of the Vientiane agreement.
 Peking gave extensive replay to'news reports from Laos on the
 resignations and Sisouk's replacement with Khamouane Boupha,
 repeating without elaboration or comment several Radio Pathet
 Lao commentaries highly critical of the former government
 officials.  Hanoi's VNA English-language transmission have not
 yet reported the resignations, but did carry reports on earlier
 developments in Laos, including a 12 May item citing KPL reorts
 that Sisouk and others were planning a "reactionary coup."

 V-E DAY
 MOSCOW WINDS UP CEREMONIES WITH BREZHNEV SPEECH. PEACE APPEAL
 Moscow's extraordinary three-month campaign to celebrate the 30th
 anniversary of V-E Day wound up rather anticlimatically, with a
 bland, relatively brief speech by Brezhnev and an equally bland
 peace appeal signed by the three top Soviet governing bodies.  In
 contrast with the generally militant and even jingoistic rhetoric
 that has characterized much of the campaign, these documents were
 mild in tone and clearly intended to accent the peaceful aspects
 of the Soviet Union's international posture.  On some of the
 peripheral political questions raised by the campaign--such as
 its implications for Brezhnev's political status--the evidence
 remains ambiguous.  The brevity of Brezhnev's speech--under an
 hour--seems to be a minus for him, but the award of marshal's
 stars signifying his promotion to the rank of General of the
 Army is clearly a plus.
 BREZHNEV'S IMAGE MIXED     The brevity of Brezhnev's speech meant
 that he did not dominate the press
 coverage of the event as he did 10 years ago on the occasion of
 the 20th anniversary in 1965.  On that occasion his speech was
 not only lengthy, extending from the first to the fourth page of
 PRAVDA, but it bristled with passages of great political interest.
 That was the speech which signaled the post-Khrushchev partial
 rehabilitation of Stalin; it was harshly critical of U.S. policy
 in Vietnam; it contained one of the rare acknowledgments by a
 Soviet leader of the domestic social impact of defense expenditures
 (in a statement declaring that the Soviet people understood the
 need foe such expenditures.)  By contrast, this year's speech was
 largely a panegyric to wartime heroism and, aside from it's
 expression of hope that the end of the war in Indochina would
 bolster U.S.-Soviet detente, carried little of political substance.
 Furthermore, this year Brezhnev shared the first four pages of
 PRAVDA with a half-dozen other speakers, none of political rank.
 While the briefness of his remarks may have been due to health
 reasons, the effect was still to diminish the public impact of his
 speech.
 The announcement on 9 May of the award of marshal's stars to
 Brezhnev confirms the accuracy of Grechko's reference in his
 18 April speech to Brezhnev as a "general of the army".  Nevertheless,
 the absence of an official announcement of Brezhnev's.promotion,
 plus the failure thus far of speakers other than Grechko to refer

 to him by his new rank, auggents that the promotion may have
 been pushed through against opposition.  Some support for thin
 suggestion in provided by name curious changes made last year in
 Soviet procedurenfor appointing Generals of the Army.
 According to the 6 November GAZETTE OF THE USSR 8UP1EME SOVIET,
 it wan decreed on 1 November that the rank of General of the
 Army would henceforth be conferred by the Supreme Soviet
 Presidium, rather than by the Council of tiinstern, an provided
 for in the law of 12 October 1967.  Thin meant that authority
 to confer the rank wan removed from Konygin'n jurisdiction and
 put in the hands of Podgornyy.  It in notable that only the
 rank of General of the Army--the presumptive next rank for
 Brezhnev--wag affected by the change in procedure.  In a second
 decree issued the same day, the Supreme Soviet Presidium provided
 that the "marshal's star" could henceforth be awarded to Generals
 of the Army.  Podgornyy signed both decrees.
 "141LITARY COOPERATION"     A recheck of the historical evidence
 also thrown some new light on the
 significance of a curious phrase which began to crop up in
 Soviet statements on the war anniversary several weeks ago.*  In
 his speech on 18 April &larshal Grechko had observed that the
 wartime alliance confirmed the possibility of effective "political
 and military cooperation" between states with different social
 systems.  Since Grechko permed to be implying that the wartime
 experience might serve as a model for the future, hie une of the
 phrase raised questions concerning his intentions.  However, when
 other Soviet speakers began to use the same phrase, it became
 apparent that the words were being drawn from a common sources.
 This source, the evidence shows, was tho original CPSU decree of
 9 February calling for the start of the anniversary campaign.  The
 context indicates that it was used in a historical sense and
 was intends: simply to describe the actual nature of the wartime
 alliance relationship.
 *  For a brief discussion of use of this phrase see the TRENDS
 of 7 May 1975, pages 22-23.

 JOth V-C bay anniversary cerer~ontes in goat fettt.n and Prague,
 both on I Hay.  In addition to V-1 bay, the festivities ccao=
 rated the Jbth liberation anniversaries of the OR (8 clay) and
 Csechosiovakta (9 clay).  The highest-tanking soviet teptegentatives
 at V-ly bay observances in Kastetn Curope Were CPSU Politbuto

 plans for a repeat visit this year veto canceled because of the
 renewed tensions surrounding bubcek and the juestton of vhethet

 In their speeches, Ilonecker and Husak. paid the conventional
 deference to the Soviet Union's tole in defeating Ilitler, barely
 mentioning the tole of the other "tbets of the "anti-Ilitlet
 coalition."  Ilusak's silence on the V.s. war tale #tav have been
 more a work of restraint than of disdain, hcrttevet, since the
 Ciechoslovak press had been caffying harsh anti- .eti.can att.icles

 singled out for praise several tithes, particularly by Kirilenko

 Citing Other factors Witch augured well for better relations.
 Castro ""Honed the resignation of President Ilixon and the
 end of the Vietnam war -often a feature in Cuban denunciations
 of U.S. "Imperialist" policy.  He added that the visitn of
 Senators Jnvits, Pell and HcGovetn were also "appreciated,"
 and be praised I4ctsovern as a a-an whose opposition to the war
 in Vietnam had deoonstrated that tie was a "loyal defender of
 peace."  In geptembet' 1914 Castrt, had not mentioned the visit
 then by Senators Javtts and Pell in delivering a harshly anti-
 V.5. anniversary speech.
 Queried, as usual, about alleged CIA ploto against him, Castro
 teplied--as he has in the past--that the "plots" had been
 '"knit ed for a long tine'in Cuba.  "Doaens of plots" had been
 discoveted, he rlat*ed, some of  theta involving the use of
 weapons "fton the Guantanatso naval bane."
 stC~I s#'i'i:tC      Cantro's re#?atks about relations with his Latin
 p,["i.llm            neighbors vere conciliatory, in line with the
 regime's indications of a desire to Improve
 C`.iha's status vin-a-vis other nations in the he- inphere.  Castro
 said that "ye are ready to abide by international nortls and
 respect all countries that te.spect us," and, although he
 expressed his hope that the Chilean people would "rid thetaelven
 of the fascist yoke," he added that "this is a matter to be
 decided by the Chileans thet selves."  As if dismissing the
 idea that such wild tetarks could be tied to the current session
 of the GA, several of whose tr rbetq have stated a willingness to
 lift sanctions against Cuba it the Cuban gaverneaant i ould
 ,s uatatatee nti-intetfetFtsc:e in other countries, Castro said that
 the OAS had "piayed a very sad role" and that "the best decision
 it way ft4kq is to dissolve itt3eif."

 For example, Moscow radio's "International Diary" program
 commentator Yevgeniy Kachanov noted on 7 May that McGovern's
 visit wan "directly linked by foreign observers" to nn
 "increasing trend among Washington political circles" favoring
 a review of relations.  In further tying the visit to an overall
 upgrading of Cuba's status, Kachanov observed that the trip
 came on the eve of an OAS mooting whose "chief topic" would
 be the sanctions "imposed on the OAS countries 11 years ago
 by the United States."  Kachanov, Couching lightly on the
 failure of last year's OAS foreign ministers' meeting to
 lift the sanctions because of voting rules requring a two-
 thirds majority, noted simply that "it is not beyond possibility"
 that now voting procedures being discussed "will correspond
 to the real state of affairs" and allow for a removal of the
 minority-supported sanctions.
 In the only available Soviet reaction to Castro's press conference,
 TASS on 10 May focused on his remarks about the blockade and U.S.-
 Cuban relations, noting Castro's statement that a "sufficiently
 wide" opening in the embargo would lead to a "reassessment by
 the Cuban side of relations with the U.S.A." TASS also reported
 that Castro had "expressed hope that the Chilean people will
 throw down the yoke of fascism," but made no mention of his other
 statements on hemispheric relations.

 CHINA-JAPAN
 JSP LEANS TCVARD PEKING STANCE IN COMPROMISE JOINT STATEMENT
 A 12 May joint statement signed by the Japan Socialist Party (JSP)
 delegation that visited Peking 5-12 May brings the JSP into public
 agreement with the Chinese on the question of opposition to
 "hegemonism of the two superpowers," meaning the United States
 and the Soviet Union.  Previously, the JSP had tried to steer a
 middle course between the Soviet Union and China.  Increasing
 Chinese satisfaction as the visit progressed was evident in
 NCNA coverage.  While NCNA did not characterize the atmosphere at
 the initial 5 May banquet for the delegation, later it described
 the 11 May farewell banquet as "permeated with a warm atmosphere
 of friendship." China-Japan Friendship Association President
 Liao Cheng-chih credited the visit's success to the "courage
 and resolution" of JSP Chairman Narita, thus identifying Narita
 even more closely with the communique.
 The joint statement is unabashedly a compromise document, stating
 that both sides decided to seek "common 9,riunds instead of stressing
 the differences between them" and thus reached agreement on "a
 number of major questions."  On their part the Chinese expressed
 "admiration" for the JSP's struggle against the U.S.-Japanese
 security treaty, a struggle Peking has virtually ignored in recent
 years as it has stressed the Soviet threat.
 While the JSP made a decided tilt in its position toward the
 Chinese side, it did make some attempt to assert that it was not
 opposing the Soviet Union, but rather certain specific actions by
 the superpowers.  Thrs, at the 11 May farewell banquet for the
 delegation, Narita tried to rationalize the JSP's virtual capitula-
 tion on the hegemony issue by stating that agreement had been
 reached on opposition to the two superpowers' hegemonism by
 discussing "concrete facts," implyLng that ,SSP agreement was not
 aimed at countries, but at particular actions or policies.  In
 this connection, the joint statement criticized U.S. efforts to
 "hang on" in South Korea and "further strengthen" military bases
 in Japan and also attacked the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia,
 its occupation of Japanese-claimed islands, and Soviet attempts

 to "peddle" an Asian collective security treaty.*  In the state-
 ment the JSP side also carefully noted its willingness to
 "develop relations with all countries."
 Both sides held that a China-Japan friendship treaty must be
 concluded "at an early date," and they followed the Chinese
 position in stating that the treaty must be "a step forward"
 from the 1972 joint government statement establishing diplomatic
 relations.  Peking-propaganda has assailed efforts to drop the
 hegemony clause as a "backward step" and the communique stated.
 that "no backward step is permissible."
 The joint statement's recording of Chinese "admiration" for the
 Japanese struggle to abrogate the Japan-U.S. security treaty and
 to dismantle unspecified military bases is unusual in recent
 practice, and moreover represents a dilution of China's position
 as stated in November 1970, in the last previous joint statement
 with a JSP delegation in Peking.  On that occasion the Chinese had
 not only expressed "heart-felt respect" for the struggle against
 the treaty, but had also specified support for struggle against
 U.S. military bases, against nuclear armament for Japan, and for
 Japan's "neutrality," all of which were omitted from the current
 statement.  Chinese support for such measures has dropped off as
 Peking propaganda has increasingly stressed the Soviet danger.
 In the past year there have been only two monitored Chinese media
 references to Japanese opposition to the security treaty, both of
 them NCNA replays of Japanese reports.
 *  The negative current reference to the Soviet plan for an Asian
 collective security system contrasts with another JSP position of
 October 1974, when a JSP-CPSU communique stated that both sides
 agreed that "an Asian peace and security system" could be created
 "by both collective and bilateral efforts."  Moscow was probably
 surprised by the JSP's decision to follow the Chinese lead; Moscow
 radio commentaries on 4 and 5 May had confidently predicted the
 JSP would not succumb to Chinese pressure.

 CHINA-EUROPE
 PEKING MOVES TO STRENGTHEN TIES WITH. WESTERN EUROPE
 China's desire to strengthen relations with Western Europe was
 sharply illustrated during the past week by Vice Premier Teng
 Hsiao-ping's departure for an official visit to France and
 Peking's agreement to establish formal relations with the'European
 Economic Community.  Teng, also.a CCP vice chairman, is the
 highest-ranking Chinese leader to make an official visit to a
 Western state since the cultural revolution.  Peking's agreement
 on relations with the EC came during a 4-11 May visit to China.
 by EC Vice President Christopher Soames, the first official EC
 representative to visit China..  Peking media comment on both
 visits has carefully underlined Chinese interest in West European
 unity as a bulwark against Soviet expansion in Europe.
 TENG VISIT    Teng Hsiao-ping's visit to France, which reciprocates
 former French President Pompidou's September 1973
 visit to China, has thus far been highlighted by discussions with
 .President Giscard, who hosted a banquet for the vice premier on
 13 May, and by talks with Prime Minister Chj.r'.c, who feted Teng
 at a banquet the previous evening.  As PRC Premier Chou.En-tai
 had done during Pompidou's visit to China, Teng has stressed in his'
 banquet speeches the longstanding friendly relations between China
 and France, established personally by Chairman Mao and former
 French President DeGaulle, has played up both sides' common
 resolve to maintain national independence against superpower
 interference, and has pointed to the Soviet Union--without
 explicitly mentioning it--as the main threat to West European
 security.  Teng has shown greater deference to French sensitivity
 about anti-USSR rhetoric than did Chou, however.
 In his speech at the welcoming banquet on 12 May, .Teng voiced
 an unusual Chinese interest in the establishment of a "relatively
 favorable international environment," but he warned that even
 though "the trees may prefer calm," the "wind" of superpower
 rivalry will not subside.  In a 13 May banquet speech Teng
 reaffirmed that U.S.-Soviet contention is centered in Europe, and
 he focused criticism on the USSR, warning that the-superpower
 "who talks the loudest about peace and security ..is the'very.one
 who flagrantly'imposes military threats on the people of the world,.
 the European peoples in particular."

 Teng's speeches have stressed a common Sino-French emphasis on
 national independence and resistance to "monopolization of
 world affairs by the superpowers."  Praising President Giscard
 D'Estaing's efforts to promote unity in West Europe, Teng explained
 in his 13 May speech that China has established ties with the EC
 and encouraged European unity mainly as a strategic measure,  He
 stated that through unity West Eurcpe would be able to safeguard
 its independence, play a "more positive role in world affairs,"
 and move the developing world situation in a "favorable
 direction."  He did.not mention the economic benefits of
 Chinese ties to the EC, but noted in his 12 May speech that China
 has far to go in economic and technical fields and said that
 China welcomed foreign economic contacts within a general frame-
 work of Chinese self-reliance.
 SOAMES DELEGATION     The EC delegation to Peking led by
 Christopher Soames held substantive
 discussions with Foreign Minister Chiao Kuan-hua and also met
 with Chou En-lai and Vice Premier Li Hsien-nien.  Peking formally
 revealed the establishment of official PRC-EC relations in a
 10 May NCNA report reviewing the delegation's visit.  The report
 replayed Foreign Trade Minister Li Chiang's remarks, at an 8 May
 banquet for the European guests, which presented the EC as a
 framework for strategic West European unity against external
 pressure and a "positive development."  Thc: report also highlighted
 Soames' 8 May press conference statement in Peking in which he
 stated that the EC has no ties with Taiwan.
 Peking's interest in promoting unity within the Common Market
 as an anti-USSR bulwark was explicitly set forth earlier, in a
 24 April NCNA report on the 21-24 April summit meeting of French
 President Giscard and FRG President Scheel in France.  The
 report cited Scheel's call for common EC foreign and defense
 policies--as well as economic--in order to protect against
 "foreign hegemony."  Peking's view that EC unity should be
 directed mainly against the USSR was reflected by NCNA's replay
 of Scheel's stress that a unified West Europe must "continue
 the alliance with the United States," and by its pickup of a West
 German newspaper comment that the summit meeting had shown that
 the Franco-German commitment to West European unity would serve
 to block Soviet efforts to isolate the FRG and extend Moscow's
 "imperialist influence westward."

 NOTE
 PRC-TAIWAN:  A 7 May-signed article carried by Peking's Fukien
 Front radio beamed -to Taiwan explicitly. linked the collapse of
 the, pro-U . S . .regimes in .Indochina with the situation faced by
 the Chiang government in Taiwan.  Equating the former.Thieu
 -regime in Saigon with the Taipei authorities,. the article said
 that Thieu's failure-stemmed from his reliance on the United
 ~States.and opposition . to' the will of the "people," and claimed
 .that Taipei wasconEinuing,a -similar policy .that would only
 "shorten one's life."  The.broadcast carefully noted that the
 United States consistently gave "full support and backing" to
 .shore up Saigon, :but .that -.its efforts were .in vain since the
 popular will cannot be checked by "imperialism." 'The article
 called.upon Taipei officials'to draw appropriate "lessons"
 from the Vietnamese :example, "return from .the wrong road," and
 work .for the "liberation" of.Taiwan.  A.26.April.Peking broad-
 cast..to Taiwan had noted in passing:the "lesson" of Phnom Penh
 .and Saigon for Taipei authorities but without such explicit
 suggestions.
