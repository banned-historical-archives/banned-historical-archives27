 reinstituted, but it is still encountering obstacles. China's defense industries
 are developing more advanced weapons for deployment over the next
 decade. These systems, although at best comparable to weapons widely
 deployed today with Western and Soviet forces, will add markedly to
 Beijing's defenses.
 Beijing is unlikely to make any major modifications in its defense strategy
 but is working to improve the integration of air, ground, and naval forces in
 joint military operations and to enhance the coordination of armor,
 artillery, and infantry in combined arms operations. China will continue
 for at least the next decade to rely on a combination of terrain, manpower,
 and defense in depth for its conventional defense and to base its nuclear de-
 fense on a small, but-in Beijing's view-survivable, nuclear deterrent.
 The size of the PLA should remain relatively stable for the next decade fol-
 lowing the successful streamlining of the force over the past three years
 The Soviet military buildup in the Far East underlies Beijing's defense
 modernization program. In response to Soviet ground, air, strategic missile,
 and naval deployments in the region, we believe Beijing is setting the
 following agenda for improving its military capabilities:
 ? Nuclear forces. To improve the Chinese deterrent to an aggressor's first
 strike, Beijing is deploying additional ICBMs, building a small fleet of
 ballistic missile submarines, and by the late 1980s probably will begin
 initial deployment of a solid-propellant, intermediate-range ballistic
 missile. Work on a new solid-propellant ICBM could begin soon and the
 system probably will be ready for deployment in the mid-1990s.
 ? Ground and air forces. To augment China's conventional capabilities to
 defend its national borders, Beijing is beginning widespread deployment
 of new antitank missiles, shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, and
 armored personnel carriers for mechanized infantry. By the late 1980s,
 Beijing will have widely deployed a tactical air defense missile and a new
 self-propelled gun. In the early- to mid-1990s, China will begin produc-
 tion of an advanced generation of fighter aircraft, helicopters equipped
 with antitank guided missiles, its first infantry fighting vehicle, and a
 new tank with improved armor protection and a modern main gun.

 ? Naval forces. Seeking to become a regional Pacific naval power, Beijing
 will deploy at least three more nuclear attack submarines and begin
 production of a new class of high-speed frigate equipped for antisubma-
 rine warfare and air defense roles by the early 1990s.
 China's military establishment is in general agreement on the moderniza-
 tion strategy, but there are divergent views as to priorities and the role of
 imports in weapons modernization. China's top civilian and military
 leaders have placed stringent restrictions on the purchase of Western
 weapons and are seeking primarily the import of production technology.
 Others, notably senior commanders of the Air Force and Navy, argue for
 the procurement of some advanced weapons from abroad to fill major gaps
 in defense capabilities quickly. Highlighting the ongoing debate, Defense
 Minister Zhang Aiping recently vetoed a Navy contract to buy British Sea
 Dart naval missiles and canceled Air Force negotiations with the French
 for Mirage fighters. We believe a policy of extremely selective weapons
 buys will prevail, although pressure from the various service arms for faster
 improvements will probably continue.
 China's success in meeting its military modernization objectives over the
 next decade will depend largely on the following factors:
 ? Success in higher priority programs to modernize agriculture, industry,
 and science and technology.
 ? The allocation of sufficient funds to finance the production of new
 weapons.
 ? The ability of the defense industries to modernize and to assimilate
 effectively foreign technology.
 ? The maintenance of domestic political stability.
 Beijing's improvements to its defense posture are unlikely to alter signifi-
 cantly the overall balance of forces in East Asia. By the end of the 1980s,
 new defensive weapons-if fielded in sufficient numbers-will considera-
 bly enhance China's capability to inflict heavy losses on any Soviet
 conventional invasion. The Soviets, however, will continue to improve their
 forces stationed along China's northern border and to hold an overwhelm-
 ing advantage in offensive power

 China's expanding nuclear capabilities will not represent a markedly
 increased threat to the United States in the early 1990s, because Beijing
 will have deployed only 10 to 20 full-range intercontinental missiles by
 then. China will continue to seek assistance from the United States and
 other advanced nations in improving its conventional arsenal and many of
 the anticipated weapons developments depend heavily on the ac uisition of
 advanced technology from the West.
 Although China is improving its amphibious assault capabilities through
 training, we detect no attempts to build the 70 to 100 tank landing ships we
 estimate are required for Beijing to pose a real invasion threat to Taiwan.
 A program to build large numbers of landing ships for this purpose is
 unlikely as it would divert scarce resources from higher priority programs.
 Weapons enhancements will enable Beijing to improve its capabilities
 against weapons currently in Taiwan's and Vietnam's inventories. New
 fighters, frigates, and armored vehicles, if deployed in strength in the
 1990s, will give China a qualitative advantage over its southern adversar-
 ies. Vietnam, in particular, may find its recently augmented northern
 border defenses jeopardized.

 China:
 Defense Modernization
 Strategy for the 1980s
 A recent assessment of China's conventional forces
 concludes that the Chinese People's Liberation Army
 has begun procuring a new generation of conventional
 military weapons and equipment.'
 These improvements in weaponry represent a signifi-
 cant step forward; one long-awaited by the Chinese
 military. This assessment examines China's military
 modernization strategy for the next decade. We be-
 lieve China's military planners have marked out a
 comprehensive and pragmatic course for military
 improvements in the 1980s and, within the limits of
 China's technological and economic capabilities, are
 making progress in gearing the PLA for modern
 warfare.
 Underlying Beijing's defense modernization program
 is its concern about the Soviet military buildup in the
 Far East. Beijing is well aware that Moscow has
 substantially augmented both its strategic and con-
 ventional military power opposite China by:
 ? More than tripling since 1965 the number of com-
 bat divisions deployed along the Sino-Soviet border.
 ? Expanding the Pacific Fleet until it has become the
 largest in the Soviet Navy.
 ? Upgrading airpower in the Soviet Far East by
 introducing the newest tactical aircraft and combat
 assault helicopters in the Soviet inventory.
 ? Expanding its large nuclear strike force by deploy-
 ing Backfire bombers and the highly mobile SS-20
 intermediate-range ballistic missiles in the Far East.
 ? Gaining access to Vietnamese air and naval bases
 and providing large quantities of sophisticated
 weapons to Hanoi.
 Beijing has monitored the Soviet buildup but has had
 little recourse beyond increasing the number of com-
 bat divisions-equipped with vintage 1950s weap-
 ons-stationed opposite the Soviet Union and Viet-
 nam. Political turmoil kept Beijing from addressing
 the problems of China's deteriorating military posi-
 tion until Deng Xiaoping's consolidation of power in
 the late 1970s. As Chief of Staff of the PLA, Deng in
 July 1975 delivered a blistering attack on the state of
 the armed forces to a session of the Military Commis-
 sion of China's Communist Party. He condemned the
 PLA's five sins of "laziness, bloatedness, factionalism,
 arrogance, and extravagance." Deng outlined in a
 central directive a blueprint for strengthening the
 military, but his master plan was interrupted when he
 was purged for a second time in 1976 by the Gang of
 Four. Deng returned to power in July 1977 and,
 resuming the position of PLA chief of staff, began to
 implement the needed reforms
 Deng's program is described by the Chinese as a
 process of building the PLA into a modern armed
 force by gradual improvement. The first step is to
 transform the PLA from a highly politicized and
 militarily deficient force into a professional military
 organization. The second and more costly step is the
 overall updating of the PLA's weapons
 Given the damage done over the last 20 years, Deng
 and his allies have already made remarkable progress
 in reinstituting professionalism in the PLA. The re-
 formers are using as their template the military
 program of the 1950s. Many of the military leaders of
 that era were rehabilitated between 1973 and 1975 to
 help reshape the PLA and steer it away from the
 leftist egalitarianism imposed on the military from
 the late 1950s and especially during the Cultural
 Revolution
 Since 1978, the reformers have streamlined the PLA,
 consolidated commands, and reopened military acade-
 mies. Examinations and diplomas from military acad-
 emies have replaced knowledge of Maoist doctrine

 and peasant backgrounds as the criteria for recruit-
 ment and promotion. In addition, the PLA has in
 recent years begun the politically sensitive task of
 replacing the old guard with a younger generation of
 better educated cadre (officers). Beijing is also experi-
 menting with new tactical military concepts designed
 to make more effective use of existing weapons and
 anticipated new arms.
 Streamlining
 The most sweeping and successful facet of profession-
 alization is the program to trim the size of the armed
 forces. We estimate that since 1980 the Chinese,
 without deactivating any main combat units, have
 through demobilizations reduced the size of the PLA
 by approximately 1 million men.'
 The program singled out for retirement the old,
 feeble, illiterate, or politically unreliable. The ground
 forces, the largest combat arm of the PLA, have
 undergone the bulk of the personnel reductions both
 in combat and combat support units. Deng Xiaoping
 encountered some opposition to the program but,
 according to Permanent Vice-Chairman of the Party
 Military Commission Yang Shangkun, Deng success-
 fully defended the reductions.
 Phasing Out the Old
 As Beijing completes the trimming of the PLA, it is
 turning its attention to rejuvenating the officer corps.
 Cadre transfer campaigns-a program of discharging
 officers from the military and placing them in civilian
 governmental positions-have rid the PLA of its

 Secret
 Following improvements in the level of modern weap-
 ons, equipment and the command system, it is entire-
 ly possible to appropriately reduce the number of
 soldiers. Just as Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: A
 reduction and not an increase in manpower is a sign
 of modernization. It can thus be seen that practicing
 the policy of better troops is not a negative or
 stagnant policy but a positive and advanced one.
 Military Commission Secretary General Yang
 Shangkun, August 1982
 unwanted, overaged junior-grade officers. But the
 task of removing senior officers who are too old for
 effective service has proved far more difficult.
 Many senior officers entered the army before 1930
 and are respected veterans of the "long march."
 Beijing has moved cautiously to entice rather than
 require their retirements and is offering them lucra-
 tive benefits such as full salary, free housing, trans-
 portation, and medical care. As face-saving measures,
 some old commanders are being given the title of
 "adviser." In a recent visit to units in the northeast,
 Chief of Staff Yang Dezhi called on these old soldiers
 to retire but also to help the new officers by "mount-
 ing their horses and riding part of the way with
 them."
 Nonetheless, there are signs that continuing resist-
 ance to retirement from aged officers is impeding the
 progress of rejuvenation. One military region com-
 mander who gave up his post in 1982, Wu Kehua of
 Guangzhou, told a subcommittee session of the 12th
 National Congress that aged officers continued to
 fear that younger men were incompetent and that
 retirement would mean both a loss of political status
 and a lower standard of living. Yang Shangkun
 appeared to confirm that Beijing is encountering some
 resistance when he told a military audience in Febru-
 ary that it would take three to five years to complete
 the program of making the officer corps younger in
 Pronouncements.in the Chinese media indicate that
 Beijing's efforts to retire the old guard did begin
 registering notable successes last fall. At the national
 level, there were several key military personnel
 changes, including the appointment of a new Minister
 of National Defense and a new Director of the
 General Political Department of the PLA. In addi-
 tion, four out of the 11 military region commanders
 were replaced. Yang Dezhi announced at the Sixth
 National People's Congress in June 1983, that the
 average age of commanders was now close to 50 for
 army-level officers, 45 for division-level officers, and
 below 40 for regimental-level officers. Although Yang
 may have exaggerated his successes, provincial press
 pronouncements show that China's 36 military dis-
 tricts are currently being revamped. At last count, 19
 military districts had announced the selection of new,
 younger, and better educated commanders and politi-
 Easing out older officers is allowing China's military
 leaders to consolidate the command structures at all

 mand levels were "bloated." This occurred because
 the PLA created new positions in commands for the

 original fighters of the revolution rather than force
 anyone to step aside. Analysis of leadership appear-
 ances indicates that the PLA's operation arm-the
 General Staff Department-has halved the number of
 subordinate service arm commands and shows a drop
 from as many as 10 to five active deputy chiefs of
 staff.
 The military region commands were also consolidated
 last fall. The staff of the Guangzhou commander,
 identified in Chinese media accounts as the model,
 dropped from 12 deputy commanders and political
 commissars to six. At the military districts, the same
 cuts are occurring with one district noting a 40-
 percent reduction in the size of headquarters staff.
 Bringing in the New
 China is creating a new, senior-level officer corps by
 filling vacated positions with those officers trained in
 the military academies before the Cultural Revolu-
 tion. These new military commanders have had a
 markedly different experience in the military than
 their predecessors. The new army and division com-
 manders were recruited during or after the civil war
 and their most prominent experience with warfighting
 was the Korean War, the Sino-Indian border conflict,
 or the 1979 clash with Vietnam. They entered the
 PLA as it first acquired tanks, aircraft, and other
 weapons of modern combat, and from the beginning
 of their careers the PLA was a regular army. In
 addition, many of the new guard are college educated
 and most have attended professional military acade-
 mies at various points in their careers. They are, in
 general, more professional and probably more capable
 than the old guard of learning and adapting new
 warfighting weapons and techniques
 Beijing has also made dramatic changes in recruit-
 ment policies for junior-grade officers. Before 1978,
 military academies had been closed for 10 years and
 the PLA had no alternative but to continue its
 traditional practice of promoting soldiers through the
 ranks into the officer corps. Today, Beijing has abol-
 ished direct promotions and is sending promising
 soldiers to the military academies before promotion
 and inducting high school and college graduates as
 officer candidates. For 1983, Beijing has announced
 the following steps:
 ? 12,850 soldiers from the ranks, the highest number
 ever, have been selected to attend 30 army colleges
 this fall as officer candidates.
 ? 20 military schools will admit senior middle school
 graduates, for the first time, for a four-year educa-
 tion as officer candidates.
 ? 7,700 college and university graduates will be com-
 missioned as officers upon completing a short course
 at military schools.
 The PLA's ultimate goal is to reduce the number of
 junior officers trained at colleges outside of the PLA
 and eventually have every officer enter the unit with a
 college education. According to military attache re-
 ports, only 20 percent of the junior officers are
 graduates of military academies, and the PLA hopes
 to increase the number to 80 percent by 1990. For the
 time being, however, the small numbers of academies
 and instructors means the PLA must rely on recruit-
 ment of officers trained in nonmilitary schools.
 Returning to the Barracks
 In addition to streamlining the regular PLA, Beijing
 is removing the army from public security and con-
 struction duties. The PLA has been the last bastion
 against civil disorder and in the turmoil of the
 Cultural Revolution army units assumed responsibil-
 ity for internal order throughout China.
 In 1982, the PLA began handing over police functions
 to the People's Armed Police Force, a reconstituted
 internal security organization subordinate to the
 Public Security Bureau. The People's Armed Police
 was first formed out of the PLA in 1955 when an
 estimated 170,000 PLA troops were transferred to the
 Ministry of Public Security. During the Cultural
 Revolution, the People's Armed Police was absorbed
 Beijing announced in April the formation of
 national headquarters for the People's Armed Police
 and said the new force would maintain internal
 security, suppress sabotage, maintain social order,
 safeguard life and property, and cooperate with the
 PLA on border defense.

 comprised almost 500,000 men in 50 division-level

 Reestablishing Ranks
 Another emerging facet of a professional PLA is the
 reestablishment of ranks.
 The rank
 structure was abolished in 1965 and since then the
 PLA has used position to identify command authority.
 Reestablishment of ranks is a particularly vexing
 issue for the military. Some PLA voices argue that
 ranks will destroy the egalitarian spirit of the army
 and cause unnecessary competition for promotions.
 Some are also concerned that strict "up or out" rules
 will be applied to all officers. Ranks will certainly
 force the high command to set up army-wide evalua-
 tion procedures and promotion boards as well as

 in August that the new uniforms would be phased in
 over the next two years
 Revitalizing the Reserves
 An aspect of PLA professionalism that has not yet
 been fully revitalized is the reserve system. Prior to
 the Cultural Revolution, demobilized soldiers served
 as members of a militia unit for five years. Officers,
 depending on age, either returned to their old unit or
 actively trained with a militia unit for one month each
 year. During the Cultural Revolution, demobilized .
 soldiers and officers were simply given letters stating
 that they should return to their units during a national
 recall. The militia was politicized as the leftists
 attempted to build it into their own military force that
 reportedly included 250 million people with virtually
 no regularized training.
 Today, the Chinese Chief of General Staff has set as
 major goals the creation of a reserve system and the
 trimming and revitalization of the militia. A mid-
 March radiobroadcast noted that militia reforms were
 intended to make the militia an integral part of the
 PLA reserve system. Presumably, demobilized sol-
 diers will once again join militia units which undergo
 serious and rigorous training, and a reserve officer
 system will reemerge to keep a body of trained
 officers ready to reenter military service in times of
 wartime mobilization.
 Using Existing Weapons Effectively
 Largely as a result of lessons learned during its 1979
 border war with Vietnam, the PLA is looking at ways
 to use existing weapons more effectively. Chinese
 officers have repeatedly bemoaned the poor coordina-
 tion of infantry, armor, and artillery units during that
 conflict. A 1980 article in the army newspaper,
 Liberation Army Daily, pointedly advised officers
 that infantry assaults using hand-to-hand combat
 techniques are unlikely to succeed against highly
 mechanized Soviet divisions possessing substantial
 firepower. The author noted that the PLA did best in
 Vietnam when infantry commanders remembered
 that the PLA had artillery and called in long-range
 fire support before mounting infantry assaults against
 defensive positions.
 The Chinese clearly are emphasizing improved com-
 bined arms operations. A Hong Kong magazine,
 quoting a Chinese military source, reported in April
 that the Military Commission recently directed the
 formation of "combined arms armies" with artillery
 and armor divisions added to the standard three
 The PLA is also holding increasingly sophisticated
 combined arms, joint-service, and intraservice train-
 ing exercises. In the fall of 1981, Beijing conducted its
 largest military exercise ever, involving more than
 50,000 troops and 500 combat aircraft. The combined
 ground and air force operation, northwest of Beijing,
 was designed to test joint operations to counter a
 Soviet attack. Since that time we have noted other
 important advanced exercises:

 Chinese airborne forces had staged their largest

 Soviet threat includes over 15,000 tanks, 1,200 heli-

 number of F-8s during the rest of this decade, while
 developing an advanced generation of fighter and

 Improved Offensive Punch
 The weapons being developed to augment China's
 border defenses also offer new capabilities for offen-
 sive operations. The new armored vehicles under
 development, for example, will give Chinese combat
 forces an enhanced ability to fight "head-to-head" in
 a counteroffensive against a Soviet ground assault. F
 The Chinese also are concerned about having the

 improved the military strength of Vietnamese forces
 opposite China. Beijing, in order to maintain its
 military options, needs new weapons capable of de-
 feating Vietnam's modern fighter aircraft, tanks, and
 artillery. We believe that Beijing will augment the

 Region and selected units along its border with Viet-

 Naval Forces
 China's Navy remains predominantly a coastal de-
 fense force, but improvements made in the 1970s give
 the force capabilities to venture farther from China's
 coast. New guided-missile frigates, destroyers, and
 underway-replenishment oilers were built and added
 to each of China's three fleets. In May 1980 the Navy
 demonstrated its new capability for extended opera-
 tions with the deployment of an 18-ship task force to
 an impact area near the Fiji Islands in support of an
 ICBM test.
 Advances over the past decade do not, however, allow
 the Chinese Navy to conduct open-ocean operations
 during wartime. The Navy depends heavily on land-
 based aircraft for its air defense and on the shallow
 waters of the continental shelf for protection against
 submarine attack
 Regional Pacific Power. We believe that Beijing does
 envision a navy that by the year 2000 will have
 extended its coastal defense and prepared for naval
 engagements beyond the continental shelf. China has
 no pretension of being a naval power approaching the
 order of the United States or the Soviet Union, but
 does wish to extend its area of naval operations in
 order to advance claims to disputed territories-such
 as the Spratly Islands-and in a limited manner
 assert its authority as a regional, Pacific naval power.
 In a conversation with US defense attaches in July, a
 high-level Chinese naval officer stated that the Navy
 plans to increase the frequency of blue water opera-
 tions and intends to operate in the Sea of Japan. In his
 words, "If the Russians can do it, so can we."
 Nuclear Attack Submarines and High-Speed
 Frigates. Foremost among Beijing's programs to im-
 prove its naval power is the construction of Han-class
 nuclear attack submarines. Two were built in the
 1970s
 The Hans could provide an
 oceangoing task force with an added offensive weapon
 against other surface combatants and a greater de-
 fense against enemy submarine attacks.
 Although the Navy built a number of new surface
 combatants in the 1970s, all were of 1950s design.
 Beijing is reportedly planning to construct a new
 series of combatants during the next decade. Military
 attaches earlier this year reported that China plans to
 build 10 to 20 newly designed 1,900-ton frigates using
 US gas turbine and West German diesel engines. We
 believe that at least some of these modern frigates will
 be outfitted for antisubmarine warfare-because of
 their quiet-running turbine engines-while others will
 be equipped for an air defense role.
 Helicopter Carriers. Beijing is also contemplating the
 development of a light helicopter carrier. Eventual
 procurement of a light carrier would be an important
 step toward becoming a regional naval power and add
 considerably to the air defense and antisubmarine
 warfare capabilities of any task force. Beijing, in the
 past, discussed the purchase of a foreign-built light
 carrier with British and French officials but no
 contracts were signed. More recently the Chinese
 have been considering building their own carrier,
 procure a light carrier but would not expect deploy-
 ment before the mid-1990s
 Short-Term Improvements. In the short run, the Navy
 will probably field several systems which will improve
 fleet air defense, antiship, antisubmarine warfare, and
 submarine warfare capabilities without requiring the
 procurement of capital ships. These improvements
 include:
 ? Hoku-class missile patrol boats modified to carry
 new solid-propellant antiship missiles.

 The attitudes the Defense Minister represents are
 viewed by some military officers as extremely
 conservative and backward. Some PLA voices charge
 that the high command favors the ground forces and
 prefers to see indigenous, albeit inferior, weapons put
 into service rather than press for funds for expensive

 Arms Sales
 Arms sales to foreign customers offer Beijing a
 method of procuring military technology and hiring
 consultants without placing additional requirements
 on the state budget. China's three-year-old drive to
 sell weapons on the international arms market has
 resulted in contracts for more than $4 billion in
 military exports. These sales may help pay for new
 PLA weapons as profits run as high as 100 percent on
 some items. According to attache reports from Beij-
 ing, China sells F-7s (MIG-21s) to Egypt for about $2
 million each, but we estimate the Chinese produce the
 fighter for only about $1 million a copy. With orders

 The Chinese leadership may also be more willing to
 allocate funds to modernize defense industries, believ-
 ing that advanced hardware can then be used to earn
 foreign exchange as well as serving to reequip and
 modernize the PLA. China, according to a US De-
 fense attache source, recently offered to sell the SA-7
 to foreign customers even before the weapon is widely
 deployed with Chinese combat units. Other examples
 of arms sales before widespread deployment include
 the type 69 tank and a new armored recovery vehicle.

 Aside from earning foreign exchange, China benefits
 from occasional technology transfers from foreign
 customers. Through its sales to Pakistan, China has
 obtained access to Western air-to-air and surface-to-
 air missiles. Three years ago, China reduced the price

 For the Sino-Soviet Balance
 By the end of the decade, new defensive weapons-if
 fielded in sufficient numbers-will considerably en-
 hance China's capability to inflict heavy losses on any
 Soviet conventional invasion. Widely deployed anti-
 tank missiles will, for the first time, provide the

 Even if we can have 10 or 20 years to modernize our
 armedforces, our weapons and equipment will re-
 main inferior to those of our enemies. For this reason,
 if war should break out, we must continue to defeat
 the strong with the weak. It has always been our
 experience to defeat a superior enemy with inferior
 equipment, for we wage a righteous war and a
 people's war. In this, we must have full confidence.
 Military Commission Chairman Deng Xiaoping,
 December 1977
 Chinese infantry a credible capability to defeat all
 models of Soviet tanks, with the possible exception of
 the few T-72s, now deployed in the Far East. We
 expect the Soviets will improve their forces stationed
 along China's northern border and continue to hold an
 overwhelming advantage in offensive power
 China's growing nuclear arsenal will ensure that the
 Soviets pay an even higher price for any first strike
 against China in the 1990s. By the mid-1990s, with
 nuclear ballistic missile submarines continuously on
 station, the Chinese will notably enhance the viability
 of their nuclear deterrent.
 For the United States
 China's expanding nuclear arsenal will not represent a
 significantly increased threat to the United States in
 the early 1990s. We estimate that China will deploy a
 force of 10 to 20 full-range intercontinental missiles
 which will give Beijing the capability to mount only
 limited retaliatory strikes against soft targets in the
 United States.
 Many of the anticipated weapons improvements for
 China's conventional forces depend heavily on the
 acquisition of advanced technology and production
 know-how from the West. Beijing considers American
 technology to be superior and will continue to seek
 assistance from the United States to upgrade its
 military capabilities. Former Deputy Chief of Staff
 for Intelligence, Wu Xiuquan, told a visiting delega-
 tion of academics last October that, although China
 will use its own technological abilities, it desires US
 assistance-provided it is offered on favorable
 terms-in such areas as modern attack helicopters
 and fighter aircraft.
 For Taiwan and Vietnam
 Although China is improving its amphibious assault
 capabilities through training, we detect no attempts to
 build the large numbers of landing ships that are
 required for Beijing to pose a real invasion threat to
 Taiwan. Such a program is unlikely as it would divert
 resources from higher priority areas. We believe
 Beijing's intention is to create a small Marine Corps
 over the next decade for defense of its offshore islands
 and to improve its chances of success in an amphibi-
 ous assault against islands such as the Spratlies.
 Weapons enhancements will enable Beijing to im-
 prove its capabilities against weapons currently in
 Taiwan's and Vietnam's inventories. New Chinese
 fighters, frigates, and armored vehicles, if deployed in
 strength in the 1990s, will give the Chinese a qualita-
 tive advantage over its southern adversaries. Vietnam,
 in particular, will find its recently augmented
 northern border defenses jeopardized. We anticipate,
 however, that both Taiwan and Vietnam will seek
 assistance from abroad in order to keep pace with the
 Chinese]

 We believe China's military modernization objectives
 for the next decade are both reasonable and achiev-
 able. However, China's technological limitations are
 many and defense modernization continues to have a
 lower priority than programs to modernize agricul-
 ture, industry, and science and technology. The na-
 tional economy must continue to improve if the PLA's
 goals are to be fulfilled.
 Defense industries in China, even though improving,
 still experience considerable delays in moving weap-
 ons from development to deployment, and as they
 begin production of advanced weapons they are cer-
 tain to encounter numerous difficulties. Technology
 imports will help but-as in the case of China's ill-
 fated experience in the 1970s with the British Spey
 fighter engine-they are no guarantee of success.
 Funding for defense modernization remains an unre-
 solved issue. The PLA can expand its nuclear arsenal
 and procure low-cost antitank and air defense weap-
 ons within the current limits of defense spending. But
 substantially increased defense outlays are needed to
 fund the production of expensive major weapons
 systems (such as self-propelled artillery, armored per-
 sonnel carriers, aircraft, and frigates) currently under
 development. Limited procurement of these weapons
 will not meet Beijing's defense needs, and statements
 by PLA spokesmen indicate that the military does not
 expect higher defense outlays before 1986. If funding
 is not available, the military will be forced to make
 hard choices between weapons programs.
 Success also depends on continued domestic stability
 and civilian support of military modernization. Deng
 Xiaoping, as the primary architect, will undoubtedly
 continue to guide and support defense modernization.
 The relationship between the professional military
 and Deng's chosen successors remains hazy, however,
 and the military could find itself with diminished
 support after Deng's death.
 China's military industrial complex. The limitations
 of China's defense industries are substantial, but
 success in the past few years at acquiring selected
 Western technology leads us to believe China will
 make significant progress in weapons improvements.
 The professionalization of the PLA is off to an
 impressive start and Beijing appears to be preparing
 well for the future. The retirement of aged officers
 and the promotion of educated younger men is a
 positive signal of renewal. Fresh thinking in tactics
 and training are likely from the new guard and
 already there are signs of innovations in the use of
 existing weapons. According to attache reports, the
 Chinese recently proposed to the British an Air Force
 officer exchange program in which Chinese fighter
 pilots would receive flight training in the United
 Kingdom. Programs of this nature will guarantee the
 introduction of new fi htin tactics into the PLA.
 Beijing's improvements to its defense posture are
 unlikely to alter significantly the overall balance of
 forces in East Asia. Improvements to the Soviet
 military position will continue, and the best Beijing
 can hope for is to narrow the gap in weapons quality
 from the current 20-year lag behind those of the
 Soviets to perhaps 10. Beijing will, however, have
 maintained and strengthened its strategic deterrent
 and new ground force weapons-if deployed in quan-
 tity-will increase the capabilities of the conventional
 forces to mount a credible defense along the Soviet
 We are, nonetheless, impressed with the array of
 weapons development programs now under way and
 the recent successes Beijing has had in adding to its
 nuclear arsenal attests to the growing capabilities of
