 6 MAY 1970
 INiOCHINA
 President Nixon's 30 April TV speech in which he announced that U.S. as
 well as GVN ground troops were being sent into Cambodia prompts govern-
 meat statements from the communist countries,                           Consistent with the
 fiction that Vietnamese communist forces are not operating in Cambodia,
 the statements gloss over the President's explanation that the allied
 aim is to discover and destroy the headquarters for the communist
 military operations in South Vietnam.  On 2 May the DRV issued both
 a government statement denouncing the "overt aggression" against
 Cambodia and a foreign ministry statement protesting the "large-sca.la"
 air strikes against North Vietnam.  The 6 May declarations by the LRV
 and PEu Paris conference delegations postponing the session scheduled
 for that day until the 14th come as a logical sequel to the foreign
 ministry's warning that the bombings "will seriously affect" the talks:
 Soviet concern over U.S. actions ir, dramatized by Kosygin's unprecedented
 If May press conference where he read the government statement which
 condemned the military intrusion into Cambodia and charged that the
 air strikes against the DRV "violated the commitments undertaken in
 the agreement that served as a basis for the four-sided Paris talks."
 The statement was noncommittal regarding any specific Soviet action,
 and Kosygin replied to a reporter's question on increased aid to the
 DRV with the remark that the question "will obviously be reviewed."
 The PRC Government statement one the 4th also assails both the actions
 in Cambodia and the "resumed bombing" of the DRV, calling them "an
 extremely grave step" to expand the war.  While the statement calls
 the actions "frantic provocations" against the Chinese as well as
 the Indochinese peoples, it does not go beyond the pledge of "powerful
 backing" and "all-out support and assistance."
 Peking media on 5 May carried Sihanouk's announcement of the formation
 of a Cambodian government in exile along with Chou En-lai's letter
 formally recognizing the new government as the "only legal" one.  TASS
 reported the proclamation of the government in exile within an hour
 after the Peking broadcast, but at this writing Soviet recognition
 has not been mentioned.  DRV recognition is announced by Hanoi media
 on the 6th.
 DRV. PRG SCORE U.S. "AGGRESSION" AGAINST CAMBODIA
 NIXON      Authoritative Hanoi reaction to the President's speech
 SPEECH     came on 2 May with the release of statements from the DRV
 delegation at the Paris talks and a DRV Government statement
 denouncing the "aggression" against Cambodia.  The PRG Government
 statement was not published until the 4th, but a PRG Foreign Ministry

 statement on the 30th had responded to the preceding day's announce-
 ment of the U.S.-supported GVN operation in the Parrot's Beak area
 of Cambodia.  The 1 May statement by the PRG delegation at Paris was
 not carried by LPA until the 4th.
 Neither the official statements nor routine propaganda directly
 acknowledge President Nixon's explanatory remarks on tie necessity
 to clear out the communist sanctuaries in Cambodia.  The DRV
 Government statement says merely that the President "multiplied
 slanders" against the DRV; the PRG statement goes a bit further
 when it observes that he "brazenly and slanderously accused the
 PRG and DRV of waging aggression against Cambodia."  Both the
 statements as well as routine propaganda ridicule the President's
 statement that the allied action in Cambodia is aimed at saving
 American lives in South Vieteam.
 The government statements and other propaganda refer to the
 Indochinese summit meeting as evidence of Vietnamese-Lao-Khmer
 solidarity, and both Hanoi and the Front pledge wholehearted
 support to the "fraternal" struggles in Indochina.  The D:RV state-
 ment expresses the "belief" that "brothers and friends" worldwide
 will strengthen their support for the three struggles, while the
 PRG statement "appeals" for "increased support and aid" for the
 Indochina struggle.  LPA reports on It May that PRG Foreign Minister
 Binh called on French Foreign Minister Schumann on the lst, when
 she informed him of the recent Indochinese summit meeting and
 spoke of the "extremely serious situation created by the U.S. direct
 armed aggression in Cambodia."  LPA also reports that she reaffirmed
 the resolve of the PRG and South Vietnamese people "to stA.nd shoulder
 to shoulder with the fraternal Khmer people to win back independence
 and freedom."
 Press and radio comment on the President's speech includes a
 NHAN DAN Commentator article on the 3d which observes that the
 decision to move into Cambodia was taken 10 days after the President
 delivered his speech "boasting about the so-called sc'heme to
 restore a just peace to Vietnam and Cambodia."  Commentator levels
 personal abuse at the President, claiming that "Nixon lied" when
 he said that the U.S. ac'ion was aimed at protecting the interests
 of the South Vietnamese and the Cambodians:   "he is the biggest
 pix,ate and the most vicious liar."  Other such vitriolic comment
 includes a 4 May LPA commentary which is replete with personal
 epithets and a Hanoi radio commentary on the 3d which says the
 President's arguments were those of a "brazen-faced brigand."
 Liberation Radio says on the 3d that the President is continuing
 "Johnson's decayed colonialist scheme" in persevering with the war

 for more than a year.  This commentary notes the President's reference
 to a possible Republican loss at the polls in 1970 and to his own fate
 in 1972; it says "Nixon recklessly used crafty arguments to
 psychologically stir up" the American people when he said he would
 rather be a one-term President than see the United States become a
 second-class power and lose its first war in hv'.story.  There is
 frequent reference to U.S. domestic opposition to the President's
 decision.  The NHAN DAN Commentator article on the 3d, for example.
 notes that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee requested a meeting
 to question the P;-esident--"the first such request in 51 years."
 The President's remarks on aid to Cambodia are glossed over for the
 most part, but VNA on the 2d does accurately quote him as saying that
 the United States would agree to the shipment of "small arms and
 other equipment which the Camoodinrl army needs and can use now for its
 defense."  A Hanoi radio commentary on 1 May observes that the President
 "let it be known" that the United States and its allies "will do their
 'best to provide weapons and equipment for the Lon Nol-Sirik Matak
 clique."  But a Liberation Radio commentary on the same day ignores
 the President's remark that Cambodia could not easily utilize massive
 amounts of military assistance and claims that he "supported" the
 Lon Nol regime's request for "large amounts of military aid."
 ARVN OPERATION    Reaction to the 29 April announcement of the U.S.-
 supported ARVN operation in Cambodia includes the
 assertion by DRV delegate Nguyen Minh Vy at the 65th session of the
 Paris talks on 30 April that the operation is a "new, extremely serious
 escalation by the Nixon Administration."  LPA's account of the session
 reports that PRG delegate Dinh Ba Thi "strongly condemned" the
 Nixon Administration for sending U.S. and GVN troops into Cambodia to
 launch a military operation on 29 April.  There was no such explicit
 reference in the text of Thi's prepared statement; while he may have
 made such remarks in the rebuttal portion of the session, LPA and
 VNA normally do not report rebuttal remarks in such detail.
 Front media on the 30th released a PRG Foreign Ministry statement saying
 that the operation announced on the 29th "surpasses" all previous ones
 conducted by the United States and the GVN against Cambodia.  There
 is no comparable official DRV statement, but the action is scored in
 Hanoi radio comment on the 30th, and a NHAN DAN commentary on 1 May
 uses language identical to Vy's at Paris in calling the operation a
 "new, extremely serious escalation."

 HAN0I SAYS ESCALATED AIR STRIKES MAY AFFECT' PARIS TALKS
 AIR STRIKES     Large-scale U.S. air strikes against targets in North
 ON 1, 2 MAY     Vietnam on 1 and 2 May are protested in the 2 May
 DRV Foreign Ministry statement--the first such state-
 ment at this level in more than a year.  DRV protests against air
 strikes have usually taken the form of statements by a foreign
 ministry spokesman; the last such statement was issued on 23 April,
 protesting alleged attacks on 19 April. The last foreign ministry
 statement on U.S. air strikes in the North was issued on 29 January
 1969; it denounced alleged B-52 raids, describing them as "the most
 serious acts of war" against the DRV since the bombing halt.
 The current foreign ministry statement charges that on 1 and 2 May
 the United States sent more than 100 aircraft "in several groups to
 launch large-scale attacks on populated areas" in Quang Binh and
 Nghe An provinces.  It claims that "many" civilians were killed or
 wounded, "including 20 children."
 The statement links the air strikes with other U.S. actions, charging
 that "this is a deliberate action carried. out simultaneously with the
 overt U.S. aggression against Cambodia and the extension of the war
 into the whole of Indochina."  It maintains that "frenzied U.S. acts
 of war" have revealed the United States' losing position "in the face
 of the force of militant solidarity binding the three Indochinese
 peoples."  In its routine conclusion that the United States will be
 held responsible for all consequences of its actions, tie statement
 describes the attacks as a "new act of war escalation."
 IMPACT ON       The foreign ministry statement goes beyond any
 PARIS TALKS     previous protest from the ministry or its spokesman
 when it suggests that the air attacks may undermine
 the Paris talks. It calls the attacks "a violation of the U.S.
 commitment to stop completely the bombing of North Vietnam" and warns,
 in a later passage, that they "will seriously affect the Paris
 conference on Vietnam."*  Prefacing this warning is the assertion
 that "these U.S. war acts against the people of the DRV have further
 *  After the 1 November 1968 U.S. bombing halt, but before the opening
 of the expanded Paris talks in January 1969, several DRV Foreign
 Ministry protests over alleged U.S. attacks on the North charged that
 the actions were at variance with the U.S. bombing halt declaration.
 And a 26 February 1969 DRV Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement,
 responding to speculation about possible U.S. retaliation for communist
 action in the South, recalled the U.S. pledge to halt the bombing and
 charged that "by continuing to encroach upon DRV sovereignty and
 security, the Americans have violated their own commitment."

 laid bare the aggressive, extremely warlike and obdurate features
 cf the Nixon Administration" and "have exposed the hypocrisy of the
 deceptive talks on 'peace and goodwill' so often repeated" by the
 Administration.
 AIR STRIKES     A 2 May VPA High Command communique* claims that two
 ON 3, 4 MAY     U.S. planes were downed during the attack on Quang
 Binh on that date,.and a news report on the 3d claims
 two more planes downed that day as well as "many" hit by ground fire.
 The total of planes allegedly downed is substantially increased on
 5 May; a communique from the VPA High Command charges that U.S.
 planes carried out daily raids from 1 to 4 May against "populated
 areas and economic sites" and claims a total of 13 planes downed
 during those four days.  Pinpointing the areas allegedly attacked,
 it lists Quang Ninh, Le Thuy, Tuyen Hoa, and Ninh Hoa districts in
 Qu.ang Binh Province and Ky Son, Dien Chau, and Nghia Dan districts
 in Nghe An Province.
 A news report in Hanoi's domestic service on the 5th details the
 additional claims of downed planes.  It says that two F-105's were
 downed over Quang Binh on 4 May and that three had been brought
 down over Quang Binh on the 1st.  "According to an additional
 report," the radio states, Nghe An and Quang Binh armed forces and
 people brought down four more planes on 2 and 3 May.  Hanoi now
 claims that a total of 3,351 U.S. aircraft have be   downed over the
 North.
 The Administration's announcement of an end to the stepped-up bombing
 is acknowledged in a 5 May Hanoi domestic radio commentary.  The
 commentary says that a. Defense Department spokesman "was compelled"
 to declare a halt to the air raids, but that he "maintained a warlike
 tone" in saying the United States is ready to act whenever necessary
 to protect pilots flying reconnaissance aircraft over the North.
 "This indicated," the radio comments, "that the Americans have not yet
 renounced their scheme to stage air raids against the North whenever
 they deem it necessary."
 KOSYGIN READS GOVERNMENT STATEMENT ON CAMBODIA, AIR STRIKES
 Soviet reaction to the President's announcement is highlighted by
 nosygin's 4 March press conference at which he read the Soviet Government
 statement condemning the intrusion into Cambodia.  This is the first
 government statement on Indochina since that of 2 November 1968 which

 welcomed the halt of the U.S. bombing of the DAN and the expansion
 of the Paris talks.  The statement does not refer explicitly to
 Soviet aid, although it says that the President "uttered a threat
 addressed to those states that would decide to come forward in
 support of the victims of U.S. aggression."  And in response to
 a reporter's question, Kosygin says that the question of increased
 aid to the DRV "will obviously be reviewed."  The statement says
 that the U.S. escalation of aggression "makes even more urgent
 the need for uniting and strengthening the cohesion of all the
 socialist, anti-imperialist, and peace-loving forces."  It
 concludes with the vague assertion that the Soviet Government "will
 draw the appropriate conclusions for its policy" from the U.S.
 course of action in Southeast Asia.,
 The statement does not mention the Vietnamese communist presence,
 saying only that Washington justifies its move into Cambodia as
 "allegedly necessary for saving the lives of American soldiers"
 who are supposedly being "threatened by somebody."  In reply to a
 question on the subject, Kosygin said at his press conference:  "I
 am not informed about precisely how many Vietnamese troops there
 are in Cambodia, or if there are any there at all,"  But the U.S.
 press says, he added, "that American troops cannot find any Vietnamese
 troops in Cambodia at all."
 The government statement also denounces the recent bombings of the
 DRV by which it says the United States has "grossly violated the
 commitments undertaken in the agreement that served as a basis for
 the four-sided talks in Paris."  It adds that through the "war" in
 Cambodia and the bombings President Nixon has "practically cancelled
 out the recision of his predecessor, President Johnson, on the
 cessation of the bombing."  In his press conference, Kosygin avoided
 responding directly to a question on the USSR extending its good
 offices i?c help achieve a political settlement in Paris:  He said
 merely that  'he USSR welcomed the Paris meetings and that the
 United States is to blame for the lack of progress there.
 The government statement is followed up by a PRAVDA editorial on the
 5th which accuses the United States of using "scorched-earth tactics"
 in Cambodia and denounces the "barbaric air raids" on the DRV which
 contravene the U.S. undertaking on the bombing halt.
 TASS STATEMENT     Prior to the President's speech, Moscow had reacted
 to the 29 April announcement of a U.S.-supported
 South Vietnamese operation in Cambodia witn a 30 April TASS statement
 which charged that the American military had committed a "new act of
 aggression testifying that Washington wants to spread military actions

 throughout the whole of the Indochinese peninsula."        TASS denounced
 the United States for "flagrantly flouting  the 1954 Geneva agreements,
 and warned of a deteriorating situation throughout Southeast Asia.
 The statement expressed support for the joint declaration of the
 Indochinese people's summit conference, and asserted, as did Kosygin,
 ?       that the Soviet Union has always respected and respects the neutrality
 and independence, the soveriegnty and territorial integrity of
 Cambodia.
 OTHER COMMENT     Routine-level Moscow comment on the 29 April. announce-
 ment of the GVN operation similarly denounced the
 "unconcealed aggression" as leading to a "further exacerbation" of the
 situation in Indochina.  A radio commentary in English to North America
 by Afonin on 30 April says the U.S. penetration of Cambodia ",striki.ngly
 resembles" the escalation of the war in South Vietnam and Laos--with
 the United States first supplying weapons, then advisers and instructors
 and troops to protect them, and finally troops for combat missions.
 Moscow comment on President Nixon's speech before the release of the
 government statement glossed over the substance of the President's
 argument and condemned the "aggression" against Cambodia.   Soviet
 propaganda generally cites as U.S. motivation for the action the need
 to protect American troops in South Vietnam from "some kind of
 threat allegedly coming from Cambodia."  But Col. Aleksey Leontyev
 in a broadcast to North America on 3 May, without explictly mentioning
 the President, ridicules reports that "the Viet Cong and North
 Vietnamese troops are fighting the new regime in Cambodia."  And a
 Washington-datelined dispatch in PRAVDA on 1 May acknowledges that
 the announcement of the 29 April operation said the aim was "striking
 blows at the Viet Cong bases."
 Consistent with its glcssing over of the substance of the President's
 speech, Moscow does not discuss his promise to "do our best" to supply
 small arms and equipment to Lon Nol's forces for defense purposes.
 Earlier, Soviet propaganda criticized the United States for approving
 the dispatch of a shipment of weapons via South Vietnam and for
 considering Lon Nol's aid request.
 Statements denouncing the U.S. "i'avasion" of Cambodia have been issued
 by the Soviet peace committee and other organizations which express
 "support" for the "Just struggles" in Indochina and praise the
 Indochinese people's summit conference.  Beginning on 4 May, there a.e
 reports that mass protest meetings and rallies are being held in towns
 throughout the USSR.

 PRC CALLS ACTIONS IN CAMBODIA, AIR STRIKES "GRAVE STEP"
 In its reaction to President Nixon's announcement on military actions
 in Cambodia, Peking has continued its effort to associate its interests
 with the anti-U.S. forces in Indochina while leaving its commitments
 in the conflict vague and undefined.  A PRC Government statement on
 4 May--the second such statement on Cambodia in a week--assails both
 the actions in Cambodia and the "resiuned bombing" of the DRV as "an
 extremely grave step" by the United States to expand the war in
 Indochina.  The statement introduces a new element in authoritative
 Chinese comment on Indochinese developments by calling the U.S.
 actions "frantic provocations against the Chinese people" as well as against
 the Indochinese and other peoples., The statement does not,-however, assert
 a stronger Chinese commitment, pledging "powerful backing" and "all-out
 support and assistance"  to the Indochinese peoples and urging the latter
 to unite and persevere in protracted war.. It does not repeat the stronger
 warning contained in the 26 March PRC Foreign Ministry statement on Laos
 that the Chinese "will not sit idly by" in the face of U.S. actions there.
 A 5 May PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial follows up the statement by subjecting
 the President to virulent personal abuse as "an extremely ferocious
 war criminal" whose speech fully revealed "U.S. imperialism's arrogant,
 unreasonable, Machiavellian, and brazen features."  The editorial seems
 to pull back a step from the government statement in charging that the
 U.S. actions in Cambodia constitute a grave provocation against the
 people in Asia and the world but failing to specify China.  Its offer
 of Chinese support is similar to that in the statement and is in keeping
 with Peking's long-standing position on Vietnam, pledging "powerful
 backing" for the Indochinese countries and terming the PRC their
 "reliable rear area."
 Assessing the Nixon Administration's Asian polU..:.`Les in light of the
 new developments, the editorial observes that the "wishful thinking"
 underlying the Nixon Doctrine foresaw the use of "puppets and
 accomplices" but that events in Indochina forced the President,
 acting "desperately like a cornered dog," to send troops into Cambodia.
 *  The formula "all-out support and assistance" has not been commonly
 used in Peking's pronouncements recently, though Chou En-lai used the
 formula in defining the PRC's "duty and obligation" toward the
 Vietnamese in a speech before a visiting NFLSV delegation on 8 October
 1969 and at the 26 April banquet of the Indochinese summit conferees.
 A PRC Government statement dated 7 August 1965 pledged "all-out
 support and assistance" to the Vietnamese "up to and including the
 sending, according to their need, of our men to fight shoulder to
 shoulder with them to drive out the U.S. aggressors."

 The ed:.Lorial also claims that the decision has stripped off the
 Nixon Administration's "mask of 'peace'" and that it han no
 intention to withdraw U.S. troops from Vietnam.  The editorial does
 not draw any implications for China or other parts of Asia, portraying
 a situation in Indochina in which the United States will sink deeper
 into "the vast ocean of people's war" and encounter "a more disastrous
 defeat" at the hands of the Indochinese people.
 Peking's first reaction to the President's speech came in an NCNA
 dispatch dated 2 May cha'ging that the United States had initiated
 "a war of aggression" against Cambodia and denouncing the President
 in notably abusive terms as "an executioner whose hands are dripping
 with the blood" of the Indochinese people.  Assailing the President's
 rationale that the action was aimed at clearing out enemy sanctuaries
 in order to protect American troops in Vietnam, NCNA argued that
 according to this logic the United States may next attack "another
 county" under the pretext of protecting its personnel in some other
 place.  Neither this dispatch nor subsequent comment has mentioned
 the President's statement that the U.S. actions are in no way
 directed against the security interests of any nation.
 Quoting the President's remark that the United States will continue
 efforts to end the war at the conference table, the NCNA dispatch
 claimed that the President's aim is "to force the Indochinese peoples
 to sign a treaty of surrender."  This is the closest Peking has come
 in current comment to mentioning the Paris talks,  An NCNA report on
 the 2 May DRV statement denouncing U.S. air attacks in North Vietnam
 did not include the reference to the Paris talks, merely quoting the
 statement as saying that the raids exposed the hypocrisy of the Nixon
 Administration's "deceptive talks on 'peace'  and 'good will.'"
 SIHANOUK     Sihanouk's initial reaction to the President's speech
 REACTION     was contained in a press statement dated 2 May and
 transmitted by NCNA on the 14th. While quoting the
 President as explaining that the United States must clean out
 "Viet Cong and North Vietnamese sanctuaries" in Cambodia, Sihanouk's
 statement claims that the U.S. action was dictated by a need to
 preserve the life of the Lon Nol regime.  The statement cites--without
 subscribing to--the view attributed to the Western press that
 Cambodian forces fighting under the banner of the National, United
 Front of Kampuchea will isolate and then recapture Phnom Penh.
 In his own name Sihanouk predicts that 'the Vietnamese, Laotian,
 and Cambodian peoples, "having already formed an Indochina united
 front," will be able within the "next several weeks and months" to
 deal "telling blows and completely defeat" the United States and its
 "lackeys"  ri Phnom Penh, Saigon, and Vientiane.  The statement does
 not me)ition China.

 The statement renews the plea contained in an appeal by Sihanouk
 dated 30 April (carried by NCNA on the 2d), reacting to allied
 military incursion.- into Cambodia prior to the President's speech,
 that governments sever diplomatic relations with the Lon Nol
 regime.  It also mentions the Geneva agreements, charging that the
 United States has "deliberately destroyed" the agreements and
 pointing out that the danger to American soldiers will no longer
 exist "once Nixon makes the decision" to respect the Geneva
 agreements and to withdraw U.S. troops from Indochina.  The state-
 ment does not raise the question of a new conference on Indochina.
 MOSCOW, PEKING TRADE CHARGES ON INDOCHINA POLICY
 INTERNATIONAL     Following Peking's 24 April explicit criticism of
 CONFERENCE        Soviet UN representative Yakov Malik's remarks on
 a i,qw Geneva conference, Chou En-.lai makes an
 oblique attack on the Soviet position.  NCNA on 3 May carries a
 speech Chou delivered at the 26 April banquet, at the conclusion of
 the Indochinese summit, in which he charged that the United States
 is trying to sabotage the Indochinese peoples' united struggle by
 means of a "so-called peaceful settlement of the Indochina question
 through the convocation of international conferences."  In a thinly
 veiled allusion to the Soviets, Chou added that "some people have
 expressed in words" their support for the Cambodian people's struggle
 but "facts have proved that they are tailing closely after U.S.
 imperialism."
 A Moscow Radio Peace and Progress broadcast in Mandarin on the
 27th had responded to Peking's 24 April criticism of Soviet "collusion"
 with the United States, though without acknowledging the reference
 to Malik.  And a Moscow broadcast in Mandarin on 3 May says that NCNA
 has "spread a rumor that the Soviet Union made a proposal at the
 United Nations on the Cambodian issue" which was "warmly welcomed"
 by U.S. imperialism.  Thus, Moscow still failed to acknowledge
 that the point at issue was a new international conference.
 It was left to Kosygin in his 4 May press conference to break Soviet
 silence on a Geneva conference.*  In response to a question from a
 Moscow radio correspondent, Kosygin said that "the decisive word"
 rests with the Indochinese, but he went on to observe that now seems
 the time not for meetings but for actions "to stop the U.S. intervention
 *  TASS had reported the 1 April French proposal on possible broad
 negotiations on Indochina as well as the 10 April comments on the
 proposal by Le Duc Th~3, DRV adviser to the Paris delegation.

 in Cambodia."  Kosygin echoed other recent Moscow propaganda when he
 said "we have a negative attitude"-toward Indonesia's proposal for a
 "conference of U.S. allies" on Cambodia.  Moscow has apparently not
 acknowledged that Asian communist countries had been invited to the
 conference scheduled for mid-May in Djakarta.   TASS on 5 May notes
 that such neutral countries as India, Burma, and Ceylon have rejected
 Indonesian Foreign Minister Adam Malik's invitation.
 SOCIALIST            A 5 May Mandarin-language Radio Peace and Progress
 "UNITED ACTION"      broadcast cites the appeal in the Soviet Government
 statement "for uniting and strengthening the
 cohesion" of socialist and other peace-loving forces.  And it goes on
 to say that "more than once" the Soviet Union and other socialist
 countries proposed to the Chinese leadership "the holding of tripartite
 talks by the Soviet Union, China, and Vietnam and summit meetings among
 the socialist countries to provide support to the DRV," all of which
 were turned down by the PRC.  The commentary adds that the inception
 of U.S. bombing in February 1965 gave rise to the proposal that "all
 socialist countries issue a joint statement" condemning the United
 States and supporting the DRV, but that the Chinese leadership opposed
 it.
 BACKGROUND:  On 3 March 1965 a statement on Vietnam issued by the
 19-party consultative meeting in Moscow said that "the Marxist-Leninist
 parties regard it as their international duty to strive for the
 unity of action of all progressive and democratic forces in order
 to render resolute support to the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese
 people."  In February 1966 Tirana had disclosed that in January the
 Polish Central Committee sent a message to the PRC regarding a bloc
 meeting on the coordination of aid to the DRV and NFLSV and had
 asked for bloc support of such a meeting.  In March 1966 the Hamburg
 DIE WELT carried excerpts of a "secret" CPSU letter which said that
 the CPSU had twice proposed a tripartite summit meeting on coordination
 of aid.*  Moscow propaganda has on rare occasions referred to these
 initiatives in general terms similar to the current commentary.
 "ROYAL GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNION" OF CAMBODIA ANNOUNCED
 Peking media reported on 5 May that at a press conference that day
 Sihanouk read a proclamation announcing the formation of a new
 government--the "Royal Government of National Union under the

 leadervhip of the National United Front of Kamphchea" (FUNK).*  The
 proclamation says that pursuant to Sihanouk's 23 March statement, an
 "extraordinary congress" was held in Peking attended by "qualified
 representatives of various circles of Cambodia," and the government
 was founded with Penn Nouth as prime minister.  The proclamation
 states that the tasks of the new government, as spelled out in the
 March statement, are to unite the people in the struggle to oppose
 U.S. aggression and overthrow the rule of Lon Not and Sirik Matak
 and, after the winning of victory, to establish an independent,
 peaceful, neutral, democratic, and prosperous Cambodia.  The new
 government reportedly will "absolutely, respect" all international
 agreements, treaties, and pacts entered into before the 18 March
 coup.  The belief is also expressed that the government will
 receive "militant sympathy and fraternal support" and will be
 recognized as the only legal government of Cambodia.
 Other Peking broadcasts list the names of the 12-member government
 and the 11-member political bureau of FUNK.  The new government and FUNK
 political bureau   include members of Sihanouk's entourage, former
 ambassadors who rallied to Sihanouk, and three former National Assembly
 deputies who had vanished three years ago after being accused by
 Sihanouk of being Khmer Reds.   (On 10 April VNA had carried a statement
 by the three former deputies expressing "full support" for Sihanouk's
 23 April proclamation.)
 Peking media also carry the political program of FUNK which was
 reportedly adopted at the congress and made public by Sihanouk at
 the press conference.  The aim of the program, to develop the five-
 point declaration made by Sihanouk on 23 March, is to realize the
 broadest national union for fighting the American imperialists;
 "overthrow" the Lon Nol-Sirik Matak "dictatorship"; defend the
 independence, peace, neutrality, sovereignty, and territorial
 integrity of the country within its present frontiers; and build
 a "free and democratic regime of the people."  FUNK, says the
 program, "coordinates" its struggle with that of the fraternal
 peoples of Vietnam and Laos on the principle that "the liberation and
 defense of each c-untry are the affairs of its own people and that
 the mutual suppc. t among the three peoples must be based on mutual
 respect."
 *  A fuller NCNA report of the press conference on 6 May cites
 Sihanouk as saying that the government is "not a government in exile
 because it has its basis at home.  We have our army at home.  When-
 ever we liberate a village, a county, or a city we will set up a
 legitimate administration there."

 On foreign policy the program notes FUNK's adherence to the standard
 principles of national independence, peace, neutrality, nonalinement
 and solidarity and friendship with all peace-loving peoples and
 governments.   It also affirms adherence to the five principles of
 peaceful coexistence and the "spirit" of the UN Charter, adding that
 it will not join any military alliance.  The program repeats,
 without attribution, the pledge in the joint declaration of the
 summit conference that each of the three Indochinese states will
 assist each of the others according to the wishes of the country
 concerned.  Cambodia, it says, "is ready to make concerted efforts
 with Laos and Vietnam to make Indochina genuinely a zone of
 independence, peace, and progress."
 RECOGNITION OF    The government proclamation, first carried in the
 GOVERNMENT         Peking domestic service at 1121 GMT, was followed
 six ;i1inutes later by another domestic service
 broadcast of a letter from Chou En-lai announcing that the PRC
 Government "formally recognizes" the new government as the only legal
 government of the people of Cambodia.   The letter is addressed to
 Sihanouk as head of state of Cambodia and chairman of FUNK and to
 Penn Nouth as prime minister of the new government.  The letter
 states that the PRC formally severs all diplomatic relations with the
 Lon Nol-Sirik Matak "righ?L;ist renegade clique" and will withdraw
 its diplomatic agencies, personnel, and specialists from Phnom Penh.
 Chou notes that the new government was founded at the "critical
 juncture when U.S. imperialism has blatantly invaded Cambodia" and
 declares that the Cambodian people's anti-U.S. patriotic struggle
 has "entered a new historic stage."  He expresses confidence that the
 Cambodian people and their new government, "united with the fraternal
 people of Vietnam and Laos" and supported by peace-loving countries
 and peoples of the world, "persevering in armed struggle and in
 protracted struggle," will certainly win final victory.
 DRV recognition of the new government as "the sole legitimate and legal
 government of Cambodia" comes in a 6 May message from Pham Van Dong
 to Penn Nouth.  A congratulatory message the same day to Sihanouk
 from Ton Duc Thang and Pham Van Dong invokes the "sacred provisions"
 of the joint declaration of the Indochinese summit conference in
 reaffirming the "promise" of the Vietnamese people, Fatherland Front,
 and DRV Government "to do their best to strengthen their militant
 solidarity with the fraternal Khmer until total victory."  The DRV
 leaders claim that the new government and the political bureau of
 FUNK "faithfully" represent the will and aspirations of all social
 strata and political tendencies among the Cambodian people, noting
 also that FUNK has "at its disposal vigorous armed forces and possesses
 vast liberated regions."

 Within an hour of the initial Peking domestic service announcement,
 'PASS carried a brief report of the proclamation of the new government
 and of the FUNK political program, specifying that the congress was
 held on 3-4 May.  Thus far, Moscow has made no mention of recognition.
 At his It May press conference Kosygin called Sihanouk the "lawful
 head of state" but acknowledged that he had been "removed."  The
 Soviet premier avoided a direct answer to a question as to which
 Cambodian government the USSR recognizes, saying merely:  "We
 recognize the neutralist government of Cambodia.  We recognize an
 the government of Cambodia the one which pursues a policy of peace
 and not a policy of war."
 At this writing, other countries which have announced recognition of
 the new government include Albania, Cuba, Syria, and Iraq.  North
 Korea's Kim Il-song sent Sihanouk a message "welcoming" the new
 government as the "sole, legal government of Cambodia."  Similarly,
 Romania's President Ceausescu, according to the Bucharest domestic
 service on 5 May, sent Sihanouk a telegram expressing "congratulations"
 on the founding of the new government without specifically referring
 to recognition.  Radio Belgrade reported on 6 May that the Federal
 Executive Council that day "took a decision on the official
 recognition of the Royal Government of National Unity of Cambodia."

 HANOI ATTENTION TO MAY DAY, HO CHI MINH BIRTH ANNIVERSARY
 North Vietnamese media report that a meeting was held in Hanoi on the
 evening of 30 April to mark 1 May labor. day.  Among those attending
 were Ton Due Tilting, Truona, Chinh, 11hum Van Dong, and Vo Nguyen Giap.
 (The VNA English-language account of the meeting lists Phwn Van Dong
 ahead of Truong Chinh, but the usual order--placing 'T'ruong Chinh
 after T'tiang--is used in Ilanoi'o Vietnamese-'language radio and VNA
 transmissions.)  Opening remarks were offered by Phani Van Dong and
 Lhe main speech was given by Iioang Quoc Viet, president of the
 Vietnam Federation of Trade Unions.  Both speakers took the occasion
 to call attention to the recent Indochina summit conference and to
 score U.S. policy as outlined in President Nixon's 20 April speech
 on the withdrawal of another 150,000 U.S. troops from Vietnam.  'bong
 declared, among other things, that the conference was a "stern
 answer" to the U.S. policy of Vietnamization and to "the other
 imperialist countries and the reactionaries in some countries in
 Asia who are trying by every means to serve the policy of intervention
 and aggression of the U.S. imperialists in Indochina and Cambodia
 and legalize the Lon Nol-Sirik Matak fascist raci*,t clique."
 The 1 May NIfAN DAN editorial similarly scored "reactionary ruling
 circles in a number of Asian countries" which are "attempting to get
 together to save the U.S. and its henchmen."  Noting the Vietnamese
 people's dedication to strengthening their own solidarity and the
 solidarity of the Indochinese peoples, the editorial adds that they
 also endeavor to contribute to the "restoration and strengthening of
 the solidarity and unity of mind in the socialist camp and among
 fraternal parties."
 Hanoi on 2 May releases slogans commemorating Ho Chi Minh's 80th
 birth anniversary--on 19 May--and a 29 April party Central Committee
 Secretariat instruction on the anniversary.
 SOUTH MARKS MAY DAY, SOUTHERN TRADE UNION ANNIVERSARY
 The two workers' anniversaries--May Day and the 27 April anniversary
 of the South Vietnam Liberation Trade Union Federation--prompt a
 flurry of propaganda hailing the workers' struggle.  The commentaries,
 praising the solidarity of the workers' movement, all claim that the
 movement has developed greatly in recent months.  LPA says on the 30th
 that a number of GVN assembly deputie'i have been won over to the
 workers' side.  A Hanoi radio commentary on the 1st claims that, along
 with the struggle movement, the workers "have positively participated

 A May Day appeal to the Saigon people from the Saigon municipal people's
 revolutionary committee, broadcast by Hanoi on the 30th, declares that

 1 to 26 April, with 2,467 allies annihilated, including 35 U.S.
 advisors.  At Dak Seang alone more than 230 were annihilated, accord-

 U. S, -- SOVIET                       RELATIONS
 SOVIET STATEMENT DENOUNCES U.S. FOR RELIANCE ON FORCE
 The Soviet Government statement read by Kosygin at his televised news
 conference in Moscow on 4 May constitutes, overall, the USSR's
 strongest official attack to date on the Nixon Administration's
 policies.  Particularly striking is the observation that "it is
 obvious that the U.S. Administration is following an aggressive
 course in its policy, proceeding from the assumption that a mighty
 power cannot act in international affairs in any other way but by
 the use of force."
 The statement stops short of declaring flatly that the incursion
 of U.S. troops into Cambodia will have an adverse effect on U.S.-
 Soviet relations, a formulation which Kosygin and other Soviet
 spokesmen have used in speeches in the past in regard to the U.S.
 "aggression" in Vietnam.  But the statement says that the actions
 in Cambodia "may further complicate the overall international
 situation," and it asks rhetorically how one is to understand the
 President's repeated statements on moving from an era of confrontation
 to one of negotiation.  It goes on to question whether it is
 possible to talk seriously about the President's desire for fruitful
 talks to solve urgent international problems at a time when
 Washington is "crudely trampling on" the 1954 and 1962 Geneva
 accords and is "undertaking more and more new actions that
 undermine the mainstays of international security."
 In what may be interpreted as a reference to the strategic arms
 limitation talks in Vienna, the statement further questions the
 value of an international agreement to which the United Statpa
 subscribes "or to which it is prepared to subscribe if it
 unceren:,)niously violates the obligations it assumes."
 In response to a question from a correspondent of the Bulgarian
 RABOTNICHESKO DELO regarding the reported observation by a White
 House spokesman that the USSR "must weigh the entire complex of
 mutual relations"--including the Vienna talks--in reacting to the
 U.S. "tactical invasion" of Cambodia, Kosygin said that the President
 is ."in fact attempting to threaten us to some extent."  It would have
 been better, Kosygin added, if the President had "weighed his actions"
 before moving into Cambodia.  Responding to a question from a West
 German correspondent on the possibility of the Vienna talks breaking
 up as a result of the actions in Cambodia, Kosygin reaffirmed that
 the Soviet delegation went to Vienna to hold "serious talks."  He
 stated that the talks must take place in an atmosphere of trust, but
 "at a time when agreements are broken, when there is such an informal
 attitude vis-a-vis all sorts of international laws, of course this
 arouses watchfulness on our part, and one must say that these actions
 by the United States do nct strengthen mutual trust."

 SING-SOVIET  RELATIONS
 In the aftermath of the polemical evchanges at the time of the Lenin
 centenary celebrations, both sidc:_       signalled their intent to keep
 the Sino-Soviet talks alive and, by implication, to keep tensions along
 the border under control.  At his press conference on 4 May Premier
 Kosygin, in reply to an Italian correspondent who asked when the talks
 would be resumed, denied that the talks had been broken off and remarked
 ?         that the question had not arisen from either side.  Earlier, NCNA's
 report on May Day celebrations in Peking attended by Mao singled out
 the presence of the deputy chief of the Soviet delegation at the talks.
 There had been no announcement on Sovie'. chief negotiator Kuznetsov's
 return to Moscow, in contrast to the time of his return last December
 when Peking issued an announcement designed to put pressure on the
 Soviets to have Kuznetsov resume participation in the negotiations.
 Peking's May Day celebrations included only passing polemical jabs at
 the Soviets.  The PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial, drawing inspiration from the
 launching of the PRC's first earth satellite, aimed a characteristic
 barb at "Brezhnev and company" for having predicted that China would
 find the going impossible unless it joined Moscow's socialist community--
 "that is, unless it became a dependeti^v cf bocial imperialism."
 SOVIET POLEMICS CONCENTRATED IN BROADCASTS TO THE PRC
 While Soviet broadcasts to China sustain their virulent attacks on
 Mao and his policies and vigorously prei3s Moscow's ideological views,
 more authoritative comment has played down the China question and
 avoided the border dispute.  Kosygin's 4 May remarks on the Peking
 talks, observing that the Soviets are approaching the matter
 "constructively" and are discussing "a whole number of questions"
 with the Chinese, failed to criticize the Chinese attitude and
 struck a note of moderation reminiscent of Soviet comments soon
 after the talks opened last October,  There has been no renewal of
 charges made by Brezhnev and Kirilenko on 14 April that Peking's
 anti-Soviet campaign impairs the talks.
 Brezhnev's brief May Day speech did not mention China.  Sino-Soviet
 tensions were aired, however, by Khabarovsk party chief Shitikov in
 his May Day speech carried by the Khabarovsk radio.  Reflecting
 that border region's special concern with events in China, he
 denounced the anti-Soviet campaign and war hysteria in China as the
 product of the "great-power chauvinistic policy of the Mao Tse-tung
 clique."*

 the commander of the Far Eastern Military District, V.F. Tolubko, was one
 of three officers to be promoted to army general, according to RED STAR on
 1 May.

 The border issue is raised in an article on China in LIFE ABROAD No. 18
 (1 May) by German communist Otto Braun.  Entitled "Shots on the Ussuri
 and the Maoists," the article was excerpted from his memoirs and was
 published earlier in a GDR weekly.  Braun depicts Mao as a cunning,
 power-hungry  individual who liquidates party members opposed to his
 policies, vacillates between the United States and the Soviet Union,
 and, as confirmed by the CCP's ninth congress, has "finally and
 irrevocably departed from Marxism-Leninism."
 Soviet broadcasts beamed co China, accounting for the bulk of current
 Soviet comment on the PRC, follow standard themes in seeking to exploit
 discontent among such groups as the Chinese youth, national minorities,
 intellectuals, and the PLA.  Although the recently resumed attacks on
 Mao by name are carried by both Radio Moscow and the purportedly
 unofficial Radio Peace and Progress, commentaries containing malicious
 personal abuse directed at Mao and his entourage are broadcast only by
 Radio Peace and Progress.  Pointed efforts to arouse anti-Peking
 sentiment among the non-Han peoples are illustrated by Mongolian
 broadcasts over Radio Peace and Progress seeking to promote resentment
 against Maoist policies and anti-Soviet activities in Inner Mongolia
 and charging that Mao v ants to annex the MPR.,

 MIDDLE  EAST
 KOSYGIN ACKNOWLEDGES SOVIET "MILITARY ADVISERS" ARE IN UAR
 Responding to a correspondent's request that he confirm or deny the
 Israeli Government's 29 AT_il charge that Soviet pilots are taking
 part in operational missions in Egypt, Kosygin acknowledged at his
 4 May press conference that under an agreement with the UAR Government
 ?        "our military advisers are attached to the UAR troops."  He explained
 that the object is to "combat Israeli aggression," which is occurring
 "only because of the great assistance of the United States."  As for
 the advisers' responsibilities and assignments, he said only that
 "the respective fuulctions of our military advisers are being
 coordinated with the UAR Government."  Moscow thus far apparently
 has not seen fit to give Kosygin's statement any further publicity;
 rather, it is countering with revived charges that citizens of the
 United States and other Western countries are serving in the Israeli
 forces,
 Prior to Kosygin's remark, the meager Soviet propaganda response to
 Israel's charge concerning Soviet pilots hr..d dealt with it--as Cairo
 did--in roundabout fashion, ignoring the substance.  TASS on 30 April
 reported the UAR official spokesman as "speaking about the anti-Arab
 and anti-Soviet campaign fanned up" in Israel.  Belyayev in the 1 May
 PRAVDA rioted the "unprecedented political furore" in Israel but brushed
 over the nature of the charges in elain.ing that "the deliberately false
 allegations about the Soviet Union" are "unfounded."  He insisted that
 the Soviet Union "firmly and consistently" supports a peaceful
 settlement, with Israeli withdrawal as the "cornerstone" of such a
 solution.  Noting that Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban "threatened
 that Egyptian resistance to the aggressor's provocations" must lead
 to fulfillment by the United States of its undertaking to insure
 Israel's security, Belyayev said "observers" interpreted this as a
 signal of Israel's desire to secure new Phantoms and Skyhawks.  He
 referred to the British GUARDIAN's comment that Israel was exerting
 pressure not only for more jet planes but also "to get wider American
 participation in the operations against the Arabs," and he noted news
 agency reports that the Egyptian forces "recently increased their
 resistance" to the Israeli "provocations "
 In PRAVDA on 4 May, Mayevskiy also sidestepped the issue of Soviet
 pilots in remarking on Israel's "new anti-Soviet and anti-Egyptian
 provocations."  He cited the Cairo AL-AHRAM as saying that Israel
 tries to "present the matter in such a way as if 'the technical and
 strategic successes achieved by the Egyptian air force and ground
 troops are not Egypt?'s-own;aotions.'"  Such statements are calculated
 to get additional U.S. military assistance, he said, claiming that

 Tel Aviv relies in vain on military pressure on the Arabs, whose
 armed forces "accumulate experience and deal ever stronger. blows at
 the Israeli occulauion forces."     Washington seems to have expected
 new complaints from Tel Aviv and "expressed 'a serious concern,"'
 Mayevskiy added.  He remarked that it was hardly possible to rule
 out further U.S. steps in support of Israeli policy, thus creating
 an impetus for further prolonging the Middle East conflict,
 BACKGROUND     Moscow indicated the presence of "Soviet experts" in
 the UAR on at least one occasion in the past, in an
 Arabic-language broadcast on 9 November 1969 dealing with Nasir's
 6 November speech to the UAR National Assembly.  The broadcast
 said Nasir "once again mentioned that the Soviet Union is the
 Arabs' friend and is giving them the necessary weapons; Soviet
 experts are giving their knowledge on the use of these weapons."
 When Nasir discussed his request for "the deployment of Soviet
 experts with the armed forces" in some detail in a 27 March speech
 last year, TASS in reporting this speech merely noted that he
 "pointed to the great role the Soviet Union played in strengthening
 the UAR's defense potential."
 There are few other available propaganda suggestions of a Soviet
 role encompassing more than arms deliveries.  A Moscow Arabic-
 language broadcast last October said "it is known" that the Soviet
 Union aids the Arabs militarily not only by supplying arms "but
 also by providing extensive fighting experience."  And the Moscow
 domestic service on 10 January this year referred to a RED STAR
 article by an air force officer who said the USSR was assisting the
 Vietnamese and Arab struggles with Soviet "experience and weapons. "
 In the past few months Soviet propaganda has adhered to the standard
 line that the USSR will continue supplying the "necessary aid" to
 enable the Arabs to "increase their defense strength."  The 16 February
 TASS statement declared that "as long as" Israel "tramples underfoot"
 the UN decision, the Soviet Union will "render the necessary support"
 to the Arab states in "strengthening their ability to uphold their
 security "
 "VOLUNTEERS" IN   The charge that the United States is "allowing"
 ISRAELI FORCES    American citizens to fight in the Israeli army
 was resurfaced by Soltan in a 30 April foreign-
 language commentary built on the theme that Washington will be
 reconsidering its decision on further deliveries of planes to
 Israel.  The charge of U.S. citizens' participation in the Israeli
 forces has appeared sporadically in the propaganda since the initial
 exploitation of the issue last fall.  A Tsoppi commentary in January,
 for example, claimed that South African pilots, "together with American

 fliers, are bombing Arab cities and villages," and Glukhov asserted
 in the 29 March PRAVDA that "American citizens have been authorized
 to serve in the Israeli army."
 TASS on 25 April picked up a Cairo AL-AHRAM report that the UAR
 Government had "authentic information" on British servicemen in
 the Israeli armed forces.  And on 3 May TASS cited the Cairo
 weekly ROSE AL-YUSUF as saying that as many as 3,500 foreigners
 from 12 countries, including the United States, Britain, South
 Africa, Canada, and Australia, serve with the Israeli forces.
 Commenting on the ROSE AL-YUSUF report,a Moscow domestic service
 commentary asserts on 5 May that Washington, London, and Bonn are
 "carefully concealing their military cadre assistance to Israel";
 Western officials, it says, deny that there are any American and
 British citizens or other foreign subjects in the Israeli army,
 claiming that there are only people who came from Western countries
 and took Israeli citizenship.  This, the broadcast flatly says, "is
 a lie; nearly 15,000 regular officers, who are called volunteers,
 are serving in the Israeli army" and have no thought of renouncing
 their "American or, say, West German citizenship."  The "volunteers
 serve," the broadcast adds, in the Israeli air force, navy, and
 armored troops and "pabticipate in military operations."  The
 commentary says it is clear that any Western government has only to
 raise its finger to end the recruiting of its citizens for the Israeli
 army, but "the whole point is precisely that many Western countries
 help Israel in every possible way."

 AUSTRIA
 6 MAY 1970
 MOSCOW CAUTIOUS ON SOCIALISTS, REAFFI,MS OPPOSITION TO EEC
 Initial Moscow comment on Austria's first minority government, farmed
 by the Socialist Party on 20 April, reflects traditional Soviet
 antipathy toward Austrian efforts to associate with the Common
 Market and concern that Austria's "permanent neutrality" be preserved.
 Moscow's treatment of the Socialists now, as the new ruling party,
 is markedly more reserved than in April 1966, when Soviet media
 openly blamed the Socialists' "anticommunism" and their "slanderous,
 fabricated" anti-Soviet slogans for 'their election losses and the
 installation of an exclusively People's Party government.  The tone
 of Soviet propaganda noticeably softened in broadcasts to Austria
 following the failure of efforts to form another grand coalition
 between the Socialists and the People's Party,  By contrast, East
 German comment registers strong skepticism and suspicion that the
 two dominant parties may yet establish a coalition aimed at "decFivirg"
 Austrian voters,
 MOSCOW ON EEC      A Zakharov commentary broadcast to Austrian listeners
 AND NEUTRALITY     on 29 April typifies Moscow comment on the new
 Socialist government.  Discussing at length the
 important role played by neutral countries in promoting European
 security and cooperation, Zakharov concludes that a "positive" Austrian
 role in this endeavor would yield "the most positive results" for
 Austria's own prosperity and security.  Optimism would be unjustified,
 he warns, if the new government "were to stake its hopes on participation
 in the so-called 'little European integration."'
 Zakharov points out that the EEC's ultimate aim is political union and
 repeats the standard Soviet warning that participation in such "economic
 and political integration" would be "absolutely incompatible" with
 Austria's neutral status.  He does not, however, raise the usual
 specter of "West German monopoly interests" controlling the EEC and
 seeking to infiltrate further into the Austrian economy.  The
 commentary lays stress on various negative aspects of an EEC
 association status for Austria, concluding that Austria would be
 "merely the seventh wheel of this no longer up-to-date vehicle" at
 the price of granting the EEC's biggest monopolies a "privileged
 position" in Austrian markets.
 An earlier Zakharov commentary for Austrian listeners, on the 24th,
 argued along similar lines and also stressed the value of trade with
 non-EEC countries, claiming that Austria's economy "derives incomparably
 more advantages" from trade with the East, the EFTA countries, nonmembers
 of the EEC, and non-European countries,  An Austrian association with the

 EEC "could never even come near making good the losses" Austria
 might suffer in these other markets, the commentator declared.
 Soviet press comment in mid-April, prior to the breakdown of
 Socialist and People's Party coalition negotiations, used the
 25th anniversary of Vienna's liberation from "German fascist
 invaders" for strong reminders about the importance of Austrian
 neutrality and repeatedly mentioned "large-scale infiltration" of
 West German capital, accompanied by an "ideological offensive" and
 the financing of rightwing parties.  An IZVESTIYA article on 12 April
 blatantly called it "a strange position, to say the least," when "some
 people in Austria" try to "define the country's neutrality L. their
 own way" and even "declare that the alpine republic itself will
 determine the extent of its obligations under the state treaty."  The
 article included a reminder that the four major powers "guarantee"
 Austria's neutrality and an admonition that "only strict observation"
 of the state treaty and neutrality can protect the country against "any
 unpleasant events" and insure independent development.
 SKEPTICAL COMMENT     Although recent East German propaganda on the
 FROM EAST GERMANY     GDR's own activities aimed at promoting relations
 with Austria suggests a moderate approach, a
 22 April East Berlin radio comment by Wolker expressed fundamental
 skepticism about the trend in Austria's policies even after announcement
 of the Socialist minority government.  Wolker noted that despite the
 abortive negotiations with the People's Party, the Socialist leadership
 "does not at all reject a coalition with this bourgeois party" and
 that the talk continues about renewing coalition negotiations this
 summer.
 Wolker concluded that behind these "statements, assurances, and
 political maneuvers" are indications that the two parties have agreed
 to set up "a new model of governing" that is really very old and has
 proved "excellently suited for the deception of the voters."  He pointed
 to the examples of the United States and Britain where, he said, the
 two parties exchange roles as political conditions change.  Conceding
 that the Socialist party "could" bring about announced social reforms,
 Wolker concluded that the Austrian Socialists mast still prove their
 determination to do so.

 SPANISH  CP  AND                   CPSU
 COMMUNIQUE ON MOSCOW TALKS SKIRTS CONTENTIOUS ISSUES
 FBIS TRENDS
 6 MAY 1970
 Controversial icsues separating the Spanish Communist Party and the
 CPSU are evaded in a communique released by Soviet media on 2 May,
 after a high-level meeting in Moscow on 29 April.  In addition to
 generally -:.gnf)ring controversial subjects, the communique contains
 several indications that the Spanish party has been prevailed upon to
 soften its anti-Soviet stance?  A less than fully harmonious encounter
 is suggested, however, by the communique's description of the atmosphere
 as one of "frankness, mutual respect, and comradeship."
 The Spanish CP has antagonized Moscow by its continuing outspoken
 opposition to the invasion of Czechoslovakia and its advocacy of a
 uniquely Spanish model of socialism.  On the other hand, Spanish
 communists have evinced dismay over signs that Moscow and its East
 European allies are moving toward a rapprochement with the Franco regime,
 as well as cver indications that Moscow is supporting the splitting
 activities of two pro-Soviet dissidents, Eduardo Garcia and Agustin Gomez,
 who were dropped from party leadership positions last July and expelled
 from the party in December.*
 The importance    cow assigns! to patching up relations with dissident
 West European parties was underscored by the prominence of the Soviet
 representation, which included CPSU secretaries and Politburo members
 Suslov and Kirilenko and party secretary Ponomarev.  Party Chairman
 Dolores Ibarruri and Secretary General Santiago Carillo led the Spanish
 CP delegation.
 While staying away from the sore point of Czechoslovakia, the communique
 proclaims general Spanish CP "support for the peaceloving foreign policy
 of the USSR."  It says "both delegations stress the great importance of
 the results of the international conference of communist and workers
 parties in 1969," and it uses the ambiguous formulation that inter-
 national communist unity must be assured by "respect for the independence
 of communist and workers parties in the irreconcilable struggle against
 imperialist ideology and any manifestations of opportunism."  The Spanish
 party signed the main document on the 1969 international party conference,
 but only after Carrillo expressed his party's "serious reservations" about
 it in his speech to the conclave.

 The communique makes no reference to the issue of the socialist states'
 dealings with Franco--anathema to the Spanish party--but refers vaguely
 to the necessity for intensifying "the joint struggle of both parties . . .
 against the hotbeds of fascism in Spain, Portugal, and Greece" and
 expresses CPSU solidarity with the Spanish CP's efforts to unify the
 "progressive and democratic forces of Spain with the aim of establishing
 a democratic system in the country."
 A Spanish CP Executive Committee statement last January had evinced
 concern over reports of the Spanish Foreign Minister's Moscow meeting
 and called upon Poland to refuse -to sell coal to the Franco regime that
 would be used to offset a shortage stemming from a strike of Asturian
 miners.  Since then the Spanish party has frequently admonished socialist
 states to refrain from dealings with Franco.  Thus, an Executive Committee
 May Day statement carried by the party's clandestine Radio Espana
 Independiente on 30 April appealed "to the comrades of the socialist
 countries not to take any political steps which might be interpreted
 as a rapprochement with or recognition of the Franco regime."  The
 Spanish CP's agitation had little effect.  The Poles apparently ignored
 its call last January for a Polish disclaimer on the proposed coal
 shipment to Spain.  At the French CP Congress in February French party
 dissident Roger Garaudy attacked the Poles--without directly naming
 them--for assisting Franco's strike-breaking activities by shipping the
 coal.  And on 27 April Spain's EFE agency reported that the Polish
 deputy minister of commerce had arrived in Madrid "to sign commercial,
 economic, navigation, and industrial cooperation treaties."
 PRO-SOVIET     Articles in the Si.anish party organ MUNDO OBRERO by
 DISSIDENTS     Carrillo and Ibarruri, broadcast by Radio Espana
 Independiente, have registered the party's continuing
 concern over the splitting activities of ousted pro-Soviet dissidents
 Garcia and Gomez.  In an article broadcast on 29 March, Carrillo
 indicated that the schismatics were calling for the party to hold "a
 democratic congress."  Undoubtedly aware that the dissidents hoped to
 use such a congress to oust the present party leadership, Carrillo
 argued that a democratic congress was "impossible" while the party
 continued to operate under clandestine conditions,
 Alleging that the "splitting work" of the pair had exposed the party
 to "police repression," Carrillo cited an instance in which Madrid
 communist students learned that police patrolling the university were
 instructed "that a leaflet by Eduardo Garcia and Agustin Gomez was
 to be distributed at the university grounds and that they should
 not prevent its distribution."  Although Carrillo stated that, the
 police had prepared the leaflet themselves and that the two dissidents
 "had nothing to do with this," he concluded with the admonition that
 "all splitting activities are used by the police as provocations against

 the party."  He denied that the party's failure tu ,.blicize the
 platform of the oplitters signified a reversal of its committment
 to open political discussion, declaring:
 We did not publish their platform because it was not
 really a theoretical political exposition; it was a
 list of insults and slanders against the Central
 Committee.  Moreover, the splitters, having an excess
 of funds, had already published it,
 Carrillo's reference to the dissidents' abundant funds could be read
 as an oblique allusion to Soviet material support.
 Ib arruri's article, broadcast on 7 April, did not directly refer to
 the dissidents, but it was clear that she had them and their
 supporters in mind when she referred to views in the party "which
 are foreign to democratic centralism and tend to introduce in our
 ranks the idea that the party leadership should accept the opinion of
 a group or of a basic organization even if it is wrong or contrary to
 party norms,"  She promised that such tendencies would be "liquidated,"
 since "they entail conceptions foreign to the organic and political
 structure of the party, based on democratic centralism."
 DISSIDENT EUROPEAN PARTIES BACK SPANISH COMUNISTS
 European parties which approve of the Spanish CP's opposition to the
 invasion of Czechoslovakia and share its espousal of pluralistic roads
 to socialism have demonstrated their support.  Thus, in marking the
 50th anniversary of the founding of the Spanish party on 15 April,
 the Romanian party sent a particularly cordial greetings message which
 commended the Spanish communists for efforts "to overcome the current
 difficulties" in the international communist movement and to develop
 interparty relations on the basis "of equality and noninterference in
 the internal affairs of other parties."*  A SCINTEIA article on the
 anniversary lauded the Spanish communists for backing a unity "based
 on the complete independence of parties to work out their political
 line and on the application of the general principles of Marxism-
 Leninism to concrete conditions in every country."  SCINTEIA approvingly
 quoted MUNDO OBRERO as affirming that while each party must obey the
 principle of democratic centralism internally, "in the international
 movement it is impossible to proceed from this principle."
 *  The CPSU greetings message included the admonition that "the struggle
 against any manifestations of opportunism and revisionism" is the
 guarantee of "success for the entire communist movement and each of its
 detachments."

 Yugoslav approval for the Spunioh CP's independent line was
 manifested in laudatory treIALrnent of the party In a 31 March
 BORBA supplement on the West European parties.  An article on
 the Spanish CP by Badivoj Nikolic noted that It "argues the
 conception of political pluralism on the road toward socialism,
 particularly in the developed countries, as distinguished from
 revolutions which have developed in different situations."  Nikolic
 stressed the Spanish party's insistence on "the right of the
 international communist movement to submit its opinion on the problems
 arising in the socialist countries" and took note of its contention
 that communists in capitalist states have a legitimate interest in
 "democratization and the supersedure of bureaucratic methods" in
 socialist countries.
 Affinity between the Spanish and the Italian CP's was underscored in
 a communique issued last January after talks between the two parties.
 "In accordance with the decisions taken by the two parties on the
 events in Czechoslovakia," the communique stated, both parties
 "reaffirmed that the independence and equality between the socialist
 states, as well as respect for the autonomy and unity of the communist
 parties and nonintervention in their internal affairs" must provide
 the foundation for "the real unity of the communist movement."
 ISSUE OF "SPANISH"     Carrillo's MUNDO OBRERO article condemning the
 ROAD O SOCIALISM       ousted pro-Soviet dissidents affirmed the
 party's commitment to pursuit of its own road
 to socialism, promising that "socialism will take a special form in
 Spain and will have its own peculiarities which are deeply democratic."
 At the same time, he made it clear that Spanish socialism will have
 little in common with that practiced in Eastern Europe and, implicitly,
 in the USSR:
 We know that the Spanish working class cannot wait in Madrid
 for the arrival of the socielist countries' tanks in order to
 take over power.  These tanks will not arrive.  And so much
 the better, for socialism will be more socialist and will know
 how to defend itself better if it is the people . . . who with
 their own intelligence and their own efforts and sacrifices
 achieve victory for socialism, and if this victory is won in a
 democratic process . . . .
 The Spanish CP has reacted to recent efforts by Moscow media to
 denigrate those who favor the notion of "many roads to socialism."
 An article in the 5 April MUNDO OBRERO noted that in connection
 with the invasion of Czechoslovakia "a trend" has appeared "to
 negate the diversity of forms and models which socialism needs if it
 is to be victorious under the many different conditions of today--a
 diversity bound to become even greater when socialism triumphs in
 developed capitalist countries."  The article concluded with a thinly
 veiled admonition to the CPSU:   "To deny the diversity of the communist
 movement means to deepen its divisions.'

 USSR  INTERNAL AFFAIRS
 CONTENTION OVER BREZHNEV ROLE EVIDENT IN NOMINATION REPORTS
 Press treatment of the nominations of Soviet leaders for Supreme
 Soviet candidacies in late April reflects Brezhnev's enhanced
 status in the hierarchy as well as contention over his favorer?,
 position.  TABS accounts of local nomination meetings published
 in PRAVDA and in most other central papers on 25 and 26 April
 set Brezhnev above his colleagues by reporting flattering
 characterizations of him, only faint praise of Kosygin and
 Podgornyy, and nothing about the other leaders.  By contrast, in its own,
 more balanced report,   IZVESTIYA on 25 April characterized Kosygin,
 Podgornyy, Suslov, and Kirilenko along with Brezhnev as important
 leaders.
 T,.SS' initial favored treatment of Brezhnev may have generated
 objections.  On 30 April TASS presented a more balanced account which
 included flattering characterizations of Kosygin and Podgornyy and
 somewhat diluted praise for Brezhnev, whose achievements were
 associated with the Politburo and Central Committee rather than being
 treated as personal accomplishments.
 During the 1966 Supreme Soviet electoral campaign PRAVDA had avoided
 reporting praise for any individual Politburo member--a reticence in
 contrast to PRAVDA's current reports of tributeo to Brezhnev by
 the local figures nominating him:  "All the Soviet people well
 know L.I. Brezhnev as a true Leninist.  In his post of General
 Secretary of the Central Committee he has shown himself an outstanding
 political figure";  Brezhnev is a "brilliant example of serving the
 cause of Lenin and the CPSU" (PRAVDA, 25 April); and "all his life
 and activity is an example of selfless service to the working class
 and the workers of the country" (PRAVDA, 26 April).  The only other
 top leaders praised in the initial TASS accounts were Kosygin (he
 "has trod a long and glorious path") and Podgornyy (his "enormous
 work in the responsible post of Chairman of the Supreme Soviet
 Presidium").
 FIRST ACCOUNT    Reporting a tribute to Brezhnev as "the Leninist type
 IN IZVESTIYA     of leader, a firm Marxist-Leninist who gives all his
 strength, energy, and talent as an organizer to the
 cause of building a communist society in our country," the 25 April
 IZVESTIYA also cited a characterization of Kosygin as "a true Leninist,
 an important political and state figure"; of Podgornyy as "a prominent
 figure of the Leninist Communist Party and Soviet state"; of Suslov

 as "a prominent party and state figure," and of Kirilenko as one who
 "firmly and unwaveringly implements Leninist policy."      In accounts
 published on 24 and 26 April 1966, IZVESTIYA had also presented a
 carefilly gradated picture:  Brezhnev was "a true son of the Communist
 Party, an important international political figure and fighter for peace
 ?         in the whole world"; Kosygin was "a true Leninist, an important
 organizer and political figure who gives all his strength, experience,
 and knowledge to the building of a communist society"; and Podgornyy
 was "an important figure of our party and state."
 IZVESTIYA's account this year confonnad to 'the more complete reports
 in the local Moscow city organ MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA.  All the statements
 of praise reported in the central press were taken from nomination
 meetings in Moscow city.
 30 APRIL      The TASS account of-the electoral campaign published in
 ACCOUNTS      PRAVDA on 30 April, in a marked change from the initial
 ones, contained a flattering characterization of Kosygin
 as "a prominent party and state figure, a skilled organizer who gives
 all his strength to the service of the motherland," and of Podgornyy
 as "an important party and state figure, a skilled, energetic  leader."
 But Suslov continued to be slighted:  rather than quoting the
 nominating speaker's comments about Suslov, this TASS report noted
 only that the speaker had "told of the life and public activity of
 M.A. Suslov . . . .   "
 At the same time, praise of Brezhnev seemed slightly toned down in
 later accounts through the device of associating his accomplishments
 with the collective instead of singling him out personally.  Thus
 MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA, which published numerous statements of praise
 for Brezhnev on 25 and 26 April, carried only one such statement
 on the 30th.  Moreover, while MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA's account of the
 local campaign on 25 April reported a statement that Brezhnev's
 "achievements in creating the material-technical base of communism
 and in defending and rallying the ranks of the international communist
 movement are great," a 30 April TASS account in MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA
 attributed these achievements to the institutions of power as well:
 "During recent years the CPSU has done significant work in raising
 the leading role of the party, resolving economic tasks, and widely
 developing socialist democracy in our country," and "this is
 primarily the achievement of the CPSU Central Committee, the
 Politburo, and Comrade L.I. Brezhnev."  This statement--still a
 considerable boost for Brezhnev--was also carried in PRAVDA,
 IZVESTIYA, and other papers on 30 April.

 PRC  Ii4TERNAL  AFFAIRS
 MAO, LIN MAKE USUAL MAY DAY APPEARANCES, FIRST SINCE OCTOBER
 Pekit.g reports of May Day festivities highlight the PRC's utilization
 of Mao's thought 'to launch China's first artificial satellite.  Mao
 and Lin Piao, making their first public appearances since October at
 a mass Peking rally reported by NCNA on 2 May, listened with the crowd
 to the strain of "The Last Is Red" :..s the satellite passed over.
 A PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial, released by NCNA on 30 April, also
 marked the holiday with self-congratulatory paeans to the PRC's
 achievement.  In 1969 there was no editorial comment for May Day,
 but a joint editorial on 4 May marked the 50th anniversary of the
 May Fourth Movement.  In 1968 a joint RED FLAG-PEOPLE'S DAILY-
 LIBERATION ARMY DAILY editorial was issued on 1 May.
 NCNA's account of the rally reported Mao, "in excellent health and
 high spirits," speaking animatedly to those on the rostrum and
 waving to the cheering masses.  Lin mounted the rostrum with Mao but
 was not described as talking or waving jointly with Mao as he was
 in NCNA's account of last year's celebrations; last year both Mao
 and Lin reportedly "waved" at the crowd and stopped "again and again"
 to talk to guests.  This year's rally report referred only to Mao's
 chatting with those on the platform and waving to the crowd, though
 a 1 May NCNA dispatch described in detail Lin's actions along with
 Mao's at the reception of Sihanouk on the rostrum.
 There were fewer Politburo members at this year's celebrations in
 Peking than in 1969:  only 16 of the 25 full or alternate Politburo
 members--including Mao and Lin--were reported present, compared with
 24 last year.  The NCNA report explained that the list included
 only those Politburo members "now in Peking."  Four of those
 absent--Hsu Shih-yu, Chen Hsi-lien, Chang Chun-chiao, and Li Hsueh-feng,
 all chairmen of provincial or municipal revolutionary committees--
 may yet appear in provincial accounts of local rallies; the chairmen
 of the Hupeh and Kwangsi revolutionary committees and the chairman
 of the Canton Municipal Revolutionary Committee have already been
 reported at such rallies.
 Hsieh Fu-chih's absence is the most difficult to explain, since three
 low-level members of the Peking Municipal Revolutionary Committee,
 of which he is chairman, appeared at the Peking rally and were
 mentioned in the NCNA report.  The three apparently inactive
 Politburo members, Chu Te, Tung Pi-wu, and Liu Po-cheng, as well as
 a  vice chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, Yeh Chien-ying,
 also failed to appear at the Peking rally; none has appeared in public

 since October.  Former Politburo members Chen Yi, Hsu Hsiang-chen,
 and Nieh Jung-chen, listed immediately after the Politburo members
 as vice chairmen of the Military Commission of the Central Committee
 last May Day and again in October, were not mentioned this year.
 Listed immediately after the Politburo this year were several vice
 chairmen of the National People's Congress (NPC) and of the Chinese
 People's Political Consultative Conference, lending credence to
 reports that formal government restructuring may soon culminate in
 an NPC session.  Except at government functions, these vice chairmen
 are usually listed after the Central Committee members.

 CHINESE  SAT EL LITE
 PEKING USES PROXY OF FOREIGN PARTIES TO HAIL PRC PROWESS
 A continuing substantial volume of Peking propaganda on the flight of
 the Chinese satellite launched on 24 April includes prominent play for
 messages of congratulation from friendly parties and groups abroad,
 playing on the familiar themes that the launch was a victory  of Mao's
 thought, an encouragement to revolutionary peoples worldwide, and a blow
 to the trinity of "U.S. imperialism, the Soviet social-imperialists, and
 all reactionaries in the world."
 While still refraining on its own authority from discussing the strategic
 implications of the launch, Peking uses the proxy of foreign well-wishers
 to project a picture of enhanced PRC military prowess.  Thus NCNA on
 4 May carried the text of a message from the Spanish Communist Party
 (Marxist-Leninist) which observes that "this new progress made by
 People's China In space science and technology has strQngthened the
 defense capabilities of your great country to opp.,   the policy of
 constant threats and provocations by the U.S. impe.   lists and Soviet
 social-imperialists."  A 1 May NCNA roundup of foreign reaction quotes
 a Japanese peasant to the effect that the weight and quality of the PRC's
 first satellite "surpass by far" those of the first Soviet and U.S.
 vehicles and that the launching "greatly increases the world people's
 strength for opposing aggressive wars."
 The only high-level PRC comment publicized since the launch announcements
 is in speeches delivered by Chou En-lai on 25 and 26 April at banquets
 for delegations attending the summit conference of the Indochinese
 peoples.  On the 25th, according to NCNA on 2 May, Chou called the
 space satellite a "gift" to the conferees, a victory of the Chinese
 people, "and also a victory for all of us."  According to the 3 May
 report of the se.:ond banquet, Chou said that the launch "is progress,
 yet it is not sufficient, and we must continue to exert ourselves.  We
 believe that the Chinese people will certainly catch up with and surpass
 the world's most advanced level in industry, science, and technology."
 EAST EUROPEAN MEDIA VIEW CHINESE LAUNCHING WITH CONCERN
 While Moscow is silent on the Chinese satellite, having reported the
 launching briefly on 25 April, various East European media have commented
 * To date Peking has devoted no central press comment or radio commentary
 tc the launch.  Three of the Chinese nuclear tests occasioned central
 press comment--the first 3 n October 1964, the test of the nuclear missile
 in October 1966, and the hydrogen-bomb detonation in June 1967.

 critically on Chinese motives and expressed concern about the
 implications of the launching. Thus an article in the Bratislava
 PRAVDA on 28 April speculates on the possible effect it may have on
 disarmament efforts.  The report of the launch, the paper says,
 "was recorded in Vienna with particular attention" even though this
 first step by the Chinese represents more of a symbol than evidence
 of a capability to catch up with the USSR and the United States.
 It is a fact, the commentary adds, that at a time when Washington
 and Moscow are engaged in efforts to limit strategic arms, those
 weapons "are sought after by a state which so far has refused to
 conform with or submit in any way to the past results of the
 efforts for world disarmament" and which pursues domestic and
 foreign policies marked by "adventurous extravagance."  The article
 remarks that the PRC achievement has not drawn the kind of response
 earlier launchings by other states have received because "modern
 weapons are falling into the hands of those who so far have refused
 to respect the realities of the world--into the hands of those whose
 past propaganda and views concerning atomic weapons arouse no good
 feeling at all."
 Budapest's MTI on the 29th reviews an article in that day's MAGYAR
 NEMZET which points out that the launch demonstrates a Chinese
 capability to produce long-range missiles.  The article says it is
 not possible "to assess realistically any series of events in the
 Far East and Southeast Asia, and this applies even to problems beyond
 the regional borders" such as disarmament, without taking Chinese
 political aspirations into consideration.
 Warsaw's domestic service on 2 May remarks on the propagandistic aspects
 of the satellite launch, commenting that the Chinese have chosen to
 orbit a satellite which broadcasts a song about Mao "instead of
 transmitting to earth data that could augment the knowledge of
 scientists about space."  Declaring that China is "still far away
 from a leading position in the field of rocket technology," the
 commentary says the PRC is at the same stage of development as the
 USSR in  1957 and the United States in 1958.  It goes on to note
 that the "Western press" recently carried reports about "interesting
 transactions" between Peking and Bonn resulting in the PRC's purchase
 of a subsi,antial volume of arms and products for the arms industry, and
 it quotes the Soviet news agency NOVOSTI as having said that "only
 thanks to Bonn's assistance were the Maoists able to increase their
 rocket technology."  The commentary does not indicate when NOVOSTI
 made this allegation; an IZVESTIYA item following the October 1966
 Chinese nuclear-missile test had reported a West German press article
 on a contract. allegedly signed by a West German missile expert for
 the construction of a rocket base in the PRC capable of launching
 missiles with a range of 650 kilometers.

 ROMANIA ASSERTS INDEPENDENT STANCE WITH FAVORABLE COMMENT
 Consistent with Premier Maurer's congratulatory message to Chou En-lai,
 Romania asserts its independent posture and its policy of good relations
 with "all" socialist countries by carrying cordial comment on the
 Chinese feat in the party organ SCINTEIA. A 30 April article in the
 paper, reviewed by AGERPRES, says the satellite launch "has been
 received with great satisfaction by public opinion in Romania" and
 calls it important both scientifically and from the point of view of
 international political life.  The achievement, the article says, is
 "a contribution to the assertion of the superiority of socialism, to
 the strengthening of the world socialist system, the might of which
 increases following the development, flourishing, and strengthening
 of each socialist country and nation."
