 The Congress and the Provinces
 F_               I
 The pattern of provincial representation at
 the 4th National People's Congress does not augur
 well for two embattled first secretaries fighting
 to retain their posts.  All provincial party bosses
 and military region commanders were present and
 elected to the congress' presidium with the ex-
 ception of Wang Chia-tao of Heilungkiang and Hsieh
 Chen-hua of Shansi.
 Reasons for Wang's apparent decline are not
 hard to find.   He is a military man whose past links
 to Lin Piao and the radicals in the leadership have
 landed him in hot water before.   Suspected of com-
 plicity in the Lin plot, Wang was out of sight for
 nearly two years following that crisis in September
 1971, but in June 1973 he was returned to his post
 as first secretary of Heilungkiang.   He came under
 attack again during the anti-Confucius campaign and
 turned up in Peking on National Day, suggesting that
 his case had been reopened.   The election of the
 number-two man in Heilungkiang, fellow military
 officer Liu Kuang-tao, to the presidium also seems
 to indicate that Wang has been purged.
 Hsieh Chen-hua's most recent troubles began
 last spring with the attacks on "Three Visits to
 Taofeng," an opera originally produced in Shansi.
 Leftists branded the opera a "poisonous weed," ap-
 parently because they considered it a veiled at-
 tack on Chiang Ching.   Wall posters criticizing
 Hsieh and his alleged support of the opera soon
 flourished, and by National Day he too was in Peking,
 presumably answering for his conduct.   Hsieh's case
 probably was not helped by the fact that he, like
 Wang, is a soldier once suspected of overly close
 ties with Lin Piao.

 The congress offered no clue as to who might
 fill outstanding provincial vacancies.  Three
 rehabilitated provincial bosses who have been ap-
 pearing in Peking--all likely candidates for a top
 provincial job--were given other posts.   The num-
 ber-one spot is open in Liaoning, Anhwei, and
 Hupeh, and if suspicions about Wang and Hsieh prove
 correct, there are vacancies in Heilungkiang and
 Shansi as well.
 25X1
 The moderate tone of the congress--and Chou's
 report in particular--was undoubtedly well received
 by the vast majority of provincial cadre.   Veteran
 officials will certainly approve of the stress on
 stricter discipline, greater economic expertise,
 and a reduced political role for the military.   Many
 of these officials have been criticized in the past
 for holding similar views.
 Workers, youth, and factory managers may find
 less to cheer about.   The congress did not mention
 the possibility of higher wages or further reform
 of the down-to-the-countryside program--two demands
 that have led to demonstrations in some cities.
 Factory managers may find Chang Chun-chiao's refer-
 ence to "unhealthy tendencies" in some enterprises
 unnerving, but his remarks seem to be aimed more at
 general bureaucratic abuses than at specific in-
 dividuals.   In any case, there may be some movement
 on these thorn  issues, now that the congress is
 over. F7                   I

 Ministry Mathematics
 The list of government ministries and commis-
 sions that emerged from the National People's Con-
 gress shows some additions, some subtractions,  some
 divisions, and some consolidations.
 A number of ministries that never publicly re-
 surfaced after the Cultural Revolution were offi-
 cially dropped, in line with Peking's desire to
 streamline the government apparatus.  Their functions
 have undoubtedly been taken on by other ministries--the
 work of the defunct internal affairs ministry, for
 example, has probably been assumed by the Public Se-
 curity Ministry.
 Some organizations that did re-emerge after the
 Cultural Revolution were also dropped.   Most note-
 worthy among these were the two commissions dealing
 with the sensitive areas of science and technology.
 Work in these areas has certainly not been abandoned.
 Some of it may now be carried out in other organi
 zations, such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
 and it is possible that a secret unit exists to
 conduct this sensitive work.  There is currently
 no publicly identified government ministry that
 even includes the word science in its title, sug-
 gesting that the Chinese are especially anxious to
 keep this area out of the public eye.   One Peking
 news release referred to ministries, commissions,
 and unspecified scientific research units "under
 the central government."
 Two ministries--culture and education--that
 -were in limbo since the Cultural Revolution were
 reconstituted at the congress.   Until that time,
 supervision of these areas was in the hands of
 special "groups" under the State Council.   The
 status of these groups is still in doubt.   They
 may still exist to oversee the work of the two new

 ministries, but no mention of the groups has been
 made since the congress.   Culture and education
 have been particularly vulnerable to leftist influ-
 ence, and re-establishing the ministries may be an
 effort to give political moderates a greater say
 in these areas.   The new minister of culture is a
 leftist, but it is conceivable that some of the vice
 ministers--:none has yet been identified--may be
 moderates.
 The new minister of education has held a num-
 ber of important positions in the government and has
 experience in the field of education.   He is clearly
 a moderate, and his appointment reflects the dissatis-
 faction of moderates in the leadership with the
 leftist-inspired controversy over educational stand-
 ards that erupted in the summer of 1973.   This con-
 troversy has continued, in more muted tones, ever
 since.   Significantly, the new education minister
 was the first of the new ministers to appear pub-
 licly with Chou En-lai, thus signaling Chou's ap-
 proval of the new appointee and his endorsement of
 a moderate line on education that emphasizes aca-
 demic rather than political achievement.   The Min-
 istry of Education, which was in charge of only -
 primary and secondary education before the Cultural
 Revolution, has apparently absorbed the functions
 of the former ministry of higher education, which
 used to handle university and post-graduate work.
 Two ministries that existed before the Cultural
 Revolution but were merged with other ministries
 afterwards were set up again as separate entities.
 Both of these areas--coal and railways--suffered
 economic disruptions over the past year due in part
 to political disturbances caused by the anti-Con-
 fucius campaign.   Workers took advantage of the un-
 certain political atmosphere to agitate for higher
 wages by slowing down production and staying away
 from work.   This attitude was especially prevalent
 in the coal industry.   Peking's concern with trans-
 portation problems was forcefully demonstrated late

 made widely publicized visits to the railroads.
 Recreating separate coal and railway ministries is
 an obvious effort to improve economic performance
 in these troubled areas.

 Peking Still Wary  on Vietnam
 I                               I
 Peking's cautious treatment of developments in
 Indochina was pointed up last week when its highest:
 level comment on the second anniversary of the Paris
 cease-fire was an NCNA correspondent's low-key re-
 port on the situation in Vietnam. Last year, the
 anniversary prompted a People's Daily editorial
 specifically commemorating the agreement.
 Themes in the NCNA account this year are typical
 of Chinese commentary on the Vietnam situation over
 the past year or so.   The Paris agreement is charac-
 terized as the result of many years of "valiant fight-
 ing" and "great victories" on the part of the South
 Vietnamese people. The report asserts that Hanoi has
 strictly respected the cease-fire, but that Saigon
 has repeatedly violated it.
 While Hanoi's propaganda assailed with nearly
 equal violence the alleged US and South Vietnamese
 cease-fire violations, the Chinese concentrated
 their attacks on the "Thieu clique." They stopped
 short, however, of directly calling for Thieu'  over-
 throw before the Paris accords can be implemented--
 the central theme of recent North Vietnamese propa-
 ganda.
 In comparison with Hanoi's treatment, Peking's
 criticism of the US role in Vietnam was limited.
 The only specific criticism directed against the
 US accuses the Americans of "illegally" maintaining
 military personnel in South Vietnam and of supplying
 military equipment to Saigon.

 Views on Soviet Succession
 F7
 Unlike Soviet diplomats and officials who seem
 willing to speculate endlessly about the succession
 possibilities in Peking,  the Chinese are reticent--
 and try to appear uninterested--in Soviet succession
 politics.   Nonetheless, as the state of Brezhnev's
 health and recent Soviet setbacks in the Middle East
 and in trade relations with the US have heightened
 speculation regarding Brezhnev's position, brief
 comments have come from knowledgeable Chinese on
 Soviet succession to shed some light. on Peking's
 views.
 Teng Hsiao-ping indicated, in
 effect, that the Chinese believe succession in Mos-
 cow will have little bearing on Soviet policy.   Teng
 contended that personalities in the Soviet leader-
 ship are of little account and that there are im-
 peratives common to all Soviet regimes, extending
 back to tsarist times, that determine Soviet policy.
 Teng reportedly added that Soviet-policy is made by
 a leadership team rather than by a single individual,
 and that there are no hawks or doves in Moscow.
 Teng's statements accord with the impression of
 Soviet leaders that Chinese propaganda has long tried
 to convey--that Moscow's leaders are a homogeneous
 collective whose "expansionist" policies abroad and
 "oppression" at home are directly descendant from
 those of the Russian tsars.   More fundamentally,
 however, Teng's remarks almost certainly reflect a
 basically pessimistic Chinese view of the prospects
 of an amelioration of Sino-Soviet tensions that goes
 far beyond propaganda rhetoric.
 The Chinese do.occasionally show some interes?t
 in the personalities involved in  the Soviet succession

 I                                                           Politburo
 member Andrey Kirilenko is likely to neT transi-

 IKirilenko would be  o -
 owe  by Politburo member  edor Kulakov or possibly
 KGB head Yuri Andropov.   This is a fairly standard
 assessment, shared at least in part by many Commu-
 nist and Western observers.                       volun-
 teered no amplification, however, passing up an op-
 portunity to assess each of these figures in terms
 of Chinese interests.   This probably reflects Teng's
 line that a change of personalities would have little
 effect on Soviet policy.
 This view certainly is dominant within the cur-
 rent generation of leadership in Peking, whose dis-
 trust and hostility toward Moscow in large part con-
 trols Chinese foreign policy.  This does not mean
 that Peking is not deeply interested in political
 trends in Moscow.   Even though Peking has not yet
 exhibited the high degree of interest in Soviet suc-
 cession that the Chinese did in developments in the
 US around the time of the change of power in Wash-
 ington, Peking almost certainly keeps close tabs
 on the situation in Moscow, as it does regarding
 developments in Washington and Tokyo.
 The Chinese doubtless remain mindful of the
 period shortly after Brezhnev succeeded Khrushchev
 in late 1964 when both sides briefly explored the
 possibilities of an easier Sino-Soviet relationship.
 Peking quickly concluded that nothing had changed
 in Moscow but the man at the top, and this experience
 is likely to color the Chinese approach to any new
 exploration of an easing of   ensions when and if

 Always a Bridesmaid
 While Peking's leftists were clearly the
 losers at the recent National People's Congress,
 Vice Premier Li Hsien-nien,  perhaps Chou En-lai's
 closest associate on the Politburo, suffered a set-
 back of his own.   Although minor compared with the
 treatment the leftists had to endure, it was un-
 doubtedly disappointing to Li in light of his long
 and loyal service to Chou.
 Li had been waiting in the wings since the
 Cultural Revolution, when he was virtually the only
 reliable helping hand Chou En-lai had to keep the
 machinery of government running during some very
 tumultuous years.   For several years, Li was the
 only vice premier.   Joined a few years ago by some
 aging and largely symbolic vice premiers, Li was
 by default the ranking deputy premier and seemed
 to have a solid claim to the premiership after
 Chou's death.   The emergence last spring of Teng
 Hsiao-ping as a major government figure in his own
 right was softened somewhat by what appeared to
 be a deliberate effort to divide the workload
 relatively evenly between Li and Tenq.   Although
 Teng seemed to have the inside track for eventual
 succession to the job of premier, Li continued to
 outrank him in the party.
 The second central committee plenum held
 early in January resolved the issue of party rank
 in Teng's favor.   As a party vice chairman, he
 clearly outranks Li.   The People's Congress set-
 tled the vice premier issue, with Teng designated
 as ranking deputy.   These moves probably came as

 case was undoubtedly his designation as third,
 rather than second, deputy premier.   Among the
 vice premiers, Li is now outranked not only by
 Teng but by Chang Chun-chiao.
 Chang, in his early 60s and therefore rela-
 tively young as Chinese leaders go, is several
 years younger than either Teng or Li.  Chang's
 appointment as second deputy premier was probably
 motivated by longer range succession plans.  Teng
 and Li are at best interim successors, but the
 increasingly powerful Chang seems likely to be an
 important figure for many years to come.
 At the congress, Li also lost the finance
 portfolio.  He was the minister of finance before
 the Cultural Revolution and apparently continued
 to function in that capacity as late as 1970.  Al-
 though Li was last publicly identified in that posi-

 What's Next for the Military?

 Recent personnel appointments and constitutional
 revisions have clearly reflected a significant re-
 duction in the political power of the military.                                                The
 top military and government jobs are now controlled
 by the coalition of moderate forces championed by
 Premier Chou En-lai.   The moderates have the upper
 hand in Peking and they appear to be committed to
 further strengthening party authority over the armed
 forces.   Chou and his aging allies, however, will have
 to remain in good health to maintain the current
 momentum.
 25X1
 The chairman of the Chinese Communist Party
 now commands the army, which specifically includes
 the militia.   Under the previous government con-
 stitution, command was in the hands of the state
 chairman, a post that has been abolished.,   The Na-
 tional People's Congress also approved a government
 leadership slate dominated by civilians, and bounced
 three ministers that had been military men.
 Mao has been a strong supporter of" efforts to
 undercut the military and almost certainly remains
 so.   His decision to absent himself from Peking last
 summer, in fact, appears to have been heavily in-
 fluenced by his feeling that the moderates were not.

 being tough enough on the military.  He was prob-
 ably particularly upset by the central directive
 issued in early duly 1974, which re-oriented the
 campaign to criticize Lin and Confucius from strug-
 gle against individuals--primarily military leaders--
 toward economic goals together with study and
 criticism on a theoretical level.
 The moderates had a number of valid reasons
 for winding down the campaign, and in effect saving
 the necks of a number of military men who had become
 its major targets.   Economic production and social
 order had been adversely affected, and the age and
 uncertain health of key moderate leaders such as
 Chou made it imperative to press ahead with efforts
 to hammer out a new government structure and leader-
 ship line-up.   Now, a new government hierarchy and
 constitution have been ratified, and efforts are
 under way to shore up the economy and increase law
 and order.  A resumption of pressure on the mili-
 tary--especially in light of Mao's apparent posi-
 tion on the issue--iis entirely possible.
 The task, if taken up, will not be easy.   Fac-
 tionalism remains serious in several provinces, and
 control over the troops in the field still counts.
 Provincial military men have, in some cases, been able
 to deflect or mitigate much of the effect of earlier
 efforts to circumscribe their political authority.
 Their positions have been steadily weakened, how-
 ever, and they certainly are on the defensive.   With
 nearly all known posts at the center filled, and the
 government structure put back in order, those elements
 at the center most intent on bringing the military
 into line can focus their attention more directly on
 problems in the provinces
 The thrust of domestic propaganda and the pat-
 tern of personnel appointments provide some clues
 as to how these elements might go about downgrad-
 ing the military?   Domestic media are stressing the

 need to strengthen civilian party authority, a theme
 that has been repeatedly echoed in the provinces.
 It is quite possible that more civilian veterans
 will be named to vacant provincial party posts or
 as replacements for military men.   The propaganda
 will also tend to embolden local party committees
 25X1
 in their dealings with their counterpart militar
 party committees.
 Having said all this, it is by no means certain
 that a number of military men will be purged.   A
 showdown between the dominant forces in Peking and
 the military could occur, but Chinese military men
 can presumably calculate the balance of political
 power and the direction of policy at least as well
 as Western China-watchers, so that soldiers in
 political positions may be inclined to compromise.
 Thus, if firm pressure is brought to bear on sol-
 dier-politicians, they might give up their party and
 government posts, particularly in the provinces, in
 order to retain their military responsibilities.

 China Builds More Roads in 1974
 Peking has announced that it completed nine
 trunk highways plus 10,000 kilometers of simple
 roads last year.  Highways totaling more than 13,000
 kilometers--still less than 2 percent of the total
 road network--were surfaced with asphalt or residual
 oil during the year.  Peking claims that this new
 road construction permitted the volume of freight
 and passenger traffic to exceed that of 19730

 About 30,000 kilometers of roads have been added
 annually to the Chinese network--which now exceeds
 725,000 kilometers--since 1970.  Three fourths of
 the network consists of simple roads of dirt or gravel
 linking communes and production brigades to markets
 and sources of industrial goods.                                      25X1

 ANNEX:   Mao's Position--An Assessment
 In a letter to his wile, w ich was re-
 quired reading during the anti-Confucius
 campaign, Mao Tse-tung remarks that his
 is a compound personality, accom-
 modating both the bold. and aggressive
 spirit of the tiger and the sly and adapt-
 able spirit of the monkey. Right now, the
 spirit,of the monkey predominates.
 Mao has not been "placed on the shelf
 like an old Buddha," as he described his
 situation in the early 1960s, but he has
 only a limited time to achieve his current
 political aims.
 The absence of Mao Tse-tung at the
 recently concluded National People's
 Congress in Peking has struck nearly all
 observers, Chinese and foreign. This
 gesture. may ultimately turn out to have
 political implications as important as any
 development at the congress itself.
 Some observers attribute Mao's
 absence to health problems; others note
 that he was involved in preliminary plan-
 ning for the meeting and say he was not
 .strictly speaking required to attend a
 governmentai function; still others
 suggest that Mao had been angered by the
 short shrift given to policies and per-
 sonalities identified with the extreme left.
 There are serious problems with these
 interpretations. There is no evidence that
 the Chairman is especially troubled by
 health problems. He has been seeing a
 stream of foreign visitors in >?eGent weeks
 and months
 The published material connected with
 the congress does not depict a Mao who is
 merely an impotent figurehead, although
 it is not inconsistent with such an inter-
 pretation-or with the portrait of a
 politically active chairman.
 None of this means that Mao could
 easily afford to absent himself from the
 people's congress. The symbolic nature of
 the act has not been lost on the average
 Chinese, on Chinese officials, who already
 are busy trying to explain it away, on the
 Chairman himself, ? or on other major
 Chinese leaders.
 Even if Mao in theory did not need to
 attend the congress, he was, as chairman
 of the party, required to attend the Cen-
 tral Committee plenum that preceded it.
 He did not simply miss these two im-
 portant meetings; he has been out of Pek-
 ing for nearly seven months. This
 prolonged absence is itself a political act
 and makes it very difficult not to conclude
 that strains have developed between Mao
 and some of the other Chinese leaders.
 Chinese policy has ggnerally been made
 by consensus, with the Chairman the most
 important-but by no means the
 only-element in its formation. Official
 Chinese party history indicates that he has
 not always had his way; when this has
 happened, he has sometimes chosen to
 precipitate a major showdown and
 sometimes chosen to retreat for the mo-
 ment.
 His recent stay in the provinces
 suggests that he has been attempting to
 build a new consensus. His absence from
 the recent meetings in Peking indicates
 that on at least one issue of importance to
 him he has failed and has consequently
 disassociated himself from the "majority"
 decision.
 What was the issue that caused Mao to
 sulk in his tent? It is likely to have been
 whether it was advisable-or possible-to
 purge important military figures with
 whom Mao has been at odds for several
 years.
 The evidence does not suggest the
 Chairman has been arguing for the ap-
 pointment to important positions of in-
 dividuals closely associated with the ex-
 treme left in Chinese politics or for
 greater radical experimentation in
 Chinese policy.
 He was deeply involved in the return of
 Teng Hsiao-ping, a bete noire of the ex-
 treme radicals, a year ago; Teng, in fact,
 was elevated to the Politburo at the per-
 sonal nomination of the Chairman, who
 remarked at the time that Teng would
 make "a good chief of staff."
 Mao was evidently also involved in the
 rehabilitation of other victims of the
 cultural revolution, a process that con-
 tinued without significant pause through
 1974. If these rehabilitations, pleasing to
 the pragmatists and displeasing to the ex-
 treme left, were made over Mao's objec-
 tions, it is hard to see why he waited until
 the summer of 1974 to disassociate
 himself by moving to the provinces.
 The propaganda associated with the
 anti-Confucius campaign does not seem
 to link Mao with a new turn to the "left."
 Its main line, couched in historical anal-
 ogy, has consistently been that China must
 modernize, that centralization and dis-
 cipline are essential to this task, that
 foreign expertise is an important adjunct
 to this process, and that the. process itself
 is made doubly important by a threat
 from China's northern neighbor, a threat
 which can be partly balanced by a
 program of "making friends with distant
 states."
 These programs are attributed to a
 far-seeing Prime Minister, who had the
 full backing of the "Emperor"-i.e., Mao
 himself. The two are said to have been op-
 posed by "Confucians" concerned with

 abstract and empty rites and by "feudal
 princes."
 It is hard to escape the conclusion that
 these oppositionists are "leftist"
 ideologues and provincial military com-
 manders, respectively. In fact, the shape
 and ultimate outcome of the National
 People's Congress was foreshadowed by
 propaganda as early as the autumn of
 1973.
 There are indications that a number of
 authoritative articles connected with the
 anti-Confucius campaign were written or
 immediately inspired by Mao himself. In
 any case, no counter-argument surfaced
 to claim that the "Emperor" did not real-
 ly support the Prime Minister.
 Even last winter and spring when
 scattered leftist counter-attacks against
 conservative policies and perhaps against
 Chou personally were appearing, leftist
 broadsides frequently seemed to be saying
 that Mao should support the position of
 the ideologues-the clear implication be-
 ing that he did not.
 All this almost certainly does not mean
 that Mao has abandoned the ideas he
 pushed in the 1960s. Rather, his priorities
 seem to have shifted. For one thing, his
 obsession with the Soviet threat has
 grown over the years, and he seems to
 believe that China must modernize and
 expand its economy more rapidly if it is to
 face the long-term challenge from the
 north successfully.
 Mao appears to see two main obstacles
 to success:
 ? Ideological  carping  over  the
 programs necessary for modernization
 threaten the programs themselves and
 give rise to differences among Chinese
 leaders that can in time be exploited by
 Moscow.
 ? The political power acquired by
 regional and provincial military figures
 during the cultural revolution could
 threaten centralized direction of the
 Mao receives Maltese Prime Minister Mintoff on January 9
 program; the Lin Piao affair of 1971
 highlighted the danger of indiscipline
 within the armed forces and raised the
 spectre of a military coup against the cen-
 tral civilian authorities.
 Of the two problems, that posed by the
 military almost certainly presents the
 greater danger in Mao's eyes. Anti-Con-
 fucius propaganda fulminated with par-
 ticular harshness against regional and
 provincial military commanders. These
 soldiers were said to want either less
 acrimony  in  China's  relations with
 Moscow or a greater share of the budget
 and a more rapid development of China's
 advanced weapons program.
 The first of these alternatives would un-
 dermine the rationale of China's foreign
 policy; the second would distort the effort
 to modernize the Chinese economy. The
 argument on these fundamental issues
 was dangerously complicated by the fact
 the military controlled guns and troops.
 It was against this background that
 Mao suddenly departed for the -provinces
 last summer. A number or Other events
 coincided with his departure.
 ? Chou En-lai was compelled to
 enter the hospital, clearly quite ill.
 ? The  anti-Confucius  campaign
 began to run out of steam, and a new

 for unity within the party was in-
 troduced.
 ? The first slight cracks appeared in
 the picture of a united "Emperor" and
 Prime Minister: the merits of the
 Prime Minister were still stressed, but
 it was noted that he was too willing to
 compromise with his opponents.
 These opponents were almost certainly
 military men, since the "unity" theme did
 nothing to improve the weakened position
 of the extreme left. At the same time, the
 budgetary and strategic arguments
 against the soldiers were spelled out in
 greater detail, and. the invective against
 them increased in harshness.
 It is entirely possible that Chou's
 hospitalization created a new political
 situation in Peking. With Chou unable to
 supervise the myriad details of a volatile
 and politically charged campaign, many
 of the Premier's supporters and perhaps
 Chou himself may well have concluded
 that a frontal assault against the en-
 trenched military was simply too
 dangerous. They could not afford a repeti-
 tion of the Lin affair.
 Such a conclusion would not necessari-
 ly mean that the military's budgetary and
 strategic arguments were to be accepted
 or that the military's role in politics was
 not to be curbed; it would mean that the
 effort to circumscribe powerful military
 figures would stop short of drastic per-
 sonal action against them.
 There were some signs that the military
 felt themselves to be in a stronger position
 in the autumn of 1974. Several important
 regional military commanders who had
 been under heavy attack in the spring and
 had long been out of sight reappeared in
 early autumn. Rumors that the military
 were making a comeback swept China in
 the late autumn.
 One story, which gained wide currency,
 claimed that Mao had called a meeting in
 Wuhan of the 13 regional military com-
 manders and that all but two managed to
 stay away. If not exact in detail, the story
 probably contains more than a grain of
 truth.
 It seems to have been shortly after this
 rumored affront that Mao issued his dic-
 tum that eight years of cultural revolution
 were enough and that army and party must
 unite.
 This pronouncement may well have
 been a tactical retreat on the Chairman's
 part, for signs continued to crop up that
 he himself was not ready to "unite" with
 the military. The November issue of Red
 Flag carried another of the authoritative
 articles associated with the Chairman,
 making a case against the military com-
 manders in especially vehement terms.
 It spoke of "feudal princes" and a
 "dowager empress" who collaborated
 with them-an apparent reference to
 Chiang Ching, the Chairman's leftist
 wife-and called them traitors for their
 willingness to give up claims to territory
 along China's northern border. The
 charge of traitor strongly suggested that a
 case for a purge was being made. The
 Prime Minister was once again accused of
 weakness and willingness to compromise.
 A response to this tirade appeared in
 the Hong Kong communist newspaper Ta
 Kung Pao
 The response praised a far-sighted
 Prime Minister, loyal to the "Emperor,"
 not only for his ability to "control the em-
 press' family" but also for his ability to
 unite opposing factions-specifically, the
 bureaucrats and the military. It painted
 the portrait of another, rash "Emperor"
 who persisted in his plans for battle,
 despite advice to the contrary from ex-
 perienced ministers. It went on to note
 that the battle proved a disaster for the
 "Emperor."
 Thus, on the eve of the plenum and the
 congress, the positions were clearly
 drawn.
 ? A consensus group, including Chou
 En-lai, seemed prepared to push forward
 with the meetings, which would codify the
 policies of the early 1970s and make
 relatively conservative personnel ap-
 pointments, without first risking a frontal
 assault against entrenched military com-
 manders.
 ? The Chairman, on the other hand,
 seemed prepared to run those risks and
 was apparently demanding a purge of
 leading military personalities.  His
 deliberate identification with the
 pragmatic policies of the past four years
 indicates that he was not pushing for a
 new turn to the left in the style of the
 mid-1960s; his quarrel with the Premier
 appeared to be carefully circumscribed
 and seemed to rest entirely on the narrow
 ground that Chou and the consensus
 group were unwilling to take extreme
 measures against a potentially disruptive
 military.
 Both the extreme left and the military
 suffered a considerable defeat at the
 plenum and congress, but the former may
 have been hurt more than the latter.
 Chou's enunciation of economic
 priorities-agriculture first, light industry
 second, heavy industry third-indicates
 that the military had lost the budgetary
 battle, but his brief and circumspect treat-
 ment of the problem of civilian-military
 relations strongly suggests that this issue
 had not been settled to anyone's satisfac-
 tion.
 In short, the role of the military
 remains a contentious-perhaps the most
 contentious-issue in Chinese politics.
 If it is, Mao probably still has con-
 siderable room for maneuver. He appears

 to remain concerned that compromise
 with the military establishment threatens
 his policy of political confrontation with
 Moscow, and he may see opportunity for
 renewed pressure against the soldiers.
 The expulsion  of several Soviet
 diplomats from China for espionage ac-
 tivities a year ago raised the possibility
 that the Soviet "spies" would be linked to
 high-level figures in the Chinese regime.
 Despite the turmoil of the anti-Confucius
 campaign, this shoe was never dropped;
 nor have the three members of the Soviet
 helicopter crew captured last winter ever
 been brought to public trial.
 Relations with Moscow certainly have
 not been improved as a result of the
 decisions taken at the congress, but a
 move on either of these fronts could easily
 worsen  relations.  This  could  be a
 further bone of contention, perhaps pit-
 ting the Chairman against the military es-
 tablishment.
 If, however, the consensus against an
 all-out assault on the soldiers holds and if
 Mao continues to press for further action
 against them, the lines of cleavage within
 the Chinese leadership could become
 much sharper and deeper than they now
 appear to be, perhaps creating a situation
 analogous to that in the early and
 mid-1960s.
 In such circumstances the Chairman
 may simply wait for a political opening he
 can turn to his advantage. He is, however,
 15 years older, and time is surely not on
 his side. On the other hand, he seems to
 agree with the consensus group on a wide
 range of issues, and he apparently ho es
 to avoid an open split with them.
