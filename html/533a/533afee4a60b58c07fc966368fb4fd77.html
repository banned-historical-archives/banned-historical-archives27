FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
INDIA-PAKISTAN 
Both Indian and Pakistani radio broadcasts are 
reporting continued fighting along the borders of 
East Pakistan in Jessore and Sylhet districts. Their 
claims are contradictory, however, and the degree of 
Indian Army participation remains unclear. The Pak-
istanis say that Indian troops are spearheading the 
drives and have launched?a new offensive into Comilla 
District. The Indians insist that the Mukti Bahini 
alone are conducting the campaigns and are scoring 
new successes in Rangpur and Khulna districts. In-
dian leaders are still denying adamantly that Indian 
troops have crossed the border. 
In a meeting with Ambassador Farland yesterday, 
President Yahya Khan, while "visibly tense," indi-
cated that he was not yet prepared to take the bor-
der issue before the UN Security Council and would 
not do so, in any event, for the next several days. 
Yahya seems to be still casting about for 
a way out of his dilemma in East Pakistan. 
He has summoned both the Bengali governor 
of the East and leading West Pakistani poi-
itieian Z. A. Bhutto for talks allegedly 
intended to speed up the formation of a 
civilian government. It is unlikely, how-
ever, that the guerrillas will settle for 
any 11th-hour solution short of immediate, 
full independence.

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
USSR 
The party central committee, in its two-day session 
in Moscow, made minimal changes in the composition 
of the top ruling bodies. Mikhail SoZomentsev, who 
replaced Gennady Voronov as premier of the Russian 
Republic last July, was elevated to candidate mem-
bership in the politburo and was, at the same time, 
released from his former job on the party secretar-
iat. Voronov, however, was not removed from the 
politburo despite the fact that he now holds an in-
significant post which does not warrant representa-
tion on the top policy-making body. 
Voronov may owe his present reprieve at least partly 
to the efforts of his politburo colleagues to keep 
Brezhnev from completely dominating the decision-
making process. Over the years, Brezhnev has been 
able to put his own supporters into the politburo 
and secretariat and to maneuver critics, such as 
Voronov and AZeksandr SheZepin, into positions of 
little power. Matters have stopped there, however, 
and no one has been removed from the politburo since 
Brezhnev became party chief in 1964. 
The central committee approved the five-year plan, 
accepted last month by the politburo, and discussed 
a report by Brezhnev on recent conduct of foreign 
policy, but the terse announcements gave no details 
of either of these plenum activities. Some indica-
tion of the thrust of Brezhnev 's remarks may be re-
flected in the Supreme Soviet session which opens 
today. The main business of the session will be 
the adoption of the five-year plan and next year's 
plan and budget.

USSR 
The latest satellite photography shows no addi-
tional new-type missile silos or test corings at 
ICBM complexes. The current total of new-type silos 
at SS-9 installations remains 25--five each at five 
complexes. There are still six groups, each with 
11 new-type silos, under construction at Derazhnya 
and Pervomaysk where SS-11s are deployed (along with 
a few MRBMs and IRBMs). However, what appear to be 
extra large silo liner segments, seen earlier near 
one of the silos at Derazhnya, are now seen at one 
silo in each group of the new-type silos at both 
Derazhnya and Pervomaysk. In addition, extra large 
segments have been seen near three silos at the SS-9 
complexes--two at one complex and one at another. 
No new groups of ICBM silos are known to 
have been started since March 1971. The 
last silos filling out the groups begun 
earlier were started in July 1971.

COMMUNIST CHINA 
Recent photography of the Hsiao-ping-tao naval 
base in northeast China shows that new missile tubes 
have been installed in China's G-class ballistic mis-
sile submarine. 
China assembled its only G-class submarine 
between 1962 and 1964 from components sup-
plied by the USSR. No missiles for the 
submarine have ever been observed and the 
original missile tubes--presumably designed 
for Soviet missiles--were removed between 
late 1968 and early 1969. Observation of 
the G-class early this year suggested that 
additional modifications were under way. 
The installation of new missile tubes in-
dicates that Peking is seeking to develop 
a submarine launched ballistic missile sys-
tem, and suggests that the 0-class sub-
marine is intended to serve as a test plat-
form for such a missile.

NOTE 
Indochina: The Communists have begun their an-
nual logistics push in the Laotian panhandle1 
of truck traffic doubled in the pas 
week, reaching the highest level since the end of 
the last dry season. Most of the traffic currently 
is concentrated from the passes where the roads enter 
from North Vietnam southto Tchepone. With the pan-
handle roadnet?generally in excellent condition, and 
with good weather continuing, we should expect to 
see truck activity increase and spread southward 
during the coming weeks. Last year the logistics 
"offensive" also began about this time.

COMMUNIST INTENTIONS IN INDOCHINA 
(WINTER 1971-1972) 
The beginning of the dry season finds the Indochi-
nese Communists concerned about their declining 
ability to expand international support of their 
cause. They have lost the propaganda initiative to 
the US with President Nixon's announcement of 
planned visits to Peking and Moscow. They are now 
continually in need of reassurance of the loyalty 
of the USSR and China and edgy about the possibil-
ity of a great-power settlement of the Indochina 
war "behind their backs." The seven-point peace 
plan they offered last summer not only has so far 
failed to put the US on the defensive, but, to 
Hanoi, it appears that pressures on the US for an 
accommodation on Communist terms have actually de-
clined. In the military sphere, the Communists 
have been unable to exploit the large-scale with-
drawals of US troops from Vietnam. 
The Communists are not without resources, however. 
Their building of ,a major military threat to Phnom 
Penh strengthens our belief that the Communists 
intend to try for some signficiant psychological 
gains during this dry season. They would hope to 
project an image of strength, capability, and de-
termination to fight in Indochina, regardless of 
US air and material support for their enemies. 
They clearly would use the impact of any spectacu-
lar victory to press their cause for total US with-
drawal from the area. 
Cambodia: The First Thrust  
Hanoi may believe Cambodia will yield the most lu-
crative psychological and military gains in the im-
mediate weeks to come. The North Vietnamese seem 
to reason that a series of defeats inflicted on 
friendly forces in this theater, where operations 
are still relatively easy for the Communists and 
where world press coverage is plentiful, would im-
pact hard against US policy not only on Cambodia 
but also on Vietnam. 
Battlefield reports during the recent Communist at-
tacks on the Chenla forces north of Phnom Penh 
indicated that enemy troops were fighting with :a 
ferocity inconsistent with the military objective 
of inhibiting future' Cambodian advance toward Commu-
nist base areas and supply routes in northeastern 
Cambodia. The Communist troops may have been trying 
to administer a serious drubbing to their opponents 
in order to shatter the Cambodian Government's mo-
rale while simultaneously drawing a press reaction 
that would play up their continued strength and 
prowess.

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
The subsequent movement of at least two--and pos-
sibly three--enemy main force regiments into a posi-
tion directly threatening Phnom Penh smacks largely 
of a move designed for psychological effect. The 
Communists really have little to gain militarily 
from an assault on the city, but for public impact 
penetration of the capital or even an extended siege 
would almost certainly attract much attention from 
the world press. The chances of a successful Com-
munist attack into Phnom Penh will decline the 
longer the Cambodians have to prepare defenses. 
Nonetheless, the Communists still appear to be in 
a good position to maintain for some time a credi-
ble threat to the capital, at a relatively cheap 
military cost. Aerial observers report the enemy 
is preparing fortified positions not far from the 
city. 
In the immediate future at least, the offensive of 
South Vietnamese units in eastern Cambodia around 
Route 7 will not relieve the Communist pressure on 
Phnom Penh. Enemy units near the city were not 
drawn from areas of eastern Cambodia where the ARVN 
will be operating. It is possible, however, that 
the South Vietnamese attack will draw to the east 
the 9th North Vietnamese Division from its opera-
tions against Cambodian troops in the Chenla II 
area. Some Cambodian units could then be freed for 
use around Phnom Penh. 
South Vietnam: A Harder Nut to Crack  
The Communists probably anticipated that the South 
Vietnamese would move into Cambodia to help take 
the pressure off friendly forces. There is some 
evidence  that the Communists 
believe this move will open opportunities for them 
to attack in the Military Region 3 area around 
Saigon. Such opportunities are restricted, however, 
to the border areas of Military Regions 1, 2, and 3. 
Communist elements, moving mostly from border sanc-
tuaries, can still concentrate in multiregimental 
strength and enjoy the advantage of short, relatively 
secure supply lines for limited operations. In the 
past, Communist operations in the border areas--pri-
marily sieges of friendly military strongpoints--
have often been depicted by much of the world press 
as reflecting continuing enemy strength and resolute-
ness, without regard for the fact that such opera-
tions have had little enduring impact on the secu-
rity of South Vietnam. A Communist campaign in the 
border sectors should be expected again during the 
coming dry season, particularly in the early months 
of 1972 when the weather favors such military opera-
tions in Military Regions 1 and 2, and when supplies 
and replacements coming through the Lao panhandle 
will be in place.

The allies received a foretaste of the border foray 
strategy last month when the enemy attacked with 
two divisions in the Krek - Tay Ninh Province bor-
der area. They hoped, according to a wide variety 
of sources, to score a victory over reacting South 
Vietnamese forces that would severely undercut 
claims of success for Vietnamization. Instead, the 
Communists took a notable beating and the South Viet-
namese seem to have emerged from the fray with in-
creased confidence. These two divisions must now 
hold off the new South Vietnamese venture into Cam-
bodia. 
Aside from military actions, a terrorist action of 
low cost but high psychological value against a 
target such as the US Embassy or MACV military head-
quarters cannot be ruled out at any point. 
Laos 
The North Vietnamese regard control of the Plaine 
des Jarres as the keystone of ?their strategy in 
north Laos, and they have expended considerable ef-
fort to prevent permanent erosion of their control. 
Since the Communists do not now hold the Plaine 
they will almost certainly attempt to recapture it. 
The Communists are now moving men and supplies to-
ward this area. The build-up is considerably larger 
this ?year than last, probably because the govern-
ment has more forces at its disposal in stronger 
positions and because in contrast to the last dry 
season the North Vietnamese must regain the Plaine 
before they can push toward Long Tieng. 
The chances are better than even that the Commu-
nists will also hit hard in the next few months in 
the BoZovens area of south Laos. The government 
has made substantial gains there during the rainy 
season, retaking Saravane, Paksong, and now the 
logistics center at Ban Phone, The Communists will 
almost certainly try to get these towns back, both 
to forestall further government inroads into the in-
filtration corridor and to open an alternate suppZy 
route along the eastern edge of the BoZovens. In 
the eastern panhandle there is evidence that Hanoi 
fears another substantial' ground incursion into the 
corridor this year by allied ground forces and is 
strengthening its forces in the area to meet such a 
challenge. 
The Balance Sheet  
However much Hanoi may be convinced that it must 
show Communist military muscZe, its means for doing 
so are slimmer than in the past. Troop replace-
ments for Communist forces in Cambodia and South

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
Vietnam have not fully kept pace with attrition 
during the past year. Overall, the enemy faces the 
coming dry season with troop strength perhaps five 
to ten percent below last year when its operations, 
by military standards, failed to make significant, 
lasting gains in South Vietnam. Communist forces 
are still feeling a severe supply pinch. US ground 
force strength is of course rapidly declining but 
by contrast, the supplies, manpower, morale, and 
combat readiness of friendly forces in Indochina, 
on the whole, are slightly improved over last year. 
If Hanoi does achieve some sort of military victory, 
the North Vietnamese will want to exploit it in the 
political sphere. With Le Due Tho heading back to 
Paris it seems certain that the North Vietnamese 
plan to try to refocus Western attention on their 
demands. We have noticed some hints that a new 
political formula might be forthcoming in Paris, 
but recent propaganda statements from Hanoi so far 
leave the regime committed to the seven points. In 
public, the North Vietnamese have recently been more 
explicit about their demands for a complete termina-
tion of every type of American military involvement 
in Indochina--a position that takes them back to 
some of their harder-Zine periods of the past. If 
they could pull off a few ostentatious military 
successes, there would be even more reason to ex-
pect them to continue to hold a hard negotiating 
position.
