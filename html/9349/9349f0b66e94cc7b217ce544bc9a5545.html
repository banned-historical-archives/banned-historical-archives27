Lewis quite obviously never has known 
the rapture of a west Texas dawn where 
the sun flames crimson on the rugged 
canyon Walls and the day opens big as 
all outdoors. 
Someday when Mr. Lewis' lnngs are 
choked with smog and his nostrils of-
fended by the exhaust fumes of the east-
ern metropolis, his nerves a jangle from 
the raucous bleetings of the auto horn, 
lie should seek a week of serene repose in 
the lush, semitropical beauty of the Rio 
Grande Valley where the fragrance of 
some budding plant forever scents the 
atmosphere, multicolored foliage salves 
the eyes, and where the nerves are 
balmed at siesta time by the gentle strok-
ing of guitars. 
Or perhaps he should take a leisurely 
canter 0X1 horseback through the Texas 
hill country in springtime when blue-
bonnets cover the meadows with an azure 
blanket, or relax by gondola through the 
picturesque downtown meanderings of 
the San Antonio River beneath the 
storied Alamo, or drive the freeway be-
tween Fort Worth and Dallas where the 
skylines of the twin cities loom breath-
takingly out of the plain. 
I wish he could visit Six Flags over 
Texas, or the Chandor Gardens in 
Weatherford, or Houston's Astrodome, or 
the Sunken Gardens of Brackenridge 
Park, or the Botanic Gardens of Fort 
Worth. 
NQ scenic beauties? Texas has so 
many we cannot even name them all. 
ASSATEAGUE ISLAND 
(Mr. TODD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 min-
ute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TODD. Mr. Speaker, have be-
come concerned by the shortage of ade-
quate public beach facilities in the mid-
dle Atlantic coastal region. Cape Cod 
ha, relieved the pressure for swimming 
areas In New England, and the Fire Is-
land National Seashore seems adequate 
for New York City, but there is a long 
gap between Fire Island and the next 
national seashore south, Cape Hatteras, 
N.C. 
Assateague Island, it seems to me, is 
the logical solution to this problem, and 
I urge that we take immediate action to 
Make the island a national seashore. 
Assateague is ideally located to serve 
the large portion of our eastern populace 
which now has little or no access to good 
beaches. Within a 250-mile radius of 
the island live over 34 million people, 
one-fifth of our entire population, most 
in the large metropolitan areas of Wash-
ington, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Wil-
mington, and Richmond. And there 
seems little doubt that Assateague could 
accommodate this terrific demand. The 
Department of the Interior recently esti-
mated that a national seashore at Assa-
teague could probably serve 3 million 
each year. 
This spring I spent two weekends on 
Assateague, and I am convinced that it 
would be perfect as a national seashore. 
The southern tip a the island is quite 
WOOdeci and m.arshy, an ideal refuge for 
110---:2 
thousands of ducks, geese, and swans, as 
well as the 'famous wild ponies. The 
northern end, on the other hand, is a 
long, wide beach. The water tempera-
ture there is moderate, and the dropoff 
gradual. Even on rough days, I am told, 
there is virtually no undertow. In short, 
it is an ideal swimming area. 
At the same time, because of its topog-
raphy, Assateague is not at all suited 
for private cottages or summer resi-
dences. In the first place, if many homes 
were built there, before long, there would 
be a terrific sewage disposal problem. In 
an effort to prevent sewage contamina-
tion on the island, the Maryland State 
Health Department has banned all sep-
tic tanks. It feels that the only solu-
tion to the problem is a fairly compli-
cated sewage system?a system much too 
costly to be financed by any private land 
developer. 
But the main reason that Assateague 
is not suitable for private housing de-
velopment is that it often floods. In the 
hurricane of March 1962, for example, 
the island was almost completely sub-
merged. The Washington Post's ac-
count of the storm read: 
In. * * * the great storm, the ocean rolled 
right across Assateague into Chincoteague 
Bay at perhaps five points. Dunes were 
washed away and the sand deposited in what 
had been swamps. The shoreline was 
moved, leaving former beaches deep under 
water. One summer house, built fore-
sightedly on deep pilings in the dunes, was 
left with its doorstep out of reach above the 
new ground level. 
, ? 
In short, I feel that the arguments in 
favor of a national seashore at Assa-
teague are indisputable: There is a ter-
rific need for swimming facilities in this 
area; Assateague has an ideal beach; and 
it is completely unsuitable for private 
ownership and development. It is my 
hope, therefore, that in the near future 
the House Committee on Interior and 
Insular Affairs will hold hearings on the 
Assateague National Seashore bills, and 
that it will see fit to act favorably on 
them. A Senate committee has already 
done so, and it is of the utmost urgency 
and importance that we follow suit. 
NEW YORK STATE MOVING TO-
WARD ADOPTION OF LOTTERY AS 
A SOUND SOCIAL AND REVENUE 
DEVICE 
(Mr. FINO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 min-
ute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. FINO. Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, 
I spoke before this House to announce 
that the New York State Senate had 
voted in favor of a State lottery by a 
2-to-1 majority. Today, it is my pleasure 
to announce that the State assembly fol-
lowed suit and also voted in favor of a 
resolution for a constitutional amend-
ment to establish a State lottery. I am 
happy to say that the assembly did so 
by a majority of 8 to 1. 
This, Mr. Speaker, means that a State 
lottery is about to become a reality in 
New York. After next year's legislative 
action on this proposal, the people will 
have an opportunity to vote on it in 
1966. 
I am confident that this lottery pro-
posal, which I have supported for a long 
time, will win an overwhelming victory 
because the people want a lottery to help 
ease their tax burdens. 
There is no doubt that New York has 
immense illegal gambling activity which 
should be tapped for the public good. I 
am confident that a lottery in New York 
will cut heavily into the multibillion-
dollar gambling activity which has been 
for too long a monopoly of the under-
world crime syndicates. 
New York proposes to use lottery reve-
nues for education?this will certainly 
be a great boom to education in New 
York. 
The legalization of a State lottery in 
New York will prove to our neighboring 
States that hypocrisy costs money. I 
say this because people from all over the 
United States will look forward to the 
opportunity to buy a New York State lot-
tery ticket. 
Let me say, Mr. Speaker, that the New 
York State Legislature's vote on the lot-
tery proposal is further evidence of a 
growing trend toward the lottery idea as 
a sound social and revenue device?a 
trend which will be more and more felt 
even in the Coni the years go by. 
F( Again& 
e4114-447 
(Mr. CALLAWAY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks and include extraneous matter.) 
Mr. CALLAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I feel 
certain that of all the various phases of 
this Nation's foreign policy, the one in 
which this Congress is most interested 
is the war in Vietnam. 
I have this week returned from a brief 
tour of that country, the purpose of 
which was to better my understanding of 
the situation through firsthand experi-
ence. During the week I was briefed by 
Ambassador Johnson, met with General 
Westmoreland, had briefings at three of 
the four corps areas in South Vietnam, 
met with the commanding generals of 
? 
the Marines in Danang and of the 173d 
Airborne Brigade at Bien Hoa. I talked 
with American colonels, captains and 
sergeants; with U.S. advisers to the 
Vietnamese army at all levels. I talked 
with the Vietnamese officers and men. 
For 3 days, dressed in fatigues and 
armed with a carbine, I talked with our 
troops all the way from the rice paddies 
of the Mekong Delta to the mountain 
command posts overlooking Danang. 
While I certainly do not want to in-
timate that I could become an expert on 
Vietnam in 1 week, I do feel that I had 
the opportunity to learn a good deal more 
about the situation and our mission 
there. 
In an effort to share my opinions on 
the war with my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent to insert a 
speech that I gave last Saturday before 
the 45th Annual convention of the Dis-
abled American Veterans of Georgia, re-
cording my thoughts and observations 
on the war.

13470 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- HOUSE June 17, 1965 
In addition, Mr. Speaker, I have taken 
a special order this afternoon for the 
purpose of enlarging and detailing my 
remarks. I invite all my colleagues to 
join with me this afternoon in discussing 
the situation in Vietnam. 
The speech is as follows: 
THE WAR IN VIETNAM 
(Speech of Hon. HOWARD H. CALf.swsy be-
fore the 45th annual convention of the 
Disabled American Veterans of Georgia, 
June 12, 1965) 
The war in Vietnam is a different kind of 
war. It is in no war comparable to World 
War I, World War II, or the 'Korean war. 
This is the classic war of liberation. This is 
the kind of war that Mao Tse-tung and his 
Chinese Communists understand and want 
to fight all over the world. This is the kind 
of wax that Mr. Khrushchev praised in his 
famous speech of January 6, 1961; it is the 
kind of war that Castro's Che Guevara de-
scribes in the field manuals that are being 
circulated today throughout Latin America; 
and this is the kind of war that will break 
out all over the world if we allow it. 
A war of liberation is a phantom war that 
we hardly understand. It can best be de-
scribed in Mao Tse-tung's words that "Our 
guerrillas will swim in a sea of peasants." 
Mao's classic war of liberation has three 
phases: the first phase is entirely guerrilla 
action, In the second phase the guerrillas 
group together in units of company to regi-
ment size, attack and then fade away. The 
third phase is conventional war In which the 
guerrillas actually seize territory. 
The war with the Vietcong today is in the 
second phase. Vietcong troops assemble al-
most at will in strengths up to regimental 
size, attack or ambush, and then vanish. 
They never stand to fight against superior 
forces, but always melt away into the sea of 
humanity. They live off the land, which is 
not difficult, for around each village there 
are coconut trees, fruit trees, and hundreds 
of pounds of rice stored in each home. 
This is a war of terror. A standard Viet-
cong tactic is to attack a village in which 
the villagers have been friendly to the Re-
public of Vietnam or to the United States, 
and assassinate in a cruel fashion those who 
have cooperated. In 1964 alone, some 500 
village chiefs were assassinated and more 
than twice that many kidnaped. This points 
out the obvious necessity of giving security 
to each of the villages. It is hard to get 
people to stand up for us when we can't pro-
tect them. 
While this war has many aspects of a civil 
war, of Vietnamese fighting Vietnamese, I 
want to point out strongly that the Vietcong 
are supplied and directed totally from North 
Vietnam and Hanoi. Over 20,000 hard-core 
Vietcong are known to have come down the 
Ho Chi Minh trails into South Vietnam. 
Ther have trained, recruited, and kidnaped 
some 60,000 local Vietnamese into the Viet-
cong service; arms and ammunition are sup-
plied from Hanoi. Most of these are light 
armaments such as 60-millimeter mortars, 
57-millimeter recoiless rifles, and a new se-
ries of 7.62-millimeter small arms weapon. A 
significance of the new Weapons is that they 
are manufactured in Communist nations and 
are of a different caliber from anything our 
forces are using. This means that the Viet-
cong are now so sure of their lines of supply 
that they no longer need to rely on captured 
weapons, but can count on supplying their 
own. Most of the weapons come in junks 
and sampans down the coast from North 
Vietnam. 
How can Atnericrens fight such an alien 
and unfamiliar type of war? The war is 
being fought today primarily by the Army 
of the Republic of Vietnam, ARVN. They 
are fighting it first with regular troops, 
quickly meeting VC attacks before they can 
disappear. Helicopters are being used ex-
tensively and the ARVN is continually de-
veloping new successful techniques. But 
primarily the war is being fought by a pro-
gram of rural reconstruction. This program 
has replaced the strategic hamlet program 
and has the same purpose of providing 
security to friendly villages. 
The Vietcong controls a very large part 
of the territory of South Vietnam, but the 
Republic of Vietnam controls most of the 
large population centers in all of the 45 
provinces. The idea of rural reconstruction 
is to start with the population center al-
ready controlled, and then like a spreading 
drop of oil, move out slowly taking more 
and more areas under the control of the 
Republic of Vietnam. As this control 
spreads, regular army ARVN forces are re-
placed by both regional forces, and by popu-
lar forces who together secure the areas from 
the Vietcong. As soon as an area is secure 
civilian government is established in cooper-
ation with the armed forces. 
This is how the Vietnamese are fighting 
their war, and it seems to me a very sound 
method of fighting it. 
And what are we doing to help? First 
of all we are providing advisers at all levels 
to the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. In 
each of the four corps areas there is a senior 
American adviser, a full colonel. He works 
hand in hand with the Vietnamese corps 
commander giving tactical advice, helping 
with training, and coordinating the Ameri-
can Air Force units. Similarly, American 
advisers are working side by side with divi-
sion, regimental and battalion commanders 
as well as with province chiefs and district 
chiefs. 
This program is working extremely well. 
Of the hundreds of advisers I saw, each 
worked in close cooperation with his Viet-
namese counterpart. The Americans had 
nothing but praise for the Vietnamese Army 
and for the courage and fighting ability of 
the Vietnamese soldiers. 
The one problem with the Vietnamese 
Army is that of leadership. During their 
tenure, the French did not train native 
leaders, and it is only now that leaders are 
being trained. This takes time, but wherever 
there is good leadership, the Vietnamese sol-
diers fight Well. In the few instances where 
they have not fought well, it has always 
been attributed to poor leadership. One 
significant example was of a battalion in 
a heavy fight recently that was doing ex-
tremely well until its battalion commander 
was killed. As there was no one to step in 
and take over the leadership, the battalion 
fell apart. Our advisers are playing a signifi-
cant role today in providing and training 
the necessary depth of leadership. 
In addition to advisers, we are also fight-
ing the war with operational American 
troops. We have the 3d Marine Division 
whose mission it is to protect the three air-
fields of Phu Bai, Danang, and Chu Lai in 
the northern part of the country, and the 
173d Airborne Brigade stationed near Ben 
Hoa and operating in that area. These are 
conventional American troops with specific 
missions such as the protection of airfields. 
We have to realize that our troops are operat-
ing as guests in a friendly sovereign coun-
try. This is frustrating at times, but the 
problems are being worked out as the spirit 
of cooperation is strengthened between the 
two nations. For example, when the marines 
first came into Danang they were assigned 
to a sector much too small to carry out their 
mission of defending the Danang Airbase. 
Yet as the marines have operated and 
showed the local Vietnamese that they are 
careful net to harrn any of the civilian 
population, their sector of responsibility has. 
been increased. 
Our third tactic in fighting this war is to 
interdict the Vietcong supply routes by air 
strikes north of the 17th parallel into North 
Vietnam. Generally the air attacks are held 
below the 20th parallel, with only an oc-
casional strike above that line. Although 
our pilots are encountering antiaircraft fire, 
and from time to time lose aircraft, the 
strikes have been quite effective in cutting 
supply lines in this limited area. But the 
real problem is that the Vietcong needs such 
a small amount of supplies, using no petro-
leum and no food and very little ammuni-
tion. It has been found that if we knock 
out a bridge one day the next day supplies 
are routed around to ferry sites. Therefore, 
these strikes are effective, in that they are 
making matters more difficult for the North 
Vietnamese, but they in no way stop the 
supplies that are needed for the Vietcong. 
Most of the supplies eventually find their 
way to the Vietcong by sea and rivers in 
junks and sampans. 
My assessment of the war in Vietnam is 
that under the present circumstances we are 
winning. This month we are in better shape 
than we were a month ago, and a month ago 
we were in better shape than we were 2 
months ago. In each of the Provinces, the 
area under control of the Republic of Viet-
nam spreads out week by week. The Viet-
cong seems to be maintaining its strength, 
but it is getting no stronger. And added to 
this is the encouraging fact that the morale 
of both American troops and Vietnamese 
troops is extremely high. As a matter of 
fact, most of the commanders that I talked 
with felt that morale was higher than they 
had ever seen it in any operation in war 
or peace. We can be extremely proud of 
our fighting men. 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
From my brief visit I would make the fol-
lowing recommendations: 
1. I think that we should do everything 
we can to explain to our people that this 
is a Vietnamese war and not our own. Our 
role is only to help, not to take over. Cer-
tainly it would be a great mistake to get 
into the position of fighting a major ground 
war on the mainland of Asia. I hope that 
with our help and advice, the Vietnamese 
troops will be able to control the Vietcong 
without U.S. Operational forces and that 
perhaps within the next year all U.S. forces 
except advisors might be pulled out safely. 
I say this even as additional U.S. oper-
ational troops are being moved into Viet-
nam. I support the move of additional 
troops as necessary to protect ourselves 
against the threat of a new kind of war, an 
attack by regular operational armed forces. 
Should this war in Vietnam change from 
the present war against the Vietcong to a 
different kind of war against regular forces 
of North Vietnam, China or Russia, then 
we would have to analyze the situation and 
change our plans accordingly. I cannot 
speculate on what our reaction to such an 
event might be, but I hope that it would 
be firm, and with the full consideration of 
all of the resources at our command. I 
might say in passing that in some respects 
a war against an overt aggression would be 
easier to fight than the present one. 
But I return to my point that the war 
against the Vietcong guerillas should be 
fought by the Vietnamese, not by U.S. opera-
tional troops. We should continue to help 
the Vietnamese with advisers, military and 
economic assistance, and most of all with 
training and leadership; but we should Let 
them fight their own war, which with our 
help they are perfectly capable and willing to 
do. Let me say that in the role of advisers 
and helpers. I think we are committed to a 
long-range program of many years duration. 
2. We should consider a change in the 
ground rules for bombing north. There are 
new and dangerous military targets in the 
Hanoi area. Specifically, the 11-28 Russian 
jets and the SAM missiles. I would hope we 
would consider bombing these military tar-

gets within the next few days. This is a 
decision that only the President" Can and 
should make, and its iniplicationi are great: 
'2'et there is perhaps more danger involved 
in allowing establishment of these sites, UI-
timely inviting Russian jets to attack us 
In South Vietnam and Russian missiles to 
shoot down our planes, than to destroy these 
military targets promptly and eliminate their 
danger. 
*8. We should consider some kind of politi-
cal solution whereby the free world would 
gain from the war in Vietnam. As it is now, 
Ho Chi Minh, the North Vietnamese leader, 
can at any moment call a halt and negotiate 
according to the 1954 Geneva agreement 
which divides the country into North and 
South Vietnam. In that event, we would be 
' back right where we were, and then after 
a rnpnth or 6 months, the North Vietnamese 
001ddstart the war all over again. As the sit-
? uation npw stands, the North Vietnamese 
have nothing to lose but everything to gain 
and thus It is to their advantage to continue. 
Thus the free world will have to set an ob-
pctive beyond returning to the status quo. 
.?Perhaps we will have to make some plan 
for liberating North Vietnam from Corn-
num:1st control so that the rulers in Hanoi 
?1/27,111 know that they do have something to 
lose. Until then I see very little hope in 
stopping their aggressions. 
? My final comment is that we in America 
?can be extremely proud of our fighting 
troops, They are fighting the most dif-
flout war that can be imagined in the finest 
traditions' a our Nation. Let us at home be 
firm, and give them the backing that they 
deserve for if we do they will never let us 
down. 
CONFLICT BETWEEN THE AMATEUR 
ATHLETIC UNION AND THE NA-
TIONAL COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC 
ASSOCIATION 
(Mr. MICHEL asked and was given 
? permission to address the House for 1 
MinUte.) 
-Mr. 1VIICHEL, Mr. Speaker, the situa-
tion in ainateur athletics is seriously em-
broiled in what appears to be irreconcil-
able copflict hetWeen the Amateur 
Athletic ,Union and the National Col-
legiate Athletic Association.- I have 
written the PreSident, and hope many 
1W-embers would do likewise,. urging his 
hiterCession to resolve the controversy, 
possibly by the appointment of a special 
blue-ribbon commission. 
I believe it would be very unfair if 
our young athletes should suffer by not 
being permitted to compete in various 
*Etc% and field meets because their elders 
are argctng over who has jurisdiction 
over them. 
We have an international traek meet 
with the soviet Union coming up this 
year. ? At the National AAU meet, 
scheduled for June 26 and 27, partici-
pants will compete for places to repre-
sent our Nation. It would be unfortu-
nate and unforgiveable if because of this 
disunity between the AAU and the 
NCAA our best athletes were pro-
? hibited from competing for places by 
the administrative default of those w1.1.9 
seek to be responsible for the conduct of 
aMateUr, athletics. For example, the 
,iviclely heralded Randy Matson, of Texas 
A. 8; M,, who has broken the world's 
shotput record, would be foreclosed from 
competing in the National AAU meet, 
urflesa pOillething is done. And of course 
this would also amply to a host of other 
college and university star performers. 
What is needed is a blue-ribbon com-
mission, headed by someone like the late 
Douglas McArthur, whom President 
Kennedy had appointed, to bring these 
two organizations together and agree on 
binding arbitration of their differences, 
and I call on the President to take im-
mediate and appropriate steps. Time 
is of the essence. 
ANNUAL CONGRESSIONAL 
BALLGAME 
(Mr. CONTE asked and was granted 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CONTE. Mr. Speaker, as you 
know, it will soon be time once again 
for the Republicans to assemble their 
baseball team at District of Columbia, 
Stadium to claim our annual victory over 
a similar group of sports from the other 
side. I speak, of course of the annual 
congressional game scheduled for the 
end of this month. I wish to take this 
opportunity to again invite the Speaker 
and the minority leader to be our guest 
of honor on June 30,1965. 
I am pleased to serve once again as 
coach, manager, and star player for the 
Republican team. Although we are 
badly outnumbered and have been in 
recent years, I am confident we will again 
demonstrate that superior skill has more 
to do with the outcome than superior 
numbers. 
That undoubtedly has a great deal to 
do with the events I wish to relate here 
this morning, events concerning a rather 
startling piece of treachery on the part 
of our opponents. In spite of their over-
whelming manpower advantage, our op-
ponents have again been reduced to 
underhanded guerrilla warfare in an 
effort to stave off certain defeat again 
this year. 
They have attempted to shanghi one 
of our most promising prospects this 
year, my learned colleague and honor-
able gentleman from Tennessee, the 
heavy-hitting JOHN DUNCAN. My Col-
league was invited to sign with the other 
team in a manuever reminiscent of the 
infamous "Black Sox" scandal of 1919, 
and the ill-fated attempt by one of our 
Latin American neighbor countries to 
lure our big league stars away from us 
after World War II. 
I consider this an act of treachery and 
underhanded perfidy that goes against 
all our American traditions of sports-
manship, statesmanship, and collective 
bargaining. I must admit I am seriously 
considering a formal protest before the 
House Un-American Activities Com-
mittee. 
I am stunned by the audacity of the 
learned manager of the other team who, 
by this act, demonstrates his contempt 
for the national pastime and for the 
skills of his colleagues. I must say in all 
fairness, however, that he is able to rec-
ognize a loser when he has one and I 
can understand his earnest desire to help 
his cause no matter what the risk or the 
pOsSible consequences. 
I am confident that truth and justice, 
13471 
in the resplendent uniforms of the Re-
publican team, will win out in the end. 
Mr. Speaker, I have dispatched the fol-
lowing letter to the manager and play-
ing coach of the Democratic team, the 
Honorable HARLAN HAGEN: 
DEAR HARLAN : It has just come to my at-
tention that Is spite of your overwhelming 
manpower advantage the Democratic forces 
have again been reduced to psychological 
warfare with regard to the annual Demo-
cratic-Republican baseball game. The un-
derhanded attempt to sign the Honorable 
JOHN J. DUNCAN away from the Republican 
squad has been paralleled only by the 
notorious Black Box scandal in the annals of 
baseball history. Remembering the so-called 
"secret strategy" charges of last year, how-
ever, the above act of aggression does not 
seem inconsistent with prevailing Demo-
cratic policy. 
This is to notify you that an official pro-
test will be lodged before the House Un-
American Activities Committee at the earliest 
possible convenience. The dedicated loyalty 
of Representative DUNCAN and the other 
Members of the outnumbered but never out-
played minority team leads me to expect a 
glorious victory on June 30, repeating last 
year's 6-to-5 triumph by an even greater 
margin. 
Again, such tactics from a man of your 
noted baseball ability are both shocking and 
injurious to the reputation of our national 
pastime, but truth and justice (in the uni-
forms of the Republican ball club) will win 
out in the end. 
Competitively yours, 
SILVIO 0. CONTE. 
YOUTH ACHIEVEMENT PROGRAM 
OF POUGHKEEPSIE EXCHANGE 
CLUB, DUTCHESS COUNTY, N.Y. 
(Mr. RESNICK asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. RESNICK. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like at this time to recognize the con-
tributions of the Poughkeepsie Exchange 
Club in Dutchess County, N.Y., for its 
fine record of interest in the youth of our 
Nation. 
Cognizant of the fact that the top 
ranking scholars receive ample recogni-
tion through scholarships and other 
awards, this club for several years has 
sponsored a youth achievement program. 
The ground rules for the selection of out-
standing students to be recognized were 
set as follows. 
He or she must be a well rounded person 
exhibiting not only a superior scholastic rec-
ord but a record of contribution and lead-
ership in such things as sports, clubs, stu-
dent government within the school, and 
scouting, 4-H, church, charities, etc., within 
the community as well. 
Nine Dutchess County high school stu-
dents, five girls and four boys, have been 
selected for this honor. Their names 
are: George Hritz, John Bernard Kane, 
Jr., Thomas E. Albro, Julia Hunter, 
Karen Mae Creswell, Nina Busick, Wil-
liam Sleeper, Maryellen Bagiackas, and 
Marilyn G. Tanner. Their individual 
records of accomplishment and commu-
nity interest constitute a fine example of 
the achievement of the youth of our Na-
tion. The delinquents and dropouts re-
ceive a great deal of attention in the na-
tional press. But it is good medicine to

VIETNAM 
The SPEAKER. Under a previous o 
der of the House, the gentleman f 
Georgia (Mr. CALLAWAY] is recognized 
for 60 minutes. 
Mr. CALLAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I have 
just returned from a week that will stand 
out in my memory as one of the most 
vivid and rewarding weeks of my life. I 
have just returned from a 1-week trip 
to South Vietnam. Certainly, as all 
Members realize, there is no way to be-
come an expert on any problem as com-
plex as the problem of the Vietnamese 
war in I week. I do not claim to be 
an expert, but I do feel that I had an 
unusual experience which I should like 
to share with you, my colleagues. 
I had the opportunity to hear brief-
ings at the highest level in Saigon?from 
Ambassador Johnson and from the offi-
cers of the Military Assistance Command 
In Vietnam. I met with General West-
moreland, I had the opportunity of go-
ing to all of our operational units?to 
the 3d Marine, Division in Da Nang and 
to the 173d Airborne Brigade at Bien 
Hoa. I received briefings at both of 
these places. 
I also went out with our patrols on the 
ground and talked with our enlisted men 
as well as our officers. I went into three 
of the four corps areas in South Viet-
nam, and at each of these places I talked 
with and was briefed by the command-
ing officers and their staffs. 
Further than that, particularly in the 
Mekong Delta rice paddies, I had an op-
portunity to go out on an operation that 
had just taken place, and I talked to 
men who had been only moments before 
engaged in combat with the Vietcong. 
I had a unique opportunity that per-
haps some of my colleagues will not be 
able to share, in that as a graduate of 
the West Point class of 1949, I found, 
wherever I went, many old friends and 
old classmates who, of course, were only 
too willing to share their experiences 
with me. 
I hope that as I discuss what I saw in 
Vietnam those of you who wish will join 
me in colloquy in these discussions this 
afternoon. 
The first and foremost impression I 
received from Vietnam is that this is an 
entirely different kind of war. This is 
unlike what we in this country think of 
as war. It certainly bears no relation to 
the trenches of World War I or the hard 
conventional fighting of World War U. 
I would like to say it even bears no re-
semblance whatsoever to the War in Ko-
rea. This war today being fought by 
the Vietcong is what the Communists 
call a "war of liberation." This is the 
kind of war Mr. Khrushchev spoke of so 
glowingly in his famous speech of Janu-
ary 6, 1961. It is the kind of war Mr. 
Che Guevara, Castro's man, writes field 
manuals about?field manuals that are 
now being used in training guerrillas - 
from Latin and South America. It is 
the kind of war espoused by Mao Tse-
tung and about which he speaks when 
he says, "Our guerrillas will swim in a 
sea of peasants." My point is that this 
is an entirely different kind of war from 
anything we have fought. It is the kind 
of war where our major and first prob-
lem is to find an enemy who merely 
evaporates and goes out of sight. Be-
cause this is a new kind of war, a "war 
of liberation," it takes on a special im-
portance. Every single senior officer I 
spoke with in Vietnam told me that this 
is a war we must win. This is the clas-
sic "war of liberation." This is the war 
that all Communist leaders have told 
us we will be having throughout the 
world. If the Communists win, we can 
expect immediately similar wars not only 
in southeast Asia where we all hear of 
the domino theory but throughout the 
entire world, particularly in Africa and 
Latin and South America. 
The people with whom I have talked 
said with all conviction that the very 
moment the Chinese, the Russians, and 
the North Vietnamese think that they 
can win this "war of liberation," other 
"wars of liberation" will start through-
out the world. By the same token, if we 
in this country can show to the people 
of the world that we can win on the con-
tinent of southeast Asia, in the backyard 
of the Communists, then we will certain-
ly go a long way toward stopping these 
wars throughout the world. 
This classical war of liberation is 
fought in three phases. The first phase 
is strictly guerrilla warfare with very 
small units. In the second classical 
phase, the guerrillas get together in com-
pany, battalion, and even regimental 
size to attack, then fade back into the 
sea of humanity. In the third phase of 
the conflict, the guerrillas mass and ac-
tually seize and hold territory. Today in 
South Vietnam we are in the second 
phase. The Vietcong control about half 
of the actual land of South Vietnam. 
They can mass anywhere in this territory 
at regimental strength and sometimes 
with the strength of two to three regi-
ments. They can mass, they can hit 
hard, they can ambush, and they can 
do their devastation. When our troops 
come to fight, unless they come quickly, 
the Vietcong have evaporated and are 
completely lost. You cannot find them. 
They live off the terrain. It is very easy 
to do, because in the places I saw, par-
ticularly in the southern part of the 
country, every village is surrounded by 
coconut and fruit trees, and in each 
home there are huricireds of pounds of 
rice stored the year around. It provides 
the perfect setting for guerrillas to live 
off the land and melt in among the peas-
ants and villagers. 
I would like to point out also that this 
is a war of terror. You have heard, as 
pointed out in the State Department 
white paper, that 500 village chiefs have 
been killed in 1964 alone and over twice 
the many kidnaped. These are village 
chiefs. Many times that number of just 
plain civilians have been killed, kid-
naped, and captured. Five hundred 
may not sound like so many, but if we 
think of the equivalent of their popula-
tion to our population, it is the equiva-
lent in 1 year of 20,000 U.S. mayors 
killed or kidnaped. This is a genuine 
war of terror. 
These people were killed or kidnaped 
for the sole reason that they had been 
loyal to us or to the Republic of Viet-
nam or had supported our program. So 
it is obvious that we cannot be effective 
in Vietnam unless we give these loyal 
Vietnamese our protection. 
There were a few little things that 
made me aware of the unique nature of 
this war. First of all, I was able to go 
on a civilian passport. More than that, 
at the airport in Saigon, while I was tak-
ing off in a Marine C-54, on the runway 
just landing was a Pan American civilian 
707. Three planes behind me was a 
Hong Kong Airlines plane going to Hong 
Kong; immediately in front of me was an 
Army F-100 armed with bombs, taking 
off for a mission, and between my plane 
and the Hong Kong plane were two 
South Vietnamese Air Force planes go-
ing into action against the Vietcong. 
Civilian planes took off along with Air 
Force fighters going out to do their job. 
And to further point out the difference 
between this and other wars, I was told 
that Vietnamese nationals travel from 
one end of the country to the other, 
through Vietcong territory daily on a 
routine basis on local buses. There were 
Vietcong inspection check points, paying 
charges, and so forth. 
I point this out to show that there are 
no front lines. This is certainly a mixed-
up kind of war, from our viewpoint. 
When you speak of the Vietcong you 
often think of men loosely joined to-
gether, but they are much more than 
that. I found that the Vietcong have 
their own government, they have their 
own mayors, and they collect taxes. Sur-
prisingly, they have their own APO num-
bers for their troops and have even been 
known to issue war bonds. 
In some ways it is like a civil war be-
cause you have Vietnamese fighting Viet-
namese. But I would say without ques-
tion that this is not a standard civil war, 
because the Vietcong is supplied, fur-
nished, and controlled from Hanoi. 
There is no question about that. The 
State Department White Papers have re-
ferred to 20,000 known Vietcong who 
have come down over the Ho Chi Mirth 
Trails from North Vietnam. We know 
that they have recruited or kidnaped at 
least 60,000 men from South Vietnam to 
join their hard core units. So they have 
a Vietcong force of almost 100,000 now 
in South Vietnam. 
And while this does not seem to be too 
many, the traditional or classic rule for 
fighting guerrillas is that conventional 
troops need to have at least 10 times as 
many people as the guerrillas in order to 
hold them. 
I have said that the Vietcong are com-
pletely supplied today from Hanoi. They 
have no munitions factories. They have 
Approved For Release 2003/10/15 : CIA-RDP67600446R000300180024-4 
Approved For Reie 
June 17, 1965 CO 
no Way of getting weapons. They are no 
longer capturing the weapons that they 
need. The supplies come from Hanoi 
and are carried mostly by sea in junks, 
sampans, and different kinds of small 
Vessels. 
Many of the major rivers in South 
Vietnam are controlled by the Vietcong. 
It is an ,interesting thing to see the 
use of these rivers. In the Mekong Delta 
there are over 2,000 miles of rivers and 
canals with a navigable depth of 61/2 
feet. This is more than the total of the 
roads and navigable trails in that same 
area, and the Vietcong controls a great 
deal of this waterway. 
I would like topoint out that they need 
very little in the way of supplies, how-
ever. They need no food whatsoever. 
They need no oil Or gas of any-kind. The 
Only supplies they really need or receive 
In quantity are 60-millimeter mortar 
ammunition, 5'7-millimeter recoilless 
rifle ammunition, and weapons some-
what similar to our .30 caliber weapons. 
-One of the interesting things is that 
they have just been supplied with new 
and modern '7,0-millimeter weapons 
Made in the Communist countries. Our 
ammunition will not fit any of those new 
weapons. They must be sure of their 
source of supply from Hanoi, because in 
the past they have relied heavily on 
captured ammunition, which will no 
longer be useful to them. 
Mr. Speaker, my point then is that 
this Is a new and different kind of war. 
The question is how do we fight it. The 
Way that we fight it is basically with the 
Regular Army of the Republic of Vietnam 
called Arvin, Army of the Republic of 
Vietnam. We fight it in conventional 
Ways where possible. We fight it partic-
ularly well with helicopters. As the Viet-
cong ambushes and moves fast, we try 
to. Use everything we can to strike back 
qtickly. Sometimes we catch themand 
destroy them. The difficulty is finding 
the enemy. 
Mr. Speaker, the Vietcong operates al-
Most entirely at night. 'We have had to 
set up clever ambushes in order to catch 
them at night. This phase of the opera-
tion is going better and better. Our air 
strikes, coupled with those strikes of the 
Vietnamese Air Force are doing an ex-
tremely effective job against the enemy. 
We have complete superiority of the air 
there now. 
But, Mr. Speaker, the basic program 
for winning the war in Vietnam is one 
that is called- rural reconstruction. 
This replaces the old "strategic hamlet" 
concept and yet is serving the same pur-
pose. While it is true that the Vietcong 
controls a great deal of the territory of 
Vietnam they control very few popula-
tion centers. 
There are 45 provinces in Vietnam, 
the province being the nearest equiva-
lent to pur State. All provinces have 
population centers under the control of 
the Republic of Vietnam. 
The rural reconstruction program 
starts with the population centers already 
under control. The plan then is to move 
OU,t trom, these population centers like 
spreading drops of oil, little by little, 
until tne spreading centers join the en-
tire country as one. They move first 
se 200$/10/15 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000300180024-4

with regular army troops. The troops 
clear out the Vietcong and set up a good 
civilian government. Then they recruit 
and train civilians into regional forces 
and popular forces, whose duty it is to 
protect the villages after the regular 
army unit moves out. 
Obviously, Mr. Speaker, the whole 
problem is to secure these areas and 
grant the protection that is needed. 
I would like to say that this program 
is working well and that our area is ex-
panding in every province that I visited. 
This is the basic way that the war is 
being fought by the Army of the Repub-
lic of Vietnam. 
Mr. Speaker, what is the role of the 
United States in this operation? 
Basically, our role is as advisers. We 
have active advisers at every level, Ameri-
cans who are working with the Viet-
namese troops. We have a full colonel 
as a senior adviser to each Vietnamese 
corps. We have officers at the division 
level, the regimental level, and the bat-
talion level who are training side by side 
and fighting sideby side with the Viet-
namese troops. Our advisers live, eat, 
and sleep with their Vietnamese counter-
parts. 
Mr. Speaker I would like to say that 
I have heard nothing but the highest 
praise for our men who are serving and 
living under severe conditions to which 
they are not accustomed. 
Mr. Speaker, the Vietnamese are good 
soldiers. Our men. praise them. They 
are hard fighters. They are brave. 
They are taking extremely heavy casual-
ties and continuing to fight. But they 
have one real overriding problem; the 
problem of leadership. 
During their tenure in Vietnam, the 
French did not train native leaders. 
Certainly we are doing so now, but this 
takes time, and meanwhile, the lack of 
native leadership poses a big problem. 
A striking example of this was one bat-
talion fighting in the Second Corps area. 
The battalion was doing extremely well, 
until the battalion commander was 
killed, and then the group went com-
pletely to pieces and was routed. There 
are not enough qualified replacements 
to take the place of men killed. 
This poses the biggest problem to our 
advisers. These men are building Viet-
namese leadership but I would like to 
point out it is an extremely long range 
program. 
In another phase of the war, we are 
attacking the North with our aircraft. 
We are attacking basically from the 17th 
Parallel that divides North and South 
Vietnam to the 20th Parallel. 
There have been effective attacks on 
bridges, barracks, and ,major military 
targets in this area; the purpose of which 
has been to interdiet the supply routes 
of the Vietcong. But the 'Vietcong's 
needs are small. One Defense Depart-
ment official told me they could be sup-
plied with some 3 tons per day. It is 
inconceivable that 3 tons could supply 
the entire area, but I have said that they 
use no gasoline? no food, and only very 
light weapons. We make it difficult, but 
we do not stop the sup-plies. rf we bomb 
out a bridge, they simply ferry the am-
munition across the river. We are hin-
dering them; we are giving them trou-
ble, but they are getting through with 
the small supplies that they need. 
This is the basic situation in Vietnam 
as I see it: Our advisers are working well; 
the Vietnamese are fighting well. Basi-
cally, we are winning the war. 
I have not spoken of the second kind 
of war which, to many, appears to be 
imminent at any moment. This is the 
overt kind of war where we would face 
operational troops from North Vietnam, 
China, and even from Russia. This is a 
much more serious kind of war. But it 
is a war we are better trained and 
equipped to fight. At least you can find 
the enemy. "In order to be prepared to 
fight this kind of war, we have introduced 
our own operational troops commanded 
by American officers. An example is the 
3d Marine Division. They are protecting 
airfields in the northern part of the 
country and they are protecting us 
against the threat of armed operational 
troops from North Vietnam. 
We have the same situation with the 
173d Airborne Brigade. They have the 
mission of protecting us from the pos-
sibility of attack by operational troops. 
We know, as it has been announced, that 
additional U.S. operational troops will be 
sent to Vietnam soon. 
I would like to say this poses a whole 
lot of new problems when we put in our 
own troops, rather than advisers. You 
notice this everywhere you go. We 
have the problem of fighting in a 
friendly nation in which we are only 
guests. We cannot do as we did in 
Korea, for here we have a sovereign na-
tion. This creates a lot of problems, 
but I can say that by cooperation the 
Problems are being worked out and I 
hope they may be solved by now. If we 
should find large numbers of operational 
troops of China, Russia, and North 
Vietnam moving into the area, I cannot 
speculate on what we could or should do. 
I would hope, if this should happen, that 
we`will answer such a threat with resolve 
and firmness and will consider the use of 
all of the power at our command to an-
swer it. 
As a result of this trip and of the 
things I did see in a week, I have come 
up with some recommendations. 
The first recommendation is that we 
should realize that the Vietcong is being 
fought by the Vietnamese with the as-
sistance of our advisers. It is not our 
war. This is a Vietnamese war and our 
units should be used as advisers to help 
train the Vietnamese. 
I want to say again that I do support 
sending operational troops into Vietnam 
because I feel it may be necessary to pro-
tect our interests against other opera-
tional troops. But the long-range war 
against the Vietcong guerrillas should 
be fought by the Vietnamese. They are 
willing and capable of fighting their own 
war and with the help of our advisers 
and support they can continue to do 
that. 
I would like to say in this regard that 
I hope our operational troops will be able 
,to come back to our country in a short 
time?within a year or so. But I see no 
hope that our advisers will be able to 
come back within a short time. I feel

that this is a long-range war. We are 
still in Korea today and we may still be 
In Vietnam 20 years from now. 
a/1y second recommendation is that we 
should now consider bombing additional 
military targets in North Vietnam. We 
know that Russia has the IL-28 jets near 
Hanoi and the jets have a capability of 
bombing us in South Vietnam today. 
We know of the SAM missile sites in the 
same region. Either today or shortly, 
we may have jets bombing our bases and 
ships and missiles shooting down our 
aircraft. 
It seems to me that the President, 
whose decision it must be, must consider 
promptly the advisability of attacking 
these military targets. Some will say 
that this will escalate the war. But, in 
my opinion, there will be a much greater 
escalation of the war if we do not attack 
these targets and if we allow them to 
build in strength to the point of bombing 
us and shooting down planes?that to 
maavould be the greater escalation. 
A third recommendation is that we 
consider some kind of political solution 
whereby the free world would gain from 
the war in Vietnam. As it is now, the 
leaders of Hanoi have nothing to lose. 
Whenever they feel they may be losing 
the war, they can merely say that they 
will live up to the 1954 Geneva agree-
ment, since this is apparently our objec-
tive. They only need to say "we will stop 
breaking our word and stop trying to 
destroy South Vietnam." Since this is 
our apparent objective, we would stop 
our participation in the war on this basis 
as a great victory. But would it be a 
victory? 
In a month, or 3 months or 6 months, 
when the time was right, the leaders of 
Hanoi could start down the trails again 
to supply the Vietcong. 
All we are now asking for our expendi-
ture of American money and our ex-
penditure of American lives is for Hanoi 
to go back and do what they have al-
ready promised to do. But if we should 
have a further objective, then the situa-
tion would change. Suppose we should 
adopt as our objective a "unified Vietnam 
free from Communist control." We 
would then have something to win and 
conversely the leaders of Hanoi would 
have something to lose. I should think 
that our strength at the bargaining table 
would be greatly strengthened by such 
an approach. 
My fourth and final recommendation 
is a personal one to my colleagues. I 
hope that each of you will take the op-
portunity, if it is available, to go to Viet-
nam. Certainly, in the short time that 
any of us can give up to go there, one 
cannot learn all there is to know about 
any nation or any problem as complex 
as this, but I do feel that even in a short 
time there is a tremendous amount one 
can do and learn, and that such a trip 
would be most valuable. 
Finally, I should like to say that we 
can be proud of our troops in Vietnam. 
The morale is higher than I have ever 
seen it anywhere. All the leaders tell us 
this. They are doing the job. As of now, 
against the forces we are now fighting, 
we are winning. 
Mr. O'NEAL of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
will the gentleman yield 
Mr. CALLAWAY. I am happy to yield 
to the gentleman from Georgia. 
Mr. O'NEAL of Georgia. I commend 
my distinguished colleague from the 
Georgia delegation for his enlightening 
and comprehensive report on the situa-
tion in Vietnam. It is a mark of service 
above and beyond duty when a U.S. Con-
gressman pays his own expenses to gain 
firsthand knowledge of our efforts in 
southeast Asia. 
Above all, it is a mark of patriotism for 
an elected official to devote valuable time 
and accept personal risks in order to be 
of greater service to his constituents and 
to his country. 
It is indeed reassuring to hear Mr. 
CALLAWAY'S factual report. I feel that 
the gentleman is more qualified than 
most of us to make such an authorita-
tive report on the subject before us to-
day. He is a graduate of West Point 
Academy with a bachelor of science de-
gree in military engineering. He has 
also served as a commissioned officer 
in the U.S. Army Infantry. 
While no man can predict with cer-
tainty what the future course of events 
In southeast Asia will bring, the gentle-
man from Georgia has given us an in-
formed account of particular signif-
icance in the light of recent occurrences. 
Mr. CALLAWAY. I thank the gentle-
man. 
Mr. EDWARDS of Alabama. Mr. 
Speaker, will the gentleman yield? 
Mr. CALLAWAY. I am happy to yield 
to the gentleman from Alabama. 
Mr. EDWARDS of Alabama. Mr. 
Speaker, I should like to commend 
the gentleman from Georgia for a fine 
presentation today. What he said has 
been an inspiration to all of us. 
It is certainly refreshing to me 
to have the firsthand knowledge the gen-
tleman obtained on his trip to Vietnam. 
I also wish to commend the gentleman 
for paying his own way. In this day 
and time when we seem to spend the 
taxpayer's money like it is going out of 
style, this also is refreshing, to find a 
man interested enough in what is going 
on in the world to pay his own way to 
go over to find out for himself. 
I am sure the report the gentleman 
has brought back to the House will be of 
immeasurable value not only to Members 
of Congress but also to the Department 
of Defense. 
I thank the gentleman for presenting 
us this report. 
Mr. CALLAWAY. I thank the gen-
tleman for his kind remarks. 
Mr. LAIRD. Mr. Speaker, will the 
gentleman yield? 
Mr. CALLAWAY. I am happy to yield 
to the gentleman from Wisconsin, the 
distinguished conference chairman. 
Mr. LAIRD. I wish to concur in the 
remarks made by the gentleman from 
Alabama and the gentleman from 
Georgia in commending the gentleman 
on his fine report of his trip to Vietnam. 
I believe it calls to the attention of all 
Members of Congress the responsibility 
we have to examine carefully the posi-
tion of our Government in this area of 
the world. 
It is my hope that in the next few 
weeks we can have farther public dis-
cussions about the position we occupy 
in southeast Asia and the overall policy 
decisions which have been made. 
This afternoon we are reporting the 
defense appropriation bill from the Ap-
propriations Committee. Many of us on 
that committee are concerned about the 
inadequacy Of the budget which was sent 
to us for the Department of Defense, to 
cover the expenses of that Department 
in the fiscal year 1966. Time and again 
witnesses before the committee from the 
Department of Defense and from the 
three services indicated to us that the 
guidelines which were set forth for draw-
ing up this budget did not take into con-
sideration the escalation which has 
taken place in Vietnam after the Presi-
dent made his decision to go North, as 
far as the Air Force was concerned, in 
the latter part of calendar year 1965. 
We have already had one supplemental 
budget request totaling some $700 mil-
lion sent to the Congress, and I would 
predict that in January, or early in the 
next calendar year, we will have another 
supplemental request to cover the costs 
of the Vietnamese operation. 
It would seem to me that all of us in 
the Congress should be made aware of 
one fact: the budget which was sent to 
us supposedly was under $100 billion as 
far as estimated expenditures at the first 
of this year are concerned, and that 
budget showed a reduction in defense 
spending so that other domestic pro-
grams could be funded at a higher level 
without breaking through the $100 billion 
ceiling. Yet that budget did not take 
into consideration these increased Viet-
namese activities. They set a budget 
ceiling of $100 billion while at the same 
time they knew full well with the Viet-
namese operation going as it was that 
further requests would be made of this 
Congress in order to fund this particular 
operation. The highest priority as far 
as the expenditure of the taxpayer's dol-
lars today, is concerned is in the area 
of national security. The commitment 
that this country has made as far as 
southeast Asia is concerned and, yes, 
throughout the world in this area of na-
tional security should have the No. 1 
place as far as our Governmen is con-
cerned. 
Therefore I say, as we proceed down 
the line, we will find that this budget doc-
ument with the $100 billion ceiling, which 
was hailed all over the United States 
early in January, had no consideration 
given in it to the stepped-up activities 
which were already in the works at that 
partciular time. This is something that 
we should discuss and that the American 
people should be made fully aware of. 
I thank the gentleman from Georgia 
for yielding to me. 
Mr. CALLAWAY. Mr. Speaker, 
thank the gentleman for his contribu-
tion. 
I would like to say that I agree with the 
gentleman and, as one who has con-
sistently supported the President's policy 
in Vietnam, I certainly think that we 
should certainly watch carefully any-
thing this important to this Nation. 
Mr. ALBERT. Mr. Speaker, will the 
gentleman yield? 
Mr. CALLAWAY. I yield to the distin-
guished majority leader.

Mr. ALBERT. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to join my colleagues in commend-
ing the gentleman from Georgia for the 
very informative and comprehensive re-
port which he has given to ns. The gen-
tleman has done the House and the 
country a service in making this report 
on his brief but very fruitful visit to 
South Vietnam. 
Mr. CALLAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the distinguished gentleman for 
his kind remarks 
Mr. STRATTON. Mr. Speaker, will 
the gentleman yield to me? 
Mr. CALLAWAY. I yield to the gen-
tleman from New York. 
Ur. STRATTON. Mr. Speaker, I ap-
predate the gentleman yielding to me. 
I want to join, too, in commending the 
gentleman from Georgia, who has a great 
deal of personal knowledge and experi-
ence In the military field, on his com-
ments and for making his trip. I think 
we have all found his observations help-
ful. I was particularly impressed by the 
fact that, as he just remarked, his obser-
vations as he comes back do not differ 
very significantly from the established 
policy of our Government. He did rec-
ommend an extension of bombing to more 
military targets in the north, but at the 
same time, if I understand him cor-
rectly, he indicated that he recognized 
some Of the complexities that were in-
volved in making that kind of a decision. 
If the gentleman will yield further, I 
would like to ask him a question with 
respect to his first recommendation, 
which I did not understand entirely. If 
I understood the gentleman correctly, I 
understood him to say there was some 
distinction between the fight going on 
there now and the fight over the ulti-
mate political control of the territory. 
He suggested, if I understood him cor-
rectly, that in one area we should help 
the South Vietnamese, but in another 
area the fight should be left up to the 
Vietnainese themselves. I am afraid I 
do not quite understand that, because it 
seems to me basically these two struggles 
are the same, In fact, those who are now 
proposing that we pull out of Vietnam 
are the loudest in suggesting that what 
is going on there is really only a civil war 
and that we should leave that war to the 
Vietnamese themselves. I am sure the 
gentleman did not intend to subscribe to 
that point of view, but I wonder if he 
could make his point again, so that I 
might understand it more clearly. 
Mr. CALLAWAY. I thank the gentle-
man very much. 
First of all, I would like to say that he 
is entirely correct in that I do support 
the present policy in Vietnam. I had the 
opportunity to meet this morning with 
Secretary McNamara on that subject 
and we found ourselves almost in com-
plete agreement. 
You are correct that I have recom-
Mena4. 0914e farther actions in the 
north particularly bombing military tar-
gets, further than our administration is 
doing today. I feel that should be con-
sidercdhy our President. To that extent 
we have differences, perhaps, but in the 
main I support our effort in Vietnam and 
think it is _being handled extremely well 
and witch intter than press reports give 
us reaaoh to believe. 
I especially want to thank the gentle-
man for referring to my first recom-
mendation. I am sorry I did not make 
It clear, My intent was to state my con-
viction that there are two entirely dif-
ferent kinds of war that we may be called 
upon to fight in Vietnam. 
The first is the war against the Viet-
cong which we are fighting today, and 
which the Communists call a "war of 
liberation," It is my opinion that this 
can best be fought by the Army of the 
Republic of Vietnam, with the advice and 
help of our people, stressing the training 
for leadership, which is a long-range pro-
gram. 
In my opinion, we will be there a long 
time fighting this particular war against 
the Vietcong. 
Apparently, the main reason that we 
are sending in so many U.S.-commanded 
operational troops as I understand it, is 
to protect against the possibility of a 
great influx of operational troops from 
the enemy, be it North Vietnam, or who-
ever. This, to me, is a different kind of 
war which must be fought by our opera-
tional troops in order to be successful. 
I do not believe that the army of the 
Republic of Vietnam can. take care of 
that, We must fight it. So there are 
two different kinds of war. 
My recommendation was that if we 
continue to fight this Vietcong style of 
"war of liberation," that we pull out our 
operational troops or do not use them, 
but rather use the Vietnamese troops 
who are willing to do the fighting and 
that we provide them the training. 
Mr. STRATTON, Mr. Speaker, if the 
gentleman will yield further to me, would 
the gentleman not agree that what he 
refers to as the Vietcong war is also a 
war that has very largely been created 
by the infiltration of troops from out-
side South Vietnam? I wonder if the 
gentleman would not agree that what 
we are seeing in Vietnam is not really 
two different kinds of war, but rather the 
gradual extension of this initial Infiltra-
tion, with operations conducted entirely 
on a guerrilla basis, now moving to a 
point where these _same operations, 
though still conducted by the same Viet-
cong, who have actually infiltrated down 
from. the North, are beginning to resem-
ble a conventional, infantry-scale type 
of war? 
The gentleman is not suggesting, is he, 
that we would be willing to let this Viet-
cong operation be expanded to the point 
where South Vietnam itself might fall 
before such an attack? Do we not have 
an obligation to defeat this kind of in-
filtration, in whatever form it comes, so 
as to secure the liberation of South Viet-
nam, because for us to do anything less 
would be to negate our own commitment 
and let this vital area fall to the 
Communists? 
Mr. CALLAWAY'. I agree with the 
gentleman wholeheartedly. I would like 
to say that the Vietcong would fall and 
would have fallen long ago without sup-
port from Hanoi. So it is not a true civil 
war. It is totally financed, supported 
and instigated by North Vietnam. 
My distinction was perhaps a military 
one. I feel that as long as we are fight-
ing the Vietcom in this present situation 
where they attack and evaporate, use 
13475 
light weapons and use no trucks or air-
craft, then the Army of the Republic of 
Vietnam can and should handle the fight. 
But if we move into an area of conven-
tional war, with conventional frontlines, 
heavy 105-millimeter howitzers, trucks 
and tanks and aircraft and traditional 
frontline equipment, then I think we 
have a war that operational troops would 
have to fight. 
Mr. MAcGREGOR. Mr. Speaker, will 
the gentleman yield? 
Mr. CALLAWAY. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Minnesota. 
Mr. MAcGREGOR. Mr. Speaker, I 
commend the gentleman, particularly, as 
I understand it, from what the gentle-
man from Georgia [Mr. O'NEAL] said 
that the trip to Vietnam was made at his 
own personal expense; is that correct? 
Mr. CALLAWAY. That is correct. 
Mr. MAcGREGOR. May I ask the 
gentleman whether that was on a private 
commercial aircraft or was it on the basis 
of reimbursement for use of the Military 
Air Transport Service of the U.S. Gov-
ernment? 
Mr. CALLAWAY. It was on a regu-
larly operated commercially scheduled 
airline. You just buy a ticket as you 
would if you were to go to Chicago. 
Mr. MAcGREGOR. Does the gentle-
man have any idea how much more ex-
pensive it was to travel, as the gentleman 
from Georgia did, on a private commer-
cial carrier from Washington to Saigon 
as opposed to reimbursement on MATS 
on a space-available basis? 
Mr. CALLAWAY. I do not know the 
difference in cost. 
Mr. MAcGREGOR. It is fair to say, 
I am sure, that the cost of the gentle-
man's travel on a private commercial 
carrier was more expensive than it would 
be on a basis of reimbursement to the 
Government for a space-available seat. 
Mr. CALLAWAY. I feel certain it is. 
Mr. MAcGREGOR. If the gentleman 
will yield further, may I ask the gentle-
man whether or not any official in the 
Department of State or the Department 
of Defense or the Executive Office of the 
President extended to the gentleman the 
opportunity to ride on a space-available 
basis on MATS aircraft? 
Mr. CALLAWAY. No; they did not. 
Mr. RHODES of Arizona. Mr. Speak-
er, will the gentleman yield? 
Mr. CALLAWAY. I am glad to yield 
to the gentleman from Arizona. 
Mr. RHODES of Arizona. I want to 
congratulate the gentleman for having 
made his trip. I want to state that in 
November of 1964, as a member of the 
Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the 
Committee on Appropriations, I also 
went to Vietnam. At that time I was 
taken by helicopter to a small village 
which was surrounded by Vietcong ter-
ritory, I talked to the people who were 
the residents of the village. This was a 
village which had been overrun by the 
Vietcong about 3 weeks before we got 
there. You could still see the scars from 
the battle. In fact, almost all of the peo-
ple who survived had relatives who had 
been killed, wounded, or kidnaped at the 
time of the Vietcong attack. 
This, certainly, I am sure the gentle-
man will agree is a heart-rending sort 
of war. It is very difficult terrain. It is

hard for the people who are combatants, 
but it is harder for the people who are 
dependents of those who are lighting. 
Mr. Speaker, I know the gentleman 
joins me and I am sure the other Mem-
bers of the House hope that the end of 
this war will come more clearly in sight 
than it now appears to be, and that we 
will continue to do what is necessary as 
far as our national commitment is con-
cerned to the cause of the free world, 
and that we will be able to aid the South 
Vietnamese to bring this whole matter 
to a conclusion which will be a victorious 
one for the cause of freedom.. 
When I came back, I said that the 
prime need in Vietnam was for a stable 
civilian government to run this war. I 
still say so. I hope our Government will 
bend every effort to help such a govern-
ment to evolve. 
Mr. CALLAWAY. I think the gentle-
man from Arizona and I certainly agree 
with the gentleman. 
Mr. yeaGHAN. Mr. Speaker, will the 
gentleman yield? 
Mr. CALLAWAY. I shall be happy to 
yield to the gentleman from Ohio. 
Mr. FEIGHAN. I wish to commend 
my distinguished colleague from Georgia 
for the interest he has taken in the prob-
lems of Vietnam and I would like to 
ask the gentleman whether, while he was 
in Vietnam, he developed any evidence 
of the Communist Vietcong atrocities 
against U.S. servicemen, U.S. civilians in 
that area, and against the South Viet-
namese servicemen or civilians including 
women and children? 
Mr. CALLAWAY. I would like to say 
to the gentleman from Ohio that I did 
not develop any evidence on this. I, of 
course, saw where the Embassy was 
bombed in Saigon shortly before I was 
there. But I did talk to people who in-
dicated that there were terrible atrocities, 
not only to village chiefs and people who 
might have some reason to be treated 
this way, but even brutal atrocities to 
women and children for no reason what-
soever. 
I did not see this myself but I had 
reason to believe it is true. 
Mr. FE1GHAN. If the gentleman will 
yield further, that is a matter I believe 
of deep concern to the people of the 
United States and the free world and 
I am very glad that under the leadership 
of our very able chairman of the Com-
mittee on Armed Services, the gentleman 
from South Carolina [Mr. RIVERS], that 
committee is going to make a full in-
vestigation and present, as they should, 
this evidence to the people of the United 
States. 
Mr. CALLAWAY. I thank the gen-
tleman from Ohio. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to say just 
one word further on the atrocities that 
are taking place all the time. In those 
areas in which the people show loyalty 
to us, children are actually kidnaped 
from their mothers and fathers, and en-
listed into the Vietcong to fight their 
countrymen against their wills. 
Mr. PICKLE. Mr. Speaker, will the 
gentleman yield? 
Mr. CALLAWAY. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas. 
Mr. PICKLE. I would like to join my 
colleagues in commending the gentleman 
from Georgia for this trip and for this 
very fair and factual report which the 
gentleman has given to the Members of 
the House today. 
Mr. Speaker, I listened with a great 
deal of interest to the report and I have 
profited from it, as I am sure all Mem-
bers on both sides of the aisle have 
profited from it. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to state that, 
of course, the recommendations which 
the gentleman has made are his indi-
vidual recommendations, but I believe 
the gentleman has given us a better in-
sight as to the problem which exists in 
Vietnam. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the 
gentleman for his report. 
Mr. CALLAWAY. I thank the gen-
tleman from Texas. 
Mr. MIZE. Mr. Speaker, will the gen-
tleman yield? 
Mr. CALLAWAY. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Kansas. 
Mr. MIZE. I want to join my col-
leagues in complimenting the gentleman 
for this fine report. 
I want to get it clear with reference 
to the morale of our troops which the 
gentleman states is high, is that correct? 
Mr. CALLAWAY. It is not only high, 
but it is in the opinion of every single 
commander that I asked, higher than 
they have ever seen it in any other war. 
Mr. MIZE. I thank the gentleman. 
Mr. CALLAWAY. I would like to 
thank the gentleman from Kansas for 
bringing this out because I do not think 
we get the feel of that from the press. 
May I say that I talked to a young cap-
tain who had been up fighting all night. 
He was tired, and bearded, his radio was 
strapped on his back, and he was covered 
with mud. I asked him, "How do you 
like it out here?" And his first word was 
"Great." 
Mr. YOUNGER. Mr. Speaker, will the 
gentleman yield? 
Mr. CALLAWAY. I yield to the -gen-
tleman from California. 
Mr. YOUNGER. I would like to Join 
with my colleagues in thanking the gen-
tleman for making this trip and giving 
such a fine report of it. I am not sure 
all of the Members realize that the man 
in the well is also a graduate of West 
Point, so that he is giving us from his 
training and his experience something 
that we rarely get here on the floor. 
I thank the gentleman very much. 
Mr. CALLAWAY. I thank the gentle-
man for his kind words. I do not pre-
tend to be an expert on this. But I do 
recommend to my colleagues that they 
go to Vietnam; I think that those able 
to make the trip will profit greatly. 
I would like to stress again that our 
morale is high. Both the Vietnamese 
and the Americans feel they are doing 
an important job and I feel they are do-
ing it well. 
WE NEED A TECHNOLOGICAL 
BREAKTHROUGH IN URBAN MASS 
TRANSPORT, NOT JUST BE'ri'Elt 
INTERCITY RAIL TRANSPORT 
The SPEAKER. Under previous order 
of the House, the gentleman from Wis-
consin [Mr. REuss] is recognized for 30 
minutes. 
Mr. REUSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to-
day to remind my colleagues of the very 
serious state of transportation in our 
Nation's cities. 
Soon we will be asked to approve a $20 
million research and demonstration pro-
gram to design a new high-speed inter-
city ground transportation system along 
the Washington-Boston, or northeast 
corridor. This program will be focused 
on travel between cities despite the 
greater demand which exists for good 
public transportation systems within the 
cities themselves. 
As a cure for the intraurban trans-
portation problem, we are instead rely-
ing on the Mass Transit Act of 1964. But 
this act can do little more than help 
cities purchase new buses or replace 
wornout subway cars. No substantial re-
search is being sponsored by the Federal 
Government in an attempt to develop 
new. dynamic- systems which will provide 
urban dwellers with good public trans-
port. 
We should be spending at least as much 
on research to provide whole new systems 
of moving people about within our cities 
rapidly, safely, economically, and effi-
ciently, as we are on research into other 
modes of transportation. 
It is rather like concentrating all one's 
efforts on saving the dying dogwood 
tree?beautiful as it is?and neglecting 
the withering oak which provides the 
real strength of our forests. We should 
be working to save both. 
Today, nearly. three-quarters of our 
population lives in urban areas. All of 
these people must move about in the cities 
in which they live. They need quick, 
economical, and sate ways to get to work, 
to shop, and to visit. They cannot for-
ever depend on existing transportation 
systems. Therefore, it is the responsibil-
ity of our Government to promote the 
development of systems which will sup-
plement existing methods. 
In view of this need, I am today in-
troducing H.R. 9200 to amend the Mass 
Transit Act of 1964. The measure would 
require the Administrator of the Hous-
ing and Home Finance Agency to under-
take a research program aimed at achiev-
ing a technological breakthrough in the 
development of new modes of urban 
transportation.

LEY]; the gentleman from Texas [Mr. 
CABELL], the gentleman from New York 
[Mr. MuvrER], the gentleman from New 
York [Mr. RosENTHAL], the gentlewoman 
from Missouri [Mrs. SuLtrvAH], the gen-
tleman from Ohio [Mr. VAEnc], the gen-
tleman from Georgia [Mr. WELTNERL 
and the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. 
YATES] are introducing identical bills. 
The text of H.R. 9200 follows: 
Re it enacted by the Senate and the House 
of Representatives of the United States of 
America in Congress assembled, That section 
6 of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 
1964 is amended by redesignating subsection 
(c) as subsection (d), and by inserting after 
subsection (b) the following new subsection: 
"(c) In addition to projects undertaken

The OAS even has persuaded the leaders of 
the military junta to promise that none of 
them will run in the elections. 
Both sides in the civil war probably will 
continue to drag their heels whenever they 
can, but firm action by the OAS gradually 
will overcome that handicap. At the mo-
ment, even though the situation remains 
serious and difficult, the prospects are 
brighter than might have been expected a 
few days ago when confusion Was in com-
mand. 
For this, on reflection, we can thank the 
original decisiveness of President Johnson 
in sending U S. troops -which undoubtedly 
prevented an even worse slaughter of

and persistence of Mora and his OAS as-
sociates in negotiating the understandings

THE WASHINGTON, D.C., MEETING 
ON OCEAN SCIENCE AND OCEAN 
ENGINEERING 
Mr. PFIJ,, Mr. President, a most out-
standing 4-day meeting has just con-
cluded here in Washington. The meet-
ing was remarkable for two reasons: 
first, it was concrete evidence of a great 
surge of activity in a field of primary 
Importance for all Americans: and, sec-
ond, because in spite of its significance. 
It passed almost unnoticed. 
The meeting was on the subject of 
ocean science and ocean engineering, 
with dual sponsorship by the Marine 
Technology Society and the American 
Society of Limnology and Oceanography. 
The Marine Teclinoloey Society is 
new?less than a year old. Its remark-
able growth and achievement in less 
than a year are a tribute to les officers 
and directors, but?even more imp. o-
tant?also to the fact that it has filled 
an Important void in national organiza-
tion, by providing an organization and 
forum for those who are concerned, not 
solely with obtaining knowledge from 
the seas, but with putting that knowl-
edge to use in practical engineering 
terms. 
The American Society of Limnoloary 
and Oceanography has a longer, but 
equally successful, history. and is de-
voted to the advancement of science in 
these fields.. Perhaps some Senators 
find "limnology" a new word, as I did. 
It Is perhaps most conveniently de-
fined by simply stating that a linanologist 
is to..fresh water what an oceanographer 
is to salt water. 
The chairman of the joint conference 
was the distinguished former Assistant 
Secretary of the Navy for Research and 
Development, and chairman of the In-
teragency Committee on Oceanography, 
Dr. James 'H. Wakelin, Jr., now president 
of the Scientific Engineering Institute. 
The meeting was significant because 
It provided a meeting ground for scien-
tists, engineers, and managers from the 
academic world, from private industry, 
and from Government. The subjects 
ranged from detailed studies of a single 
aspect of science or technology, such its 
"Variability in Marine Benthic Com-
munities off Georgia" and "A Free Div-
ing Oceanography 13uoy:" to broad tappics, 
ranging from an assessment of mineral 
resources of the sea to a full day's dis-
cussion of the role of nuclear energy

that the Vietcong are a purely idealistic 
movement, not living on fear and terror-
ism. 
I ask unanimous consent that an edi-
torial on these two speeches by the Vice 
President, published in the Baltimore 
Sun on Monday, June 7, 1965, be printed 
at this point in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the editorial 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
Tsaaoaism 
Vice President IlumpHREY suggested last 
week, in a speech at the National War College, 
that liberals and conservatives should modify 
their traditional positions on the use of mili-
tary power to help weak or struggling nations 
to defend their independence against Com-
munist subversion and attack. "Liberals," 
he said, "raliSt learn that there are times 
when American power must be used, and 
that there is no substitute for power in the 
face of a determined terrorist attack. Con-
servatives must learn that in defeating a 
Communist insurgency the use of military 
power can be counterproductive without ac-
companying political effort and the credible 
promise to the people of a better life." 
The Vice President was emphasizing, as he 
said, that Communist terrorism cannot be 
defeated "by good works alone, or by good 
Intentions, or by slogans, or by propaganda 
alone." He said further that Americans must 
learn to be patient?"the Communists are 
very patient"?and must learn to persist, 
because the Communists are persistent, too. 
"We must learn to adapt our military 
planning and tactics to the new conditions 
of Communist warwaxe," Mr. HIIMPHRE 
added, and we must learn to coordinate 
Military efforts, propaganda, effective politi-
Cal organizational efforts and economic in-
vestments far better than we have done so 
In another speech last week, made at Michi-
gan State University, the Vice President dealt 
with what he called the "curious misconcep-
tion" that in Vietnam the Vietcong is a 
great idealistic movement with some resem-
blance, for example, to the American Popu-
list Party. In fact, however, he said the 
Vietcong has made its gains in South Viet-
nam largely from terrorism. Arthur Schles-
inger, whose own qualifications as an Ameri-
can liberal are as authentic as Mr. HUM-
PHREY'S, said the Vietcong's gains "have come 
in the main not from the hopes they have 
inspired but from the fear they have created." 
Agricultural stations hate been destroyed, 
medical clinics raided, malaria control teams 
killed or kidnaped. Since 1954, according to 
estimates cited by Mr. HuMPHREY, more than 
10,000 civilian officials have been killed or 
kidnaped. 
These comments on the war in Vietnam 
are worth keeping in mind as the news dis-
patches describe the fighting and as the dis-
cussion of our policy continues in the United 
States. 
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, an edi-
torial entitled "The Great Paradox," 
published in the New York Herald Tri-
bune on June 6, paints up some of the 
facts of our changing world concerning 
our relationship with the Soviet Union 
arid Red China. I ask unanimous con-
sent that this editorial be printed at this 
Paint .,in the RECORD. 
Thexe 'being no objection the editorial 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
THE GREAT PARADOX 
President Johnson calls on the Soviet 
Union to join the 'United States in works of 
peace, while evidence accumulates that Rus-
sian guns and planes are moving into North 
Vietnam, The Soviet Union complains that 
Johnson talks peace while bombing a Com-
munist country. 
The situation is paradoxical. But the 
contradictory elements in the two national 
positions are real. There is no reason to 
doubt that both Washington and Moscow 
would prefer more stable relations with one 
another?and there is equally no reason to 
question the reality of the clash in Vietnam. 
The United States is deeply committed there; 
so is the Soviet Union. Americans had 
hoped that the Russians would use their in-
fluence to end the intervention of the North 
Vietnamese in South Vietnam; Russians 
want the Americans to pull out. 
Vietnam is not the only corner of the 
earth in which American and Soviet interests 
clash, nor does either nation make any par-
ticular secret of the fact that the Russians 
want communism to spread and the Ameri-
cans want it to roll back. But what was 
once a worldwide confrontation, with 
dangers of overt hostility at every point on 
the periphery of Communist power, has 
altered profoundly. Much of the frontier 
symbolized by the Iron Curtain has been 
stabilized; the curtain itself has been per-
forated in spots, with trade and communica-
tion barriers lowered. Berlin and Cuba are 
peril points, but even there the dangers are 
likely to spring more from the ambitions of 
Castro or the fears of the East German 
Communists than from the Soviet leader-
ship. 
This lessening of many acute tensions 
could lead, not to a firm peace (for the 
political and economic systems of East and 
West are still too far apart for that) but 
to a kind of modus vivendi, an agreement to 
disagree, that would permit a far more nor-
mal life for both superpowers, as well as 
for the nations that live in their neighbor-
hood. 'But?there is also Red China. 
Mao's China is all that the Soviet Union 
was in the days when Stalin ruled over a na-
tion, victorious in war but gravely damaged 
by it Peiping has ninny material wants, 
plus the consciousness of having survived 
a great ordeal, proud, secretive, suspicious, 
aggressive. It proclaims permanent revolu-
tion, expands its einpire, and adds to this ex-
plosive mixture a racialist aspect that finds 
appreciative echoes in many of the new 
nations. 
To this hungry predator, the Soviet 
Union?whose people are intensely desirous 
of enjoying the fruits of their own long and 
bloody struggle?is linked by ideological ties. 
The fact that Red China has made the 
United States its great foe, the symbol of all 
that is evil in the world, the enemy against 
which it unites its people virtually from the 
cradle, is Moscow's prime embarrassment in 
seeking any accommodation on any subject 
with Washington. 
The Soviet leadership hopes to avoid a 
choice; it would like the United States, by 
bowing out of Vietnam, to make one unneces-
sary. But even that would not solve the 
Moscow-Peiping problem. For sooner or 
later the choice will be forced on Moscow?
perhaps not over Vietnam, possibly not over 
any matter in which the United States is 
directly concerned. Because it is really 
Russia, not America, that China is contend-
ing with even now. 
THE WHITE HOUSE FESTIVAL OF 
THE ARTS, AND THE NATIONAL 
FOUNDATION ON THE ARTS _AND 
THE HUMANITIES ACT OF 1965 
Mr. FELL. Mr. President, thanks to 
the leadership and understanding of 
President and Mrs. Lyndon B. Johnson, 
June 14, 1965, was a day deeply signifi-
cant to our Nation's cultural progress 
and growth. On that day, the White 
House festival of the arts was held. It 
was a festival of unprecedented scope, 
and demonstrated not only the great va-
riety of our country's artistic talent, but 
also this administration's desire to help 
foster, in every appropriate way, excel-
lence in the arts. 
The program was most comprehensive, 
and gave fitting emphasis to the broad 
spectrum of the arts: poetry, prose, 
drama, dance, mulc?both instrumental 
and vocal?painting, sculpture, photog-
raphy, and the arts of the motion pic-
tures. 
Mrs. Johnson was a particularly gra-
cious hostess to the more than 400 
guests; and in her opening remarks she 
set the tone for this remarkable event 
when she called it a day of feasting for 
the eyes, ears, and minds of those who 
participated. 
As the President said in his address 
of welcome to the artists assembled: 
You seek out the common pleasures and 
visions, terrors, and cruelties of man's day 
on this planet. You help dissolve the bar-
riers of hatred and ignorance which are the 
source of so much pain and danger. In this 
way you work toward peace which liberates 
man to reach for the finest fulfillment of 
his spirit. 
Other great American Presidents have 
spoken eloquent words 'in behalf of our 
Nation's artists; but this was an occa-
sion of unusual depth and magnitude, 
representing our past achievements in 
the arts, as well as contemporary works 
of importance. 
As chairman of the Senate Special 
Subcommittee on Arts and Humanities, 
I pay special tribute to the President and 
to Mrs. Johnson for so splendidly bring-
ing to the White House the wide diver-
sity of our creative talents; and I am 
very happy to note that just 4 days be-
fore the festival, the Senate passed the 
National Foundation on the Arts and the 
Humanities Act of 1965. 
This bill contains the President's pro-
posals for the Foundation. As I have 
said before, I believe the bill is the most 
comprehensive of its kind ever to come 
before Congress. Thus, the concepts of 
the festival and those of the Foundation 
are in close and meaningful harmony. 
Bath are, indeed, unique in the history of 
our country.

sentatives, by Mr. Hackney, one of its

EXCISE TAX REDUCTION ACT, OF 
1965?CONFERENCE REPORT 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. Mr. Presi-
dent,_
I submit a report of the committee 
of conference on the disagreeing votes of 
the two Houses on the amendments of 
the Senate to the bill (H.R. 8371) to 
reduce excise taxes, and fog other pur-
poses. I ask unanimous consent for the 
present consideration  of  the report. 
The PRESIDING Ores.CER (Mr. FELL 
In the chair). The report will be read 
for the information of the Senate. 
The legislative clerk read the report. 
(For conference report, see House pro-
ceedings of June 16, 1965, pp. 13354-
13355, CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.) 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the present consideration of 
the report? 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the report. 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. Mr. Presi-
dent, I have the honor to bring before 
the Senate the conference report on H.R. 
8371, the Excise Tax Reduction Act of 
1965. 
This is the bill that only the day be-
fore yesterday was passed by the Senate. 
I think you can see from this that the 
conferees acted with expedition. In fact 
I might take time to point out that the 
whole handling of this bill, I believe, sets 
some kind of a record for quick action. 
It was exactly 1 month ago today, on 
May 17, that the President first sent to 
Congress his recommendations for excise 
tax reductions. 
This is an indication of the speed with 
which Congress can act on tax legisla-
tion when there is a need to do so. All 
oL us were aware of the fact that any 
delay in action on our part might affect 
the economy through the delay of pur-
chases of the taxed articles by consum-
erS. In my view, this demonstrates, and 
demonstrates quite clearly, that when 
there is general agreement in Congress 
that a tax reduction is needed, this ac-
tion can be taken?in the regular legis-
lative manner In a very short period of 
time. 
The bill, as agreed to by the conferees, 
does not depart to any appreciable ex-
tent from the bill as passed by the Sen-
ate the day before yesterday. This is 
Indicated by the fact that the bill as 
Initially passed by the Senate would, over 
a 4-year period, have reduced excise tax 
collections by $4,658 million. The bill, 
as agreed to by the conferees, is a reduc-
tion of $4,676 million which con,stitutes 
a difference of only $18 million from the 
bill passed by the Senate 2 days ago. 
Actually, there are 108 numbered 
amendments in this bill. However, most 
of these are in the clarifying or con-
forming categories. In terms of sub-
stantive amendments, I count 29 amend-
ments. However, of these, eight repre-
sent minor technical amendments recom-
mended by the Treasury staff and our 
own technical tax staff. Apart from 
these, of the remaining 21, the conferees 
for the House receded on 13, 3 with sig-
nificant amendments. The Senate con-
ferees receded on eight. 
Of all of the amendments. I would 
classify five as the most significant. 
Two of these dealt with the manu-
facturers' excise tax on automobiles. As 
Senators will recall, the bill reduces this 
tax to 7 percent this month and then to 
6 percent on next January 1. On Jan-
uary 1, 1967, the Senate version of the 
bill would reduce the tax to 5 percent 
and then on the following two January 
l's, 1968 and 1969, there would be two 
additional reductions of 2 percentage 
points. Thus, the Senate would retain 
a tax of 1 percent at all times. The 
House would remove this tax entirely. 
This 1 percentage point under the Sen-
ate version of the bill would be set aside 
by the Senate bill in a special fund to 
aid in the disposal of old and wrecked 
automobiles. 
In addition, 4 percentage points of the 
reduction in the tax on passenger cars 
was made contingent, in the Senate ver-
sion of the bill, by the Ribicoff amend-
ment, upon cars meeting the same safety 
standards as are required by the Gen-
eral Services Administration with re-
spect to cars purchased by the Federal 
Government. 
The House conferees, although we 
urged them earnestly to accept the 
amendment relating to car safety, re-
fused to do so. 
The conferees debated the amend-
ment for more than an hour. We did 
not agree. We took a recess and then 
debated it again. We proposed a com-
promise. However, the House was abso-
lutely adamant on this amendment. 
They made it clear that in resisting 
this amendment they were not opposing 
these standards of car safety as such, 
but rather objected to their being made a 
condition to a tax reduction. They 
seemed to believe that if action was 
taken in this respect, it should be taken 
directly by the House Committee on In-
terstate and Foreign Commerce and the 
Senate Committee on Commerce. For 
that reason we had accede to the House 
In this regard. 
With respect to the 1 percentage 
point set aside for old and wrecked auto-
mobiles, the House agree to retain this 
1 percentage point of tax. They re-
fused, however, to earmark it in a fund 
for the disposal of old and wrecked 
automobiles. This, of course, does not 
mean that this 1 percentage point?or, 
for that matter, the other 4 points 
not to be repealed until after 1967?can-
not be used to meet problems raised by 
automobiles. This amount, for the pres-
ent, will remain in the general fund 
revenue. This, of course, will not at 
some future time foreclose the allocation 
of this amount to the problems raised 
by automobiles, whether for safety, for 
the disposal of old cars, or other problems 
related to automobiles. 
It will be recalled that the Senate ver-
sion of the bill moved up the effective 
date for the reductions which, under the 
House bill, were scheduled for July 1, 
1965. The Senate version of the bill pro-
vided that all of the retailers' taxes which 
are repealed, all of the manufacturers' 
taxes scheduled for repeal or reduction 
on July 1. and the playing card tax, in-
stead of being repealed on July 1, are to 
be repealed on the day after the day the 
bill is signed by the President. The 
House agreed to this amendment and, 
therefore, the effective dates of these re-
ductions will be the day after the bill is 
signed. I believe it is clear that this bill 
will be presented for signature to the 
President within the next few days. 
Mr. President, I am somewhat embar-
rassed by a report that appears in the 
press. I am not certain whether the 
reporter who reported the statement 
heard it accurately. He said that the 
Senator from Louisiana said that the 
President would sign the bill on Friday. 
As a practical matter, a suggestion had 
been made by the executive branch that 
the conferees should undertake to tell the 
President when he should sign the bill. 
The conferees unanimously agreed that 
It was none of our business to tell the 
President when he should sign the bill. 
That is his privilege. [Laughter.] He 
does not even have to sign it; he can veto 
It if he wishes to do so. That is purely 
a matter within his discretion. But, 
somehow the press misunderstood the 
junior Senator from Louisiana. All I 
said was that if the President wanted 
to do so, he could sign the bill on Friday. 
I hope that that will straighten out the 
problem, because it has caused some mis-
understanding between the executive and 
legislative branches of the Government. 
I call the attention of the retail and 
wholesale trades to the fact that these 
reductions are about to occur and that 
if they hope to obtain floor stock refunds 
for their inventories on hand on the tax 
elimination date, they must be prepared 
to take these inventories as soon as the 
President signs the bill. 
That is perhaps the reason why the 
President might delay signing the bill 
for a few days, in order to give retailers 
a chance to take inventory. It would be 
fine with this Senator if the President 
were to sign the bill on Friday so that 
the tax cut would go into effect on Satur-
day. In that way, everyone selling cuff 
links, cologne, men's perfume, or tele-
vision sets could advertise, "Buy a televi-
sion set for daddy on Father's Day." 
[Laughter.] 
It would seem to me that would be a 
fine way to do it and to stop the buyer's 
strike. .However, that is up to the Presi-
dent. One way would favor the retailer 
and the other way would favor the kids. 
The President will make that decision.

by the Senate related to the tax on lubri-
cating oil. The Senate bill would have

Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I 
yield to the distinguished junior Sena-
tor from South Dakota such time as he 
may wish. 
Mr. McGOVERN. I thank the Sena-
tor from n Oklaho 
AM 
Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President I be-
lieve that the war in Vietnam has taken 
a dangerous new turn with the commit-
ment of large American land forces to a 
combat mission. Seventy-five thousand 
American soldiers are now committed to 
Vietnam and every indication points to 
a total of at least 100,000 by next WI. 
This in itself is a highly dangerous 
development for it will inevitably invite 
a greater commitment of forces by the 
other side. The large North Vietnamese 
array which has thus far remained 
largely on the sidelines may be increas-
ingly drawn into the fighting in the 
south. If that should happen on a 
large scale, it is clear that we would either 
be required to send in an arfriy of several 
hundred thousand men or face a dis-
astrous defeat or bloody stalemate out of 
all proportion to our interest in this 
corner of the globe. Nor does this 
prospect rule out the possibility of a con-
frontation with the huge armies of 
China backed by Russian air power and 
modern military equipment. 
Mr. President, let us be clear on one 
point before we take this course. Our 
present commitment of U.S. combat 
forces on a sizable scale in South Viet-
nam is a radical departure from the ad-
visory and assistance role which has 
heretofore been enunciated by Presidents 
Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson and 
by Secretary of Defense McNamara. 
In his original statement of U.S. aid 
to South Vietnam, President Eisen-
hower said on October 23, 1954: 
The purpose of this offer is to assist the 
Government of Vietnam in developing and 
maintaining a strong, viable state, capable 
of resisting attempted subversion or aggres-
sion through military means. The Govern-
ment of the United States expects that this 
aid will be met by performance on the part 
of the Government of Vietnam in undertak-
ing needed reforms. 
On September 2,1963, President Ken-
nedy said: 
I don't think that unless a greater effort 
Is made by the Government to win popular 
support that the war can be won out there. 
In the final analysis, it is their war. They 
are the ones who have to win or lose it. We 
can help them, we can give them equipment, 
we can send our men out there as advisers, 
but they have to win it?the people of Viet-
nam?against the Communists. We are pre-
pared to continue to assist them, but I don't 
think that the war can be won unless the 
people support the effort. 
On August 12, 1964, President Johnson 
said: 
The South Vietnamese have the basic re-
sponsibility for the defense of their own 
freedom. 
In February 1964, Secretary of De-
fense McNamara told congressional com-
mittees: 
I think we must recognize that success in 
the counterinsurgency campaign in South 
Vietnam depends primarily upon the South 
Vietnamese themselves. It depends upon 
their ability to construct a stable govern-
ment. It depends upon their willingness 
to fight. It depends upon the competency 
with which they are led. It depends upon 
the extent to which their government de-
serves and receives the loyalty of the people, 
and the support of the people. All of these 
conditions are conditions that additional men 
and equipment from the United States are 
not likely to advance. 
These statements make it perfectly 
clear that we did not go into southeast 
Asia to fight a major war with American 
forces. We are now following a course 
which is sharply at variance with the ad-
visory and supporting role previously 
spelled out by three Presidents. 
Yet, dangerous as this prospect is, an 
even more foolish course is now emerging 
as the recommendation of certain Re-
publican spokesmen who seem to be can-
ing for victory over the Vietcong guer-
rillas by massive U.S. bombing attacks 
on China and North Vietnam. 
Mr. President, how long will it take for 
some people to realize that bombing 
Hanoi or Peiping will have little or no 
effect on the guerrilla forces fighting a 
thousand miles away in the Jungles 
around Saigon? These guerrillas have 
lived for 20 years largely off the country-
side. They have fought largely with 
captured weapons. Their strength is 
that they are a part of the people and 
the terrain in which they fight. They 
live with the villagers and the peasants 
and in many cases are farmers by day 
and fighters by night. To bomb them is 
to bomb the women and children, the vil-
lagers and the peasants with whom they 
are intermingled. To destroy their crops 
and jungle foliage is to destroy the coun-
tryside on which the general population 
depends. Thus, our bombing attacks 
turn the people against us and feed the 
fires of rebellion that strengthen the 
guerrilla cause. 
In a recent U.S. bombing attack aimed 
at the guerrillas, newsmen reported that 
three out of four people seeking treat-
ment after the raid for the cruel burns 
of napalm bombs were village women 
and children. 
How much more ineffective it would 
be to start dropping bombs on the 
masses of humanity piled up in the cities 
of North Vietnam and China. This 
would not slow down the Vietnamese 
rebel forces thousands of miles to the 
south. It would simply destroy the moral 
and political influence of the United 
States in Asia. It would turn Asia into 
a seething sea of hatred against 
America from which we might never re-
cover. It could insure a Communist 
takeover in southeast Asia and perhaps 
all of Asia and the utter collapse of 
American influence in that part of the 
world. 
Instead of this futile course, I would 
urge that we take advantage of the forth-
coming Afro-Asian Conference in Algiers 
to encourage discussions with the Viet-
cong leaders in South Vietnam. Perhaps 
the Algerian hosts of this Conference 
could provide a useful contact with the 
National Liberation Front that speaks 
for the Vietcong. President Johnson has 
very wisely offered to enter into nego-
tiations leading to an honorable settle-
ment of the war without preconditions. 
The administration has, however, ex-
cluded the Vietcong from such negotia-
tions. That exclusion may be unwise and 
may be the chief barrier to negotiations. 
After all, the principal antagonists in 
this struggle are the government in Sai-
gon which remains in power with U.S. 
backing, and the Vietcong rebel forces 
which enjoy the support of Hanoi and 
Peiping. For us to insist that only Hanoi 
and Peiping can negotiate for the Viet-
cong is to presume a Communist mono-
lithic bloc in southeast Asia that may be 
a creature of our own misconceptions. 
Nor do we have any claim to be the 
principal negotiator for South Vietnam. 
That Is the function of Saigon. I some-
times think that the Government and 
the people of South Vietnam have been 
lost sight of in this strange and tragic 
war. 
In any event, to refuse to include the 
National Liberation Front of the rebel 
forces in negotiations would be similar 
to King George III insisting 185 years 
ago that he would negotiate with our 
French ally but not with Gen. George 
Washington and his rebel American 
forces.

June 17, 1965 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 13541 
I am told that the administration ob-
jects to discussions with the Vietcong 
because this might undermine the South 
Vietnamese government. But govern-
ments have been falling in Saigon with 
regularity every few weeks for the past 
2 years, Furthermore, the government 
In Saigon has repeatedly expressed the 
fear that the United States is taking 
over the war so completely that it has 
the effect of undercutting the Saigon 
government in the eyes of its people. 
If we are concerned about discussions 
with the Vietcong undermining the 
South Vietnamese Government and I 
, think that is a legitimate concern?
there are two safeguards we could fol-
low. First, we could encourage the 
South Vietnamese Government to initi-
ate such cliscnssions with the Vietcong, 
or second, we could and should give as-
surances to Saigon that any negotiations 
in which we are involved will be in co-
operation with our South Vietnamese 
ally. 
As one respected American editor put 
it: 
The administration's mistake hitherto has 
been to point to a door marked "uncondi-
tional discussion," which has also been 
marked, "no admittance for the Vietcong," 
thus inhibiting a response from any quarter. 
To take down that inhibiting sign calls 
for political courage by President Johnson?
almost as much as was displayed by General 
de Gaulle when he proposed entering into 
peace talks with the Algerians. But the 
alternatives now seem reduced to two: 
American withdrawal without parley as de-
manded by Peiping and Hanoi, or the com-
mitment to South Vietnam of several 
fighting divisions which will bear the brunt 
of 5 or 10 more years of jungle war. 
Mr. President, before we drift or plunge 
into either of these unfortunate alter-
natives, I hope and pray that the Senate 
will engage in long and painstaking de-
bate about the essentials of our present 
foreign policy. to we intend to rush 
Into every revolutionary situation in the 
world on the theory that we have a man-
date to impose an American solution? 
Do we intend to work with or against 
the powerful nationalistic and social 
forces now convulsing Asia, Africa, and 
Latin America? Do we assume that all 
Communist or Socialist states are "one 
ball of wax- and that we must resist 
them all down to the last American sol-
dier, or can we live in peace with "Tito-
1st" type regimes, including, perhaps, 
even Ho Chi Minh? Will we forever in-
sist on denying the existence of a gov-
ernment on mainland China?the most 
populous nation in the world? What is 
the role of the United Nations and oth-
er peacek6eping agencies in the trouble-
spots of the world? How effective is mil-
itary power in areas of overriding hu-
man misery, hunger, and disease? Do we 
understand the aources of Communist 
appeal to the neglected peoples of the 
world? 4cre we using our own strongest 
moral, political, and economic weapons 
including Our food and technical know-
how to the best advantage in our com-
petition with the Communists? Is south-
east Asia so vital to our interests that 
it is sufficient cause for us to undertake 
world war4 III in that part of the globe? 
110--11 
These are some of the many questions 
that I hope the Senate will debate be-
fore we are committed so irrevocably to 
a course in southeast Asia that all de-
bate and discussion is stilled by march-
ing feet and exploding bombs. 
Mr. President, I add one final thought: 
Recent announcements that U.S. forces 
will engage in ground combat in Vietnam 
if requested by the Government of South 
Vietnam, comes at a particularly bad 
moment because of the continuing in-
ability of that Government to get a grill 
on the situation. 
If it were a question of the United 
States responding to a request for help 
from a government which was moving to-
ward stability and control, that would be 
one thing. But the political standing of 
the Government of South Vietnam has 
grown weaker rather than stronger in 
recent weeks. 
It is ironic that one newspaper--the 
New York Times?care d the story of the 
U.S. decision to allow 1.. 3. troops to fight 
at the request of the South Vietnamese 
Government right next to a story about 
the expected fall of the South Viet-
namese Government. This juxtaposition 
reemphasizes the fact that the problem 
in South Vietnam is first and foremost 
a political one. Military measures are 
also necessary at this time, but until a 
satisfactory political solution is reached 
in South Vietnam, military measures 
alone?bombings of North Vietnam, in-
creased numbers of U.S, advisers, more 
modern equipment, or actual combat by 
U.S. troops?will not solve the problem. 
There is a great contrast between the 
direction of U.S. policy in Latin America 
and in Asia. In the Dominican Republic, 
for instance, what began as a unilateral 
intervention is becoming more and more 
multinational and the responsibility of 
the Organization of American States. 
Yet, in South Vietnam, what began as a 
multinational enforcement of Geneva 
commitments is becoming more and more 
a unilateral intervention, in which even 
the South Vietnamese Government is 
playing a smaller role while the U.S. role 
continues to escalate. 
I think we would be wise in Asia, as 
well as in Latin America, to avoid uni-
lateral intervention and to work for 
multilateral support for our efforts. If it 
is impossible to get effective multilateral 
backing, I think that should be a clue to 
us that our policies and objectives may 
need reevaluation. 
Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished Sen-
ator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I com-
mend the Senator from South Dakota 
for his very thoughtful speech. I was 
not able to be present throughout the 
entire speech. I did not have the op-
portunity to read the speech prior to its 
delivery. Therefore, I am not prepared 
to say whether I agree with everything 
that was said. I believe that the speech 
was an extremely thoughtful contribu-
tion to the dialog on this very serious 
situation confronting us in southeast 
Asia. 
All too frequently lately, I have noticed 
- , , ? 
that the columnists, editorial writers, 
radio and TV commentators keep insist-
ing that any discussion of our involve-
ment in southeast Asia will somehow 
or other be misunderstood over there, 
and, therefore, we should not talk too 
much about it over here. 
My comment about that is that I do 
not believe that we should qualify our 
freedom and our freedom of speech in 
this country based upon what might be 
thought by people who never had any 
freedom or freedom of speech. 
We should not give up our freedom or 
our freedom of speech in this country 
merely because they do not understand 
what it is about since they have never 
experienced it. 
I commend the Senator for a thought-
ful and courageous contribution to this 
dialog, which should continue in a free 
society such as the one in which we live 
and hope to continue to live for all time 
to come. 
APPOINTMENT OF GEN. WILLIAM F. 
McKEE TO THE OFFICE OF AD-
MINISTRATOR OF THE FEDERAL 
AVIATION AGENCY 
The Senate resumed the consideration 
of the bill (H.R. 7777) to authorize the 
President to appoint Gen. William F. 
McKee (U.S. Air Force, retired) to the 
office of Administrator of the Federal 
Aviation Agency. 
Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, 
when President Johnson learned of the 
intention of Najeeb E. Halaby, Adminis-
trator of the Federal Aviation Agency, to 
resign, he began searching for a man to 
fill this high post?a relatively new post 
In terms of Government agencies?yet a 
post which requires the highest skill and 
knowledge of the art of aviation, the tact 
and diplomacy of an ambassador in deal-
ing with and melding the interests of 
general aviation, commercial aviation, 
and the military, and the experience in 
Government in order to work with the 
various other government agencies, 
State and Federal, on aviation affairs 
and to carry out the desires of the 
Congress. 
In selecting men and women to hold 
high and responsible positions in our 
Government, President Johnson has 
chosen well. His search to find the best 
person for the,job and his refusal to ac-
cept anything less, whatever the pres-
sures upon him were, have set new stand-
ards for the quality of leadership in 
government. 
The man President Johnson has se-
lected to be the next Administrator of 
the FAA, is, as much as any other Pres-
idential appointee, a tribute to the Pres-
ident's wisdom and firm adherence to his 
rule?"the best man for the job." 
Because of a provision in section 
301(b) of the Federal Aviation Act of 
1958 requiring the Administrator to be a 
civilian, it was necessary for the Presi-
dent to ask the Congress to authorize 
him to appoint William F. McKee, a re-
tired Air Force general, to be the Ad-
ministrator of the FAA.

13542 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE dune 17, 1965 
As a former Member of both Houses 
of the Congress the President is respect-
ful of the prerogatives of the Congress 
and has conscientiously given great at-
tention to the wishes of the Congress. 
The bill to authorize the appointment 
of General McKee has been considered 
carefully by the Senate Commerce Com-
mittee and the House Interstate and For-
eign Commerce Committee. Public 
hearings were held by both committees 
and every interested person and organi-
zation were afforded an opportunity to 
testify. Both committees have registered 
their approval of the bill. 
In substance, the bill waives in this 
one instance the requirement in section 
301(b) that the Administrator of the 
FAA be a civilian. It permits General 
McKee to serve as Administrator and 
retain his rank as a retired Air Force 
general. General McKee would be en-
titled, as are all retired regular military 
officers, to receive a portion of his mili-
tary retirement pay under the Dual 
Compensation Act in addition to re-
ceiving the full civilian salary as 
Administrator. 
The bill expressly states: 
[That General McKee] shall be subject to 
no supervision, control, restriction, or pro-
hibition (military or otherwise) other than 
would be operative with respect to him if 
he were not an officer on the retired list of 
the Regular Air Force 
The bill also expressly states the in-
tent of the Congress that this is a one-
time waiver of the requirement that a 
civilian serve as head of the Agency. 
Any further action or waiver of this 
provision would require the passage of 
an act of Congress. Congress has done 
this, so far as the House is concerned. 
It is now up to the Senate to take some 
action. 
I yield to the distinguished Senator 
from Washington. 
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. President, I rise 
In support of the pending legislation to 
authorize the appointment of Gen. Wil-
liam F. McKee. I do not support this 
legislation because General McKee is a 
military man. I support the legislation 
because General McKee is an able ad-
ministrator. 
On June 23, 1964, I made certain re-
marks in the Senate Chamber concern-
ing General McKee on the occasion of 
his forthcoming retirement, which took 
place on July 31, 1964. I read from my 
remarks about General McKee on that 
occasion as follows 
I wish to use this opportunity to take note 
of General McKee's able work and construc-
tive contribution in the Nation's service. 
An outstanding management man, Gen-
eral McKee's assignment as commander of the 
Air Force Logistics Command, and then as 
Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force, brought 
to fruition many improvements in the sup-
port system of the Air Farce which he had 
planned and directed. 
The activities supervised by General Mc-
Kee included both personnel procurement 
and training, and the complex materiel pro-
curement and supply operation required to 
support our combat air forces. 
General McKee stated his objective for the 
modern Air Force as follows: 
"As we move farther into space, there will 
be no room for error?mechanical or human. 
Our efforts today are aimed at the flawless 
support systems of tomorrow." 
During his duty with the Air Force Logis-
tics Command, management improvements 
resulted in a reduction in manpower from 
224,000 to 147,000 and requirements for spare 
parts were reduced by some $7 billion. 
These increases in efficiency were not made 
by sacrificing support to the combat units. 
High-speed movement of priority and high-
value material has reduced the inventory in 
the pipeline: use of electronic data processing 
equipment and improved communications 
can make requirements from the field quickly 
known; and maximum use of aircargo de-
livery methods and equipment can promptly 
provide the necessary equipment. 
As vice commander of the Air Materiel 
Command, and later as commander of the 
Air Force Logistics Command, General McKee 
played a major role in eliminating the vast 
Air Force logistics complex overseas, which 
included large depots in Africa, France, Eng-
land, Japan, and the Philippines. On his 
recommendation, a depot program for Spain, 
at a cost of many millions, was never built. 
As the oversea lOgistics complex was phased 
out, the Air Force went to a concept of direct 
support from the Zone of Interior. This re-
sulted in very sul3stantia1 savings in dollars 
and people. Perhaps more importantly, the 
combat effectiveness of our oversea units 
was significantly improved. 
That is the end of the quotation from 
the statement I made on the Senate 
floor on June 23, 1964, in connection 
with the then pending retirement of 
Gen. William F. McKee from the Air 
Force. 
He is an outstanding administrator. 
He is a man of great integrity. He has 
the confidence of the people of this 
country. He administered procurement 
programs in the Air Force running into 
billions of dollars without a word of 
doubt as to his able, dedicated, and out-
standing performance in those critically 
important programs. 
Mr. President, I support the legislation. 
I intend to support the nomination of 
General McKee. He is a man of great 
ability and I am convinced he will make 
an excellent Administrator of the Fed-
eral Aviation Agency. 
Mr. HARTKE. Mr. President, will the 
Senator yield? 
Mr. JACKSON. I yield, with the per-
mission of the Senator from Oklahoma 
I Mr. MONRONEY], who has the floor. 
Mr. MONRONEY. I yield. 
Mr. HARTKE. Assuming for the 
moment what the Senator has said is 
correct, without contradicting the high 
opinion that the Senator from Washing-
ton has concerning General McKee, does 
the Senator feel, in all fairness to the 
general himself and to the Senate, that 
before the rest of the Senate should pass 
judgment on this man he should not go 
through the customary and regular pro-
cedures of the Senate by coming before a 
committee and having an open hearing 
as to his qualifications rather than hav-
ing only individual testimony of persons 
who know him personally? No such 
hearing has been afforded in this case. 
Mr. JACKSON. I do not think that 
is the issue. It is only a matter of time. 
He will be required to appear before the 
Commerce Committee in connection with 
his nomination. 
This bill simply makes-it possible for 
the President to submit his nomination. 
Mr. HARTKE. That is the very 
essence of the proposition. This is no 
general purpose bill. The bill is directed 
to General McKee. Before the Senate 
passes the bill, it must pass judgment 
upon whether the man is qualified. The 
very essence of the question involved is 
that we are asked to pass a bill and to 
accept the judgment of some persons 
without being afforded the ordinary 
course of a hearing. In other words, 
we are asked to pass judgment on the 
Senate floor, then to have a hearing, and 
at that time pass judgment on the man 
for the second time. 
Mr. JACKSON. I would not Question 
for one moment the necessity of having 
General McKee appear before the Com-
merce Committee, however, I see no rea-
son to require him to appear twice?par-
ticularly since he has not yet even been 
nominated. 
Mr. HARTKE. Does the Senator 
want me to accept his statement as au-
thority? I have respect for him, but I 
d not believe that, under similar dr--
cumstances, the Senator from Washing--
ton would want to dispense with hear-
ings on the nomination of a certain 
person merely because I thought he was 
of the highest quality. 
Mr. JACKSON. I only say that I stand 
an my statement. If the Senator does 
not subscribe to it, obviously, he does not 
have to do so. I notice that the Senator 
circulated a letter questioning whether 
General McKee is an administrator. I 
think what I have said is quite pertinent 
to the letter the Senator sent to every 
Senator. I was speaking only to this is-
sue which the Senator raised in his letter. 
Mr. HARTKE. That is correct. 
Mr. JACKSON. The Senator said that 
1 week ago he was speaking an this bill, 
and the distinguished majority whip 
asked him what unusual qualifications 
General McKee has which make him the 
only person capable of holding the job 
of Administrator. He stated that he did 
not know, inasmuch as the Commerce 
Committee had not had an opportunity 
to question General McKee. 
I am not saying he is the only man. 
The point is that not only was he a great 
officer in the Air Force of the United 
States, but he has been one of the out-
standing administrators in the Pentagon. 
I know that of my own knowledge. He is 
a_man of great integrity. 
I am trying to answer the question 
raised in connection with the letter. 
Mr. HARTKE. I am not denying the 
authorship of the statement or the letter. 
The only question is whether the Senate 
is entitled to do away with organic law 
for one man. That is the first point. 
The second point has to do with the reg-
ular procedures of the Senate which 
would require the man to come before 
the committee and state his qualifica-
tions, and at the same time give mem-
bers of the committee an opportunity for 
examination. 
Mr. JACKSON. The bill before the 
Senate is a Condition precedent to taking 
Up his nomination. It simply enables 
the President to submit his nomination. 
We cannot nominate him. The Presi-
dent makes the nomination does he not? 
This is exactly what was done in the case 
of General Marshall. There is a prece-
dent for it.

June 17, 1965 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 13515 
Committee. It 41091c1 be noted that the 
project has an excellent benefit-cost 
ratio of 1,5 to 1 or the initial phase and 
1.6 to 1 for the ultimate phase. 
The cost of this undertaking?some 
$49 million for the initial phase?is com-
pletely reimbursable from revenues de-
rived from the delivery of water to 
southern Nevada users, with interest. 
The Nevada State Legislature granted 
authority 2 years ago to the State's Colo-
rado River Commission to contract with 
the United States for the repayment and 
to operate and maintain the project 
when it is in service. 
This project has full and unhesitating 
support from every level of State and 
local government in my State and also 
from all responsible civic and business 
groups. 
I urge support for this vital project 
so that the Congress can complete action 
on it as quickly as possible and hasten 
the day it can benefit the robust econ-
omy of southern Nevada. 
Mr. CANNON. Mr. President, I join 
my distinguished senior colleague from 
Nevada c,fr. BIBLE] in urging the Sen-
ate to act favorably on passage of S. 32 
to authorize the southern Nevada water 
supply project. 
My colleague has done yeoman's work 
in pressing for the enactment of this vital 
legislation and has eloquently outlined 
the need for the authorization of this 
Vital project. 
The growth and prosperity of Nevada 
and the entire Southwest is irrevocably 
tied to adequate water development. 
There is no doubt in my mind that the 
Congress realizes the critical need to 
move and move rapidly to meet the 
Nation's demand for water for the 
future. 
This was illustrated just yesterday, 
Mr. President, when the Senate gave its 
wholehearted support to the passage of 
S. 24 to greatly increase the commitment 
of this Nation to accelerated research in 
the field of desalinization. I feel that a 
massive effort to advance desalting tech-
? nology, the support of the Congress for 
various water development projects such 
as the project now before the Senate, 
and programs to finance research in 
weather modifications will help allevi-
ate the water shortage problems that will 
face this Nation in the very near future. 
The southern Nevada water supply 
project is designed to meet the very 
immediate needs of southern Nevada and 
on its passage rest the aspirations of an 
area of my State in which nearly 50 per-
cent of the population resides. 
All costs would be allocated to munici-
pal and industrial water users and would 
be reimbursable by the beneficiaries over 
a 50-year period. It is important to point 
out, Mr. President, that the project has a 
first-stage benefit-cost ratio of 1.5 to 1, 
and a favorable ratio of 1.6 to 1 for the 
ultimate phase. 
There is pritical water supply prob-
lem-in solithern Nevada anci- the southern, 
Nevada water supply project is vital to 
protect and conserve the dwindling 
ground Water resources of Clark County 
and to provide a" sure additional supply 
of water to serve one of the fastest grow-
ing areas in the 'United States. In less 
'southern 
Nevada 
15 years the population of  
Nevada has grown from approximately 
50,000 to more than a quarter of a mil-
lion, and it is expected that nearly 1 mil-
lion persons will reside in southern 
Nevada by the year 2000. 
Thousands upon thousands of persons 
have invested their lives and fortunes 
in southern Nevada and they need?and 
must have?water if they are to survive 
and continue to prosper. 
It is important to point out, Mr. Presi-
dent, that authorization and construc-
tion of the southern Nevada water sup-
ply project will in no way interfere with 
the orderly plans for other Water devel-
opment projects in the arid Southwest-
ern States. Financially and technically, 
the southern Nevada water supply proj-
ect has independence and feasibility. 
The project enjoys the support of all 
interested parties in the State?the Gov-
ernor, the congressional delegation, and 
all municipalities and city groups lo-
cated in the area. 
The Nevada State Legislature recently 
designated the Colorado River Commis-
sion of Nevada as the State agency to 
contract with the Federal Government 
for the repayment of project costs and 
to operate and maintain the project after 
construction. 
If adequate water supplies are not de-
veloped for southern Nevada in the very 
near future, there will be grave damage 
to our economy and our underground 
water supplies. Southern Nevada has 
reached the point in its development 
where the underground artesian basin 
can no longer support its population, its 
industry, and the large Government in-
stallations which - have invested so 
heavily in the area. 
The Senate Interior ,Committee recog-
nized the critical need for this project 
by acting with speed and vigor and re-
ported the bill with very minor amend-
ments. 
The bill enjoys widespread support. 
The project is needed; it is timely and 
reasonable; and it does not interfere with 
the larger plan for the Southwest. 
Its passage is absolutely mandatory 
for the survival, growth, and prosperity 
of the people of southern Nevada and I 
ask the support of the Senate in making 
the dreams of full water resources for 
southern Nevada a reality. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
bill is open to further amendment. If 
there bp 110_ amendment to be proposed, 
the question is on the engrossment and 
third reading of the bill. 
The bill (5. 32), was ordered to be en-
grossed for a third reading was read the 
third time, and passed. 
Mr. BIBLE: Mr. President, I move to 
reconsider the vote by which the bill was 
passed. 
Mr. KUCHEL. ?Mr. President, I move 
to lay that motion on the table. 
The motion to, lay on the table was 
agreed to. 
STATE DEPARTMENT ADVICE RELA-
TIVE TO AMERICAN STUDENT IN-
FORMATION SERVICE 
Mr. SPARKMAN. Mr. President, last 
summer, one of my young constituents, 
a college student, had an unhappy ex-
perience with a 'Luxembourg-based or-
ganization known as the American Stu-
dent Information service. In looking 
into her complaint, I obtained infor-
mation which may be helpful to other 
American students who may contem-
plate employment of the type which she 
obtained last summer in Europe. The 
State Department has prepared a form 
letter in response to many inquiries it 
has received concerning the activities of 
ASIS. 
I ask unanimous consent -that the let-
ter be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the letter 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
DEPARTMENT OF STATE, 
BUREAU or EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL 
AFFAIRS. 
DEAR -: Thank you for your recent 
communication about the American Student 
Information Service (ASIS). The Depart-
ment of State has received numerous in-
quiries concerning the activities of this or-
ganization. 
ASIS was established in Luxembourg in 
1961 after having operated from Denmark 
and, subsequently, Germany. It is a pri-
vate organization with no U.S. Government 
connections. To the best of our knowledge, 
ASIS is not organized under the laws of any 
American jurisdiction, although it is our 
understanding that the two principal officers 
are Americans. Most students traveling to 
Europe under ASIS auspices find employ-
ment in countries other than Luxembourg. 
The American Embassy in Luxembourg re-
ports that it has received numerous com-
plaints about the organization from stu-
dents. On several occasions the Embassy has 
tried on the students' behalf to discuss these 
complaints with the directors of ASIS but 
has found the latter to be "totally uncoop-
erative." In view of this situation, the De-
partment cannot recommend that American 
students participate in the ASIS program. 
For information on summer employment, 
travel, or study programs abroad, you may 
wish to write to well-established, nonprofit 
agencies such as the Institute of Interna-
tional Education, 800 Second Avenue, New 
York, N.Y., 10017, or the Experiment in In-
ternational Living, Raney, Vt. our informa-
tion indicates, however, that the majority of 
temporary job opportunities overseas call for 
volunteer service rather than for paid em-
ployment. 
We enclose a copy of "Opportunities for 
Summer Employment Abroad," which sug-
gests additional sources that may be helpful. 
Sincerely yours,

Director, Public Information and Re-
ports Staff.

Fr 
"MOR ALISM" AND THE 
311 VIETNAM 
Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I may proceed 
for 5 minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. 
Tyra:Ncs in the chair). Without objec-
tion, it is so ordered. 
Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the chair-
man of the Foreign Relations Committee 
made a significant and widely reported 
speech in the Senate Wednesday on our 
Vietnam policy. 
I regret that I was not on the floor at 
the time he made the speech. 
I did not know that he was planning 
to Make the statement; otherwise I 
would have adjusted my schedule in a 
manner that would have permitted my 
presence. 
I am in wholehearted accord with 
many of the points made by the chair-
man in his statement. But there are 
Portions of his statement which I found 
confusing and contradictory and danger-
ous in their implications. 
The Senator from Arkansas spoke for 
all of us when he said that he was op-
posed to an unconditional American 
withdrawal from South Vietnam. He 
said: 
Such action would betray our obligation 
to people we have promised to defend * * * 
would weaken or destroy the credibility of 
American guarantees to other countries * * 
and would encourage the view in Peiping and 
elsewhere, that guerrilla wars supported 
from the outside are a relatively safe and 
Inexpensive way of expanding Communist 
power. 
I commend the Senator from this 
cogent statement on the consequences 
of an unconditional American with-
drawal. 
The chairman of the Foreign Relations 
Committee also performed a distinct 
service in reviewing the many efforts 
that have been made to persuade Peiping 
and Hanoi to come to the conference 
table in an effort to terminate the fight-
ing in South Vietnam. He dealt frankly 
with the stubborn Communist rejection 
of all the approaches that have thus far 
been made to them. He stated?and I 
am in complete accord with this state-
ment?that, despite the rebuffs we have 
suffered, we must be patient and persist-
ent in our efforts to bring about a negoti-
ated settlement. 
All this is to the good. 
But there are portions of the Senator's 
speech which, as I have already indi-
cated, trouble me deeply because they ap-
pear to contradict the intent of the sev-
eral passages to which I have already 
referred. 
The Senator from Arkansas, for exam-
ple, said that we encouraged President 
Diem "to violate certain provisions of the 
Geneva accords of 1954." And at a later 
Point in this speech he urged a return to 
the Geneva accords, "not just in their 
essentials, but in all their specifications." 
I have the distinct impression?and I 
believe the Senator from Arkansas will 
confirm thisthat the portion of the 
Geneva agreement to which he was re-
ferring above all was that clause which 
called for the holding of free nationwide 
elections in, 1956. 
It is completely true that President 
Diem refused to go through with nation-
wide elections in 1956, and that we im-
plicitly supported him in the stand he 
took. 
But he refused to go through with 
these elections for the perfectly valid 
reason that the Communists had set up 
a totalitarian police state in the northern 
Balt of the country, that there had been 
no freedom of press or expression or 
political organization north of the 17th 
Parallel since the control of the area was 
surrendered to Ho Chi Minh, and that 
the Communists had been guilty of basic 
violations of human freedom and of the 
spirit of the Geneva accord which made 
it senseless to talk about "free nation-
wide elections." 
This is a point that cannot be empha-
sized too much. 
By way of establishing the facts for 
the record, I want to quote from a col-
umn by Max Lerner in the New York 
Post on January 24, 1955, written after 
an interview with President Diem: 
Southern Vietnam will take part in the 
meeting to be held in June to discuss prepa-
rations for the 1956 elections. 
Southern Vietnam, since it protested the 
Geneva agreement when it was made, does 
not consider itself a party to that agree-
ment, nor bound by it. 
In any event, the clauses providing for the 
1956 elections are extremely vague. But at 
one point they are clear?in stipulating that 
the elections are to be free. Everything will 
now depend on how free elections are de-
fined. The President said he would wait to 
see whether the conditions of freedom would 
exist in North Vietnam at the time sched-
uled for the elections. He asked what would 
be the good of an impartial counting of votes 
if the voting has been preceded in North 
Vietnam by a campaign of rulthless propa-
ganda and terrorism on the part of a police 
state. 
The scope and the degree of the totali-
tarian terror instituted by the Commu-
nist regime in North Vietnam from the 
day that it was established in 1954, can 
be documented from many sources. 
Among other things, they can be docu-
mented from the official Communist 
press itself. 
Thus, General Vo Nguyen Giap, the 
North Vietnamese military commander 
and the military genius behind the Viet-
cong insurrection, made a statement, re-
markable in its candor, to the 10th Con-
gress of the Communist Party Central 
Committee in October 1956. Let me 
quote a few excerpts from General Giap's 
statement as it was printed in the official 
publication, Nhan Dan, on October 31, 
1956: 
While carrying out their antifeudal task, 
our cadres have underestimated or, worse 
still, have denied all antiiinperialist achieve.. 
ments, and have separated the land reform 
and the revolution. Worse of all, in some 
areas they have even made the two mutual-
ly exclusive. 
We have failed to realize the necessity of 
uniting with the middle-level peasants, and 
we should have concluded some form of al-
liance with the rich peasants, whom we 
treated in the same manner as the land-
lords. 
We attacked the landowning families indis-
criminately, according no consideration to 
those who had served the revolution and 
to those families with sons in the army. We 
showed no indulgence toward landlords who 
participated in the resistance, treating their 
children in the same way as we treated the 
children of other landlords. 
We made too many deviations and executed 
too many honest people. We attacked on too 
large a front and, seeing enemies everywhere, 
resorted to terror, which became far too wide-
spread. 
Whilst carrying out our land reform pro-
gram we failed to respect the principles of 
freedom of faith and worship in many areas. 
General Giap's admissions take on all 
the more significance when it is realized 
that the date on which he made the 
statement coincides roughly with the date 
of the "free nationwide elections" called 
for by the Geneva Convention. 
I think?I hope?the Senator from 
Arkansas would agree that it makes no 
sense to talk about free nationwide elec-
tions in a country that has been cut in 
two when one portion of the country has 
been governed by a merciless dictatorial 
regime for several years. 
I think he would agree that such an 
election could only be held if certain 
basic preconditions were met, including 
complete freedom of press and political 
organization, in both parts of the coun-
try, for a period of at least 1 year before 
the election; and also including a provi-
sion that the elections should be held 
under the auspices and control of some 
international body like the TJnited Na-
tions. 
I hope he does not mean that Diem 
erred in not going through with the 
elections despite the political terror in 
the north, because it is clear as A B C 
that such an election could only have re-
sulted in turning over the entire country 
to communism. 
Let Me point out here that at the Ge-
neva Conference of 1954 the U.S. delega-
tion at one point came out for free elec-
tions in North Vietnam under U.N. super-
vision, and that it was partly because of 
the rejection of this proposal that the 
United States decided against becoming 
a signatory to the Geneva accord. 
In another portion of his statement the 
Senator from Arkansas said: 
It may be that the major lesson of this 
tragic conflict will be a new appreciation of

the power of nationalism in southeast Asia 
and, indeed, in all of the world's emerging 
nations. 
And he went on to say that "largely 
in consequences of our own errors, the 
nationalist movement in Vietnam be-
came associated with and largely sub-
ordinate to the Communist movement." 
To suggest, as this clearly does, that 
the Vietcong movement is a nationalist 
movement is to completely twist the 
the facts. 
No one in Vietnam believes the charge 
that Americans have now come to their 
coimtry in large numbers and are sacri-
ficing their lives in its defense, because 
the U.S. plans to impose some kind of 
neocolonial regime on South Vietnam, 
for the purpose of exploiting its people 
and its resources. 
On the contrary, the overwhelming 
majority of the people of South Vietnam 
look upon the Vietcong movement as an 
instrument of terror and oppression, 
seeking to subjugate them to the new 
Imperialism of Peiping and Hanoi. 
The true nationalists in South Viet-
nam are fighting on the side of the Gov-
ernment. They know that we have in-
tervened at the request of the Govern-
ment, and that our only purpose there 
Is to help them defend their freedom 
against the antinationalist forces of the 
Vietcong. 
But the portion of the Senator's speech 
which disturbed me the most was 'a para-
graph which seemed to blur and confuse 
the truly fundamental moral differences 
between our side and the Vietcong, be-
tween freedbm and communism. 
I want to quote this paragraph to the 
Senate so that no one will be able to 
argue that I have pulled words or sen-
tences out of context in my remarks: 
A great nation?
Said the Senator?
is one which is capable of looking beyond its 
own view of the world, of recognizing that, 
however convinced it may be of the benefi-
cence of its own role and aims, other nations 
may be equally persuaded of their benevo-
lence and good intent. It is a mark of both 
greatness and maturity when a nation like 
the United States, Vrlthout abandoning its 
convictions and commitments, is capable at 
the same time of acknowledging that there 
may be some merit and even good intent in 
the views and aims of its adversaries. 
I am for seeking a negotiated Settle-
ment to theVietnarn war. 
But, I do not concede the Senator's 
contention that "there may be some 
merit and even good intent in the views 
and aims of our adversaries." 
I consider communism to be one of the 
most totally evil regimes ever devised by 
man for the subjugation of his fellow 
man?a regime whose utter amorality 
- and disregard for human life has perhaps 
only been equaled by the Nazi regime in 
Germany. 
The Fascist regime in prewar Italy 
made the trains run on time. But I was 
!'nelier. Prepared to concede any merit or 
'evidence of good intent to the Mussolini 
dictatorship because Of this accomplish-
ment. 
Nor was I ever prepared to concede any 
merit or evidence of good intent to the 
No. 110?B 
nazi regime in Germany heeause it 'suc-' 
ceeded in eliminating unemployment, 
building some working-class houses, and 
producing 'a Prototype of the. modern 
Volkswagon. 
Despite their purely mechanical ac-
complishments, the Nazi and Fascist re-
gimes were evil in terms of every mean-
ingful criterion. They were evil because 
of their total denial of human freedom, 
because of their complete disregard for 
human life, and because they were com-
mitted from the outset to the course of 
aggression. 
In the same way, I believe that com-
munism, whether of the Soviet variety or 
the Chinese variety or any other variety, 
Is evil by any meaningful criterion and 
that men of good will, once they have 
understood its nature, cannot remain 
morally neutral on the issue of Commu-
nist expansion. 
I can see no merit in a regime which, 
whatever its mechanical or statistical ac-
complishments, has wiped out every 
vestige of human freedom, persecuted 
all religions alike, and sought to convert 
Its subjects into brainwashed robots. 
can see no merit in a regime which 
has inflicted more suffering and cost 
More human life than all the wars of this 
century combined. 
I can see no merit in a movement 
openly committed to the conquest of the 
world, which practices expansion through 
subversion, through stealth and through 
fraud, and through so-called "wars of 
national liberation." 
I can see no merit in a regime whose 
terror has since the close of the war pro-
duced a flood of refugees?in Europe, in 
Asia and in the Americas?which by now 
Must number some 15 million. 
I can see no merit in a Vietcong move-
silent organized and supported and di-
rected by Hanoi? and seeking to impose 
its dictatorship by means of a terror that 
has, since 1961, resulted in the assas-
sination or kidnaping of more than 35,-
000 South Vietnamese civilians. 
The refusal to recognize the funda-
mental moral differences between free-
dom and communism, this moral neu-
trality for lack of a better expression, is 
not a new phenomenon. It has existed 
in every decade since the Bolshevik Rev-
olution, especially among the intellec-
tnals and in the academic community. 
Each generation has apparently been 
obliged to pass through its own period of 
Illusion and disillusionment, of confusion 
and enlighten:h.-lent. Thus, during the 
thirties, despite the Stalinist terror and 
the several millions who died during 
forced collectivization and the mass 
purge trials, some of the greatest writers 
and noblest spirits of our times were 
counted among the "friends of the Soviet 
Union." 
One by one, they had to pass through 
their own private process of enlighten-
ment, and the private ordeal of breaking 
with a thing in which they had believed 
profoundly. 
To those who have forgotten the his-
tory of this period, I would recommend 
that they go back and -read a drainatic 
'-book entitled "The God"Who railed," in 
which men of the stature of Arthur 
13517 
Itostier and " Andre Gide and Ignazio 
Silone and Stephen Spender and many 
other prominent names in the world of 
letters, set forth the personalconfessions 
of their experiences as "friends of the 
Soviet Union." 
But perhaps the most eloquent and 
damning confession of all was written 
by a Jewish Lithuanian refugee, Dr. Ju-
lius Margolin, who had also regarded 
himself as a "friend of the Soviet Un-
ion"?until the Soviets occupied his 
country and deported scores of thou-
sands of Lithuanians to slave labor camps 
in Siberia, and gave Dr. Margolin an 
opportunity to see the real Soviet Un-
ion?and not the phony Soviet Union 
that was shown to all the tourists who 
visited Moscow during the thirties and 
came away enraptured by what they saw 
and what they were told. 
Dr. Margolin wrote: 
Until the fall of 1939, I had assumed a 
position of benevolent neutrality toward the 
U.S.S.R. * * * The last 7 years have made 
me a convinced and ardent foe of the Soviet 
system. I hate this system with all the 
strength of my heart and all the power of 
my mind. Everything I have seen there has 
filled me with horror and disgust which will 
last until the end of my days. I feel that 
the struggle against this system of slavery, 
terrorism, and cruelty which prevails there 
constitutes the primary obligation of every 
man in the world. Tolerance or support of 
such an international shame is not permissi-
ble for people who are on this side of the 
Soviet border and who live under normal con-
ditions. * * * 
Millions of men are perishing in the camps 
of the Soviet Union. * * ? Since they came 
into being, the Soviet camps have swallowed 
more people, have executed more victims, 
than all the other camps?Hitler's included?
together; and this lethal engine continues 
to operate full blast. 
And those who in reply only shrug their 
shoulders and try to dismiss the issue with 
vague and meaningless generalities, I con-
sider moral abetters and accomplices of 
banditry. 
These are cogent words. But, as the 
case of Dr. Margolin Mints up, the trag-
edy is that each new generation of in-
tellectuals appears to be incapable of 
learning from the experience of the pre-
ceding generation. Each generation has 
Its quota of party members and fellow 
travelers?and a much greater quota of 
moral neutralists who are not supporters 
- of communism or even friends of the So-
viet Union, but who simply believe that 
we must be operuninded?both about 
the bad points in our own society and 
about the good points in Communist 
society. 
So, while we seek a settlement in Viet-
nam,- let us be under no illusions about 
the nature of the enemy or about the 
cost, in terms of human life and human 
suffering, as well as in terms of our own 
security, if we should fail to hold the line 
against Communist expansion in South 
Vietnam. 
Let us seek an agreement that will put 
an end to the fighting. But let us avoid 
any agreement where our principles are 
so compromised and the free Vietnamese 
so weakened that a Communist takeover 
at an early date is bound to emerge. 
Above all, let us avoid the trap of coali-

tion governments, which led to disasters 
in all of the central European countries. 
Such a solution might provide us with 
a formula which saves face for us very 
briefly. But on the day that it is realized 
that the formula was no more than a 
face-saving device, and that it had led, 
as it was foreordained to do, to a Com-
munist takeover in South Vietnam "the 
credibility of American guarantees to 
other countries, would have been de-
stroyed as effectively as an uncondi-
tional withdrawal would destroy it; our 
obligation to help the Vietnamese people 
defend their freedom would be construed 
as a sham; and Peiping could not help 
but be convinced that its so-called wars 
of national liberation are a relatively 
safe and inexpensive way of expanding 
Communist power." 
The Senator from Arkansas has said 
that the situation demands "major con-
cessions from both sides." I do not know 
whether he was suggesting the possibil-
ity of a coalition government. I hope he 
was not. But certainly his words carry 
the implication that we are being too 
stiff necked, that we are demanding too 
much and offering too little. 
I challenge such a contention. 
President Johnson has made the Amer-
ican position crystal clear. We seek no 
further expansion of the war. 
We seek no territories and no bases 
and no realm of colonial exploitation. 
We seek only the acceptance of one 
condition?that Peiping and Hanoi call 
off their aggression against the govern-
ment and people of South Vietnam, that 
the fighting and killing stop, and that 
the South Vietnamese people be per-
mitted to live their lives in peace and 
as they see fit. 
In return, we have offered to include 
North Vietnam within the scope of the 
multibillion-dollar Mekong River devel-
opment program, with the untold bene-
fits that it would bring to all the peo-
ples of southeast Asia. 
This, in my opinion, is a wise and 
reasonable posture. 
Less than this we cannot ask for 
More than this we cannot offer. 
In closing, I again want to compli-
ment the Senator from Arkansas on his 
forceful presentation of the case against 
complete withdrawal from Vietnam. 
Whatever criticism I may have made of 
certain parts of his statement which I 
considered unfortunate in their impli-
cations, I want to emphasize that we 
apparently see eye to eye, not only on 
the question of immediate withdrawal, 
but also on the need for continuing to 
seek a peaceful settlement of the war in 
Vietnam, despite the obdure which the 
Communists have thus far exhibited. 
Fr-04 
THE WAR IN VIETNAM 
Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, the de-
bate in Congress on Vietnam which is 
beginning to heat up shows signs of be-
ing the type of constructive, intelligent-
criticism that I hope can be useful to the 
executive branch. 
In view of the comments made yester-
day by the Senator from Oregon [Mr. 
Mont] and the Senator from Virginia 
[Mr. ROBERTSON], and a minute or so ago 
by the Senator from Connecticut [Mr. 
Dom] , I should like to make the follow-
ing six points: 
First, in my judgment, we must nego-
tiate with the Vietcong. We shall never 
get peace without doing so. The way to 
do it is to tell Hanoi that it can bring to 
the negotiating table anybody it wants 
to, and that we will talk with whomever 
they bring. This inevitably will include 
representatives of the Vietcong. 
Second, I agree with the Senator from 
Oregon and the Senator from Idaho [Mr. 
CHuscil] that we ought to look toward 
bringing the United Nations into the 
Vietnamese situation. 
Third, the sooner we can get an in-
ternational police force into Vietnam to 
maintain a cease fire and help to keep 
the peace, the better. 
Fourth, I agree with the Senator from 
Arkansas [Mr. FULBRIGHT] that we 
should give serious consideration to re-
turning to the 1954 Geneva accords and 
try to reinstate them. 
Fifth, I agree with the Senator from 
Oregon that we cannot wait for Com-
munist China. We must act without 
Communist China. She is not an enemy 
at the moment. Communist China has 
no military commitment in South Viet-
nam. ? 
Sixth, the problem will not be solved 
by military measures. It will have to be 
done through diplomatic measures, 
hopefully with the aid of international 
institutions. 
Having said that, I agree with the Sen-
ator from Arkansas that until we can 
bring the other side to the negotiating 
table, we shall have to stand fast on the 
ground. I do not want to escalate the 
war. I do no want to see the United 
States turn tail and run. I believe that 
a sound solution for the problem in Viet-
nam can be found. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed at the end of my 
remarks a column entitled "Whom We 
Support," written by Walter Lippmann, 
and published in the Washington Post 
for today, June 17. I am in complete 
accord with the position taken by Mr. 
Lippmann. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
(See exhibit 1.) 
Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, one fur-
ther item in connection with Vietnam 
gives me deep concern. It is an article 
entitled "Saigon Orders Profiteers and 
Terrorists Executed," written by Sey-
mour Topping, and published in the New 
York Times of June 17. The article 
states that the new leadership commit-
tee which is running the South Viet-
namese Government, has stated: 
Vietcong terrorists, corrupt officials, specu-
lators, and blackmarketeers would be shot 
without trial if there was tangible proof of 
guilt. 
In the central marketplace of Saigon, 
soldiers erected sandbag emplacements that 
would permit tiring squads to carry out pub-
lic executions with maximum publicity. 
This is Fascist, this is Communist, this 
is totalitarian action. I hope_ that Am-
bassador Taylor and our State Depart-
ment will lodge the strongest possible 
protest against this barbaric action by 
the South Vietnamese Government and 
will indicate that unless it is promptly 
changed, we will withdraw our support. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the article to which I have re-
ferred may be printed at this point in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD 
as follows:

1;ttnom Wz 'SUPPORT 
/ (By Walter Lippmann) 
Whether we are dealing with Vietnam, the 
Dominican Republic, or with the foreign-aid 
program in general, there is one common 
problem which is crucial and central for all 
the many things we are undertaking. It is 
to find governments that we can support 
which are reasonably honest, efficient, and 
progressive, and are trusted by their own 
people. 
We are learning in Vietnam how difficult it 
Is to defend a country in which there is no 
government which can rally its own people. 
WS are learning in the Dominican Republic 
what happens when there is no recognizable 
legitimate government to receive our mili-
tary backing and our economic help. 
The same difficulty is at the root of the 
disappointment, which is so great in this 
country today, at the results of the foreign-
aid programs. We are, to be sure, much more 
vividly conscious of spectacular incidents 
like the burning of a library, than we are of 
the quiet successes. Nonetheless, there are 
disappointments, so many of them that the 
Senate has now voted Another installment 
of foreign aid with the proviso that there is 
to be a radical reexamination of the whole 
policy within the next 2 years. 
Without attempting to guess what conclu-
sions Will be reached in, these 2 years, it is 
already quite evident that trouble arises 
when aid is funneled through corrupt, reac-
tionary, or highly incompetent governments. 
It is not easy to find enough good govern-
ments in all the emerging and underdevel-
oped countries, and, if we are philosophical 
about it, we must not be surprised at the 
difficulty of finding them. The condition is 
baffling, but that is a concomitant of inex-
perience and backwardness. 
biloreover, American officials who have to 
administer the programs are frequently in 
a quandary. As a general rule the most 
impeccably anti-Communist governments 
are more often than not reactionary, stupid, 
and corrupt?al, for example, the Batista 
government in pre-Castro Cuba, or the Tru-
jillo government in the Dominican Republic. 
On the other hand, the more progressively 
minded parties or factions include almost 
inevitably not only the left but the Com-
munists on the left of the left. It takes a 
lot more acumen And political courage for 
an American official to back a progressive 
faction than it does for ,hira to embrace a 
rightist faction. This dilemma confronts us 
continually in our role as champion of the 
free world in Asia, Latin America, and Africa. 
Nevertheless, in the task of containing the 
expansion of communism there is no substi-
tute for the building up of strong and viable 
states which command the respect of the 
Mass of their people. The President, of 
course, knows this and has frequently said 
it. But the tragedy of our entanglement in 
Vietnam is that we find ourselves fighting 
what is in fact an American rear guard action 
to stave off the collapse and defeat of the 
Saigon government. In this cramped posi-
tion, there is little opening or opportunity 
for us to use our power and our resources 
Ceatruetively in southeast Asia. 
WP Inay leave It to the historians to say 
how and why we are painted into a corner. 
Our task is to bring up our resources of 
power and wealth, which are intact, in order 
to cut down our unavoidable losses to the 
lowest possible cost in lives and in influence. 
In our predicament it is a disservice, I 
think, to inflate and,. emotionalize the stakes 
in Vietnam, to inkite_it appear that the whole 
fittlXre Of America and of the western world 
In Asia and the Pacific is going to be fought 
out and decided in the Vietnamese jungle.

COMMENT ON STATEMENT BY SEN-
ATOR FULBRIGHT ON VIETNAM 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, the 
distinguished chairman of the Foreign 
Relations Committee, Senator FULBRIGHT, 
spoke on Tuesday on the subject of Viet-
nam. His remarks constituted a most 
constructive contribution to the con-
sideration of this critical issue and were 
in the best traditions of the Senate. 
With calmness and deliberativeness, he 
outlined the dimensions of the difficul-
ties which exist in policy respecting Viet-
nam and the restoration of peace in that 
region. It will be, I am sure, of great 
help to the President and it is of great 
help to all of us in our understanding of 
this issue. The speech received very wide 
press coverage and editorial reaction, as 
it warranted. 
I ask unanimous consent that several 
editorials commenting upon Senator 
FULBRIGHT'S statement be printed at this 
point in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the editorials 
were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
[From the New York Times, June 17, 19651 
A LIMITED OBJECTIVE IN VIETNAM 
Decisions in crises determine the direction 
of nations more often that the philosophies 
of tranquil times. But a clear course set in 
advance is essential, nevertheless, in the kind 
of crisis that now seems to be looming in 
Vietnam. 
The Vietcong's annual monsoon offensive, 
sheltered against American airpower by in-
termittent cloud cover, is straining the fiber 
of the South Vietnamese Army this year and 
is leading to a further buildup in American 
forces to over 70,000 men. 
As the ground war intensifies, as American 
as well as Vietnamese casualties rise, there 
will be Inexorable pressure on Washington 
this summer to throw American troops into 
the ground battle in increasing numbers, a 
step-up that under present unfortunate cir-
cumstances appears inevitable. Before this 
typhoon begins to whip about our ears and, 
while the possibility of orderly debate still 
exists, it is essential for the Nation to dis-
cuss its true ends and the means that should 
be employed to serve them. 
Senator FULBRIGHT has taken this discus-
sion forward to a new clarity after a long 
conversation with the President. His views 
should be read by every American?and we 
hope they will be read abroad as an authori-
tative statement. The chairman of the 
Foreign Relations Committee argues cogently 
against both "unconditional withdrawal" 
from Vietnam or an attempt, through esca-
lation, to achieve complete military victory 
attainable "only at a cost far exceeding the 
requirements of our interest and our hon-
or"?a cost that could rise to include ground 
combat with the North Vietnamese Army 
and even "massive Chinese military interven-
tion * * * or general nuclear war." 
The American aim this summer, in Senator 
FULBRIGHT'S view?a view which agrees closely 
with that often expounded on this page and 
over a period of many months?must be a 
"resolute but restrained" holding action. 
The hope is that the Communists will see

13520 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE June 17, 1965 
the futility of trying to win military victory 
and will at length agree to a "negotiated 
settlement Inecesaarily1 involving major con-
cessions hy both sides.' 
At a time when some military men and 
some Republican leaders, including Repre-
sentative Lenin, of Wisconsin, are returning 
to the Goldwater objective of total victory 
and calling for stepped-up bombing of North 
Vietnam, this restatement of aims is invalu-
able. The country and its allies abroad can 
only welcome Senator PULSRIGHT'S assurance 
that the President remains committed to 
ending the war at the earliest possible time 
by negotiations without preconditions. As 
we have previously noted here, there can be 
no such thing as military victory in Vietnam 
by either side, except at a cost so fearful it 
would not be worth the price?and even then 
would not be a victory in anything but name 
Yet the continued American troop buildup 
in South Vietnam, which shortly will triple 
the forces that were there in March, makes it 
vital for the President to speak out publicly 
himself. In recent months there has been a 
kind of ambiguity in administration policy 
that seems to have won the President as 
much support among Goldwaterites as within 
his own party. Only the President can lay 
this concern to rest. 
The issue has been crystallized by Mr. 
LAIRD, who claims that the country will ac-
cept the troop buildup in South Vietnam 
and the casualties that lie ahead only if the 
objective is total victory, not if the outcome 
is a negotiated settlement. It is our con-
viction that Congressman LA/RD has mis-
judged the temper of the Nation as badly as 
Senator Goldwater did last fall. 
The country will support the Vietnamese 
effort only as long as it remains convinced 
that it is a limited effort aimed at limited 
objectives. It will not accept unconditional 
withdrawal. But neither will it pursue the 
win o' the wisp of unconditional surrender. 
As Senator PULBRIGHT pointed out, "We must 
continue to offer the Communists a reason-
able and attractive alternative to [a] military 
victory" that neither we nor they can win. 
[From the Philadelphia Inquirer, June 17, 
1965] 
THE RIDDLE OF VIETNAM 
Senator P'ULBRIGHT'S carefully worded ad-
dress on American policy in South Vietnam, 
and Defense Secretary McNamara's an-
nouncement that about 20,000 more 'U.S. 
troops are being sent to that wartorn south-
east Asian country, point up the enormity of 
the problems confronting -the United States 
In trying to save the South Vietnamese from 
Communist conquest. 
There is no easy solution to the puzzle, 
regardless of whether the emphasis in U.S. 
strategy is on negotiation or military action. 
As Chairman Fm.saroirr, of the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee, sees it, there 
is almost no likelihood of achieving a com-
plete and unconditional military victory 
over the Communist guerrillas in South 
Vietnam?not because the United States 
lacks the resources to achieve such a vic-
tory but because the tremendous cost in 
American lives and resources would be out 
of all proportion to whatever gains could be 
won by insisting on total and absolute ca-
pitulation by the enemy. 
The Senator also believes?and gives equal 
emphasis to the point?that unconditional 
withdrawal of U.S. forces from South Viet-
nam would have disastrous consequences. 
His conclusion is that neither total victory 
nor unconditional surrender is in prospect 
for either side in Vietnam and the war there-
fore must be ended, sociner or later, by ne-
gotiated settlement which will need to in-
volve concessions of some kind by both sides. 
There is much logic to 'Senator Firrailimmx's 
views. What he says, in his own fashion, 
is in line with what President Johnson has 
been trying to achieve for some time. The 
President has offered repeatedly to enter 
into negotiations without preconditions to 
achieve a settlement in Vietnam. He has 
extended to the Communists in North Viet-
nam an invitation to participate in a mas-
sive program of economic development aid. 
Senator Fumnimirr's use of the word "con-
cessions" will arouse alarm among many 
Americans and may have been an unfortu-
nate choice in semantics. Perhaps "mutual 
agreements" or "two-way bargaining" or 
some such term would be more appropriate. 
Call it what you will, it is obviously neces-
sary for successful negotiations to include 
a giving up of something by one side or the 
other in exchange for each gain won at the 
conference table. 
There can be no hope of getting negotia-
tions started, however, unless U.S. military 
forces in southeast Asia are maintained at 
sufficient strength to prevent Communist 
conquest of South Vietnam by force of arms. 
The immediate and urgent need is to stop 
the Red offensive and convince the enemy 
that it has no choice but to negotiate. It is 
In recognition of this need that more U.S. 
troops are being sent to Vietnam. 
[From the Baltimore (Md.) Sun, June 17, 
19651 
EPULBRIGITE CONTRIBUTES 
Senator PULBRIGHT does not know the 
answer for Vietnam, and unlike some other 
Members of the Senate and the House he 
does not pretend to. But Mr. PULBRIGHT IS In 
the true sense a thinking man. When he 
speaks, after carefully marshaling his 
thoughts, he always contributes something 
to a dialog or a debate. He did so, after a 
long public silence on Vietnam, in a Senate 
speech on Tuesday. 
The gist of the address was that in Senator 
FULBEIGHT'S opinion we must persist in our 
support of the South Vietamese Army, con-
tinuing our efforts to persuade the Conarnu-
nista that full military victory is unattain-
able; persist in our hope that such persuasion 
will lead to negotiation?despite the total 
absence so far of a sign on the other side 
of willingness to negotiate?and not escalate 
the war to the point of inviting such counter-
escalation as might threaten general ex-
plosion, a point which he believes may be 
very close. 
Mr. PULSRIGHT praised President Johnson 
for "steadfastness and statesmanship," and 
"patience and restraint," in resisting pres-
sures to expand the war still more. This, 
along with his statement that we must not 
desert the South Vietnamese Army, serves as 
strong support of the President's funda-
mental position. All the more because the 
Senator speaks not for the administration 
but for himself, it helps the President in his 
resistance to those on the one hand who de-
mand American withdrawal and those on 
the other who seem eager to expand the war 
further, regardless of the dangers. 
As to solutions, Mr. PULBRIGHT proposed 
as a general proposition that the United 
States might offer to base a solution on the 
Geneva accords of 1954, which divided the 
old Indo-China, and which have not been 
strictly honored by anybody. This might 
be a way, and it might not. Mr. PULSEIGHT 
is trying to think of all the possibilities, and 
this particular speech at this partciular time 
should help many others try to think, too. 
THE PROPOSED MEXICO-UNILED 
STATES SALINE WATER. CONSER-
VATION PROGRAM 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, the 
purpose of S. 24 is to provide for expan-
sion and acceleration of this Govern-
ment's program of research and de-
velopment in the field of salt water con-
version. This bill, passed by the Senate 
yesterday, will extend the authority for 
the research through 1972, and appro-
priate an additional $200 million to carry 
on our activities in this promising area. 
The existing program has progressed 
to a stage where it shows promise of con-
verting salt water to fresh water at a 
rate which will be economically competi-
tive. 
The adequate supply of fresh water is 
not only a national problem, it is a 
worldwide problem. This has been 
pointed up acutely in recent years. 
Especially in our great Southwest is 
there an awareness of the magnitude of 
the problem. The threatened loss of 
supply has worked a distinct hardship 
not only in the States of our country, but 
also in Mexico, our friend and neighbor 
as well. 
It is my sincere hope that acceleration 
of our desalinization research program 
will contribute to relieving the strain 
brought about by water shortages. I 
can think of no better way to apply mod-
ern technology to peaceful and humani-
tarian purposes. 
I note that the Republic of Mexico 
either has in operation, or is considering 
the construction, of four desalting proj-
ects. One of them, a small pilot project 
on the Gulf of California, marks a mu-
tual effort between the University of 
Arizona and the University of Sonora. 
It is my hope that the benefits of the re-
search resulting from this bill, and those 
resulting from the projects of the Re-
public of Mexico, can be shared for the 
mutual benefit of mankind. 
I make this statement on the basis of 
conversations, conferences, and recom-
mendations made at La Paz, Baja Cali-
fornia, during the fifth reunion of the 
Mexico-United States Parliamentary 
Group. 
At that reunion, the distinguished Sen-
ator from Arizona [Mr. FANNIN], the dis-
tinguished Senator from Vermont [Mr. 
Anc.ml, and I made a suggestion that it 
might be a good idea to develop, on a 
cooperative basis, a Mexican-United 
States program in the desalinization of 
water. We know not only that it would 
be of great benefit to our own great 
Southwest, as well as other parts of the 
country, but also that, if a program of 
this nature could bring about a conver-
sion of salt water to fresh water, and 
thereby irrigate more of our land and 
furnish more in the way of sustenance to 
our people, it would be a demonstration 
of real and needed friendship between 
our two great countries on a humani-
tarian basis. 
Mr. President, I would hope, therefore, 
that the solid example set by our col-
league, the Senator from Arizona [Mr. 
Famuttf] while he was Governor of Ari-
zona, by means of which a cooperative 
water research project in the field of 
desalinization was undertaken between 
the University of Arizona and the Uni-
versity of Sonora, would be given proper 
attention by the appropriate agencies of 
our own Government?the Department 
of the Interior, the AEC, and others?to 
the end that we would be able to under-
