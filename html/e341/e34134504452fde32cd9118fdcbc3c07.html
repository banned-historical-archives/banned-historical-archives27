 VIETNAM
 North Vietnamese forces have resumed large-scale
 offensive activity in South Vietnam's northernmost
 province following a two-week lull.   In Saigon, the
 newly installed upper legislative house has quickly
 settled down to business and there are signs that
 popular interest in the forthcoming lower house
 elections has picked up.
 VIOLENCE INCREASES IN HONG KONG
 Communists in the colony apparently believe their
 terrorist attacks against security forces will have
 a cumulative effect in weakening public confidence
 in the government.
 MILITARY ACTIVITY IN LAOS INCREASES
 The Communists have recently stepped up their mili-
 tary pressure in northern Laos but do not appear to
 be planning a major offensive.
 CULTURAL REVOLUTION REMAINS IN LOW GEAR
 The drive to restore order is now in the seventh
 week and there are signs the Cultural Revolution is
 being transformed into a moderate "study" movement
 dominated by the military.

 NEW SOVIET MILITARY BUDGET AND MILITARY SERVIC:: LAW
 Not all of the 15-percent increase in the nilitary
 budget will be translated into real gains   n capa-
 bility.   The military service law shortens con-
 scriptees' tour of duty and revises retire]ient pro-

 alliance,  and developments in regions outs. de the NATO
 area.   NATO governments now are considering- what
 recommendations they can endorse.
 RUMANIA PLANS ECONOMIC REFORM
 The effect of the program, like those in t:.e other

 FAR EAST
 The drive to restore order in China is now
 in its seventh week and shows no signs of losing
 momentum. Peking has taken new steps to defuse
 the Red Guards and reshape the governmental and
 party chain of command.
 Some Red Guard activists are being shipped
 out of the cities to agricultural jobs in such re-
 mote places as Inner Mongolia, and others are
 being sent back to school.   Classes have reopened
 in many areas.   The battered cadre system is ap-
 parently to play a significant role in the "re-
 indoctrination" of Red Guard youth--a striking
 reversal of the line pushed at the height of the
 Cultural Revolution, when Red Guards were ordered
 to reform cadres.
 The trend toward moderation continues to
 carry over into Chinese foreign relations.   Peking
 cautiously avoided comment on incidents in Hong
 Kong, where there was a sharp increase in terrorism
 last week during the visit of a senior British of-
 ficial.
 After a two-week lull, Communist forces in
 South Vietnam have resumed large-scale action
 against US Marines in the Demilitarized Zone area.
 On the political front,  several North Vietnamese
 diplomats abroad have recently underscored in
 private statements Hanoi's adamant insistence on
 an unconditional cessation of the bombing before
 any US-DRV talks could be considered.   They indi-
 cated that any talks would not concern affairs in
 South Vietnam.

 VIETNAll
 North Vietnamese  (NVA)  forces
 resumed large-scale offensive ac-
 tivity in northeastern Quang Tri
 Province this week following a
 two-week lull.   On 14 October, an
 estimated NVA battalion launched
 a coordinated mortar and ground as-
 sault against US Marine positions
 near Con Thien.   The attacking
 force--identified as the 3rd Bat-
 talion,  101D Regiment of the NVA
 325th Division--was forced to with-
 draw after three hours of fighting,
 leaving 24 dead.   American casual-
 ties totaled 41,                 including 21 killed.
 Along with ground activity,
 the tempo of enemy mortar, rocket,
 and artillery fire against allied
 positions near the Demilitarized
 Zone (DMZ)  was also stepped up.
 The rate of the shellings has not
 approached September's massive bar-
 rages, but as many as 300 rounds
 were fired in a two-day period
 early in the week.
 Elsewhere in I Corps, eight US
 Army battalions conducting two
 search-and-destroy operations along
 the coastal area northwest of Tam
 Ky near the Quang Nam - Quang Tin
 province border,  last week killed
 more than 300 enemy soldiers, bring-
 ing cumulative enemy casualties in
 these operations to nearly 1,000
 since mid-September.
 North of Saigon in the Binh
 Long - Binh Duong province border
 area, elements of the Viet Cong
 271st Regiment, a subordinate of the
 Viet Cong 9th Infantry Division,
 staged a regimental-size attack on
 17 October against a US company pa-
 trol.   In the resulting eight-hour
 battle, following reinforcement of
 the US unit, 103 enemy soldiers were
 killed, while the US lost 58 killed
 and another 61 wounded.   This is the
 largest engagement in South Viet-
 nam's III Corps since last spring
 and the first significant departure
 from the evasive tactics employed
 by Communist forces there through-
 out the summer rainy season.
 Meanwhile, in an area some 30
 miles east of Saigon,  in northwest-
 ern Phuoc Tuy Province, patrols of
 the US 9th Infantry Division have
 discovered a multilevel complex of
 tunnels and storage areas contain-
 ing more than 1,000 rifles and 100
 crew-served weapons--including four
 US-made 75-mm. pack howitzers--
 plus a vast quantity of ammunition
 and medical supplies.   The weapons
 could equip a regimental-size
 enemy force.   Documents found in the
 cache identify the installation
 with a Rear Services Group which
 serves the 274th and 275th regi-
 ments of the Viet Cong 5th Division.
 These units have traditionally op-
 erated in the Phuoc Tuy - Bien_Hoa -
 Long Khanh province area.
 Political Developments
 The newly installed South Viet-
 namese senate has quickly settled
 down to productive work.   Commit-
 tees to handle its administrative
 affairs and to formulate internal
 working rules have already been set
 up.

 Vo Van Truyen, oldest member
 of the upper house, was selected
 as temporary chairman, but de facto
 control has fallen to Catholic layman
 Tran Van Lam, who is being strongly
 promoted for the post of permanent
 senate chairman.   Two other con-
 tenders are nominal Buddhist Tran
 Van Don, whose ten-man slate polled
 the largest vote in the recent elec-
 tion,  and Nguyen Van Huyen, another
 prominent Catholic leader.   Don's
 chances of being selected remain
 good because many senators wish
 to avoid possible Buddhist protests
 over disproportionate Catholic in-
 fluence in the upper house.
 The formation of the first po-
 litical bloc in the upper house--
 the National Democratic Socialist
 Bloc--was announced on 10 October
 by retired General Huynh Van Cao,
 leader of a Catholic-supported list,
 and Nguyen Gia Hien of the Catholic
 Greater Solidarity Forces.   So far,
 the bloc lists only seven members,
 but its leaders hope to attract at
 .least 20 others which would give
 them a near majority in the 60-man
 rapper house.   The bloc's platform
 is a relatively vague program es-
 pousing the establishment of a pro-
 gressive society and a democratic
 government.  According to Senator
 Don,  it is unlikely to attract
 much support outside of the slates
 of Cao and Hien.
 Lower house elections will take
 place on 22 October.   Reports indi-
 cate that electorate interest has
 picked. up in what has been a color-
 less campaig. until this week.   Be-
 cause of the large number of candi-
 dates (1,240 for 137 seats), voters
 are likely t(  be confused and in
 the end may le swayed by a few ef-
 fective camp,igners.
 Hanoi 'n Negotiations
 North V..etnam's stiff line on
 negotiations,-the demand that an
 unconditiona. cessation of the bomb-
 ing must pre,;ede any US-DRV talks--
 was underscored in recent days in
 private stat,:ments by North Viet-
 namese diplomats in several coun-
 tries.   Some of the diplomats were
 more forthcoiiing at the same time
 in describing what would follow a
 bombing halt  indicating that Hanoi
 continues to envisage such "talks"
 as prelimina-y to actual negotia-
 tions and as having to do only
 with US - No-th Vietnamese rela-
 tions and no: the situation in the   25X1
 South.

 VIOLENCE INCREASES IN HONG KONG
 Militant Communists have re-
 cently stepped up their terrorist
 attacks against the Hong Kong se-
 curity services--the prime target
 of their campaign to erode British
 authority.   The Communists appar-
 ently believe their harassment
 will have a cumulative effect in
 weakening public confidence in the
 government.
 The sharp increase in terror-
 ist activity last week was appar-
 ently timed to coincide with the
 visit of the British minister of
 commonwealth affairs.   In their
 recent attacks the Communists dem-
 onstrated greater coordination and
 control, drawing the police to lo-
 cations where bomb throwing mili-
 tants were lying in wait.   Although
 police discipline remains good,
 prolonged terrorism and the gov-
 ernment's reluctance to pay for
 additional life insurance for po-
 licemen is likely to erode morale.
 At the frontier sporadic vio-
 lence continues to be directed
 against security forces.  Hong Kong
 authorities closed a bridge on the
 border with Communist China where
 Chinese farmers abducted a British
 police inspector on 14 October.
 Three other policemen have been
 seized by the Chinese in the past
 two weeks.   Peking, however, re-
 mains cautious and has avoided com-
 ment on any of the recent incidents.

 MILITARY ACTIVITY IN LAOS INCREA:IES
 The Communists have stepped
 up their military pressure against
 strategic government areas in
 northern Laos.   It does not ap-
 pear, however, that any major
 military offensive is planned.
 In the Nam Bac area,  the
 enemy has been harassing the
 government's outlying defensive
 positions around the bases guard-
 ing the northern approaches to
 the royal capital at Luang Pra-
 bang.   On 12 October,  the Com-
 munists inflicted heavy casual-
 ties on two government battalions
 southeast of Phou Kou--a stra-
 tegic hill overlooking the Nam
 Bac airstrip.   The loss of this
 hill would seriously undermine
 the government's base at Nam Sac.
 The airstrip at Nam Bac itself
 was apparently attacked on 15
 October,. but it is still open.
 Although the Communists
 would almost certainly like to
 retake the area from the govern-
 ment.,              it is doubtful that they
 presently are willing to take
 the substantial losses a direct
 assault on Nam Bac would entail.
 The ene:iy's recent attacks
 have upset pans for a government
 offensive to relieve the pressure
 on Nam Bac,  )ut army leaders in
 Vientiane   a)pear determined to
 retain contr)l of this base. Re-
 inforcements have been moved into
 the area fro:i southern Laos and
 at least ninz government battalions
 are now stru>g out in the sur-
 rounding hil.s .
 Farther south, Communist
 forces attac:ed a government bat-
 talion approximately ten miles
 east of Luanj Prabang on 7 October
 and forced i:. to withdraw after
 Jive hours o  heavy fighting. The
 positions we-e reoccupied later
 but the enemT's action forestalled
 a government sweep into an area
 where increa;ed enemy activity
 has been reprted.
 The Comiunists also mounted

 SECRRET
 CULTURAL REVOLUTION REMAINS IN LOI GEAR
 Although sporadic violence
 is still reported in some parts
 of China,  the drive to restore
 order is now in its seventh week
 and. is maintaining its momentum.
 Wall posters have reappeared
 for the first time since 1 Oc-
 tober but their attacks are con-
 centrated on Wang Li,  a radical
 member of the Cultural Revolution
 group who has been in hot water
 since early September.   Peking
 has taken new steps to defuse
 the Red Guards,  and Mao's latest
 "instructions," publicized on
 17 October,  suggest that the
 Cultural Revolution is being
 transformed into a moderate
 "study" movement dominated by
 the military.
 An effort to rid the urban
 centers of Red Guard activists
 and "drifters"  is apparently un-
 der way.   Radio Peking announced
 on 12 October that large numbers
 of "intellectual youths," many
 of whom were probably involved
 in Red Guard activities, had ar-
 rived in Inner Mongolia to take
 part in agricultural tasks.
 Other Red Guards are being
 sent back to school.   Classes are
 apparently beginning again in
 many areas of the country, with
 the "thought of Mao Tse-tung"
 the principal subject of study.
 A People's Daily editorial on
 13 October called for "reindoc-
 trination"  )f the Red Guards and
 stated that regular cadres were
 to be used :o overcome "bourgeois
 ideas" amonr the youths.   This
 is a turnab)ut from the line
 pushed at tie height of the Cul-
 tural Revolution, when the Red
 Guards were ordered to reform the
 cadres.
 The em)hasis on the role of
 the batteret party apparatus may
 indicate thit Peking is attempt-
 ing to cons:ruct new governmental
 machinery f-om the wreckage of
 the party aid bureaucracy.   Im-
 portant lea-lers, who were fre-
 quently referred to at the height
 of the Cultural Revolution merely
 as "respons.ble officials," are
 now general.y identified in the
 press and r,--_dio by a full list
 of their fu:ictional titles.  Ref-
 erences to                                                                              he Communist Party
 itself have also become more
 frequent.
 Mao's murky "instructions,"
 circulated -hroughout China on
 17 October,  stress the importance
 of forming   revolutionary great
 alliances" '?ithin existing or-
 ganizations    This is similar to
 the line ta:.en during the period
 of moderati4)n in February and
 early March when Peking admitted
 that disorders had resulted when
 members of   he same organizations
 belonged to different revolu-
 tionary gro- ps .

 be relayed to all mass organiza-

 According to another broad-
 cast on 17 October the Military
 Affairs Commission of the party
 recently issued a notice spelling
 out the army's role in carrying
 out Mao's new orders, which the
 notice said, had been first is-
 sued during his tour of the prov-
 inces in mid-September--"at the
 hour of decisive victory."
 Military unit party commit-
 tees at all levels were directed
 to hold special conferences at
 which the lessons learned during
 the "previous stage" of the Cul-
 tural Revolution were to be
 summed up, and new measures worked
 out to push the movement forward
 to a "new stage."   Certain army
 units were directed to go "deep
 down"  in factories,  rural areas,
 and schools to publicize Mao's
 instructions among the masses and
 to "study together with them."

 EUROPE
 Britain's bid for membership in the Euro-
 pean communities will be debated in the EC Coun-
 cil early next week.   Although the Commission has
 recommended, and the Five favor, early negotia-
 tions with the British, the French are expected
 to press for further deliberation among the Six.
 Vice Chancellor Brandt's talks with French For-
 eign Minister Couve de Murville this week have
 led to speculation that Bonn--which presently
 holds the Council chairmanship--may be willing
 to postpone a decision on negotiations at least
 until later this year.    The British, meanwhile,
 will presumably advocate their case for entry to
 Chancellor Kiesinger, whose visit to London
 coincides with next week's Council meeting in
 Luxembourg.
 In Berlin, the Soviets once again protested
 to the Western allies against the meeting of
 West German Bundestag deputies in the city this
 past week.   For the first time the protest was
 delivered formally and for the record, but there
 has been no harassment as in years past.   The
 Soviets are interested in keeping European prob-
 lems, including Berlin, out of contention at
 this time.   A Soviet space probe successfully
 reached Venus and transmitted scientific data
 as it descended through the  lanet's atmosphere.

 SECRE F
 USSR STEPS UP COMMENTARY ON ABM I3SUES
 Public Soviet responses have
 attempted to deal cautiously with
 some of the substantive issues
 involved in Defense Secretary
 McNamara's announcement, of the
 US decision to deploy a thin
 antiballistic missile  (ABM)  de-
 fense system.
 A political commentator
 writes in the 11 October issue
 of an important Soviet weekly
 newspaper that the US administra-
 tion's announcement constituted
 a concession to the ABM lobby.
 The writer also contended that
 the decision was prompted mainly
 by domestic political concern
 and by a fear that there might
 otherwise be accusations that an
 "ABM gap" had been permitted to
 develop.
 .By emphasizing the signifi-
 cance of the ABM issue for US
 domestic politics, specifically
 on the question of who will hold
 office, this article not only
 informs the Soviet reader about
 the degree to which pressures in
 the US for ABM deployment grow
 out of the USSR's own ABM pro-
 gram, but also offers some clues
 as to the manner in which the
 USSR's ABM policy is being ham-
 mered out.
 The article also asserts
 that the US is likely to follow
 through to full-scale deployment,
 which. in turn could give it the
 illusion of nuclear invulnerabil-
 ity and thus encourage a policy
 of nuclear blackmail.   Earlier
 Soviet commentaries suggested
 that the US decision was likely
 to be the forerunner of an enor-
 mously expensiTe and largely
 fruitless escalation of the arms
 race.   The pot=_ntially unsettling
 effect of full-scale ABM deploy-
 ment, however, in lessening the
 nuclear powers' restraint in gen-
 erating and dEaling with inter-
 national crises, had hitherto
 been ignored in public Soviet
 pronouncements.
 Soviet commentaries have
 stressed the Enormous cost of
 ABMs--$50-100 billion was the
 cost figure used most recently.
 They have described an ABM race
 as an "essentially useless esca-
 lation of expEnditures in money
 and resources for armament" of-
 fering little additional security
 to those embarking on that course.
 All of the arc uments raised in
 the discussiois of the US deci-
 sion seem to :-eflect the views
 of elements ii. Moscow who would
 prefer arms negotiations to a
 new  arms  race
 Military publications such
 as Red Star-- he sources most
 likely to refect the military's
 opinion which  on balance, prob-
 ably favors f ill-scale ABM de-
 ployment--have remained silent.
 Defense Minister Grechko, how-
 ever, may have suggested the mil-
 itary's viewp)int in his speech
 to the Suprem, Soviet on 12 October.
 At that  time, he warned that
 "imperialism" has not changed its
 aggressive tendencies and that
 "US ruling ci:cles, behind a
 screen of tal:s about peace and
 cooperation,   ire stepping up mili-
 tary preparat_ons against the

 USSR and other socialist coun-
 tries...."  Although this was as
 close as Grechko got to the ABM
 issue, his remarks about US inten--
 tions could well have been in-
 tended to voice the military's
 opposition to talks about limit-
 ing the arms race.
 Secretary McNamara's refer-
 ence to the threat from China and
 his invitation to the USSR to
 join in strategic arms negotia-
 tions have so far evoked no com-
 ment from Moscow.  The silence of
 the Soviet press on these points
 may result in part from the re-
 gime's reluctance to discuss in
 public sensitive issues from
 which the population has been
 shielded.
 It is also probable, however,
 that the regime believes the US
 decision leaves the door open
 for talks, and is unwilling or
 unable to commit itself.  Never-
 theless, in Moscow's public re-
 sponses thus far, there is a hint
 that elements favoring negotia-
 tion are doing the writin
 NEW SOVIET MILITARY BUDGET AND MILITARY SERVICE LAW
 Not all of the recently an-
 nounced 15-percent increase in
 the Soviet military budget for
 1968 will be translated into real
 gains in military capability.
 Part of the rise may reflect
 changes in prices and accounting
 procedures.
 The Soviets also have stated
 that expenditures for science
 will grow 11 percent next year.
 Some of this gain probably will
 be allocated to military projects.
 Estimated defense outlays
 for 1967--including five or six
 billion rubles not funded through
 the defense budget--are expected
 to exceed 20 billion rubles.
 This includes the space budget
 and is equivalent to about $55
 billion.
 Some strategic missile pro-
 grams, fighter and transport air-
 craft procurement, and research
 and development of new weapons al-
 most certainly will receive larger
 budgets next year.
 The USSR also has approved a
 new military service law that re-
 duces the typical conscript's
 service from three years to two.
 It also raises the compulsory re-
 tirement age for company and field
 grade officers and requires most
 general officers to retire between
 the ages of 55 and 60.
 The new law is to take ef-
 fect on 1 January 1968.   The changes
 should lead to the retirement of a
 large number of men now occupying

 Ministry and should provide greater

 HARMEL STUDIES PRESENTED TO NATO MEMIERS

 members.   NATO governments are

 country has been free to make
 suggestions regarding the final
 report.   Authi)rity for accept-

 however, has Nested with the
 group rapporteurs.  The rappor-
 teurs  have no-. been required to
 clear their wi+rk in detail with
 their home go'ernment and it
 remains to be seen how much of
 the substance of the reports
 will win gene:-al approval.
 The four studies concern
 East-West relations, including
 the problem of divided Germany,
 interallied relations, the gen-
 eral defense policy of the al-
 liance,  and developments in
 regions outside the NATO area.
 Each topic has been the re-
 sponsibility of a separate group
 which has met periodically dur-

 15 NATO countries were rep-

 North Atlantic council.   The
 Dutch rapporteur feared that a
 general summary would result in
 watering down the several reports.,
 The West German rapporteur, on
 the other hand, believed a sum-
 mary might make it more difficult
 later to soften positions irritat-
 ing to the French.  When the
 studies were delivered to Secre-
 tary General Brosio, a summary
 was prepared, but the rapporteurs
 prevailed on Brosio to explain in
 a letter to the Council that they
 assumed no responsibility for it.
 The range of potential reactions
 among NATO members to objections
 the French may raise thus remains
 wide.
 Although generally pleased by
 the studies so far, Brosio is not
 optimistic about probable French
 reactions.  He believes, however,
 that working for agreement is
 worthwhile  even if France ac-
 cepts only one or two of the con-
 clusions.
 Brosio now is considering
 trying to get a minimum agreement
 with the French in subministerial
 meetings in the next few weeks,
 in anticipation of the regular
 ministerial meeting in December.
 He would continue study on un-
 agreed issues afterward.
 The report on the general de-
 fense policy of the alliance is
 relatively noncontroversial.   Ma-
 jor difficulties are probable with
 respect to the studies on inter-
 allied relations and on develop-
 ments outside the NATO region.
 In both cases objections are ex-
 pected to proposals for greater
 coordination of the policies of
 NATO countries.
 RUMANIA PLANS ECONOMIC REFORM
 Rumania has decided to em-
 bark on a program of economic re-
 form similar in design to those
 now being carried out in the other
 Eastern European countries. The
 leaders of the regime have de-
 cided to go beyond tinkering with
 the existing system of planning
 and management and to make broad
 changes in industry, trade, bank-
 ing, and the wage and salary
 structure.

 The new measures will trans-
 fer to new intermediate organs
 much of the responsibility which
 economic ministries and other
 central state organs now exercise
 over day-to-day operations of in-
 dustry.   The central organs will,
 however, continue to set the
 major guidelines for economic
 development and to bear ultimate
 responsibility for the fulfill-
 ment of plans.
 As in all the Eastern Euro-
 pean countries, except Hungary,
 the responsibilities being taken
 away from the ministries are be-
 ing transferred not to individual
 enterprises but to new economic
 units interposed between the min-
 istry and enterprise levels.
 These new units, to be called
 "industrial centrals," will com-
 prise groups of enterprises and
 will assume some of the planning
 and management functions pre-
 viously exercised at the central
 government level.   They also will
 have substantial responsibility
 for the conduct of foreign trade.
 The managements of individual
 enterprises will also have a
 greater measure of independence
 in the conduct of operations.
 The draft program also pro-
 poses the elimination of budget
 subsidies to cover enterprise
 .losses,  a reduction in the role
 of the budget in providing enter-
 prises with operating funds,  and
 a greater reliance on the enter-
 prises' own funds and on bank
 :Loans for enterprise investments.
 Some decentralization of price
 setting is contemplated, and
 wholesale prices are to be based
 on costs and reflect the relative
 scarcities of some raw materials.
 More contract_ng directly between
 producers and buyers has been
 recommended.
 Incentives for administrators
 and employees will be increased,
 and a closer _ elationship is to
 be establishes  between perform-
 ance and remuneration.   The regime
 also plans to establish new spe-
 cialized bank:  for industry and
 commerce,  agr:culture,  and foreign
 trade.   Some cf these innovations
 have already keen put into effect
 on. a limited cr experimental basis.
 The Rumanians cite the need
 to maintain rzoid economic growth,
 to improve efficiency, and to
 adapt to mode]n scientific and
 technological advances as the
 reasons for proposing new methods.
 In doing so, they are not facing
 any immediate difficulties in
 continuing to achieve rapid eco-
 nomic growth.   They are looking
 ahead several years in anticipa-
 tion of increasing difficulty in
 maintaining tle rapid growth of
 industrial prcduction and of the
 exports necessary to help finance
 imports of adhanced equipment and
 industrial materials.
 The measures are scheduled
 to be discussE-1 and evaluated by
 a special national party confer-
 ence in early December, and pre-
 sumably will he promulgated by
 the Grand National Assembly later
 in the month.  No schedule for
 introducing the new measures has
 been laid down, however, and the
 government will move cautiously
 in the tasks cf implementation.

 FINNISH COMMUNISTS MOVE TOWARD MORE LIBERAL ORIENTATION
 The Finnish Communist Party
 (FCP),   long controlled by arch-
 conservatives who have bitterly
 resisted moves to de-Stalinize
 the party, has taken a major step
 toward a break with the past.
 At a meeting of the party
 Central Committee last month,  a
 majority of the members overrode
 the opposition of the old guard
 and approved a draft party pro-
 gram which commits the FCP to
 "peaceful transition to social-
 ism."  The question of whether
 the FCP should seek power by the
 parliamentary route or by violent
 means has been the subject of
 bitter debate in recent months
 between the liberal faction and
 the old guard.
 During the meeting, the
 old guard also renewed its attack
 on Communist participation in
 Social Democratic Prime Minister
 Paasio's coalition which has
 been in power since May 1966.
 They also lashed out at the FCP
 leadership for its decision to
 support President Kekkonen in
 his bid for re-election next
 February without exacting con-
 cessions.
 In their continuing struggle
 with the conservatives, the lib-
 erals have had the strong backing
 of Moscow, which has sent a num-
 ber of ranking ideologists to
 Helsinki during the past year or
 so to encourage moves toward
 change.   These officials have
 stressed to the FCP leadership
 the importance the Soviet party
 attaches to continued Communist
 participation in the Finnish Gov-
 ernment.   This is considered an
 example to other countries in
 Western Europe where Communist
 or neo-Communist parties hold the
 balance of power.
 The relatively passive and
 restrained role played thus far
 by the Finnish Communists in the
 government suggests that both the
 FCP and Moscow are anxious to dis-
 arm critics both in and outside
 Finland who remain unconvinced
 of the sincerity of the commit-
 ment of Communists to the demo-
 cratic process.   The FCP, as one
 of the Communist parties in West-
 ern Europe commanding mass sup-
 port, has up to now been the lone
 holdout on the issue of publicly
 espousing peaceful transition.
 (The FCP's electoral front organi-
 zation has consistently polled
 some 20-25 percent of the popular
 vote in postwar elections.)
 In view of the continuing
 economic problems the Paasio gov-
 ernment faces and the need to
 adopt belt-tightening measures,
 the Communist liberal faction
 will be increasingly hard-pressed
 to persuade the rank-and-file of
 the benefits to be gained by re-
 maining associated with the gov-
 ernment and its policies. The FCP
 may have trouble, for example,
 as a result of the government's
 decision last week to devalue
 the finnmark, a step which will
 hit industrial workers harder
 than any and which is likely to
 give the old guard Communists ad-
 ditional ammunition in their
 struggle with the liberals.

 MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA
 25X1
 Political instability continues to plague
 many of the governments in the area.
 As the Egyptian evacuation in Yemen proceeds,
 President Sallal's position grows more precarious.
 The make-up of Sallal's new cabinet reveals a lack
 of faith among republicans in the survival of any
 regime identified with Cairo.   More and more Yemenis
 are writing off the republic as a lost cause, and
 the royalists are reportedly preparing for a massive
 assault on major towns.
 .   In South Arabia, prospects for political sta-
 bility are still very dim.   London hopes to com-
 plete its withdrawal by 20 November, but the final
 phase cannot be carried out until the new coalition
 government agrees to final arrangements for inde-
 pendence.
 Continued Arab terrorist activities against
 Israel may force Tel Aviv to take some retaliatory
 action against Syria and Jordan.   King Husayn,
 meanwhile, has in effect refused to talk with the
 Israelis on joint control of terrorist movements.
 In India, another state is on the brink of
 political disaster.   The resignation of leftist
 ministers from the governing coalition of Uttar.
 .Pradesh leaves the chief minister without a de-
 pendable majority in the assembly.   The regime,
 like that in West Bengal, remains in office primarily
 because the opposition cannot close ranks.
 In Africa,  the military junta in Sierra
 Leone continues at odds with its leader, Juxon
 Smith.  F_                                      I

 strike at Jordan.   This, however,
 may be a feint to. cover a move
 aimed at the Syrians, whom the
 Israelis hold chiefly responsible
 for aiding and training the ter-
 rorists.   If the Israelis under-
 take a cross-border military
 strike,  it could include ground
 forces as well as air strikes
 because the Israelis now hold
 more favorable terrain vis-a-vis
 the Syrians than they did before
 the June war.
 King Husayn, meanwhile, has
 in effect rejected an Israeli
 request for a meeting of Israeli
 and Jordanian senior military
 commanders to discuss means of
 preventing the movement of ter-
 rorists into Israeli-controlled
 territory.   The Jordanians fear
 that if they agree to the re-
 quest,  they would be accused of
 collaborating with the enemy.
 The Jordanians have not said "no"
 outright,  fearing that such a re-
 fusal might pravide the Israelis
 with a pretext for punitive ac-
 tion on the grDunds that the Jor-
 danians were unwilling to coop-
 erate.
 In pushin_p for such a meet-
 ing, the IsraeLis are probably
 looking for a  :direct contact which
 might eventually lead to bilat-
 eral peace talcs.   They have long
 felt that their best chances for
 a "settlement" lay in this direc-
 tion.
 In an eff)rt to force the
 King to agree  :o a meeting, the
 Israelis probably will further
 restrict movement across the Jor-
 dan River and :ake much tougher
 action against those whom they
 catch in the a:t.   If provoked
 far enough, th! Israelis might
 even undertake operations against
 Jordanian villages harboring ter-
 rorists, despise the outcry this
 could create LL the United Nations.

 J
 NEW SESSION OF TURKISH PARLIAMENT MAY BE STORMY
 The Turkish Grand National As-
 sembly, which reconvenes on 1 Nov-
 ember after a three-month recess,
 must deal with several controversial
 issues, some of which were held over
 from the last session.
 The ruling Justice Party, headed
 by Prime Minister Demirel,  is ex-
 pected to push some highly contro-
 versial legislation which is bound
 to face sharp but largely ineffec-
 tive opposition.   Some members of
 the opposition, frustrated by having
 little or no influence in the gov-
 erning process, have expressed doubt
 that Turkey is ready for parliamen-
 tary democracy.   Some in the mili-
 tary, never reconciled to the return
 to parliamentarism after the 1960
 coup, would prefer autocratic rule.
 tonal election from 1969 to coin-
 cide with the senatorial and local
 elections scheduled for 1968.   The
 Justice Party probably feels confi-
 dent that it could increase its ma-
 jority in the lower house as well
 as clear out some deadwood among,
 its members in an earlier election.
 The government also may have
 to re-enact most of the legislation
 passed during the last session of
 the assembly.   There is speculation
 that the Constitutional Court may
 rule, on procedural grounds, that
 all legislation passed after the
 opposition Republican Peoples'
 Party split last spring is uncon-
 stitutional.  This would further
 delay the government's program and
 do nothing to enhance the prestige
 of the assembly.
 Demirel's priority legislation
 probably will include measures to
 restrict the disruptive activities
 of the "left."  Any legislation to
 curb the "left" will run into vo-
 ciferous opposition from leftist
 elements in the press, labor, and
 among the politically active stu-
 dents, as well as from the Marxist
 Turkish Labor Party.
 Demirel also hopes to pass a
 long-pending amendment to the elec-
 toral law, which would eliminate
 the cumbersome "national remainder"
 system which favors the minor par-
 ties.   Debate on this issue two
 years ago led to a lengthy filibus-
 ter and even raised the possibility
 of new military intervention.   The
 government finally shelved the bill,
 but it is determined to pass the
 measure prior to the next assembly
 election.
 The government may also ad-
 vance the date of the national depu--
 Demirel has come a long way
 in the past two years toward es-
 tablishing himself, his party, and
 his concept of democracy.  None-
 theless, he still faces pressures of
 of factionalism within his own
 party and the lingering uncertain-
 ties of the postrevolutionary pe-
 riod. Basically, he is a moderate
 and is intent on unifying the na-
 tion and building it into a modern
 Western-type country.  Most of those
 aligned against him in his party
 are either ultraconservatives,   re-
 vanchists, or religious reaction-
 aries.  Any of these groups, regard-
 less of size, could hinder his for-
 ward-looking program by promoting
 dissension within the party.   He,
 therefore, probably will move to
 neutralize the larger groups and,
 at the same time, strengthen his
 own moderate front both within the
 part  and within the government.

 GOVERNMENT CHANGES IN AFGHANISTAN
 The resignation of Afghan Prime
 Minister Maiwandwal on 11 October
 probably will be followed by the ap
 pointment of conservative Deputy
 Prime Minister Nur Etemadi  as his
 successor.   The ailing Maiwandwal,
 now in the US  for medical treatment
 temporarily continues as titular
 prime minister.   A cabinet minister
 has been designated acting prime
 minister until the appointment is
 officially announced.
 The King apparently decided to
 delay the announcement of the new
 prime minister in order to consult
 the lower house of Parliament which
 must approve the appointment of the
 prime minister and his cabinet.
 Even though the King could probably
 railroad his selections through the
 house which reconvened on 15 October
 he apparently wishes to avoid the
 kind of acrimony that frequently
 disrupted relations between Parlia-
 ment and the Maiwandwal cabinet
 when the deputies believed they
 were not fully consulted about ma-
 jor decisions.   Despite the King's
 caution, executive legislative re-
 lations might not improve substan-
 tially under Etemadi
 Etemadi would be unlikely to
 make any major changes in Afghan-
 istan's domestic and foreign pol-
 icies.   His appointment would af-
 fect political alignments within
 Afghanistan, however, particularly
 those associated with recent attempts
 to form political parties.
 Although political parties are
 prohibited until the enabling leg-
 islation is passed, Maiwandwal had
 been attempting to form a party
 loyal to the government in order to
 facilitiate passage of his programs.
 His efforts brought sharp criticism
 from members of the cabinet,  includ-
 ing Etemadi himself.   Etemadi would
 probably be loath to engage in party
 organizing and thus might abandon
 the field to leftist circles to con-
 tinue recruiting members.   This
 could put the government at a dis-
 advantage when the bill allowing
 parties is finally approved.
 Etemadi's appointment probably
 would not lead to any major policy
 changes in Afghanistan's avowed
 policy of neutrality toward Commu-
 nist and Western countries.   As a
 leading advocate of Pushtunistan--
 self-determination for Pushtun tribes
 in West Pakistan--his hard-line at-
 titude may auger ill for Afghanis-
 tan's relations with Pakistan which
 are now barely correct.

 WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 Che Guevara's death and its implications con-
 tinue to be the major topic of interest in Latin
 America.
 Extreme rightists and extreme leftists are,
 respectively, elated and dejected, but little ac-
 tion has yet taken place.   Security forces in most
 Latin American countries, however, are anticipating
 mock funerals and other commemorative demonstra-
 tions by students and other youth groups and are
 bracing themselves for possible action: in the
 streets of the major cities.
 The Latin American Continental Students'  Or-
 ganization in Havana has urged student groups to
 decree a state of mourning at their universities
 and to follow Guevara's example by "redoubling the
 anti-imperialist struggle."
 Fidel Castro, in eulogizing Guevara, acknowl-
 edged that his death was a tremendous blow for the
 revolutionary movement but called it a stroke of
 luck for the imperialists and predicted that "new
 commanders will rise from the ranks and files of
 the people" to take Guevara's place.
 In Uruguay, strikes and work stoppages are
 easing off in the face of strong government action
 against Communist-inspired labor agitation.   In
 Peru, however, the government has been forced to
 grant a 10-percent wage boost and is under pressure
 for a larger increase to offset the effects of de-
 valuation.
 Plans for demonstrations in Argentina on the
 anniversary of Juan Peron's release from prison on   25X1
 17 October 1945 fizzled, illustrating the lack of
 solidarity among the ex-dictator's followers.

 EFFECTS OF "CHE" GUEVARA'S DEATH
 The death of Ernesto "Che"
 Guevara at the hands of the Bo-
 livian Army has dealt the Cuban-
 sponsored guerrilla movement in
 Latin America its sharpest blow
 to date.
 Documents seized over the
 past several months indicate
 that Guevara entered Bolivia in
 November 1966 and was still in
 the process of organizing and
 training a guerrilla band when
 forced into combat with an army
 patrol the following March.   Al-
 though the first series of con-
 tacts with Bolivian troops re-
 sulted in one-sided victories
 for the guerrillas,  the tide
 gradually turned,  culminating
 in Guevara's capture on 8 Octo-
 ber and his death the next day.
 Circumstances surrounding his
 death are still clouded but it
 is  probable that Guevara, in-
 jured in the fighting, was cap-
 tured alive and later executed
 by the army.
 Fidel Castro admitted Gue-
 vara's presence in Bolivia on
 15 October when he delivered a
 somber and emotional two-hour
 speech,  conceding:   "We have
 reached the conclusion that these
 news reports concerning the death
 of Major Ernesto Guevara are
 sadly true."
 The rema ping guerrillas
 in Guevara's Nand are under strong
 pressure from the Bolivian Army,
 which is cont.nuing its mop-up op-
 erations.   Th<  guerrillas, now un-
 der the leade:'ship of Guido "Inti"
 Peredo,  are f1w in number and are
 reportedly shcrt of food and am-
 munition.
 Castro alparently has written
 them off as ar  effective fighting
 force.   In hi: speech he said:
 "There is no cuestion but that
 the guerrilla movement in Bolivia
 is in a phase in which the sur-
 vival of the cuerrillas depends
 basically on t_zeir own capacity,
 depends on their own strength...."
 So it is a matter of survival
 rather than of military capability.
 Castro ha   certainly been
 dealt a severe psychological re-
 verse.   Cuban                                                                           involvement with the
 insurgents and Havana's known de-
 sire to make Bolivia an example
 of victorious      `armed struggle" are
 well documentel.   Guevara's death
 will further d_ssipate the myth of
 guerrilla invii.cibility and will
 dim the enthus_asm of other

 revolutionaries in Bolivia and
 elsewhere in Latin America who
 may have been considering ini-
 tiating guerrilla activities.
 The removal from the scene of
 Latin America's leading expo-
 nent of guerrilla warfare and
 the shattering of his insur-
 gent band come at a time when
 the rebel groups in Venezuela,
 Colombia, and Guatemala are
 also suffering reverses at the
 hands of the military forces..
 Castro, however, is un-
 likely to discontinue his pol-
 icy of exporting revolution
 in the face of these reverses.
 Furthermore, Latin America's
 economic and social conditions
 will remain fertile ground for
 the growth of insurgency.
 POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN URUGUAY
 The Uruguayan Government
 is continuing its hard line on
 Communist-inspired labor agi-
 tation.   Strikes and work stop-
 pages have diminished.
 Foreign Minister Luisi
 has taken advantage of last
 week's cabinet resignations
 to press President Gestido for
 changes in economic policy.
 Some of the administra-
 tion's most avid proponents of
 strong central economic con-
 trols were among those who re-
 signed to protest the govern-
 ment's hard line on labor.
 In their absence Luisi and his
 supporters in the cabinet and
 in the President's economic
 team have begun drawing up a
 new economic program.   They
 recognize the importance of
 reaching a stand-by agreement
 with the International Monetary
 Fund  (IMF)  and in an attempt
 to do so will presumably defer
 to IMF recommendations for
 less reliance on central con-
 trols.  The head of the cen-
 tral bank recently traveled to
 Buenos Aires to meet with the
 fund's director-general and
 returned optimistic regarding
 an eventual agreement.
 In the hope of making his
 program work without turning
 to the political opposition,
 Luisi is trying to bring the
 most powerful faction of
 Gestido's divided Colorado
 Party back into the government.
 His prospects are improved by
 indications that individuals
 close to Jorge Batlle, the
 faction's leader, also appear
 25X1
 to be seekin  a political ac-
 commodation.
