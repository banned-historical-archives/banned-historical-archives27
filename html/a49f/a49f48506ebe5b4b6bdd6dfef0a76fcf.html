 Communist China: For the second time in less than a
 month, Me.   inese. Communist party's top theoretical. jour-
 nal, Red Flag, has emphasized that. negotiations between. the
 bloc andthe. West, regardless of their success in "reaching
 some sort of agreement," should not lead Communists to
 abandon their long-term struggle against the. West.  The ar-
 ticle, apparently directed toward justifying the. continuation
 of the "tense situation" in Sino-American relations, rebuts
 the. "revisionist" view of Tito--and, by implication, the. views
 of Khrushchev--that "nations can relax" and asks:. "Is there
 .tranquillity in. our Taiwan Strait.?"
 . USSR-India: Moscow has reportedly offered New Delhi
 "unlimited' amounts of crude. oil .at discount prices in an at-
 tempt to stress the USSR's ability to supply India's petroleum
 needs. Despite the attractiveness of the offer, New Delhi
 would encounter difficulty in utilizing. much Soviet crude, but
 may use the Soviet offer. to exert pressure for pricing conces-
 sions from the. three Western companies which operate most of
 India's refining capacity.

 Peiping Reaffirms Disagreement With Soviet Policy of Detente
 For the second time in less than a month the Chinese Com-
 munist party's top theoretical journal, Red Flamm, has emphasized
 that negotiations between the bloc and the West, regardless of
 their success in "reaching some sort of agreement," should not
 lead Communists to abandon their long-term struggle against
 the West.  The article, apparently directed toward justifying
 the continuation of the "tense situation" in Sino-American re-
 lations, rebuts the "revisionist" view of Tito--and,by impli-
 cation, the views of Khrushchev--that "nations can relax9"
 and asks: "Is there tranquillity in our Taiwan Strait?" The
 article strongly implies that foreign policy differences between
 Peiping and Moscow arise mainly from the Chinese view that
 China has nothing to gain from a policy of detente with the
 West.
 The latest Red Flag article suggests that Peiping may be
 developing a strong propaganda line in anticipation of possible
 developments at the summit and disarmament conferences. On
 22 April the chief of the party's propaganda department stated
 that although it is "entirely permissible and necessary" that
 bloc countries conduct negotiations with. the West, they should
 guard against reducing their "revolutionary spirit."

 policies.  The article implies that Lenin's."original" con-
 clusions and a Communist's "usual conception of Leninism"
 have been distorted for policy reasons, by Moscow, particular-
 ly on. the.. issue of the inevitability of war. It insists that local
 wars still "count as wars" and emphasizes, in a tone contrary
 to that of statements made. at the Soviet 21st party congress,
 the. continuing possibility of war.
 In another area of Sino-Soviet difference, the representa-
 tive of Peiping's official news agency
 in. East Berlin stated on
 14. April that Mao Tse-tung is the most important living 1V{arxist

 k
 an

 s just behind Lenin. in interpreting Marxist philosophy
 correctly.  He characterized Khrushchev as "simply" premier
 of the USSR and first secretary of the. Soviet party, implying
 that the. Soviet, leader is a. theorist of little stature in Chinese
 -eyes.  These views
 are.in. line with extravagant claims-being made publicly for
 Mao in China.

 USSR Offers "Unlimited" Quantities of Crude Oil to India
 Moscow reportedly has offered New Delhi "unlimited"
 amounts of Soviet crude oil and some refined products at dis-
 count prices with payment in Indian rupees.  While couching
 its offer in unusually attractive terms to stress its willing-
 ness to supply a major part of Indiab petroleum needs, the
 Soviet Union probably hopes to achieve only limited results
 by partially replacing Western oil suppliers.
 Despite the attractiveness of the Soviet offer, not only in
 price but also in foreign-exchange savings, India would face
 major difficulties in utilizing Soviet crude.  The three Western-
 owned refineries which process all of India's imported crude
 (35,000,000 barrels in 1959) would not be obligated under their
 present contracts to use the Soviet crude and would certainly
 resist any Indian pressures in this direction.  The only govern-
 ment-owned refineries, Barauni and Gauhati, both of which are
 being built with bloc assistance, are located well inland in east-
 ern India and are designed to refine the relatively small quanti-
 ties of crude oil produced by India.  New Delhi may, therefore,
 accept the offer of refined products as part of a long-term agree-
 ment already reported in the offing, while using the offer of
 Soviet crude as a lever to extract pricing concessions from the
 Western companies.
 This is the first time the USSR has offered crude oil to
 India, Earlier Soviet-Indian oil negotiations resulted in the
 inclusion, for the first time, of small amounts of Soviet pe-
 troleum products in the annual trade agreement for 1960-61.
 The USSR frequently has exploited trade opportunities in other
 underdeveloped countries by agreeing to provide Soviet on in
 barter or soft currency transactions.

 South Korea
 The announcement that President Rhee has agreed to a par-
 liamentary system of government with a cabinet headed.by a
 prime minister is probably a device to resolve the present po-
 litical. crisis by eliminating the. controversial vice presidency.
 The fraudulent tactics used in the 15 March election of Yi Ki-
 pung to the. vice presidency sparked the recent outburst of popu-
 lar violence. Under a parliamentary system prior to 1954,
 Rhee as president was able to exercise. the powers usually as-
 sociated with the prime minister. It is problematical whether
 any prominent members of the opposition Democratic party would
 participate in a coalition if such an arrangement is proposed by
 Rhee.
 Rhee may contemplate selecting a prime minister. from
 among five former political lieutenants with whom he consulted
 on 21 April. The five, whose. popularity is questionable, had
 been dropped by Rhee after either. outliving their usefulness or
 showing signs of acquiring political power of their own. Rhee's
 objective may be to install a man who could assure the admin-
 istration's control over the Liberal. Party and National Assem-
 bly.
 Rhee, who has maintained that the nationwide demonstra-    25X1   25X1
 tions were Communist=instigated, may have belatedly recog-
 nized to some extent the public resentment against his admin-
 istration. Nevertheless,
 Rhee is under pressure from leaders of the Liberal
 Party, the police and the State. Council not to agree to decisions
 which would work against them] The embassy and American
 information officers throughout South Korea report that US state-
 ments on the current situation have excited great interest among        25X1
 the Korean people.

 cratic party whose term expires on 15 August, has resigned, and

 Ti Ki-pung has publicly said he is considering. renouncing his
 election. Chang told the American army attache on 22 April
 that, following his resignation, the party will file a resolution
 in the National Assembly calling for the resignation of Pres-
 ident Rhee, and Yi Ki-pung. Chang's resignation probably is
 intended to maintain the momentum of the popular. drive, and
 it will provide further unsettling effects on the South Korean
 situation.-)
 Student restiveness continues throughout South Korea, with
 one major demonstration reportedly dispersed on 22 April by
 police without casualties in the port city of Inchon, which is not
 under martial law. Martial-law commander Lt. Gen. Song Yo-
 chan has ordered restrictions relaxed in Seoul and other cities
 under martial. law, and in the capital all but about 100 of the
 1,700 demonstrators seized by the police have been released.
 In the provincial capital. of Kwangju, however, there are wide-
 spread rumors that some 600 students still held by the author-
 ities are being tortured, and the city appears "cowed rather than
 quiet:' Although army troops fired on student demonstrators on
 21 April, the people of Kwangju reportedly tend to regard the sol-,
 diers as "moderators" between themselves and police.

 Disorder in South Korea May Spread to Taiwan
 The disorder in South Korea has increased the possibility
 of protest demonstrations over any irregularities during local
 elections on 24 April in Taiwan, where developments in Korea
 are being followed closely.  Major demonstrations on the day
 of the elections appear unlikely, but blatant election irregulari-
 ties could generate incidents such as fist fights at polling sta-
 tions. Defeat of any of several independent candidates by a
 narrow margin in one of the hotly contested races could incite
 open accusations that the elections were rigged in favor of the
 Kuomintang candidate.
 Yang Chiu-hu, a member of the opposition Democratic So-
 cialist party, petitioned President Chiang Kai-shek at a recent
 session of the National Assembly to require the ruling Kuomintang
 party to clean up elections on Taiwan. Independent Taiwanese
 politicians and newspapers also have criticized the Kuomintang
 for election irregularities- -such as ballot-box stuffing, plural
 voting, and. unfair invalidation of ballots--and requested that op-
 position as well as Kuomintang candidates be allowed to appoint
 poll supervisors.  Government and Kuomintang officials have re-
 jected this demand.
 The Kuomintang wants to display overwhelming popular sup-
 port by winning a majority of the contests, but it is anxious to
 avoid a shutout of minority representation.  The party has re-
 frained from nominating a full slate of candidates and in some
 contests surreptitiously supports independent candidates to
 foster a facade of oppositions  Local party officials, however,
 are conscious of the adverse effect independent representation
 might have on their political careers and may ignore party
 orders to avoid any actions which might give rise to demonstra-
 tions.

 Japanese Demonstrations Against Security Treaty With US
 The nationwide leftist campaign against ratification of the
 US-Japanese security treaty is likely to be exploited by ex-
 tremists, who are planning a student-led violent demonstra-
 tion in front of the Diet on 26 April, about the time the lower
 house plans to put the treaty to a vote.  The opposition So-
 cialists, who already have halted committee hearings on the
 treaty by preventing the chairman from taking his seat, may
 also resort to nonparliamentary action to delay or even pre-
 vent a floor vote.
 Some 30,000 members of Zengakuren, the radical uni-
 versity students' association, are planning to exploit the
 demonstration already scheduled by 70-80,000 members of
 organizations participating in the leftist -sponsored People's
 Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty.  Zengakuren
 leaders--many of whom have been expelled from the Japanese
 Communist party for extremism, including the precipitation
 of a riot at the Tokyo airport when Prime Minister Kishi
 departed for Washington last January to sign the new treaty--
 have rejected the council's program as "too passive and in-
 effective."
 Government leaders are concerned that Zengakuren,
 prompted by the student riots in. South Korea, may resort to
 its most violent action to date. Accordingly, they plan to
 mobilize 10,000 police equipped with tear gas to cope with
 the situation. In the final analysis, however, leftist ex-
 tremism, while possibly upsetting the treaty ratification sched-
 ule, will antagonize the general Japanese public and probably
 prove counterproductive by undercutting opposition to the treaty.

 Split Developing in Dome  n South  ric    arty
 LA_ serious split has apparently developed within South Af-
 rica's ruling Nationalist party over the question of the govern-
 ment's future racial policy. A relatively moderate faction of
 the. cabinet, led by acting chairman Paul Sauer and Minister
 of. Posts, Telegraphs, and Health Albert Hertzog, has reported-
 ly been exploring ways of easing racial tension by applying
 the apartheid policy less harshly.  These efforts were reflected
 in Sauer's 19 April call for. "an important change in the practi-
 cal application of government policy," involving revision. of the
 stringent native pass laws, higher wages for urban Africans,
 and increased interracial contac
 [Sauer has been publicly rebuked by External Affairs Min-
 ister Eric Louw and Minister of Bantu Administration M. D. C.
 de Wet Nel, the spokesmen for the. conservative Nationalists.
 Louw told Parliament on 20 April that the government's policy
 "remains unchanged" and that changes could be made only by
 Verwoerd. Sauer's speech was also criticized by the Nation-
 alist newspaper Die Vaderland, whose board of directors in-
 cludes Hertzog and three other cabinet members. Die Vader-
 land's criticism may indicate that the other members of the
 merate faction in the cabinet are hesitant to give public sup-
 port to Sauer's proposals as a result of the ne-gative party re-
 action to them.

 Guinea Regime Reported Moving Against Opposition
 President Sekou Tours and the influential left wing of Guinea's
 authoritarian regime are taking vigorous measures to suppress
 elements which have recently moved to establish a rival political
 party.
 Toure's militant and highly disciplined Democratic party of Guinea
 has been the sole political organization and the real governing
 authority in the country since shortly after Guinea voted for inde-
 pendence from France in September 1958.
 The opposition movement, which reportedly is headed by Jus-
 tice Minister Ibrahima Barry and includes several other ministers,
 appears inspired in large part by the traditional hostility of the
 hinterland Foulah tribe toward the Malinke and Soussous tribesmen
 who predominate in Toure's regime. Rumors of increasing unrest
 among the Foulahs have been circulating in Guinea since late 1959.
 In the last few days, these have become more specific in nature,
 pointing to an early attempt by Barry to establish an opposition
 party pledged to moderating the regime's strongly socialist-oriented
 internal policies and reversing its drift toward the Soviet bloc. The
 opposition group reportedly favors the establishment of "Common-
 wealth ties" with France.
 There appears little likelihood that Tours and his group, who
 are believed to be in firm control of the security apparatus, will
 be overturned in the near future. Repressive action, including
 house-to-house searches for antiregime propaganda and the arrest
 of one minister-not Barry-and many second-echelon opposition
 leaders, reportedly began on 19 April. However, a desire not to
 reveal publicly the extent of the split within the government may
 influence Tours to move against other top opposition leaders one
 by one rather than to arrest them all now.
