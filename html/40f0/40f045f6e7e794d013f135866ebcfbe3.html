 Chinese Communists Accused of Exploiting Situation in Ken  :  Jomo Kenyatta,
 o   au Mau fame an now President of       (Kenya African National Union),
 has sent an emissary with a letter of complaint to another point in Africa
 (probably Dar Es Salaam in Tanganyika) addressed to Chinese Diplomatic
 officials.  Kenyatta allegedly says that he has received reports that Kenyan and
 other East African students in China are poorly treated, ill-housed, ill-fed,
 denied freedom of movement, and that they are taught only ideological subjects
 rather than those they had come to mainland China to study.  The emissary has
 b en instructed, if he does not receive a satisfactory reply from the Chinese
 ili.alomats, himself to arrange to proceed to Red China, to observe the situation
 and report back to Kenyatta.
 On 3 January the Vice-President of another Kenyan political party, KAD?.T
 (Kenya African Democratic Union), characterized communism as the "greatest
 single threat to an emergent African nation." He also said that the Communists
 buy the individual with money and replace all forms of human dignity with the
 myth of a Communist God. " He predicted that "once the British forces leave
 Kenya we will have the Communist onslaught upon us....  In Kenya," and added,
 "that independence for which we fought will be of no use when we are stooges
 and quislings to the Communist world. " Specifically, he accused Kenyan
 politician Oginga Odinga (as others before him have done), of being the recipient
 of large sums of money from the Communist bloc.  Communist China has
 frequently been named as the donor.  Odinga merely denies that he has been
 receiving moneys regularly.  He admits that he has accepted some money in the
 past when it was needed for what he calls "very legitimate purposes. 11
 Soviet Scientists Note Failures in USSR Training: Press Comment, 13 February
 1962 i reproduced from the Current  i est o the Soviet Press   1 Jan 62) a
 translation of an article byte noted Soviet physicist, Igor  evgenyevich Tamm,
 which originally appeared in Izvesti a. It was concerned with finding and training
 first-class research scientists. Several features of this article call for attention
 In the first place, Tamm indicates that the Soviet Union is not doing a satisfactory
 job of finding and training youzgscientists.  Instead of inspiring and training your;
 scientists, many of the best scientists are isolated in research institutes (i.e. in institutes performing defense research, etc.), while the scientific education
 of future physicists and mathematicians is interrupted by (Khrushchev's) require-
 meas that they do ordinary production work.                   (The ideological argument for
 menial "productive work," as necessary for- cultivating communist attitudes and
 discipline, was repeated on 25 December 1961 by CPSU Secretary flyichev) In
 the second place, Tainm's article indicates great respect for western science,
 both for individuals like Einstein (who for years was an infidel idealist in Soviet
 eyes) and for institutions like MIT and Caltech; he emphasizes the importance
 of a scientific project by saying that it was this that he spoke about in the U. S. A.
 We can use Tamm's statements to show not onS.y that Soviet education fails to
 develop thinking individuals schooled in the humanities (see Guil7.nce #491),
 huc also that Communist doctrine interferes with scientific training,, and that
 eminent Soviet scientists recognize the strength and vitality of western science.

 490.  Khrushchev, The Amateur Agronomist, Issues Orders to Farmers    25X1 C10b
 Background:  On 5 March Nikita Khrushchev is expected to address the
 Centro   ommi tee of the CPSU on the shortcomings of Soviet agriculture
 and to make proposals for its improvement.  The meeting will be the first of
 the enlarged 330 member Central Committee named at the 22nd CPSU Congress
 last fall. The subject of the March meeting of the Central Committee -
 overtly, at any rate - will apparently center on this perennial problem. Since
 the 22nd CPSU Congress, Khrushchev has been touring agricultural areas in
 the USSR threatening and cajoling farmers in an effort to achieve sorely
 needed productivity.  He denounced the allegedly outmoded Soviet cropping
 system known as the grass field (travopol e) rotation system.  Exponents of
 this system, he said in Moscow on     ecember, become
 "like priests who have no proof of God but require people to
 believe in his existence.  ... Ordinary people on collective
 and state farms produce more grain, meat and milk than is
 produced by experimental units that follow the prescriptions
 of such scientists.  Excuse my crudeness, but how can one
 help saying 'What the hell do people want with this sort of
 science ? "'(Animation in the hall; applause)  ... "Scientists
 have spoken here.    They all listened attentively to the advice
 of Academician Lysenko... but among the speakers there were
 unfortunate scientists of whom one would like to say: 'Don't
 discredit the good name of science; don't put science to shame.
 (Applause) "We would like to say to such people: 'How is it
 that you, a scientist, a Doctor of Sciences, consider that you
 are conducting your business on the basis of scientific data
 when you buy fodder for your cattle in the experimental
 institute from the State?' Where is the Party's leadership
 in agriculture ?  For seven years Comrade Zaporozhets, a
 Communist, has been the director of this farm" (in Leningrad
 Oblast).  "I do not know whether such a manager can be
 called a Communist.  For you, Comrade Zaporozhets, next
 year should be your graduation year.  Either you retain your
 Party ticket or you will have to hand it in and stop considering
 yourself a Communist. If you fail to reorganize your t anage-
 ment and do not make sure that land is efficiently used, you
 will put yourself outside the ranks of the Party. "
 The strong emphasis of the Soviet agricultural programs on incorporating
 grass in the rotation system as a soil-improving crop follows the teachings
 of a Russian soil scientist of Welsh extraction, V. R. Williams, Professor
 Williams insisted that, in order to have the best possible effect on the soil and
 crop yields, the sod crop must consist of a mixture of legumes (e. g. peas, beans)
 and grasses.  Where perennial grasses did not grow well, as on sandy soils, it
 was recommended that crops such as lupine be grown for green manuring - for
 plowing under as a fertilizer.  But the efforts of the Soviet government to intro-duce of feAr      aa;;dOrf  ve encq}}l}~~~ter~be ti f/4.d6I1D(Fage

 often responsible for failures in crop rotation by prescribing crop goals
 inconsistent with the observance of the crop rotation cycle, often of 7 to 10 years
 duration.  Khrushchev has been denouncing those he regards as the wrong kind
 of scientists (he admires Lysenko, who is discredited among most Western and
 even some Soviet biologists) and has been urging drastic curtailment of the
 practice of leaving land fallow to regain essential nutrients and mositure after
 it has been planted to crops that deplete these resources.  In the short run, this
 device may perhaps bring a sharp increase in production and Khrushchev would
 then have some fine statistical figure to prove the correctness of his agricultural
 theories.  However, these results would probably be temporary and might well
 have been achieved at the cost of mining the soil and seriously depleting its fer-
 tility for the future.  Moreover, the Soviet drive to increase the proportion of
 livestock that is collectively owned runs counter to the fact that one third of
 Soviet livestock is still in private hands and is pastured on the land given over
 to grasses.  Thus members of collective farms have a vested interest in the
 preservation of the grasslands.
 At the root of the Soviet farm problem - as elswhere in the Communist
 bloc - is the inability to provide the strong incentive for collective and state
 farmers that individual farmers have, for instance, in many countries of the
 non-Communist world.  The typical farmer in the USSR or in any state working
 under the Communist system sees no reason to work very hard or to exert the
 kind of ingenuity that (to name a few examples) a C znadian or Australian wheat
 grower, a New England dairy farmer, the cultivator of a Western European
 vineyard, or an Iowa corn grower takes for granded. (If a good local example
 is available to any field station or base, it should, of course, be used.) The chronic
 shortage of fertilizer is also a constant problem.  The result is that the Commu-
 nist state is plagued by chronic food problems such as imbalance of the diet
 (e. g. the USSR) or caloric deficiency (of which Communist China has for years
 been the worst example) while in the free world there is a problem, far easier
 to deal with, of food surpluses.  There is always a Communist state (again,
 for instance, China) desperately anxious to relieve the free world of some of
 its food surpluses.                                                           25X1 C1 Ob

 491.  Education in the U. S.S. R1.
 Back r-und:  Recently, the National Science Foundation published
 Nicholas  a  itt's exhaustive 856-page study entitled: "Education and
 Professional Employment in the U. S. U.S.S.R. '"   (Washington, U. S. Govern-
 ment Printing Office, 1961).
 M.r. DeWitt, noting that the Soviets treat education as but another tool
 in their pursuit of world-wide power, says:
 "Over the last four decades in the Soviet Union neither education
 nor research has been an ivory tower, isolated from society.  Soviet
 education, from preschool to research traiz!~. ~.   or advanced ..de grec s,
 owes its existence to and sets its goals by the society it is called upon
 to serve. It is but a mea is to an end: to rza;".: n.LJe the economic and
 political power of the Soviet regime a-.-td to stre,hgther thereby its
 international position in the struggle to establish communism through-
 out the world........ .
 "The development of Soviet education and specialized manpower
 resources--should be viewed mainly in the context of total Communist
 advances - political, economic, social and cultural......... Soviet
 education derives its strength and, by the same token, its weaknesses,
 from the fact that it is centrally planned and directed by the state,
 which imposes norms of conformity upon the individual... "
 The nature of Soviet education is characterized as follows:
 "In the Soviet Union a high premium is placed upon technical and
 specialized, rather than general, excellence.  Science and technology
 are particularly recognized as the foundation of national strength, and
 consequently they receive emphasis on all levels of the educational
 effort....  The quality of Soviet professional training in scientific,
 engineering and applied fields today is, on substantial grounds,
 comparable to that offered in the West.  This is not true, however,
 in all fields - especially where political ii.tervention is heavily felt
 or where exclusively applied objectives prevail.'"
 A major limiting factor in Soviet education, which may prove to be a
 serious handicap in the long run, is phrased in the following terns.
 s
 "Soviet gains in developing speci lized professional manpower,
 however, have been made at the exile se of broad. higher educational
 opportunities in other areas - the a s, humanities and social
 sciences.  While the utility of a technical specialist to society is
 undeniable, the preparation of the Soviet specialist, with his lack
 of humanistic education and disregard for the cultural, ethical and
 social valuer, cherished by the Wflest, limits him in participating in
 the s lution of the important social and political problems which
 divide the Soviet Union and the democratic world today.

 "In Soviet higher education, the development of professional
 competence and technical rationality is divorced, perhaps quite
 deliberately, from the a:quisiltlon of broad humanistic values, a
 fact which makes the Sov et professional a tool, witting or unwitting,
 in serving the aims of the Communist regime.  Soviet higher
 education succeeds in developing the human mind to the point of
 high competence in many areas, but deprives it of its potential to
 exercise independent and creative thought in the sphere of social
 values.  If the aim of education is to develop a creative intellect
 critical of society and its values, then Soviet higher education is an
 obvious failure.  If its aim is to develop applied professional skills
 enabling the individual to perform specialized, functional tasks, then
 Soviet higher education is unquestionably a success, posing not only
 a temporary challenge, but a major threat in the long-run struggle
 between democracy and totalitarianism. "
 The study reports that the total education base in the Soviet Union is still
 far below that of the United States, with the median number of years of
 completed schooling put at four in Russia, compared with eleven in the
 United States.  In 1958 the USSR adopted a much discussed and publicized
 School Reform bill in which universal education for children was to be
 extended to 10 years.  A. short three years later we find that the majority
 of Soviet youths will be pressed into the labor force with substantially less
 schooling than the standards call for, namely eight years instead of ten.
 Further, the number who are now being allowed to proceed into college is
 only ten out of every one hundred who enter elementary school.  In 1959,
 higher education in the Soviet Union (with a population 50 million larger
 than that of the United States) had 2,200,000 students, as compared to
 3,600,000 in the United States.                                                25X1 C1 Ob

 492.  Khrushchev, Kirov
 25X1C10b
 Background:  Any move to relax long-standing totalitarian controls very
 soon raises a problem: where is the new line to be drawn between that which is
 permitted and that which is not? Once reform has be gun, it is hard to stop.
 History is full of cases in which an absolute leader, by sharing his responsibilities
 for the sake of short-term goals, or to meet relatively minor emergencies,
 has quickly lost all control of the situation: Charles I found that the Long
 Parliament, which he summoned in 1640, was more powerful than he was;
 Louis XVI had a similar experience with the Estates General in 1789; and
 Napoleon III began to lose control when he adopted (1868) the policy of the
 "Liberal Empire. " No doubt Khrushchev, is aware of this danger, as he had
 not permittedany real change in the organization of Soviet power; he has not
 permitted any real discussion within the CPSU.  While intra-party factional
 discussion is not the same as discussion between several democratically-based
 (i.e., democratically elected) parties, it may well lead to open competition for
 political support outside the Communist party apparatu.s.  With all reservations
 as to Leon Trotsky's own ultimate aims, Trotskyism represented the most
 serious demand in Soviet party history for the right to differ with the party
 leadership, and the right to argue for changes in party policy.  If Khrushchev
 now admitted that Trotsky had a right to differ with Stalin, he would also
 implicitly admit that party members today have a right to differ with him.
 Trotsky was not, of course, a liberal democrat.  The best two-word
 epithet for him would be,  "romantic revolutionary. " During his career as a
 Communist, Trotsky was always the spokesman for revolutionary action,
 regardless of doctrinal or practical obstacles.  Trotsky concluded, before
 Lenin did, that it was not necessary to wait for Russia to pass through the Marx-
 ian stage of capitalism; Russia could move immediately from Czarism to
 Socialism, providing that the revolution was spread throughout the world.  Much
 of the time, Trotsky was at odds with orthodox Bolshevism; in one sense, he
 deviated to the left, while in another respect he deviated to the right.
 a.  Trotsky was a left deviationist in that he tended to over-estimate
 the prospects for immediate, international revolution, and to press
 (before others wished to do so) for radical reorganization and national-
 ization of the economy, under the policy of "primitive socialist
 accumulation. "  This policy, adopted later by Stalin, and still later
 by Mao Tse-tung, meant forcing peasants to surrender their products
 without real compensation; these products would serve to feed
 industrial workers who were producing goods (machine tools, arms,
 dams, steel mills, etc.) which the peasant could not purchase, and
 which were of no value to him.  Trotsky's doctrine of "Permanent
 Revolution" -- I. e. , continuous. revolution the world over -- was also
 a left deviation after Lenin gave it up as impractical.

 49Z . (Cont.)                                                  12 February 1962
 when he was in control himself.  He reinstituted discipline in the
 army, directed the suppression of the Kronstadt Rebellion, argued
 for the elimination of any free trade union activity, and voted for
 the expulsion of the "Worker's Opposition" from the party.)
 Once he had spread the idea that Trotsky was an enemy of the party, Stalin
 used the "amalgam" technique to attack others by calling them Trotskyites.  When
 the break occurred with Tito in 1948, Tito was called a Trotskyite.  The leading
 figures in the trials in the 1930's, such as Kamenev, Zinoviev, and Bukharin,
 were alleged to have conspired with Trotsky.  Supposedly, the first object of
 their conspiracy was the assassination of the leader of the Leningrad party
 organization, S. M. Kirov, which took place 'on 1 December 1934.
 Actually, most students of Soviet history now believe that Stalin himself
 ordered Kirov's murder, thereby ridding himself of a subordinate who seemed
 too popular and too independent-minded, as well as creating a pretext for the
 Judicial murder of the old Bolshevik leadership.  Some of these students, such
 as George Kennan, believe that the murder and subsequent trials were partly
 inspired by the example of Hitler's successful purge, conducted on 30 June 1934.
 Khrushchev himself, while not explicitly accusing Stalin of having murdered
 Kirov, has strongly implied as much.  (See Attachment) But although Khrushchev
 has made disclosures, his investigation has not progressed very far in the five
 and a half years that elapsed between the 20th and 22nd Congresses.
 Probably one reason for this lack of progress is that Khrushchev's own
 innocence might become suspect if too much were known about the Kirov case.
 We do know that Khrushchev, despite his recent criticism of the purges and of
 'illegality, U and despite his suggestion in his 27 October 1961 speech that
 "Perhaps we should erect a monument in Moscow to perpetuate the memory of
 comrades who fell victim to arbitrary rule," himself did everything to further
 the atmosphere of hysteria that prevailed in the purge era.  (See Attachment)
 We know that Khrushchev was in Leningrad on the day Kirov's bodyguard "died
 in an accident;" he and Bulganin were two members of the official six-man
 Kirov funeral commission.  Three other members of this commission are
 known to have died or disappeared in 1937, at the time when the NKVD men who
 knew too much were being eliminated.  Without going to any other witnesses,
 or collecting any further evidence, Nikita Khrushchev himself could tell much
 more about the Kirov case -- if he wanted to.
 Another reason for the lack of progress in the clarification of the Kirov
 case and of the purges generally is the danger (see 1st para. above) that a
 rehabilitation of Trotsky would weaken Khrushchev's control of the party.  In
 his 1956 secret speech, Khr.ushchev conceded that it had been necessary to
 annihilate those who had broken with Trotskyism "and returned to Leninist
 positions. 't But he also stated that Stalin had "played a positive role" in the
 "ideological fight" against the Trotskyites and others "who proposed anti-
 Leninist theses, who represented P. political line hostile to the Party and to the
 cause of socialism. "  Curiously, Khrushchev's 27 October 1961 speech, which
 in many respects repeated the 1956 secret speech, made no reference of any
 kind to Trotsky and Trotskyism.  But in November, Konstantinov, the editor
 of the Soviet theoretical journal Kommunist, accused the Albanian CP of holding
 the Trotskyite view that rewolutioncaane imposed from outside a country;
 ~t}his view was also attributed to the Chinese Communist leaders.

 Prague conference of the old Russian Social Democratic Labor Party.  This
 article protrayed Lenin as the fighter for party solidarity against the disruptive
 forces on the right and left wings -- including the Trotskyites -- and against
 the indifference of Stalin. Pospelov's account suggested an analogy between
 the deviant Menshevik-Left radical-Trotskyite forces of 1912 and the Chinese-
 Albanian and Yugoslav factions of today. (Actually, Lenin's Prague conference
 was a rump meeting of Bolsheviks, and Trotsky and Plekhauov, the old leader
 of the RSDLP, boycotted the meeting because it was one-sided and threatened
 Social Democratic unity.)
 TheTrotskyites of today have not overlooked the questions which have
 been raised by Khrushchev's disclosures on the murder of Kirov.  At the end
 of the 22nd CPSU Congress (perhaps encouraged by the lack of attack on
 Trotskyism at that Congress),
 Mme. Natalia Sedov, Trotsky's widow (since
 deceased), sent Khrushchev the following message:
 You have just disclosed the provocation committed by Stalin
 against the old Bolsheviks, under cover of the assassination of
 Kirov.
 I request that you undertake the total, public revision of the
 Moscow Trials, in which the primary defendants were Leon
 Trotsky and my son Leon Sedov.
 I request that you make a complete, public investigation of
 the means employed by the GPU against Trotsky and of the
 assassination of Leon Trotsky in Mexico, of the instigators and
 executors of that crime.
 I request that you inform me of the fate of my son, Sergei
 Sedov, arrested in 1935, whose sole crime was that he was the
 son of Leon Trotsky.
 I request that you publish in the Russian language the com-
 plete works of Leon Trotsky  which were begun in Lenin's time,
 and of which 22 volumes had already been published before Stalin
 proscribed them, and before Stalin made his falsifications.
 During the period of the purge trials, unofficial commissions were
 formed in various countries to review the evidence of Trotsky's guilt.  The
 most famous and important of these commissions was headed by John Dewey,
 the well-known American philosopher and educational theorist. On the basis
 of the evidence that could be collected then in Mexico and the U. S. A. , the
 Dewey Commission concluded that the Moscow trials were frame-ups and that
 Trotsky and Sedov were not guilty of the charges made.  The Commission's
 conclusions were convincing then; they are much more so today.  (For a full
 description of the Dewey investigations, those able to obtain them should see

 respectively.    a  e.?,v-'7ork Times  urila  Magazine of 28 January 1962 contaimd
