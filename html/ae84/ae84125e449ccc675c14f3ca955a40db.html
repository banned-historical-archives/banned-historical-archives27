 Italian Prime Minister Andreotti has
 made a further compromise with the
 Communists on the formulation of
 economic policy by agreeing to formal
 bilateral consultations with them and the
 leaders of other parties on additional
 economic austerity measures.
 The concession by Andreotti prompted
 the postponement of the cabinet meeting
 that had been slated to discuss the
 economic program in preparation for the
 parliamentary debate next week.
 Communist Party chief Berlinguer had
 proposed last week that the government
 meet in a conference with all nongovern-
 ment parties, except the neo-fascist and
 Q P 1
 left-wing splinter parties, to discuss the
 proposed austerity program, which
 Berlinguer termed inadequate. The Chris-
 tian Democrats rejected Berlinguer's for-
 mula-which would have been a long step
 toward the "emergency government" ad-
 vocated by the Communists and
 Socialists-but the Prime Minister has
 sought to soften his party's action by
 offering to meet formally with the Com-
 munists.
 The arrangement allows the Com-
 munists to present a victory of sorts to
 their rank-and-file, who continue to ques-
 tion whether the party is getting enough in
 return for its present cooperation with the
 government. This concession is not likely
 to satisfy the Communists for long, and
 further demands for tangible evidence of
 their influence on the government are
 almost certain.
 The parliamentary debate on the
 austerity measures, which will begin on
 November 10, could be stormy. Two par-
 (AM
 ties are already preparing to challenge the
 economic program. The Socialists, feeling
 themselves badly outmaneuvered by the
 Communists, reportedly are preparing to
 submit their own alternative austerity
 program during the debate. The fiscally
 conservative Republicans apparently plan
 to offer suggestions designed to frustrate
 Andreotti's efforts to tread a fine line
 between the demands of the unions and
 those of the non-communist parties that
 continue to support
 through    their
 his government
 abstentions.

 FRANCE - WEST GERMANY
 France plans to reduce the number of
 its troops in West Germany from 60,000
 to 46,000, according to the US embassy in
 Bonn. French officials reportedly told the
 Germans that the withdrawals will be
 spread over the next two years and will be
 part of the overall reorganization of the
 French army.
 A senior West German military official
 told the US embassy in Bonn that about
 5,000 men will return to France this year
 as three artillery regiments are
 withdrawn. Two of these regiments will be
 re-equipped with Pluton tactical nuclear
 missiles and reassigned to units in
 northeastern France.
 The other 9,000 men will return to
 France over the next two years as part of
 France's program to reorganize its 5 ac-
 tive divisions into 16 smaller divisions
 equipped with additional medium tanks
 and armored vehicles. The program, an-
 nounced this spring, calls for a slight
 reduction in the size of the army and the
 elimination of some intermediate levels of
 command. The reorganization is designed
 to improve command and control of
 French forces and probably will enhance
 their mobility.
 French and West German officials have
 been discussing the reductions since early
 this year, but the French only recently
 confirmed German estimates of how
 many troops are to be withdrawn. The

 French have assured the Germans that
 France's combat capability in West Ger-
 many would be unimpaired and would
 even be improved because a smaller, more
 mobile force will be better able to respond
 to a conventional threat and be more
 effective in combat.
 The French government has denied
 press reports linking the reductions with a
 desire to emphasize France's nonpar-
 ticipation in the force reduction talks in
 Vienna.
 French attaches in Bonn told the US
 defense attache in August that France was
 considering an increase in the number of
 its divisions in Germany from two to
 three. The restructuring of French forces
 and the elimination of the intermediate
 commands will enable France to station
 three smaller divisions across the Rhine
 while reducing the number of troops
 NORWAY-USSR
 The agreement last month by Norway
 and the USSR on a 10-year reciprocal
 fishing pact has raised hopes in Oslo for
 progress in talks later this year on the dis-
 pute over a demarcation line in the
 Barents Sea. The Soviets, however, show
 no sign of relaxing their position on issues
 relating to Norwegian administration of
 Svalbard. Last month, they accused
 Norway of violating the demilitarization
 provisions of the 1920 treaty that gave
 Norway sovereignty over the archipelago.
 The fishing agreement does not include
 Soviet endorsement of the 200-mile
 economic zone Norway plans to declare
 on January 1, 1977, nor does it set an an-
 nual fishing quota. The Norwegians
 assert, somewhat lamely, that they did not
 ask for Soviet endorsement of the
 economic zone, and that the preamble of
 the agreement, in any case, implies de fac-
 to recognition.
 Norway had hoped to settle the demar-
 cation line issue before the fishing agree-
 ment, but the Soviets balked during the
 last round of talks in June. Norway was
 prepared to compromise on its proposal
 for a median line zigzagging between each
 country's Arctic islands, but the Soviets
 did not budge from their position favor-
 ing a straight sector line. The Soviets
 have underscored their position many
 times by firing missiles into the disputed
 area, an action they repeated earlier this
 week.
 On Svalbard, where the Soviet colony
 ignores the Norwegian administration,
 the Soviets recently brought in five large,
 assault-type  helicopters  without  re-
 questing Norwegian permission. When
 Oslo protested, Izvestia charged Norway
 had violated the 1920 treaty by permitting
 its naval ships to visit Svalbard and
 by allowing military aircraft to land
 there.
 Norway admitted that its military ships
 and planes had visited the islands since
 1925, but denied that this violated the
 treaty. As Svalbard has no year-round
 commercial transportation links, military
 connections often provide the only contact
 the small Norwegian community has with
 the mainland. The Soviet charge,
 nevertheless, increases pressure on
 Norway and probably reflects Soviet
 determination to resist Norwegian inten-
 tions to promote economic development
 on Svalbard and adjacent off-shore areas
 in the far north.
 NATO
 NATO representatives have begun the
 search for agreement among themselves
 on how to approach the conference in
 Belgrade next summer that will review
 implementation of the Helsinki agree-
 ment on security and cooperation in
 Europe. The allies agreed to press for a
 "full and candid" assessment of the East's
 record of compliance. At the same time,
 they made clear their belief that US stan-
 dards for measuring the East's perfor-
 mance are too rigid.
 Western governments view recent
 domestic dissatisfaction with detente,
 coupled with the East's marginal record
 of compliance, as requiring a candid look
 at how the agreement is being im-
 plemented.
 The allies expect the East, for its part,
 to try to play down the Belgrade con-
 ference and to make countercharges of
 its own. Accordingly, the allied represen-
 tatives agreed that the West should seek
 to focus the conference on the East's
 deficiencies,   while   presenting   new
 proposals to enable the West to retain
 the initiative.
 While the Europeans agree that nothing
 should be done to alter the Helsinki agree-
 ment, they have nonetheless been trying
 since last spring to differentiate their   25X1
 stance from what they see as the US "all
 or nothing" approach to Eastern com-
 pliance.
 The Europeans disagree with the view
 that communist initiatives should be re-
 jected out of hand until the compliance
 record of the East improves. This is a
 reflection of the desire of the Europeans
 to maintain their independence in the face
 of what they view as a cooling of relations
 between the super powers and their deter-
 mination to make the most of Soviet in-
 terest in expanding the dialogue with the
 West.
 A report on allied preparations for the
 Belgrade conference will be presented to
 the NATO foreign ministers next month,
 and detailed preparations for the Belgrade
 meeting will continue through next spring.

 vehicle of party head Sa Carneiro, the top
 leadership was expanded, and Sa
 Carneiro moved   from   the
 secretary-generalship  to the party
 presidency. He will continue to dominate
 the party, but the shift will help to mollify
 party liberals and keep them from drifting
 toward the Socialists.
 Portugal's two largest parties, the rul-
 ing Socialists and the Social
 Democrats-formerly the Popular
 Democrats-held party congresses last
 week.
 The Socialists remain troubled by fac-
 tionalism. An outright split between
 leftists and rightists was avoided, but the
 leftists did resist Prime Minister Soares'
 efforts to present a single slate for the
 151-man national committee. The leftist
 slate made a strong showing and picked
 up one third of the committee positions.
 By this action, the left wing has es-
 tablished itself as a force to be reckoned
 with, although it is still too weak directly
 to challenge the party's mainstream.
 Shortly after the congress, the
 long-rumored resignation of leftist
 Agriculture Minister Lopes Cardoso, who
 led the effort to set up the separate slate,
 was announced. Other leftist leaders may
 be maneuvered out of positions on the
 party secretariat..
 The Social Democrats, in contrast,
 emerged from their congress a stronger
 and more unified party. In an effort to
 make the party more than the personal
 USSR
 The Soviet news agency Tass an-
 nounced on October 12 that General
 Anatoly Gribkov has been appointed chief
 of staff of the Warsaw Pact forces, filling
 the position left vacant by the death of
 Army General Shtemenko last April.
 Gribkov will serve as a deputy to War-
 saw Pact Commander Yakubovsky, who
 is said to be seriously ill, and will probably
 fill in for the commander when necessary.
 If past practice is followed, Gribkov will
 also be a first deputy chief of the General
 Staff of the Soviet Armed Forces.
 The delay in naming Shtemenko's
 successor may indicate difficulty in find-
 ing someone with the proper military
 qualifications who was also politically
 acceptable.
 Some Pact members probably pressed
 for an East European officer for the posi-
 tion. The recent "Shield-76" exercise in
 Poland may have given Defense Minister
 Ustinov an opportunity to discuss the
 issue with  Pact representatives and
 perhaps settle Gribkov's nomination.
 The 57-year-old Gribkov served as a
 major in the corps of General Staff of-
 ficers who were sent to field units as
 representatives of the General Staff dur-
 ing World War II. He was elected to the
 Supreme Soviet of Armenia in 1967.
 Since 1973, Gribkov has commanded the
 key Leningrad Military District. In June,
 he directed the much publicized exercise
 "Sever"-the second Soviet exercise an-
 nounced in compliance with the Helsinki
 accords. Late last month, Gribkov was
 promoted to General of the Army.

 During the 25th Party Congress earlier
 this year, Gribkov was elected a can-
 didate-member of the Central Com-
 mittee.
 EAST GERMANY
 In a major shake-up last week, East
 German party leader Erich Honecker
 assumed the position of head of state,
 further strengthening his pre-eminent
 status in the political hierarchy.
 Prime Minister Horst Sindermann was
 replaced by Willi Stoph, the head of state
 since 1973. Sindermann was given the
 largely ceremonial post of president of
 parliament.
 Honecker's predecessor, Walter
 Ulbricht, also held both the leading party
 and state positions. Honecker can also
 cite the examples of his East European
 colleagues who, with the exception of
 Hungary's Kadar and Poland's Gierek,
 also hold both posts.
 Sindermann's dismissal seems to stem
 in part from East Germany's vexing
 economic problems. As the coordinator
 of the regime's vast administrative struc-

 ture, Sindermann had considerable in-
 fluence in the economic bureaucracy.
 Both Honecker and Stoph spoke critically
 last week of the performance of ministries
 in the economic sphere.
 Stoph was prime minister from 1964 to
 1973 and has served more than 20 years in
 high levels of both the party and the
 government. He has a reputation as an
 effective and conscientious party
 pragmatist. He has been in poor health
 for several years, however, and his ap-
 pointment may be only temporary.
 An exchange of jobs by two of East
 Germany's top economic officials just
 after the leadership shake-up strengthens
 party control over the implementation of
 economic policies.
 Guenter Mittag stepped down as first
 deputy chairman of the Council of
 Ministers and returned to the far more
 powerful post of party secretary for
 economic affairs-a job he held from
 1963 to  1973. Mittag has long been
 acknowledged as the party's economic
 wizard. He is a prominent member of the
 group of younger technocrats that
 spearheaded East Germany's efforts to
 modernize industrial production and
 decentralize planning and administration.
 Mittag's replacement on the Council of
 Ministers is Werner Krolikowski, who
 held the party secretariat position for
 economics after Mittag's departure three
 years ago.  As party economic boss,
 Krolikowski was a tough taskmaster, but
 he probably lacked Mittag's broader
 managerial skills and energy, which ap-
 parently are now called for.
 Both men retain their policy-making
 posts on the Politburo, where party chief
 Honecker may well want to take advan-
 tage of Krolikowski's tough approach to
 the resolution of conflicting economic in-

 CHINA
 The Chinese leadership issued a state-
 ment on November 2 that seemed design-
 ed to reassure both domestic and foreign
 audiences that recent changes in China do
 not signal a sudden break in policies at
 home or abroad.
 On the domestic front, the statement
 may have meant to reassure those who
 sympathized to some degree with the
 ideology of the four fallen leftist leaders
 that the Maoist vision of a revolutionary
 society will not be abandoned. The state-
 ment, however, made no reference to two
 pet projects of the left-the need to
 preserve the policies of the; yultural
 revolution and the cAmpaign y(o,3eriticize
 former vice premier Teng Hsiao-ping.
 In the international sphere, the state-
 ment implied that current Chinese foreign
 policy is immutable. This seemed design-
 ed to scotch speculation that Chinese
 policy toward the USSR is now subject to
 change.
 The statement, however, may have
 signaled some modification of China's at-
 titude toward the Marxist-Leninist
 splinter groups that were sponsored by
 China in the early 1960s as a way to
 counter Soviet international influence.
 China lost interest in these groups in 1971,
 but the statement suggested Peking may
 now be prepared to resume its paternal
 relationship with them. If so, this may
 mean that the current Chinese leadership
 is somewhat skeptical as to the degree it
 can rely on the US connection to offset
 what it sees as worldwide Soviet pressure
 against China.
 Recent events have given the leadership
 a number of personnel assignments to
 make. An official Chinese spokesman
 denied that Peking has named a new
 premier, a new de facto head of state, or a
 new defense minister. Assignments to
 some of these posts may be under con-
 sideration, but it appears that no firm
 decisions have yet been made.
 The regime has moved decisively,
 however, to fill the leadership vacuum in
 the leftist stronghold of Shanghai. The
 top three positions there were held by
 three of the four fallen leftists on the
 Politburo. Two alternate members of the
 Politburo and the party boss of a
 neighboring province have been sent to
 Shanghai to take overthe top city jobs.
 NORTH KOREA    c    '
 The North Korean regime is trying to
 limit the damage from the recent highly
 publicized',~'expulsions of its diplomats
 from the Nordic countries for trafficking
 in drugs, duty-free liquor, and cigarettes.
 Since the issue came to the surface in
 mid-October, North Korea has:
 ? Acknowledged  privately  that
 some of its representatives were engag-
 ed in illegal activities.
 ? Withdrawn   ambassadors   and
 staff members as requested without a
 major public protest-an implicit ad-
 mission of guilt.
 ? Avoided  any retaliatory acts
 against  Scandinavian  officials      in
 Pyongyang.
 ? Moved quickly to replace the
 ousted diplomats.
 The North Koreans are anxious to
 forestall any move to use the smuggling
 scandal as a pretext for terminating
 several incomplete and financially troubl-
 ed industrial development projects in
 North Korea. The Danes and Japanese
 are jointly constructing a large cement
 plant, the Swedes are building an ore-
 processing facility, and the Finns have
 supplied equipment for a paper mill.
 The illegal actions in Scandinavia were
 part of a systematic effort by the North
 Koreans to exploit their diplomatic status
 for profit. Similar activities-although
 not on the same scale-have been
 reported in Burma, Nepal, Malaysia,
 Switzerland, Egypt, and Argentina.
 The illegally acquired funds are used to
 help defray operating expenses for North
 Korea's embassies and trade missions as
 well as to finance intelligence and
 propaganda activities abroad. Plagued
 with an acute shortage of foreign ex-
 change, North Korea in the past year or
 so has been cutting back some of its larger
 overseas staffs in an apparent effort to
 reduce expenses.
 So far, none of the countries in which
 North Korea abused its diplomatic
 privileges has indicated it will break
 diplomatic relations. The Scandinavian
 countries, for example, all have noted that
 they do not wish the expulsions to disrupt
 relations with Pyongyang further, and
 none of them has yet ordered the closure
 of a North Korean mission

 On November 2, Prime Minister
 Gandhi's large majority in the lower
 house of Parliament cleared the way for
 creating a permanent basis for the un-
 precedented power she now holds. The up-
 per house and at least half of the 22 state

 broad constitutional amendment, but the
 party's majority in the upper house and its
 control of most state governments make
 these steps assured.
 The amendment

 parliamentary majority if an election was
 held next year. Gandhi, however, ap-

 and to deal with such matters as scattered
 opposition to the government's family
 planning program, restlessness in organiz-
 ed labor, and organizational problems
 tablishes the prime minister as the
 supreme authority in the government and
 institutionalizes  many  repressive
 measures in effect since Gandhi imposed a
 national emergency in June 1975. The
 amendment sharply curtails the power of
 the judiciary to challenge legislative and
 executive actions and to safeguard civil
 liberties. It also enables the government
 to ban groups and activities it considers
 "antinational."
 During the next two years, Gandhi is
 authorized to make additional con-
 stitutional changes in order to remove any
 "difficulties" that stand in the way of im-
 plementing the new amendment. For
 more than a year, she has asserted that
 revisions in the 26-year-old constitution
 are needed to speed important social and
 economic changes.
 Many features of the amendment,
 however, indicate that Gandhi's chief aim
 is to retain the vast power she had-held on
 a temporary basis since June 1975. Her
 performance during a decade of rule
 suggests she is unlikely to impose any far-
 reaching policies aimed at redressing the
 basic inequities in Indian society.
 Parliamentary action on the amend-

 government announcement that the life of
 the present legislature will be extended at
 least until March  1978. The present
 term-already extended for one

 move was denounced by the opposition
 parties, most of which are boycotting the

 Lebanese President Sarkis and General
 Ghunaym, the Egyptian commander of
 the Arab League peacekeeping force,
 spent much of this week trying to work
 out arrangements for implementing the
 provisions of the cease-fire accord ap-
 proved by key Arab leaders in Riyadh last
 month. Sarkis is expected to unveil a plan
 by this weekend, but he is said to be
 pessimistic that it can be put into effect
 peacefully.

 Some additional slippage in carrying
 out the Riyadh agreement seems in-
 evitable. New contingents for the League
 force have been slow in arriving in
 Christian objections to the stationing of
 Muslim peacekeeping troops on their side
 of the cease-fire lines may have been over-
 come by a reported plan that would en-

 sudden about-face, hard-liner Camille
 Shamun joined  Phalanges  leader
 Jumayyil this week in publicly praising
 the efforts of Arab League negotiators
 and expressing optimism about the
 prospects for peace.
 If such an arrangement has been work-
 ed out, leftist leader Kamal Jumblatt can
 be expected to refuse to withdraw his
 forces from their positions unless similar
 arrangements are made for policing areas
 now under leftist control. In a transparent
 attempt to gain some leverage, Jumblatt
 this week raised new and patently im-
 possible conditions for his cooperation by
 insisting that Egyptian troops be added to
 the peacekeeping contingent and that the
 entire Arab force be restricted initially to
 between 8,000 and 10,000 men.
 Thus far, only the Palestinians have
 begun to withdraw at least in limited
 numbers from central Lebanon. A senior
 Syrian officer acknowledged this week
 that Palestinian forces were moving back
 into the Arqub region and elsewhere in

 however, does not indicate that Damascus

 northern Israel or has abandoned its ef-

 The joint statement issued following the
 talks between the Soviet and Egyptian
 foreign ministers in Sofia, Bulgaria, on
 November 3 and 4 is terse and suggests
 that both sides remain wary of each other.
 The statement notes that:
 ? The situation in the Middle East

 ? The two sides agreed to "quick

 East peace conference.
 ? They exchanged views on the pre-

 There was no sign of progress toward

 Egyptian debt to the USSR and supplying
 Egypt with Soviet military equipment.

 Burundian military officers deposed
 President  Michel Micombero  on
 November 1, a few weeks before the 10th
 anniversary of his own seizure of power in
 the former Belgian colony.
 The officers said they had taken over
 because Micombero had assumed ex-
 cessive power and had failed to address
 the country's pressing political and
 economic problems and because corrup-
 tion was rife.
 The officers set up a 29-man Supreme
 Revolutionary Council to run the country.
 The chairman of the council and new chief
 of staff of the armed forces is Colonel
 Jean Bagaza, who apparently led the
 takeover.
 Colonel Bagaza attended the Belgian
 Royal Military School in 1971 and served
 as deputy chief of staff from 1972 until the
 takeover. In that position he paid official
 visits to China and the USSR to arrange
 for limited military assistance and train-
 ing.
 Burundi, situated between Zaire and
 Tanzania, was the scene of violent tribal
 feuding in  1972 that resulted in ap-
 proximately 200,000 deaths. We see no in-
 dications that this week's change of
 government will trigger any new outburst
 The Peruvian government has again ex-
 tended the state of emergency imposed in
 July. Though Interior Minister Cisneros
 asserted that special powers are needed to

 emergency decree has been used primarily
 to clamp down on labor unrest.  On Oc-
 tober 13, the government moved against
 municipal workers who were trying to
 launch the first nationwide strike since
 June. At the same time, a police dragnet
 swept Lima's low-income neighborhoods
 to round up radicals as well as criminals.
 t A more serious challenge to the govern-
 ent was a strike by fishermen on Oc-
 tober 18, the day the second phase of the
 anchovy season was to  begin.  The
 fishermen hoped to delay denationaliza-
 tion of the fleet, which they saw as reduc-
 ing the number of jobs and eliminating
 guaranteed  salaries.  Pescaperu, the
 state-owned fishing enterprise, responded
 by revoking labor contracts and rehiring

 those fishermen who agreed to cooperate.
 This procedure allowed removal of union
 activists and reduction of the work force.
 By October 28, Pescaperu had a suf-
 ficient number of men to operate the fleet,
 but many remained on strike and the
 government sent patrols into fishermen's
 neighborhoods and imposed a curfew in
 two ports. Violence and as many as 20
 deaths have been reported as the
 fishermen attempted to enlist the support
 of other workers' groups.
 As the strike entered its third week, the
 government had lost as much as $40
 million, but its firm action seems to have
 kept the demonstrations from spreading
 to other unions. The government will con-
 tinue its tight rein under the state of
 emergency decree, and the resulting irrita-
 tion, in combination with the economic
 austerity measures and reports of pay
 raises for the military, could provoke a
 general labor protest in coming weeks.
 PERU-USSR
 A Soviet team reportedly arrived in
 Lima on October 31 to handle final details
 of the long-rumored purchase of Soviet
 fighter-bombers.
 In a press conference on November 3,
 Foreign Minister de la Puente said the
 Soviets offered the best deal available,
 and "we accept the proposal." This an-
 nouncement immediately received
 widespread international press coverage,
 but within a few hours a government
 spokesman denied that de la Puente's
 statement had confirmed the purchase.
 Apparently, the foreign minister learned
 that he had made the announcement
 prematurely.
 This will be Peru's first purchase of
 Soviet fighter aircraft. We believe the
 plane to be sold Peru will be the SU-22, a
 variant of the SU-17 Fitter. If the
 reported $250 million price tag for 36
 SU-22s covers only aircraft, spare parts,
 and technical assistance-and not radar,
 airfield construction, and support
 facilities-then the price is relatively high.
 The SU-22 is likely to be comparably
 priced to the SU-20-$3.5 million per air-
 craft, plus parts and technical assistance.

 weeks the Morales Bermudez administra-
 tion has endeavored to reassure its
 neighbors that they have nothing to fear
 from Peru's ac uisition of hi h  erfor-

 In addition, Peru has sought to mo i y
 the US by asserting that the purchase has
 no political implications and that the
 Soviet role would be limited to pilot train-
 ing and advisory teams. The purchase is
 nonetheless likely to open wider the door
 to Soviet influence in Peru.
 BRAZIL
 Brazil is planning to cut public invest-
 ment growth next year in a major effort
 to curb inflation. Price increases are
 likely to exceed 50 percent this year,
 compared with 30 percent in 1975. Prices
 have risen despite a tight money policy,
 soaring interest rates,  and a ceiling
 on wage increases.
 Although details still are being worked
 out, the investment cuts apparently will
 affect key areas in which the public sector
 is deeply involved-energy, iron and steel,
 chemicals, and mining industries, as well
 as transportation and other services.
 The private sector, which accounts for
 more than 80 percent of total fixed invest-
 ment, has been bearing the brunt of
 austerity measures. Tax and credit incen-
 tives to private investors have been selec-
 tively reduced since last year. The
 state-owned National Economic Develop-
 ment Bank has cut back loan dis-
 bursements to private development proj-
 ects, originally slated to reach nearly $4
 billion this year.
 These measures are beginning to slow
 excess demand, but stiff import controls
 that limit the supply of goods and sharply
 increase the cost of imports continue to
 fuel inflation. Raw material shortages are
 becoming severe and black markets are
 appearing  in  some industrial  raw
 materials.
 Brazil, nevertheless, intends to main-
 tain import controls for at least another
 year and may even tighten them further in
 an attempt to reduce the current-account
 deficit. The deficit is now expected to ex-
 ceed $6 billion this year, down a little
 from $6.8 billion in 1975.
 The proposed investment cuts, along
 with the previous controls, probably will
 hold real economic growth to less than 5
 percent in 1977. By delaying the comple-
 tion of plants that are to produce import
 25X1
 25X1
 substitutes, the cuts would also help
 prolong Brazil's dependence on imported
 goods.
 The government's critical review of
 public investment programs has already
 heightened tension within the cabinet and
 probably is largely responsible for a re-
 cent spate of rumors of an impending
 shake-up. Ministers responsible for run-
 ning state enterprises will continue quiet
 lobbying to forestall budget cuts until
 final  decisions  are  made.

 Soviet leaders clearly have their minds on the problem of
 preparing for the succession to top party and government jobs.
 Their actions at present, however, are taking them further away
 from a long-term solution to the question.
 USSR: Politics and the Succession Issue
 CA
 -,A&~~~ ~kR
 Soviet party secretary Kirilenko, by
 placing a protege on the secretariat at the
 Central Committee plenum last week, im-
 proved his status and advanced his claim
 to be next in line for the post of party
 leader. The absence of moves enhancing
 the positions of younger leaders amounts
 to a net loss in their standing in the
 succession lineup.
 Focus on Succession
 The Soviet leadership is now ap-
 proaching all key personnel changes with
 an eye to their effect on the succession.
 During the early 1970s when General
 Secretary Brezhnev's authority was being
 reinforced,  younger opponents were
 eliminated and efforts were made to
 maintain a balance among Brezhnev's
 colleagues    within  the collective
 leadership.
 Submerging the succession issue during
 these years has made it all the more
 troublesome now, when there is a clear
 need to fill vacant jobs and to decide
 questions of protocol precedence. The
 stalemate that persists at present seems to
 reflect the balance of power and rivalry
 among the senior leaders and also their
 fears for their own positions if successors
 are designated.
 Premier Kosygin's extended illness last
 summer, which raised the possibility that
 he would have to relinquish his post, must
 have forced the Politburo to concentrate
 more sharply on the succession. As the
 focus of politics has changed, the arena
 has shifted from the Politburo to the
 secretariat-the executive arm of the Cen-
 tral Committee.
 Between 1968 and this year, only one
 new party secretary was appointed and
 only one was dropped. At the party
 Congress earlier this year, however, two
 new secretaries were appointed-Pravda
 chief editor Zimyanin and the head of the
 Central Committee's general department,
 Chernenko. Also this year, the Politburo
 dropped Agriculture Minister Polyansky
 and added two new full members, Defense
 Minister Ustinov and Leningrad party
 chief Romanov.
 The plenum last week made no changes
 in the Politburo. It elected another
 secretary-Ryabov-and   retained
 Ustinov on the secretariat despite his new,
 full-time government job as defense
 minister.
 Contenders Blocked
 Any serious candidate for the principal
 succession prize, Brezhnev's job, would
 undoubtedly have to be a member of the
 secretariat.  The appointments to the
 secretariat of Brezhnev's protege
 Chernenko     and  Kirilenko's  protege
 Ryabov block the way for more qualified
 candidates.
 Seemingly obvious candidates, such as
 Leningrad party chief Romanov and
 Ukrainian first secretary Shcherbitsky,
 have still not been transferred to jobs in
 the capital. The unusual retention of
 Ustinov may result from the game of
 secretariat politics now being played.
 One Moscow job, chief of the trade un-
 ions, remains open after a year and a
 half-even though a trade union congress
 has been announced for next March. Part
 of the difficulty in filling the vacancies
 may be that ambitious younger persons
 are unwilling to take unpromising
 assignments when a generational change
 seems  likely soon to  offer better
 prospects.
 Kirilenko Gains Ground
 Last week's plenum demonstrates that
 not bringing leaders such as Romanov
 and Shcherbitsky to Moscow helps those
 who, however deficient in qualifications
 for a top post, are already on the scene.
 The 70-year-old Kirilenko was the notable
 beneficiary.
 Kirilenko's blatant self-promotion at a
 ceremony on October 14 naming him a
 Hero of Socialist Labor appears to have

 SECRET
 been a critical point in the pre-plenum
 maneuvering. He may have been making
 a plea finally to be recognized as the par-
 ty's second secretary and heir to
 Brezhnev.
 Brezhnev did not repeat at the plenum
 his success at the Congress, when he
 brought his crony Chernenko into the
 secretariat. For the first time since he has
 been  General  Secretary,  Brezhnev
 accepted an obvious client of another
 leader into the central councils. His own
 man, Tikhonov, did not make it.
 Brezhnev Acclaimed
 Brezhnev nevertheless has enjoyed a
 wealth of new honors and acclaim this
 year, and still more adulation is probably
 in store on the occasion of his 70th birth-
 day  in                     December.  Kirilenko,  while
 pushing himself forward, went to unusual
 lengths at the award ceremony to praise
 Brezhnev. He referred to Brezhnev as
 "vozhd," a term for leader rarely used
 since Stalin.
 Publication of Brezhnev's plenum
 speech, which does not conform to the
 usual practice since Brezhnev became
 General Secretary, is also a plus for him.
 Brezhnev normally delivers the main
 report at plenums,  but withholding
 publication of the proceedings has been a
 means of protecting the image of collec-
 tive leadership.
 In the foreign affairs section of his
 speech, Brezhnev dwelt on the stead-
 fastness of the policy of detente and on his
 personal role in conducting foreign policy,
 including plans to visit West Germany
 and France. This is the policy area and
 role that has done the most to enhance
 Brezhnev's  leadership  position.  The
 success  of his policies abroad will
 probably continue to affect Brezhnev's in-
 fluence within the leadership.
 State of Play on Succession
 Kirilenko's recent behavior breaks with
 the gray, subservient image that he has
 maintained for over a decade as
 Brezhnev's deputy. In arranging the ap-
 pointment of Ryabov to the secretariat he
 has elevated an unmistakable protege;
 Ryabov, first secretary of the Sverdlovsk
 region, began his party career there under
 Kirilenko.
 Kirilenko seems to have been active in
 pushing himself and Ryabov forward even
 before Kosygin fell ill. On June 23, Prav-
 da ran a lengthy interview with Ryabov
 and followed it three days later with com-
 ments on the interview from Sverdlovsk.
 On July 14, Kirilenko took the unusual
 step of participating in a session of the
 Council of Ministers that reviewed the
 five-year plan and the 1977 plan and
 budget. Recent Moscow gossip alleging
 that the other senior secretary, Suslov, is
 a has-been and spends little time at the of-
 fice may have been inspired by partisans
 of Kirilenko.
 Suslov has not been inactive. The
 promotions of Romanov and Zimyanin
 this year were probably congenial to
 him. Although Romanov seems to have
 good relations with many of the senior
 leaders, Suslov appeared to be cham-
 pioning Romanov's interests as his own
 during his trip to Leningrad in September.
 As long as Kosygin is able to carry on,
 the senior leaders will probably be inclin-
 ed not to make a change in the
 premiership. It is not clear whom Kosygin
 sees  as  his  successor,  although
 presumably he would favor his long-time
 first deputy, Mazurov. Brezhnev's protege
 Tikhonov was probably not Kosygin's
 choice for promotion to first deputy
 premier in early September.
 Both first deputies were slighted at the
 plenum. Tikhonov failed to get on the
 Politburo, although the position he holds
 has usually merited this status and a press
 picture last month showed him standing
 with the full members of the Politburo.
 The designation of Gosplan chairman
 Baybakov to substitute for Kosygin in
 delivering the report on the five-year plan
 to the Supreme Soviet last week denied
 Mazurov a public sign that he is in line for
 the premiership.
 The problem of succession will continue
 to  cause  maneuvering and tension.
 Kirilenko, for example, may now be in a
 somewhat exposed position that could
 prompt countermoves by others. Much
 depends on whether Brezhnev decides to
 try to line up his own successor. The
 history of Soviet leadership politics and
 the developments last week suggest that
 he and the other seniors will act cautiously
 and slowly on the issue.

 Prospects are good that the USSR will be able to reduce its
 hard-currency trade deficit this year, but Poland,
 Czechoslovakia, and East Germany will probably go further in
 debt.
 Soviet, East European Trade Deficits
 Efforts by the USSR and the East
 European countries to reduce their hard-
 currency trade deficits this year have
 produced mixed results.
 Because of improving trade, the
 USSR's hard-currency trade deficit for
 1976  will  probably  be about $5
 billion-down from $6.3 billion last year.
 Soviet hard-currency imports in the last
 half of 1976 should be well below the $7.9
 billion recorded from January through
 June. Grain imports are likely to fall from
 $2 billion to about $1 billion. Other im-
 ports  should continue to rise
 slowly-about 10 percent above the first
 half. Soviet exports should be .28 percent
 above the January to June level of $4.5
 billion. In addition to the traditional
 Soviet fourth quarter export spurt, ex-
 ports are likely to be bolstered by Western
 economic recovery.
 Up to 60 percent of the Soviet deficit
 this year probably will be covered by
 largely government-backed medium- and
 long-term credits. The balance will be
 covered by general purpose borrowing on
 the Euromarket, a drawdown on cash
 reserves, and gold sales.
 The USSR apparently has not obtained
 large amounts of untied credits on the
 Eurodollar market this year. Because the
 Soviets borrowed more than $4 billion in
 1975, many Western banks are near or at
 their lending limits to the USSR. The
 Western banking community in general
 has become far more selective about ad-
 ditional lending.
 To protect its credit rating and remain-
 ing borrowing capacity on the Eurodollar
 market, the USSR has taken several steps
 to reduce its dependence on this type of
 financing. It has:
 ? Tightened controls over foreign
 exchange expenditures, including
 deferment of cash down-payments on
 some orders until 1977.
 ? Made greater use of promissory
 note financing for equipment imports.
 As a result, Soviet gross liabilities in-
 creased over the first quarter at half the
 rate of the preceding quarter.
 Poland probably will not reduce its

 Czechoslovakia and East Germany also
 failed to reduce their trade deficits in the
 first half of 1976 compared with the first
 half of 1975 and are not likely to do better

 Czechoslovakia permitted little growth in
 imports, its deficit grew as exports con-
 tinued to stagnate. The East Germans
 managed to boost exports by about 5 per-
 cent, but imports from the West also rose
 slightly.
 Czechoslovakia is borrowing more in
 the Eurocurrency market than in the past.
 It recently received a $200-million loan
 from a consortium of four West German
 banks. It has previously relied mainly on
 government-guaranteed credits, but its
 hard-currency needs have apparently
 become too large to be covered by these
 sources.
 The East Germans borrowed about
 $600 million on the Euromarket in the

 Thailand's new military government has yet fully to sort
 out its domestic priorities, In foreign affairs, it is showing in-
 terest in better relations with the US, and the momentum
 toward closer ties with communist Indochina has slowed.
 In some respects, politics in Thailand
 has come full circle since 1973 when stu-
 dent demonstrations forced a military
 strongman into exile. The military have
 now resumed a direct political role. They
 have quickly produced a constitution to
 make their authority legitimate and are
 selecting a "legislature" to rubber stamp
 the decisions of the executive-common
 characteristics  of past  military
 governments in Thailand.
 In other respects, the new administra-
 tion is atypical. The selection of a civilian
 prime minister and cabinet and the
 promise of a phased return to represen-
 tative    government-however
 remote-reflect an appreciation of the
 public's continuing regard for democratic
 institutions despite disappointment with
 their frailties in Thailand.
 The  weaknesses  of parliamentary
 democracy in Thailand were made
 palpable by the growing polarization of
 Thai political forces and the frequent un-
 rest generated by protest politics since
 1973. The return from exile of former
 military strongman Thanom Kittikachorn
 generated the turmoil that led to military
 intervention, largely by bringing to a head
 a number of disruptive problems.
 Thanom's presence energized a divided
 and languishing student movement. It
 provided right-wing groups-eager for a
 showdown with leftist students-an op-
 portunity to marshal their forces. And it
 highlighted the government's inability to
 deal effectively with a crisis, putting
 further pressure on a coalition already
 weakened by the jockeying for advantage
 Thailand: Back to Square One
 among coalition leaders and by the
 deepening divisions in Prime Minister
 Seni's Democratic Party.
 Deputy  Prime  Minister  Praman
 Aderecksan had been pressing Seni hard
 for the Defense Ministry portfolio, a posi-
 tion that would have permitted him to
 strengthen his political base in the army
 and one that Prime Minister Seni was
 determined to deny him. Praman's party
 was rumored to be financing both right-
 and left-wing protest groups, hoping the
 ensuing unrest would force a cabinet
 reorganization that would strengthen his
 position.
 Threatened by Praman and repudiated
 by the liberals in his own party who were
 demanding  Thanom's expulsion,  Seni
 could see nothing ahead but a worsening
 political crisis, a prospect that left him no
 alternative but martial law to re-establish
 stability and direction to the Thai govern-
 ment.
 Even so, the government might have
 survived if reports that students had of-
 fended the royal family with a mock hang-
 ing of the crown prince had not inflamed
 public sentiment, removed any restraint
 on right-wing reaction, and led to violence
 and unprecedented brutality on the Tham-
 masat campus. The bloodshed at Tham-
 masat and  the continuing right-wing
 demonstrations against the government
 convinced the military that the time had
 come to step in.
 The military did not need much convin-
 cing. They were never comfortable with
 the free-wheeling political atmosphere of
 the "democratic experiment" or with
 their relegation to the sidelines. But the
 military's impatience to intervene was
 held in check by the threat of bloody stu-
 dent resistance and by the opposition of
 the King
 e New Regime
 Admiral Sa-ngat, Air Chief Marshal
 Kamon, and General Soem, commander
 of the Royal Thai Army-the leaders of
 the National Administrative Reform
 Council  established  on October
 6th-represent the more professional and
 apolitical elements of the Thai armed
 forces. Sa-ngat pressed vigorously for the
 rapid formation of a new civilian ad-
 ministration-largely a facade for the
 military's continuing domination  of
 government policy, but one he hopes will
 permit the military to lower its visibility
 and gradually reduce its involvement.
 Sa-ngat and his like-minded colleagues
 clearly do not believe that Thailand can or
 should turn the clock back to the days
 when the generals ran the country for per-

 sonal economic advantage and the
 professional caliber of the armed forces
 suffered from the political preoccupations
 of its leaders.
 Sa-ngat's leadership and policy of a
 restrained military role have not gone un-
 challenged, however. The ambitions of
 General Yot, army deputy commander
 and recent commanding officer of the
 First Army, are already threatening the
 stability of the military council. Yot is
 trying to exploit his residual influence in
 the First Army to build a dominant posi-
 tion from which he could challenge
 Sa-ngat and his more moderate
 colleagues. The First Division of the First
 Army is the Bangkok garrison that has
 often led coups.
 Yot's maneuvering has been balanced
 by the opposition of the majority of the
 council who have thrown their weight
 behind Sa-ngat. If the new First Army
 commander begins to assert himself,
 Yot's  influence  may  diminish.
 Nonetheless, the absence of strong army
 leadership-General Soem,  the  army
 commander, has little following in the ar-
 my-bodes ill for the future stability of
 the present government.
 Sa-ngat is defense minister in the new
 cabinet-a post he held for the last day of
 the Seni government and one that should
 strengthen his hand against Yot. Kamon
 is chairman of the new Prime Minister's
 Advisory Council, a truncated version of
 the National Reform Council intended to
 represent the military's interests in the
 government, although the full Council
 reportedly will continue to operate behind
 the scenes at least until a national
 assembly is selected. General Kriangsak,
 who built a reputation for skillful handl-
 ing of the US military presence in
 Thailand, is the Vice Chairman of the Ad-
 visory  Council  and  concurrently
 Secretary General of the full Council; he
 is emerging as one of the principal figures
 of the new regime.
 The civilians are expected to be
 thoroughly dominated by the military,
 although  Prime  Minister  Thanin
 Kraiwichian reportedly was the personal
 selection of the King. If true, that connec-
 tion would give Thanin added strength in
 dealing with the generals. Thanin's strong
 anti-communist sentiments and his
 reputation  as  a  counterinsurgency
 specialist (which made him an attractive
 choice for the King) reflect a basic com-
 patibility with the military.
 Thanin's views-reformist to the point
 of puritanical-are out of character for
 Thai political leaders and may strike the
 easy-going Thai as extremist. The Thai,
 thoroughly sick of protest politics, are
 looking for a firm hand on the tiller.
 Thanin's concern about the communists,
 which apparently borders on an obsession,
 runs the risk of going too far and
 generating an atmosphere of repression
 that could cause a backlash against the
 government.
 Although most of those arrested on Oc-
 tober 6 in connection with the Thammasat
 riots have now been released, another
 3,000 persons, including 1,000 Vietna-
 mese, have been picked up since then.
 Initial public reaction to the anti-com-
 munist campaign was one of smug ap-
 proval, but the scope of arrests and re-
 ports of abuses have already produced
 signs of some disquiet.
 Prospects for Stability
 The King is clearly a stabilizing factor.
 His support for the new administration
 should give ambitious army generals
 pause; his open opposition would halt any
 countercoup plans. Even so, fissures in the
 military will be a continuing source of ten-
 sion. There appears to be a basic division
 between the reformists led by Thanin and
 Sa-ngat  and  the  more  typical
 wheeler-dealers led by Yot who have
 come up the traditional military ladder to
 power and no doubt are eager for the
 lucrative rewards that usually have ac-
 companied senior military positions. The
 government's appeals against corruption
 and the stern admonitions for a more
 austere life style for the military will
 probably be ignored but if pushed serious-
 ly could be an irritant.
 Threats from the "outs" do not yet
 appear serious. The Praman clique is
 frustrated by its sudden exclusion from
 power but lacks the requisite military
 muscle for a serious challenge. The urban
 left has gone underground, its cadre either
 lying low or vanished into the jungle
 redoubts of the Communist Party of
 Thailand. Most of the students attracted
 by the excitement of protest politics are
 now trying to clear themselves and return
 to school, and it is unlikely that more than
 the hard core of the radical movement will

 opt for the rigors of the jungle.
 It is too early to assess the impact of the
 return to authoritarian government on the
 communist insurgency. The current flurry
 of military activity in the northeast is in
 an area of frequent unrest and may reflect
 more aggressive activities by the Thai
 army than a new stage of communist
 operations. The Communist Party has
 always subordinated its urban operations
 to its activities in the countryside, and
 with the departure of its urban assets is
 probably not likely to undertake a
 program of urban terrorism in the near
 future.
 Foreign Policy Implications
 The Thai military were never comfor-
 table with the constitutional government's
 post-Vietnam war approaches to its com-
 munist neighbors, and the new leaders are
 now drawing back from what they think
 was a policy of over-anxious accommoda-
 tion. Relations with Hanoi have shifted
 into acrimonious exchanges. The Thai in-
 itially insinuated that Vietnam was in-
 volved in the student demonstrations, and
 the Vietnamese became exercised over the
 large-scale arrests of Vietnamese
 residents in Thailand and concerned
 about the implications of closer Thai-US
 relations.
 Vietnam has kept up a drumbeat of
 hostile rhetoric against the new regime
 and canceled plans to open an embassy in
 Bangkok. Nevertheless, the Vietnamese
 on October 13 released 53 Thai fishermen
 who had been taken prisoner two months
 earlier, and the government of Laos, fre-
 quently a stalking horse for Vietnam's
 policies, seems to be softening its initial
 hostility.
 Neither side has completely repudiated
 previous policies of accommodation, and
 the Thai clearly want to avoid a confron-
 tation with the Indochinese communists.
 Even so, the momentum toward closer
 Thai relations with communist Indochina
 has been significantly slowed.
 At the same time, Bangkok is eager to
 restore a special relationship with the
 US-acknowledging that US forces are
 probably gone for good, but hopeful that
 a generous military and economic aid
 program can be re-established.
 A number of steps have been taken
 with an eye toward wooing the US-
 the appointment of recent ambassador
 to the US Upadit Pacnariyangkun as
 foreign  minister,  the  announcement
 of a narcotics suppression campaign,
 and the sacking of the Permanent Sec-
 retary for Foreign Affairs, Anan Pan-
 yarachun, who was active in negoti-
 ating the expulsion of US forces from
 Thailand in recent talks with Vietnam
 Overpopulation, unemployment, and racial antagonisms
 make for a bleak future as the English-speaking mini-states in
 the Caribbean rush toward independence.
 Prospects for Caribbean Mini-States
 A num er of t e island mini-states of
 the English-speaking eastern Caribbean
 appear to be moving swiftly toward in-
 dependence. Three have already cut their
 ties with the UK-Trinidad and Tobago
 in 1962, Barbados in 1966, and Grenada
 in 1974. The five West Indies Associated
 States-Antigua, St. Kitts-Nevis, St. Vin-
 cent, St. Lucia, and Dominica- are likely
 to follow suit within the next few years.
 With a total population of about
 450,000 and a land area of less than
 2,600 square kilometers (1,000 square
 miles), the five will have severe eco-
 nomic problems. Some also seem des-
 tined, like Grenada, to drift toward
 domination by autocratic leaders.
 Leaders in some of the smaller states
 seem increasingly attracted to Cuban or
 Guyanese models as possible solutions to
 their problems. The growing tendency
 toward leftist authoritarianism, however,
 appears largely a consequence of mount-
 ing economic and social ills rather than a
 direct effect of Cuba's efforts to extend its
 influence. The two larger and more stable
 countries in the area--Trinidad and
 Tobago and Barbados-have shown little
 susceptibility to radicalism.
 Overpopulation and Unemployment
 Population densities of the
 English-speaking states are among the
 highest in the Western Hemisphere,
 averaging almost 550 persons per square
 mile. The shortage of land is acute. The

 migration from rural areas to urban
 centers with the consequent increase in
 poverty and overcrowding has increased
 crime and spawned other social ills.
 The economies of most of the islands
 are heavily dependent on one- or two-crop
 agriculture and tourism. Development of
 industry is hampered by small internal
 markets, high wage demands, and
 political and economic uncertainties that
 discourage foreign investment. Mineral
 resources, with the exception of the oil
 fields of Trinidad, are generally lacking.
 In the past two years, rising fuel prices, a
 drop in banana and sugar production, and
 a decline in tourism have added to the
 already serious economic problems.
 Unemployment is now estimated at
 over 20 percent among adults in Barbados
 and Trinidad and considerably more in
 the smaller islands and among young peo-
 ple. Emigration is becoming less feasible
 as the UK and Canada have limited the
 influx of migrants, and only the US con-
 tinues to absorb them in significant
 "TSP
 BRNAMAS
 numbers.
 The inhabitants of the eastern Carib-
 bean islands are becoming increasingly
 militant as a result of rising expectations
 for employment, housing, and education.
 The better educated younger people are
 becoming aware of long-standing social
 and racial inequities. Many regard foreign
 investment and expatriate ownership of
 desirable land as an extension of
 colonialism and see their own poverty as a
 product of racism.
 The blacks' hostility toward whites and
 lighter skinned peoples is a major factor
 in political alignments. In Trinidad, for
 example, the dominant People's National
 Movement is largely the party of the
 blacks while the allegiance of the East In-
 dians, who are almost as numerous as the
 blacks, is divided among minority parties.
 Race is also a factor in the region's
 policy definition. Prime Minister Eric
 Williams of Trinidad recently said racial
 considerations were responsible for

 Toward Independence
 Increased political consciousness,
 strongly influenced by the rising wave of
 nationalism throughout the world, has
 stimulated the five remaining West Indies
 Associated States to seek full in-
 dependence from the UK. Two probably
 will be independent within the next year or
 so.
 Last April, Premier John Compton of
 St. Lucia declared that his island would
 become independent in December, but
 foot-dragging by the main opposition par-
 ty is likely to delay independence. In
 August, Premier Patrick John of
 Dominica stated that his island state
 would become independent in 1977, a
 move that could occur as early as
 February.
 Premier  Robert Bradshaw of St.
 Kitts-Nevis has pressed the UK to es-
 tablish a timetable for independence, but
 the prospect that Nevis might secede
 probably will deter Bradshaw from mov-
 ing quickly. If Bradshaw should declare
 independence unilaterally and try to con-
 trol Nevis by force, the Nevisians would
 probably resist.
 Until early this year, Antigua appeared
 likely to be the first to declare in-
 dependence. That prospect has been set
 back several years, however, by the upset
 election victory in February of Vere Bird,
 who has indicated that he does not favor
 immediate independence.
 Premier Vincent Cato of St. Vincent
 has also publicly endorsed the principle of
 independence, but he has privately in-
 dicated that he believes it would be unwise
 to seek independence alone.
 An Associated State can achieve in-
 dependence by a two-thirds vote in a
 referendum or by persuading the UK of
 overwhelming popular sentiment for in-
 dependence. According to John and
 Compton, however, independence would
 not require either a referendum or a
 general election.
 The British representative to the
 Associated States believes that if any

 Associated  State leader unilaterally
 declares independence, the UK will do
 nothing. The British would like to end the
 financial drain, some $10 million annual-
 ly, imposed by the Associated States.
 Other British colonies in the eastern
 Caribbean could follow the Associated
 States into independence. Chief Minister
 Willard Wheatly of the British Virgin
 Islands recently predicted autonomy by
 1980 and  full independence shortly
 thereafter.
 Officials in both colonies, however, had
 earlier told US embassy officers that they
 had no desire to change their status.
 Anguilla, another British colony in the
 eastern Caribbean, also has indicated its
 clear preference to retain its ties to the
 UK.
 Barbados and Trinidad
 Recent elections in Barbados and
 Trinidad-where the citizens are better
 educated and more sophisticated and
 prosperous-provide a contrast to the
 leftward movement in some of the smaller
 Caribbean countries. The victory of
 "Tom" Adams and the Barbados Labor
 Party in the general election on
 September 2 was a setback for Cuban am-
 bitions in the Caribbean.
 Adams has categorically stated that he
 did not believe the charges of
 "destabilization" made against the US by
 his predecessor, and it seems evident that
 he will not cooperate extensively with
 Cuba. Although the Adams government
 did not reverse a decision made in August
 to allow the Cubans to use Barbados as a
 stopover for regularly scheduled Cubana
 flights to Africa, it has made clear its op-
 position to the resumption of Cuban
 military flights to Africa that use Bar-
 bados as a stopover.
 In Trinidad, Prime Minister Williams'
 largely black-based People's National
 Movement was returned to office on
 September 13. As long as Williams is in
 control, Cuba's chances of developing
 closer ties with Trinidad will be limited.
 Williams apparently views Cuba's Castro
 as a young upstart and rival. In addition,
 the essentially democratic character of the
 Movement has tended to preclude the
 appeal of radical socialist ideology.
 Outlook
 Racial tensions and bleak economic
 prospects in most of the islands are likely
 to result in serious political turmoil and
 some violence. As they gain in-
 dependence, the islands are likely to move
 toward repression and dictatorial rule by
 one person or one party.
 Prospects for a federation of newly in-
 dependent eastern Caribbean states seem
 poor. All past efforts to federate have fail-
 ed, and local leaders view federation as a
 threat to their own positions. Regional
 economic cooperation, such as the Carib-
 bean Community, has fared somewhat
 better. Because the economies of the
 island states are largely competitive,
 however, actual economic benefits have
 been small and unequally distributed.
 Given the likelihood that some of the
 smaller states will indeed opt for radical
 solutions, Cuban assistance to and in-
 fluence in those states will develop more
 rapidly. Dominica and St. Lucia, in par-
 ticular, may establish close ties with
 Cuba.
 Cuba's influence over the short run in
 Barbados and Trinidad is unlikely to in-
 crease substantially. Should high un-
 employment continue for several years,
 however, the commanding positions of
 moderates in both countries could be
 weakened.
 In Trinidad, Williams has not tapped a
 successor, and his death would leave the
 People's National Movement seriously
 split. This could open the way for leftists
 to gain strength and possibly even even-
 tual control of the government.
 Cuba's approach to the eastern Carib-
 bean states probably will be similar to its
 approach in Jamaica and Guyana: in-
 creased personal contacts between Cuban
 leaders and local political leaders; offers
 of security assistance; increased contacts
 between youth and labor organizations;
 and offers of technical aid. F
