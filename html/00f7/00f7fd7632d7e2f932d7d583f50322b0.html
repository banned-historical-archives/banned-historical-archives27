 EUROPE
 HONECKER IGNORES GUILLAUME AFFAIR, STRESSES GDR-USSR TIES
 In his first public, speech since Willy Brandt's resignation,
 GDR leader Honecker refrained from commenting directly on the
 Guillaume spy affair and called for the continuation of GDR-FRG
 relations as if nothing had intervened to upset them.  Speaking
 on 1.2 April at a congress of the German-Soviet Friendship Society
 in Dresden, Hone.cker declared that the GDR was ready "to develop
 normal relations of peaceful coexistence with the FRG" and claimed
 credit for the initiatives which had made possible such agreements
 as that ou establishment of permanent missions in the two countries'
 respective capitals.  He appealed to "all. responsible politicians"
 who are guided by "realism" to work for the further normalization
 of relations between the GDP and FRG,
 Honecker's tone of reasonableness is the more notable in that his
 speech came. just one day after Brandt had publicly challenged him
 in a speech in West. Berlin.  Brandt was quoted by the Western press
 as saying:  "Honecker may be in a position to contribute to the
 Chancellor's resignation, but no one should allow him. to undermine
 the policy of detente in the center of Europe.."  Honocker's fore-
 bearance from responding to such a direct personal challenge
 underscores the apparent determination o: the East German leaders
 to avoid inflaming the situation at the p.i?esenttime.
 In his speech Honecker laid great stress on the intimacy of GDR-USSR
 relations.  While this emphasis seemed called for by the occasion,
 it may also have been intended to serve notice that the authority
 of the regime and its international standing would not be shaken
 by the spy scandal.  TASS, in its summary of the speech, included
 the passage in which Honecker claimed that the two countries
 coordinated and harmonized their positions on the "strategic and
 tactical questions of foreign and defense policy."
 MOSCOW     Moscow has suggested by selective reportage and limited
 comment that continuity will be the keyword in the new
 Bonn leadership's policy toward Eastern Europe and the USSR.  Thus,
 in two Bonn-datelined dispatches in PRAVDA on the 10th and 12th
 by correspondent Ye. Grigoryev and ?.n IZVESTIYA on the 12th by
 S. Tosunyan, as well as, in a few radio commentaries on the resignation,
 Moscow has noted the elements of the developing Bonn domestic
 situation which reinforce this theme of continuity.   It has cited,

 for example, the continuation of the SPD-FDP coalition with its
 "stable" majority, Brandt's strong personal endorsement of Schmidt
 as the next: chancellor, Brandt's continuation as SPD chairman, and
 "evidence" in Schmidt's background of his support for Frandt and
 Ostpolitik.  In addition, and perhaps more significantly, Grigoryev
 cited on the 12th a leading FDP spokesman as saying "there was no
 alternative" to the Brandt-,Scheel policy toward the East.
 Self-initiated comment by Moscow has been extremely limited, but
 PRAVDA commentator T. Kolesnichenko, in a radio broadcast on the
 13th, declared that it was "encouraging" that Bonn has given
 "reassurances that the country's present policy will continue."
 Moscow's purported "public" radio station, Radio Peace and Progress
 (RPP), in a commentary to Germany on the 13th ridiculed allegations
 in the West that there was "uneasiness in the capitals of the
 socialist states" over the events in West r:ermany.  After citing
 many of the above, points as indicators that 11onn would continue
 its policy toward the East, including exceptional praise for
 Schmidt as "an energetic SPD politician" who has "more than once"
 demonstrated his support for the FRG's "constructive foreign policy,"
 RPP concluded:  "It goes without saying that our side has supported
 and will continue to support all constructive steps by the
 Federal Republic's government which are aimed at developing
 mutually advantageous links and mutual understanding with the Soviet
 Union and the other socialist states."
 Moscow has refrained from mentioning the Guillaume case since Brandt's
 resignation, attributing his departure as due, among other things,
 to difficulties within the SPD, "harassment by the reactionary forces,"
 and the internal economic situation.
 EAST EUROPEAN        The first high-level East European public reaction
 CRITICISM OF GDR     to Brandt's resignation came in a speech by Polish
 leader Gierek on the 8th.  Gierek raised to an
 official level the glowing praise for Brandt that had appeared in Warsaw
 commentaries following the resignation.  Speaking at a congress of
 World War II veterans, Gierek, in a highly emotional speech on the
 sufferings of the Polish people under Hitler, included a passage
 applauding the leadership of Brandt and Scheel.  He said that
 Brandt's resignation "surprised" the world and those from whom "he
 had gained great respect," adding that Poland "thinks" the FRG
 will continue its "positive trend."  Gierek's praise for Brandt as
 one who personally fought against Hitler could be interpreted as
 an indirect slap at the East Germans for going too far in their
 intelligence activities.

 Along the same line, an article in the Bucharest SCINTEIA on the
 9th declared that "the Romanian people consider regrettable the
 circumstances that led to the resignation, .    ."  Budapest radio
 carriad an interview with a West German reporter on the 12th
 which included the reporter's comment that he could see no future
 difficulties in Bonn's relations with East Europe except "only as
 regards the GDR."  Much of the routine East European comment
 continues to play down the idea that the Guillaume case was the
 real reason for Brandt's resignation, stressing that  internal
 economic and political difficulties were the true causes.
 MOSCOW SEES ITALIAN IMPORT CURB AS MARKING NEW EC CRISIS
 In comment on EC affairs following Roaie'i  announcement two weeks
 ago that Italy would impose restrictions on industrial and agz.'.
 cultural imports, Moscow has professed to see evidence of a new
 crisis in EC affairs testifying once more to the inability of the
 European states to reconcile their national differences.   In a
 weekly review of world events over Moscow radio on 13 May, PRAVDA
 foreign news editor T. Kolesnichenko called the Italian move
 "unprecedented."  He noted that Denmark had announced it also
 intends to restrict certain imports, albeit through raising
 tariffs, and he emphasized that a further "chain reaction" by
 other EC members may occur as individual states attempt to solve
 their own economic problems.
 While noting the disintegrative implications of these developments,
 Soviet media have stopped short of the pessimistic predictions
 offered in some West European newspapers that the EC, in beginning
 to regress to short-sighted policies of national protectionism, is
 disintegrating and facing the danger of a complete break-up.  A
 Moscow radio commentary by A. Zholkver on 6 May, for instance, placed
 Italy's import measures in a long list of various EC crises.  Remark-
 ing that all the EC countries face serious economic difficulties,
 Zholkver concluded mildly that the present situation reflects well-
 known differences in the economiu interests of capitalist states and
 is a sign of the "general crisis of capitalism."  Another Moscow
 radio commentary, by N. Kononov on 8 May, followed a similar line and
 characterized Italy's actions as current evidence of the "permanent
 ?              '.:risis in the EC," which Kononov defined as the incompatibility
 between the EC members' national interests and the interests of the
 EC as an .,)rganization.  Professing to find the underlying cau   of
 this opposition in an EC desire to satisfy international and - .tional
 monopoly interests, rather than to serve the public welfare, Kononov
 predicted that the EC would continue to experience such crises.

 15 MAY 1974
 Moscow showed similar restraint in treating the EC ministers
 meeting in Brussels on 7-9 May which discussed the Italian
 import measures.  The day after the meeting Moscow radio rebroad-
 cast virtually verbatim the Zholkver commentary of 6 May, which
 had only noted without evaluation that the meeting was taking
 place. A report in PRAVDA on 10 May by Yu. Yasnev, briefly re-
 viewing the meeting, said simply that the EC ministers had
 criticized Italy's actions and that the meeting ended in an
 "atmosphere of disagreement and pessimism."
 While continuing to depict the EC as being in a state of disunity
 and "permanent crisis," Moscow has at the same time restated its
 long-standing position that "closed economic groupings" such as
 the EC should be replaced by expanded economic relations "on Aa
 all-European level, including the socialist countries."  To
 reinforce the point, some comnent has asserted that the 15-year
 e:;perience of the socialist economic community, CEMA, has shown
 that all Europe could have a viable economic community, provided
 it is based on "full equality and mutual advantage."

 .V -E  DAY ANN I VERSARY
 DEFENSE MINISTER GRECHKO FAILS TO AUTHOR TRADITIONAL ARTICLE
 The most noteworthy feature of Moscow's 9 ~Iay commemoration. of
 V-E Day this year was Defense Minister Grechko's failure to
 contribute his usual PRAVDA article.  This was the first time
 since 1967 that Grechko has failed to author a PRAVDA article
 on this occasion with the exception of 1970, when lie delivered
 a speech in Moscow on the 25th V-E Day anniversary.  other
 military leaders, in commemorative articles appearing in the
 central press, for the most part retreated from last year's
 more optimistic assessments of world affairs and instead offered
 more guarded assessments that echoed themes in Brezhnev's address
 to the World Peace Congress in Moscow last October and the
 communique of the Warsaw Pact Political Consultative Committee
 meeting in Warsaw last month.  Of the military spokesmen, Admiral
 Gorshkov projected the most truculent image of the "imperialist"
 military t:.reat.  The only figure to break ranks from the otherwise
 solid military lineup was a military historian  who in a PRAVDA
 article singled out the improvement in U.S.-Suviet relations in
 recent years and called detente the "dominant" world trend--the
 latter theme having been drawn from the Warsaw Pact communique.
 Navy chief Sergey Gcr;hkov, writing in the 9 May TIRUD, was the
 most outspoken of all the military spokesmen in his marshalling of
 evidence for a continuing external threat.  He placed Brezhnev's
 World Peace Congress phraseology about "continuing and even
 intensifying" preparations for world war  into an even more ominous
 context, warning that "imperialism," having "regrouped its forces"
 since the last war, "has now launched preparations for a new world
 war under the guidance of the monopolies across the ocean and of
 the excessively militant circles who express their interests."
 That Gorshkov was warning specifically of the U.S. danger was
 apparent elsewhere as well--in his complaint about the "continuing
 arms race in the United States" and his reference to "nuclear
 blackmail" as an indication that Moscow must continue to look to
 its own defenses.  Gorshkov was also the only military spokesman
 to evoke. the spectre of Peking as a further cause for maintaining
 vigilance.
 Chief of the General Staff Viktor Kulikov,in RED STAR's contribution
 to the occasion, was the only military figure to list the recent
 debate in the United States over missile targeting strategy among
 the adverse developments in world affairs.  Following a line of

 Approved For Release 1996?66)iri1E)~-RDP85T4oi$o300070020-6
 argument established in earlier Moscow commentary on Defense
 Secretary Schlesinger's statements about targeting, Kulikov
 complained that the Pentagon was searching for "acceptable" means
 of waging a nuclear missile war.
 Strategic Missile Forces chief Vladimir Tolubko, speaking on
 Moscow radio on the 8th, Main Political Directorate head Yepishev,
 writing in IZVESTIYA on the 9th, and, other military figures
 generally made the same points, though in a less striking manner
 than Gorshkov.  All paid at lease minimal homage to the fruits
 of Soviet detente policy, but only First Deputy Defense Minister
 Sergey Sokolov, writing in SOVIET RUSSIA on t1.  9th, failed to
 accompany that observation with a reminder that developments in
 the West nevertheless require continued attention to Soviet
 defenses.
 A PRAVDA article by S. Tyushkevich, a member of the Institute
 of Military History of the Ministry of Defense, while conveying
 some of the same concerns about international affairs as the others,
 was the only one to single out, the "favorable turn" in U.S.-Soviet
 relations resulting from the 1972 and 19-3 summits and to cite
 that portion of the Warsaw Pact meeting's communique which noted
 that the trend toward detente is now the "dominant" feature of
 international relations.  Most military spokesmen, in pointing
 to the continuing threat, also singled out that portion of the
 Warsaw Pact communique, carried by TASS on 19 April, which had
 seemed to play down the significance of recent East-West arms
 limitation initiatives.  This passage had concluded that "as long
 as effective disarmament measures have not been implemented, the
 Warsaw Treaty count-Lies deem it necessary to strengthen their
 defenses and develop close coopor.:tion among themselves In this
 matter."
 Grechko's traditional Order of the Day for the occasion sustained.
 last year's more optimistic assessment of the international situation
 and was noteworthy primarily in adding praise for Brezhnev's personal
 role in foreign policy.  Gorshkov also emphasized Brezhnev's
 "tireless activity" in this regard.
 BACkOROUND     V-E Day commentators drawing upon the formula in
 Brezhnev's 26 October World Peace Congress speech--
 that "the process representing the most material preparation for
 world war is continuing and even intensifying" despite tho "win"
 trend toward detente--were following the lead of other military
 figures who have made effective use of his remark since then.  In
 the Soviet political leadership, only Grechko, Suslov and Ponomarev
 have reiterated this theme.

 ARAB-ISRAELI                  ISSUE
 USSR WARNS OF "HALF MEASURES,' SUPPORTS SYRIAN SUfrTlIT CALL
 Remarks by Kosygin, as well as a low volume of routine comment,
 continue to press the Soviet view that troop disengagement is
 only a first step toward an overall Mideast settlement and that
 partial measures by themselves would be unacceptable.  Reiterating
 this position in a 14 May speech at a dinner honoring Libyan Prima
 Minister Jallud, Kosygin declared that "we put emphasis on this
 matter because it became apparent lately that the aggressor and
 its patrons want to substitute some half measures, which only
 create a semblance of detente" in the Middle East, for an over-
 all settlement.
 Secretary Kissinger's talks in Israel and Syria on disengagement
 have been noted only briefly, primarily  .i Arabic-language broad-
 casts.  While one such item on the 11th reported that statements
 by Israelis and members of Kissinger's party were cautiously
 optimistic about an agz eement, other reports have taken pains to
 point out that Israel's "expansionist policy" constitutes an
 obstacle to an accord.   Soviet commentators charge Israel with
 insisting on the "unacceptable condition" that Israeli. occupation
 of Syrian territory should continue.  RED STAR said on the 12th
 that Israel's military operations on the Golan Heights, over and
 above their tactical significance, were aimed at frustrating a
 political settlement or at least forcing Syria to renounce its
 most important demands and make concessions.  Moscow commentators
 maintain that Syria has every right to take "effective steps" to
 liberate its territory,  insure its own security and insist on an
 honorable disengagement agreement.
 Hinting that a greater show of Arab support for Syria might be
 useful at the present juncture, Moscow has encouraged a Syrian
 request for an Arab summit conference.*  IZVESTIYA on the 12th
 and 14th carried dispatches from its Beirut correspondent on the
 need for such a meeting, stressing the "great importance" of
 Damascus radio reported on 8 May that Syria was holding dis?
 cussions with the Arab League on its request for an Arab summit
 conference to he held "soon.".  The Arab League Council, meeting
 in Tunis 25-2f? March, had decided to hold the seventh Arab summit
 in Morocco in September, but it indicated that the date could be
 advanced if Damascus considered that the situation or the Syrian
 front required it.

 Damascus' initiative.  Without mentioning a 1-''sible summit,
 TASS commentator Kulik noted on the 14th that ;yria had repeatedly
 urged the Arab countries to mobilize their resources and strengthen
 their solidarity so that Israel could not take advantage of Arab
 disunity.  And a Kole;;ichenko weekly review broadcast to North
 America on the 13th remarked that Israel might believe Syria was
 weak and "iaolated from other Arab countries" and its friends
 elsewhere.

 VIETNAM
 PRG SUSPENDS BILATERAL MEETINGS WITH GVN, JMC SESSIONS
 The PRG has announced that becauc,L of Saigon's "negative attitude"
 it has suspended participation in the two-party Joint Military
 Commission (JMC) talks in Saigon and in the consultative conference
 between the two South Vietnamese parties in France.  While the
 PRG has previously boycotted individual JMC sessions to protest
 Saigon's alleged lack of cooperation, this constitutes the first
 indefinite postponement of the meetings.  The talks at La Celle-
 Saint-Cloud had already been unilaterally adjourned by Saigon
 after the 47th session on 12 April, as a result of a GVN announce-
 ment on the 16th that it was suspending the talks sine die in
 retaliation for the loss of its base at Tonle Cham.*
 A 10 May statement by the PRG military delegation to the JMC
 declared that it was "forced" to suspend participation at the
 delegation-head level and in the subcommission sessions and
 detailed a long list of alleged grievances--most of which the PRG
 has frequently aired in the past--with regard to Saigon's ".scheme
 of intensifying the war and sabotaging" the Paris agreement.
 Concentrating on the charges directly pertaining to JMC operations,
 the statement declared that the PRG would resume  its attendance
 when Saigon agreed to "resume and insure the exercise of all
 privileges and immunities" of the PRG's JMC delegation and "adopt
 a serious attitude in negotiations."  According to the statement,
 Saigon has "paralyzed" the JMC through cancellation of the Saigon-
 Loc Ninh liaison flights, prevention of news conferences by the
 PRG military delegation, disruption of its telephone service, and
 obstruction of all contact with outsiders, including the Inter-
 national Commission of Control and Supervision.
 The justification provided by the PRG Paris delegation in its
 13 May statement for its formal suspension of the talks at
 La Celle-Saint-Cloud repeated the same charges made in the PRG
 military delegation's statement but gave no detailed explanation
 for taking the identical action for which the PRG has been
 criticizing the GVN.  In setting forth the terms under which it
 would resume the talks, the statement only dealt in broad

 generalizations--requiring that Saigon stop "undermining the
 negotiations" and adopt a "serious attitude."       The Paris delega-
 tion statement also lashed out at U.S. "high officials" who have
 reaffirmed their "intention to carry on . . . a neocolonialist
 policy in South Vietna1n" and berated the Nixon Administration
 for providing "increasing aid . . . , weapons, and other war
 materials and military advisers" to the Saigon administration.
 As a followup to the suspension of the two-party negotiations,
 the PRG on the 15th issued a foreign ministry statement--broadcast
 by Liberation Radio the same day--reiterating its previous
 complaints against Saigon but injecting new charges of U.S.
 complicity.  The statement accused the United States of being the
 "mastermind that has directed the Nguyen Van Thieu administration
 in sabotaging the Paris agreement" and characterized these actions
 as the "direct and basic cause underlying the present extremely
 hazardous situation in South Vietnam."  It warned the United States
 and Saigon not to continue their "adventurous military acts" or
 sabotage negotiations and "create the danger of total collapse"
 of the consultative conference and the JMC.
 DRV NOTES MILITARY PROMOTIONS, TRUONG CHINH DELEGA",ION TOUR
 Recently Hanoi media have begun to reveal military promotions alluded
 to by DRV President Ton Duc Thang who anncunced at a "recent"
 military cadres conference--reported by Hanoi radio on 27 April--
 that the state was "promoting and bestowing the general-level
 military rank on a number of comrane","*  Most notably, Hanoi's
 12 May report on the funeral of Bui Lam, former deputy chief of
 the People's Supreme Procuratorate, identified Vice Minister of
 Defense Nguyen Don as a lieutenant general, rather than in his
 pr'ious rank as major general.  His promotion is not surprising,
 since he also holds important posts as army deputy chief of staff
 and member of the Standing Committee of the Central Military Party
 Committee; he also delivered a report to the fourth session of the
 National Assembly in February as a representative of the Ministry
 of National Defense--a role traditionally filled by Defense
 Minister Vo Nguyen Giap.
 Two promotions to major general have also been revealed by Hanoi
 in recent days.  A 9 May VNA report on the attendance of DRV
 officials at a navional day reception' at the Czechoslovak embassy

 discussed in the TRENDS of 1 May 1974, pages 2-3.

 for the first time identified Deputy Chief of Staff Phung The Tai
 as a major general.  Tai had been the only deputy chief o'i staff
 who was only a senior colonel.  A 14 May radio report on the
 composition of a National Assembly delegation going to Czechoslovakia
 and Hungary, led by Truong Chinh, revealed that it included a
 previously unidentified major general.  Judging by the radio
 account--the only available report on the delegation--the new major
 general would apper" `i be former Senior Colonel Nguyen Quyet, an
 officer with respo_tsibilities in the Third Military Region.  The
 radio report noted that he was a military region political commissar.
 TRUONG CHINFI      The  National Assembly delegation led by Truong
 DELEGATION         Chinh was seen off from Hanoi on 14 May by
 P-'litburo members Pham Van Dong, Le Duc Tho,
 Nguyen Duy Trinh, Huang Van Hoan, Tran Quoc Hoan, and Van Tien
 Dung.  The substantial leadership turnout for the departure
 underlined the absence from the group of both First Secretary
 Le Duan and Defense Minister Giap, but their presence would not
 be mandatory for the departure of this type of delegation.
 Neither Le Duan nor Giap was among leaders present at the departure
 of the last known previous such delegation abroad--one led by
 Hoang Van Hoan in August 1971.  (No public activities by Giap have
 been reported since Hanoi radio on 7 May broadcast an undated
 television talk he had given to mark the 20th anniversary of Dien
 Bien Phu.)  Truong Chinh's last trip abroad was in December 1972,
 when he headed a party-government delegation to celebrations of the
 50th anniversary of the founding of the USSR.
 Truong Chinh's forthcoming visit to Czechoslovakia will fulfill a
 DRV promise, at the time of a Czechoslovak National Assembly
 delegation's visit in April 1973, to pay a return visit to Prague.
 A Supreme Soviet delegation visited Hanoi last December and,
 although no public invitation was extended at that time, it is
 possible Hanoi may yet announce an extension of the Truong Chinh
 tour to include Moscow.  The Hoang Van Hoan delegation in
 August-September 1971 visited the USSR, Poland, Czechoslovakia,
 and Romania.

 PEKING FETES BHUTTO, ENDORSES RECONCILIATION ON SUBCONTINENT
 Peking leadership remarks during the 11-14 May visit by Pakistani
 Prime Minister Bhutto reflected Chinese approval of the April
 Indo-Pakistan agreement to implemr-nt the remaining 1971 UN
 resolutions on the Ind(,-Pakistani. war as well. as China's readiness
 to improve its own relations with India and Bangladesh '.'bile
 still supporting Pakistan.  Peking accorded Bhutto the same
 full honors shown during his last visit in early 1972, including
 a meeting with Mao on 11 May and talks with Chou En-lai.  A
 joint communique issued on 14 May testified to both sides' "full
 satisfaction" with Bhutto's visit, just as in 1972.
 Chou En-lai's recently reduced public appearance posture was
 demonstrated by his absence from airport ceremonies, banquets,
 and some conversations with Bhutto, although Chou did attend
 meetings with him on 11 and 12 May as well as Bhutto's audience
 with Mao.  Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping, playing host in Chou's
 stead, called attention to that fact in his 12 May banquet speech
 by noting that he had been "ei.itrusted" by Chou to host the
 gathering.  Teng also attendee.' Bhutto's 11 May audience with
 Mao--the first time Teng has .ublicly joined the chairman in meeting
 foreign guests since he returned to public prominence two years ago.
 SOUTH ASIA     Chinese public statements --lfiring Bhutto's visit
 pointed up the present need for reconciliation in
 South Asia, ohile predictably praising Pakistan's s tiuggle to
 sustain its sovereignty and independence.  Teng Hsiao-ping's
 banquet speech on the 12th offered formal Chinese approval for the
 final implementation of the 1971 UN resolutions, stressing that
 these "new developments" have created "favorable conditions" for
 normalizing relations among the countries on, the subcontinent.
 Focusing on Peking's own intentions, Teng went beyond the usual
 Chinese affirmation of friendship with the "peoples" of the
 region, asserting that Peking is now ready to develop relations
 with the "countries" of the subcc:ntiunt on the basis of the five
 principles of peaceful coexistence.
 In marked contrast to Chinese comment during Bhutto's 1972 visit,
 this time Chinese spokesmen studiously avoided direct criticism
 of India's policies in South Asia.  They instead endeavored to
 portray China as having a common, anti-superpower intercat with
 South Asian states, stressing that these states should be

 particularly vigilant against. Soviet intentions.  An 11 May
 PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial warned that the Soviets were "threat-
 ening the security" of the area.  Teng's 12 May address, in
 referring to the 1971 war, placed full blame on the USSR for
 initiating the conflict that dismembered Pakistan while
 avoiding any mention of India's role.  The joint communique
 issued by the two sides dLd contain indirect criticism of India
 as well as the Soviet Union, noting the need to maintain
 vigilance against "tendencies toward hegemonism and expansionism"
 in South Asia and also stating their opposition to "foreign"
 interference  there.
 As Chou En-lai had done during Bhutto's last visit, Teng on 12 May
 affirmed Chinese support for Kashmiri  "self-determination"--a
 remark which triggered a walkout by the Indian representative
 at the banquet.  Peking reiterated this stand in the joint
 communique. The Chinese had last affirmed such support in a
 16 January 1974 banquet address by a PLA deputy chief of staff
 then visiting Pakistan.
 PEKING CALLS FOR PARTY UNITY IN KIANGSI, INJEICHOW
 Peking's concern to avoid entangling the struggle against Lin Piao
 and Confucius in a web of debilitating factional disputes has been
 demonstrated by instructions, to two, provinces--Kiangsi and
 Kweichow--that seem to call for halting all actions that would
 weaken unified party leadership or threaten productio,,i.  Throughout
 the current ideological campaign Peking has repeatedly indicated
 that workers and peasants should participate in the struggle only
 during their sparetime hours, and that the campaign should serve
 to stimulate--not interrupt--production.  The new -oarnings from
 the Central Committee, publicized by Nanchang radio on the 9th
 and Kweiyang radio on the 10th, signal a general tightening of
 Peking's crackdown against unauthorized factional excesses in
 some provinces.  Neither Kiangsi nor Kweichow has a currently active
 party first secretary; both former leaders fell in the aftermath of
 the Lin affair and have never been replaced.
 The Kweiyang broadcast reported that an "important note" from the
 central committee on criticism of Lin and Confucius in Kweichow
 was read at a 3 May rally held by the provincial party committee.
 The radio report did not give specific details of the note's content,
 but the, rally participants seemed to be pointing a critical finger
 at certain provincial party officials when they denounced local

 attempts to "sow discord among the masses" and pledged to regard
 criticism of Lin and Confucius "in the leadership offices of the
 provincial CCP committee" as a "key point" of the campaign.
 Stressing the need for following the unified leadership of party
 committees in order to properly carry out the anti-Confucius
 campaign, the report declared that no individual can be allowed
 to go his "own way" and use central committee instructions "for
 his own purposes."  Cadres were urged to see that the masses
 stay at their posts and grasp revolution and production so that
 criticism of Lin and Confucius can becomcc_, a "powerful motive force
 impelling industrial and agricultural production."
 The center's concern that the current ideological struggle be
 waged in a unified and controlled manner was also underscored in
 the Nanchang broadcast of a KIANGSI DAILY commentator's article.
 It revealed that Mao and the central committee have "issued
 important instructions" on many occasions in connection with the
 movement to criticize Lin and Confucius in "our province."  The
 articlc focused on the need to eliminate all "words and deeds"
 at variance with central committee instructions, which must be
 obeyed "to the litter."  It also called for strengthening unified
 party leadership to overcome the influence of Lin's followers,
 who have "stirred up trouble" by playing "one group against the
 other" in an attempt to split the party, and stated that no
 "breach of discipline" or "repetition" of these offenses would be
 allowed.

 COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP RESURFACLD; NEW PROMINENCE FOR MILITARY
 Recent developments in the Soviet Union connected with the
 traditional May Day celebration in Red Square and the quadrennial
 USSR Supreme Soviet election campaign have provided striking
 evidence of new influences at work in Soviet politics.  On the
 one hand the principle of oligarchical supremacy, which in recent
 years has been overshadowed by Brezhnev's burgeoning personality
 cult, was vigorously reaffirmed during the May Day ceremonies.
 In a separate but undoubtedly related development, the Soviet
 armed forces have for the first time in recent memory been officially
 acknowledged as a Soviet political constituency.
 With little if any fanfare, the May Day ceremony this year was
 transformed from an event monopolized by Brezhnev into a practical
 reaffirmation of coll.ecti.~ie leadership.  For the first time since
 1965 no speech by a member of the leadership was delivered on
 Red Square--Brezhnev had performed the honors four times in the
 previous five years,  This year's vacuum was filled by the publication
 in all central papers on .l. May of an unsigned message of greetings
 from the collective institutions of power--the CPSU Central Committee,
 the USSR Supreme Soviet. Presidium and the USSR Council of Ministers.
 In another significant  d.epar.ture with perhaps more far-reaching
 implicactons, the regime newly acknowledged the armed forces as
 a powerful constituency in the Soviet body politic.  This acknow-
 ledgment came in the form of a significant change in the usually
 stereotyped "open letter" in which the Soviet leaders traditionally
 address the public dus:.ug the quadrennial national election campaigns.
 This year's letter, published in PRAVDA on 5 May, for the first
 time in the.post-Stalin, period listed "military units" and "service-
 men of the army and navy" as constituents of the 28 members of the
 Soviet leadership, along with the customary "collectives of enter-
 prises, collective farms, state farms, institutions and educational
 establishments,"
 This innovation in Soviet political symbolism appears to formalize
 another step in the gradual process of bureaucratic accommodation
 that has been a principal hallmark of the post-Khrushchev regime.
 The entry of Soviet Defense Minister Grechko into the CPSU Politburo
 in April 1973, together with Foreign Minister Gromyko and KGB
 Chairman Andropov, marked the culmination of this process, reviving
 for the first time in two decades direct representation in the
 Politburo of all the major bureaucracies in the Soviet state.

 PRC-PHILIPPINES RELATIONS:  Unusual Peking publicity surrounding the
 Manila visit by a Chinese basketball team has demonstrated China's
 interest in expediting the establishment of formal Sino-Philippine
 relations.  NCNA reports on the PRC team's meetings with President
 Marcos and Foreign Minister Romulo went beyond the usual reportage
 and featured separate reports highlighting the Philippine leaders,'
 stated desire to formalize diplomatic relations "soon."  NCNA's
 brief report on Marcos' meeting with the Chinese team on 7 May was
 followed on the 8th by a dispatch quoting Marcos as saying the
 present situation was leading "inexorably" to:aard normalization of
 relations, which he hoped would occur soon.  Similarly, NCNA's
 routine report on Romulo's meeting with the PRC team during i..:s
 11 May Hong Kong stopover also was followed up with a report on
 his press conference remarks advocating formal relations with the
 PRC.  The only other recent instance of Peking quoting a Southeast
 Asian leader's desire for closer ties with China occurred on
 26 April, when NCNA reported Malaysia Prime Minister Razak's
 remarks to the press four days earlier that Malaysia and the PRC
 would establish relations in the near future.
