AMERICA'S SECRET AGENTS: 
The Mysterious 1 'oings o 
By RICHARD and GLADYS HARKNESS 
The Post presents its own exclusive report on America's 
"silent service"? the supersecret Central Intelligence 
Agency. Here, revealed for the first time, are its methods, 
how it gets its operatives and its money, and its accom-
plishments?in Guatemala, Iran and behind the Iron Curtain. 
PART 
MAN with the plump pink cheeks and blue 
eyes of a typical middle-class German sat 
on the grassy hilltop overlooking the Red 
port city of Stettin on the left bank of the 
Oder River in communist-held Poland. As he had 
done every seasonable day of last spring, he basked 
in the warm April sun while washing down his lunch 
of dry bread and sausage with a liter of white wine, 
and watched the birds in the nearby trees through 
his field glasses. Then, rising to leave, he swept his 
glasses along the piers on the river front below, where 
freighters were being loaded for the thirty-mile trip 
northward along the Oder and into the open Baltic 
Sea. 
ONE 
Returning to his small machine-tool works after 
the noon hour, the businessman called in his secre-
tary to take dictation. The letter, addressed to a 
French automobile-parts concern, was formal and 
concise in the stiff manner of German commercial 
houses. It cited precise specifications for presses his 
firm was offering for sale to stamp out motorcar 
fenders. The price was less than the British could 
quote. The machines carried the official guarantee of 
the Ministry of Machine Industry of the Polish 
People's Republic. It was a letter that the local Red 
commissar could approve ?and did. 
But do the communists know even now, what the 
letter really was? The "East German businessman"

Col ? Castillo Armas (left), whose American-armed 
"freedom forces" drove out Guatemala's Reds. 
and his pretty Nordic-type blond "secretary" were 
plants of the United States' supersecret Central In-
telligence Agency. The innocent-appearing address 
on the letter was, in reality, a CIA drop in Paris. 
Once the letter from Stettin was in the hands of 
America's espionage and counterespionage service, it 
was rushed to a commonplace-looking shop in the 
arty Montmartre section, where a sign on the win-
dow read SALON DE PHOTOGRAPHIE. Behind this 
front of a simple photographic studio, a CIA micro-
film technician went to work. The agent, squinting 
through a magnifying glass under. bright lights, 
scraped at each " period " on the typewritten page 
with a delicate, razor-sharp instrument. Finally, one 
black dot came off. There, scarcely larger than the 
point of a pin, was a tiny circle of microfilm which 
had been pasted on the sheet of paper at the end of a 
sentence. It had been disguised by the ink of the 
secretary's typewriter ribbon back in Stettin as a 
period. The agent, holding his breath lest he blow 
away the minute speck, used tweezers to carry the 
film to a photographic enlarger. When he emerged 
from the darkroom, the blown-up message was the 
size of a tea saucer. The words could be read as easily 
as the words on this printed page. 
In accordance with basic intelligence security, the 
message was only gibberish to the CIA microfilm 
expert. (Also in accordance with security, what ac-
tually happened in Stettin and Paris has been dis-
guised in this account.) The spy team in Stettin had 
employed a code prearranged with CIA headquarters 
in Washington. The microfilm was a cryptogram 
based on a key in the twenty-second prayer of David 
in the Book of Psalms; that mournful lamentation of 
David which begins?appropriately, in view of the 
fate of the Poles under the Russians? "My God, my 
God, why hast Thou forsaken me?" 
The next step in CIA procedure was to transmit 
the unintelligible scramble to Washington by short-
wave radio under the cipher address: "For AWD's 
eyes only." That meant: for the sole attention of 
Allen Welsh Dulles, the Government's first civilian 
director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and 
younger brother of Secretary of State John Foster 
Dulles. 
The message, decoded by a cryptographic machine 
and transcribed in CIA's purplish-blue ink, was 
taken to Dulles in his office, where American and 
CIA flags and a huge world stereoscopic projection 
map dominate the room. Dulles worked with the 
supervising case man on this Polish project, and the 
full details of the report from Stettin are still classi-
fied top secret. But this much may be related: The 
two agents confirmed the underground route they 
planned to follow?successfully, it turned out ?in 
leaving the Red port, threading their way across 
eighty-four miles of communist-patrolled country-
side, and finding haven in a CIA "safe house" in 
West Berlin. To this may be added: When Dulles 
received the decoded message, he had information

mala five months ago. When. CIA agents reported the shipment, U.S. guns were flown to Colonel Armas. 
which enabled CIA to pull off one of the most suc-
cessful intelligence coups of the entire cold war. He 
was hot on the trail of proof that the communist-
dominated government of Guatemala was part and 
parcel of a Red conspiracy, hatched in Moscow, to 
give Russia a military toehold in Latin America hard 
by the Panama Canal. 
The message? broadly paraphrased to protect 
code security ?said this: A freighter named the Alf-
hem and flying the flag of Sweden had tied up at the 
dock at Stettin. More than 15,000 crates and boxes 
had been lowered into her hold. The rumor along the 
water front was that the cargo, which arrived by rail 
from Czechoslovakia, consisted of munitions from 
the communists' Skoda arms works. 
Dulles alerted agents in Europe and in Africa. 
From them, replies tracing the transaction were 
rushed to Washington. Stockholm: The Alfhem was 
owned by the Swedish shipping line, Angbats A. B. 
The line had chartered the vessel to a shipping agent 
in London, E. E. Dean. London: Terms of the 
charter stipulated that Dean, a financial middleman, 
should recharter the freighter to Alfred Christianson 
in Stockholm. Stockholm: Christianson represented 
the Alfhem as carrying optical-laboratory equip-
ment and optical glass for the French West African 
port of Dakar. 
The Secret of the Devious Freighter 
OTHER reports came into Dulles' office. Two 
? days  out of Dakar, the captain received radio 
orders to change his course for Trujillo, Honduras. 
Two days out of Trujillo, the captain's orders were 
countermanded again. The Alfhem was to proceed 
and unload at Puerto Barrios, the Caribbean port 
city of Red Guatemala. 
For optical-laboratory equipment and optical 
glass, the shipment received extraordinary atten-
tion. The Guatemalan Minister of Defense was on 
hand to direct unloading of the cargo at Puerto 
Barrios. Cordons of army troops sealed off the entire 
dock area. Details of soldiers guarded the special 
military trains which sped the freight to arsenals in 
Guatemala City. Despite a junior-sized Iron Cur-
tain, Dulles again received a message: The 15,000 
unmarked wooden boxes and crates were of a size 
and weight to contain 1900 tons of small arms and 
small-arms ammunition, plus light-artillery pieces. 
Dulles called an emergency session of the Intelli-
gence Advisory Committee behind sealed doors in 
CIA headquarters. Seated around the table were the 
intelligence brains of the Federal Government ? the 
heads of the Army, Navy and Air Force intelligence, 
the intelligence officers of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
the State Department and Atomic Energy Commis-
sion, and a representative of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation. 
The committee, making the hours count, produced 
a quick crash estimate of the Guatemalan situation. 
Those 1900 tons of arms represented enough military 
might in Latin America to enable the Guatemalan 
Army to crush her neighbors, Honduras and El Sal-
vador, and to march across Nicaragua and Costa 
Rica, to the Panama Canal. 
Immediately, with no recommendation as to a 
specific line of action, but with an emphatic warning 
that action was urgent, Dulles laid the crash esti-
mate before the National Security Council. The first 
evident result came two days later, on May seven-
teenth, when Secretary of State Dillies stripped the 
communist arms plot bare for all the world to see. 
The United States Government viewed the muni-
tions shipment with gravity, he said, because of its? 
origin and quantity. 
Then Washington lapsed into official silence for 
a week. But, during the period ending May twenty-
fourth, the Department of Defense dispatched two 
Air Force Globemasters over the Gulf of Mexico. 
Each plane ferried twenty-five tons of rifles, pistols, 
machine guns and ammunition to Honduras and 
Nicaragua. Now events ? some public, some veiled ? 
were moving rapidly. 
Col. Carlos Castillo Armas, former officer of the 
Guatemalan Army who was in exile in Honduras, 
obtained sufficient guns and munitions to equip 
each man in a force of fellow anticommunist refugees 
with a burp gun, a pistol and a machete. As he sent 
his troops across the Honduran-Guatemalan border 
with an ultimatum to communist puppet Jacobo 
Arbenz Guzman to capitulate, Castillo dispatched 
his "air force" of two old World War II P-38 fighter 
planes to buzz Guatemala City. The Arbenz air 
force was the first to defect. The Guatemalan Army, 
fearing that the 1900 tons of Red arms from Stettin 
were actually intended for use by the communist-
dominated labor unions, refused to fight. An anti-
communist junta took over the country, and an 
overt Russian threat to the Western Hemisphere 
was averted, at least for the present. 
Some American citizens may find it disturbing 
and even noxious for their Government to engage in 
such clandestine activity in faraway Stettin and 
Puerto Barrios. In the live-and-let-live days after 
World War I, the late Henry L. Stimson disbanded 
the "lack Chamber" of State Department code 
experts, because "gentlemen don't read other peo-
ple's mail." Today, in this period of cold war after 
World War II, our Government is deeply involved 
countering Red espionage as it threatens the West-
ern democracies. 
On assignment by The Saturday Evening Post 
these two Washington correspondents set out twelve 
months ago to cover the Central Intelligence Agency 
from every angle consistent with national security 
and the public interest. Our every interview, includ-
ing talks with Government officials concerned with 
intelligence operations, and congressional leaders, 
plus exhaustive research, has had the aim of answer-
ing the question: "What is the CIA up to?"

Ex-CIA boss Walter Bedell Smith with Sen. Joe 
McCarthy, who has said the CIA is Red-infiltrated. 
Briefly, the answer must be stated like this: We 
are too prone to view our conflict with Russia in 
terms of the worry, "When will the Reds attack us 
militarily?" We strain to arm ourselves, thinking. 
only in terms of communist atomic bombs hurtling 
down on the democratic West from supersonic 
planes. The Russians hold that fear over us while 
they craftily go about their business of taking over 
target countries from within. We plan to defend our-
selves on land, on sea and in the air, when what we 
must also do is combat the communist enemy un-
derground, where he uses the fourth dimension of 
war ?infiltration, subversion and conspiracy. 
The free world saw Poland engulfed by commu-
nism. That easy Russian conquest was gained, at 
Yalta, by deceit. Czechoslovakia lived briefly, after 
the war, in the illusion of peaceful coexistence with 
communism. But Czechoslovakia suddenly found 
her free people submerged under Russian infiltra-
tion. American military aid to the French in Indo-
china far outstripped in amount, cost and quality 
the armed support even the Vietminh rebels by the 
Chinese communists. But the Reds enveloped a vast 
area containing 12,000,000 people, the city of Hanoi 
and the rich rice fields of Northern Vietnam largely 
by infiltrating, softening up and swallowing. 
So it was? almost ? in Guatemala. Communist 
agitators, operating in the role of reformers, began 
infiltrating the public and private organizations of 
Guatemala as long as ten years ago. Agents indoc-
trinated in such institutions as the Marx-Engels-
Lenin School in Moscow, organized the peasants and 
workers on the banana plantations. Once in control 
of such mass groups, Reds soon took over the 
official press and radio of the Guatemalan Govern-
ment. Through the technique of the political popular 
front, they dictated to the Guatemalan congress 
and president. Most alarming was the fact that the 
communists had not simply oozed across a frontier 
into a contiguous territory, but they were able to 
leapfrog their subversion and infiltration across the 
Atlantic and Pacific oceans to Latin America and 
its vital Panama Canal. The CIA, working with 
"freedom forces" of Guatemalans, met the Reds 
early enough to hand Russia its defeat in Guatemala. 
.As of today, the intelligence experts who attempt 
?to gauge Russia's long-term intentions predict that 
the communists are not now prepared for military 
global conflict. That cautious assessment is based on 
information from behind the Iron Curtain which 
may be reported here only in bare-bone outline: 
Inside Russia: Despite the hard outer shell of 
Russia's military might ?a 4,000,000-man army, 
20,000-plane air force and nuclear weapons esti-
mated in four figures?all is not rosy within the 
U,S.S.R. Communist industry is progressing reason-
ably well, spurred by an intensive program to train 
young scientists and engineers. This drive threatens 
to outstrip us in the live-or-die field of technology. 
Food ?an all-important weapon in total war ? is a

vexing problem, due to a breakdown in the commu-
nist collective-farming system. The Soviet recently 
was forced to divert 100,000 workers from industry 
to agriculture. Premier Malenkov is in control, but 
he ordered the liquidation of Secret Police Chief 
L. P. Beria because Beria was plotting the eradica-
tion of Malenkov "in two or three days." On the day 
Beria was seized, Red Army tanks rumbled into the 
outskirts of Moscow, as they did the night that 
Stalin died. So Russia's committee form of govern-
ment, with its divided power, is not an easy form to 
maintain in a dictatorship. 
Conclusion: The Politburo is quite satisfied with 
the gains communism is making with the present 
Red technique of subvert and conquer. The men in 
the Kremlin cannot be certain, even if they launched 
open military warfare and won a global conflict, 
that their regime could survive the retaliatory wreck-
age and misery sure to be inflicted on the Russian 
population. The Red rulers have no thought of win-
ning a war for someone else. The U.S.S.R. is worried 
lest her major ally, communist China, get a little out 
of hand. Russia does not want to be dragooned into 
armed combat with the West by Mao Tse-tung, but 
prefers, if and when she wages war, to choose the 
time and place herself?probably not before 1957 or 
1958 at the earliest. 
The foregoing estimate of Russian plans and 
intentions is reported as no tidbit of gossip from the 
capital's cocktail-party circuit. It represents the 
warp and woof of our Government's foreign and 
domestic policy as patterned by the National Se-
curity Council. If our leaders had thought open war 
was imminent, the Administration would have spon-
sored no $7,400,000,000 reduction in Federal taxes 
at the recent session of Congress. Secretary of the 
Treasury George M. Humphrey would not be

conquests are being scored. This was 
the strategy in Guatemala, where we 
alerted "freedom forces" who were 
then able to drive the Reds to the sur-
face and hand them a sound defeat. If 
the communists had been permitted 
another year of unbridled subversion 
of the Guatemalan people, we might 
have faced the necessity of sending 
marines to reinforce the Panama Canal 
and to save Latin America. The subse-
quent propaganda windfall for Russia 
in her trumped-up diatribes against 
Yankee imperialism can easily be im-
agined. Such strategy, evolved from 
CIA's revelations of Soviet maneuvers, 
meets the communists in their own 
kind of subversive underground cold 
war, where a timely bit of American 
counterespionage may prevent a hot 
war. 
CIA's nerve center is not housed in 
one of the imposing, neo-Hellenic 
buildings which line Washington's 
Constitution Avenue from the White 
House to Capitol Hill. The locale is 
one that Hollywood might choose for a 
spy thriller. The main office is a 
colonial-type structure of red brick in 
the rundown Foggy Bottom section of 
the city. To the west, a brewery raises 
the turretlike towers of a pseudo castle 
on the banks of the Potomac. A 
honky-tonk organ grinds out jazz in a 
nearby roller-skating rink. The view 
to the east is blocked by the shabby 
back sides of an array of State Depart-
ment annexes, and, to the north the 
grimy shell of an abandoned gas works 
casts weird shadows on the surround-
ing slums. 
The main CIA building was dis-
guised until recently as the Depart-
ment of State Printing Office. Dulles 
discovered that the Washington tele-
phone directory listed: "Central In-
telligence Agency, 2430 E. St., E Xecu-
tive 3-6115." He found Washington 
sight-seeing guides halting their loaded 
buses on the street to point out to 
tourists that "there is the building 
where spies work." Dulles ordered a 
discreet sign posted: CENTRAL INTEL-
LIGENCE AGENCY. 
Publicity ends there. A mesh-wire 
fence, eight feet high and topped by 
three strands of barbed wire, runs 
around the clipped green lawn. Inside, 
when the Intelligence Advisory Com-
mittee meets, the doors are barred and 
locked. The typewriter ribbons and 
carbon papers used by stenographers 
to record the proceedings are locked 
overnight in safes. The wastebaskets 
are marked classified, their contents 
shredded and burned by special se-
curity officers. Meetings of this group 
are never mentioned in the nation's 
press or on radio or television. 
Although it operates off the record 
as far as the American public is con-
cerned, the CIA occupies thirty-odd 
buildings in the capital, maintains 
twenty-five domestic offices across the 
country on a twenty-four-hour basis, 
and finances unnumbered covert 
branches around the world to beg, buy 
or steal information on the Reds' war 
potential and intentions. 
CIA employees number between 
8000 and 12,000 anonymous men and 
women whose duties, salaries and even 
names never appear on published 
Government payrolls. The total cost 
of CIA operations runs several hundred 
million dollars a year. Dulles declines 
to discuss details of agency personnel 
and his budget, but if CIA employs 
10,000 persons, the payroll is half as 
large as the entire Department of 
State. 
The CIA will not, as it may not, con-
cede publicly that its employees and 
appropriations are used in what are 
popularly known as cloak-and-dagger 
operations. But it is significant that 
while Allen Dulles is not nearly so well 
known in this country as his brother, 
John Foster Dulles, he is probably 
much better known behind the Iron 
Curtain. His alleged exploits and dire 
deeds as an imperialist warmonger fill 
the columns of Pravda and the satellite 
press. Radio Moscow has linked him 
with every unfortunate communist 
leader who has gone to the gallows for 
"co-operation with the capitalistic 
West." He was paid a singular compli-
ment by Ilya Ehrenburg, the sharp-
tongued Kremlin propagandist. "Even 
October 30,1954 
if the spy, Allen Dulles, should arrive 
in heaven through somebody's absent-
mindedness," Ehrenburg wrote, "he 
would begin to blow up the clouds, 
mine the stars and slaughter the 
angels." 
If he desired to proceed with such 
celestial depredations, Dulles un-
doubtedly could find authority in Pub-
lic Law 110, the act passed by Congress 
and signed by President Truman on 
June 20, 1949, to make the CIA a more 
effective weapon to protect free nations 
from subversion. Under this virtually 
unbounded grant of personal authority, 
Dulles need not voucher his multi-
million-dollar appropriations. Actually, 
the director files routine Federal ex-
pense accounts for all "white" CIA 
operations, such as research. Dulles re-
ports to the Bureau of the Budget and 
to a small group of members of Con-
gress on an off-the-record basis for his 
secret, or "black," expenditures? but 
on a lump-sum area basis of so many 
dollars spent, say, in the Far East or 
Latin America. Since he has been 
director, Dulles has returned an un-
spent balance of his appropriation to 
the Treasury. 
Dulles may hire, pay and fire CIA 
personnel, under the law, without re-

The Best Player I Ever Coached 
T ALWAYS said there was a 
touch of genius in Dixie Howell. 
Even today, when you speak of 
great passing combinations in the 
South, you usually begin with 
Howell ?and his end mate, Don 
Hutson. Yet when Howell re-
ported at the University of Ala-
bama in 1931, he looked like any-
thing but a fabulous passer. 
Howell was a 150-pound end 
from the small town of Hartford, 
Alabama. We took him only on the 
recommendation of an alumnus 
in whose judgment we had great 
faith. Physically, Howell was un-
impressive. In his second week on 
the campus, he broke his leg. He 
never played freshman football. 
As a sophomore, he looked un-
dersized to be blocking 215-pound 
tackles. But he showed good 
speed, so we converted him to a 
left halfback in our Notre Dame 
box formation. He was No. 3 left 
half, and played very little until 
midseason. Then the top two left 
halfbacks were injured. Howell 
got his chance behind the first-
string line, and won the game that 
day. From then on, he was always 
No. 1. 
While he ran well and was an 
excellent punter, he gave no initial 
promise of becoming a good 
passer, much less a superb one. 
Howell's quick reactions proved 
the key to his football success. 
He could size up a situation in a 
split second, like my gifted Notre 
Dame teammate, George Gipp. 
This knack, important in all 
phases of football, is especially 
By FRANK THOMAS 
Late Head Coach, Alabama 
valizable to a passer. As Howell 
progressed, passing seemed to 
come to him as a natural thing. 
Howell probably hit his peak 
in the second quarter of our 1935 
Rose Bowl victory over Stanford. 
He ran back a punt twenty-five 
yards, setting up a touchdown 
which he later scored. He raced 
sixty-seven yards for another 
touchdown, and threw six passes 
for a total of eighty yards to 
make a third score. The final 
count was 29-13, and three of our 
four touchdowns were pretty 
much Howell. 
For a youngster who started 
out in college football as an under-
sized "catcher," he certainly 
wound up as a great "pitcher."

Bureau of the Budget. No more than 
ten or twelve congressmen, including 
Senators Saltonstall, of Massachusetts, 
and Russell, of Georgia, and Represen-
tEitiveslraher, ofi,New drk,anci 
of Missouri= members of the Armed 
Services and Appropriations subcom-
mittees whom Dulles briefs personally 
apd privately ?even realize that they 
are approving CIA funds when they 
cast their votes. So if size, cost and 
secrecy were the sole criteria for gaug-
ing the success of CIA, the country 
could sleep soundly tonight in the as-
surance that we have the right answers 
to Russian scheming. 
But during the recent session of Con-
gress, Sen. Mike Mansfield, a fair-
minded Democrat from Montana, stood 
on the Senate floor to cite what he 
called CIA "exploits which have been 
the subject of many whispered com-
plaints." He pointed to rumors that 
CIA had subsidized a Nazi-type or-
ganization in West Germany which had 
marked leaders of the Social Demo-
cratic political party for liquidation. 
The senator admitted that he could 
not vouch for his information, but he 
voiced suspicion that CIA was main-
taining the tatterdemalion remains of a 
Nationalist Chinese Army in Burma, 
despite Burmese protests to the United 
Nations, to make forays into Red 
China. 
Mansfield concluded his speech to a 
hushed and attentive Senate by intro-
ducing a resolution to establish a special 
watchdog committee to keep a con-
gressional eye? on Dulles' operations. 
Dulles adhered to his usual closed-
mouth policy of neither confirming nor 
denying such spoken or published re-
ports: To do so would offer attractive 
bait for Soviet fishing expeditions into 
our intelligence secrets. So the Mans-
field speech went unanswered. The re-
sult was that nineteen other Democrats 
and seven Republicans joined the sen-
ator as co-sponsors of his bill. 
This meant no specific faultfinding 
with CIA, as the senators admitted. 
Because of the hush-hush air surround-
ing the agency, they were voicing nat-
ural doubts over the efficiency of the 
administration of CIA, a political 
curiosity as to the number of jobholders 
on its unpublished payroll, and a ques-
tioning of the reliability of CIA's 
"national estimates." 
More recently, a direct attack on 
CIA came from Sen. Joseph R. Mc-
Carthy, who charged that the agency 
had been infiltrated by communists. 
The senator called the situation "even 
more dangerous than Red penetration 
of the Army Signal Corps' radar labora-
tories" at Fort Monmouth, New Jer-
sey. He announced that he would make 
CIA the next target of his Special In-
vestigating subcommittee. Flaunting 
his disregard of the presidential order 
safeguarding such executive secrets, 
McCarthy renewed his call on Federal 
employees to furnish him with confi-
dential information from restricted and 
delicate agency files. 
Dulles issued one of his rare public 
statements. He called the senator's 
charges false. He revealed that he had 
written McCarthy almost a year ago, 
asking for any specific allegations Mc-
Carthy had to offer on communists 
within the CIA, but the senator had 
not even acknowledged his letter. 
Dulles, expressing no doubt that Mc-
Carthy was seeking information from 
inside CIA, addressed a CIA orienta-
tion session with this ultimatum: "Any-
one giving Senator McCarthy CIA in-
formation will be fired." 
McCarthy went ahead with his in-
quiry, assigning the preliminary inves-
tigation to Donald A. Surine, even 
though the then McCarthy committee 
aide had been refused clearance by the 
Defense Department to see classified 
material. Mcgarthy .announced later 
that he had conferred with a "high 
elected official" of the Administration 
and agreed that public hearings on CIA 
would not be in the public interest, but 
he left for a vacation in Mexico, de-
claring his determination to probe our 
intelligence system. 
While McCarthy vacationed, the 
Administration cannily froze him out 
of new Red-hunting headlines. The 
Hoover Government-reorganization 
commission announced that a special 
task force would examine CIA. The 
survey, beginning in the fall of 1954, 
was placed under the direction of re-
tired Gen. Mark W. Clark. 
A previous Hoover survey, made in 
1949, when CIA was two years old, held 
that the agency "had not yet achieved 
the desired degree of proficiency and 
dependability in its estimates" for the 
National Security Council?so Mc-
Carthy could not charge "whitewash." 
During the hearing into his controversy 
with the Army, the senator had singled 
out General Clark for special praise ? 
so he could not cry "hand-picked judge." 
The senator gave up and pledged that 
he would transmit his information on 
CIA to General Clark. 
This is the first of three articles on the CIA. 
Next week, this exclusive report reveals the truth 
about communist efforts to infiltrate the agency.
