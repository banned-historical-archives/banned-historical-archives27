 MEMORANDUM FOR:    Director of Central Intelligence
 Deputy Director of Central Intelligence
 THROUGH            Deputy Director for National Foreign Assessment
 National Intelligence Officer for Warning
 FROM               John H. Holdridge
 National Intelligence Officer for East Asia
 SUBJECT            Warning Assessment:  East Asia
 The following items were discussed by the Community
 Representatives at the 18 June Warning Meeting.
 1. Japan -- Analysts were reluctant to predict the outcome of
 the 22 June general elections, although they tended toward a
 victory by the Liberal Democratic Party.   The possibility was
 mentioned of a coalition government emerging made up of the LDP
 plus representation from the Democratic Socialist Party or the
 Komeito.  No change in Japan's current policies and relationship
 with the US was foreseen.   It was noted that Nakasone, for years a
 seeker of the Prime Ministership, now at last has a chance to
 succeed.  Nakasone is known to favor greater Japanese attention to
 defense, but it was pointed out that even with him as Prime Minister
 Japan's current economic problems and monetary shortages will inhibit
 increased defense expenditures.                          25X1
 2. Korea -- In the ROK, General Chon Doo Huan's recent activities
 suggested to analysts that he is using the textbook written by Park
 Chong Heel                                               25X1

 battered state o  the two political parties -- the DRP is decimated
 and although the NDP, while still in being, is weakened -- which
 might require him to organize a new party.   It was s eculated that
 if Kim Yong San ran against Chon, Kim would win. 25X1

 ere is aiso the 25)(41
 question of how the public will accept a new constitution containing
 elements of the old Yushin constitution, e.g                 rong one-man rule and
 government control of the National Assembly. F1 25X1
 4.  Analysts agreed that for the moment, at least, the country is
 quiet.   Student activitists had been arrested or frightened into
 passivity and the Kwangju riots have not caused people outside the
 Cholla provinces to react.  Nevertheless, the government will need to
 allow a number of schools to open soon and other unknown factors could
 go to work and create problems.   There is a possibility of
 assassination and terrorist activities generated by Kwangju students.
 The government is watching the schools, and there is a brigade of
 special forces assigned to the campuses. F __I                          25X1
 5.   Analysts termed the economic situation less than good, but
 commented also that economic activity was beginning to pick up again.
 The visit of Ex-Im Bank President Moore had helped in this regard by
 restoring a measure of economic confidence.   Commercial banks are
 following a wait and see policy with respect to further investments,
 but have lots of money available and are conscious of the need to
 protect investments already made.   The unemployment figure stands at
 five percent, but there have been no further labor demonstrations;
 workers appear to understand that if they demand too much they will be
 worse off. II                                                                25X1
 6.  With the security situation quiet, US-ROK relations are
 satisfactory.   The Combined Forces Command is functioning, and ROK
 troops used to suppress the Kwangju riots are back to normal positions.
 US-ROK military cooperation has resumed.   General Wickham's deputy in
 the CFC has been appointed to the Special Committee National Security
 Matters (the new military  dominated control mechanism) but may be
 removed. lI                                                                   25X1
 7.  In the North, analysts had not perceived any unusual military
 indicators.   Troops were engaged

 had occurred elsewhere.   This could be read as an indication that
 the North Koreans were "'Y ng their civilian population better
 prepared for war.
 8.   China -- Following up last month's discussion, analysts
 called attention to possible frictions at the top on economic issues,
 as indicated by a spate of Peoples Daily editorials.   For example,
 criticisms had been leveled at unnamed people who had favored a
 faster pace of modernization -- an issue on which Hua Guofeng is
 vulnerable, in addition to his vulnerability on the question of
 material incentives.  Nevertheless, the tone of such editorials was
 9.   Analysts assume that Deng Xiaoping would indeed resign from
 his governmental position in August, taking Li Xiannian, Yeh Jianying,
 and perhaps Hua Guofeng with him.   Hua would thus be left with only
 the Party Chairmanship.   It appeared from editorials and other evidence
 that the top leaders were presently thrashing out issues before the
 major meetings scheduled for later this year.   Analysts referred to
 the differences between Hua Guofeng's and Zhao Ziyang's  definitions of
 Zhao's duties as Vice Premi        ich suggested that Hua might try to
 hang on to the Premiership.                                                    25X1
 10.   On the subject. of Sino-US relations, analysts felt that the
 Chinese are quiet satisfied with the present state of affairs.   The
 4 June Holbrooke speech and Geng Biao's visit to the US had generated
 favorable Chinese comments, along with statements affirming coincidence
 of strategic views between the two countries.   On the Geng Biao visit
 itself, the Peoples Daily commentary spoke first of all about this
 coincidence of views, and accorded less importance to US arms sales.
 There were, however, the "u      differences between the US and China
 on Kampuchea and Pol Pot.                                                             25X1
 11.   As an indicator of the current state of Sino-US relations,
 analysts commented on the large number of people traveling from each
 country to the other.  This had also occurred, it was pointed out, in
 the case of France, when in the early days of Sino-French relations
 similar flow of visits had occurred.   The present volume of US-PRC
 travel nevertheless was much greater.                                              25X1
 12.   One analyst remarked upon the key role which Hong Kong is
 assuming in Chinese policy.   The Chinese are putting their representatives
 into Hong Kong business and commercial concerns in significant numbers,
 probably to train their people in business practices but also suggesting
 that Hong Kong has a long-term part to play in China's economic develop-
 ment.                                                             25X1

 13.   Commenting upon the Chinese refusal to respond to Soviet
 feelers on improving Sino-Soviet relations, analysts judged that
 Beijing's present policies, including expanded relations with the US,
 are more valuable to the Chinese then achieving some easing of tensions
 with the Soviets along the border.   There was agreement that a failure
 to coneinue to realize such benefits could generate some pressures for
 a change, although there was no sign of this now.   There was some
 speculation that if the Soviets revealed that their bid had been
 rejected, a considerable degree of ferment could be generated within
 the Chinese Foreign Ministry and PLA.  Apropos of possible potential
 problems in US-Communist relations, attention was called to the
 Peoples Daily editorial critizing Governor Reagan's China policy._5X1
 14.  No particular change in the Soviet OB along the Chinese
 border had been observed, except for the addition of a new Backfire
 regiment.                                                                       25X1
 25X1
 15.  Philippines -- Reference was made to the reported manifesto
 of anti-Marcos activities provided to the Department of State by
 Senator Aquino, which called for a united front including the
 Communists against Marcos as well as armed demonstrations.   Analysts
 recalled that a similar manifesto had occurred during elections some
 two years ago and this added nothing new.   It was agreed that the
 Philippine situation merited close watching, however. Q             25X1
 16.   Indochina -- Analysts addressed the security situation in
 Kampuchea, noting that the Vietnamese and Heng Semrin forces were
 having difficulties in maintaining control over the roads, although
 the level of DK attacks had not reached a point requiring special
 attention.   Eastern Kampuchea was said to be fairly secure, but
 communications elsewhere were being hit; e.g., Route 4 struck one
 time, and a press report of an attack on a train NW of Phnom Penh
 confirmed.  Not all these attacks were attributable to the DI:; some
 were caused by elements which were essentially bandits.  Heavy rains
 were now occurring, and Route 6 was under water.  WN casualties were
 evidently fairly low, and Vietnamese troops were undertaking operations
 of their own.   On t           hand, whole units of Heng Samrin troops
 had been deserting.                                                              25X1
 17.   The DK forces were                          ellsu plied with smaa5X1
 arms and mines, with the expectation of receiving       additional ton225X1
 of arms aid by the end of the summer.  Hence they were well able to do
 what they would do -- intensify operations against the Vietnamese.

 ?
 So far, though, this intensification had not occurred.   There was no
 disagreement over the thesis that the DK forces would be in a more
 difficult position in the next dry season if they failed to take
 18.  Considerable discussion ensued over the size of the DK forces,
 with one view maintaining that the total was around 50,000 but with
 the upper limit of combat or main force units being 30-35,000 with the
 rest consisting of transport troops, militia, etc.   Questioned closely
 on the methodology for putting forth this view, the analyst concerned
 outlined the steps through which his iudgment was reached. 94;)(1

 come up with on DK strength was an
 19.   On the political side, it was reported that   25X1
 the Chinese were not wedded to the DK. 25X1
 There was a possibility from this and some other similar indications
 of more Chinese aid going to the KPLF or the Khmer Serai.   The Thai
 had been trying to bring together Son Sann and Khieu Samphan.   The
 Heng Samrin units which had deserted had gone over Son Sann,not to the
 DK, and the Son       also claimed penetration into every part of
 Kampuchea.                                                                   25X1
 20.  Attention was also called to signs of possible increased Chinese
 attention to Northern Laos as an area for stepped-up
 activity,                                                                    25X1
 where the Lao refugees accepted by China from camps in Thailand had been
 relocated, to areas along the Chinese border with Laos.   Conceivably
 the Chinese were training some of these refugees for guerrilla operations
 in Laos. II                                                                  25X1

 22.   On the subject of the forthcoming ASEAN Foreign Ministers
 Meeting in Kuala Lumpur, analysts assumed that the main question which
 Secretary Muskie would be asked was how the US would vote in the next
 UN General Assembly on Kampuchean representation.  Besides this, there
 was an underlying question on the score of US-Chinese relations and
 what they entailed for Southeast Asia.   The Indonesians and Malaysians
 were not persuaded that the developing relationships b      n the US
 and China were not being undertaken at their expense.                   25X1
 23.  Analysts suggested that the Thai might run into problems
 connected with the new effort to repatriate Kampuchean refugees from
 the camps located in Thailand.  Nobody much was anxious to return --
 only 500 to 600 people had agreed to go -- and the Vietnamese were
 also objecting.   There was a chance that the Vietnamese might try to
 scare some of the repatriates back into Thailand.II                  25X1
 24.   The Soviet presence in Vietnam was touched upon briefly.   It
 appeared that the Soviets were concentrating this presence at Cam Ranh
 Bay by moving                           there from Danang.             25  1
 There was no indication to suggest 1
 a     e Soviets were in any way cutting back on their aid to Vietna 5X1
 25.   Thailand -- The performance of Prime Minister Prem since he
 assumed office was summed up as not being too good.   So far Prem had
 escaped serious criticism, but a critical point could come in about three
 months more unless he faced up to some of Thailand's pressing problems.
 This point in time would coincide with the date of announcing new       X
 military promotions, which could also cause additional trouble for P
 rem.
