 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE             June 7, 1965
 As a naval officer and a native son of
 Massachusetts, President Kennedy well un-
 derstood the importance of our water re-
 sources.  He  recognized that  our  Nation
 could ill afford and need not afford dis-
 astrous floods which wreak havoc to our
 cities  and  lay waste  to  our farmlands.
 President Kennedy knew the power of these
 streams could be preserved for productive
 uses.   He recognized the constantly increas-
 ing power needs of an expanding and dy-
 namic economy and knew that development
 of water resources could provide the neces-
 sary energy to tame the wheels of progress.
 President Kennedy foresaw that a Nation
 with constantly increasing leisure time must
 have additional recreational facilities,  an-
 other byproduct of the appropriate develop-
 ment of our water resources.  He saw the in-
 herent danger in pollution of the air we
 breathe and the water we drink, and he was
 the champion of causes similar to those now
 crying out for development of such dams in
 our State as the Joanna or Cannon, and such
 basins as the Meramec, Chariton, and Grand
 River.
 As a stanch supporter and a great ad-
 mirer of John F. Kennedy, during his service
 as President of the United States, I take the
 greatest pride in participating in this event-
 the  dedication  of  a  Kennedy - Memorial
 plaque, to stand forever as a symbol of re-
 spect to a man who lived, and worked, and
 died, fightirig for the democratic principles
 in which he so deeply believed.
 I thank you for your attention.
 (Mr. POAGE (at the request of Mr.
 KREBS)  was granted permission to ex-
 tend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD  and  to  include  extraneous
 matter.)

 fluoridated water, and within the next
 few months it will be made available to
 an additional 10.5 or 11 million persons.
 Both New York City with some 8 million
 inhabitants and Detroit with another 2.5
 million will insure better dental health
 for their residents by following the lead
 of other farsighted cities in adopting
 community water fluoridation. The edi-
 torial also points out that, contrary to
 rumor, there have been no reports of any
 major disaster occurring anywhere from
 excess fluoridation.
 The U.S. Public Health Service, charged
 with the responsibility of safeguarding
 the Nation's health, has since 1952 urged
 people of this country to take advantage
 of the proven effectiveness of water fluo-
 ridation in reducing dental decay. Cer-

 have closed their eyes to the facts and
 have worked in opposition to this pro-
 gressive measure.  However, virtually
 every reputable scientific organization in
 this and other countries has approved
 and endorsed fluoridation of public wa-
 ter supplies. I am proud to report that
 in the State of Rhode Isand, 88 percent
 of the population drinks fluoridated wa-
 ter.
 I hope that in the near future all of
 the citizens of our Great Society can en-
 joy the benefits of this public health
 measure.
 Mr. Speaker, I commend to the atten-
 tion of our colleagues an editorial which
 appeared in the Woonsocket, R.I., Call
 and Evening Reporter on April 28. It is
 a tribute to this fine newspaper's sense
 of public responsibility.  This editorial
 is fair and objective and leaves little
 doubt in the reader's mind of the facts
 about fluoridation. I, therefore, include
 the editorial verbatim in the RECORD:

 WATER AND TEETH
 The SPEAKER pro tempore.  Under
 previous order of the House, the gentle-
 man from Rhode Island [Mr. FOGARTY],
 is recognized for 10 minutes.
 Mr. FOGARTIY.  Mr. Speaker, the
 Woonsocket Call recently commented ed-
 itorially on the problem of dental caries,
 a disease suffered by 95 percent of the
 American people, and on the use of water
 fluoridation to eliminate this needless
 dental decay.
 The editorial discusses the fact that
 67 million Americans today are drinking
 WATER AND TEETH
 As little explosive pockets of opinion about
 water fluoridation get into the news on oc-
 casion, a trend is quietly developing, it seems,
 so that the latest figures from Washington
 show some 67 million consumers of such
 water, including us in Woonsocket.
 In other words, approximately one-third
 of the Nation is drinking water either ar-
 tificially treated with fluorides, or water that
 is natural in this element.  Dr. Donald J.
 Galagan, an assistant surgeon general with
 the U.S. Public Health Service, and chief of
 its division on dental public health and re-
 sources, said that within a few months, "an
 additional 10.5 to 11 million persons will be
 drinking   artificially   fluoridated   water."
 About 7 million citizens already drink wet
 stuff that is by nature fluoridated, he noted.
 It is something of a major decision to treat
 local water supplies, some medical and other
 authorities being opposed to it, supposedly
 on the ground that fluorides are poisonous in
 certain doses.  So, too, is aspirin, it may be

 The trend toward water fluoridation as a
 means of avoiding dental decay has been
 steady, according to Dr. Galagan, ever since
 initiation of the process in 1945.  Strangely
 enough, proposals to fluoridate more often
 lose than win when put to popular vote.
 To vote on fluoridation seems to be the
 democratic way, provided both sides are per-
 mitted to present their cases.  It is worth
 reflecting, however, that there are 2,792 com-
 unities with fluoridation, and that the com-
 m nity increase in 1962, 1963, and last year,
 124, 236, and 180, respectively.

 THE VIETNAM ISSUE
 SPEAKER pro tempore.  Under
 previous order of the House, the gen-
 tleman from California [Mr. COHELAN]
 is recognized for 5 minutes.
 1        COHELAN. Mr. Speaker, it is no
 news and-no exaggeration to say that the
 most critical problem confronting this
 country today is the crisis in Vietnam.
 It is also one of the most complex issues
 of our time; an issue which defies the
 quick andeasy "answers" of withdrawal
 or total escalation which offer no real
 solution at all.
 One of the most thoughtful and per-
 suasive statements on this subject was
 made 2 weeks ago by the very able and
 distinguished  professor  of  political
 science at the University of California,
 Dr. Robert Scalapino.  Professor Scala-
 pino is chairman of the department of
 political  science  on the university's
 Berkeley campus, and is one of the most
 knowledgeable men in the entire coun-
 try on the problems of southeast Asia.
 His comments, therefore, deserve close
 attention and consideration.
 Professor Scalapino has made a num-
 ber of important points, a few of which
 I would like to emphasize briefly.
 The National Liberation Front, he has
 stressed, is a movement directed and
 controlled in all of its important aspects
 by Communists outside of Vietnam.  Is
 it not revealing, he has asked, that al-
 most none of the top Buddhist, Can Dai,
 Hoa Hao, Catholic, or Dal Viet leaders
 have joined this supposed "patriotic
 front"?
 An impressive aspect of the Vietcong's
 organization, he reminds us, involves
 coercion.  Since  1959, Dr. Scalapino
 points out, Vietcong terrorists, operating
 under orders from Hanoi, have killed
 between 6,000 and 10,000 village and dis-
 trict leaders.                                                                                                In the first 4 months of
 this year alone more than 260 were liqui-
 dated, some in the most horrible fash-
 ion.  Is it any wonder that progress on
 the local community level has been halt-
 ing and slow?

 between Peiping and Hanoi has been ex-
 ceedingly close, and both parties have pur-
 sued a totally militant line.
 POLICY ALTERNATIVES
 How do these facts affect the alternatives
 of policy confronting us?  Let us look first
 at the arguments favoring withdrawal. Some
 say that if we were to allow the Communists
 to take all of Vietnam, Ho would become
 another Tito, and help in the containment
 of China.  I regard this argument as very
 dubious. In the first place, Ho himself is 75
 years of age, in indifferent health, and, what-
 ever his personal views, not likely to be ac-
 tive for long. As just noted, the rising Com-
 munist leaders of the north are the young
 pro-Chinese elements, and men like Truong
 Chinh, whose name-Long March--signifies
 his allegiance. It should be remembered that
 if Vietnam has a long history of struggle
 against Chinese domination, it has an equally
 long history of accommodation to Chinese
 power. More Important, Titoism was a prod-
 uct of a true balance of power and of certain
 historical circumstances. Tito quite literally
 exists between East and West; no such bal-
 ance of power will exist in southeast Asia if
 we withdraw. Nor are the Vietnamese inter-
 ests as limited as those of Tito.  Hanoi claims
 control over the Communist movements of
 this entire region and if it is victorious in
 South Vietnam, it will certainly exercise its
 Claim in Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand, at
 least.
 The great argument for withdrawal is that
 it will prevent war, and in some measure,
 put us into harmony with the force of 'Asian
 nationalism.  Let me discuss the second
 argument first.  Of course there is criticism
 of our Vietnam policy in Asia, as there is in
 America.  It is simply not true,' however, to
 imply that the non-Communist leaders of
 Asia want us to withdraw from the Asian.

 pie against the' establishment of absolute
 monarchy.  However, the mere formation of
 a counterbalance to a king is enough protec
 tion.  Therefore, the, ancient Athenians, un-
 der the guidance of Solon in 496 $.C, 'made
 a constitution, the formation'of which Is de-
 scribed by Aristotle.  John Locke,' whose
 works .were an"_irispiration for the Declara-
 tion of Independence, wrote in 1690, "'What-
 ever form the comrnonw6'alth Is under, the
 ruling power ought to govern by' declared
 and receivev~l laws, and not by extemporary
 dictates and undetermined resolutions," so
 that "the rulers, too, (be) kept within their
 due bounds, and not to be tempted by the
 power they have in their hands to' employ
 government were expounded upon by Baron
 de Montesquieu in 1747 when he wrote "To
 forma moderate government it is necessary
 to combine the several powers; to regulate,
 temper, and set them in motion; to give, as
 it were a ballast to one, in order to counter-
 poise the other.  This is the masterpiece of
 legislation; rarely produced by hazard, and
 seldom attained by prudence."
 He clearly recognized the merits of a re-
 publican form of _government."Liberty is
 generally said to reside in republics * * *
 while democratic states are not in their own
 nature free "  He, saw the complete and eter-
 nal antithesis 'of republican and totalitarian
 governments; since "In republican govern-
 ments men are all equal; equal they are also
 in despotic governments in the former be-
 cause they have everything; in the latter
 because they are nothing." Finally, in 1785,
 only 2 years before the Constitutional Con-
 vention, Immanuel Kant wrote "the only
 rightful constitution is that of a pure re-
 public." bur farseeing forefathers' were very
 cognizant of the words of these great philos-
 ophers of the past.  They knew as did Aris-
 totle that "That which is common to the
 greatest number has the least care bestowed
 upon. it" and its corollary, expressed by
 Locke: "The supreme power cannot take from
 any man, any part of his property `without
 his own consent.  For the preservation of
 prdpevty being the end of government, and
 that for which men into society, it neces-
 sarily supposes and requires that the people
 should have,-property * * *.  Desiring to
 protect individual freedom and liberty, they
 realized that "A government may be so con-
 stituted, as no man shall be compelled to do
 things which the law does not oblige him,
 nor forced to'abstain from things which the
 law permits."  Therefore the United States
 of America was created as a constitutional
 republic.  The creators of the Constitution
 produced a document uniquely adaptable to
 the exigencies of our complex changing na-
 tion.                It cannot become outmoded as some
 charged:
 To suggest this would be to say that the
 entire #ange' of man's experience from Plato
 to Aristotle, to Locke and Montesquieu, and
 to Jefferson and Madison, is not applicable to
 modern times. 'It is to arrogate oneself above
 the wisdom of the combined philosophers of
 the last 25 centuries.  The Constitution,
 through separation of powers, and a system
 of checks and balances, protects all citizens
 against 'a cumulation of power in one person
 or group of persons. Edward Gibbon wrote
 in "TheDecline and Fall .of the Roman E'm-
 pire," "lhe principles of a free constitution
 are irrevocably` lost when the legislative
 power is dominated by the executive."  Also
 being aware of 1l~Iontesquieu's dictum warn-
 ing, "When the legislative and executive
 powers a re united' in the same person, there
 can be no liberty," the Convention estab-
 lished the ];'residential veto, and congres-
 sional overriding of this by a two-thirds
 majority "Provision forim eachment of the
 President by congress was also included.
 Montesquieu and Gibbon were also worried
 about judicial excesses. "There is no liberty
 if the judiciary power be not separated from
 the legislative and executive * * * for 'the
 judges would then be the legislator"  Gib-
 bon believed, "The ' discretion ofthe judge Is
 the first engine of tyranny."  However, "In'
 republics, the very nature of the constitution
 requires the judge to follow the'letter of the
 law; otherwise the law might be explained
 to the prejudice of'every citizen, in cases
 where their honor, property, or life is con-
 cerned."  To ameliorate this, the delegates
 provided for the Impeachment of the Justices
 of the Supreme Court, and also for amend-
 ments nullifying Supreme Court decisions.
 Ranking in importance with, other areas
 of the Constitution Is the Bill of Rights.
 These first 10 amendments provide guaran-
 tees of freedom and liberty for all citizens
 in all spheres of life.  They include freedom
 of speech, religion, and press, the right to
 bear arms, the right to a jury trial in civil
 cases.  However, the 10th amendment which
 reserves the powers to the States not dele-
 gated the Federal Government, has been
 practically usurped by clause 18 of section 8,
 article 1. This, the so-called elastic clause,
 has been used by the Federal Government to
 take over many States rights and functions.
 Moreover, while the fifth amendment is be-
 ing  greatly  abused by Communists  and
 fellow travelers who do not wish to answer
 questions of congressional investigators, or-
 ganizations of American citizens exercising
 their right to keep and bear arms are being
 harassed.
 The American people should awake to the
 gradual disintegration of their freedoms re-
 sulting from the concommitant destruction
 of the Constitution by unconstitutional laws
 and practices, as well as de facto legislation
 by the Supreme Court.   While telling of
 Coriolanus, Plutarch wrote, "For it was well
 and truly said that the first destroyer of the
 liberties of the people is he who first gave
 them bounties and largesses."  Reiterating
 this in 1762, Jean Jacques Rousseau prophe-
 sied, "Make gifts of money and you will not
 be  long without  chains."   All Americans
 know that welfare comes from income tax,
 but how many know that Rousseau also
 wrote, "I hold enforced labor to be less op-
 posed to liberty than taxes"?
 Apparently the apathy of Americans has
 sunk to the depth described by Plato when
 he said, "The greatest ignorance is when a
 man hates that which he nevertheless thinks
 to be good and noble, and loves and em-
 braces that which he knows to be unright-
 eous and evil."  America must escape the
 prophecy of Rousseau: "As soon as any man
 says of the affairs of the state: What does it
 matter to me? the state may be given up
 for lost."  Shall It be written in 1984 per-
 haps that, "Truly there is no great wisdom
 in knowing, and no great difficulty in telling
 after the evil has happened; but to have
 foreseen the remedy at the time would have
 taken a much wiser head than ours"? How-
 ever, there is one clear and evident remedy,
 of which all informed and patriotic Ameri-
 cans are aware.  The remedy is a return to
 the principles of our Republic's Constitution,
 the greatest safeguard ever devised against
 tyranny.
 Tabulation of Public Opinion Poll; Con-
 aecticut's Fourth _ Congressional Dis-
 trict
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. DONALD J. IRWIN
 OF CONNzCrICUT
 IN TEE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, May 27, 1965
 Mr. IRWIN.  Mr. Speaker, I wish to
 call the attention of my colleagues to
 the results of a survey of my district,
 A2915
 Connecticut's Fourth Congressional Dis-
 trict.  Nearly 9,000 people took the time
 and trouble to answer.  And, for the
 most part, they agree with me: They like
 the programs of the Johnson adminis-
 tration.
 The administration's approach in Viet-
 nam was supported by 2 to 1 over the
 nearest alternative.
 The  administration's  proposal  for
 gradual elimination of the national ori-
 gins quota on immigration also was en-
 dorsed by a 2 to 1 margin.
 And more than half of those expressing
 an opinion favored either the adminis-
 tration's original medicare bill or its
 substitute version, passed by the House,
 providing for hospital, doctor and major
 medical expenses.
 This is good showing by any standards,
 arid. it becomes more impressive when
 you consider the Republican leanings of
 the Fourth Congressional District, which,
 when it sent me back to Congress last
 fall, made me the only Democrat in the
 20th century ever to win a second term in
 the district.
 The results are as follows:
 I. Vietnam: What approach do you favor
 for the United States in Vietnam?
 1. Expand  war  into  Communist  North
 Vietnam and go all-out to win, 25.3 percent.
 2. Military support of South Vietnam, in-
 cluding attacks in North Vietnam, until a
 satisfactory settlement can be negotiated,
 50.1 percent:
 3. Restrict efforts to South Vietnam and
 negotiate best settlement possible, 10.5 per-
 cent.
 4. Withdraw troops and advisers immedi-
 ately and let Vietnamese solve their own
 problems, 6.9 percent.
 5. None of the above, 2.4 percent.
 Blank, 4.3 percent.
 II. Immigration:  The administration has
 proposed gradual elimination of the national
 origins quota system, and replacing it with
 a system favoring skilled workers and rela-
 tives of people already in the United States.
 1. The administration's proposal, 57.4 per-
 cent.
 2. No limitations on immigration, 4.7 per-
 cent.
 3. Present system, 21.8 percent.
 4. No immigration, 5.2 percent.
 5. None of the above, 5.8 percent.
 Blank, 5.3 percent.
 III. Transportation: The New Haven Rail-
 road as it now stands cannot continue com-
 muter  operations much longer.   Do you
 favor:
 1. Expanded bus service instead of com-
 muter railroad, 3.4 percent.
 2. Letting  private  group  try to provide
 commuter service, 17.2 percent.
 3. A  multistate  authority  with  Federal
 and local assistance running the railroad or
 contracting commuter service, 62.7 percent.
 4. Having the  Federal Government pick
 up deficit and run the railroad, 9 percent.
 5. None of the above, 3.5 percent.
 Blank, 4.2 percent.
 IV. Medical  care  for elderly:  Which of
 the following approaches to medical care
 for those over 65 do you favor:
 1. Administration proposal, financed by
 payroll taxes, providing hospital and nursing
 home care, home health care visits, and out-
 patient diagnostic services, 27.6 percent.
 2. AMA proposal, financed by Federal-State
 funds and participant contributions to pri-
 vate insurance companies, providing volun-
 tary  comprehensive health coverage, 25.5
 percent.
 3. House Republican leadership proposal,
 financed by Federal-State funds and partici-
 pant  contributions  to  national  insurance

 The Agricultural Situation in California
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 or
 HON. EDWARD J. DERWINSKI
 OF rLLINOI5
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, June 3, 1965
 Mr. DERWINSKI.  Mr. Speaker, the
 gentleman from California [Mr. TAL-
 coTT] is directing our attention to a sit-
 uation that merits the attention of all
 Members. The artificially created man-
 power shortage for which the, adminis-
 tration-, and in particular' Labor Secre-
 tary Wirtz, is responsible, has had re-
 percussions throughout the entire coun-
 try.          This situation described by the
 gentleman f'rom' California adversely af-
 fects not only-producers but consumers
 throughout the country.
 The producers of vegetables in my dis-
 trict are indirectly feeling the adverse
 results of the administration's indiffer-
 ence to the facts of life as they pertain
 to farm labor.
 For years U.S. citizens whose normal
 residences are in the Southwest States
 move up to the Midwest during growing
 seasons to care and harvest the vegetable
 crops.  A substantial number this year
 have gone to California where theyhave
 failed to meet the real manpower needs.
 In so doing, a manpower shortage Is be-
 ginning to develop in midwestern farm
 regions.
 In addition, Mr. Speaker, I anticipate
 numerous economic and social problems
 that will beset us from the redevelopment
 of the "wetbacks"-illegal entrants from
 Mexico.  In past years I have struggled
 to aid individuals who have become vic-
 timized by legal complications caused by
 illegal entry into the country. When the
 bracero program was effectively func-
 tioning, the problem of illegal entry
 vanished.
 ited States in Vietnam To Stop Red
 China
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. E. Y. BERRY
 OF SOUTH DAKOTA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, June 7, 1 965
 Mr. BERRY.                     Mr. Speaker, at this
 stage in our history a noisy, radical mi-
 nority of college students are calling for
 this Nation to abandon its defense com-
 mitments across the world and to pull
 back from the threat of communism.
 This vocal minority has alarmed the
 American people, because their irrespon-
 sible comments have appeared to drown
 out the majority of students who are
 standing by their Nation in its times of
 danger; many of this majority have al-
 ready given their lives for freedom in
 Vietnam and the Dominican Republic.
 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to put in
 the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD an editorial
 from a South Dakota college newspaper
 which expresses the opinion of the re-
 sponsible majority of our college stu-
 dents. I am proud of the South Dakota
 Collegian of the South Dakota State Uni-
 versity for expressing sentiments which
 recognize the magnitude of the Commu-
 nist threat in southeast Asia.
 The enclosed editorial "United States
 in Vietnam To Stop Red China," from
 the South Dakota Collegian, May 20,
 1965, South Dakota State University,
 follows:
 UNITED STATES ITS VIETNAM To STOP
 RED  CHINA
 Students and professors on university cam-
 puses across the Nation are jumping on the
 bandwagon in protest of our role In the war
 in Vietnam.  They usually follow the line of
 thinking that "it's not our war, it's thou-
 sands of miles away, and therefore we should
 get out as soon as possible."
 Why is America involved in the Vietnam
 conflict?   Our  Federal  Government  has
 maintained that we are there because the
 South Vietnam Government invited us there
 to help defend its country from Communist
 terrorists and invaders.  This is true and is,
 on the surface, a pretty noble reason.  But
 almost anyone who has studied the situation
 must agree that the most important reason
 we are there is to help contain the advance
 of Communist China.
 Red China's expansionist policy has only
 one goal: world domination.  Southeast Asia
 is only the first step.  Control of southeast
 Asia will alleviate Red China's biggest prob-
 lem,  700  million  hungry,  crowded  people
 within her borders.  China's military efforts
 have taken away resources badly needed for
 economic   and  agricultural  development.
 She has been forced in the past few years
 to buy millions of bushels of wheat from
 other countries to feed her people.  Thus
 southeast Asia, a rich rice-producing area, is
 an   important  price  to  the Red Chinese
 leaders.
 Our Government must feel that Vietnam
 is the logical place to assert our policy of
 containment.    The side effect of helping de-
 fend South Vietnam from Communist ag-
 gression Is used mainly to help qualify our
 presence here.
 Surely those who deplore our role in Viet-
 nam do not think the Red Chinese will go
 only as far as the shores of South Vietnam
 and Laos and simply call it quits.  This is
 just the first step in their drive to dominate
 the world.  From there, the Philippine Is-
 lands, Malaysia, Austrialia and Japan are tan-
 talizing targets.  After that, the progression
 is pretty evident.
 We know that we will be forced to stop
 the Communist drive someplace, sometime,
 if we are to survive as a democracy.  The
 sooner this is done, the better.  Red China's
 new-found nuclear power adds to the ur-
 gency of the inevitable task.
 Perhaps our action in Vietnam will pre-
 vent an even worse future confrontation.
 Perhaps it will accomplish nothing.  Free-
 dom has never come cheap and, looking at
 it realistically, it is better to stop freedom's
 greatest threat in already war-torn Vietnam
 than on the shores of Hawaii.-W.A.

 OF NORTH CAROLINA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, June 7, 1965
 Mr. LENNON.                                                        Mr. Speaker, a very
 significant occasion took place recently

 Only One Final Decision
 HON. CLAIR CALLAN
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, June 7, 1965
 Mr. CALL Al  Mr. Speaker, as an in-
 dication of the, widespread, support for
 the President's position on certain for-
 eign policy issues which have been under
 attack lately, the Lincoln Star has no
 parallel.  I believe that an editorial of
 June 2 was very indicative of the sym-
 pathetic`analyses which have been char-
 acteristic of. this Nation in the last few
 weeks.  I therefore, include it in the
 RECORD at this point:
 ONLY ONE FINAL DECISION
 The unique and often lonely role 'of 'the
 -President of the United States, was demon-
 strated by President Johnson at the com-
 mencement of his daughter, Luci, and her
 classmates.  Criticism of administration pol-
 icy is welcome, said the President, but in
 the end the decisions can be made by only
 one man.
 He said he makes his decisions no matter
 how "the transient winds of opinion blow."
 He was referring specifically to foreign pol-
 icy and the commitment of U.S. men and
 arms in Vietnam and the Dominican Repub-
 lic.  There isn't any question that Johnson
 knows this commitment Is an unpopular one.
 There is not an individual in the Nation
 who Wants this Nation to be fighting any-
 where.  They do not want American serv-
 icemen dying on foreign soil.  But Johnson
 also knows that It is not a popularity con-
 test in which he is engaged. He must do
 what he feelsia right,"whether it is popular
 or not. And then be ,must,}est. his case on
 the basis of need, the demand, of_ the times.
 He hopes that the American people, too,
 know the difi'orence between what might be
 desirable, and what is essential, , In the
 President's deciaiou, there is no room fpr
 the use of chancre, either,  He must proceed
 on the basis of what action, holds, the. greatest
 promise with the least risk,  What might be
 called. Jong shots are plentiful but not, as a
 part 61 any final reckonin
 It is a,lob'tliat demands the kind of bi
 partisan support our foreign policy has and
 the unclerstanciing that is a part of such sup-
 port.  Criticism, of course, is an  her essen-
 tial part of`'our"national life but it should
 not completely dominate the scene.
 Congress and Vietnam
 the extraordinary vacillations in Dominican
 policy have set off the present questioning
 at home and abroad.  The reluctance of Sec-
 retary of State Rusk to employ the full re-
 sources of his Department and give inde-
 pendent-advice, the meager use made by the
 HON. ROBERT W. KASTENMEIER                                 President of nonofficial task forces in the

 Mr.  KASTENMEIER.  Mr.  Speaker,
 the lead editorial in today's New York
 Times speaks eloquently for many Amer-
 icans in calling for more vigorous con-
 gessional interest in the Vietnam war.
 Congress has a responsible role to play
 in the conduct of our foreign policy.  By
 questioning, as the Times editorial does,
 the reluctance of Secretary Rusk to em-
 ploy the full resources of his department
 and give independent advice, the meager
 use of the President of nonofficial task
 forces in the foreign policy field, the
 overall dependence _ on military and in-
 telligence agencies, the reasons behind
 the, diyorce, l gtwe,cn the , allniinistration
 and the Nation's intellectuals, as well as
 the nature of the war and its conduct,
 Congress can perform a great service to
 the Republic.
 Debate  over Vietnam policies un-
 doubtedly will result in publicizing some
 differences of opinion between Congress
 and the President which were. largely
 glossed over by recent votes On additional
 appropriations for Vietnam.  The reso-
 lution of these differences, however, can
 only result in a more enlightened and
 strengthened ' foreign _ policy for  the
 United States.  p'urthelmore, although
 publicizing differences, may expose the
 day-to-day conduct of the war to some
 tactical disadvantage, the overall advan-
 tage to be gained from congressional de-
 bate in the conduct of our foreign policy
 greatly outweighs the tactical risks in-
 volved:
 Thus, while 28 Congressmen . recently
 requested Chairman  MORGAN _ of the
 House Foreign Affairs Committee to hold

 who agree such hearings would be in our

 sideration : of the. following New York
 Times, editorial. and ask that it. be printed
 at this point in the RECORD:
 [From the New. York Times, June 7, 19651
 CONGRESS AND VIETNAM
 Signs are growing of congressional interest
 in ending the leave-it-to-Lyndon era  in
 American foreign policy.
 There is Senator FULBRIGHT's new proposal
 to give the OAS a major voice in channeling
 American  military  assistance  to Latin
 America.  There is the provision in the pew
 foreign aid bill for a thoroughgoing con-
 gressional investigation and for terminating
 the aid program in its present form in 1967.
 There is the trip to Europe, at their own
 expense, of four House Republicans to in-
 vestigate the crisis in NATO.  And there are
 the recent criticisms of administration policy
 in Vietnam and the Dominican Republic
 by  Senator  ROBERT  F. KENNEDY,  plus  his
 current charge that the United States is
 neither meeting its aid responsibilities to the
 underdeveloped' countries  nor  identifying
 itself with the world revolution underway
 Factors that go beyond the President's
 limited experience in foreign affairs and
 Nowhere is this more vital than on Viet-
 nam, where grave constitutional questions
 are raised by the official acknowledgement
 of an increasing combat role for American
 troops.  During the 18 months of the John-
 son administration, the number of American
 troops in Vietnam has been tripled to about
 46,500;  a  further  buildup  to  more  than
 60,000 appears imminent.  American planes
 have entered into combat both in South and
 North Vietnam-in the latter case openly at-
 tacking a foreign country with no declara-
 tion of war.  American warships have bom-
 barded the North Vietnamese coast.  And
 there are indications that American ground
 troops-first employed as advisers in South
 Vietnam, then deployed to defend American
 installations and now directly engaged in
 patrolling action-will soon take on a full
 combat role as a tactical reserve aiding
 South Vietnamese units in trouble.
 Yet, at no point has there been significant
 congressional  discussion, much less direct
 authorization of what amounts to a decision
 to wage war.   That is why 28 Democratic
 Congressmen, on the initiative  of Repre-
 sentative ROSENTHAr, of Queens, now have
 wisely asked the chairman of the House
 Foreign Affairs Committee to hold public
 hearings on the administration's Vietnam
 .policy.
 American casualties. in Vietnam, while still
 relatively minor, already exceed those of the
 Spanish-American War.   The choices open
 to the President are exceedingly difficult
 ones; 'they should not be his alone, either
 as a matter of sound policy .or of constitu-
 tional obligation.  If he takes it upon him-
 self to make an American war out of the
 Vietnamese tragedy-without seeking con-
 gressional and national consent-he may
 open' the country to divisions even more
 dangerous than those that developed . out of
 the Korean conflict.

 Mr. ROGERS of Florida.  Mr: Speak-
 er, a new and rapidly expanding State
 university in my district, Florida At-

 participating university in Project Nep-
 tune-Atlantic. The Neptune project is a
 cooperative venture between the private-

 the scientific community in furtherance
 of the national oceanographic program
 of the United States.  Under this pro-
 gram a team of oceanographers will col-

 Engineering will equip a portable van
 with scientific instruments.  This van
 will then be transported to New York
 where it will be loaded upon the SS L~-
 port Champion and utilized during the
 ship's normal run to the Mediterranean.
 Upon return to New York the van will be
 unloaded and returned to the university
 where the data collected on the trip will
 be analyzed and appraised.
 I am extremely proud of the part
 Florida Atlantic will be playing in this
 cooperative venture. The field of ocean-
 ography is so vast and so full. of chal-
 lenges that utilization of our merchant
 fleet in cooperation with the scientific
 community will provide the opportunity
 to release our specialized oceanographic
 vessels for more sophisticated research
 tasks.  Florida Atlantic is well on the
 way to becoming one of the Nation's lead-
 ing institutions for ocean research and
 ocean engineering.
 Tribute to a Leader
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. ROBERT L. F. SIKES
 OF FLORIDA
 IN_ THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, June 1, 1965
 Mr. SIKES.  Mr. Speaker, my district
 is proud to acknowledge the presence of
 an outstanding American who has at-
 tained success, honor, and distinction,
 not only in one career, but in two.  He
 was a great military leader in World
 War II where he achieved the rank of
 vice admiral. Upon retirement from the
 Navy, he retired to Pensacola where he
 was promptly placed into service as
 mayor.  His work in that capacity has
 been outstanding in every respect. Now,
 he is insisting upon taking another well
 deserved retirement. He takes with him
 the very best wishes of every person who
 has been privileged to know him.
 I am glad to propose for reprinting in
 the RECORD a tribute to him from the
 Pensacola  News-Journal. of May 30,
 1965:        -
 TRIBUTE TO A LEADER
 Great leadership is much in demand these
 'days.
 And Adm.     Charles P.  Mason,  aviation
 pioneer, military commander, civic worker,
 and spirited mayor of our growing city, has
 been a great inspiration for high-quality
 leadership in Pensacola.
 We need more leaders like Mayor Mason.
 And we pay tribute to him upon his second
 retirement, from the official duties as mayor
 .of Pensacola. To us, he will always be Mayor
 Mason, a lifetime honor bestowed upon him
 :by the Florida Legislature following his pre-
 vious term in city -hall.
 The admiral epitomizes the brightest of
 leadership images, fulfilling a task which will
 long serve as a lofty goal of those who follow
 him, to city hall.
 Mayor Mason steps out of his high office
 at a time when Pensacola needs men of high
 caliber to inspire us and lead us through a
 period of municipal and community growth
 and prosperity.
 it is a time of reason, of positive think-
 . ing, of reaching out and grasping for more
 progress.  We welcome the new faces to the
 city council, men chosen by Pensacolians
 to carry out the policies and chart a proper
 course of high purpose through their talents
 as elected officials.  The next few weeks, dur-
 ing a period of change at city hall, should
 not be a time of indifference but a time of
 calm,  thoughtful  reflection  and  positive
 direction.
 We hope our elected officials will keep alive.
 the  leadership  demonstrated  so admirably
 by such men as Charles P. Mason.    He has
 always shown the highest character and in-
 tegrity.                                                                       And he stepped into the breach
 of municipal government to contribute great
 service after a long and honorable career
 as naval flier, innovator, and wartime com-
 mander.
 He has led many community endeavors,
 from all types of civic projects as well as
 service in Florida civil defense and the estab-
 llshment of the Pensacola Historical Museum
 in Old Christ Church at Seville Square.  His
 versatility is indicative of the type of leader
 so vitally needed in our city.
 'I live in Pensacola by choice, primarily
 because I like the people," Mayor Mason said
 in announcing his first retirement as coun-
 cilman-mayorin 1963.  A council resolution
 said: "He has brought to the office of mayor
 his attributes of dignity, distinction, zeal,
 firmness, and graciousness in such measure
 that he has given new meaning to the office
 which shall forever remain as a challenge to
 his successors and as an example to his fellow
 citizens * * * (his) leadership has brought
 about the greatest period of growth and the
 most outstanding era of expansion and pros-
 influence" and further commended him for
 "devotion,  loyalty,  unselfishness,  industry
 and fidelity that he has unceasingly given
 to each and every undertaking of both his
 public and private life.
 We sincerely hope that our newly chosen
 slate of municipal leaders will continue to
 draw inspiration from the long service of
 Charles P. Mason, a real leader whose retire-
 ment leaves big shoes to fill.

 MANSFIELD SEES HOPE, FOR PEACE IN NUCLEAR
 STANDOFF
 (NoTE.-Senate Majority Leader MANSFIELD
 spoke at the commencement exercises of St.
 Mary College in Xavier, Kans., on May 30.
 For one of the men in positions of real
 power in Washington, his speeches are few.
 In this one he gave his own definition of the
 issues between the Communist world and
 the Western World,  in simple terms, and
 revealed some of his own philosophy about
 our role in meeting the most important
 challenge before mankind today.  This is the
 text, with the omission of a few paragraphs
 of opening and closing remarks.)
 It is of some of these international changes
 of the past 15 years which I would like to
 speak today.  These are changes which be-
 gan as trickles just after your were born and
 and now coming into flood as you enter
 adulthood.
 An overriding change since the Korean
 war has been the emergence of a kind of
 stalemate between Russia and the United
 States in terms of destructive. nuclear ca-
 pacity.  Nuclear technology in both nations
 has now reached a_point at which no signifi-
 cant military advantage  is  likely to be
 gained merely by pushing the accumulation
 of more destructive power.  That is not to
 say that the Russians are not alert to possi-
 ble technological breakthroughs or that we
 have gone to sleep.  The search goes on
 here and it also goes on there.  But a deel-
 sive altering of the basic nuclear stalemate
 Is not in sight.
 The fact is that both, Russia and the
 United States are already in a position in
 which each can obliterate at least half the
 population of the other in a very short
 time.  That is a sobering reality for all those
 with a share of the responsibility for the
 many decisions which, In the end, may in-
 volve an ultimate decision as to whether or
 not these instruments are used.
 MONUMENT TO J.F.K.
 The very magnitude of the nuclear threat
 which hangs over the earth has had, oddly,
 a kind of constructive influence on world
 affairs.   It                  is  one  of  the  realities  which
 underlay the Russian withdrawal of missiles
 from Cuba a couple of years ago.                            And it
 was a major factor in the achievement of
 the nuclear test ban treaty.                          That treaty,
 in turn, was a precipitant in bringing about
 an improvement In the general relations-at
 least until recently-between the two princi-
 pal nuclear powers.  In that respect, the
 treaty was a most significant achievement
 in the drive for a more peaceful world.  It
 stands as an enduring and appropriate mon-
 ument to John  Fitzgerald Kennedy-who
 would have been 48 yesterday-' who refused,
 with great courage, to be deflected by politi-
 cal considerations, from his determination
 to achieve it.
 The nuclear stalemate between Russia and
 the United States, then, is, indeed, one of
 the most significant changes of the past
 decade and a half.  It has produced an
 international situation with which the prin-
 cipal nations have managed to live in rea-
 sonable stability for several years.  In its
 context, the prospect of a Soviet military
 invasion of Western Europe which, for exam-
 ple, was once regarded as acute, appears to
 have receded.  And by the same token, the
 military liberation of Eastern Europe which
 once  was loudly  trumpeted  is  no  longer
 pressed from any responsible source as the
 basis of a sound policy for the Nation.
 In short, the overall position of the two
 great nuclear powers in today's world ap-
 pears to have become, increasingly, one of
 live and let live.  This trend has emerged
 largely because the point has sunk home
 that the alternative is the opposite on such
 a scale as to drain either the triumph of
 freedom or the victory of communism of
 rational meaning.   But the picture of a
 gradual easement in Soviet-United States
 relations is not complete unless we also take
 into consideration the effect of recent devel-
 opments in Vietnam.  These developments
 have not helped the trend which was inau-
 gurated under President Eisenhower, pur-
 sued most effectively by President Kennedy,
 and vastly encouraged and continued by
 President Johnson,
 ,The changed situation in Russian-United
 States relations in turn has been paralleled
 by changes throughout the Soviet bloc.  It
 is obvious  that the  greater  stability in
 Russian-United States relations has not set
 well with China but It has generally been
 welcomed by such Eastern European nations
 as Poland, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Rumania,
 and Bulgaria.
 Communism did not spring full-blown in
 those Eastern European nations at the close
 of World War IT.  Communism was in fact.
 grafted by Soviet power onto several coun-
 tries with different traditions, even as Stalin
 shut down on them an iron lid of ideological
 uniformity.  The  clothes  of  Communist
 conformity, however, were uncomfortable In
 Eastern Europe and, beneath them, the in-
 dividual national traditions continued to stir.
 In. recent years, this force for diversity has
 begun to find fuller expression.
 The growing independence in eastern Eu-
 rope has been encouraged cautiously by re-
 cent policies of the United States.  This Was
 a cardinal principle of the foreign pol'p.
 President Kennedy, who recognized its valu
 with respect to Poland even when he was a
 Senator.  The conclusion of trade agree-
 ments and travel arrangements with eastern
 European countries which pose no threat to
 us, as, for example, with Poland and Yugo-
 slavia, has tended to increase their independ-
 ence from the Soviet Union. and provided
 some inducement for other satellite countries
 to follow in their footsteps-and that they
 have been, in fact, doing.
 EUROPEAN CHANGES
 In this atmosphere of reduced tension in
 Europe, a difficult and intricate problem re-
 mains as the central roadblock to further
 progress toward a stable peace in that region.
 That is the problem of a divided Germany.
 In East Germany,'the Soviet Union has con-
 tinued to maintain a harsh and rigid control
 over a people who dislike the Communist sys-
 tem intensely.  For our part, policy with re-
 spect to Germany is, apparently, based on an
 official assessment of immediate Soviet inten-
 tions in Europe which differs considerably
 from that of our allies in Western Europe.
 It appears to me that these nations-West
 Germany, Britain, France, Italy, and others-
 see the Soviet situation in quite a different
 perspective-at  least  insofar  as  this  per-
 spective is reflected in policies,                                                                                                                                             The Eu-
 ropeans, for example, carry on a trade with
 the Soviet,Union which over recent years has
 run in the billions.   What we have done in
 a most limited way in trade with Poland and
 Yugoslavia,  they  have  done  many,  many
 times over with all of Eastern Europe and, of
 course, with the Soviet Union itself. Travel
 within Europe-East and West-is now very
 extensive and the lines of communication
 by sea, rail, road, and air between the two
 parts of the Continent have expanded very
 markedly.  In short, the Europeans general-
 ly have been acting with respect to the Soviet
 bloc as though peace had arrived in Eu-
 rope.  We have not, in policy, shared that
 optimism.
 If there were a fusion of views as to pre-
 cisely what the situation is, it is conceivable
 that, with it, there might also come a parallel
 rebognition that proposals aimed at ending
 the armed confrontation in Germany and
 moving toward reunification are worth pur-
 suing most intensely.  A number of ideas
 have been advanced over the years which
 could serve as a beginning, but they have not
 as yet led to significant changes in policy.
 The shift in Europe over the past few
 years is not unique. It is paralleled, for
 example, by significant changes which in-
 volve the underdeveloped countries. The po-
 litical face of Africa has changed and over
 most of that continent control is now exer-
 cised by African leaders rather than by Euro-
 peans.  Many new nations have been added
 to the ranks of the intensely independent
 and underdeveloped states.  But from the
 point of view of the nuclear powers, almost
 all such states are, now, of less importance
 as strategic prizes, to be wooed for their value
 as bases in the event of a total war.  We our-
 selves have recognized this change to a con-
 siderable  degree.  We  have,  for  example,
 abandoned a number of advanced airbases
 in these areas in the light of the develop-
 ment of the intercontinental ballistic missile
 and  Polaris-carrying nuclear submarines.
 Similarly, the control of alien territory to in-
 sure access to strategic military raw ma-
 terials which was once an absolutely vital
 consideration for all great powers may no
 longer carry quite so much weight.
 RESISTING AGGRESSION
 This  change in attitudes involving the
 underdeveloped nations applies in southeast
 Asia.  President Johnson has said that there
 Is no need for a forward base in that part of
 the world.   Our fundamental power in the
 Pacific is air and sea power.  This power,
 supreme throughout the Pacific, is sufficient

 p'otect American security from any direct
 military threat from that part of the world
 for some years to come.
 We also have in Vietnam, as elsewhere in
 southeast Asia, a shared interest with all free
 nations In resisting aggression.  We can and
 will remain prepared to assist in stopping
 overt attempts to overrun peoples by force.
 But beyond this goal of preventing aggres-
 sion in order to promote peace and freedom
 under the rule of law in the world, our di-
 rect national interests in southeast Asia are
 not nearly as great, for example, as those
 which we have with respect to Latin Amer-
 ica.
 For these reasons, as well as a basic aver-
 sion to war itself, the President has made it
 clear that we are willing to enter into un-
 conditional discussions in an effort to find
 an honorable settlement in Vietnam and a
 more stable situation throughout southeast
 Asia.  But if there is ever to be an honorable
 settlement, there has to be a beginning.
 There has to be a confrontation across the
 tables of peace.  If such a meeting is to have
 any prospect of a successful outcome, there
 is also a parallel and simultaneous need for
 an interim cease-fire and standfeat-both
 north and south.  Unless the sounds of con-
 flict are, first, stilled on all sides, the words
 of peace will not be heard on any side.
 COMMON EFFORT NEEDED
 I am at a loss to understand how those
 elsewhere-in Peiping, for example-expect
 to be taken seriously in professing to hold
 paramount the Interests of the people of
 Vietnam and a restoration of peace when, at
 the same time, they insist upon interpreting
 the President's words as meaning something
 other  than  unconditional  discussion.  It
 would be in our own best interests no less
 than in the best interests of the underde-
 veloped countries of southeast Asia were the
 latter able to concgntrate on their own inner
 national needs and growth.  That was clearly
 the President's hope when he offered to join
 with the Soviet Union and other nations in a
 common effort for the development of south-
 east Asia.
 A common effort of this kind is clearly, too,
 the best way to help most of the underde-
 veloped nations, wherever they may be in the
 world, to remain free of outside domination
 and influence and to give indigenous institu-
 tions of freedom an opportunity to take-root.
 Indeed, in the long run, it may be just about
 the only way to help them.
 We are not likely to insure freedom within
 these nations by taking it upon ourselves
 either to overwhelm them with unilateral
 help or by turning our backs on their genuine
 needs for help.  The one is the road to an
 Isolated internationalism for this Nation.
 The other is the road to a national isolation
 for this Nation. And neither road is likely
 to lead to the. safeguarding of the basic in-
 terests of this Nation.  in short, the great
 need Is for a discrete and discerning coopera-
 tion with other nations in dealing with un-
 derdeveloped nations.
 SEARCH FOR PEACE            _
 This principle has relevance for the current
 crisis in the Dominican Republic Which, after
 decades of a cruel dictatorship, Is still a most
 underdeveloped  nation.    The  President
 faced a critical situation--an emergency-
 there some weeks  o
 humanitarian grounds and   mIo meet                             .
 met it well
 And he is acting now to bring fully into play,
 the concept of-cooperation with others in
 that situation.  As a member of, the Orga-
 nization of American States, our military and
 diplomatic resources in the Dominican Re-
 public are being' used more and more in sup-
 port, of the Organization.  For the problem
 in the Island is not one of unique responsi-
 bility for the United States. It is one which
 must engage primarily the Dominican people
 and their leaders and, to the extent that it is
 necessary, the entire Western Hemisphere.
 With the development of an inter-Ameri-
 can military force, the heavy initial commit-
 ment of American forces on the island has
 already been reduced.  And it is to be hoped,
 moreover, that this reduction will be rapidly
 accelerated if stability can be restored under
 the guidance of the OAS. I would hope, too,
 that the inter-American force which would
 remain could play two roles--that is, to sup-
 port the efforts of the OAS and also to help
 in the reconstruction of Santo Domingo
 which has been seriously damaged in the
 struggle.  It would also be desirable if other
 American states could develop a peace corps
 and send contingents to join the young men
 and women of this Nation who are already
 undertaking in  the  Dominican  Republic
 many works of useful and peaceful construc-
 tion.
 To Americans, even to college students like
 you, the affairs of nations outside our bor-
 ders may seem remote and unimportant at
 times, especially on a day like today.  But
 I need not remind you-on Memorial Day-
 that events whose origins lay thousands of
 miles from our shores have reached into this
 Nation in the past and called us to sacrifice.
 As Americans, as inhabitants of the only
 world we have, I ask you to exercise the in-
 creasing responsibility which will be yours
 in the years ahead to see that no stone lies
 unturned, and that no outdated myth or
 ancient hatred lies unexamined, and that no
 opportunity is neglected in the slow pains-
 taking search for a lasting peace.
 And I ask you, too, to give your prayers to
 the President of the United States,  His is
 the enormous burden in these matters.  His
 is the paramount responsibility.  For him,
 there is no rest from the incessant pressure
 of the problems of the Nation.    For him,
 there is a plethora of advice and criticism
 which is easily a  ugh extended.  But upon
 him, In the en     falls the weight of grave

 AID 7L5 SOUTH VIETNAM BY COUN-
 TRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED
 STATES
 Mr. DOMINICK.  Mr. President, the
 United States continues with the un-
 pleasant but necessary task of helping
 the people of southeast Asia to resist the
 aggressions of communism.  You and I
 and the rest of the American people read
 each day about the maneuvers of the
 South Vietnamese and our own troops;
 the areas being defended; and the grow-
 ing casualty toll.
 I have heard public expressions of
 doubt, even on the floor of the Senate,
 about the desirability of our action, ex-
 pressions which imply, at least, that we
 are responsible for this problem. What
 blindness.  Every action taken by this
 Nation has been geared to offset aggres-
 sion in one form or another started by
 the    Communists  in  each  instance.
 Whether we speak of Berlin, Cuba, Santo
 Domingo, Indonesia, South Vietnam, or
 the Congo, all the problems have been
 created by the clearly spoken and re-
 iterated words of the Communists that
 they intend to rule the world.
 Are wealone'in recognizing these prob-
 lems?  Are we so different in seeing
 problems in South Vietnam that other
 countries back away from supporting our
 position?  Exactly the opposite is true.
 Today, 38 nations are giving or have
 agreed to give aid in one form or another
 to the people of South Vietnam, who are
 resisting naked Communist aggression.
 To me, this is highly interesting.  I
 have compiled a list of the countries
 which are proceeding to give aid to South
 Vietnam at present, together with a
 statement of what aid is being provided-.
 at least, those things that are being done
 which are not under security classifica-
 tion.
 These countries-and I shall not read
 everything they are doing, but I wish to
 name the countries-include Australia,
 Nationalist China, Japan, South Korea,
 Laos, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philip-
 pines, Thailand, Greece, Turkey, Iran,
 Israel, India, Austria, Belgium, Canada,
 Denmark, France-even France has pro-
 vided some aid--Germany, Ireland, Italy,
 Luxembourg, Holland, Spain, Switzer-
 land, the United Kingdom, Argentina
 Brazil, Ecuador, and Guatemala.
 In addition, it ought to be noted that
 only 10 nations were assisting us in
 South Vietnam prior to July 16, 1964, less
 than'a year ago.  The other 28 nations
 have begun their assistance since that
 time.
 In addition to the countries I have
 named, several other Central American
 countries, including Costa Rica, Hon-
 duras,  Nicaragua,  and  El  Salvador,
 have been trying to muster a medical
 team to send to South Vietnam for as-
 sistance.
 It seems to me that such assistance is
 of extreme importance, because nowhere
 have I seen any kind of rundown In the
 news media or elsewhere which would in-
 dicate the degree of support which is be-
 ing given to the free South Vietnamese
 people in their efforts to resist Commu-
 nist aggression by North Vietnam and
 Red China.  Therefore, I am happy to
 present this information for the benefit
 of all Senators and for the country as a
 whole, inthe hope that more recognition
 may be given of the assistance which
 other countries have been and are giving
 to South Vietnam and to the United
 States in the interest of preserving the
 freedom of people, not only in southeast
 Asia, but in the rest of the world, as well,
 against Communist aggression.
 I ask unanimous consent that the
 statement I have prepared be printed at
 this point in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the state-
 ment was ordered to be printed In the

 TECHNOLOGICAL INTELLIGENCE
 Mr. TOWER.  Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that there be printed
 in the RECORD for the convenient refer-
 ence of other Senators a penetrating and
 important article by Claude Witze, senior
 editor of Air Force and Space Digest.
 The article appeared in the May edition
 of this professional journal.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 OUR ANSWER TO FUTURE THREATS: ACTION OR
 REACTION?
 (By Claude Witze)
 There is no denying that America, and
 Americans, have learned a lot from the cold
 war.  Most of the lessons were taken the hard
 way.  We have been amazed by many things,
 ranging from the Communists' speedy de-
 vvelopment                                                                                                                                   of  thermonuclear  weapons  to
 Sputnik and to the swamp war being waged
 against freedom in South Vietnam.
 It seems a bit incredible, for example, that
 the Wright brothers came out of Dayton,
 Ohio, more than 60 years ago and that U.S.
 airpower has dominated world aviation, yet
 the Russians were first into space. This was
 because we willed it so.  Sputnik could have
 been ours; we were warned that the Russians
 were moving into space, and we did less than
 we could have done.
 . This kind of technological conservatism
 has been with us for a long time. The Wright
 brothers contended with it.  In the years
 immediately after Kitty Hawk, the boys from
 the bicycle shop strove to interest their own
 Government in the airplane. The skepticism
 was almost overwhelming.  It was not until
 after the British, Germans, and the French
 displayed serious curiosity that the Signal
 Corps ordered the  first military aircraft.
 Octave Chanute speculated that a European
 country would have bought the rights before
 we got around to it, except for the possibility
 that the Wrights could be kept "dangling in
 the expectation that some of your competi-
 tors will discover the secret and they can get
 your invention cheaper."
 In this case, the assessment of a techno-
 logical capability was more important to the
 United States than the capability itself.  If
 the Wright brothers had said they knew how
 to build a controllable airplane but couldn't
 convince  anyone they could, there would
 have been no sale.  History would have been
 different, but the possibility of that having
 happened is remote because someone in Eu-
 rope would have believed them, even if their
 countrymen had refused to.
 The quality of judgment exercised in evalu-
 ating information is critical.  It was sad on
 the eve of Pearl Harbor, terrible during the
 events leading to the Korean war, faulty in
 its estimate of the Soviet nuclear timetable.
 In South Vietnam, where coups take place
 more frequently than a CIA agent gets his
 hair cut, somebody is consistenty wrong.
 Here is the place to introduce a disturbing
 axiom:
 "The most dangerous development at the
 decisionmaking level of any government is
 overcentralization of the assessment of tech-
 nological, military, and political intelligence."
