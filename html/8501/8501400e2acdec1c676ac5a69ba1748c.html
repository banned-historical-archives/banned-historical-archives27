 France: Photo Finish
 f   IThe French presidential hopefuls are coming
 down to the wire in a dead heat, Giscard and
 Mitterrand are both flailing about in search of
 new issues, endorsing everything from minimum
 wages to indemnification of czarist bonds in a
 last-ditch effort to win the crucial floating votes
 that will decide the election on May 19.)
 Some of the most recent polls show voters
 split 50-50. Rival polls have put Giscard mar-
 ginally ahead, but the race will obviously be a
 close one, Should the election be as close as
 predicted, the outcome may hang on the 2.6
 percent overseas vote, which will delay the ver-
 dict.                           in the event of
 a "photo finish"-one percent or less-ballots will
 be recounted. This procedure could cause a three-
 day delay in the publication of the official resultsl
 [the ideological views of the two candidates
 differ sharply, but the distinctions between their
 platforms have gradually become blurred as both
 Giscard and Mitterrand have sought to appeal to
 as broad a spectrum of voters as possible. Giscard
 has wooed the working class and suggested a
 minimum wage of $240 a month, while Mitter-
 rand has promised that he has no intention of
 increasing the taxes of middle-level executives or
 of fiddling with their private pension schemes.
 Both are for "change" and their slogans are al-
 most identical: Mitterrand-"A president for all
 the Fren h"; Giscard-"The president of all the
 French.
 "J
 trhe most distinctive features contained in
 the   common  program   Mitterrand has nego-
 tiated with the Communist and other leftist
 parties are the nationalization of eight or nine
 giant industrial firms and the state control of
 private banks and insurance companies. Mitter-
 rand has asserted that he would draw the line
 there, and that he does not favor wholesale na-
 tionalization.  By raising the specter of even
 limited nationalization, however, Mitterrand has
 driven many centrist political leaders, including
 Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber, and their fol-
 lowers reluctantly into Giscard's camp. I
 (The televised debate between the candidates
 on May 10 was generally conceded a draw, but
 during his concluding remarks Giscard struck a
 significant blow when he accused Mitterrand of
 being a man of the past-a man, by implication,
 who not only represents an outdated socialism,
 but who also refuses to grapple with the effects of
 his  "common  program" on  France's future.
 Earlier Giscard had characterized his own first
 round victory as the birth of a "great wave of
 youth and enthusiasm."i
 1)   rGiscard is considered by many Frenchmen
 to have a better grasp of the complexities of
 modern society-to have judged more accurately
 the pulse of contemporary France, which he sees,
 not as a society of classes, but as an industrialized
 "national collectivity." Giscard is gambling that
 the prevalent French mood is a desire to change
 the existing society,  not to create a new

 Portugal
 PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT
 C )
 A broadly based coali(icir? government that
 inclddes two communists was sworn in this week
 with the avowed aim of guiding Portugal into a
 democratic era after nearly 50 years of authori-
 tarian rule.
 It is a provisional government that will rule
 only until elections are held sometime before
 April  1975.  The  military junta, which seized
 power last month, will monitor the government's
 activities. Under an interim constitutional decree
 issued this week, the armed forces will be com-
 pletely independent from the government. The
 armed forces chief of staff General Costa Gomes
 will have equal status with the prime minister.
 The 15-member cabinet appears to have rep-
 resentatives from all portions of the political spec-
 trum, although the absence of political parties in
 Portugal for so many years makes it difficult to
 pinpoint political affiliations. The foreign, justice,
 and information ministries went to members of
 the Socialist  Party. Alvaro Cunhal, secretary-
 general of the Communist Party, was named min-
 ister without portfolio, and another Communist
 official was appointed minister of labor.
 The new prime minister is former bar asso-
 ciation      president  Adelino da Palma Carlos, a
 wealthy lawyer and professor who has not been
 aligned with any political party. His political phi-
 losophy is thought to be right of center.
 General Spinola, who assumed the office of
 President on May 15, remains the most powerful
 man in Portugal. In his inaugural address, he
 warned  against  excesses  and  bestowed  lavish
 praise on the Armed Forces Movement. He was
 especially  complimentary  to  the      "younger
 cadres" whose "nobility," he said, "rescued the
 country from national tragedy."
 In contrast to the blandishments Spinola lav-
 ished  on the younger  officers, the junta an-
 nounced yesterday that 42 senior officers had
 been placed on the reserve list, bringing to 66 the
 number of high-ranking officers who have been
 purged since the coup. Among those purged are
 several prominent conservatives who do not sup-
 port Spinola's notions of self-determination for
 the African territories.
 These members of the Portuguese provisional government
 and their offices are: (L, front to back) Alvaro Cunha],
 Communist, minister without portfolio; Mario Soares, So-
 cialist, foreign minister; Avelino Pacheco Goncalves, Com-
 munist, minister of labor. (Center) Raul Rego, Socialist,
 information minister. (R, front to back) Adelino da Palma
 Carlos, nonaligned, prime minister; Manuel Rocha, non-
 aligned, minister of public works; and Francisco Salgado
 Zenha, Socialist, minister of justice.

 In his address, Spinola repeated many of the
 promises for a more open society that he made
 immediately after the junta seized power. He also
 stressed that minorities "whether they be here or
 in Africa" should not interfere with the demo-
 cratic process. He did not identify the minorities,
 but in Africa it could apply both to the white
 settlers and the black insurgents. At home, he
 probably was referring to leftists who have moved
 to take over local government offices and por-
 tions of the business community..
 P  fhe new provisional government in Lisbon
 faces a wide array of problems in the African
 territories. The insurgent movements have either
 rejected outright Lisbon's offer of a cease-fire, or
 they have proposed conditions the Portuguese
 may find hard to meet. Some white settlers,
 meanwhile, are voicing concern over Lisbon's in-
 tentions in the territories, and there have been a
 few incidents between blacks and whites.
 Pn May 13, leaders of the insurgent move-
 ment in Portuguese Guinea announced that they
 were prepared to begin negotiations with Lisbon
 "with or without a cease-fire." The rebel offer,
 which gives both sides considerable leeway, in-
 cluded the condition that Lisbon recognize the
 "right of independence" for the "Republic of
 Guinea-Bissau," proclaimed by the insurgents last
 fall, as well a  for the peoples of Angola and
 Mozambique. I
 7   JThe junta termed the offer "constructive."
 The newly formed government in Lisbon will give
 it careful consideration, but may find it difficult
 to accept all the rebel conditions. Lisbon prefers
 to deal with the three territories separately, and is
 likely to make its response applicable only to
 Portuguese Guinea. So far, the Portuguese Gov-
 ernment has offered the insurgents an equal
 chance with newly emerging political organiza-
 tions to determine the future of the territories.
 Lisbon has recognized the territories' right of
 self-determination,  acknowledging  the  risk of
 eventual independence, but it hopes for a close
 federation with them, particularly with Angola
 and Mozambique
 '  [On the same day the Portuguese Guinea
 rebels made their offer, Angolan and Mozambique
 insurgent  leaders and  representatives of black
 African governments supporting them, meeting in
 Dar es Salaam, called for increased military activ-
 ity by the rebels. In Mozambique, the rebels have
 recently intensified military action in the central
 part of the territory, an area of heavy white
 settler concentration, following a brief lull after
 the coup last month in Lisbon...
 [Unrest is high in the area as a result of the
 insurgency and an economic decline. A visit last
 weekend by armed forces chief of staff General
 Costa Gomes was marred by demonstrations by
 angry whites protesting inadequate military pro-
 tection. On  May  12, an angry rock-throwing
 crowd of whites broke up a political rally in a
 black suburb of Beira. Blacks retaliated by ac-
 costing whites who later tried to pass through the
 suburb
 rMany Mozambicans believe Lisbon is ready
 to offer favored treatment to the insurgents. This
 belief has probably been reinforced by knowledge
 that Lisbon has commissioned  several former
 political  prisoners,  all  well-known  blacks,  in-
 cluding a brother of an insurgent leader, to pre-
 sent its case to the rebels. The ex-prisoners are
 expected to arrive in Dar es Salaam, where the
 rebels maintain headquarters, within a few days. 7
 ./    n Angola, the level of insurgency has been
 low for the past few years, and Lisbon is under no
 immediate  military  pressure  to accommodate
 rebel groups there. The Portuguese Government,
 however, is apparently worried that the insurgents
 are preparing for a military push in northern
 Angola and is augmenting its military forces there
 with  troops    from  other  parts  of  the  terri-
 tory.

 CAMBODIA: POLITICAL STIRRINGS
 l TSome familiar political problems upstaged
 t e military situation this week. Student and
 teacher activists in Phnom Penh, who tended to
 their academic pursuits for the past month, have
 resumed criticism of the government. Students
 decorated some schools in the capital with ban-
 ners and posters denouncing the government for
 its inability to reduce inflation and curb corrup-
 tion, and student leaders called for large anti-gov-
 ernment  demonstrations.  Some  teachers have
 gone back on strike to protest anew their inade-
 quate salaries, while others have been pushing for
 another national teachers' congress on May 17 to
 voice their lack of confidence in the government
 )O  Trying to keep the unrest within bounds,
 Prim  Minister Long Boret announced a few new
 measures aimed at easing some of the teachers'
 economic problems. Defense Minister Thappana
 Nginn, meanwhile, accused the Khmer Commu-
 nists of stirring up the students and teachers and
 stated that tighter security measures were being
 put into effect in Phnom Penh. Cambodian Army
 Chief General Fernandez, however, has indicated
 that government security forces in the capital will
 avoid confrontations with students and teachers
 in order to prevent major disorders from oc-
 curring.
 I C)  (Lon Nol has used the unsettled situation to
 force another "state of danger" declaration from
 the legislature, similar to the one that expired in
 early April. The new declaration, which is valid
 for six months, gives the government special
 powers enabling it to suspend such constitutional
 rights as freedom of assembly. The President
 presumably  intends to use the document,  if
 necessary, as a legal basis for any moves against
 antigovernment  elements  exploiting legitimate
 grievances/
 ON THE MILITARY FRONT
 11   Khmer  Communist forces well  north of
 Phnom Penh launched their anticipated attacks
 against the provincial capital of Kompong Thom.
 Sporadic Communist artillery fire caused little
 damage, however, and ground assaults against the
 city's outlying defenses were repulsed. The at-
 tacks did not prevent the airliftin  of additional
 reinforcements to Kompong Thom
 r t  fin the southwest, government holdings along
 the 90-mile stretch of Route 4 between Kompong
 Speu City and Ream have been reduced to two
 garrison positions. The army high command is
 building up its forces at Ream by pulling addi-
 tional units out of Kampot City. Thus far, there
 are no indications that the Communists are pre-
 paring for any major attacks against the naval and
 air  bases at  Ream or the nearby seaport at
 Kompong SomI
 J1 \Fighting was light on other battlefronts.
 overnment troops north of Phnom Penh at
 Lovek have expanded their perimeter against
 slowly diminishing resistance, while east of the
 capital Cambodian Army defenders at the provin-
 cial capital of Prey Veng have faced c  ly light
 shellings and ground probes.

 SEUKL I
 J    For years, Premier Chou En-lai has main-
 taindd a grueling pace while managing China's
 affairs, showing remarkable physical and mental
 stamina. Recently, however, he cut back on some
 aspects of his job. On May 9, he did not attend a
 state banquet given by visiting Senegalese Presi-
 dent Senghor. During the visit earlier this week of
 Pakistani Prime Minister Bhutto, Chou missed al-
 most all of the purely protocol functions and two
 substantive discussions as well. The official ex-
 planation, and Chou's own, is that he is slightly
 unwell because of his old age-he is 76. He has,
 nevertheless, kept a fairly active schedule amid a 17
 number of signs that his political health is as
 sound as ever!
 There has been much speculation outside of
 China that the 76 year old Premier is being forced
 by his political enemies into a state of semi-retire-
 ment. The Chinese have been at pains, however,
 to counter speculation about Chou's political
 demise. The two vice-premiers who stood in for
 Chou at banquets for the high-level visitors com-
 mented that they were acting on behalf of the
 Premier. One of the vice-premiers, Li Hsien-nien,
 is Chou's closest associate in the leadership; the
 other, Teng  Hsiao-ping, has seemed to work
 closely with Chou since the former's politica4
 rehabilitation a year ago7[Chinese media notes((
 repeatedly during the Bhutto visit that the Pakis-
 tani Prime Minister was in China at Chou's invita-,
 tion. Bhutto's complimentary references to the'
 Premier were duly reported by the official Chi-
 nese news agency, and the banquet for Bhutto
 was officially described as being given by Chou,
 even though he was not present. The joint com-
 munique issued  t the end of the visit mentioned
 Chou four times
 IChou's wife, who has been ailing for several
 years,  was  unusually  prominent  during  this
 period. Portions of her speech to a Vietnamese
 women's delegation were even published by the
 official news agency. A lesser government official
 who is close to Chou has appeared with unusual
 frequency-over the years his pattern of appear-
 ances has proven to be a reliable gauge of Chou's
 political status.)
 16  )Chou is clearly not incapacitated. Although
 he did not meet Bhutto at the airport, he accom-
 panied him later that day to a lengthy session
 with  Mao. Television coverage of that event
 showed Chou looking apparently fit. The follow-
 ing day, Chou conducted the initial talks with
 Bhutto that lasted nearly two hours, but he did
 not participate in the follow-up discussions?
 It  is  possible  that Chou  has been  pre-
 occupied of late with domestic business, espe-
 cially the ongoing anti-Confucius campaignl[A
 member of the inner circle around Mao and Chou
 hinted as much by suggesting that Chou missed
 the Senghor banquet because he had "more im-
 portant matters" to attend to.!
 The - anti-Confucius campaign has been re-
 cently characterized by increasing factional strife
 in the provinces that seems to reflect serious
 differences at the top over major policy and per-
 sonnel issues. Chou has apparently devoted con-
 siderable attention to these problems, and with
 some success. There has been a steady flow of
 official  instructions emphasizing the need for
 order during the campaign, and the propaganda in
 recent weeks has taken on a decidedly "Chouist"
 tons. [On May 7, for example, a local Peking
 newspaper lashed out at the extremists who in-
 cited  rmed conflict during the Cultural Revolu-

 their most prominent survivor  is Mao's wife,
 Chiang Ching, who is Chou's major antagonist in
 the current campaign. Chiang Ching did in fact
 urge young people to take up weapons during the
 Cultural Revolution.7

 share some of his duties in the foreign policy
 arena with his deputy premiers. No doubt he will
 continue to do so, especially with domestic poli-
 tics demanding so much of his time and energy.
 But a good indication that Chou remains firmly in
 the saddle is the fact that his lower public profile
 over the last week has not sparked a correspond-

 ITALY: DIVORCE BY A LANDSLIDE
 l r   rThe lopsided vote for divorce in the Italian
 referendum was a sharp rebuff to the dominant
 Christian Democratic Party and the Vatican. It
 was an unexpectedly large win for the broad
 pro-divorce grouping, which included the Chris-
 tian Democrats' three coalition partners and the
 Italian Communist Party. There was a 59.1-per-
 cent vote to retain the 3-year-old divorce law.]
 trhe outcome was a particular shock to
 Christian Democratic Party chief Amintore Fan-
 fani, who led the campaign to repeal the divorce
 law. Fanfani pushed his party into the battle,
 against the judgment of many other Christian
 Democratic  leaders-including  Prime  Minister
 Rumor-who preferred to cancel the referendum
 by working out a compromise with the pro-
 divorce groups. Fanfani, a major figure in the
 party for more than 25 years, has shown a re-
 markable ability to land on his feet after previous
 setbacks. He will have to do some furious rhetor-
 ical backpedaling this time, however, because he
 strongly implied during the campaign that  vote
 for divorce was a vote for the Communists./
 Fanfani and family
 Not enough votes
 Frhe Communists will get the major credit
 for the victory, although the pro-divorce front
 also included Socialists, Social Democrats, Repub-
 licans, and Liberals. Communist leader Enrico
 Berlinguer was, from the outset, the most active
 campaigner for retention of legalized divorce. The
 Socialists, fearful of being overshadowed by the
 Communists, also worked hard, but the other
 parties in favor of divorce did not mount a major
 public effort until the last week of the campaign.i
 u3 [Since the divorce issue cuts across party
 lines, the outcome does not necessarily mean that
 the Communist vote would increase in a general
 election. The Communists are jubilant, however,
 because the referendum tally suggests that they
 are in tune with the mainstream of Italian opin-
 ion, and that the Christian Democrats are not.
 This impression will help the Communists make
 more credible the claim that their party-Italy's
 second largest-is a respectable, legitimate organi-
 zation and therefore entitled to a role in the
 national government.1
 : 1; rThe Communists are building on this theme
 by taking a conciliatory line and stressing that it
 is now time to move on to the solution of "more
 important problems." Berlinguer will probably re-
 turn soon to his "historic compromise" proposal,
 which calls for a rapprochement between the
 /
 ommunists and Christian Democrats.
 All party leaders are now trying to figure out
 what the referendum outcome implies for the
 future of Italian politics. So far, most politicians
 have remained silent, but they are probably im-
 pressed by the failure of the anti-communist
 theme  and  the  sternest  admonitions  of  the
 Church to mobilize enough voters to repeal the
 divorce law. Many Italians are already interpreting
 the result as a vote for modern versus traditional
 values. Shortly after the results of the referendum
 became known, the headline in the country's
 most prestigious newspaper proclaimed: "Italy is
 Now a Modern Country." I

 Though stung by the defeat, the Christian
 Democrats will remain the major voice in any
 political "clarification" that may result from the
 referendum. Both the Christian Democrats and
 Socialists-on opposite sides of the divorce issue--

 ICELAND: ELECTION CAMPAIGN BEGINS
 a Although national elections are still almost
 six weeks away, statements by the contending
 political parties make it clear that Iceland's deteri-
 orating economic situation, the controversy over
 the Keflavik base, and the fishing limits question
 will be the principal issues in the campaign. A
 combination of public discontent with the gov-
 are linked to the cost-of-living index. Huge wage
 increases and a decline in earnings in the vital
 fishing  industry have also contributed to the
 gloomy outlook. The inflation rate may approach
 60 percent this year if the wage-price linkage
 remains
 3 I/   The new government must also renegotiate a
 defe se agreement under which the US has main-
 tained forces at the Keflavik air base. Last March,
 the Johannesson government tabled  proposals
 calling for the complete withdrawal of US troops
 from Keflavik by 1976. Although a more mod-
 erate coalition would  probably demand some
 modifications  of  the present arrangement, it
 would likely be more flexible than the outgoing
 coalition. The new government's attitude toward
 the base may be influenced by the outcome of a
 pro-base signature campaign in February, indi-
 catin  that a majority of Icelanders support the
 base.(

 `Prime Minister Johannesson decided to dis-
 solve parliament on May 9, after the Liberal Left
 Organization withdrew from the center-left coali-
 tion because of differences over the government's
 anti-inflation program. Freeing wages from ties to
 the cost-of-living  index and banning wage in-
 creases in excess of 20 percent were the two most
 controversial proposals in the program. Johannes-
 son will continue to head the government on an
 interim basis until after the elections on June 307
 ?  Iceland's grave economic situation will re-
 quire immediate attention when the new govern-
 ment takes office. Johannesson has stated that
 until that time he will decree provisional measures
 to avert an economic catastrophe. The cost of
 imports, especially oil, increased by about one
 third in the second half of 1973. The import price
 rise has been especially damaging because wages

 three members of the outgoing coalition-the Pro-
 gressive Party, the Liberal Left Organization, and
 the Communists-are split internally over the base
 issue. The Communists, all but a few of whom are
 vocal opponents of the base, may pick up some
 support from dissident members of the Progres-
 sive Party and the Liberal Left Organization]
 /If the opposition  coalition forms a gov-
 ernment after the elections, the chairman of the
 Independence Party, Gier Hallgrimsson, would
 probably become the new prime minister and
 Social Democratic chairman Gylfi Gislason would
 take over as foreign minister. In the meantime,
 Johannesson, anticipating a government led by
 the Independence Party, is trying to steer his
 Progressive Party away from the Communists and
 along more moderate lines so it will not be frozen
 out of the new government.

 ECONOMIC OUTLOOK FOR 1974
 The economic situation of the developed
 ,kcoun ries in the first half of 1974 will turn out
 ,).somewhat better than forecasters anticipated in
 January. Even so, depressed real growth, soaring
 inflation, and mounting current account deficits
 will dominate the economic outlook for Canada,
 Japan, and Western Europe
 LJ    fIhe revised projections indicate that real
 ross national product in the UK, and possibly in
 L?  apan, is declining in the first half of this year but
 is increasing moderately in Canada, France, West
 Germany, and Italy. Inflation rates generally ex-
 ceed 10 percent, and, except for West Germany
 and Canada, the current accounts  are in sub-
 stantial deficit-7
 '- r Most forecasts point to a recovery in the
 second half of the year, on the assumption that
 'estrictive economic policies will be relaxed or
 stimulative policies introduced in a number of
 countries. It is also anticipated that investment
 will be encouraged by shortages of capacity and
 the introduction of energy-conserving processesi
 '/    For the year as a whole, real growth of gross
 ational product in the developed countries will
 robably fall to half the rate of 1973. Japan's
 growth will be negligible in the first half. In-
 creased investment spending and business pressure
 for relief from restrictive policies should increase
 real growth to nearly 6 percent in the second half.
 The UK's gross national product will probably
 plummet by 8 percent in the first half because of
 the coal strike, weak consumer demand, and de-
 flationary budget and credit policies. The resump-
 tion of a normal work week and renewed con-
 sumer confidence should result in a spurt of 8-9
 percent in the second half,

 strong supporters of the Italian Communists,
 arguing that all West European labor federations

 ROMANIA-BULGARIA: LEADERS TALK
 Romanian party chief Ceausescu's talks in
 Bul  ria on May 11-12 with Todor Zhivkov, his
 Bulgarian counterpart, have sparked speculation
 about their purpose, mainly because they came
 shortly after Zhivkov's whirlwind visit to Moscow
 on May 8. The talks were cloaked in unusual
 secrecy,  but fragmentary information suggests
 that the two leaders focused on questions con-
 cerning the international communist movement
 rather   than  on  economic  issues  as  initially
 rumored. 1
 The entourages of both leaders consisted al-
 most exclusively of party officials responsible for
 inter-party and foreign relations. This and the size
 of the Bulgarian delegation suggests that the
 Soviets may have asked Zhivkov to try to over-
 pan-European  conference  of  communist  and
 workers'  artier, a necessary prelude to a world
 conclave
 i / rZhivkov played a similar role in 1966 when
 the Soviets, in preparation for the international
 communist conference in Moscow in 1969, called
 on him to try to induce the Romanians to attend
 a preparatory all-European conference held at
 Karlovy Vary, Czechoslovakia, early in 1967.
 Zhivkov failed, and the Romanians, along with
 the  Yu oslavs,  boycotted  the  Karlovy  Vary
 meeting.

 SYRIA-ISRAEL: THE GOLAN FRONT
 Military activity on the `y an front  n-
 creased this week after a quiet weekend. Israeli
 fighter-bombers  flew  strikes  against fedayeen
 positions inside Lebanon and on the slopes of
 Mount Hermon. They also struck once at Syrian
 positions south of the Israeli-held salient. Air ac-
 tivity over Lebanon was particularly heavy on
 Thursday morning when  Israeli planes struck
 several Palestinian refugee camps in retaliation for
 the terrorist incident at Maalot. Artillery, tank,
 and mortar exchanges occurred along the front
 throughout the week, but were noticeably lighter
 than in previous days.
 Syria has apparently removed its surface-to-
 air missile batteries from Lebanese territory near
 Mount Hermon. Officials of the Israeli Air Force
 told the US defense attache in Tel Aviv on May 9
 that the SA-6 units that were located in Lebanon
 had returned to Syria. The Syrian decision may
 have been made because Damascus expects a
 disengagement to be reached and because the
 missiles provided only minimal protection against
 Israeli aircraft flying over Lebanon toward targets
 in Syria. Israeli air strikes against these batteries

 3  (For the second time in barely a month,
 fedayeen terrorists struck at a major urban center
 in northern Israel. Three Arab terrorists and 24
 Israelis, mostly teenagers, died in the incident on
 May 15 in Maalot, a town about five miles from
 the Lebanese border. Most of the deaths came
 when Israeli troops stormed the school building in
 an effort to free 85 student hostages held there
 by three fedayeen. The government apparently
 decided in the end not to accede to the demands
 for the release of 18 terrorists and two spies held
 by Israel and for safe passage out of Israel for
 themselves.t
 ,q  The  terrorists  belonged  to  the  Popular
 Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine,
 a small, Marxist-oriented fedayeen group which
 heretofore has carried out a few relatively minor
 hit-and-run attacks. Although this group has been
 among those favoring a negotiated Middle East
 settlement,  the action  at Maalot was in part
 clearly an effort to set back progress toward
 negotiations
 6    {Israeli aircraft retaliated on May 16 with air
 strikes against numerous Palestinian camps in
 Lebanon. Although Jerusalem claimed its planes
 hit only military-related sites, some civilian in-
 stallations were also hit, causing civilian casual-
 ties.
 (The government, on edge and under severe
 domestic criticism for its inability to shield Israeli
 border settlements from terrorist attacks, placed
 its forces in northern Israel on alert after evidence
 was found that infiltrators from Lebanon crossed
 the border yesterday. This latest incident will
 increase domestic pressure on the government to
 adopt a hard stance against territorial concessions
 which would bring the Arab borders closer to
 Israeli population centers'
 RABIN GETS MORE TIME
 (1- 70-7
 '7 0 _ ! ~_1)
 Prime  (Minister-designate  Rabin  will  have
 unti May 24 to form a new Israeli government,
 under the extension granted him this week by
 President Katzir. Rabin claimed his preoccupation
 with the negotiations surrounding Secretary Kis-
 singer's effort to secure a Syrian-Israeli disengage-
 ment accord made it necessary for him to request
 the extra week. Under the law, he could get two
 more weeks if he wants them.
 Rabin may also have wanted more time to
 work out differences generated within the Labor
 Party by his plan to form a governing coalition
 with the Independent Liberal Party and the Citi-
 zens Rights Movement, two small liberal parties.
 Such a coalition would give the government only
 a one-vote majority in the 120-member Knesset,
 making it imperative that Rabin have the Labor
 Party united behind him.
 Prime Minister Meir, at a meeting of Labor
 Party  leaders on  May 10, came out strongly
 against the possibility of including Mrs. Shulamit
 Aloni's Citizens Rights Movement in the coali-
 tion.  Mrs.  Meir  claimed  it  would  further
 strengthen the doves in the government, but her
 personal differences with Mrs. Aloni may have
 weighed more heavily in the decision. This appar-
 ently was recognized by the rest of the Labor
 leaders who refused to accede to Mrs. Meir's
 wishes and voted to authorize Rabin to form a
 coalition with the two small liberal parties. Never-
 theless, other Labor members, particularly from
 the conservative Rafi faction, probably share Mrs.
 Meir's misgivings to some extent, and Rabin must
 take this into account.
 Perhaps partly because of such internal dif-
 ferences, the Labor Party is keeping open the
 option of forming a minority government without
 the Citizens Rights Movement, hoping to induce
 the National  Religious  Party-traditionally
 Labor's major coalition partner-to join later.
 Mrs. Meir, for one, favors this course. At this
 point, neither side is making much of an effort to
 break the impasse over the religious conversion
 issue, which is keeping the Religious Party out.
 Labor's central committee, after several postpone-
 ments, will presumably meet next week to ap-
 prove the outcome of Rabin's efforts

 ETHIOPIA: CONSERVATIVES WIN A ROUND
 fNew appointments and shifts of key military
 and civilian  personnel announced on May 14
 represent a victory for conservatives over the mili-
 tary moderates, their rivals for power and in-
 fluencel
 On the whole, the appointments on May 14
 app ar more an attempt by the conservatives to
 regain a measure of political control than an ef-
 fort to reverse the changes set in motion by the
 military revolt in February. Nonetheless, the mili-
 tary moderates, already angry over the nobility's
 intrigues, will regard the appointments as a direct
 challenge to their plans for ensuring social and
 political change in Ethiopia.?

 In the past, both Asrate Kassa, an important

 CYPRUS: GROWING TENSIONS
 12, Tensions have increased in Cyprus since the
 adjournment on April 2 of the intercommunal
 talks that have been going on for six years
 between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots. On the
 Greek Cypriot side, there have been renewed
 clashes between supporters of President Makarios
 and the followers of the late General George
 Grivas, who advocate the union of Cyprus and
 Greece (enosis). These pro-enosis forces enjoy the
 support  of elements  of  the  Greek-officered

 National Guard on the island. Relations between
 the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot com-
 munities have also worsened.
 Following General Grivas' death last Janu-
 ary, members of EOKA-B, his pro-enosis terrorist
 organization, became embroiled in a struggle over
 who would succeed him and what strategy to
 pursue. On April 22, a hard-line faction severely
 beat  and  injured  a  group  of Makarios sup-
 porters-the first instance of EOKA-B violence
 since the death  of Grivas. Reacting strongly,
 Makarios formally outlawed EOKA-B, set a dead-
 line of April 27 for the general amnesty extended
 to all wanted men in January, and announced his
 determination to wipe out those remnants of
 EOKA-B who remained in hiding. Only a few
 turned themselves in before the deadline, thereby
 setting the stage for more clashes
 ~Makarios has also been angered by a series of
 arms thefts from national guard stores and by
 anti-government  incidents  involving  pro-enosis
 elements of the national guard whom he suspects
 are in collusion with EOKA-B. The latest incident
 involved the theft of light weapons on May 7
 from a national guard armory and their probable
 transfer to EOKA-B. The theft will probably lead
 Makarios to try again to restrict the activities of
 the national guard and ultimately replace it with a
 full-fledged Greek Cypriot army formed around
 his personal military force. Makarios' determina-
 tion to break the back of the remnants of EOKA-
 B and his attempt to curb the national guard may
 well prompt a dispute with the Athens govern-
 ment, which views these two elements as indis-
 pensable tools for maintaining its influence in
 Cyprus
 IThe intercommunal talks were suspended by
 the Greek Cypriots when the Turkish Cypriot
 negotiator refused to disavow Turkish Prime Min-
 ister Ecevit's statement in late March calling for a
 "federal" system of government for Cypru
 ~ny system that would preclude majority
 Gree  Cypriot rule is anathema to Greek Cyp-
 riots. They view it as the first step toward parti-
 tion of the island. The Greek Cypriots charge that
 the Turkish Cypriot side is attempting to modify
 the terms of reference for the talks. According to
 the Greek Cypriots, the terms of reference pro-
 vided for a "unitary, independent, and sovereign"
 Cypriot state)
 The Turkish Cypriots claim that neither side
 agreed to such terms of reference. They have
 played down the Ecevit statement, however, in-
 terpreting it to mean a functional type of feder-
 alism rather than geographic separation of the
 two communities?'
 ~Osorio Tafall, the UN special representative
 irlCyprus, is attempting to get the talks resumed
 on the basis of a mutually agreed formula. The
 Makarios government rejected his first proposal as
 too vague, and he is now making a second effort.
 Although Makarios probably will permit the talks
 to resume eventually, he appears to be in no
 hurry. He hopes to extract concessions from the
 Turkish Cypriots, who are more anxious to re-
 open the talks. Their anxiety has been aroused by
 the growth of anti-Turkish sentiment within the
 Greek Cypriot community. This has been fueled
 by the Ecevit statement and by the Greece-
 Turkey  dispute  over  Aegean  oil  exploration
 rights, both of which are being exploited by the
 .,pro-enosis Greek officers of the national guard.
 .R~Turkish Cypriots became especially alarmed after
 an incident on May 9 in a mixed village when
 national   uardsmen  harassed Turkish Cypriot
 residents.'
 3   By stalling, Makarios is also protecting him-
 self                                                                 rom accusation by national guard officers
 and other pro-enosis elements that he is too ac-
 commodating with the Turkish Cypriots. Because
 tension between the two communities on the
 island is usually reflected in relations between
 their mainland sponsors,  Makarios' abstention
 from the talks could stir up trouble between
 Athens and Ankara. This would distract the
 Greek  rulers  and  strengthen  Makarios'  hand
 against their possible machinations, but it would
 also further inflame intercommunal tensions on
 the island.

 HONDURAS: STUDENT VIOLENCE
 [Amid  rumors of a possible coup against
 Chief of State Lopez, students last week plunged
 the capital city into two days of violence that
 nearly brought the army into the streets to con-
 trol them. Had the army done so, it might have
 gone on to take direct control of the government 4
 g 7 IThe demonstrations began  as a protest
 against Guatemala for its harsh treatment of
 workers  during  May  Day  observances.  The
 demonstrations degenerated into riots when one
 student was killed, allegedly by a policeman
 .The rioting continued into the night of May
 8 and resumed the next day. Property damage
 amounted to about $200,000, and 43 persons
 were injured, some seriously. Police detained 240
 persons and are still holding 200 of them)
 ? t the height of the disturbances, police
 began running low on tear gas, and students ap-
 peared to be gaining the upper hand. The army
 was placed on alert, and a number of unit com-
 manders wanted to assist the police. General
 Lopez, who is also chief of the armed forces,
 would not give the order, however. Had the riot-
 ing resumed on May 10, the army would probabl
 have intervened, with or without Lopez' permission.
 Lopez' failure to  reinforce the police is
 ano t er example of his indecisiveness, a quality,
 that is persuading many military officers and,
 prominent civilians that he should be replaced.
 Lopez has exercised practically no leadership, and
 in times of crisis he appears incapable of making
 decisions. Consequently, Honduras, already the
 least developed country in Central America, is
 falling farther behind its neighbors. I
 y' 7Rumors about a coup have been circulating
 since last fall, but have gained intensity in recent
 weeks. Latest indications are that Lopez himself
 has been persuaded that his resignation during or
 shortly after some disorder would be a face-saving
 wa  to retire.
 ,/ 7 Even though events move slowly in Hon-
 duras, some change seems in the offing. Lopez,
 who in the past has been largely responsible for
 the slow march, may no longer be the key person
 in the action. More dynamic leaders within the
 military argue that the military must exercise
 firmer control-and soon.

 BRAZIL: PRESS CENSORSHIP INCREASED
 f?  1Despite earlier hints that President Geisel
 was contemplating some degree of liberalization,
 the administration has instituted new, tougher
 controls on some press organs.]
 ep (The government has ordered the publishers
 of Veja, a weekly news magazine, to submit all
 textual material to Brasilia prior to publication.
 Veja  had  written  on  topics the government
 deemed overly controversial-such as the expira-
 tion of certain political restrictions on a number
 of once prominent public figures. The effects of
 the new censorship order could so hamper the
 magazine's roduction schedule as to put it out of
 -business.
 P.  Censorship has been renewed at Opiniao, a
 leftist weekly that had recently enjoyed relative
 freedom. In addition, full-scale censorship con-
 tinues at 0 Estado de Sao Paulo, the nation's
 most prestigious newspaper,
 25X1
 25X1
 ICardinal Arns of Sao Paulo, commenting on
 the new censorship order, noted that he has "lost
 all hope that the administration would end abuses
 in the areas of civil and human rights." The Cardi-
 nal, long a critic of the military regimes that have
 controlled Brazil for the past ten years, added
 that arbitrary arrests and torture are continuing.]
 Jrhe new censorship order comes at a time
 when  unrest-primarily  among  students  and
 workers --is growing, and it may be intended as a
 warning to all critics of the government. The
 President may also be responding to pressure
 from conservative members of the military hierar-
 chy who oppose an  liberalization.
