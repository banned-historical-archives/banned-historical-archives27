 PAID I - SOVIET ECONOMY
 CIA Director Admiral Stansfield Turner told the Joint
 Economic Committee of the Congress recently that the USSR
 will soon enter a period of reduced economic growth and that
 this will have important implications for the West.  Speaking
 in a closed hearing on June 23, Admiral Turner said his
 conclusion was based mainly on a sharp reduction in the
 growth of the.population of working age in the 1980s, coupled
 with anticipated Soviet bottlenecks in key com-nodities--
 especially crude oil.  As a result, Moscow will face new
 uncertainties and difficult policy options regarding energy
 use, imports from the hest, relations with Eastern Europe,
 and the size of its armed forces.
 According  to the CIA Director, Moscow's formula.for
 successful economic growth over the past 25 years--increasing
 inputs of labor and capital--is not likely to work in the
 1966s.   Already in 1976, despite a record grain crop, Soviet
 Gross National Product grew only 3.7 percent, continuing the
 downward trend of the past 15 years.  Admiral Turner noted
 first that the rate of growth in the labor force is already
 slowing because of the fall in the birth rate during the
 1960s and is expected to drop sharply in the 1980s.  Moreover,

 additions to the labor force are coming mostly from the
 ethnic minorities of Central Asia, who do not readily move
 to the northern industrial areas.
 Second, productivity gains have been slowing for years,
 and this trend is likely to continue.  One reason is that
 fuel and mineral reserves west of the Urals are being depleted
 while new resources in Siberia and Central Asia are costly
 to develop.  Other reasons include the increasing complexity
 of the economy, making efficient central control more and more
 difficult, and the increasing costs of technologically
 sophisticated products.
 Most important, according, to Admiral Turner, is a
 looming oil shortage.  CIA analysts have predicted that
 oil production will start to tall by the late 1970s or early
 1960s because the Soviets are not finding and developing
 new deposits fast enough to offset declining output from
 older fields.  Last year's production of 10.4 million bar-
 rels per day was close to the estimated maximum production
 of 11 to 12 million b/d.  By 1985 oil output is expected
 to fall to between 8 and 10 million b/d.  Moreover, Soviet
 production techniques, such as excessive water flooding,
 are geared to short-term gain rather than maximum life-time

 recovery.   most large new oil deposits and alternative
 energy sources, on which the Soviets are counting beyond
 the mid-198us, lie east of the Urals.  Development will
 take years and entail massive investment and high trans-
 portation costs.
 The projected fall in oil production will slow the
 growth of total energy output,- probably dramatically in
 1981-85, according to the CIA Director.  The decline in
 the growth of energy output will constrain economic growth
 unless Moscow finds ways to save massive amounts of energy
 or shifts from a net oil exporter to a net importer,
 Admiral Turner predicted.  Areas for large oil savings
 are more difficult to find in the USSR--where there are few
 automobiles and most are for commercial or industrial use.
 And under any but the most optimistic assumptions on energy
 production and savings, the Soviets will be unable both
 to maintain insorts of industrial goods from the West and
 to keep supplying Eastern Europe with the bulk of its oil
 and gas.
 Oil exports accounted for almost half of Soviet hard
 currency earnings last year, according to Admiral Turner.

 With no change in current energy policy, he said, oil imports
 in 1985 could be costing the Soviets $10 billion, making it
 difficult for them to afford any. manufactured goods from the
 West.
 The CIA chief cited a number of steps Moscow could
 take to try to boost hard currency earnings and reduce oil
 import costs--export promotion, gold sales, arms sales,
 barter deals-but noted that there are limits on all of
 these measures.  he said Moscow would be under great pres-
 sure to force Eastern Europe to share the burden of the oil
 shortages, but would have to weigh carefully the danger
 of worsening Eastern Europe's already difficult economic
 situation and of undermining its political stability.
 Lastly, Admiral Turner observed that, in addition
 to rising energy problems, agriculture will remain a
 major headache for Soviet leaders.  Farm production is
 well above the level of a decade ago, the result of mas-
 sive inputs of investment and good luck with weather.
 Even so, Turner noted, imports of farm products have
 accelerated in recent years.  Should the climate revert

 Approved For Release 2002/05/095: CIA-RDP90-01137R000100050004-0
 to the harsher and more normal conditions of the early
 1960s, the Soviets will have to continue large grain
 imports.
 'Various options in addition to those on energy
 are available to Moscow--retention of older workers,
 cuts in its armed forces, shifts from defense produc-
 tion, and limited economic reforms--to increase produc-
 tivity gains. CIA projections, however, indicate such
 measures would do little more than sustain economic
 growth (the growth of GNP) at around 4 percent a year
 through 1980 and would not prevent a decline to 3 to 3.5
 percent in the early and mid-1980s. Without strong action,
 however, especially on energy, the annual rate of economic
 growth could decline to around 3.5 percent in the near
 term and to 2 to 2.5 percent in the early 1980s.
 The economic uncertainties and policy choices facing
 Moscow in the next few years can have important effects on
 the West, according to the CIA Director.  Even assuming
 Moscow can increase its hard currency earnings and cut
 back on oil exports to Eastern Europe, the USSR will still
 experience a hard currency squeeze in the early and mid-
 1980s.  As its ability to import from the industrial West

 declines, Moscow may ask for long-term US credits to help
 develop its oil and gas resources. The squeeze could also
 trigger debate in Moscow over the future levels of military
 expenditures.
 Admiral Turner believes the Soviet consumer will fare
 poorly over the next five to 10 years compared with consumer
 gains of the past decade.  As a result, there is likely to
 be no Progress toward matching the living standards of the
 West, or even of Eastern Europe.
 PART II:  SOVIET DZFFIISE_ COSTS
 CIA estimates of Soviet resource allocation for defense
 were presented to the Joint Econcmic Committee by Dr. Sayre
 Stevens, CIA Deputy Director for Intelligence.  Because the
 Soviets go to some lengths to conceal their true expenditures
 for defense, Dr. Stevens said that CIA makes its own estimates.
 These are made in two forms:  in rubles in order to assess
 impact of defense on the Soviet economy, and in dollars in order
 to permit a meaningful comparison with our own defense effort.
 The Deputy Director told the Committee that the Agency's
 research and analysis over the past year have strengthened

 Approved For Release 2002/05/09 : CIA-RDP90-01137R000100050004-0
 7
 its confidence in its last ruble estimate, in which defense
 spending was projected as substantially higher than previously
 estimated.  That increase, Dr. Stevens pointed out, did
 not mean the Soviets had suddenly increased actual de-
 fense programs, but rather that.CIA had developed a much
 better information base and now knew that Soviet defense
 industries were considerably less-efficient than previously
 thought.  The revised estimate did not alter previous con-
 ceptions about the magnitude of Soviet defense activities or
 about Soviet military capabilities.
 Concerning CIA's latest estimate for 1976, Dr. Stevens
 said that Soviet military spending--defined to-include roughly
 the same range of activities encompassed in the US defense
 budget--totalled 52-57 billion rubles, as compared with 40 to
 45 billion in 1970.  Under a broader definition of activities,
 including airong others the entire space program--the way the
 -
 Soviets might see total defense costs--estimated Soviet
 outlays in 19'i6 would have been 57 to 62 billion rubles,
 as compared with 45 to 50 billion in 1970.
 Ruble estimates of defense spending as well as ruble
 estimates of Soviet economic performance are calculated in a

 Approved For Release 2002/05/09 8CIA-RDP90-01137R000100050004-0
 constant 1970 price base in order tolmeasure real rather than
 inflationary changes, according to Dr. Stevens.
 One way of measuring the economic impact is to estimate
 defense spending as a share of gross national product.
 Under the US definition of defense activities, the Soviet
 effort absorbed 11 to 12 percent of Soviet GNP in 1976; under
 the broader definition, the share was 12 to 13 percent.  Be-
 cause of comparable growth in both defense spending and
 GNP, the defense share has changed little since 1970, Dr.
 Stevens said.
 Measured another way, the CIA official reported, Soviet
 defense spending currently takes about one third of the out-
 put of the machine-building and metal-working sector of the
 economy--the sector that also produces investment goods--as
 well as about one fifth of metallurgy, one sixth of chemical
 and one sixth of energy output.  Even these measurements
 understate the impact of defense on the economy by failing
 to take account of qualitative factors--the high grade  .
 scientific, technical, and managerial talent and the high
 quality materials and equipment devoted to defense.

 According to CIA projections, Soviet defense spending
 will continue to increase into the 1980s at an annual rate
 of 4 to 5 percent.  These projections are based on the es-
 calating costs of new and more complex Soviet weapons systems
 that will eventually replace existing systems and on a continuing
 high level of defense research and development activity.
 Estimated dollar costs of Soviet defense spending are
 based on what it would cost in the US to develop and operate
 the Soviet military forces, Dr. Stevens said.  The data
 expressed in 1975 prices show that cumulative dollar costs of
 Soviet and US defense programs for the entire period 1966 to
 1976 were roughly comparable.  Estimated dollar costs of Soviet
 programs, however, have groom steadily at a rate of about 3
 percent annually over the period, whereas US real spending has
 declined since 1968 and since 1972 is lower than in 1966.
 As a result, estimated dollar costs of Soviet defense exceed
 US outlays by a widening margin after 1971.  In 1976, the margin
 is 40 percent; or, if military retirement programs are included,
 30 percent.
 Estimated dollar costs of Soviet defense programs in

 curement of weapons and spare parts and construction of
 facilities, the estimated cost is twice as much.  The dollar
 cost of operating Soviet forces is 15 percent greater than
 for US forces; if personnel alone are compared, it is 60
 percent greater, reflecting the larger Soviet manpower base.
 Dr. Stevens acknowledged that estimates of some Soviet items
 could contain a substantial margin of error and that
 confidence is highest in aggregate totals.
 In response to concern that the comparisons of US and
 Soviet defense programs made in dollars might be significantly
 different if made in rubles, CIA has also made some rough
 calculations of the ruble value of US defense activities.
 Although there are problems in this approach, such as an
 inadequate basis for estimating Soviet costs of producing
 some US military equipment or the Soviet inability to produce
 some high technology items, Dr. Stevens said that tentative
 calculations suggest no radical difference between dollar
 and ruble comparisons.  For 1976, the relative level of
 Soviet to US defense activities (excluding retirement pay)
 is about 1.4 to 1 measured in dollars and roughly 1.25 to 1
 measured in rubles.

 PART' III - THE CHINESE ECGNc 4Y
 For the Chinese economy, Deputy Director Stevens ob-
 served that 1976 was an extraordinarily disruptive year
 as a result of the deaths of both Mao Tse-tung and Chou
 En-lai, the arrest of and accusations against Mao's widow
 and others in the so-called "gang of four," and the massive
 earthquakes that caused enormous loss of life and industrial
 damage.
 CIA's estimates show no growth in China's gross national
 product in 1976, Dr. Stevens reported.  A slight gain in
 agricultural output was offset by a decline in industrial
 production.  The earthquakes in the Peking-Tientsin-Tang-shan
 area probably caused a loss of 20 to 30 percent of output in
 an area which normally provides a tenth of the national
 total.  The coal industry probably felt the greatest
 impact, but direct loss to the steel industry was probably
 around a million tons, and rail transport was significantly
 disrupted and strained.
 Although crude oil output increased by 13 percent in
 1976, this was the second year in which the rate of growth

 Approved For Release 2002/05/09 : RA-RDP90-01137R000100050004-0
 slowed after averaging some 20 percent for a decade.  As for
 agriculture, grain output probably remained at 1975 levels--
 280 to 285 tons--and cotton production was down.  China held
 down its grain imports for most of the year, but accelerated
 purchases abroad after November; grain imports this year
 will be close to 7 million tons.
 China's foreign trade in 1976 declined by about 10
 percent to 512.9 billion.  Imports were down almost 20
 percent, reflecting the cutbacks in grain purchases and
 completed deliveries on contracts for whole plants.  Although
 oil sales fell, exports held roughly at 1975 levels, and
 China's hard currency trade balance moved into surplus,
 easing pressure on the balance of payments.  Trade with Japan,
 China's major partner, was off 20 percent.   Trade with the
 US dropped nearly 30 percent, and for the first time, the
 balance favored China.
 Economic prospects this year are mixed.  Chinese
 officials see 1977 as a year of recovery and readjustment and
 are emphasizing month-to-month industrial and transport gains.
 Dry weather reduced the winter grain crop by 10 percent or more,
 but this could be made up by a good fall harvest.  Only moderate
 growth is expected in foreign trade.

 The new leadership, under. Hua Kuo-feng, has given
 economic issues high priority, according to CIA's Deputy
 Director for Intelligence.  It has confirmed Chou En-lai's
 earlier announced long-term economic modernization program
 as its basic blueprint.  Agriculture will get top priority,
 but more resources will also go to raising the level of
 technology in industry.  This, Dr. Stevens said, will re-
 quire heavy investment and imports of equipment, along
 with management reforms and worker incentives to encourage
 efficiency.  The new leaders are aware that this means
 modifying some of the Cultural Revolution's reforms,
 which were hostile to rapid economic progress, and they will
 give greater stress to higher academic standards and scien-
 tific and technological competence.
 China's leaders will also look closely at the pace
 of military modernization plans, but on balance will prob-
 ably prefer a period of military belt-tightening until
 problems in industry are solved, Dr. Stevens said.  He\also
 pointed to two major obstacles in the path of China's Fifth
 Five Year Plan:  the difficulty of asserting central control
 over, resource allocation in the provinces, where some local

 officials have been violating state plans, and the need for
 some action to curb labor unrest, stemming from the lack
 of a significant wage increase over the past decade.
 PART IV:   THE COSTS OF CHINESE DEFENSE PRCGRAMS
 Admiral Turner told the Joint Economic Committee that
 China's defense spending preempts a larger portion of that
 country's advanced industrial sector than is the case in
 the US.  Defense costs probably are in the neighborhood
 of 8 to 10 percent of gross national product.  Noting
 that China still relies for the most part on copies of
 Soviet weapons developed in the 1950s, the CIA Director
 said estimated total Chinese military expenditures grew
 very rapidly in the late 1960s to a peak in 1971, then
 fell substantially in 1972 and have remained roughly at
 the 1569 level ever since.  He suggested that the period
 of increase reflected increased Sino-Soviet tensions and
 the prominence of the military following the Cultural Re-
 volution.  The lower level of spending since 1971 is prob-
 ably due to decreased fear of war with the Soviets,
 to competing economic priorities, and to difficulty in
 developing new advanced weapons systems, the Admiral suggested,
 and does not involve a reduction in total Chinese forces.

 EXCERPTS FROM TESTIMONY
 SOVIET OIL PROSPECTS'
 Admiral Turner.   In 1976,  the Soviets were the largest
 oil producer in the world in millions of barrels of oil per
 day, slightly more than the Saudi Arabians.
 Senator Hatch.   I don't think a lot of people realize
 By 1985, you expect them to be down to about 8 million
 barrels of oil a day?
 Admiral Turner.   8 million to 10 million by 1985,  and
 I will detail why I think that is going to have some severe
 impact on them,  even though it is nonetheless a large amount
 of oil.
 Senator Hatch.   Are they getting most of their oil east
 of the Urals?
 Admiral Turner.   They are getting most of their oil west
 of the Urals.   They are still tapping those fields,  and also
 a very giant field east of the Urals called Samotlor in
 Western Siberia.                                       _
 Senator Hatch.   Thank you.
 Admiral Turner.   They are still tapping the Urals-Volga
 area but it is running down,  and they are having to move
 progressively further east..
 The giant Samotlor field we think will peak in about a
 year or two,  largely because of the use of water flooding.
 They will have to go to either off-shore areas in the north
 or further out into Siberia, or hope to find     extensive

 new fields in the Samotlor region.  But even in the Samotlor
 area, they are in an inhospitable climate, and transportation
 problems are going to grow as they move north and east.
 Senator Hatch.    How much of this oil do they use per
 Admiral Turner.   They exported nearly 3 million barrels
 a'day in 1976.
 .Senator Hatch.    Do they utilize the rest or do they
 conserve and save it?
 Mr.  Diamond.   No.   They are utilizing everything else.
 Admiral Turner.   An interesting aspect of this that is
 as they use more and more water flooding, they get more and
 more water out per gallon of oil.   They are very dependent
 .upon high-speed,  high-capacity submersible pumps, which at
 this time they obtain only from the United States.
 Now   in the mid-1980s,  they will surely look at ways
 to find alternative energy sources:   coal, water power,  gas,
 and so on.  But again, most of these resources lie east of
 the Urals and it is going to take heavy capital investment
 and high transportation costs to exploit those.
 Senator Proxmire.   What you said is that all of this
 oil is being used by the communist nations, by the Soviet
 Union and the Communist Bloc nations.
 Admiral Turner.   No.   All but about 1.7 billion barrels
 a day.

 Senator Proxmire.  You said that they export about 3
 million barrels a day in 1976, of which about 1 million went
 to communist countries.   Where does the rest of it go?
 Mr. Diamond.  About 300,000 barrels a day goes to soft
 currency noncommunist countries,  and the balance of 1.2-1.3
 million barrels a day goes to the hard currency western
 countries.
 Senator Proxmire.   So,  that would mean,  if they are
 going to have the same amount of oil go to Communist Bloc
 countries, they would simply be unable to have the exchange
 they would need to buy from the West.
 They would not be able to meet their growth with
 additional oil,  the growth which you projected they would
 have.  In other words, you cannot say that they could get
 along with the amount of oil that they have now if that is
 their only energy source because they are growing,  as you
 said.  The other communist countries are also growing,  so
 they would need more to take care of the needs of Russia and
 the needs of her satellite countries,  and they won't have that
 additional means.'
 Admiral Turner.   That is correct.   We have projected in
 our energy study that there will be about 3.5 to 4 percent
 annual increase in demand in the Soviet Union,  and that, plus
 continuing to supply the Eastern Europeans, who expect not
 1.3 million but 1.6 million barrels a day by 1980, is going

 1s
 to tax them, let alone their being able to sell this other
 million barrels.a day, which currently brings them about
 $4.5 billion of foreign exchange every year.
 So, what I am getting to is that they are going to be
 pressed either to meet their own domestic requirements for a
 growing economy,  or to supply the Eastern Europeans as pro-
 jected, or to get the hard currency exchange to buy technology
 and other goods from the West.
 They have a.crunch in one of those three areas.  We
 don't know now to predict which way they will respond to
 those crunches,  but we think each one has a very interesting
 and significant aspect,  not only from the Soviet point of
 view,  but from ours and that of the entire Western World.

 SOVIET DEFENSE COSTS
 Dr. Stevens.   As you will recall, the ruble estimate we
 presented last year was substantially higher than our previous
 estimates.   The reasons for this change and its significance
 have been widely misunderstood.   We raised our estimate because
 we discovered that in the past we had underestimated the prices
 of Soviet defense goods.   This was due primarily to lack of
 understanding of the price. inflation that occurred in the So-
 viet defense industries in the 1960's, and a change in pricing
 policies which occurred in 1967, which led to the removal of
 what in the past had effectively been a subsidy on defense
 purchases.
 The increase in our ruble estimates did not represent
 a change in our estimate of Soviet defense activities or
 Soviet military capabilities.   It was really based.upon these
 price discrepancies that we discovered.
 Senator Proxmire.   I hesitate to interrupt, but I think
 this is so important.
 Are you saying that your estimate did not indicate a
 step-up in Soviet investment in resources in defense, but simply
 a reassessment of the prices, of the inflationary effect?

 Approved For Release 2002/05/09 :IA-RDP90-01137R000100050004-0
 Dr. Stevens.  The dramatic increase in the ruble costs
 of the Soviet program, as we estimated it, was due primarily
 to this change in pricing.
 Senator Proaanire.  So, it did not mean as much of an
 increase in resource allocation to defense as it seems?
 Mr.  Diamond. That's right.
 Admiral Turner.  The percentage of their Gross National
 Product going to defense increased in our estimate not because
 their defense programs are larger than we thought, but because
 the efficiency of the defense sector of their industry is much
 less than we had believed.
 Senator Proxmire.  I see.
 Dr.  Stevens.   There was some growth in the hardware
 estimate, but it was small as compared to the change in the
 ruble estimate.
 This change did carry with it some important intelligence
 judgments, and these, of course,  are reflected in this pricing
 change that we have identified.   The first,  as Admiral Turner
 has pointed out,  is that the Soviets are far less efficient at
 producing defense goods than we had previously estimated them
 to be.   Of course, it is clear that the impact of the defense
 program on the economy is greater than we had previously esti-
 mated it to be.                           All of this emphasizes'the preparedness of
 the Soviet leadership to accept these burdens and it reflects
 their deep commitment to defense programs.

 The work that we have done in the past year in making
 that change-has strengthened our confidence in the revisions
 that we made.  This year we find no big changes in either
 the overall magnitude of their program, as we see it in ruble
 terms, or in the trends that it is taking.

 CHINESE DEFENSE CAPABILITIES
 Senator Proxmire.   That concluding remark that.you
 made on the Chinese military suggests to me that it is a
 very, very limited kind of threat.  After all, their Gross
 National Product is about 10 percent of ours,  and if they
 are spending 8 percent of their Gross National Product
 in defense, it means a very small military force, at least
 in terms of modern strike force, as compared to ours, or
 to that of the Soviet Union.
 Admiral Turner.   Yes, sir.  They have a very limited
 nuclear intercontinental strike capability.
 As far as ground warfare is concerned, our only real
 potential point of contact at this stage would be Korea.
 I think that they do have some potential there with a
 repeat of the massive human attack.

 SOVIET TECHNOLOGY LAG
 Senator Proxmire.   One of the sections of your excellent
 testimony which you had to skip. over in the interest of time
 concerned Soviet technology, their technology as compared to
 ours.
 One of the most startling revelations that we had last
 year when Director Bush came up to testify before us was his
 argument that Soviet military technology was behind ours.
 He put it this way.   He said that there was no significant
 area where they were ahead of us and many significant areas
 where they were behind us.
 In the two pages you have which deal with Soviet and
 US technology comparisons, you indicate some areas where
 they trail us,  such as electronics,  computers,  design and
 manufacturing technology incorporated into the Soviet air-
 craft and missiles.   Is the picture still the same as far
 as technology is concerned,  that we are ahead of the Soviet
 Union in important respects and that they are not ahead
 of us in any?   Is that a fair statement?
 Admiral Turner. I would be a little loath to make a
 categorical statement that they are not ahead of us in
 any.   They are certainly ahead of us in some areas of
 application.
 Senator Proxmire.   Such as?
 Admiral Turner.   In some areas of command, control
 and communications of military forces I would say they are

 ahead of us in application more than in technology; that is,
 they put more resources into that area.
 Senator Proxmire.   Can you give us an overall assessment?
 Admiral Turner.   An overall assessment would be that we
 are well ahead of them in military technology.   With brute
 force techniques, however, they do achieve about the same
 end result in many areas that we do with much more sophisticated
 techniques.   For example, they will put multiple computers in
 a system, each of much less sophistication than the one we
 put in ours.
 Senator Proxmire.   It shows a higher cost, but not
 necessarily a higher effectiveness, right?

 SOVIET DEFENSE
 Senator Proxmire.   Are you saying that the USSR defense
 spending exceeds ours in 1976 on a dollar basis by 30 to 40
 percent and if so,  I just wonder what that means?  .What you
 are saying, asI understand it, is for us to reproduce the
 Soviet defense establishment, it would cost-30 to 40 percent
 more than we spend on. our own defense.
 Is  that right?
 Admiral Turner.   Yes,  sir.
 Senator Proxmire.   However, much of that Soviet defense
 establishment would be irrelevant for our needs.   They have a
 large number of troops on the Chinese border, for example,
 right?
 Admiral Turner.   That's correct.
 Senator Proxmire.   They  have a problem of suppressing
 dissent in the satellite countries, so they quarter substantial
 troops in that area.
 Admiral Turner  (nods affirmatively.)
 Senator Proxmire.   Does it.allow for their lesser effi-
 ciency, their lesser technological development than ours, or
 not?
 Mr. Burton.   Sir, actually it is.US technology and produc
 tion that enter into these estimates, so it is what it would
 cost us to reproduce the Soviet design.

 Senator Proxmire.   Then there is one other element here.
 Perhaps I am wrong, but I have heard and I get the impression
 that the Soviet Union has very much more of a concern with
 defense, defense against air attack, the civil defense which
 you mentioned, that they are defense-minded or defensive-minded,
 as compared with offensive-minded, much more than are we and
 other countries.   Would that not account for some of the dif-
 ference?
 What I am trying to say is in comparing the Soviet Union
 with us, the relative force, effectiveness, and efficiency of
 the Soviet Union, we don't have the concern, for example, with
 a bomber attack that they seem to have.   I understand that they
 have the most heavily defended air space in the world.   Of
 course, that is enormously costly-and would account for part
 of their immense expenditure,. would it not?
 Admiral Turner. Yes sir.   The Soviets have deployed a much
 more ambitious air defense system than the US.
 I think you can look at the history of the Soviet armed-
 forces since world War II and in all categories they began with
 a quite defensive orientation.     I, of course, am most familiar
 with the naval sphere, and I would say that the origin of their
 navy was to protect against incursions from the sea towards
 their homeland.
 I think that in all areas in the last decade we see this
 merging into a much more offensive potential.   Whether that

 is their intent or not, I don't know.  But it certainly is not
 a defensive move to build up their tank inventory and their
 artillery on the western front of Europe as much as they have.
 Similarly, with their air force, they are going largely from
 fighter interceptor defensive aircraft to multipurpose attack
 and fighter aircraft.  Similarly with their navy, they are
 going from short-range capability to defend their coastal
 waters to a worldwide demonstrable capability,  including even
 small aircraft carriers.

 SOVIET OIL PRODUCTION
 Senator Proxmire.   You talked about the Soviet oil
 production and the effect that that is going to have on the
 Soviet economy, perhaps even on the Soviet military as time
 goes on.  You do concede uncertainty in some of your facts,
 including the amount of proved reserves, estimated by you
 at 30 to 35 billion barrels.
 In view of our own uncertainty about U.S. reserves, what
 is the margin of error in your estimate?  Could it be off
 by a factor of two or more, and if so, isn't it possible
 that the rest of the analysis is flawed?
 Admiral Turner.   I hesitate to say how much the
 estimate of reserves could be off without asking anybody
 else if he wants to guess about that.
 Mr.  Diamond.   Senator,  that is true, but you have to
 remember the definition of what we mean by "reserves."
 These are not what is in the ground.  These are recoverable
 reserves and what we consider to be at a reasonable economic
 cost.
 Senator Proxmire.   So do you agree that they could be
 twice as high as is estimated?
 Mr.  Diamond.   That is true.   It could be tremendous.
 For example, in this country we claim 30 or 35 billion
 barrels of recoverable oil but total reserves may exceed
 100 billion barrels.  The experts believe that with
 current technology only about one-third of these reserves
 are recoverable.

 Admiral Turner.  Even if they have twice as many re-
 coverable reserves as we think, in the next decade they
 cannot turn that into oil on the surface of the earth.
 Thus we do not think that invalidates the analysis which
 we have been presenting to you today, sir, because we are
 saying that in the next decade, the pressures which we
 tried to demonstrate this morning are going to exist.
 Senator Proxmire.   Are you saying that you are sure
 that they will not be able to produce, say, 12 million
 barrels a day in 1985?
 Admiral Turner.  Yes, sir.  That is our prediction,
 that they cannot even sustain the 10 million that they are
 doing today.
 Senator Proxmire.   But they have the reserves in the
 ground, so why not?
 Admiral Turner.  Because if they have not made suf-
 ficient progress towards developing those reserves, they
 cannot get it out by 1985, particularly in the inhospitable
 and remote areas in which they have to work.

 Senator Hatch.  Admiral, as I see it, at your highest
 estimate they have 12 million barrels a day.  Now we have
 presently a need in the United States for-about 18 million,
 considering no gain or no particular growth.
 They have a lesser industrialized economy than we do.
 They have what, 40,000 manufacturing facilities in Russia
 as compared with 295,000 in this country.   I don't see how
 they can use 10 to 12 million barrels a day.  I am wondering
 if they are storing that.
 Admiral Turner.  In 1976 they exported about 3.. million
 b/d.   Half went to other Communist countries; half to other
 areas. That means that they used about 7-1/2 million
 barrels a day, which is little less than half of ours.
 Senator Hatch.   I see.   That would correspond with the
 differences in the economies.
 You suspect that for them to have any type of growth
 at all they have to keep energy production going.
 Admiral Turner.   Yes,  sir.   That is the record;  their
 economic growth and their energy use have been in parallel

 SOVIET PARTICLE BEAM WEAPON
 Senator Hatch.   I have one other question.   Since coming
 to the Senate, I have had occasion to talk to some of our
 military people who are concerned that the Soviets may be
 developing special high-technology weapons that your report
 indicates they have not-developed, such as the particle beam
 weapon, various sensor devices, various forms of monitoring
 technology, et cetera.    Is  there any reason for that disparity?
 Some of these people seem to talk very intelligently about it
 and I have heard both sides.   Some decry everything that others
 cite.
 Admiral Turner.  We have analyzed the particle beam weapon
 in particular in some detail.   It is our belief that the com-
 ponent technologies that would be required to build that sort
 of capability are not advanced enough in the Soviet Union to
 give them the prospect of being anywhere close to developing
 such a weapon.  Most of the evidence adduced to the contrary
 is based on the assumption that a particular facility in the
 Soviet Union is dedicated to this purpose, and additional
 assumptions about their state of technology.  We think all of
 these assumptions are questionable.  Further, we don't see
 signs of those efforts required for pulling this together.
 Senator Hatch.  Are they working on particle beam weapon
 or something close to it?

 I don't have positive evidence that they are not.
 Senator Hatch.   We really do. not know,  then.
 Admiral Turner.  We really do not know.
 Senator Hatch.   But you do question seriously whether or
 not they have reached that form of technology at a high state
 of art?
 Admiral Turner.  We don't know that they are doing it,
 but we have fair confidence that they don't have the required
 technologies at a sufficiently advanced stage yet.

 .SOVIET--CHINESE RELATIONS
 Senator Roth.  There is one question that I have.
 As I understand your testimony in the case of China,
 they are really placing defense as a last priority, they
 place agriculture and industry ahead of their defense
 and military needs; whereas in the case of the USSR it is
 pretty much the opposite in terms of their top priority.
 The Soviets are placing their consumer needs way down on
 the list.
 Now if that is accurate, it would appear that the.
 imbalance,  if we can call it that, between the USSR and
 China is going to grow.   I have heard it said that some
 people think for that reason the military in China may
 desire some kind of accommodation with the USSR.
 Is there any evidence or any reason that you can see
 that there may be an effort for rapprochement or accom-
 modation between those two countries?
 Admiral Turner.   I see no evidence of any current
 moves in that direction or inclination to move in that
 direction.

 SOVIET OIL PROSPECTS
 Senator Roth.   The Soviet Union, according to your
 prediction, faces very serious economic problems.   I suspect
 that one of the problems we face on the Hill is to what extent,
 if at all, should we provide. economic assistance in one form
 or another.   One example that we have worked with in the past
 is to help them develop their natural oil and gas, particularly
 in Siberia.   If we, say, together with the Japanese join in
 helping that development, would that substantially change the
 energy picture as far as the U.S.S.R. is concerned?
 Admiral Turner.   Well, the word "substantial" is a problem
 for me.   It certainly is apparent that the Soviets today need
 help to hold their own, let alone to proceed, and that if they
 are going to develop new fields in Siberia, they are going to
 need outside financing as well as outside infusions of technology.
 So, while we do not believe that kind of assistance will
 appreciably change the predictions I have given you between
 now and.the mid-1980s, it certainly could be an important factor
 in whether they begin to come back up this downward slope that
 we showed you after the mid-1980s.   That kind of help is not
 likely to start producing oil for probably another decade.
 Senator Roth.   Do you have any predictions as to what
 recovery could be under a large scale program, say of 20 or 25
 years?  Do you have any prediction on-the number of barrels a
 day?

 Admiral Turner.   I don't think so, but there is no
 doubt that there is lots of oil out there,  right,  Doug?
 Mr.  Diamond,  Yes,  sir.
 There are no predictions.   One of our consultants
 feels that unless massive infusions of investment and
 technology are poured in, not-only from the U.S. but also
 from Western Europe, production may, not turn up in the
 last half of the 1980s or early 1990s:
 The required investment effort boggles the mind.  For
 example, in this 1976-80 five year plan, they are putting
 in 20 million tons of pipe or 24,000 miles of oil and gas
 pipeline,  just in this five year plan.   The Alaska pipeline
 is only 800 miles long.   To accomplish this goal,  the
 Soviets would have to lay an Alaskan pipeline every six to
 eight weeks,  under comparable or even more inhospitable
 conditions.   This is an indicator of required effort for
 investment in the transmission system alone.
 So, when you talk about overall magnitude of outlays
 of investment for capacity to develop and transport oil
 for 1976-80 and beyond, no expert would hazard a guess as
 to how many billions of dollars of Western help would be
 required to run production of oil up..
 Senator Roth.   I believe at one point you said the
 Soviets may seek assistance from us.   Would you be a
 little more specific about the kind of assistance they
 might want?

 Admiral Turner.  I think it is primarily our techno-
 logy they are after and that they can only get if they
 have hard currency or credits in hard currency areas;
 specifically,, we have referred several times to the techno-
 logy for oil development.  Today it is techniques for
 getting it out of the ground under existing conditions.
 But as they move into the frozen north more,  I think they
 will be looking to us for all kinds of technology in
 pipeline development, exploration techniques, and.so on.

 SOVIET ECONOMY - CONSUMER PRESSURES
 Senator Javits.  I have two questions and I will ask
 them separately.  You spoke of per capita consumption
 diminishing to a 2 percent annual growth rate for the
 individual in the Soviet Union.  We constantly hear that
 every once in -a while they have to divert from their
 fundamental concentration of roughly 13 percent of the
 GNP on military weaponry, et cetera, in order to do some-
 thing for the civilian sector.                     What causes them to do that?
 There is no public opinion, there are no elections, there
 is no press, there is no radio, no television.  Why do
 they have any need to respond at all to the individual?
 I have been to the Soviet Union on a number of
 occasions.  The people seem to be fairly well shod.   I
 am told that they eat adequately -- after all, you can
 live on pretty little compared to the way we operate
 around here.
 What is the pressure on them to do anything for the
 consumer?
 Admiral Turner.   Let me ask some of the Soviet experts.
 Doug?
 Mr. Diamond.   Senator, there are really three types of
 pressures.   As we measure Soviet per capita consumption,
 it is roughly one-third of the U.S., perhaps half that of
 Approved For Release 2002/05/09 : CIA-RDP90-01137R000100050004-0
 Approved For Release 2002/05/09 3SCIA-RDP90-01137R000100050004-0
 Western European, and 70 percent of that of Hungary and
 Poland.
 Secondly,  in particular areas, such as quality of
 diet, one out of every two calories they consume is still
 from starchy staples, such as grains and potatoes.  Their
 starchy-staple ratio is the highest of any advanced in-
 dustrial country in the world.   Meat_ consumption is 40
 percent of ours and 70 percent of that of Poland and
 Hungary.  The queues for certain kinds of goods, especi-
 ally selected high quality foods, are long.  Perhaps
 you may have seen them.
 we have had reporting over the last year of consider-
 ably more discontent in the mid 1970's than there was at
 the end of the 1960's.   This does. not show in rioting,
 as it did in 1962, when Khrushchev raised prices on some
 foods, but it may show up in a lower level of productivity,
 for example.
 Senator Proxmire. Did you say a lower level of
 productivity?
 Mr. Diamond.  A lower rate of growth in labor pro-
 ductivity,  and that includes absenteeism.
 Thirdly,  it is widely believed. that Russians are more
 stoic than their counterparts in Eastern Europe.   The Poles
 will take to the streets more quickly.  But, when Brezhnev
 and his colleagues observe what happened in Eastern Europe

 Approved For Release 2002/05/0938 C)A-RDP90-01137R000100050004-0
 over the last 20 years, especially widespread demonstrations
 in Poland in-1970 and 1976, this causes their concern. .
 Because of these kinds of pressures we judge that the
 leadership will feel that some growth in per capita con-
 sumption is required although they.will be unable to prevent
 a slowdown.
 Senator Javits.   For me, the most important part of
 what you have said has-been the figures,  that they live
 only 70 percent as well as the Hungarians and the Poles,.
 and 50 percent as well as the West Europeans.
 I think that is all extremely important.   I think
 that we, in the Congress, should be very interested in
 to what extent the public is manifesting its will some-
 how,                       even in a country which is held in such an iron grip
 as this one.   I gather, as a necessary corollary,  that as
 far as the military people are concerned, they eat all
 right and sleep all right if they are not subjected to any
 of these problems.   Is that correct?
 Mr.  Diamond.   Yes,  sir.   They get their daily rations.
 Senator Javits.   The Russian soldier in my father's
 day was very expendable.       He ate almost anything, he slept
 anywhere,  and he was literally a slave.   But that is no
 longer true.                           -
 Admiral Turner.   But his pay is not good if he is a
 conscript,  and you are aware,      sir, of the signs of dis-

 content we have had, such as the pilot who flew the aircraft
 to Japan.
 I do not want to portray that as a major problem at
 this point, but at least it is interesting as an indicator.
 Senator Javits.  On the positive side you are able
 to testify that they are taken pretty good care of, isn't
 that right?
 Mr. Diamond.  That is right, sir, in a comparative
 sense, inside their own economy, but not by our standards.
 Senator Javits.  I understand that,  of course.   I
 just told you about Russian soldiers from my personal
 experience.  I know from whence they come.
 But I was interested in where they are now.
 The other thing that interests me is your statement,
 which I want you to confirm,  that the U.S.S.R. will ex-
 perience a hard currency squeeze in the 1980's.   This means
 that they may have to turn to us even more for credits and
 technology.
 This is a critical point for this reason.   The U.S.S.R.
 and the Eastern Bloc owes Western Europe about $30 billion
 right now,  and the United States is only in for about
 $5 billion,  that is,  United States banks.   As a matter of
 fact,     it is only about $1.5 billion to'the U.S.S.R.

 SOVIET ACCESS TO CREDIT AND TECHNOLOGY OF WEST
 There is a big policy question which you may not even
 want to answer at this time.  You may wish to think about
 it.    There are certain factual questions which relate to
 this question of policy.
 Should we continue this policy of relatively easy
 access to the credit markets of the world by the U.S.S.R.?
 Or,    should we turn against it in a very affirmative and
 decided way and use that, by linkage, with Angola, the
 Middle East, or any other place?
 The same is true of technology over which we have
 surrendered control.
 On the other hand,  it is said that the Russian hardness
 on the Jewish emigration question was attributable to the
 limitation of $300 million in Export-Import Bank lending,
 which is meaningless to them now, except as a matter of
 respectability, which was imposed by the Congress.
 This to me is the critical area, these economic
 questions.   The question I would like to ask you Admiral,
 is what facts do you have to cast light on this question.
 This is what I would like to get at.   This is to me
 the basic question:   what leverage is there in the economic
 and technology relations between the.United States and the
 Soviet Union that if,  as a matter of policy, we wish to
 employ -- and that is not your business, it is our business

 and the President's -- we could?   We have to know what are
 our capabilities.   And I ask you, are we abreast of that?
 Admiral Turner.   My best response to that at the
 moment,  Senator Javits,  is that I feel a great responsi-
 bility to provide you the factual information that would
 help you approach that decision.   I feel that one of the
 most significant things about this long-term forecast
 of the Soviet economy that we have presented today is that
 it highlights that the Soviets have a limited number of
 options for what we think is a serious problem.

 SOVIET ECONOMY
 Senator McClure.   I have only two questions and
 perhaps you have already touched on these.
 Do you note any diversion within the Soviet economy
 away from military production and toward energy production?
 With reference to all of the demands on pipeline building
 and the rest of it,  I have not seen any diversion away
 from military production in order to meet that energy
 need.
 Senator McClure.   It would seem to me,  then,  that
 the    corollary is that if they have this tremendous problem
 confronting them,  then military preparedness has all of
 the priority which we have attributed to them in that
 area in the past.
 Admiral Turner.   That is our view,  though we don't
 know how they will weigh that if and when this prediction
 really dawns upon them.
 Senator McClure.  So we don't know for. sure whether
 we can supply the technology or the economics for that
 energy-production.   It would certainly reduce the pressure
 for diversion, of those things from energy production, but
 it might not result in any difference except increased
 energy capacity?

 Senator McClure.  The other question is in regard to
 the point,       a very cogent point,  that Senator Javits made
 about the relative standard of living of the Russian people.
 If they are only at 70 percent of the Eastern European
 countries and at 50 percent of western Europe,  that is
 significant, but it is significant only if they conceive
 it in that way.   If they are nevertheless moving up,  if
 their standard of living is rising each year and they feel
 relatively better off this year than last year and they
 don't know that they are worse off than someone else,  that
 would have little significance, wouldn't it?
 Admiral Turner.   Yes.   I believe that what you are
 saying is.certainly the right perception;  that what the
 Soviet consumer sees of his relative position is probably
 more dominant in his thought than any hypothetical com-
 parison with outside.                          However, I don't think we can
 discount outside influence completely because of the
 increasing amount of communication in the world today.
 Even the Soviets.-are travelling more than they used to.
 Senator McClure.  That would then'indicate that increased
 contacts between countries might exacerbate that domestic
 problem for them?
 Admiral Turner.   It certainly would have some input.

 SOVIET GRAIN PRODUCTION
 Senator McClure.   Thank you very much.
 I have no further question.
 Senator Proxmire.  Admiral, do you have any preliminary
 estimates of Soviet grain production this year, what their
 targets are and what they are likely to achieve?
 Mr. Diamond.  The target.is 213.3 million tons
 this year.
 Senator Proxmire.  Just what does that mean?   How
 much of a dropoff is the expectation?
 Mr.  Diamond. Last year's production was 224 million
 metric tons and that was a record.   Moscow would probably
 consider anything over 200 million to be quite satisfactory.
 The Department of Agriculture has a preliminary
 estimate of 225 million tons.   we agree with that estimate,
 although it must be stressed that it is very early in
 the season.   Much of the grain remains unripened, very
 little has been harvested.   Right now, however, growing
 conditions are very good.
 Senator Proxmire.   An article in "The Washington Post"
 about six weeks ago reports that the figures for meat
 production for the Soviet Union are lower than for the same
 period last year and that the planned industrialization of
 agriculture is not likely to succeed'uriless the resources
 allocated to the military are reduced.
 Can you comment on that?

 Mr. Diamond.    Meat production in the first quarter
 of this year remained below the first quarter of 1976.   It
 is just starting to turn up as the result of a sharp
 upturn in use of feedgrains from the record 1976 crop.
 Senator Proxmire.   Well,  is there a connection--have
 they reduced in any way their military. expenditures?
 Mr.  Diamond.   Oh,.absolutely not.   There is no direct
 relationship.

 at all?

 STEAM A - TEAM B REVIEW OF CIA
 Senator Proxmire. Admiral,  I would like to ask you
 about some criticisms of the CIA.  I am sure that you
 remember the controversy over the so-called Team B review
 of last. year's National Intelligence Estimates of Soviet
 strategic capabilities.
 ,At that time I made a public comment that criticism
 of the intelligence process was healthy and that conflicting
 ideas made good estimates.   At the same time,  I was highly
 critical of having one ideological group with. one viewpoint
 represented as the only outside critical review body.
 Do you intend to have intelligence estimates reviewed
 by-any outside panels,     and if so, will you insure that a
 wide body of opinion is represented?
 Admiral Turner.   Yes,  sir.   I am moving toward that.
 Senator Proxmire.   It was a view that was very good
 and intelligent.   I think that General Keegan is a man of
 great ability and I admire his ability.   But he represents
 a particular viewpoint,  and the other viewpoint, which it
 might be also wholesome and healthy to have, did not seem
 to be represented.
 Admiral Turner.   I think an ideologically structured
 Team A-Team B thing is not a normally good idea.  I would
 not reject it entirely, but I think it is something upon
 which I would look with suspicion.

 I think Teams A and Teams B can be good.  My first hope
 is to put into the process that we have, as a standard matter,
 enough divergent opinions that we do not have to go out and
 get Teams A and Teams B.  I would hope that we have that
 interplay right within our organization, possibly by bringing
 in outsiders on an ad hoc basis, if particular skills or
 viewpoints are needed.
 Senator Proxmire.  I can understand that and I think that
 makes for a neater operation.  But at the same.time I would
 think that some people outside, who are not subject to the
 discipline or the inhibitions that any person in the organiza-
 tion is likely to be, would be freer to be more aggressive and
 more critical in suggesting areas where the CIA may be off
 Admiral Turner.  I think that is basically true.  I am
 planning to create a group of consultants. We will look at a
 particular estimate that is being done, such as this one on
 strategic forces, and we will call from that group the right
 mix of people to join in the estimate.  This would not be on
 a full-time basis, but we would ask them to come from the be-
 ginning of the exercise and to follow it right through and to
 critique as we go along.
 Senator Proxmire.  The public debate over the Team B
 episode seemed to indicate that the so-called hard-liners won
 the day and forced the CIA-to re-evaluate its opinions about
 Soviet military strength.

 Did that in fact happen?
 Admiral Turner.   I really have not dug into that, Senator.
 But the CIA people assure me that that is not the case.
 In addition, the story got vastly distorted in the press.
 Senator Proxmire.   As I remember the articles--which I
 thought were real shockers--in the "New York Times," there
 were 25 specific points covering a wide spectrum of differences
 of opinion voiced by General Keegan.  I wrote a letter to the
 head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff asking him to comment on each
 one.   But it was not just a narrow area, at least not according
 to General Keegan's criticisms.   It was rather broad.
 At any rate, General Keegan has publicly taken the CIA
 to task for a variety of mistakes, ranging from myopia to
 deliberately hiding the facts from the policy-makers.   For
 example, he suggested that;   the CIA has consistently under-
 estimated the Soviet threat; the CIA contrived to reduce
 the estimated range of the Backfire bomber in order to salvage
 the SALT II accords; the CIA has become politicized; the
 intelligence community has been wrong about parity and wrong
 about virtually every great Soviet scientific and military
 advance since World War II.
 Let's take those in order.
 Has the CIA consistently underestimated the Soviet
 threat?

 Admiral Turner.   I don't believe so, no.   .
 Senator Proxmire.   Has the CIA contrived to reduce the
 estimated range of the Backfire bomber in order to salvage
 the SALT II accords?
 Admiral Turner.   No.
 Senator Proxmire.   What about the argument of politiciza-
 tion of the CIA?                          what-is your answer to that?
 Admiral Turner.   I won't speak for the past, but I will
 defend to the death that we are not politicized today, sir.
 I feel that my responsibility is to stand clear of the policy-
 makers and to give the President, the Senate, and the House
 objective, unbiased intelligence to the best that a human
 being can do that.
 Senator Proxmire.   What about the charge that the
 intelligence community--not just the CIA, but the whole in-
 telligence community--has been wrong about parity and wrong
 about virtually every great Soviet scientific and military
 advance since world War II?   What is your answer to that?
 Admiral Turner.   I think that that is-an incorrect
 generalization.   I cannot imagine that the intelligence com-
 munity, or the CIA, has been wrong on every advance that the
 Soviets have made.
 Senator Proxmire.   Exactly the opposite has been my im-

 the other agencies have been.
 Admiral Turner.   I. believe we have been generally accurate
 and objective.
 As a military officer, I have always valued the CIA

 SOVIET ARMS EXPORTS
 Senator Proxmire.   Can you give us figures for total
 Soviet arms exports during the past five years.
 Admiral Turner.   Yes,  sir,  I am sure we can.   Can't
 Mr.  Diamond.   Yes,          sir.
 Senator Proxmire.   Would you get that to us for the
 record?
 Admiral Turner.   We would be pleased to do so, Senator
 Proxmire.

 This table reflects a substantial upward revision of the dollar
 value of Soviet arms exports and agreements in 1972-75 made
 possible by new information on Soviet prices  for major items
 of equipment.
 Senator Proxmire.   what is the confidence level of margin
 of error for the figures in that area?  Are the estimates
 reliable to within 10 percent, or to a factor of two or

 three--in the Soviet arms exports?
 Mr.  Diamond.   Yes,  sir.   We will make that a part of
 the record,      too,  Senator.   I cannot answer that right now.
 Senator Proxmire.     All right.
 COMMITTEE INSERT
 Soviet delivery values are considered to be reliable
 within 20 percent.        In fact, they should be considered
 a minimum figure; undetected shipments of weapons systems
 and related equipment and unknown additional price increases
 could raise the total values by as much as 20 percent.
 Senator Proxmire.   Does the latest information suggest
 that at the present time they are exporting more.  What
 does your most recent data indicate?
 Mr.  Diamond.   I think the facts are that it has levelled
 off.  There is a change in the mix, a change in the com-
 position.
 Admiral Turner.   There is another point that I have
 asked to have studied very carefully,  Senator,  and that
 is the difference between aid agreements and aid deliveries.
 Generally speaking;       their deliveries are considerably
 behind their commitments.
 Senator Proxmire.    Do the estimates include spare
 parts, military construction, supporting equipment, and
 supporting services, as well as weapons?

 COMMITTEE INSERT
 The data on Soviet military deliveries include military
 hardware (land armaments, aircraft, missile systems, and
 naval boats); support equipment such as radar, communica-
 tions gear, and vehicles; and an estimated allowance to
 cover ammunition,  spare parts,  and unidentifiable support
 items that normally are received by military forces.
 Excluded are the costs of military construction, training,
 technical assistance, and supply operations.  While this
 aspect of the Soviet program is relatively small, it could
 increase delivery levels by 10-15 percent annually.

 SOVIET WEAPONS
 .Senator Proxmire.   Would you agree that Soviet weapons
 possess less sustainability and reliability than.U.S.
 weapons?         For example, is it correct that Soviet logistics
 are not too good, that they do not have good turn-around
 capabilities,  that they have a kind of throw-away philosophy
 with regard to many of their combat units and weapons?
 Admiral Turner.   I am reluctant to go quite that far.
 There are lots of elements to logistics.   In terms of
 quantity I think there is evidence in Europe,  for instance,
 that Soviet logistics are not bad, particularly in the
 Warsaw Pact arena.
 Senator Proxmire.  What about reliability?
 Admiral Turner.  Soviet equipment tends to be more
 simplistic in design than is ours, but it is generally
 reliable for the purpose for which it is intended.
 Senator Proxmire.   How about turn-around capabilities?
 Admiral Turner.      By turn-around, do,you mean if it is
 broken down, can they repair it and bring it back again?
 Senator Proxmire.  That's right.
 Admiral Turner.       I don't really have a specific
 opinion on that.   I will try to see what we can give you.
 Sayre,  did you want to say something?
 Mr.  Stevens.   Well,    as the Director mentioned,  their
 design is often focused on simplicity.

 Approved For Release 2002/05/09 : SIIA-RDP90-01137R000100050004-0
 Senator Proxmire.   That shocld be helpful to them..
 Mr. Stevens.  Yes, indeed.  It often is. .The very
 lack of sophistication in Soviet equipment makes many
 items easy to repair by relatively unskilled personnel.
 Senator Proxmire.   Would you agree that due to the
 lack of precision engineering and quality control in their
 defense production that there is a likelihood that many
 of their weapons will not fire?  Do they have a serious
 reliability problem in that sense?
 Admiral Turner.  I would not be willing to agree with
 that right off hand, Senator.   Their equipment is in many
 cases more elementary than ours, but is usually does the
 job.
 Senator Proxmire. Have analyses of Soviet weapons
 such as the MIG-25 disclosed problems of sustainability
 or reliability,  or any other problems concerning the
 quality of production?
 Admiral Turner.  Sayre?
 Mr.  Stevens..  The people who have looked at that equip-
 ment feel that if the design were taken one step further
 and a production engineering job were done on it,  it would
 be possible to make it more effective and cheaper to pro-
 duce than is now the case.   The emphasis now is often on

 ease of production and the use of interchangeable parts.  The
 ability to perform the design mission is never compromised,
 however.
 Admiral Turner.   Overall, Senator,  I have had the
 impression over the years that the Soviets could not main-
 tain their equipment in as high standards of year-round
 reliability as can we; but that if they knew when war was
 going to start, they could peak at a very high level of
 readiness and reliability.
 Senator Proxmire.   Did the analysis of the MIG-25
 show it to be less technologically advanced and more
 expensive than we had thought.it was?
 Admiral Turner.   I will ask Dr.  Stevens to supplement
 my thoughts on this because he has been in on this in
 greater detail,  I am sure.   My reaction to your question
 is a qualified yes.  That is, the internals of the airplane
 were not as sophisticated as they would have been had we
 designed the aircraft, but the overall capability is there.
 Sayre?
 Mr. Stevens.   That is right.   It is a design choice.
 Senator Proxmire.   That would increase its cost, wouldn't
 it?     My question was two-fold.   First,  it went to the
 effectiveness of the weapon, of the MIG-25 and the techno-
 logical advancement of the MIG-25;                          second,  it went to the
 cost.

 You wouldn't say that it cost more, or that it
 probably performed reasonably well because of the redundancy
 they have built in at considerable cost, would you?
 Mr. Stevens.  That is right.  The use, for example,
 of tubes in the electronics of that aircraft may have
 surprised some people.   The use of integrated circuits,
 of solid state stuff, would produce more reliable electronics,
 and probably cheaper electronics--if that were the only
 comparison to be made.
 -      Senator Proxmire. Do you mean that they are still
 using vacuum tube technology?
 Mr.  Stevens.   There was vacuum tube technology in the
 MIG-25.
 Admiral.Turner. But there were other things, such as
 steel,  in it,  too,   right?
 Mr.  Stevens.   Right,  stainless steel instead of
 titanium.
 Admiral Turner.   Of course, working titanium is
 frightfully more expensive, but it gives you a real payoff
 in performance.   This is true today,  so you can imagine
 the difference in cost when the MIG-25 was designed--1961-
 1963.

 CHINESE ECONOMY AND DEFENSE
 Senator Proxmire.   I have only a few questions on China.
 To what extent was the poor performance in China due
 to earthquakes and other natural disasters, and would there
 have been growth but for the natural disasters?
 Admiral Turner.   would you tackle that one, Mike?
 Mr.  Field.   Poor performance in China last year was
 due both to one-time factors and to longer-run ones.  The.
 earthquake was certainly one of the most serious in the last
 century.  It ranks with the great Tokyo earthquake of 1927.
 The loss of life was very severe,  and it was in a highly
 industrialized area in North China.   The earthquake alone
 might have taken 1 to 2 percentage points off the rate of
 industrial growth.
 A second factor in the low rate of growth was the
 political disruption connected with the deaths of Chou and
 Mao and with the throwing out of Mao's widow and the rest
 of the "gang of four."   When we look at the output by
 province--those for which we have some information--we see
 a definite correlation between the degree of political
 disruption and the economic performance.   This is a second
 reason for the poor performance.  -
 Then there are long-run factors.   Problems in the
 allocation of investment over the last five to ten years
 resulted in bottlenecks.  The whole extractive industry is
 Approved For Release 2002/05/09 : CIA-RDP90-01137R000100050004-0
 Approved For Release 2002/05/09 : (;64-RDP90-01137R000100050004-0
 underdeveloped.  For example, the demand for nonferrous
 metals for which they have ores is higher than their ability
 to produce.   So they have had to import,  to. spend hard
 currency to import nonferrous metals.
 In the iron and steel industry,. emphasis has been-too
 much on the crude steel capacity and not enough on the
 iron ore extraction or rolling.  So, these problems in
 the allocation of investment have created bottlenecks.
 The last factor I would say that is a long-run factor
 is productivity.   There has been very little improvement
 in the wages or the standard of living for the industrial
 labor force.   In times of political disruption, when the
 Chinese workers have had a chance to.express their opinions,
 they have demanded higher wages.   This dissatisfaction
 with wages, of course,  gets translated into poor morale
 and low productivity.
 So, the poor performance is therefore a combination
 of the earthquake and the political disruption that are
 one-time,  short-term factors,- and then of various under-
 lying problems,                         such as allocation of investment and problems
 of handling incentives.
 Senator Proxmire.   Thank you very much.
 It would seem that the Chinese represent a very, very
 powerful force on the continent around China, particularly

 Approved For Release 2002/05/09 : CIA-RDP90-01137R000100050004-0
 in Korea and in Vietnam and other parts of the Asian land
 mass,  but that they are of virtually no military significance
 elsewhere.   That is just my instinct in view of their size
 and in view of the kind of force that they have.
 You conclude that the Chinese rely on copies of Soviet
 weapons developed in the 1950's.   Would you summarize to
 what extent Chinese aircraft, missiles,  ships,  and ground
 equipment are basically copies of Soviet designs of the
 1950's.
 Admiral Turner.   They are very largely copies of those.
 Senator Proxmire.   They are about 20 years behind
 the Soviet Union,  let alone ourselves, technologically,
 isn't that so?
 Admiral Turner.   Yes, I would say 15 to 20 years.
 Mr.  Stevens.   They have,  for example, built a fighter
 aircraft,    a Chinese version of the MIG-21, which is in
 very limited production.
 Senator Proxmire.   When was the MIG-21 first built
 in the Soviet Union?     Was it in the 1950's?
 Mr.  Stevens.   It was the late 1950's.
 Senator Proxmire.    And China's MIG-21 is in only limited
 production?   It is evidently not a great success.
 Mr.  Stevens.   That's right.
 On the other hand,         they apparently have built a nuclear
 submarine and they are capable of producing advanced radars.

 But in general, when it comes to aircraft, ships, and
 so on,    what they have done is taken the equipment that the
 Soviets gave them before the break and improved upon it.
 But it is equipment of older Soviet design.
 Admiral Turner.   But they are developing their own
 strategic rocket. force,  their own intercontinental missile
 force.    They are doing that on their own_

 committee have said and I want to emphasize it.   You have
