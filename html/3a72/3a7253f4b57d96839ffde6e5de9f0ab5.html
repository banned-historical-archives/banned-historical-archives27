 CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
 Directorate of Intelligence
 23 December 1976
 INTELLIGENCE MEMORANDUM:   China After the Purge
 The arrest on 6 October of what the Chinese have
 come to call the "gang of four"--the leading leftists
 on the Politburo--was a widely popular move that has
 dramatically changed the face of Chinese politics.   In
 the wake of this decisive act--and of another watershed,
 the death of Mao Tse-tung a month earlier--the new Chi-
 nese leadership is consolidating its grip on power, ex-
 amining many ongoing policies, and seeking to work out
 new relationships among its leading members.   This
 process is likely to take some time.   Already some of
 the momentum imparted by the initial blow against the
 leftist chieftains has been dissipated.   The regime
 has, moreover, been surprisingly slow in coming to grips
 with a number of pressing personnel problems,  and it
 has appeared to be in a dither over some re-emerging po-
 litical problems that had been submerged in the euphoria
 of early October.
 Legitimacy-
 .One central problem facing the new leadership is
 that of its own legitimacy.   The new party chairman,
 Hua Kuo-feng, was elected to that post by the remaining
 members of the Politburo only after the four leftists
 had been eliminated, and the document announcing his
 elevation appears to acknowledge tacitly that merely a

 "rump" Politburo took the action.   Despite public
 claims to the contrary, Hua's promotion has not yet
 been formally approved by the party Central Commit-
 tee, and is therefore legally "unconstitutional."
 Many of the acts engineered by the party's left
 wing in the decade since the onset of the Cultural
 Revolution--in particular the moves against former
 vice premier Teng Hsiao-ping earlier this year--were
 widely criticized as "illegal" by more conservative
 party members.   It is ironic, and undoubtedly awk-
 ward for the regime, that the central. act in a de-
 velopment that has been billed as a restoration of
 party order and proper procedure should itself be
 "illegal."   There are no indications that a plenum
 of the party Central Committee will he held any time
 soon to endorse Hua's promotion, and in fact his au-
 thority at this juncture rests only cn two supports.
 The first is an ambiguous remark attributed to Mao--
 "with you in charge I am at ease"--which makes no ex-
 plicit reference to the chairmanship of the party;
 the second is raw military power.
 Hua as Chairman
 Currently, Hua holds three major posts:   chairman
 of the party Central Committee, chairman of the party's
 Military Affairs Commission, and premier.   Nominally,
 this gives Hua a wider range of authority than Mao
 ever held--the late leader was never premier.   But
 Hua's retention of the premiership in addition to his
 newly acquired posts may be a sign of weakness rather
 than strength.   Hua has been on the national stage for
 only five years; he was brought to Peking from a pro-
 vincial post in November 1971.   For much of those five
 years he was more of a bit player than a leading actor;
 he was appointed acting premier only  in early February
 of this year.   Hua consequently lacks the long-standing
 personal and professional ties to secondary military
 and civilian leaders which Chou En-lai and Teng Hsiao-
 ping--or for that matter the fallen ":successors" Liu

 Shao-chi and Lin Piao--had forged through years of
 civil war and national administration.
 The modest beginnings of a "personality cult"
 around Hua are already apparent--adulation of the new
 leader was particularly noticeable at a recent meet-
 ing of the National People's Congress Standing Commit-
 tee and at a national conference on agricultural af-
 fairs--but much of the praise of the new chairman seems
 somewhat defensive, designed to respond to unspoken
 questions as to Hua's qualifications for his high posi-
 tion.  Contrary to some Western news accounts, there
 has been little overt opposition to Hua
 in ract
 much of the popularity of the move agains     e left
 seems to have rubbed off on the new chairman.   But it
 is nevertheless true that Hua remains an unknown
 quantity to much of the population and even to many
 officials.
 Much of the "personality cult" propaganda seeks
 to portray Hua as a conciliator in the mold of Chou
 En-lai; the first "quotations" attributed to the new
 chairman emphasize caution and sober assessment.   In-
 deed, Hua showed great adroitness in forging an alli-
 ance with much of the military establishment in the
 months immediately preceding Mao's death, and the de-
 cisiveness of the move against the left in October
 surprised many Chinese as well as foreign observers.
 Curiously, however, the semi-official account of the
 events leading up to the arrests on 6 October attri-
 bute much of this decisiveness to Defense Minister
 Yeh Chien-ying rather than to Hua; in this account
 Hua is said to have temporized while Yeh pressed for
 action.

 Hua's caution in this as in other matters may
 stem in part from his uncertainty as to the person-
 alities and ultimate loyalty of many second- and
 third-echelon officials; Hua's lack of long-standing
 Approved For Relea
 25X1
 Approved For Release 2005/01/11 : CIA-RDP85T00353R000100350005-3
 ties to these officials is probably an inhibiting
 factor in his own calculations.
 Hua was apparently surprised and disturbed to
 discover in the weeks after.Mao's death that the
 leftist quartet were planning to hold a plenum of
 the party Central Committee, presumably to strengthen
 their position.   Leftists are a minority--a signi-
 ficant minority--in that body; the evidence that the
 "gang of four" was prepared to place its confidence
 in the Central Committee, however, may well have con-
 vinced Hua that they had made some headway in
 "winning over" additional members of the committee
 to their side.  Until he and his closest allies can
 fully identify and weed out convinced leftist sympa-
 thizers among its members, they are unlikely to con-
 vene a Central Committee plenum to ratify the actions
 of 6-7 October.   Indeed, as time passes the odds rise
 that rather than hold a plenum, the regime may con-
 vene a party congress to elect a new central commit-
 tee, thus obviating the problem.
 The Leftists
 In fact, the arrest of the "gang of four"--Mao's
 widow Chiang Ching, former party vice chairman Wang
 Hung-wen, former vice premier Chang Chun-chiao, and
 chief propagandist Yao Wen-yuan--has eliminated the
 left wing of the party as a threat to its current
 leaders, but it has not eliminated the leftist move-
 ment as a problem for the regime.   At least a fourth
 of the 30-million-strong party retains leftist sympa-
 thies; this proportion is probably higher at the
 lower levels of the party machine and among the young
 people who make up the bulk of recent inductees into
 the party.   Even a widespread and fairly indiscrimi-
 nate purge would remove only a fraction of this huge
 mass of leftist sympathizers.
 The weeding-out process, however, is well under
 way, both in Peking and in the provinces.   Easily

 identified second-echelon leftist leaders have prob-
 ably already been eliminated, and in recent weeks
 provincial party leaders, newspapers, and radio broad-
 casts have begun to echo military propaganda organs
 in calling for a widespread and uninhibited purge of
 the "agents" of the "gang of four."  There has been
 no large-scale resistance to the actions against the
 leftists, although in the immediate aftermath of the
 arrest of the "gang of four" the situation was tense
 in Shanghai, the home base of three of the leftist
 quartet, and perhaps in Paoting, Hupeh Province, 100
 miles from Peking.
 While the initial strike against the leftist
 leaders was accomplished with relative ease,  faction-
 alism does persist in many provinces.   In almost all
 cases the factional alignments date back to the chaotic
 days of the Cultural Revolution when fights over power
 and position at the provincial and lower levels were
 at their height.   As provincial leaders, almost all
 of whom are veteran cadre who were "rehabilitated" in
 the early 1970s, are endorsed and gradually given
 greater local authority by the central leaders, old
 scores are bound to be paid off as veteran aparachiks
 deal roughly with their leftist tormenters who managed
 temporarily to purge them.at the height of the Cul-
 tural Revolution.
 The beginning of this process accounts for the
 strident tone already observable in the provincial
 media.   But however brutal the repression, the pro-
 vincial leaders are unlikely to eliminate the leftist
 factions entirely.   Rather, they are likely merely to
 drive the leftist groupings into a largely inactive,
 semi-clandestine status analogous to the situation
 which existed in the 1970-73 period, when the reaction
 to the excesses of the Cultural Revolution was at its
 height.
 Indeed, the factional problem in the provinces--
 that is, conflict among two or more relatively powerful

 groupings as distinguished from the use of unbridled
 political power to suppress dissident cliques--is
 probably already in the decline.  Most of the refer-
 ences to factional troubles which have recently ap-
 peared in the provincial media and have been replayed
 in the Western press describe the situation which ob-
 tained last summer--before Mao's death and the arrest
 of the "gang of four."
 A more delicate problem for the new leaders in
 Peking is that of rooting out suspected leftists from
 military ranks.

 Hua in fact almost certainly sees a danger in al-
 lowing the purge of the left to get out of hand.   His
 cautious, temporizing style suggests that he was re-
 sponsible for an authoritative editorial in the People's
 Daily last month which called for limiting the purge
 of the leftists to ringleaders who were deeply in-
 volved with the "gang of four"---and which contrasted
 sharply with much more bloodthirsty calls to actions
 which were then appearing in military-controlled pub-
 lications.   Given the long-standing, deep-seated po-
 litical passions which have been unslaked since the
 Cultural Revolution, however, it is unlikely that the
 purge can easily be controlled.   Indeed, the most
 recent issue of the party's theoretical journal, Red
 Flag, contains an article which in its unbridled and
 indiscriminate attack on the left closely parallels
 those which have been appearing in the military
 journals.
 Hua's aim--and that of other like-minded leaders
 in Peking--seems to be to reduce the possibility that
 a wholesale and indiscriminate purge of suspected left-
 ists will build up such resentment among the numerous
 "losers" in the political readjustment now under way
 that new factional trouble, in the provinces and in
 Peking, would be all but inevitable.   China's politi-
 cal history over the past 15 years strongly suggests
 that this fear is a very sensible one.   The current
 emphasis on experience and on tested leaders which
 has been particularly apparent in military publica-
 tions, for.example, has almost certainly alienated
 considerable sections of China's youth, who see their
 hopes for succeeding to positions of real political
 responsibility fading into the distant future.
 In fact, the new leaders in Peking seem quite de-
 fensive about some aspects of the current political
 evolution.   They appear to recognize that the outright
 elimination of the leftist leaders on the Politburo
 coupled with the strong emphasis on order, production,
 discipline, and experience leaves them vulnerable to

 25X1
 Approved For Relea
 the charge that "revisionism" has triumphed in China
 In m.L -Nove   er in
 particular the central media went to some lengths to
 issue reassurances--presumably meant for the large
 numbers of lower level cadres whose sympathies are
 vaguely leftist but who have no close and direct ties
 to the "gang of four"--that the country has not taken
 a sharp turn to the right and that the Cultural Revolu-
 tion has not been repudiated wholesale.
 Policy Review
 Despite these reassurances, however, major changes
 have already occurred in areas where the leftists were
 particularly strong in the past decade--for example,
 in the fields of propaganda, culture, and education.
 The rigid cultural orthodoxy imposed by Chiang Ching
 has been somewhat relaxed, and writers and artists
 who had been criticized by the "empress" are now being
 praised for the correctness of their political outlook.
 Wholesale changes have been made in the upper levels
 of the propaganda machine, and the purge is now prob-
 ably extending down into the lower reaches of this
 bureaucratic sector.   A new emphasis on discipline and
 "book learning" in the classroom seems to be under way,
 and preparations are being made for greater reliance
 on examinations as a means of selecting candidates
 for university-level education.   Moreover, apart from
 the drumfire against the "gang of four," which is
 likely to go on for some time, the new authorities
 seem anxious to avoid--at least for the time being--EL
 new series of the incessant campaigns that have roiled
 China's political waters for more than a decade.
 Even more striking is the great emphasis which
 the central authorities are placing on economic con-
 struction,  industrial production, and orderly planning.

 They claim with considerable justification that the

 along these lines in the first nine months of 1976.

 They have cited the destruction caused by the
 earthquakes of last summer, balance of payments
 problems,  and the competing pressures of foreign
 exports against domestic consumption as difficulties
 which cannot easily be assessed or resolved.  A ma-
 jor review of China's economic situation is appar-

 Many of the difficulties now being mentioned
 by the economic experts were precisely the points
 raised by the leftist leaders to buttress their
 attacks on "revisionist" policies earlier this year.
 The persistence of these problems even in changed
 political circumstances underlines the basic struc-
 tural problems China faces in building a modern
 economy as well as the relatively narrow economic
 margin within which any leadership group in Peking
 must work in achieving this end.   Nevertheless,
 the context in which these basic problems are be-
 ing viewed has changed remarkably.   Lip service is
 still paid to the notion that "politics are in
 command," but actual emphasis is being placed on
 pragmatism, discipline, and expertise.   An ambitious
 program of agricultural mechanization, with which

 both Hua Kuo-feng and Teng Hsiao-ping are personally
 identified,  is again being pressed.   The idea of "self-
 reliance" has not been abandoned, bzt renewed emphasis
 has been placed on the importation of foreign tech-
 nology as a means of speeding the transition to a
 modern economy.   This approach, which was stressed with
 even greater vigor in 1975 than it is at present,
 languished following the fall of Teng last spring.
 In fact, despite a somewhat greater emphasis on
 realism and caution,  the entire economic program of
 Peking's current leaders is hardly distinguishable
 from that of Teng, who was being attacked viciously
 for his "capitalist-road" mentality by the leftists
 before they were purged.   The attacks on Teng have
 now been narrowed to his alleged inability to rec-
 ognize the importance of "class struggle"--a criti-
 cism attributed directly to Mao--and he has not beez
 mentioned in any context by China's top leaders or
 by the central media since the end of November.
 The Teng Problem
 In fact,  there is strong sentiment within the
 party apparatus and among some elemE:nts of the mili-
 tary leadership to "rehabilitate" T-E:ng once again--
 he was returned to prominence in 1973 after an
 initial purge in the early stages of the Cultural
 Revolution--on the ground that the charges against
 him were trumped up or distorted by the leftist
 quartet,,that Mao had intended to criticize but not
 to purge him, and that his removal from office in
 April was "illegal."   Teng is widely admired for his
 opposition to and contempt for the leftist leaders,
 whose political power he attempted to circumscribe,
 with some success,  in 1975.
 An investigation into the origins of the riot
 in Tienanmen Square in early April--the occasion of
 Teng's downfall--is now under way under the auspices
 of Defense Minister Yeh Chien-ying.   This investiga--
 tion will almost certainly clear Teng of any respon-
 sibility for the riot, placing the blame on the
 25X1
 Approved For Release 2005/01/11 : CIA-RDP85T00353R0g0100350005-3
 Approved For Re
 "gang of four."  Since the announcement of Teng's
 removal from office explicitly linked his fall with
 instigation of the riot, his second "rehabilitation"
 is probably inevitable.   He is already rumored to be
 an "adviser" to Hua Kuo-feng.
 Teng's "rehabilitation," however, presents a
 number of problems for the new leadership in Peking
 and for Hua Kuo-feng in particular.   If Teng's re-
 moval from office is declared to have been illegal,
 then it would seem to follow that a determination
 to this effect would automatically restore him to
 the posts he held before his latest fall--first
 vice premier, member of the Politburo Standing Com-
 mittee, and chief of staff of the PLA.   These are
 positions of great power, and it might be easy to
 make the argument that in them Teng would once more
 give free rein to his well-known tendency toward
 abrasiveness and autocratic decision-making.
 Still more important are the direct consequences
 to Hua Kuo-feng of Teng's return to power.   Hua has
 in effect stepped into Teng's shoes as party and
 government leader in succession to Mao and Chou En-
 lai.   Teng's return to office would underline that
 fact as well as provide a constant reminder that
 Teng, not Hua, was Chou En-lai's choice for the top
 posts in party and state.   In short, a resurgent
 Teng would be a natural rival to Hua, who might
 additionally hope to avoid the impression that he
 was a captive of the right wing of the party, where
 Teng's greatest support seems to lie.
 Hua Kuo-feng is not the only Chinese leader
 who may well have qualms about the restoration of
 Teng Hsiao-ping to positions of real authority.
 Continuing criticism of Teng in at least a few prov-
 inces suggests that several provincial leaders may
 have doubts about the wisdom of entrusting consider-
 able power to the abrasive Teng.

 Additionally, Peking party boss Wu Te, who was
 nominally in charge of the suppression of the
 Tienanmen riot, might suspect that a complete clear-
 ing of Teng would involve him in political difficul-
 ties.   Above all Vice Premier Li Hsien-nien, for-
 merly a strong supporter of Teng, may now have
 reservations about the return of the former leader
 to high office,  since Li himself is now the obvious
 candidate for the premier's job in succession to
 Hua.   None of these leaders is likely to oppose a
 nominal  "rehabilitation" of Teng Hs=_ao-ping;  it is
 his restoration to high office that might be troub-
 ling to them.
 On the other hand, Teng retains formidable
 assets.   Most second- and third-echelon party lead-
 ers have long-standing ties to Teng, and they would
 probably feel more secure in their own posts if
 Teng were again an official of consequence.   Hsu
 Shih-yu,  a Politburo member and the powerful com-
 mander of the Canton Military Region, appears to
 be an uncompromising supporter of the former vice
 premier.  Most importantly, Defense Minister Yeh
 Chien-ying seems to be firmly in Teng's corner, as
 he has been all year.   Indeed, Yeh's well-known de-
 votion to the memory of his close friend and col-
 league Chou En-lai might impel him to demand that

 Teng not only be restored to office, but that he
 be made premier in accordance with Chou's wishes.
 It is possible--although the evidence is scanty--
 that some such demand is the principal reason Li
 Hsien-nien has not formally been named premier de-
 spite frequent rumors that this move was about to
 be made.   In fact, the longer the regime delays
 taking this step the greater the odds that Teng be-
 comes a viable candidate for the premier's post.
 Musical Chairs
 The Teng Hsiao-ping problem and the issue of
 the premiership is the most intractable but cer-
 tainly not the only major personnel problem facing
 the new leadership.  The post of chairman of the
 National People's Congress--China's equivalent to
 head of state--has been vacant since the death of
 Chu Te last summer.  In October wall posters                      25X1

 that   e     ien-yang wouia assume                     with
 Peking Military Region Commander Chen Hsi-lien suc-
 ceeding him as defense minister and Li Hsien-nien
 taking the premier's portfolio.  This scenario was
 quickly denied by Foreign Mini.stry spokesmen in
 Peking, and the posters seemed to be a trial balloon
 floated on behalf of the ambitious Chen Hsi-lien.

 A more recent and persistent rumor claims that
 the chairmanship of the National People's Congress
 will be assigned to Peking party boss Wu Te, an
 obvious and leading candidate for the job, while
 Chen would be consoled with the post of minister
 of security--yet another job now nominally filled.
 by Hua Kuo-feng.   In this reading Yeh would remain
 in place as defense minister, Li Hsien-nien would.
 become premier,  and Teng Hsiao-ping would become
 "adviser" to Hua Kuo-feng, presumably as a first
 step to eventual resumption of his duties as first
 vice premier.   This in fact is a logical and likely
 scenario, but bargaining over the various posts in-
 volved is probably still under way.
 25X1
 The Military Problem
 In fact the relationship between leading mili-
 tary and civilian authorities will be the central
 factor in the Chinese political equation for some
 time to come.   Hua Kuo-feng's personal relationship
 Approved For Rele4se 2005/01/11 : CIA-RDP85T0035;R000100350005-3
 25X1
 Approved For Relo
 with leading military figures may well shape the im-
 mediate course of the political evolution now under
 way, but the issue certainly transcends purely per-
 sonal considerations of this sort.
 As Mao's health began rapidly to fail last sum-
 mer, Hua recognized that he would need military sup-
 port in the almost inevitable showdown with the
 "gang of four."  Adroitly, he strongly praised the
 army for its efforts in relief work following last
 summer's earthquakes.  Hua himself was deeply in-
 volved in the relief effort, and by simultaneously
 stressing the army's "devotion to duty" and identi-
 fying himself with its fortunes he formed a tacit
 alliance that was probably no less important than
 Adolf Hitler's more explicit pact with the German
 General Staff just before the death of President
 Hindenberg.   Implicit in this alliance was the
 thought that neither party could afford to see the
 "gang of four" triumph.
 The military establishment, for its part, had
 been to a greater or lesser degree in the political
 doghouse since former defense minister Lin Piao's
 attempted "coup" in late 1971.  Hua's words of
 praise were. the strongest endorsement of the mili-
 tary establishment since that event.  Most top
 military leaders, moreover, distrusted and in many
 cases strongly disliked the leftist quartet--a
 mutual antipathy that dated back to the Cultural
 Revolution.   Many--and Yeh Chien-ying in particu-
 lar--apparently believed that Hua, as premier and
 party first vice chairman, was the logical center-
 piece in any move to block a leftist grab for power
 after Mao's death--and even more importantly, the
 source of legitimacy for any pre-emptive move
 against the "gang of four."
 The action taken against the leading leftists
 was almost certainly pre-emptive.  The military not
 25X1
 25X1
 Approved For Rel

 only supplied the muscle that ensured its success
 but also appears to have had a major voice in urging
 that the action be taken.   As a result of its central
 role in the events of early October,  the military
 establishment is once again at the center of the
 political stage.   It is likely to demand political
 and institutional rewards for its "loyalty" in a
 period of crisis.
 Signs that the military will not be shy in
 making such demands are already evident.   Major an-
 nouncements and decisions are being made in the name
 of the party's Military Affairs Commission as well
 as those of the highest party and government orgar..s.
 Provincial and central media continue to be unstirt-
 ing in their praise of the army.   And military-
 controlled journals are not only speaking with great
 authority but have taken the lead in demanding a
 wide and thorough-going purge of leftists where-
 ever found,  in calling for greater discipline, and.
 in urging an increase in industrial production.
 Most extraordinary of all is the special atten-
 tion being accorded Yeh Chien-ying.  Adulation and
 a "cult of personality" are still being reserved for
 Hua Kuo-feng alone  (and for the deceased Mao and
 Chou En-lai), but Yeh is being treated with a def-
 erence--even a reverence--that actually rivals that
 accorded to Hua.   Yeh's picture is frequently
 coupled with that of Hua and on public occasions
 he receives almost equal billing with Hua.   This
 special treatment was never accorded to Chou En-la.i;
 it is reminiscent of that given to Lin Piao in his,
 heyday as Mao's "successor."
 At least at this point, however, the military
 does not seem to be playing a "usurper's" role.
 The military journals have been adamant in stress-
 ing the primacy of the party in all matters and in

 calling for military subordination to the highest
 party organs; this is in sharp contrast to the period
 of army ascendancy in the late 1960s, when the role
 of the party was all but ignored.  Moreover, the
 military journals themselves have taken the lead in
 promoting Hua Kuo-feng's "cult of personality."
 Until recently they alone were lavish in their
 praise of Hua as an individual.
 It is of course possible that all this merely
 represents an attempt on the part of the military
 establishment to promote Hua--and through him the
 party he heads--as a "front" for virtual military
 rule.
 ase                               000100350005-3
 25X1
 On the contrary, it is far more likely that
 the current military stress on the primacy of the
 party and on the individual importance of Hua
 Kuo-feng can be attributed to Yeh Chien-ying's
 sense of what is necessary in China's present po-
 litical circumstances.  By dint of his long service
 at the upper levels of the party as well as the
 military bureaucracy, Yeh appears to possess a
 "statesmanlike" view of political necessity and a
 loyalty to party shiboleths rather than a parochial
 and narrowly military outlook.
 Indeed, there is some evidence that rather
 than simply dictating to the party--and to Hua--
 the military establishment has not always found
 it easy to get its own way even on matters of con-
 siderable importance to it.  Last month's People's
 Daily editorial which called for a narrow and lim-
 ited purge of leftists contrasted sharply with the
 much more strident calls for a broad purge then
 being trumpeted-by the military journals..   If Hua
 himself was primarily responsible for the editor-
 ial, which seems likely, he is certainly not an
 Approved For Rele
 25X1
 Approved For Releas
 army puppet.   Nevertheless,  it is probably true that
 at this juncture he needs the military establishment
 even more than it needs him.
 This point can hardly have been lost on civil-
 ian party cadre, and it is probably worrying to
 them.   The civilian--and particularly the party-
 bureaucracy has spent much of the past five years
 wresting political power away from the military,
 which inherited administrative responsibility for
 running the country from the shattered party appar-
 atus during the Cultural Revolution.   It will almost
 certainly be unwilling to see its political authority
 eroded again, and its concerns on this score coupled
 with increasing military assertiveness are likely to
 lead to renewed tensions between the civilian author-
 ities and the military establishment.
 25X1
 25X1
 25X1
 Although in present circumstances potential
 civilian-military political rivalry in the prov-
 inces can probably be contained, a different set
 Approved For Releose 2005/01/11 : CIA-RDP85T00353R0g0100350005-3

 Approved For Rel
 of tensions is likely to persist at the national
 level.  Not only is the military establishment
 likely to press its political views forcefully on
 the civilians, but the PLA is also almost certain
 to demand a greater slice of China's limited budget
 to build up its partially obsolescent military ar-
 senal.                            Arguments on this score have persisted at
 least since the fall of Lin Piao, and they are un-
 likely to die away now that the military's political
 clout has obviously increased.   Military journals
 are already claiming that the "gang of four" sabo-
 taged Teng Hsiao-ping's plans for a leaner but bet-
 ter equipped military force.  Many of the civilians
 in Peking's current leadership, however, are eco-
 nomic administrators who advocate balanced economic
 growth without undue emphasis on military hardware.
 The emphasis these economic officials are cur-
 rently placing on the weakness of the Chinese econ-
 omy and on the limitations of China's resources
 could be related to pressures from the PLA for
 greater military spending.
 That establishment, however,  is not a monolith,
 and this fact probably gives Hua Kuo-feng and other
 top civilian leaders some room for maneuver as well
 as cause for additional concern.     Rivalries have
 long persisted among military leaders,  and these
 rivalries are not likely to vanish overnight. I

 In any event, Hua is likely to play off various
 groupings within the military against each other,
 thereby hoping to keep the army under control.   This
 is a potentially fruitful but somewhat dangerous
 game.   Teng Hsiao-ping appeared to play it in 1975,
 but his machinations may have cost rim the support
 of Chen Hsi-lien at the crucial moment when succes-
 sion to the premiership was at stake.
 This amalgam of troubling problems and unfin-
 ished business will not be mastered easily.   With
 the elimination of the leftist quartet from the
 Politburo the potential for leadership instability
 has diminished  dramatically  but has not disappeared.
 Those towering figures Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai
 are gone, and Hua Kuo-feng's staying power is still
 untested.   Low-level leftist resentment against the
 turn of political events persists, and rightist
 pressures to go further in the direction of "ration-
 alization" than is politically expedient remain
 strong.   Potentially destabilizing rivalry between
 Hua Kuo-feng and Teng Hsiao-ping or, more importantly,
 between the civilian and military bureaucracies
 looms in the background.   The new leaders have not

 25X1
 Approved For Release 2005/01/11 : CIA-RDP85TO0353R000100350005-3
 yet apportioned power among themselves and antagon-
 isms among military leaders remain a possibility.
 Underlying economic and demographic problems per-
 sist,                      and although they are likely to be tackled
 energetically, they cannot be easily solved.  More-
 over, the regime has not yet addressed such poten-
 tially troublesome problems of foreign policy as the
 relationship with the US and the USSR;  either or
 both could be the source of bitter dispute.
 From the point of view of the Chinese leader-
 ship,                      the current situation is probably more hopeful
 than any in the recent past.   The present lack of
 momentum in domestic affairs, however, suggests
 that as old problems are fading, new ones are coming
 to the fore.   Indeed, Chinese politics seem to be a
 perfect demonstration of the Hegelian dialectic:
 the solution to each major crisis bears within it
 the seeds of new, and perhaps equally complex,
 disputes.
