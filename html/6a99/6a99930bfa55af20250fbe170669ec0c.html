 INDIA-PAKISTAN
 MOSCOW DEFINES SECURITY INTEREST; PEKING DECRIES "BLACKMAIL"
 Deepening expressions of support by Moscow and Peking for their
 respective friends in the Indian-Pakistani conflict have been
 overlaid by polemical exchanges between the two communist powers
 that mark South Asia as a major arena of the Sino-Soviet
 rivalry.  A TASS statement on 5 December, the most authoritative
 Soviet policy statement since the intensification of hostilities
 on the 3d, defined a Soviet security interest in the conflict
 and implicitly warned the Chinese against deeper involverent.
 A vitriolic Chinese retort in the form of a PEOPLE'S DAILY
 Commentator article on the 7th, the seccnd of three successive
 commentaries on this level, charged that the TASS statement
 "smacks of gunpowder" and represents "barefaced blackmail and
 intimidation."  Pointing to questions of power politics
 invclved in the conflict, Commentator claimed that the Soviets
 are seeking to take advantage of the situation to expand their
 influence in the subcontinent and the Indian Ocean.
 The divergence between the positions taken by Moscow and Peking
 has broadened as the two sides have taken firmer stands on the
 East Pakistan separatist movement.  Though Moscow has not as yet
 followed New Delhi's lead in recognizing the Bangla Desh
 government, the Soviets have conferred a measure of legitimacy
 on the separatists by saying they are leading a "national
 liberation movement."  Peking, on the other hand, has flatly
 dismissed the Bangla Desh regime as a "puppet" set up by India
 to realize its aim to "annex" East Pakistan.  The PEOPLE'S
 DAILY Commentator article on the 8th, devoted to India's
 recognition of the Bangla Desh government two days earlier,
 ridiculed the Bengali separatists as a "small handful of Pakistan
 national outcasts."
 While Moscow and Peking have thus dug in deeper in supporting
 their friends, both sides continue to show caution regarding
 the broader security implications of the conflict.  Moscow,
 unlike New Delhi, has not cited the Soviet-Indian treaty and
 has not gone beyond the TASS statement in specifying the USSR's
 stake in the developments.  While Peking has made repeated
 references to the treaty, depicting it as an instrument of
 Soviet expansion in the region and an encouragement of Indian
 aggression, the Chinese have avoided portraying a threat to

 their security interests and passed over the warning conveyed
 in the TASS statement.  Chinese pledges of support for Pakistan
 against aggression have been formulated in the same terms and
 on the same level as before the recent intensification of
 hostilities.
 TASS CITES PAKISTANI REPRESSION. SOVIET SECURITY INTEREST
 The TASS statement of 5 December enunciated in familiar terms
 the Soviet position on the Indian-Pakistani crisis, outlined
 the evolution of that crisis, and called for a rapid cessation
 of hostilities, a political settlement in East Pakistan, and
 restraint by all other countries.  Contending that "the main
 cause" of Indian-Pakistani tensions was "the situation created
 in East Pakistan as a result of the Pakistan Government's
 act!ons against the population of that part of the country,"
 the statement noted that the Soviet Government had "repeatedly
 expressed" its concern over the situation to Pakistani
 President Yahya Khan and had called for "the renunciation
 of the policy of repressions, the release of [Awami League
 Leader Mujibur] Rahman, and the immediate resumption of talks
 with the aim  of finding such a solution tho` would accord
 with the will expressed by the population of East Pakistan
 at the elections in December 1970.1'  Since the Pakistani
 Government did not take measures for a political settlement
 and continued its military buildup against India, the state-
 ment continued, "the Soviet leaders informed. President Yahya
 Khan that Pakistan's armed attack against India, under
 whatever pretext, would evoke the most resolute condemnation
 in the Soviet Union."
 Raising the issue of a threat to Soviet security, TASS
 declared that "the Soviet Union cannot remain indifferent to
 the developments, considering also the circumstances that
 they are taking place in direct proximity of the USSR's
 borders and, therefore, involve the interests cf Its
 security."  The Soviet Government, TASS said, "finds it
 necessary to state to the Pakistan leaders with all clarity
 about the grave responsibility that they assume following
 this dangerous course."  Tile statement called for "the
 speediest ending of the bloodshed and for a political
 settlement in East Pakistan on the basis of respect for the
 lawful rights and interests of its people."

 8 DECEMBER 1971
 The statement concluded with a warning against outside involvement
 in the conflict.  The Soviet Government, according to TASS,
 urges "the governments of all countries" to "refrain from steps
 signifying in this way or that way their involvement in the
 conflict and leading to a further aggravation of the situation
 in the Hindustan peninsula."
 The TASS statement stands as the most authoritative exposition of
 Soviet policy on the intensified conflict.  On 8 December, in fact,
 TASS disseminated the statement again without explanation.  Soviet
 concern has also been expressed in briefer terms by the Soviet
 leadership troika.  CPSU chief Brezhnrv, speaking at the Polish
 party congress on the 7th, called for cessation of the bloodshed
 and a peaceful political settlement, taking particular note of
 "the events which engendered this conflict:  the bloody suppres-
 sion of the basic rights and clearly expressed will of the
 population of East Pakistan, and the tragedy of 10 million
 refugees."  President Podgornyy made similar remarks in
 speeches on the 7th and 8th.
 Premier Kosygin, speaking in Denmark on 4 December, expressed
 "great concern" over the emergence of "a dangerous seat of
 conflict" between India and Pakistan and called for liquidation
 of the conflict.  He placed the onus directly on Pakistan,
 observing that "it is necessary above all to overcome a
 dangerous domestic policy crisis that formed in East Pakistan
 as a result of wholesale reprisals" by the Pakistani authorities.
 Kosygin declared that "the will of the people of East Pakistan
 expressed in the December 1970 elc,:tions" must be implemented
 and security guaranteed for the return of the refugees.
 Relatively limited Soviet comment has been keyed largely to
 the TASS statement.  Thus, the commentators on the Moscow
 domestic service observers' roundtable on the 5th and a PRAVDA
 commentary on the 6th said the crisis resulted from "the armed
 repressions" against the East Pakistanis as a reprisal for
 their election of Mujibur's Awami League and its advocacy of
 autonomy for East Pakistan.  They also highlighted Pakistan's
 "military action on a very wide scale" and took particular
 note of past warnings to Pakistan cited in the TASS statement
 as well as the statement's reference to a Soviet security
 interest.

 8 DECEMBER 1971
 SOVIET-INDIAN    The TASS statement did not mention the Soviet-
 TREATY                                        Indian treaty of peace, friendship, and
 cooperation signed in August, and Soviet media
 have all but ignored the treaty in current comment.  Indian
 media on 4 December reported that Article 9 of the treaty had
 been invoked; it provides that in case either party "is
 attacked or threatened wil-h attack," the two countries will
 "immediately start mutual consultations with a v.ew to
 eliminating this threat and taking appropriate effective
 measures to insure peace and security for their countries."
 A report carried by Delhi radio on the 6th--but not monitored
 in Soviet media--said that the Indian ambassador had met that
 day with Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister Kuznetsov to
 "review the latest developments in the Indian subcontinent
 and the debate in the Security Council on the subject."  A
 rare Soviet reference to the treaty appeared in a TASS report
 on the 7th replying to the Chinese contention that the pact
 encouragFJ Indian aggression.
 REBUTTAL OF      Neither the TASS statement nor the Soviet
 CHINESE          leaders' remarks mentioned the Chinese
 position in tl-,e crisis, but Moscow has been
 driven into polemical jousting with the Chinese by their
 drumbeat of attacks and the exchanges taking place in the
 United Nations.  Previously the anti-Chinese polemics were
 concentrated in broadcasts to China over the purportedly
 unofficial Radio Peace and Progress, but by 7 December
 Moscow felt obliged to respond to Peking's production of
 "one anti-Soviet statement after another."
 A TASS report on that date rebuked the Chinese for "totally
 ignoring the unanimous support given by the East Pakistan
 population to the Awami League at the elections in December
 1970" and accused them of "whitewashing mass repressions and
 terror by the Pakistan authorities against the population
 of the eastern part of the country."  Noting that Chinese
 media "portray the genuine representatives of the East
 Pakistan population as 'Pakistani splitters,"' TA?S cited
 PRC opposition to hearing "representatives of the East
 Pakistan population" at Security Council meetings.  TASS
 concluded that Peking's propaganda "is added proof that the
 Chinese leadership couldn't care less about the destinies
 of the national liberation movement and the interests of
 anti-imperialist struggle."

 8 DECEMBER 1971
 Driving home the point, TASS less than an hour later reported
 a statement by "the foreign minister of Bangla Desh" in which
 "he denounced the 'exceedingly threatening role of the two
 superpowers, the United States and the PRC,' in discussing
 the Indo-Pakistani conflict in the Security Council."
 For several days prior to the TASS attack of the 7th, Peace
 and Progress broadcasts in Mandarin had vigorously condemned
 the Chinese role in the subcontinent.  Countering Peking's
 increasing attacks on the role of the Soviet-Indian treaty as
 an encouragement of Indian aggression, the commentaries
 portrayed Peking as an instigator of Pakistani extremists and
 reactionaries in the heightening of tensions and stressed the
 Soviet themes that the basic issue is repression in East
 Pakistan of a genuine "national liberation struggle."  The
 commentaries have also stressed that the Soviet position has
 been one of encouraging a peaceful political settlement of
 the problem.
 A commentator on 6 December asserted that the Chinese leaders
 sought "the expansion of military action so as to drag new
 countries into the conflict" and said the Chinese "try to
 provoke regional wars anywhere in the world."  Referring to
 the possibility of the expansion of a regional war into a
 large-scale nuclear war, which would "annihilate the peoples
 of all countries, including the Chinese people," the commentary
 took note of Mao Tse-tung's "unabashed statement" that "the
 death of hundreds of millions of the Chinese people in a
 nuclear war would be a healthy blood transfusion."
 PEKING PORTRAYS SOVIET ROLE AS MAIN CAUSE OF TENSION
 The 5 December TASS statement acted as a catalyst which has
 turned Peking's comment on the Indian-Pakistani conflict
 into a withering anti-Soviet campaign.  While Peking previously
 had been using the circumlocution "social imperialism" in
 referring to the Soviets and had directed the rain thrust
 of its attack against India, the 7 December PEOPLE'S DAILY
 Commentator article on the TASS statement accused "Soviet
 revisionist social imperialism" of being the main source
 of the tension in the subcontinent.  Peking has launched a

 The 7 December Commentator article, saying the TASS statement
 "smacks of gunpowder," took sharp exception to the statement's
 assertion "with ulterior motives" o. a Soviet security interest
 in the Indian-Pakistani conflict,  Recalling the Soviet
 invasion of Czechoslovakia and noting that the statement
 cited the proximity of the USSR's borders to the region of
 current tension, Commentator asked the Soviets if they are
 "going :o take action."  The TASS statement represents
 "barefaced blackmail and intiahi.ation," according to Commentator.
 Pursuing a theme developed in the Commentator article on the 6th,
 the article on the 7th claimed that one of the main aims of the
 Soviet-Indian treaty is to support India in "annexing" East
 Pakistan and to gain further control over India in order to
 expand Soviet influence in the subcontinent and the Indian
 Ocean.  But while Peking has thus expressed concern over the
 Soviet role in the region, Chinese pronouncements have not
 defined a threat to the PRC's own security interests or taken
 direct note of the TASS statement's warning against outside
 involvement.

 CHINESE LEADERS     At o 4 December reception given by the
 Mauritanian ambassador, Acting PRC Foreign
 Minister Chi Peng-fei, the only Chinese leader to have discussed
 the Indian-Pakistani conflict since the intensification of
 hostilities on the 3d, charged that the Indian Government,
 "supported and encouraged by social imperialism," had continues
 "to expand its armed aggression against Pakistan."  Noting that
 "an Indian leader"--he did not name Indian Premier Indira
 Gandhi--had made "the truculent detrand for Pakistan troops to
 withdraw from East Pakistan," Chi termed this "a brazen demand"
 which "completely revealed India's expansionist ambitions."
 Chi declared:  "We strongly condemn India for its subversion
 and .ogression and reaffirm that the Chinese Government and
 people firmly support the Pakistan Government and people in
 their just struggle to defend their state sovereignty and
 territorial integrity and oppose foreign aggression."
 Chi's comments on the Indian-Pakistan crisis were excerpted
 by NCNA and carried some four hours prior to NCNA's report
 on the Mauritanian ambassador's reception.  Chi made no
 reference to any implications for Chinese security.  He did
 not elaborate on the existing Chinese commitment--as enunciated
 by Chi himself on 7 November during Ali Bhutto's visit to the
 PRC--that "should Pakistan be subjected to foreign aggression,
 the Chinese Government and people will, as always, ~esolutely

 Chou En-lai, in the undated interview with author. Neville
 Maxwell which appeared in the London SUNDAY TIMES on 5 December,
 noted that Chi on 7 November had "already stated our principles"
 on the Indian-Pakistani issue, adding:  "We firmly support
 Pakistan against India's subversive and aggressive activities."
 Contending that the draft of the Soviet-Indian treaty "had
 lain for two years in a drawer in the Ministry of Foreign
 Affairs of the Soviet Union," Chou asserted that "after the
 announcement of Nixon's visit to China, the Soviet Union
 hastily concluded this treaty with India," a treaty designed
 "to realize Brezhnev's 'Asian collective security system,'
 which is directed against the countries to which Russia is
 hostile."  Chou did not comment on Maxwell's statement that
 "there is a genuine Bengali nationalist movement in East
 Pakistan."  Peking media did not carry the interview.
 BANGLA DESH     In the series of PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator
 articles the Chinese have taken a tough stand
 against the Bengali separatists, overcoming an earlier
 reluctance to discuss the independence movement.  Commentator
 accused India of trying "to inject" the Bangla Desh "puppet
 regime" into Pakistan through "open, direct invasion by
 Indian troops, so as to achieve its long-planned aim to
 annex East Pakistan."  Commentator likened the East Pakistani
 refugee issue to the Tibetan refugee question more than a
 decade ago and described "the 'Bangla Desh' of today" as
 "simply a reproduction of the 'Manchukuo' of the past."
 Consistent with Peking's line over the months, Commentator
 ignored the details of the events in East Pakistan
 precipitating the crisis and reiterated the position that
 internal affairs "should be settled by the people of the
 country themselves" and disputes between countries "should
 be settled through consultations by the countries concerned."
 Asserting that the Chinese government and people "are closely
 following the developments of the situation in the sub-
 continent," Commentatcr called the Pakistani struggle "a
 just one" and said "the Chinese people resolutely support
 the Pakistan Government and people in their struggle to
 defend state sovereignty and territorial integrity and to
 counter foreign aggression."

 SINO-SOVIET POLEMICS MARK SECURITY COUNCIL DEBATE
 The UN Security Council deliberations on the conflict have
 provided a forum for Sino-Soviet skirmishing, s'ith the Chinese
 being especially vitriolic in pressing the attack.  Joining
 issue with the Soviets on the question of inviting a Bangla
 Desh representative to the Security Council session, PRC
 delegate Huang Hua contended that to do so would be "tantamount
 to asking the Security Couucil to interfere directly in the
 internal affairs of Pakistan" and that the Soviet proposal was
 simply an obstructionist and delaying tactic.  Huang called
 the Bangla Desh Government. a "neo-Quisling government, a neo-
 Manchukuo government," and suggested that following India's
 recognition of it the Soviet Government "probably" will also
 "declare its recognition of that 'government' tomorrow or
 the day after tomorrow."  Huang concluded his statement to
 the Security Council on the 6th with this statement:  "I
 wish only to address a few words of-good intention to
 Mr. Malik:  Please bear in mind the fate of 'Manchukuo'
 Quislings and their behind-the-scenes boss!"
 Huong's speech at the 5 December Security Council session
 was particularly vehement toward the Soviets.  Charging
 Moscow with "connivance, support, and shielding" of India's
 armed aggression with the objective "of gaining control over
 the Indo-Pakistan subcontinent and the Indian Ocean and
 enlarging its sphere of influence in its contention with
 the other superpower for hegemony," Huang touched on such
 subjects as a "counterrevolutionary rebellion" engineered
 by the Soviet Union in 1962 in Sinkiang and the subsequent
 forcible detention of "several tens of thousands" of Chinese
 civilians by the Soviet Union; the "so-called Soviet-Indian
 treaty of peace, friendship, and cooperation which is in
 fact a treaty of military alliance;" the 1968 Czechoslovakian
 "occupation;" and the Soviet Government's "plot to subvert
 the legal government of an African country this year."
 Soviet reportage on the Security Council discussions has
 highlighted the Soviet proposal to invite "the representatives
 of.the national liberation movement of East Pakistan (Bangla
 Desh)" to the sessions, charged the United States and China
 with obstructionist tactics, and pressed the Soviet contention
 that UN action must deal with "the fundamental cause" of the
 crisis, which is "the situation created in East Pakistan as
 a result of terrorizing the population of East Pakistan by
 the Pakistani authorities."

 A TASS account an the 6th, which cited the Chinese veto of
 the Soviet resolution "for a political settlement in East
 Pakistan that would inevitably result in cessation of
 hostilities," took note of the Sino-Soviet polemics
 enlivening the Security Council debate.  TASS pointed out
 that the Chinese representative "used his speech for
 slandering the peace-loving policy of the Soviet Union
 and the policy of India" and for launching attacks on "the
 national liberation movement of East Pakistan."  Moscow had
 not until the past few days referred to the separatist
 movement in East Bengal as a "national liberation movement."

 I ND0CHI":A
 COMMUNISTS AS"ESS CAMBODIAN "VICTORIES." ROLE OF BIG BATTLES
 Communist media predictably praise the capture of Cambodian
 Government positions at the towns of Baray and Kompong Thmar--
 on Route 6, north of Phnom Penh.  The official account of the
 action is presented in a communique of "the Route 6 front
 command" of the Cambodian People's National Liberation Armed
 Forces (CNPLAF), dated 2 December but first publicized on
 the 5th.
 The communique claims that the "the CNPLAF and the people"
 have inflicted 12,000 casualties and captured thousands of
 troops in the fighting along Route 6 since the Phnom Penh
 government's operation Chenla 2 began on 20 August.  It also
 maintains that five brigades and more than 30 battalions were
 "seriously mauled" and "huge amounts of war mater-lal" seized.
 In the final four days of fighting, according to the communique,
 more than 3,000 government troops were killed, wounded, or
 captured.  It says that the commanders of the Chenla 2 operation
 "deserted their troops" and that "several other brigade and
 battalion commanders were either mauled or captured."
 The communique acclaims the military achievements on Route 6
 as "the biggest feat-of-arms" of the CNPLAF, but the battle
 is given greater significance in a QUAN DOI NHAN DAN editorial
 and a similar LPA commentary on the 6th.  The QUAN DOI NHAN DAN
 editorial, acclaiming the Route 6 engagements as "strategically
 important" and a "major campaign of annihilation," is at
 variance with a NHAN DAN editorial on the same day which limits
 its praise to references to the CNPLAF's "great victory" and
 "glorious exploit."  The army paper seems quite deliberate in
 its effort to magnify the significance of the CNPLAF's achieve-
 ment, noting that the Cambodian forces were able to launch
 "large-scale attacks involving concentrated forces," that they
 fought "big battles," and that "such major battles of
 annihilation are of very important significance" and have
 "substantially changed the balance of forces of both sides on
 the battlefield."  The victories on Route 6, according to QUAN
 DOI NHAN DAN, "reflect further improvement of the CNPLAF's
 ability to fight big battles involving massive forces."

 It is possible that the army paper merely has more license
 than NHAN DAN to analyze military matters.  But it is also
 possible that QUAN DOI NHAN DAN's stress on the communists'
 ability to fight major engagements reflects an argument with
 more conservative forces represented in MEAN DAN's relatively
 reserved evaluation.
 An earlier QUAN DOI NIIAN DAN editorial, on 4 December, commented
 on "strategic victories" this year to similarly make the point
 that the balance of forces had shifted favorably.  It described
 the allied position as "unstable" in South Vietnam, "highly
 alarming" in Cambodia, and "ver; precarious" in Laos.  Voicing
 what could be viewed as an argument for large-scale attacks,
 the editorial stated that "in the process of war, a period of
 slow development must be followed by a phase of outstanding
 progress."  It went on, however, to state that the armed
 forces and people "must be determined to undergo a protracted
 war."  An article earlier this yea.., published in the January-
 February issue of TUYEN HUAN (PROPAGANDA AND TRAINING), had
 been much more direct in maintaining that protracted warfare
 "is not protracted guerrilla fighting" and that there must
 also be "sudden leap-like developments."*
 Suggesting at another point that it anticipated large-scale
 fighting, the 4 December editorial urged:  "It is necessary
 to constantly heighten the quality of the people's armed forces
 in all fields and to improve their tactical skills so they can
 stage effective, large-scale combined attacks against the
 enemy."  The editorial warned that there would be further
 "difficulties and hardships" and, among other things, specifically
 cautioned that "it is possible that the enemy will embark on
 new military adventures against the North in an attempt to
 intimidate our northern armed forces and people and to prevent
 the vast rearbase from bringing assistance to the great frontline."
 DRV SPOKESMAN SCORES U.S. BOMBING; PRESS EXHORTS AIR FORCE
 The most recent in Hanoi's continuing series of foreign ministry
 spokesman's protests, issued on 6 December, condemns U.S. raids
 against the demilitarized zone (DMZ) and Quang Binh Province
 *  Other Vietnamese communist propaganda on the issue of the
 role of large-scale combat was discussed in the TRENDS of
 20 October 1971, pages 7-9, and 4 August 1971, pages 15-17.

 from 22 November to 5 December.  (Spokesman protests of 8,
 13, 20 and 22 November had protested U.S. action against
 various areas of North Vietnam from 7 to 21 November.)  The
 current protest charges that U.S. planes including B-52's
 conducted "daily ferocious air raids" on Huong Lap village
 in the DMZ, and that during the same period U.S. planes hit
 localities in Quang Binh Province "causing losses in lives
 and property."
 Routinely condemning these "acts of war" and demaLiding that
 the United States end all acts "infringing upon DRV sovereignty
 and security," the spokesman "flatly rej'cted the 'protective
 response' argument so often repeated by the U.S. Administration
 to plead for its piratic acts."  (DRV media, of course, have
 not mentioned recent U.S. press stories and statements by U.S.
 spokesmen on DRV air activity over Laos or the acknowledgment
 that air strikes on 8 November, initially described by U.S.
 spokesmen as falling in the protective reaction category, were
 aimed at an unoccupied North Vietnamese air field.*)
 Recent U.S. statements on increased DRV air defense over Laos
 and North Vietnam this winter come in the wake of notable
 Hanoi propaganda on tasks of antiaircraft troops and the air
 force.  A 20 November QUAN DOI NHAN DAN editorial--just available
 in full translation from the press--urged both the antiaircraft
 troops and the air force co be vigilant and "annihilate the enemy
 when he comes."  It is more usual for Hanoi media to discuss
 vigilance and combat readiness in terms of the requirements
 of the local forces--the militia and self-defense troops.
 However, the major propaganda campaign calling for vigilance
 and combat readiness last fall following the 21 November 1970
 massive U.S. air strikes and the prisoner-rescue attempt at
 Son Tay did, of course, stress antiaircraft and air force
 tasks.
 Hanoi radio on 20 November had broadcast a brief version of
 the editorial in the army paper, but that version emphasized
 the threat of "new U.S. military adventures" and only broadly
 *  The strikes on 7-8 November prompted the usual foreign
 ministry spokesman's statement, rather than the higher level
 foreign ministry statement, but the spokesman did, however,
 call the strikes "particularly serious."  Moreover, atypically
 there was supporting press comment.  See the TRENDS of
 10 November 1971, pages 17-19.

 discussed vigilance.*  The full text of the editorial, however,
 notes that the antiaircraft troops and the air force are "the
 core force to annihilate the enemy, to deutroy all enemy
 air strikes and to insure safety for out forces, positions,
 and routes."  The primary task to successfully fulfill combat
 readiness, says the editorial, is to "constantly train
 ourselves to heighten vigilance and fighting spirit, any time,
 any place--whether close to the demarcation line and border
 or far behind the front, whether there are enemy aircraft
 or not--we must be ready."
 The editorial says antiaircraft and air force units "must
 train intensively to heighten fighting abilities . . . assure
 that enemy aircraft are hit as soon as the antiaircraft units
 open fire and that outstanding exploits are scored once the
 aircraft take off."  It warns that "conservative thinking and
 reluctance to make progress" must be overcome, and it urges
 that "the enemy's law of operation and combat tricks" be
 studied and that "good fighting methods" be invented.  The
 editorial states that each antiaircraft and air force unit,
 "no matter when and where it is stationed and whether it is
 conducting an operation or on the battlefield, must have a
 combat plan to be ready to attack and annihilate the enemy.'
 PRG ANNOUNCES DETAILS OF HOLIDAY CEASE-FIRES IN SOUTH VIETNAM
 Following the pattern set in previous years, Liberation Radio
 on 3 December broadcast a PRG statement and an order from the
 PLAF Command on the suspension of military attacks on the
 occasion of the upcoming holidays.**  The statement and the
 order, both dated the 3d, indicate that, like last year, the
 communists' cease-fires will last for three days at Christmas
 and over the New Year and for four days at the time of Ter
 (the lunar new year).  Providing the details, the PLAF order
 stipulates that all attacks should be suspended for Christmas,
 from zero hour Indochina (Hanoi) time on 24 December to zero
 *   A flurry of comment warned of "new U.S. military adventures"
 at that time.  See the 24 November TRENDS, pages 12-14.

 hour on the 27th; for the New Year, from zero hour on
 31 December to zero hour on 3 January; and for the Nham Ty
 Tet, from zero hour on 14 February to zero hour on 18 February.
 Adhering closely to last year's PLAF order, the present one
 specifies that the allies will be allowed freedom to carry
 out holiday activities and to visit "1iiierated areas" during
 the truces, as long as they do not travel in groups or carry
 weapons or spy equipment.  As in previous years, it warns
 that allied violations of the cease-fires will be "duly
 punished."  The PRG statement and subsequent Front propaganda
 maintain that if the "obdurate, perfidious, and bellicose"
 Nixon Administration would seriously respond to the PRG's
 seven-point proposal the war would end and the allied forces
 could all go home to their families.
 A Liberation Radio commentary on the 7th ridiculed recent
 "vague remarks" by President Thieu about holiday cease-fires,
 commenting that the latest ARVN incursion into Cambodia
 renders meaningless any call for a truce by Thieu.  The radio
 does not specify that Thieu, in a 4 December speech before
 a class of graduating officers, reaffirmed that the Saigon
 government would as usual enact holiday cease-fires, adding
 that he would decide on the times of the truces.

 the Paris talks by PRG deputy delegation head Dinh Ba Thi.*

 the United States "must cease all military acts, including
 those of the air force and navy, against the people in both

 zones of Vietnam."*  And he-explained that point two means that
 the United States "must renounce all support and commitments to
 the bellicose Nguyen Van Thiou clique . . . ."  Both VNA and
 LPA also note that Thi repeated that the seven points form a
 "single entity."
 DRV delegate Xuan Thuy referred only briefly to the seven
 points and did not spell out any of the sub-tance.  Moreover,
 VNA glosses over some of the remarks he dia make.  T19-sus, it
 reports him as saying that the seven-point plan "still offers
 the most correct basis" for peacefully settling the Vietnam
 problem--as opposed to the Nixon Doctrine and Vietna.mizaeion.
 But VNA ignores his further remarks that the PRG deicgate
 "explained how points one and two are inseparable and thi
 delegate of the DRV has also expressed his views."
 VNA neglects to report that the PRG's Thi acknowledged some
 of the substance of the other five points of the 1 July
 proposal, saying that they offered "appropriate solutions"
 also to the questions of the Vietnamese armed forces in South
 Vietnam, ..eaceful reunification, relations between the two
 zones of Vietnam, South Vietnam's external policy of peace
 and neutrality and such "concrete problems" as cease-fire
 and the total release of military men of all parties.  It has
 been more usual in recent months for the Paris delegates to
 mention the substance of only points one and two, if that.
 The VNA account notes, however, that Thi said if the United
 States does respond positively to the proposal "the war will
 be ended, peace will be restored, all U.S. military men including
 those captured will be able to return home soon in safety and a
 new relation will be established between the United States and
 South Vietnam."
 *  This closely parallels the formulation in the joint communique.
 Dong in his 20 November speech had demanded an end "to all
 military acts, in any form and from any place whatsoever, against
 the Vietnamese people in the two zones."  Foreign Minister Nguyen
 Duy Trinh in his 24 October speech during the DPRK delegation's
 visit to Hanoi had referred to an end to "all U.S. air and naval
 activities," and the joint DPRK-DRV communique had specified air
 and naval activities "in South Vietnam."  Subsequent propaganda
 echoed the latter formulation, and it was voiced by PRG delegate
 Nguyen Van Tien at the 4 November Paris session, buz this was not
 reflected in the VNA account.

 VNA ignores much of Thi's lengthy documentation of his complaint
 that the United States has attempted to achieve a "military
 victory" through Vietnamization rather than respond to the PRG
 proposal.  But the account reports that Xuan Thuy took issue
 with the President's statement--in his 12 November press
 conference announcing the withdrawal of 45,000 more troops
 in the next two months--that "Cambodia is the Nixon Doctrine
 in its purest form."  Thuy scored U.S. involvement in Cambodia
 from the March 1970 anti-Sihanouk coup to the recent move of
 more ARVN troops into the country.  Thuy also called
 contradictory the President's "repeated statements that he
 was furthering 'Vietnamization' while negotiating."
 POW ISSUE     The VNA account of the session totally ignores
 the substance of Ambassador Porter's remarks;
 in which, among other things, he again questioned the decreasing
 volume of mail from U.S. POW's in the DRV.  VNA says only that
 the U.S. delegate "remained very stubborn and again resorted
 to odious provocative allegations."
 The 7 December Liberation Radio commentary on implementation of
 the PRG's call for holiday cease-fires labeled as "hypocritical"
 both Thieu's remarks on a cease-fire and the "U.S. Paris
 delegate's plea" that POW's be allowed to send letters to
 their families.  It asked whether the U.S. claim that it is
 concerned "about the U.S. troops' feelings regarding Christmas"
 has any meaning when it has "stubbornly rejected" the PRG's
 seven-point initiative.
 The prisoner issue was also raised in a "current events" talk
 broadcast by Hanoi radio in Mandarin on 2 December.  Pressing
 the standard line that the way to allow the prisoners to rejoin
 their families is to accept the 774 proposal, the broadcast
 deprecated the President's remark in his 12 November press
 conference that further U.S. withdrawal from South Vietnam
 would depend, among other things, on progress in the problem
 of releasing U.S. prisoners of war.  It suggested that the
 President sees the Christmas season as an opportunity to placate
 public opinion and pave the way for next year's elections.

 that an agreement on "mutual supply of goods and payments for
 1972" and two protocols on China's supplying of "general goods"
 and "complete projects" in 1972 were signed.  According to the
 reports, the protocols were in accordance with the 27 September
 Sino-DRV agreement on economic and military assistance.  The
 signators were, as usual, PRC Vice Minister of Foreign Trade
 Li Chiang and his DRV counterpart, Ly Ban.  PRC Vice Premier
 Li Hsien-nien attended the ceremony, as he did last year, and
 members of a DRV "experts delegation" were present.  An
 "experts delegation," led by Ly Ban, had arrived in Peking
 on 28 August.  Ly Ban had returned to Hanoi to participate
 in the talks during Li Hsien-nien's visit when the aid
 agreement was signed, and he was again present in Pekiag
 when the Pham Van Dong delegation visited from 20 to 27
 November.
 The signing of a trade agreement some time after the annual
 PRC-DRV aid agreement has been standard practice, but last

 also been publicized.*  The accords last year, signed on

 between the two governments, dealing with Chinese supply to
 the DRV of materials, aid in the form of "complete projects,"
 and the living standard and working conditions of Chinese
 technical personnel sent to Vietnam.  A protocol on Chinese
 delivery to the DRV of equipment and materials for "complete
 projects" was also concluded between the PRC Commission for
 Economic Relations with Foreign Countries and the DRV Ministry
 of Foreign Trade.  The same individuals, Li Chiang and Ly Ban,
 signed all the agreements.
 There is no report this time of a protocol regarding Chinese
 technicians, but they continue to receive publicity in other
 propaganda.  For example, aid personnel were reported as being
 present at activities during the visits to North Vietnam of
 Li Hsien-nien in September and Chou En-lai in March.

 PRAVDA ARTICLE DISSECTS MAOISM. NOTES LIN PIAO'S FALL
 Moscow has provided its most comprehensive analysis of the China
 problem since the recent Peking leadership reshuffle.  A lengthy
 theoretical disquisition in PRAVDA on 5 December by leading
 academician P. Fedoseyev carries forward the Soviet ideological
 offensive against Peking's flexible policies by taking account
 of the purge of Lin Piao and other important figures in the
 Chinese military hierarchy.  While taking a notably sanguine
 view of the prospects of anti-Maoist forces in China in the
 long term, the article's basic message is that the communist
 movement under Moscow's aegis must sustain its ideological attack
 designed to discredit the Maoist leadership and to check Peking's
 growing influence in world affairs.
 The use of the theoretical approach in providing an account of
 the Chinese purge reflects the sensitivity of the subject,
 which Moscow has handled cautiously since tell-tale anomalies
 began appearing in the PRC.  It is also in keeping with the
 use of quasischolarly methods for conducting Moscow's
 ideological campaign against the Chinese.  On 1 December
 Moscow reported that a conference on Soviet Sinology ending
 that day had noted the "importance of the tasks of unmasking
 the anti-Marxist essence of Maoism."  Previously, PRAVDA on
 14 November announced that a new quarterly on "Problems of
 the Far East" would be started next year to deal with Soviet
 policy in that area.
 The Fedoseyev article ends with the claim that "exposure of
 the anti-Leninist chauvinistic ideology and policy of
 Maoism is seen by genuine Marxist-Leninists as an
 indispensable condition" for strengthening communist unity.
 Citing the 24th CPSU Congress' line on Sino-Soviet relations,
 Fedoseyev observes that Moscow's effort to normalize state
 relations with the PRC "is also served by the ideological-
 political struggle against 'left' revisionism."
 CRITIQUE OF     Fedoseyev's article, "On the Ideological-
 PURE MAOISM                                 Political Essence of Maoism," pursues its
 task with an intransigence that consigns Mao
 beyond even the bounds of d~viationism.  It is impossible,
 according to Fedoseyev, to accommodate the Maoist interpretation

 of Marxism-Leninism within the framework of "a dogmatic-
 sectarian, 'leftist' interpretation."  Worse than that,
 "Maoism is Sinicized social chauvinism of which Chinese social
 militarism constitutes the nucleus"--a charge contrived to
 turn back on Peking the type of labels it pins on the Soviets
 for practicing "social imperialism" and "social fascism.`
 Fedoseyev dismisses Maoist doctrine as an eclectic farrago
 of views, theories, and concepts in which great-power
 nationalism is the underlying motif.  The use of whatever
 serves nationalistic and "great-Han chauvinist purposes''
 demonstrates "the narrowly utilitarian and pragmatic nature`:
 of the theory and practice of Maoism, according to Fedoseyev's
 analysis.  Though his argument is developed mainly on the
 theoretical plane, this line of analysis serves Moscow's
 purpose of discreu{.ting the more flexible policies Peking has
 been pursuing, such. ae its invitation to President Nixon.
 Thus, in an allusion to this flexibility, Fedoseyev charges
 that the Maoists advance those tenets which serve their
 utilitarian needs at a given historical stage without con;:ern
 for logic and continuity.  In another passage, alluding to
 Peking's use of the theory of contradictions to justify new
 approaches to the United States as a means of isolating the
 Soviet Union as the main enemy, he claims teat the Maoists
 posit relations of unity or struggle depending on whatever
 serves their great-power aims.
 Fedoseyev does single  out one issue, Indochina, in presenting
 his theoretical indictment.  He charges that "Mao's group"
 hinders unity of action on Indochina, "in essence" pursuing
 "a policy of compromise with the imperialist forces on an
 anti-Soviet basis."  Ile also complains that the Maoists are
 creating an atmosphere of war hysteria in China.
 CHINESE PURGE     The Fedoseyev article is notable for its
 account of the recent Chinese leadership
 upheaval, which may in fact be the occasion for this
 theoretical exercise.  According to Fedoseyev, the role of a
 gendarmerie given to the People's Liberation Army in the
 cultural revolution led to ferment within the army and to
 disaffection toward Mao.  The army thus became ''a dangerous
 hotbed of anti Maoist feelings," and for this reason "the
 Maoists at present are conducting purges" aimed at
 "mercilessly nipping in the very bud the anti-Maoist movement"
 in the PLA.

 In taking brief note of Lin Piao's disappeara?ie--he "no longer
 figures as Mao's successor"--Fedoseyev recalls that the PTA had
 been prepared before the cultural revolution for the major
 role it was to play in that upheaval.  It had been Lin, in fact,
 who was in charge of fashioning the army into an instrument
 serving Mao's political purposes.  Fedoseyev explains that
 having completed the cultural revolution, in which the PLA
 played a decisive part, Mao then turned on the military
 leadership.  "The meaning of this maneuver is obvious,"
 Fedoseyev points out cryptically.
 Fedoseyev's caution is characteristic of Moscow's reaction to
 thr Chinese leadership reshuffle.  Instead of coming to terms
 directly with the issues and implications, Moscow has had
 recourse to foreign comment for assessments of the significance
 of recent developments in China.  Thus, LITERARY GAZETTE on
 1 December carried excerpts from an Italian article on Lin
 Piao's disgrace which traces the conflict between Mao and Lin
 to questions involving foreign policy, mainly relations with
 the United States and the Soviet Union, resources allocated to
 the army, and the army's role in running the country.
 "GENUINE" COMMUNISTS     Fedoseyev's article concludes with a
 relatively confident portrayal of the
 strength of anti-Maoist forces in China and of the effects of
 pressure from the international communist movement.  While
 acknowledging that Mao's "great-power chauvinist group" is
 maintaining its control in Peking, Fedoseyev claims that
 "powerful social, political, and sociological forces" within
 China and abroad are working to defend the country's
 socialist achievements and to restore Marxism-Leninism and
 proletarian internationalism.  The "genuine" communists in
 China have suffered a temporary reversal, Fedoseyev notes,
 "but they have not laid down their arms."
 The invocation of the "genuine" communists opposing Maoism
 has been a recurrent theme in Moscow's ideological campaign
 for the past five years.  It serves, among other things, to
 legitimize Moscow's effort to mobilize collective pressure
 within the communist movement against the anathematized
 Maoist faction.  Thus, Fedoseyev claims that Mocow's "principled
 Leninist policy" and the international communist movement are
 influencing developments in China, citing in this connection the
 "condemnation of Maoism" at the June 1969 world party conference
 and at congresses of the fraternal parties.  These pressures
 "cannot fail to take effect on the situation in China," he asserts.

 ANTI-CHINESE ATTACKS    The current Polish party congress, which

 ARTICLE ON "PRAIRIE FIRE" LETTER SEEMS DIRECTED AT LIN
 An article in RED FLAG No. 13, authored by the Yunnan Provincial
 CCP Committee, examines the "revolutionary truth" of one of Mao's
 most renowned works, "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire."
 The title alone, all that is available so far, suffices to
 indicate that the current drive against "political swindlers"
 is being directed more explicitly against Lin Piao.
 The piece by Mao, written in January 1930, Teas published in early
 collections of his works under the title, "Letter to Comrade Lin
 Piao."  In the letter, Mao warned Lin against the danger of
 defeatism and instructed him that, although the outlook at the
 time appeared bleak, disunity among its enemies would result in
 victory for the CCP.  The title was presumably altered in order
 to save Lin from embarrassment, and the editor of Mao's "Selected
 Works" notes simply that the piece "was a letter written by" Mao
 "in criticism of certain pessimistic views then existing in the
 party."  The letter, somewhat avuncular in tone, was frequent.LJ
 cited during the cultural revolution, often--or so it seemed--
 as an implicit example of the longterm teacher-student
 relationship between Mao and Lin.
 A recent broadcast by the Shensi provincial radio, referring
 to the "Prairie Fire" article, suggests that it is to be part
 of the indictment against Lin, evidence that his unreliability
 extends back some 40 years.  The 27 November broadcast reported
 that a PLA company had read "Prairie Fire" in the course of a
 study of the history of the civil war.  All members of the unit,
 it was said, noted that just as the revolution met with temporary
 difficulties "a number of opportunists in the party spread
 certain pessimistic ideas . . . in a vain attempt to weaken
 party morale and slow down the revolution."  "Precisely at this
 moment," the broadcast observed, Mao countered the attack by
 writing "Prairie Fire."
 "BOURGEOIS MILITARY LINE" PUSHED BY "SWINDLERS" IS ATTACKED
 Some lessening of the PLA's direct control over local administrative
 work--possibly one of the issues involved in the struggle in which
 Lin Piao fell--is seen in recent press articles which stress the
 need for the army to lay more attention to improvement of military
 skills.  Such a stress departs sharply from the norms of the

 cultural revolution, when propagandists singled out the PLA's
 role in revolution and production and appeared to assume that
 military affairs could take care of themselves.  While
 complete withdrawal of the PLA from its civilian tasks is
 certainly not being suggested now, the injunctions to
 increase attention to military skills would seem to load
 inevitably to a lowered attention to politics.  Also, along
 with the calls for greater attention to military skills, there
 are indications that PLA influence on party committees and
 revolutionary committees is being eroded through injunctions
 to follow "unified leadership" rather than allow dominance
 by the (usually military) leading members of the committees.
 Radio Peking on 3 December told how a PLA unit within the
 Shenyang Military Region had "correctly" handled the relationship
 between politics and military affairs.  The report noted that
 while "politics must be put in command of military affairs . . .
 it cannot be substituted for m:litary affairs."  It was
 specifically argued that "giving prominence to politics
 does not mean that it is no longer necessary to solve many
 concrete problems in military training."  Recalling the
 historical lesson to be learned from Lo Jui-ching's mistaken
 attempt to ignore politics and concentrate only on military
 development, the report declared that criticism of "the purely
 military viewpoint" is "not aimed at opposing military
 training."  It was forcefully asserted that "the fallacy of
 totally separating military affairs from politics runs
 counter to Chairman Mao's line cn army building."
 The report then described in some detail how a gun captain
 within the unit who once "overemphasized politics without
 being realistic in target practice" had overcome this
 shortcoming and learned to handle correctly the relationship
 between politics and military affairs.  After studying.past
 attempts to "undermine Chairman Mao's line on army building
 from the extreme left," he "realized that to carry out
 ideological-political work without being realistic is also
 incompatible with Chairman Mao's line on army building."
 With this deepened understanding of the relationship between
 politics and military affairs, he was able to do a "good
 job in carrying out ideological-political work" and also in
 "arousing the enthusiasm of the comrades for mastering
 military skills."

 The same theme was utilized in P. 22 November 11ofei radio report
 :.r the ideological progress of me^ibers of the party committee
 of model PLA unit 6408--which is commanded by Li Te-sheng,
 Anhwei's first party secretary and an alternate politburo
 member, who has been making regular appearances in Peking
 in his post as chief of the General Political Department.
 While studying ways to strengthen his ability to "distinguish
 between genuine and sham Marxism," one of the party committee
 members discovered that because of the "bourgeois military
 line" promoted by Liu Shao-chi and "other political swindlers . . .
 some comrades were afraid to go all-out in grasping military
 affairs."  After intensifying their study of works by Marx,
 Lenin and Mao, other members of the party committee were soon
 able to "see clearly the new form of struggle between the two
 different military lines under the new situation and to under-
 stand the unity between politics and military affairs."  This
 understanding helped overcome the "erroneous idea of being
 afraid to grasp military affairs" and thus "set in motion
 military training and further stimulated political work."
 A Chengtu press article on 16 November recalled that while
 "sham Marxist political swindlers like Liu Shao-chi" negated
 the commanding role of politics over military affairs from
 the right by advocating "big contests of arms" they also
 appeared later with "ultraleftist features and pursued empty
 politics divorced from reality, setting politics and military
 affairs against each other."  The article urged emulation of
 the example of Lu Hsun, who discovered "in good time and
 mercilessly exposed sham Marxism of all hues," in order to
 obtain a "good grasp of genuine Marxism" to help in "seeing
 through and smashing" those enemies who "disguise themselves
 as Marxists."
 The need to find the proper balance between military work
 and political studies was discussed in some detail in an
 article by a PLA unit in Harbin broadcast by the Heilungkiang
 provincial radio on 6 November.  The article criticized
 those within the unit who learned military skills but
 neglected political studies as well as those who paid "great
 attention to political studies and maintained that military
 skills might be learned gradually later."  It was firmly
 warned that if this went unchecked "military skills, no
 matter how good, could not serve their proper purposes and
 political studies would be divorced from reality."

 After conducting education on Mao's line on army building,
 members of this unit were able to criticize and struggle
 against the "bourgeois military line" pushed by Liu Shao-chi
 anu "other political swindlers."  It was claimed that deeper
 ideological work produced the realization that "substituting
 politics for military affairs, or divorcing military affairs
 from politics, is merely the reflection of the bourgeois
 military line."  With this new understanding the commander
 of the unit was able to overcome his fear that "by grasping
 military training, he would be labeled as having purely
 military concepts," and he found it possible to "draw a
 clear line of demarcation between grasping training well for
 preparedness against war through putting politics in command,
 and grasping military training alone."
 COLLECTIVE    Those PLA leaders who hold leading positions on
 DECISIONS     local revolutionary and party committees are now
 under specific instructions to strengthen their
 own party concept and to listen obediently to the collective
 decisions of committee members.  This thesis was argued in
 some detail by Radio Peking on 3 December in a report on the
 activities of Chin Ko-min, a secretary of the Yutien county
 party committee in Hopei who is also head of the county's
 armed forces department.  The report stated that because of
 Chin's efforts to carry out Mao's "revolutionary line while
 doing 'three supports and two militaries' tasks" during the
 cultural revolution "he was elected chairman of the county's
 revolutionary committee, and when the .;ounty's party committee
 was formed he was elected secretary of the committee."
 Immediately following the formation of the new party committee,
 however, veteran party members, "afraid they might make
 mistakes" in carrying out their work assignments, would do
 their work "only after getting the nod from Chin."  Young
 cadres with poor concepts of the party's organization "came
 to Chin for consultations on the matters handled by them
 more often than they went to report the matters to the
 county's party committee."
 Chin, aware of the need to be "modest and seek opinions" from
 others, held that as secretary of the party committee "he
 must place himself within the commitree and not outside it,
 still less above it, so that the centralized leadership of
 the party would not be weakened."  He also recalled that
 the fact that other committee members sought advice from
 him instead of participating in collective leadership "was
 an expression of their poor party concept."

 Chin attempted to correct those shortcomings by performing
 exemplary actions which manifested his own party spirit.  On
 one occasion, for example, the standing committee had adopted
 a resolution presented by him on using the county's working
 capital to purchase production equipment for the county's
 industries.  Some members of the party committee, however,
 opposed the resolution when the budget was submitted to the
 plenary session of the committee.  Chin then "immediately
 withdrew the proposal"; another resolution "calling for self-
 reliance was adopted, and the production equipment was
 produced by the county itself."
 PEKING POPULARIZES NEW 1YPE OF NEIGHBORHOOD STORE
 An innovation on the commercial front is indicated in a recent
 Radio Peking broadcast that tells of an experiment with small
 neighborhood stores in a district of Peking.  The 5 December
 report explains that neighborhoods and factories are being
 allowed to buy goods from the state commercial department and
 sell them in neighborhood and factory canteens.  It is said
 the system results not only in more convenient service to the
 people but in savings for the state as well.  The broadcast
 article outlines the system in such detail that it appears to
 be offering the experimental stores as a national model.
 The procedures for the neighborhood canteens include a number
 of safeguards to forestall any .:esurgen..e of smallscale
 capitalism.  Nonetheless, the very existence of such stores,
 providing a buffer between the purchaser and the .:tare?
 constitutes a retreat from the purer forms of communism.
 The rationale for the stores is that the state commercial
 network has been unable to keep up with the needs of the
 district, whore population has rapidly increased; some
 found it necessary to walk a mile to buy basic necessities
 such as food, thread, and cigarettes.  This was not only
 inconvenient, especially for people who worked during the
 hours stores were open, but there are also hthts that it
 may have interfered with factory production, causing some
 factories to set up small shops on their own.
 From this beginning, the decision was made to let factories
 and neighborhoods set up stores using their own personnel and
 equipment.  The article notes that it was done over the
 objections of some workers in commerce.

 The report specifies taut the stores should not be envisioned
 as a retreat to the cooperative store or to a practice of
 letting the neighborhoods run state commerce.       Commercial
 departments will exercise business controls and are to make
 sure that the neighborhoods "adhere to the state unified
 price policy"; goods in the canteens are not to cost more
 than elsewhere.  The neighborhoods will in theory only manage
 the canteens under state guidance, and will arrange for the
 commissions paid the store for selling goods to be correctly
 distributed among those working in the store.  As a further
 safeguard, the stores are prohibited from selling any items
 noc procured from the state, from bartering, or from credit
 transactions.  They cannot even shop around for better state
 prices, but must buy at nearby sta.e stores at retail prices.
 Yet there is an incentive for the canteen employeesto sell
 more goods, an incentive not offered state employees.
 Commissions paid to t1w- store (and thus to the employees)
 increase as the volume grows; furthermore, the article
 specifies that the percentage of commission paid will vary
 with the volume of sales.
 The new system of neighborhood canteens offers several clear
 economic advantages to the state, and loopholes which would
 allow bourgeois deviations are at least legally closed.  The
 state saves the capital expense of L,ilding large stores,
 and it saves on salaries paid from government funds; it
 wins popular favor, and it probably sells more goods, not
 only because the stores are more convenient but because
 the salespeople have an incentive to sell more.

 EUROPEAN SECURITY
 PACT COMNUNIQUEo SOVIET LEADERS PRESS CONFERENCE PROPOSAL
 Soviet bloc pressures for the convening of a European security
 conference were sustained with the release on 2 December of
 the communique on the meeting of the Warsaw Pact foreign
 ministers in Warsaw.  The communique on the 30 November-
 1 December meeting--like the communique on the last Warsaw
 Pact foreign minister:,' meeting in Bucharest in February--
 endorses the November 1970 Finnish proposal for the opening
 of multila..eral preparatory consultations among all states
 concerned and announc s that the Pact governments have
 decides; to appoint plenipotentiaries to take part in
 preparatory meetings.  The communique says that such meetings
 should consider, among other things, the agenda of an all-
 European conference.
 Listing the steps contributing to an easing of tension in
 Europe, the communique c.tes the four-power accord on Berlin
 and the "deepening of political cooperation" between the USSR
 and France.  Additionally, it points to 1972 as the year in
 which the convening of a conference is possible, a line that
 has appeared frequently in propaganda since Brezhnev's October
 visit to France.  Both Brezhnev in Warsaw, in his 7 December
 speech at the Polish party congress, and Kosygin during his
 visits to Denmark and Norway have raised the possibility of
 holding the conference next year.  Speaking in Copenhagen on
 the 3d, Kosygin said a conference could be held in 1972 "if
 no obstacles are raised artifically"; in the same speech, he
 cited the 1 December Pact communique on readiness to appoint
 plenipotentiaries to take part in preparatory meetings.
 The communique appeals; to the governments of all European
 states, as well as to those of the United States and
 Canada, to begin preparations for a conference in order
 to insure its convocation in 1972.  While the February
 communique did not name the United States and Canada, the
 memorandum following a Pact fore.'^n ministers' meeting in
 June 1970 had formalized the bid to both countries, and
 subsequent propaganda has regularly included Washington and
 Ottawa among the likely participants.

 KOSYGIN HINTS TROOP REDUCTION COULD BE ON CONFERENCE AGENDA
 The 2 December Pact communique failed to mention the Brezhnev
 proposal--surfaced in his 31 March 1971 report to the CPSU
 Congress--for the opening of talks on force and armaments
 reductions in central Europc'.  But Kosygin in his 3 December
 speech in Copenhagen intimated that the force-reduction
 proposal might be discussed at a European security conference.
 As reported by TASS, he noted Soviet interest in seeing the
 governments of all European states exerting their efforts at
 ensuring lasting security in Europe, "at reductions of armed
 forces and armaments," at disarmament, and at pursuing a
 policy of peace; he concluded that it is "particularly these
 questions" that the USSR and its allies hope to solve at a
 European security conference.  AFP cited Kosygin as telling
 newsmen in Oslo on the 7th that if the European security
 conference were held soon, "problems surrounding the mutual
 and balanced force reduction question could be incorporated
 into the meeting."* The TASS account of this press conference,
 while noting Kosygin's endorsement of a European security
 conference, did not broach the force-reduction issue.
 Brezhncev in Warsaw mentioned the force-reduction proposal
 only in passing, observing that a radical improvement in
 the political climate in Europe   and a solution of "all-
 European problems, including a cut in armed forces and
 armaments, would correspond to the interests of all mankind."
 Both the 5 December Soviet-Danish and 7 December Soviet-
 Norwegian communiques note the importance of achieving
 practical results on the problem of mutual reduction of
 armed forces and armaments in Europe "where the military
 confrontation is particularly dangerous," adding that
 reductions must be made without detriment to the interests
 of participating states.  This formulation, which first

 foreign ministers in Budapest had proposed that a European
 security conference discuss as an agenda item "the establishment
 of a body concerned with questions of European security and
 cooperation."  It added that in the Pact members' view, it
 would help to promote security in Europe if the reduction of
 "foreign" armed forces on the territory of European states
 were discussed, either in the newly proposed permanent body
 "or in other ways acceptable to the states concerned."

 8 DECEMBER 1971
 GDR BLAMES WEST FOR DELAY IN SIGNING OF INNER-GERMAN ACCORDS
 The East Berlin press, radio, television, and ADN launched a bitter
 propaganda barrage on 4 December accusing the West in general and
 the West Berlin Senat and Governing Mayor Schuetz in particular of
 "torpedoing" plans for ceremonies that day to initial draft accords
 worked out in the inner-German phase of negotiations following the
 3 September Big Four agreement on Berlin.  Noting that the negotia-
 tions between FRG and GDR State Secretaries Bahr and Kohl on an
 East-West German transit agreement were "successfully" completed
 on the 3d, East Berlin media have professed "incredulity" over FRG
 willingness to permit a linkage between the Bahr-Kohl talks and
 the stalled negotiations between Senat representative Mueller and
 GDR State Secretary Kohrt on travel and visits by West Berliners
 to the GDR and on the question of enclaves.
 East Berlin's comment has been at pains to underscore the GDR's
 "accommodating attitude" in botli.sets of talks, against the
 background of evident Soviet pressures for their conclusion in
 November--prior to the 9-10 December NATO Council session, in
 light of. NATO's position that the Berlin problem should be
 solved before the West can move ahead to consideration of a
 conference on European security and cooperation.
 Buttressing the insistent portrayal of GDR good will and anxiety
 for completion of the inn'-,r-German phase, East Berlin media dis-
 closed on the 4th that the GDR had offered a "special concession"
 if the agreements had been, initialed that day.  According to
 NEUES DEUTSCHLAND on the 5th, West Berliners would have been
 able to visit East Berlin and "other areas of the GDR" during
 the coming Christmas holidays for the first time since 1966.
 Other GDR media emphasized that this would have been allowed
 even if the final protocol putting the Berlin agreement into
 effect had not yet been signed by the Big Four.  (Chancellor
 Brandt confirmed the GDR's Christmas-visits offer on the 8th.)
 NEUES DEUTSCHLAND declared on the 6th that the GDR was still
 "prepared to initial the agreements without delay." Ignoring
 the Senat's call for further discussion on remaining differences
 in the Muller-Kohrt talks, ADN reported of  the 7th that State
 Secretary Peter Florin would replace Kohrt--who had "fallen ill
 and has to undergo hospital treatment"--to conduct talks with
 the Senat "for the final preparation of the initialing of the

 agreements."  ADN reported the upshot of the Florin-Kohrt meet-
 ing, which materialized in the early hours of 8 December, In an
 announcement later that day that "the talks showed again that
 there is complete agreement between the two sides" on the two
 agreements under negotiation but that the Senat representative
 "again was not ready or authorized to initial these documents."
 Ignoring the West German charges made public earlier in the day
 that the GDR Government had repudiated its own representative's
 tentative agreement to a resolution of the remaining differences,
 ADN claimed that the Senat representative "raised further
 unacceptable demands which he wanted inserted in minutes already
 agreed on."  The ADN report concluded with the stock assurance
 that the East German side affirmed its readiness to sign both
 agreements "without delay,"
 NOVEMBER DEADLINE     The mounting Soviet pressures on the East
 Germans to wind up the negotiations had
 come sharply into focus in East German and Soviet media during
 Brezhnev's brief stopover in East Berlin on 31 October-1 November
 en route home from France.  Although both he and Honecker
 referred in luncheon speeches to "full unanimity" of views;
 the joint communique on the visit included no such formula.
 It did state that Honecker informed Brezhnev about the "progress"
 of the inner-German talks and that Brezhnev "expressed support
 for the businesslike and constructive position" of the GDR and
 for GDR "efforts directed at the quickest possible conclusion" of
 the talks--something less than unqualified Soviet approbation.
 Honecker had said in his luncheon speech that the GDR was doing
 everything possible to reach a "positive conclusion" as soon as
 possible.
 Four days later, in a speech at a reception marking the October
 Revolution anniversary, Honecker specified that the GDR was
 "interested in concluding the negotiations . . . in November
 if possible.'  And the GDR's "interest" in a November conclusion
 was reiterated by NEUES DEUTSCHLAND Chief Editor Herrmann in an
 article in PRAVDA on 16 November, as well as by Foreign Minister
 Winzer in a speech at a diplomatic dinner in East Berlin on the
 17th.  The intensity of the Soviet pressures behind these avowals
 was brought into sharp relief the next day when PRAVDA political
 commentator Zhukov misquoted Honecker.  According to Zhukov, Honecker's
 statement that "the current talks among the GDR, the FRG, and
 the West Berlin Senat can and must be successfully concluded
 this November st_'l1 further intensified hopes for the construc-
 tive development of events in Europe."

 8 DECEMBER 1971
 On the 19th, the East Germans further escalated their assurances
 that they were making all-out efforts to conclude the talks,
 while attempting to shift the onus for the delays to the West.
 The SED Politburo report to the Central Committee plenum that
 day stated that the GDR has "repeatedly stressed" that it was
 "ready to make concessions" in the talks in the interests of
 European peace and security, adding that the FRG and the Senat
 must be "equally willing to show realism" if the talks were to
 succeed.
 As the momentum increased in the inner-German talks in the latter
 half of November, Winzer stated in a Dresden speech on the 25th
 that the GDR was "showing an accommodation to achieve an understand-
 ing" in the talks with the FRG within the limits of the GDR's
 sovereign rights.  The CPSU Central Committee plenum resolution
 on the party's international activity, released by TASS on
 23 November, glaringly omitted any reference to the Berlin
 agreement in listing European developments.  However, the "West
 Berlin" agreement was duly cited as one of the "milestones"
 leading to an improved European political situation in the
 2 December communique of the Warsaw Pact foreign ministers'
 meeting.  The communique also said that the ministers expressed
 "satisfaction" at the GDR stand contributing to a "successful
 course" in the talks.  The 30 November communique on FRG Foreign
 Minister Scheel's visit to the USSR and the communiques on
 Kosygin's visits to Denmark and Norway, issued on 5 and 7 December
 respectively, routinely expressed hope that the talks would be
 concluded shortly.
 With the November deadline imminent, the GDR Government's
 programmatic statement read by Premier Stoph on the 29th again
 conveyed the sense of urgency about winding up the talks.
 Noting that the talks "recently advanced a good deal," Stoph
 said "it is necessary and possible to conclude them soon; this
 requires that all parties proceed constructively to solve
 related questions."
 In his speech to the Polish party congress on 7 December,
 Brezhnev limited his remarks on the subject to the statement
 that the "working out of an agreement between the GDR and the
 FRG and the West Berlin Senat on questions relating to" West
 Berlin, along with the Moscow and Warsaw treaties with Bonn,
 GDR and FRG membership in the United Nations, and a settlement
 of problems between Prague and Bonn, "will bring the postwar
 period of European development to an end."  Brezhnev left it
 to Polish leader Gierek to state that ratification of the

 Moscow and Warsaw treaties "will also facilitate the effective
 implementation of the important agreement of the Four powers on
 West Berlin"; at the elite level, Moscow has scrupulously avoided
 suggesting this "reverse linkage," the  notion'that the treaties
 must be ratified before the final Berlin protocol can be signed,
 turning around Bonn's insistence that signing of the paotocol is
 a precondition for ratification.
 WVTIENTARIES RELEASE DETAILS OF SENAT-GDR AGREEMENTS
 The SED Politburo announced on the evening of 3 December that it
 "fully and entirely" approved reports by Kohl and Kohrt "on the
 conclusion" of their respective negotiations and recommended to
 the GDR Council of Ministers that both be authorized to initial
 the respective agreements.  Referring on the 4th to the "success-
 fully" concluded Bahr-Kohl agreement, the media divulged no
 details.  But details on two prospective Senat-GDR accords,
 still held up in the Mueller-Kohrt negotiations, were made public
 for the first time in GDR media in the course of the concerted
 propaganda assault on West Berlin Mayor Schuetz for allegedly
 undermining plans to get all the agreements initialed that day.
 ADN on the 4th for the first time reported the titles of the two
 prospective Senat-GDR agreements--on "Alleviations and Improve-
 ments in Travel and Visits" and "The Settlement of the Question
 of Enclaves by Territorial Exchanges."  NEUES DEUTSCHLAND the
 next day discussed in detail the visit and travel provisions of
 the first agreement, without acknowledging the two outstanding
 Senat demands that visits be allowed 365 days a year on demand
 and that they be made by private car if desired.  On the 6th the
 paper took note of these demands and rejected them.
 Rebutting Schuetz' statement to the effect that he considered
 the Mueller-Kohrt agreements "unacceptable," the SED paper on
 the 5th revealed the following allegedly agreed provisions of
 the travel accord, with a prefatory "as we have learned":
 West Berliners could receive permission to visit once ~.ir
 several times a year, for an annual total of 30 days, "the
 GDR capital" and all of the GDR for purposes based on "humani-
 tarian, family, religious, cultural, and tourist grounds."  A
 personal identification document and GDR entry and exit permits
 would be required, and the latter two could be obtained on
 application to the authorized bodies.  West Berliners, the
 paper said, could receive entry permits at the border crossing
 points but must produce vouchers or telegrams confirmed by

 competent GDR organs.  Thus the GDR version contained no pro-
 cedure for possible immediate entry on demand, which Schuetz
 in a statement on the 6th had maintained should flow from the
 four-power agreement's stipulation that West Berliners should
 be allowed to travel to East Berlin on the same basis as West
 Germans.
 The next day, in coming directly to grips with Schuetz' "absurd"
 demands "that West Berliners be guaranteed entry permission--by
 car--on all 365 drys on the year," NEUES DEUTSCHLAND argued that
 there is not "a single word" about 365 days or about "promised
 entry by car" in the four-power agreement.  Maintaining that the
 GDR as a "sovereign state" decides the mode of entry into its
 territory, "in what way, for how long, and     often," the paper
 remarked caustically that for a stay of 30 days West Berliners
 can use the railroads, aircraft, subways, streetcars, taxis, and
 other means of ;transport--"they should suffice to get West
 Berliners into the GDR."
 Regarding the agreement on enclaves, the paper specified on the
 5th that West Berlin would receive "a link, belonging to West
 Berlin, between Steinstuecken and West Berlin" and that an
 exchange of other parcels of territory between West Berlin and
 the GDR was to take place.

 IMPACT OF DECEMBER EVENTS PERVADES OPENING SPEECHES
 Following First Secretary Gierek's opening report to the Sixth
 Polish United Workers Party (PZPR) Congress on 6 December, which
 spelled out an elaborate program to remedy the "bitter" experiences
 of December 1970, Brezhnev the next day endorsed Gierek's
 corrective efforts and conveyed a veiled warning that orthodox
 principles must continue to be observed.  The 70 foreign party
 delegations to'the congress include all the Warsaw Pact country
 first secretaries--including Romania's Ceausescu, who had sent
 lower-ranking figures to the Bulgarian, Czechoslovak, and East
 German party congresses this year after attending the CPSU
 congress in April.  Attendance at the congress of the softer-
 lining Polish party provides Ceausescu with a convenient means
 to counteract the impression of Rc-nania's growing isolation
 within the Warsaw Pact.
 BREZHNEV SPEECH     Attending his fourth East European party
 congress this year, Brezhnev used language
 reminiscent of his remarks at the May CPCZ congress, with
 reference to the Czechoslovak 1968 events, when he invoked
 "historical experience" in noting that "individual omissions
 and mistakes, sometimes serious ones, are not ruled out in
 the great work of socialia- construction."  He added:  "But
 what is important is that they stem not from the nature of
 socialism as a social system" and its basic principles but
 occur "when there is some departure from these principles,
 some violation of them."  In this connection, the Soviet
 leader warned that "we communists are answerabl:: for the
 destinies of our country, for a correct course of socialist
 development."
 Brezhnev registered generally low-keyed approval of the Gierek
 regime's reform measures, which are mainly concerned with a
 greater voice for the workers in party decision-making and a
 better lot for the consumer:  "We respect the principled and
 courageous approach of the P-alish United Workers Party to
 correcting negative developments that have taken place."  He
 noted further "a great and sincere concern for the interests
 of the working people, for a constant strengthening of the ties
 with the working masses, concern which is displayed by your
 party and its Central Committee led by the true son of the
 Polish working class, our friend and comrade Edward Gierek."

 8 DECEMBER 1971
 The Soviet leader's tribute to Gierek fell somewhat short of his
 accolades for Kadar, Zhivkov, and Honecker at their respective
 party congresses.  In Budapest in November 1970, he hailed "that
 true son of the Hungarian people and outstanding and respected
 figure in the international communist and workers movement,
 Comrade Janos Kadar."  In Sofia in April 1971, he praised
 "the eminent leader of the international communist movement,
 our great friend, Comrade Todor Zhivkov."  And in East Berlin
 in June, he said "our respected friend and comrade Erich
 Honecker, a steadfast antifascist, an outstanding organizer
 of the party and state construction of the republic, enjoys
 the great confidence of communists and of all working people
 of the GDR."  In May at the Prague congress Brezhnev avoided
 a personal tribute to Husak, praising instead the CPCZ and
 "its leaders, Comrade Gustav Husak, Ludvik Svoboda, and
 others" and voicing thanks for the praise of the CPSU by
 "Comrade Gustav Husak and other comrades who have spoken here."
 Brezhnev stopped short of reiterating the limited-sovereignty
 concept that he had spelled out at the Polish party congress
 in November 1968, but he reminded the Poles that their
 "irrevocable" entry onto the path of socialism and into the
 "unified family of socialist countries" meant that their
 "freedom and independence are guaranteed once and for all
 and without conditions."  He prefaced this statement with a
 reference to the protection Poland enjoys by virtue of its
 membership in the Warsaw Pact.
 GIEREK REPORT     The PZPR leader balanced his denunciation
 of the negative legacy of Gomulka's
 leadership with praise for the fallen leader in a historical
 context.  He recalled that "great services were rendered to
 the party in the final -tage of the struggle against the
 Wazi invader and in the first years of the people's power by
 Wladyslaw Gomulka," praising also the early "contribution"
 by the purged Stalinist Bierut.
 In preparing the present congress, Gierek declared, the PZPR
 "bore in mind the bitter and painful experience of the social
 conflict which our country went through one year ago."  He
 went on to recall that the seventh and eighth plenums of the
 PZPR, in December and February, respectively, had "formulated
 a correct and exhaustive evaluation of the essence and
 causes of the December events."  He added:  "Our party has
 drawn the indispensable lessons and conclusions from the
 December events."

 8 DECEMBER 1971
 Without making any new direct attack on Gomulka's leadership,
 to judg,_ from PAP's sum:iary of the report, Gierek said "the
 errors in policy and deformations in the methods of management"
 which his regime had to overcome "arose first of all. from the
 infringement of the general Leninist norms of the construction
 of socialism."  Further underscoring the orthodoxy of the
 present Polish course, he said his regime had "restored the
 Leninist principles, overcome serious diffa.sulties, carried
 out a great work, and led the country onto the correct road."
 And he asserted Poland's "deep gratitude" to the fraternal
 parties, "particularly to the Communist Party of the Soviet
 Union, for having understood the essence of the difficulties
 we encountered."
 Gierek insisted that the Polish socialist state "under the
 existing conditions fulfils the function of the dictatorship
 of the proletariat" and declared that in party cadre policy
 and in "inner-party democracy," the observance of "Leninist
 teachings is the basic guarantee that socialist development
 will be continued correctly, without important errors and
 tremors."  Again underscoring fealty to the USSR, he stated
 that Poland's international policy has as its "cornerstone"
 fraternal relations with the Soviet Union.
 The PZPR leader's commitment to improve conditions for the
 populace was underscored by his preoccupation, during the
 bulk of the speech, with prospects in the 1971-75 plan for
 such features as increased consumer goods production, higher
 real wages, larger old-age and disability pensions, better
 housing, and increased agricultural production--still F5
 percent in the private sector in Poland, in contrast to
 generally complete collectivization in the other East
 European Warsaw Pact countries.  "The whole nation,"
 Gierek declared, "wants a more affluent and better life,"
 and "we have no right to frustrate those hopes and
 expectations."

 YUGOSLAVIA
 TITO REBUKES CROATIAN LEADERS, CALLS FOR PARTY CRACKDOWN
 President Tito used h'9 keynote     speech at the 21st League of
 Communists of Yugoslavia (LCY) Presidium meeting on 1-2 December
 in Karodordevo, Vojvodina, to denounce supporters of the Zagreb
 student strike and to make his harshest public attack to date on
 the Croatian party leadership.  Characterizing the strike--which
 began on 23 November as a p-otest against the foreign exchange
 system--as "a counterrevolutionary" act, he criticized the
 Croatian leaders for failing to take action to prevent it and
 for tolerating the existence of counterrevolutionary groups
 and activities in the republic.  In an evident effort to muster
 public support, particularly among the workers, for Tito's hard-
 line attitude toward the students and nationalist elements, the
 Yugoslav press gave the speech frontpage publicity and followed
 up with reports of widespread approval for it.
 In a windup speech the next day, however, Tito pulled back to a
 more conciliatory stance; and the Presidium's formal conclusions,
 while expressing "full support" for the assessment offered in
 Tito's keynote speech, made no reference to "counterrevolutionary"
 activity in Croatia and expressed confidence in the Croatian party
 leaders' ability to cope with their own "difficulties."  The
 Presidium's decision to adjourn the two-day meeting without taking
 action and to let the Croatians put their own house in order seems
 to reflect the reluctance of the major republican party leaders to
 set a precedent that might later be used against them.   It also
 points up the erosion of the federal party's authority in the wake
 of the decentralization process that has given unprecedented power
 to republic party leaders.
 Apparently capitulating to Tito's warning and to other pressures
 to end their walkout, the Zagreb students decided to return to
 class at a rally on the 3d.  But the Radio Belgrade account of
 the rally reported that the student leaders--in rebuttal to Tito's
 assessment of the strike--ina isted that it was not motivated by
 nationalism or chauvinism and "was not organized in conjunction
 with forces outside the country."

 8 DECEMBER 1971
 TITO SPEECHES     In his introductory speech to the Presidium on
 1 December, Tito revealed that he had met with
 the Croatian party leadership the day before and he,,, accused them
 of not having taken effective measures to prevent the student
 strike.  It was not just students who were responsiLle for the
 strike, Tito said, but also "negative elements whose trail clearly
 leads abroad" --an evident allusion to Croatian emigre groups.
 Accusing the Croatian leaders of "passivity" in the face of these
 "counterrevolutionary" activities, Tito angrily asserted that any
 attempt to make "excuses" for auch activities would amount to "a
 lack of vigilance, complacency, and rotten liberalism toward such
 elements."  More specifically, he went on to charge that the
 Croatian leadership was in effect tolerating the existence of
 "counterrevolutionary groups" where it should be taking "the
 sharpest action" against them.  In this context he mentioned the
 nationalistic cultural organization Matica Hrvtska and assailed
 the Zagreb daily VJESNIK for publishing "anticonstituttonal"
 statements. He also singled out anti-self-management activities
 of "the revolutionary committee of 50" as "counterrevolutionary."
 Noting in a broader context that the LCY is being "reorganized,"
 Tito repeated the familiar theme that the party has many members
 who should have been removed, and he recommended--as in the past,
 without naming them--that such people be expelled as soon as
 possible and that all "counterrevolutionary organizations" be
 dissolved.
 In his concluding speech to the Presidium on the 2d, Tito renewed
 his call for firm action against nationalist elements and "counter-
 revolutionary tendencies," but this time he assumed a generally
 more defensive posture and a more conciliatory stance toward the
 Croatian leadership.  Maintaining that he  as not calling for a
 return to the past and the launching of "a campaign," he expressed
 concern about what might happen in the future if present trends
 toward ideological erosion, particularly among the youth, continue.
 In an effort to spread the blame for present developments more
 broadly and to explain why he had singled out the Croatian party,
 he observed that it is not only the Croatian leaders who are
 responsible for recent developments.  Strikes, he said, have
 occurred in other republics, and "what happened in Croatia is
 the most drastic example."
 Leaving it to the present Croatian leaders to put their house in
 order, at least for the present, Tito stated that the reply to
 the strike can "primarily" be given by the Croatian party leaders

 themselves.  He acknowledged that his call for taking "adminis.-
 trative" measures against dissident elements had met with some
 opposition in the Presidium debate, declaring that those who
 object to his proposed actions as "undemocratic" and "cannot
 bear such action against counterrevolutionaries should get out
 of the League of Communists."
 LCY CONCLUSIONS     The LCY Presidium conclusions publicized on
 2 December, as reported by TANYUG, express
 support for Tito's attack on nationalism and chauvinism but take
 a far more positive attitude toward the Croatian party's ability
 to solve its own problems and a more conciliatory tack toward
 the students.  The Presidium expresses complete confidence in
 the ability of the League of Communists of Croatia and its Central
 Committee to overcome "existing difficulties, vacillation, and
 certain deviations with regard to ideological and political
 actions against nationalism of various colors and political
 tendencies taking cover under the guise of nationalism."
 The conclusions emphasize that it is the full responsibility of
 all Yugoslav communists, but primarily of republican &:.d provin-
 cial Central Committees, "to undertake, each in its own environ-
 ment, resolute ideological-political action against antisocialist
 trends."  They also stress that it is the responsibility of all
 communists in positions of authority to apply constitutional
 regulations without hesitation and to undertake "legal" measures
 against all individuals and groups which oppose the Yugoslav self-
 management system.  In a conciliatory gesture toward the students,
 the Presidium calls on republic central committees to create more
 favorable conditions for the functioning of democratic institutions
 and for efforts to overcome delays in solving economic problems.
 Avoiding any reference to "counterrevolutionary" activities or
 trends in Croatia, the TANYUG version of the document also fails
 to repeat Tito's charge that the strike was instigated from abroad.
 SOVIET REPORT     The 4 December PRAVDA ccrried a TASS report on
 Tito's 1 December address to the LCY Presidium,
 including his statement that counterrevolutionary groups and
 individuals are active in Croatia.  The account also singled out
 his statement that the most dangerous class enemies are chauvinism
 and nationalism.  Treating the LCY Presidium's conclusions very
 selectively, PRAVDA noted in one sentence that "the Presidium
 fully supports the assessments and position of Comrade Till and

 8 DECEMBER 1971
 CROATIAN MEETING     As reported by TANJUG on the 6th, the
 Croatian party executive committee met
 that day and issued a statement with mild overtones of self-
 criticism, vowing that the Croatian party and people are
 resolved "to remove shortcomings and to solve problems that
 have arisen in keeping with the policy of the LCY and the
 League of Communists of Croatia."
 Reporting to a party aktiv on the 7th, Dr. Vladimir Bakaric,
 a  LCY Executive Bureau member and leading Croatian party
 official, Lnformed his audience that Tito's criticism of nation-
 alistic manifestations in Croatia was "nothing new," but "it
 happened . . . that he had to tell us publicly that he did not
 agree with us."  TANJUG quoted Bakaric as remarking that it
 would "not be easy" to implement Tito's proposals.
 REBPUBLIC PARTY LEADERS DIFFER ON FEDERAL PARTY'S ROLE
 Differing views on how to deal with nationalist manifestations
 in the republics and on the role of the federal party were
 reflected clearly in comment at the republican level folliwing
 the two-day LCY Presidium session.  At a party aktiv meeting
 in Novi Sad on the 6th, praise for the "clear and sharp" approach
 in Tito's 1 December Presidium speech came from Mirko Caradanovich,
 head of the provincial committee of the League of Communists of
 Vojvodina, whom Tito had quoted approvingly in his second speech
 to the Presidium.  But Canadanovich remarked that the debate on
 the problem of nationalism had not been sufficiently "concrete,"
 As quoted by TANJUG, he noted that "the Presidium did not denounce
 anyone, nor did it endorse anyone's responsibility or further
 poi1L.. -il work."  Defending his concurrence in the Presidium
 decision to let the Croatians handle their own problems, he main-
 tained that any other course would have been "incompatible with
 our socialist relations" and would have played into the hands of
 Croat nationalists, who would have used any federal action as
 evidence that Croatia is not independent and that its policy is
 "in foreign hands."
 A more hardline approach to the federal party's role was taken
 by Bosnia-Hercegovina Executive Committee member Hasan Grab4anovic
 in an address to a local party conference on the 6th.  While
 granting that the principle that everyone should keep his own
 house in order is a good one, he added that "republics are not
 isolated islands, and it has been demonstrated that often we must
 keep our common house in order wt*h joint forces."

 In sharp contrast, the powerful Serbian party chief Marko Nikezic
 was quoted by TANJUG as malting a strong pitch for republican
 party autonomy in a speech to a group of local communists on the
 same day.  Nikezic stated that "nationalism in Croatia and any-
 where in Yugoslavia could only be beaten along democratic lines,
 not the line of bureaucratic centralism or conservatism or by
 a return to the earlier relations."  He added:  "Nobody can
 construct socialism in Croatia but the working class and communists
 of Croatia."

 MIDDLE EAST
 MOSCOW SAYS ISRAEL. U,S, OBSTRUCT PEACE SOUGHT BY ARABS
 Moscow comment pegged to the UNGA debate on the Middle East and
 Israeli Prime Minister Meir's 2 December meeting with President
 Nixon in Washington hews to the established line that the Arabs
 are seeking peace while Israel and its American supporters are
 thwarting these efforts.  Soviet commentators reiterate that
 Egypt's "initiative" in requesting the UNGA debate demonstrates
 its concern for a political settlement, while Mrs. Meir's U.S.
 visit illustrates Israel's focus on American military deliveries.
 Typifying the low-volume propaganda on the UNGA discussion and
 the Meir visit, a domestic service commentary on the 6th by
 former PRAVDA Middle East specialist Belyayev concluded that
 Israel has "stubbornly ignored" all UN and Arab efforts for a
 political settlement due to the support it has received from
 the United States.  Belyayev routinely charged that the United
 States, while verbally advocating peace and talking about
 mediation to reach a settlement, simultaneously supplies Israel
 with "modern offensive armaments."  He observed that Mrs. Meir
 "reached agreement" with the President "providing for Israel's
 long-term requirenents for modernizing and maintaining the level
 of its armed forces."  Washington, he said, justifies ouch
 actions; by the theory of balance of power, which means military
 superiority over the Arab forces.  Belyayev asserted that the
 United States, by its "ambiguous actions," is delaying a just
 settlement and also concealing its efforts to realize its own
 ambitions in the Middle East.
 Moscow continues to Firtray Israel as threatening Egypt with a
 new war.  Koryavin maintained in the 2 December IZVESTIYA that
 Tel Aviv intends to continue basing its policy on a military
 solution.  Touching on the possibility of further fighting, a
 commentary in Arabic on the 3d laid the blame for current
 tension on Israel's stubbornness which "may have a tragic
 result--the resumption of military operations."  Warily
 broaching Egyptian President as-Sadat's "request that 1971
 be a decisive year," a formula Moscow only belatedly and
 cautiously acknowledged, the broadcast called this "a natural
 anF'1er" to the Israeli attitude.  It rejected the U.S. and
 Israeli "noisy propaganda campaign" to present as-Sadat's
 position as the cause of the present tension:

 8 DECEMBER 1971
 UNGA DEBATE     Reporting Egyptian Foreign Minister Mahmud
 Riyad's 3 December speech on the opening ea.,
 of the UNGA Mideast discussion, TASS on the 4th noted that he
 called, in conclusion, for the application against Israel of
 "coercive measures provided for by the UN Charter."  A Soltan
 radio commentary on the 4th referred to the possibility of
 the application of sanctions in concluding that there are
 many opportunities open to the United Nations, "including the
 use of sanctions," and that the time has come to make use of
 them.
 Israeli Foreign Minister Eban's speech on 6 December was briefly
 reported by TASS, which described it as another confirmation
 of "the Israeli extremists' aggressive aspirations."  TASS said
 Eban declared Israel would make no pledges "beforehand" as to
 withdrawal from the occupied territories and that he cast doubt
 on the importance of Resolution 242.
 An unusual Soviet reference to differing interpre':ations of the
 November 1967 resolution appeared in an article by PRAVDA's
 Demchenko in the monthly 20TH CENTURY AND PEACE, reviewed by
 TASS on the 3d.  Asking rhetorically if the prolongation of the
 crisis could be ascribed to "a different interpretation" of
 the resolution, Demchenko acknowledged that "no doubt the
 resolution was the outcome of a compromise, and its paragraphs
 can be interpreted in various ways."  But it is still the
 recognized formula which can restore justice and peace in the
 area, he said, and it must be implemented without delay "before
 the situation boils up again."
 SOVIET LEADERS     Brezhnev, addressing the Polish party congress
 on 7 December, merely reiterated that the
 socialist countries are doing everythi.ng to "upset the plans of
 the Israeli predators and their patrons" and to help the Arabs
 "defend their lawful rights" and promote the establishment of a
 just peace.  In a speech on the 7th at a banquet for the visiting
 Yemeni leaders, Podgornyy voiced standard Soviet support for the
 Arab struggle and expressed confidence that the Arabs' efforts
 for a political settlement wou]jd be successful.  Podgornyy also
 reiterated charges, last made in October, of "imperialist
 and Zionist" efforts to split the "national patriotic forces"
 in the Arab countries, stressing that such intrigues should not

 disturb the Arabs if they join efforts in their common struggle,
 if "the interests of each agree with the interests of all,"
 and if "sincere willingness" to strengthen unity is shown.*
 Moscow radio announced on the 7th that Defense Minister Grechko
 would be paying an "official friendly visit" to Iraq, Syria,
 and Somalia--no mention of Egypt--in the second half of
 December.  The IRAQI NEWS AGENCY had reported in mid-May
 that Grechko had accepted an invitation from his Iraqi
 counterpart to visit Iraq toward the end of the year.
 *  The importance of Arab unity and warnings of "imperialist"
 efforts to disunite the Arabs and disrupt their friendship with
 the USSR were pressed by Soviet leaders and in Moscow propaganda
 in October, during Kosygin's Algerian and Moroccan visits and
 the visits of the PDRY prime minister and Egyptian President
 as-Sadat to Moscow.  Emphasis on these themes had diminished
 since as-Sadat's visit.
